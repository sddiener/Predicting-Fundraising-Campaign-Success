The Chosen is a game about freedom. Freedom to choose your own path and influence the destiny of the entire Galactic Comunity.
About a year ago, I got the idea for The Chosen, and I immediately knew it could be something huge. So I started work on the cinematic trailer. Once that was finished, and I saw the reactions of the people I showed it to, I decided to take the year off from college and started working on The Chosen full time. About 2 months later, the demo was finished.






With YOUR help, The Chosen has the potential to become the most massive and immersive open-world online game there is!
The Chosen will feature 6 different playable RACES:




You can read more about each one HERE.
Each race will have it's own ships, and aside from capital ships, each class can be shared between races:







Read more about the various ship classes here.




Voice Chat With NPCs - This feature will allow you to interact with many NPCs by talking to them using your microphone. (playable in the demo)
Persistent Universe - Meaning that your actions have consequences, and they will determine your alignment in the game. But just like in real life, nothing is set in stone.
Advanced Combat - You will be able to implement advanced combat tactics, like boarding parties, for example. Send your friends to the enemy ship and take it over, or destroy it from the inside.
Custom ship interiors - You can modify the layout of your ships when in dry-dock (ie. placing each room and module, and even ""decorate"" the rooms).
Democracy vs Dictatorship - When you find a new inhabited planet you will have a choice: you can open diplomatic relations with the planet and get access to their resources, remain neutral or you can try to enslave the planet. If you succeed in enslaving them you will get access to their resources and tech, but your ships will be prone to sabotage and you will have to quell any uprisings. Enslaved planets CAN be liberated by other players.

<p>This is a much different approach than almost any park yet in existence, which split up groups to go to many maps, where new players must wait for a game to start. We will have one large map, in which are several start points, captured by each faction. When your faction captures a point, joining players may start there, and which faction has what points are logged everyday at closing, deciding start points the next day. The game ends when only one faction remains or all remaining factions agree on the beginning of a new game. Each faction's victories are posted, and rewards are given to the faction with the most wins after every tournament period of six months.</p>

In the heart of the map will be a settlement town of small buildings, set up after the collapse of society. This will be a major battleground, as the town will contain four of the capture points. Each faction will begin in a corner of the map, equal distances from the town. other capture points will be scattered throughout the wooded area. </span><br/>

We want to make a new experience in paintball, where you select one of four factions, and join the game immediately. 
This is a much different approach than almost any park yet in existence, which split up groups to go to many maps, where new players must wait for a game to start. We will have one large map, in which are several start points, captured by each faction. When your faction captures a point, joining players may start there, and which faction has what points are logged everyday at closing, deciding start points the next day. The game ends when only one faction remains or all remaining factions agree on the beginning of a new game. Each faction's victories are posted, and rewards are given to the faction with the most wins after every tournament period of six months.


The map itself will consist of an approximately 20 acre swath of wooded land (see image) wooded with light trees, and has been freshly logged, leaving debris giving the air of the Apocalypse. In the heart of the map will be a settlement town of small buildings, set up after the collapse of society. This will be a major battleground, as the town will contain four of the capture points. Each faction will begin in a corner of the map, equal distances from the town. other capture points will be scattered throughout the wooded area. 



   What We Need
    
The above is a preliminary breakdown and estimation of our $116,000 budget. As we understand this is a very large goal, we have taken a fair amount of time working  it in detail. The majority of the money is going towards the building of the town, due to the high cost of wood.

Another large chunk of the budget is the property (See above picture) more property details are available here.
About 15% of the budget is devoted to the purchase of 50 sets of paintball supplies such as: 



Tippmann A5 Paintball Markers

HPA Tanks 
HPA Compressor
Starting Paintballs

Two very small sums are set aside for the purchase of insurance and the formation of an LLC for legal matters.
A very small amount is being set aside for small unforeseen costs, taxes, and fees under the category ""In Case of Emergency"".

My name is Chiara Russomanno,I’m a cartoon designer and I have many friends who are
keen on videogames. Some of them are very expert (in this matter), so I started
a working party to create 
original videogames.                          The Game
A village of Marshmallows
is under threat by a terrible monster! Each day a magician named Ent, calls for the sacrifice of one of
the marshmallows. One of these is sweet Lea
who is chosen to be sacrificed. A lot of fear surrounds the marshmallows
village. 
But why does the monster always torment them? 
What does he do with all the victims that are given to
him?
What does a gummy bear do in a marshmallows village?
And above all: will clumsy Bob be able to save his beloved Lea?
The Challenges
Marshmallow
Adventure is a challenge to your genius and speed. You will have to set traps,
kill monsters, dodge ghosts, recover keys… 
Lea will not be the
only one in danger. How difficult will it be for a little marshmallow, slob
such as Bob, to save her! Within the levels there will be other victims of the
monster. 
Will Bob be able
to save them and to overcome new and unforeseen difficulties?
Puzzle or action?
Marshmallow Adventure is a platform game somewhere
between puzzle and  adventure game, you can
choose two approaches to pass from level to level. One is more fast and instinctive, where you
will have to eliminate the monsters before they eliminate you. 
The second approach is more difficult, where you will
have to examine the environment to set traps and to drink potions in order to overcome
the obstacles. It’s your choice!

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>While the base mechanics of the game are fully built and playable, this project is currently under development by a single developer, and to be completely transparent we need to hire a network developer to make sure the ""multiplayer"" component of the multiplayer game works as intended. With your support and funding we will be able to afford to hire on an experienced network developer that can make sure this game runs properly and you won't run into any issues once you're in and playing with your friends! </p>
<p>What's in it for you? We want to get the community as involved with the development of this project as possible, that's why we have decided to make an early build of the game available to testing right now for immediate feedback and reactions as early on in development as possible. You can download the current demo <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wjV9USdbBJfrnanFJVAK_aMNMdcfY0PC/view?usp=sharing"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</p>
<p>What if we don't reach our funding goal? This project is important to us and we will make sure to do as much with whatever we get to continue to make this project great and get it into your hands.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>With your support, we can make this project not only a reality, but we can make this great and make this the game we have all been waiting for.</p>
<p>With the recent success of games like ""Among Us"" many people have been looking forward to a similar style of game but for VR, and that is what we aim to accomplish with this project, an online murder mystery part game for VR!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We are confident in our ability to make this project a reality. As you can tell from the currently playable demo  of the project our team has the ability to bring this project to life and with just a bit of your help we can really polish this project and make something great! Since we already have the major components of the project completed there is nearly zero risk involved in this project!</p>
<p>To maintain your trust and support, we will be giving the community a very important role in development! We are doing this by continuing to release alpha builds of the project to backers leading up to Early Access launch on Steam so we can continue to get your user feedback and improve the overall gameplay experience. </p>
<p>Lastly, we will never delete comments or silence the voices of our community. The core of this project is community-driven and we never want to take that away from you. Not only do we want to use these platforms to communicate updates on development, but most importantly we want to be sure your voice is always heard.</p>

<p>“<i>And now here is my secret, a very simple secret: It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.</i>” ― Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, The Little Prince</p>
<p>Did you happen to notice that our planet is polluted too fast? That many unique animals are just fading away? Can we do something to help our planet? The core idea of the PaperWorld - saving nature by playing game, since part of the game purchases goes to the Wildlife Protection Fund. Most animals species in the game are in the red list, or their population has decreased too much recently. And it may happen that only books will keep the memories of those animal kinds. Our planet is a fragile, very complex and beautiful world, where everything is related to everything. But tearing page after page from this piece of art, we are moving towards the final act, without thinking about the consequences. In fact, human being is not the author of this book of life, but introduces his own corrections, as a full-fledged master, rewriting the chapter after chapter. Our team hopes that various people playing our game will learn to feel the importance of nature.  </p>
<p>The goals of the game: taking care of animals, exploring location in which those animals live and learning the facts about the wild. The main message of the gameplay for adults is to get distracted from the everyday routine in which we forget that we are an important part of this world. The game does not require online connection or concentrated activities, just immerse yourself into ambient music, play with your favorite animals and relax.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1532957517/lq8c3tfgpxxmscoghswc.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>So how do we play the PaperWorld? First we need to assemble an animal model from a sheet of paper. Most of us have assembled origami in our childhood and in the PaperWorld the process is not much more complex. We get the desired animal model by bending each piece at a certain angle. This way we get the animal part assembled. After all animal parts are ready the animal will come to life in a magical way.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1532957653/vvy6krrexafxyuih744o.png"" src=""""/></h3>
<p>Starting from this moment we continue to the core game mechanic - the location exploration. However we have not limited the player imagination. A player may put a polar bear into the savannah, or puma into the arctic environment. Nevertheless the game hints will teach and talk about what is habitual for an animal, where it lives and what it eats.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1532957690/hqs8snorvq2ecvrmu5mu.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Hints and facts appear near the interactive zones, where different actions take place. The more carefully you explore the location, the more such facts you will find. Moreover different parts of the game world contain various mini games. There are four varieties of mini-games, but depending on the location and mini-game itself it has a unique look and various interesting facts. </p>
<p>For example, you can run in the classic runner, avoiding obstacles on the river, while learning that grizzlies are very fond of fishing, since fish is rich in proteins, and grizzlies may often be found near ponds where fish is abundant.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1532960214/mn5ktlkowuufaci0otvc.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Finding matches is an excellent game for training memory. Identify the matching cards, going through different difficulty levels. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1532960696/xl9jpevddsupqjxncw6d.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>And if you wish to try some mini-game for a lucky then hidden treasure is the right game for you. Compete with a dexterous fox or fast jaguar, trying to find the hidden location treasures faster than the opponent. Of course, you can play this mini-game with any animal you like, but we would not recommend to play it with pumas or bears. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/kh0devqnij6yzxc/Runner.gif?dl=0"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Catch them all mini-game will teach you how to look after children. Those fumbles constantly strive to escape, but your mission is to pull them back into safe area much like a responsible family head would do.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/752fkcvxg53ttis/Cta.gif?dl=0"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Another interesting PaperWorld entertainment feature is augmented reality. The feature allows to view or take a shoot with an animal of your choice through your phone’s camera. </p>
<p>Earn the care hearts, gather protection crystals, relax from the routine under calming music and do not forget that the world needs your care.</p>

<p>We believe that the community needs to know about this game in advance and we believe you would be inspired as much as we are. We have a lot of features that could be added to the game making it more interesting but we just cannot work on them because of a limited budget.

<p>This game inspires all of us a lot. The team has enough experience working in the gaming industry and we already see the pre-alpha version of the game looks visually great. We have specifically designed the PaperWorld as a low poly game as it looks similar to paper-crafted world. The low-poly objects are not so resource demanding especially for mobile devices. Yet this is a big challenge for us to fight for our auditory and bring the game to success, remove all bugs and improve performance and user experience. However we have enough time to complete the game and we do not rush to publish the game without careful and throughout testing and playing many hours until we are happy with it. Hence the challenge we see is shifting of deadlines and publishing the game later than we expect. We do believe the publishing will not lag too much from the initial release date and will not disappoint all of your supporters for sure.</p>
<p>There are no other major risks since the game is being actively developed on behalf of our team members although we cannot afford too much features with such a small team of us. Raising funds on IndieGoGo will help us to add more unique content and loveable features. We will also extend the gameplay so that everyone will not be disappointed. Each one of you will be also part of the game if you support it here on IndieGoGo.</p>
<p>We believe in the game industry and want to make the best games in the world. Don’t miss the chance to back the project and be the part of it! In case you cannot back the project for any reason then please spread the word about the campaign! Thank you all for your support!</p>

It's still in progress, but we want to share it with you and hear your thoughts. ✌  Please add Pocket Bravery to your Wishlist on STEAM. Make sure to check it out!  Pocket Bravery is an original fighting game, made completely hand drawn in pixel art, with a dynamic and responsive gameplay, focused on the characters’ animations with the aim to get fluidity during matches.In this example, a single attack has 22 individual frames​ The game is inspired by classics from the 90s, such as Street Fighter, Fatal Fury and The King of Fighters. And its SD aesthetic was influence on games like Pocket Fighter and other fighting games from Neo Geo Pocket Color. But make no mistake, Pocket Bravery was created to be a new and unique fighting game, with original characters, vibrant colors an impressive combat system, designed with high-level players in mind. For beginners, we created a set of features that will teach them how to improve and evolve. The game uses a digital pad and four buttons., two punches and two kicks. You can combine  directional inputs and buttons to execute traditional commands from fighting games such as specials, super specials or even Final Attacks.  Elemental SystemEach character has an element that represents their strength. An element can be physical or supernatural. You can accumulate up to 2 attacks on the elemental bar. Through this system, it is possible to execute elemental attacks that have different characteristics from the others and bring new offensive or defensive possibilities for the player: Cancel SystemE.CancelIt allows the player to cancel special attacks into elemental attacks, spending the elemental gauge and half of the power gauge. S.CancelThis system allows the player to cancel special attacks into super specials. Like E.Cancel, this also has a cost: 1 stock of the Power Bar plus half of it. ​TauntDuring a match, provocations can bring advantages and disadvantages. When you taunt, the opponent can lose half of their power bar due to being angry. Depending on their personality or relationship with your character, different reactions can happen. Be careful, though: During the taunt animation, the character is vulnerable to attacks. BreakerThe best defense against an opponent's pressure, it can be done while blocking or being hit. It costs half of the elemental bar.  Character StatusIn the character selection screen, along with the fighter's portrait, there are 4 attributes that describe their gameplay: Strength, Speed, Range and Difficulty. You can see them in more detail by pressing the Details button. In this menu, you can check their bio, that includes their nationality, full name, abilities, archetype and some of their input commands. This can help a beginner to know if a character fits with their  preferred gameplay style. ShortcutsIf you are still learning, you’ll have the possibility to use simplified commands. This way you only need to press a single button to make special, super special moves or the final attack. To enable this feature, just go to the options or do it directly on the character selection screen. (Not available on Online Matches). AccessibilityWe implement colorblind effects and are working to bring more accessibility options to the final version of the game.  LanguagesThe game will feature 12 languages, (this number may increase, depending on our fans). We want our product to be accessible for players who speak totally different languages. Other Features- Arcade mode- VS mode- Online mode- Training mode- Combo Maker (original mode to teach beginners in fighting games how to make combos. We'll show more details in near future)  In Pocket Bravery, a strange phenomenon happened in the world. But only a few people are able to feel and manifest it. There are those who throw energy through their hands, others reinforce their muscles, while certain specialists transfer their essence to objects and weapons. Nobody understands exactly what is happening and everyone tries to discover this mystery in their own way. In the middle of all this, Matilha, a criminal organization, wants to steal ancient artifacts and relics that involve several nations and notable individuals.Regretful for making all the wrong decisions possible, Nuno seeks redemption, and with that, gets courage to face his parents again. During this journey, he will have to deal with several bad revelations about himself and the source of his powers. But it will not be easy to let go of his bad habits.For someone who once hated practicing martial arts and preferred to stay at the computer, Mingmei became a skilled master in kung fu, showing how brilliant she was in different things in her life. However, everything comes with a price: for feeling guilty for the theft of a mystical artifact, she devoted all of her time to fulfill tradition and correct things.There are many ways to feel an adrenaline rush. For Sebastian, the best of them is to win a competition. And his favorite competition is to arrest criminals, even though he’s now walking between being one or not. But in his mind it is a necessary evil to clean up his reputation tainted by corrupt people at Interpol, and who knows, one day, to recover his badge.Motivated by strong feelings, Hadassa seeks answers to a crime that occurred in her life. This goal has always been in her mind, and when the opportunity came, she didn't think twice about pursuing clues, certain that she has enough capacity to smash the face of anyone who comes her way.Ekon Ndidi is a pacifist man, but everything has a limit. After having his village invaded by a criminal organization and having his petition ignored by the government and the United Nations, he realized that to win the peace of his people it will be necessary to fight. With a great physical and spiritual strength, Ndidi is willing to change the destiny of the people of his land.A world karate champion with only 17 years old, Kimberly put all her physical and mental fitness to the test when she joined the CIA and participated in dangerous missions, to unfortunately get away from the job she loved after discovering that not everything was as it seemed. Unable to do nothing, she founded Eagle, a private intelligence and espionage agency. With this, she is now able to keep put fear in all kinds of terrorist threats. She came from the lowest strata of society, and because of this Malika understands the value of wealth better than anyone, being a successful businesswoman who thinks about different social causes, especially the spread of drugs to children from poor neighborhoods, since her brother ran away from home for the same reason. But unfortunately to solve the problem of the neighborhood in which she was born, she will need to deal with people capable of unreal things.Some fight for a cause, others for money, but Arshavin fights for fame. Determined to be the greatest fighter ever, this man of colossal strength does not know the word ""limit"" when he comes to exchanging punches with a worthy opponent. However, fame can blind us, and this aim to be recognized puts him in bad situations.Daisuke was a man who put his duty above everything, but after failing, he saw himself only as a dishonor with no place in the world. Full of negative feelings, he is sure that he will only redeem himself when he gets his revenge, but does not realize how he is leaving the things that really matter behind.Ximena is a woman covered by mystery. Some think she is capable of talking to Death, others think she is Death itself. Regardless of your opinion, the only certainty is that she is an incredibly skilled killer, capable of eliminating you in a blink of an eye. After all, killing is not a pleasure, since her true pleasures are traveling and enjoying life. In the end, killing is just another business. Unlock all the community goals to meet the boss of the game.   Our stages have animations and variations for each of the 3 rounds. They were created to match with the characters and the story we want to tell.6 of the 10 stages we are showing are based on real locations. Can you recognize what they are?    If the $ 30,000 extended goal is reached, the game will receive a new game mode called TAG STRIKE, which will be played in doubles battles, in the already traditional TAG system (as in Mortal Kombat 9 or The King Fighters XI), but in addition, the player will have the help of assistants, who must be chosen from extra characters (as in Marvel vs Capcom or The King of Fighters 2000).Master level supporters (or higher) will be able to have their own character as an assistant, be it some original character or some character made from scratch for our universe.   If the $ 40,000 extended goal is reached, the game will have a story mode that will tell all the events of Pocket Bravery.

With gameplay adaptations on the smartphone screen.  If the $ 70,000 extended goal is reached, the character Son Ji Sung + his stage + his theme song will be produced and available as a DLC in a future update.  If the $ 80,000 extended goal is reached, the character Homero Silva + his stage + his theme song will be produced and available as a DLC in a future update.  If the $ 90,000 extended goal is reached, the character Brandon Carter + their stage + their theme song, will be produced and available as a DLC in a future update.  If the $ 100,000 extended goal is reached, the character “?” + their stage + their theme song, will be produced and available as a DLC in a future update.Unlock two community goals to meet this character.  If the $ 110,000 extended goal is reached, the character “?” + their stage + their theme song, will be produced and available as a DLC in a future update.Unlock three community goals to meet this character.  Unlock four community goals to reveal this reward.  Unlock five community goals to reveal this reward. The more, the merrier!

 In terms of basic content, approximately 50% - 60% of the game is done.  If the project is funded we will start working on the game's online mode on July 2021, which will be via GGPO on the Rollback Netcode system. And if we reach our goal, even if a minimal amount of unforeseen events appears, Pocket Bravery will be released for PC (Windows, Mac and Linux), Nintendo Switch, Playstation 4, Playstation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X / S in the second semester of 2022. We have already released another game, which is part of the same universe as Pocket Bravery, called Guns N’ Runs. It’s a stylish platform, action and shooting game, containing super specials and fast-paced Dash mechanics. In summary, it’s a game that refers to classics like Mega Man, Metal Slug and Celeste. Guns N' Runs is available on STEAM.             We are partnered with Razer! We received recognition and support from Razer, who kindly approached us and sent us some peripherals, (keyboard, mouse, headphone and different types of joysticks), to facilitate our work in the development of Pocket Bravery. Thanks, Razer! This is a special stage. It will be available to everyone at the game release. (You can also create yours, however you want, if you are a Warlord supporter or higher)Everything we have done has been financed by our personal savings, some services provided to third parties and the help of some friends and family. However, to continue creating the game, we need your help. Our goal is to finish Pocket Bravery, no matter how long it takes, but we want to keep the development at full speed, as has been done so far. However, due to the high investment in the project and the need to maintain a quality team, our resources have been exhausted.And precisely at this very important and decisive moment that we chose Indiegogo. We understand that every money collected will be extremely important to keep the team focused on developing the game.Furthermore, we really want to hear a big ""YES"" from our fans and other potential players, enough to feel confident that Pocket Bravery is a game that people want to see launched.And it is also well known that the value of a Indiegogo goes well beyond the amount raised during the campaign, being here provides us with the best initial feedback cycle that a game studio can expect. We are committed to this project and want confirmation that Pocket Bravery is something you want. We want to thank everyone who has supported us since the beginning and you who are getting to know us right now. We want you to know that we are grateful for this opportunity to have some of your time and interest in our Kickstarter campaign.Sharing our project with your friends, family and social media would be a huge help for us.

<p>We have developed a framework which allows the simple creation of board games using this technology and a community site to allow you to share your creations with the world, joining like minded people in collaborative development of groundbreaking game ideas.</p>
<p>The Open Board Game allows you to easily design and build your game using components such as interlocking board pieces, figurines, cards, dice and even interactive electronic elements.</p>

<p>We have been developing the Open Board Game framework bricks for over 6 months, working with hundreds of prototypes and possible layouts.

<h2>The First 3D Printed Board Game</h2>
To fully test the OBG framework we created example games to inspire the community to work with us to develop this new type of board game.

<p>Rust to Dust, is an advance wars style strategy battle game with 56 fantastic Battle Robot Figurines. This first game to be designed to work with the interlocking board pieces of the open board game is our test bed and we want to involve you the community in its final stage development.</p>

<h4>Polished Gold and Nickel plated steel</h4>
<p>This material is 3D printed 420 Stainless Steel infused with bronze, and has a final composition of approximately 60% steel and 40% bronze.It is then Enrobed in 24k gold and polished to a mild sheen but retains visible print lines.</p>

<h4>Polished Gold Plated on Brass</h4>
<p>Precious Plated Metals are cast in Shapeways’ Brass before going through extensive hand polishing to create a smooth surface texture. After being cast, we underplate the brass with palladium to provide strength and durability. Your products are then plated with .5 microns of the precious metal of choice. The outcome is a beautiful shiny luster with a high level of detail and smooth surface finish.</p>
<p>Shapeways' Brass consists of 15% zinc, 5% tin, and 80% copper. The palladium and precious metal electroplatings are about .5 micron each, but this can vary based on geometry.</p>

<h4>Sterling Silver</h4>
<p>Polished silver is lightly hand polished to achieve a smooth finish but still can have some surface texture.</p>
<p>3D Printed Sterling Silver products are made using a three-step process. The products are created with a lost-wax casting process using a high-resolution 3D wax printer. The 3D printed wax model is put in a container and liquid plaster is poured around it to create a mold. After the plaster sets, the wax is melted out and molten silver is poured into the plaster mold. The plaster is then pulled away to reveal the silver and the finished product is polished for a smooth surface.</p>
<p>Polishing gives this material a beautiful finish, but can have an impact on fine details. During the polishing step, fine or sharp-edged details may be polished down.</p>

<h4>Strong flexible plastic</h4>
<p>To 3D print in this material, Shapeways start with a bed of Nylon powder and sinter the powder with a laser layer by layer, solidifying the powder as they go. Some visible print lines may occur, but a final polish stage usually eliminates most of this. </p>

</div></div>","Whether you want to design your own professional board game or play the amazing creations of others, the Open Board Game makes it easy using the latest in 3D printing and hacker electronics.
We've been making games for 25 years and been developing for 3D printing for the last three. We're passionate about gaming and we want you to revolution the way board games are produced, new technology allows you to do just that.

The advent of 3D printing means you can self manufacture amazing games created and designed by you and the community.
Don't have a printer, no worries, read about 3D printing services here.
An Open Framework
We have developed a framework which allows the simple creation of board games using this technology and a community site to allow you to share your creations with the world, joining like minded people in collaborative development of groundbreaking game ideas.
The Open Board Game allows you to easily design and build your game using components such as interlocking board pieces, figurines, cards, dice and even interactive electronic elements.


At the core of the Open Board Game framework is a standardized set of interlocking hexagonal bricks that can make up an infinite variety of impressive 3D board landscapes.
These bricks are designed in such a way as to be 3D printed quickly and hassle free on standard home machines for a few cents each. 




We have been developing the Open Board Game framework bricks for over 6 months, working with hundreds of prototypes and possible layouts. The result is a trouble free, easy to print, interconnecting board that can be adapted and refined by you, the community. The standard models are completely open and you can download the models here, to print, hack, modify, use and share freely in your own creations. In addition we've included internal support structures so lights, servos, sensors and complete mini controllers can all be included inside the bricks to make parts move and interact with your game design.You can find out more at our web site.
The First 3D Printed Board Game
To fully test the OBG framework we created example games to inspire the community to work with us to develop this new type of board game.
 
Rust to Dust, is an advance wars style strategy battle game with 56 fantastic Battle Robot Figurines. This first game to be designed to work with the interlocking board pieces of the open board game is our test bed and we want to involve you the community in its final stage development.


The robots have 3 classes,  Range, Bruiser and Infantry, each with their own benefits and weaknesses. Attributes that are defined on their accompanying collectible playing cards.
 
Each robot is unique but has inherited features from its clan. We are producing 56 unique robot figurines, two clans of 14 robots each with 4 Bruiser class, 4 Range class and 6 Infantry class robots in 2 poses each. 

Each of these models is unique, created to the highest standard by our artists and ready for 3D printing. 


The game is at first playable stage and over the next two months we will be working to refine the game play with you, and in doing so improve the Open Board Game framework and Community Site. We launched this crowd funding campaign to help us achieve that and at the same time raising awareness of the Open Board Game framework. We hope this example game will inspire you and others to build thousands more games using the Open Board pieces.





To thank you for your help we will make full sets of our robot models available to you for home printing. If you don't have access to a home printer we also offer to professionally print the models using a high end printing service. 

Each one of our backers will also get access to our beta Member's site before the general public has. We currently have two example games, Rust to Dust which is in first playable state, and Miomon, a Pokemon like card game in early concept stage. On the member's site you can download game rules and supporting files, join or start discussions on game improvements or even suggest your own new games and help us begin the board game revolution.

Why Crowd Funding
We are passionately into the board game concept and believe you will be too. A crowd funding campaign helps us (and our backers) gauge the response the idea has, and a successful campaign will allow us to pursue this dream.
The raised funds represent two months costs for our 5 strong team of gaming professionals. Allowing us to dedicate our focus to improvements in game play, complete the second clan designs and improve the Community website.







Getting the idea out into the public eye at beta stage allows us to refine the idea with the communities feedback and give the best possible experience to you.

Stretch goals will include additional designs exclusively for you the backer but will also allow us to deliver more free designs to be available to all.






And overwhelming support of our project by you will allow us to cheaply mass manufacturer the most common basic components of the board bricks, making the Open Board Game concept available to more people, able to build bigger designs more cheaply. 



Risks & Challenges


 Its always worrying to back a campaign with unknowns. So we wanted to remove that risk for you, that is why we have already built all 28 of the models in the Doppler Clan and will have completed the Euler Clan before the end of the campaign. All of the perks 3d printed by Shapeways are already complete and ready.  You can see each of the Doppler clan models by following this link to our gallery, and we will be posting regular updates and images on The Euler Clan models over the following weeks.

3D printing is also a very challenging and sometimes frustrating technology. 

 

We understand and have overcome the difficulties encountered in every printing process from home FDM or SLS machines to the latest and most high end printing machines used by services such as Shapeways. Most importantly, we have the know-how to build impressive game figures to take advantage of these new processes. For further independent validation on our ability to deliver, Gartner, the world's leading IT research and advisory company, recommended us as one of the top five coolest companies in 3D printing in their industry report, and MakerBot approached us as one of 8 companies to become part of their MakerBot Ready Apps program when it was launched at the end of last year.
Other Ways You Can Help

 If you can't contribute no problem. We are trying to build a community of open freely distributed models and ideas. You can already download the board pieces as they are totally free to the community. If we succeed we will be able to deliver more free models into the community. 

Regardless of if you back the project or not, if we are successful we will release a basic set of models to build the game for anyone to freely download, print and play. Backers will get the added benefit of up to 56 beautiful robot models to build a fantastic army.
And our stretch goals have more free stuff too. So help us tell the world!

<h3>About me</h3>
<p>I am a design engineer. My love for mechanisms appeared in childhood. Once I saw the manuscripts with works by Da Vinci, I wanted to do something like that. Now it has become possible with the appearance of a 3D printer. I decided that it would be interesting to you.</p>
<h3>What do I want</h3>
<p>Da Vinci had a great engineering mind that the people who lived with him at one time, might not appreciate. Most inventions of Da Vinci it was impossible to realize with the help of tools XV - XVI centuries. All technical genius idea remained only on paper - in pictures, the drawings and detailed description. Only five centuries later, people who read the manuscript, tried to embody the idea of Da Vinci to life by designing mechanisms for his drawings. </p>
<p>I set myself the task to design a part of the machinery with the ability to reproduce their home. Not only repeating appearance. But all the moving parts. </p>

</div></div>","About me
I am a design engineer. My love for mechanisms appeared in childhood. Once I saw the manuscripts with works by Da Vinci, I wanted to do something like that. Now it has become possible with the appearance of a 3D printer. I decided that it would be interesting to you.
What do I want
Da Vinci had a great engineering mind that the people who lived with him at one time, might not appreciate. Most inventions of Da Vinci it was impossible to realize with the help of tools XV - XVI centuries. All technical genius idea remained only on paper - in pictures, the drawings and detailed description. Only five centuries later, people who read the manuscript, tried to embody the idea of Da Vinci to life by designing mechanisms for his drawings. 
I set myself the task to design a part of the machinery with the ability to reproduce their home. Not only repeating appearance. But all the moving parts. 




 



If I see an interest in my work, I think many of them will be completed before the end of the company. Already fully ready to the first model of a catapult. Works on the following devices are conducted. 
The entire construction process is described in the instructions. It does not pose any difficulty, and possible even a child!


 




 
Now you have the opportunity to receive files for printing at discount prices!

<h3>One More Night</h3>
<p>Majority of the people love horror stories. It's no secret that horror movies get so many profit, people would love to watch and feel the scary experience from the characters they saw in the movie. But, horror game is a bit different, instead of watching you can experience it like your own. You can move the character around in the way you wanted. From that idea, I inspired to create a horror game with a decent story over it.</p>
<p>This game is not just a walk around the cave or a maze or a house and get ready to be spooked of for no reason. This game has it's own purpose, this game has it own stories.</p>
<p>I love originality. I inspired by some mechanics or stories, yes, but I can ensure you to full plot of this game is pure my own creation. Oh, I got some friends that gave me suggestion to add on the story too.</p>
<p>As a game developer, I'm a new one. I always love game and I always love story-telling. I maybe new, but I have confidence that people who play One More Night will experience something different and try to understand the full plot of the game.</p>
<p>This project is a dream for me, and I can't thank you enough for anyone who are willing to help me in any way they can.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Progress so far?</h3>
<p>Yes, there is a progress so far. Like the trailer you already can see from this page (YouTube), the video is animated, I didn't take it from the actual game. Inside the real game might be a bit different (because of the adds-on) but the basic layout is decided. That's why the trailer is already seen. I might add another trailer by the time goes, but it depends on how this campaign is going.</p>
<p>The funding we needed is relatively small for a game. Unfortunately, my basic is not a programmer nor the 3D artist. That's I need the funding the pay them. I see myself as the director. I give them the concept and they are fulfilling my vision.</p>
<p>But, most of the funding is for marketing-correlation. I'm thinking of paying Youtuber or Instagram or any kind of marketing. I developed a game before, it went south very quickly because I didn't prepare any fund for marketing, lesson learned.</p>
<p>There are many Youtubers I like for the horror games. Markiplier, Jacksepticeye, Pewdiepie, etc, I don't know how much they worth to feature my game but my goal is for my game to be featured in their channel. Markiplier in my favorite to be honest, so he is my main goal. After that, I will let, hopefully, the ball rolling itself.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Campaign</h3>
<p>I'm really grateful about this platform, Indiegogo is a new knowledge for me. There are some of my friends already willing to help me in funding, Indiegogo is the platform I give them and hopefully others to contribute.</p>
<p>Your help, no matter what package you will pick is mean the world to me. It makes me one step closer to really make a living with something I really passionate about.</p>
<p>Like I mentioned, I developed a game before, it's a mobile game called ""Release the Snake"" but the game haven't updated more than a year so I don't think it will pop up in your App Store or Play Store. If you do find it, go for the credits and you will find my name.</p>
<p>So, to be fair, I'm a rookie in this department. But I believe in my taste and I confident most of people will enjoy the story I represent through this game. One think I will ensure you guys, I will make this game available if the funding is reached. You don't have to be afraid that your help will go in vain. To show my confident I will leave you my personal social media so you guys can reach me out and ask about the development.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>Breaking the Wall</h3>
<p>Everything usually not go as smooth as we planned, but I'm ready for any bumps ahead. I will fight for my backers to complete the game even though this campaign is not reaching it's milestone.</p>
<p>The main obstacle is I will need the exact number of money to pay the programmers and artists. But, I will try anything so this game can be come true. I may ask other's help personally or find an investor that can share my vision.</p>
<p>After all, this is my passion.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Goalkeeper</h3>
<p>Striker usually scored the goals, midfielder usually assist the ball. But even a goalkeeper has an important part to keep the team become the winning side.If you are not interested on investing in this campaign, hey, I''m grateful enough by you reading through this page.</p>
<p>I believe you know others who will interested to help us completing this campaign. Please, feel free to share this link to them. You can just share our first trailer in YouTube (<a href=""https://youtu.be/H4jLgaGx9tQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://youtu.be/H4jLgaGx9tQ</a>) comment on the comment section, leave a like. It's a major help for me too if the trailer can be seen by a lot of people.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>I'm not going to say something like, ""Oh, I really need money because I was raised poorly"" or some crap like that, because that would be lying, so far, I've lived a pretty good life, any money donated here would just help make my dreams of producing video games as a job, come true!<p>I will use the money to (1) help pay for game development software (2) to make sure the games can stay free. (3) help make sure I can keep producing these games.</p>

<p>
</p>
<p>Through rigorous

<p>- Fractals: Our

principles.</p>

<p>- New Characters: We have several

<p>- Bring BoxFighter

<p><b>Agency of the Year</b> is a nasty card game

counteraction cards to face disasters. Or even steal their opponent’s best

more ridiculous with cards that will make them lose everything. And be
eliminated from the game entirely.</span><p></p>

It started out when I asked the youngest, hipster, celebrity-like Executive

Malaysia – <b><i><b>“</b></i></b><i style=""font-weight: bold;"">What will happen if the client

""Assemble your best talents; fight others with the most
disturbing, insincere ways and ridiculous betrayals to win that new business
pitch""

Agency of the Year is a nasty card game
based on the mad world of advertising. Powered by cheap blow tactics and sometimes,
irrational minds.

Players assemble their best talents and despicable
action tactic cards to take down opponents.
The deck also gears them up with
counteraction cards to face disasters. Or even steal their opponent’s best
talents. All for the sake of winning project cards from clients. The game gets
more ridiculous with cards that will make them lose everything. And be
eliminated from the game entirely.

BE CAUTIOUS, THIS GAME IS NOT FOR THE WEAK-WILLED.
Keep the betrayal and backstabbing alive,AOTY Team













The idiot behind Agency of the Year is Shah Al Zefflee, an ex-suit. Supported by a team of graphic designers and
visualisers; Gaik Teng, Juin Yip, Wai Lap, Lim and Candise. We were excited to break our normal work routine to passionately develop this card game, for our love towards the Advertising industry.





We created this game because we thought
that these nasty tactics were probably the reasons behind the failure in
securing new businesses. This was put together on Indiegogo because we can’t do
this alone. We need you, to be our helping hand. To make things happen. 
Now, let’s rock and roll.
P/s:
We love eating fried chicken with mayonnaise.






The Nonsense Story


The idea of Agency of the Year started when ""the snow
glows white on the mountain tonight. Not a footprint to be seen. A kingdom of isolation
and it looks like I'm the Queen"". No, I am just kidding; clearly, that was just a reference from Frozen. Okay, time to be serious. 

It started out when I asked the youngest, hipster, celebrity-like Executive
Creative Director of an international advertising agency based in Kuala Lumpur,
Malaysia – “What will happen if the client
doesn't buy your ideas during the pitch?”. He simply said, “Nothing serious will happen. Just move on.” 


Fuck no; his answer was not satisfying at all. 
After sleepless
nights, nagging other halves, cups of cola, infinite cholesterol and fat
intakes; here we are. A fully developed card game, designed with ridiculous
reasons to satisfy our curiosities.Of course, there were countless arguments among the designers to prove whose
illustration was better – and I was the referee. It was fun; not the fight, but in terms of the whole process. 
THE STRUGGLE WAS REAL – we wanted players to be at
loggerheads during the game, in a casual manner without trying too hard. We tried 1001 ways to translate betrayal and insincere feelings into visuals.
Observing human behaviours for hours, practising sarcastic remarks and jokes; and
used them against our friends – secretly translating their reactions into our
visuals.

<p>We'll make everyone who reads this a deal, if we get <u><strong>1 million real people to subscribe</strong></u> or buy a perk before January 30th, 2019, we will do one standalone game where only those that subscribed or bought a perk through our Indiegogo crowd funding page can participate. <u><strong>And yes, there will be PRIZES!</strong></u></p>
<p>Excited yet? Well get ready because on the 20th of January 2019 we are going to make an announcement that will blow your socks off!!! This announcement will only be sent to our backers and people that have signed up to participate in these programs before the 20th of January. We will reveal it to everyone else on the 30th of January 2019.</p>
<p>If these programs are successful, in the future we will take the 3 contestants with the highest score and fly them to our studio to participate in a live game show that will be just like the ones on television but streamed live on the internet. Want to win up to $1,000,000 in front of a live studio audience and millions of viewers online? Well don't answer yet because boy do we have a plot twist. Ask yourself how could these people make these programs anymore rewarding then up to $175,000 a day and up to $1,000,000 a week in prizes? Well, if we reach our goal, we will reveal this plot twist in an email to all our backers the day after our campaign ends.</p>
<p>For our backers who bought a perk that allows you to participate in the live testing of our programs, we anticipate running the first test game in March and the standalone live game show, with prizes, in early April.</p>
<p>We are going to apologize up front. We could put up video's of all the program's we've designed but we can't because you know one of these big companies that we tried to contact, who never saw our programs, wouldn't take our calls, ignored our emails, letters and tweets might try to steal our design. Now we can't have that can we?</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>You've probably noticed by now that we are only looking to raise $10,000. We know no one on this site believes this type of program can be done for that amount of money. Well you're correct. We decided that if you, the backers believe these programs are worthy, we will raise more then enough. The more we raise, the faster we can bring all 9 games to the public. That's why we offered perks that include an invitation to a live testing of the games, exclusive access to play the first game and cool T-Shirts and Hats. We also wanted to provide a perk that would help businesses and most of the people using this site to raise money for their projects. So we created a perk where for $1,000 and above, you or your business could reach up to 10 million consumers with an ad in our after game email that the consumer will open. So you, or if you know a business that you think might want to place an ad in our after game email, please spread the word. But we are willing to help those on Indiegogo that can't afford the $1,000 perk. If you have an idea that would benefit both of our projects, lets talk.</p>
<p>All perks include a signed letter and your name listed on the game show site. </p>

<h3>The Games</h3>
<p>Here's a brief description of 3 of the programs we have designed.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1545322635/radokxfna3zsd8ntmt73.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Ever play the old game Hangman? Well we've taken that great game and turned it into a live interactive game show. Each Winning With Words game show will have 30 puzzles. Players will have one minute to solve each puzzle. At the start of each puzzle clickable letters will show up at the bottom of the players device and a solve button. At any time during the selection of letters a player can click the solve button. Players will receive a bonus for each letter selected after clicking the solve button. After clicking the solve button players must solve the puzzle by spelling the word/phrase correctly or get zero points.</p>
<p>When the first puzzle starts, players will be provided with a hint to help solve it. Players will start selecting letters, but they can only select 5 incorrect letters that are not part of the puzzle. After the 5th wrong letter is clicked, the player must solve the puzzle, spelling it correctly, or get zero points.</p>
<p><u><strong>This applies to all of our games.</strong></u> Each day, the player with the highest score will win the grand prize of up to $100,000. The winners of the random drawings of up to $25,000 will be selected from all players that finished the game show. The weekly grand prize of up to $1,000,000 will only be given away if their are enough players during each game week to support such a prize. The player with the highest score at the end of the week will win the weekly grand prize of up to $1,000,000. Once we start streaming the live game show, the 3 players with the highest scores and 3 guests will be brought to our studio at our expense to compete for the weekly grand prize of up to $1,000,000. There will be prizes for the other 2 contestants. What are they? Well you'll just have to wait and see.</p>
<p>This game will be played live on the internet starting at 9 pm eastern time every night.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1545322659/fymfelyzvc06n7l5xqpw.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>3 players will be joined together live on the internet to go head to head against each other in the Ace's High game. At the start of each puzzle, 13 cards will show up on the players screens. One at a time each player will select a card until someone selects the ace. This will go on for 30 puzzles. But what if no one selects the Ace? Well, guess you'll just have to play to find out!</p>
<p>This game will be available to play 24 hours a day and can be played as many times as you want.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1545322686/oqs9pv5kb5sfbkapw4eu.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>2 Players will be paired up live online. There will be 30 card battles per program. Both players will be dealt 13 cards, 2 through ace. The 2 players will select a card at the same time, the player with the highest card wins. But to win the card battle one player must win 3 out of the 5. What if no one gets to 3 wins? All we're going to say for now, good luck!</p>

You can decrease your amount of stress with the energy drinks in the market which you can find in the town center if you want to stay more in the town. Don't forget, everyone has the same amount of stress and the others will come here too when they want to stay in the town more.  The weapons which you took from houses have limited ammunition, so be careful. When you enter the town center you can find ammo in the Ludolph Police Center's arsenal. There are no other arsenal or any place you can find ammo so inside and outside of the police center will be dangerous.  There is also a health clinic in the town center so you can heal yourself in there.

<h3>Hi Dear Dog Lovers,</h3>
<p>My name is Frodo Zhang, I started developing Puppy Pipy during the Covid-19 pandemic lock down. This game started from an idea: If a puppy separate from his/her owner, what kind of tough journey he/she will have until they unite again?</p>
<p>Base on this question, the first idea came up from my mind is about food, what will the poor wondering puppy eating? What happen after eating the rotten or expired food from junkyard?</p>
<p>My answer is the puppy learns how to use poop to attack enemies. So the first skill is Puppy Poop, just like bomb in The Legend of Zelda. After that I decided the category of this game, a puzzle platformer, name from my dog, Pipy, but the species are different, Pipy in game is a 6 weeks-old golden retriever puppy.</p>
<p>Since I was graduated from Mechanical Engineering, I wish this game can pass sense of accomplishment and joy after solve the real physical puzzle to player, the early puzzles are Chain Reaction-type Machine , including Domino-like or self made rolling ball chain reaction puzzle in room that have video on Youtube. This will be the core gameplay of chapter one.</p>
<p>Except Chain Reaction, each stage focuses on a specific physical property as its core gameplay, such as gravity, bounce, rotation, fluid, and lift.</p>
<p>This game has a heartwarming story which is about a 6 week old golden retriever puppy named Pipy looking for his young master.</p>
<p><strong>*We will donate part of profits to animal shelters.</strong></p>

</div></div>","Short Summary 
Hi! I am Chastity VonFae, a pole dancer and aerialist here in Baltimore. 
I have often noticed, and you may have as well, a distinct lack of the proper ambiance for gaming in strip clubs and burlesque venues. And games, much as I love them, have an equally distinct lack of sexy dancing and/or fully stocked bar. Let’s fix it with money!
We’re planning for Friday, September 25th, Comic Con weekend, and we'll be at an undetermined location!   The Event It's called High Rollers because we're going for a classy casino-styled event, except with games you care about and performances relevant to your interests. 



Instead of house games, there are games of Cards Against Humanity and Munchkin, where you donate to charity to enter, and get prizes from Third Eye Comics, and Geppi's gift shop when you win!


We will have open gaming space, with reserved tables for backers only.

We have a varied line-up: belly dance, pole dancing, aerial ribbons and classic burlesque acts. 
The performance and the gaming will be on different floors, so you could spend your entire evening with just one or the other, or mix it up however you please.
Lady gamers, we would never forget you (we are you!). If women aren’t your thing, we have got you covered! We’ll have at least two gentleman dancers for you to lure over with dollars to bring luck to your game. (When they're not performing, of course. Can you say Sexy Loki without getting the vapors? Cause I sure can’t.)

This is a by-gamers-for-gamers event, though non-gamers are welcome! There is no shortage of things to see and do, in an environment that is fun, classy, and made for fans of pop culture.
What We Need & What You Get
Our base goal is $3,500. Of that, $2,000 is for the venue and bar, $1100 covers performers and DJs, and $400 covers perks and crowdfunding fees. This is the *bare minimum* we need to make it happen, which is why this is a all-or-nothing (fixed funding) campaign.  If we don't reach our goal, we can't do it.  Everything will be refunded, and the event doesn't happen. But we can reach that goal with just 125 people, so get the word out! 
Our primary perk for backers is advance admission. You get to come play with us and enjoy the show, the fun and the location. Yay! You also get a guaranteed spot, and some perks include table reservations, for varying times and numbers of people. There will be a limit on attendees, so be sure to get a spot for your favorite party people. 
Once we hit that goal, we are in glorious stretch goal territory. A better bar, an arcade, more costumes, more performances, perk boosts, refreshments, we have SO MANY great ideas to make this an awesome time that you'll be talking about for years to come. 
And if this is a *big* success, we'll do it again! Any overage that isn't used to improve the event or perks will go towards reserving the museum for next year.   The Impact Paying tribute to my beloved games and films in my performances is one of my favorite things to do. Unfortunately, my audiences rarely share my interests enough to recognize me, so I don't get to put on shows that I really want to share. I'm not alone in this; all of the dancers staffing this event are really excited about a themed night with guests who will actually recognize their costumes.

We're are blessed with a wide network of talented entertainers here in Baltimore, so if our performers or DJs need a substitute, we are covered.   Other Ways You Can Help Maybe you can't contribute, and that's cool; we get that.  But you can still help by getting the word out. Indiegogo has a bunch of share tools over there, or just pass it on to someone you know would enjoy this event. 
We are really hoping to get this event off the ground, so we hope you’ll sign up early, and throw in a little extra magic if you can, just so we can all say this happened.

Can't wait to see you there. :)

just simple fun sources, but they should be pieces of art. This 
game is based on the key features that I value most: theme, atmosphere, 
scenario, characters, decision making, and unique gameplay elements.</p><p>Our main character is a simple puppeteer who wanders between towns and cities to make a living. One day he performs a show about some poor 
children who steal a delicious looking cake, but they are beaten to death by guards. Surprisingly, what happens in his show while he 
performs, happens right in front of the audience as well. That day 
our main character, the puppeteer, gains the power of controlling people
 from his shadow theater stage.</p><p>The following events after this 
intro will be processed in a realistic and logical way. The puppeteer is 
neither a defender of justice nor bringer of pain and destruction. 
Within the unjust kingdom that he lives in, he will (or maybe will not)
 discover his own soul through the temptation of power and benefits, while experiencing the elements of human nature.</p><p><b>Main features:<br/></b></p><ul>
<li>Unique shadow play theme and scenario<br/>
</li>
<li>8  types of units, 3 types of towers, 3 types of buildings &amp; 1 castle, 6 types of skills/tools, 5 types of buildings which can be captured, and more than 200 upgrades<br/>
</li>
<li>Unique gameplay: Strategy, simulated combat and action combination<br/>
</li>
<li>Indirect decision making system via short shadow play shows<br/>
</li>
<li>Dynamic change between shadow play and cartoonish graphics<br/>
</li>
<li>Cross platform multiplayer available</li>
</ul><p>Making this detailed strategy game and not making a multi player 
gameplay would be shameful. So we did that too. It is currently working.<br/></p><p><b>Why don't you share a demo if the game is working?<br/></b></p><p>Approaching this kind of development starting with multi player mode is our design choice and our free testing server has room for only 20 people. This kind of strategy game requires a complete AI for proper experience. In the trailer you see a multi player match. Also there are missing animations and sounds, which we will make them with the funding. We can avoid them in the trailer but players would probably irritated by them in a demo edition.<br/></p><p><b>1) Main Strategy Gameplay:</b></p><p>Basically there are 3 main lanes that the player utilizes. Players can capture buildings, build buildings, train units, and use battle
 tools/skills. Depending on the territories, the scene becomes shady or 
colorful. Shades represents the puppeteer's area for he controls his 
army from his shadow play stage. You need to build and upgrade certain buildings to train squads. They all have unique skills which would vary the strategy. For example your Camel Riders can pass through the melee soldiers if they see an Archer or Catapult. But if there is a Spearman, Camel Riders cannot reach the ranged units.<br/></p><p>One of the most important factors in this kind of game is distance. Distance affects almost everything in the game. The winning side is always disadvantaged by the distance. For example when player fires the Great Ballista, the cooldown will not start until the arrow hits the target, so the losing side will be able to use them more frequently. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1409143/files/20150423090528-screenshot8.png?1429805128"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p>Buildings which can be captured give bonuses to players. Like increased income, damage, etc. Players can build markets, camps and towers on lanes. Markets give extra income as player builds it farther away from his/her castle. Camps are for garrisoning squads. Towers are for holding armies.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1316466/files/20150322191636-2.jpg?1427076996"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>There are over 200 upgrades in total for most of the things in the game.

When you click on your castle, this screen appears.<br/></p><p></p><p></p><p><b>2) Mini Shadow Theatre Shows:<br/></b></p><p>Mini
 shows are basically mini games with no close relation to the main 
story. They are the indirect decision making mechanism of the game and 
they will affect the game scenario. This will be another unique feature 
of the game. There will also be direct decisions, which will be chosen 
by the puppeteer himself.</p><p></p><p>The player have these options which will affect the main scenario indirectly:</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1304131/files/20150317203035-ss4.png?1426649435"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>

Each face is a pentagon, a five-sided shape. The Roman dodecahedra are also embellished with a series of knobs on each corner point of the pentagons, and the pentagon faces in most cases contain circular holes in them.  More than 200 years after they were first discovered, researchers are no closer to understanding the origin and function of this mysterious object.The Roman dodecahedra date from the 2nd or 3rd centuries AD, and typicall range from 4cm to 11cm in size. To date, more than one hundred of these artifacts have been found across Great Britain, Belgium, Germany, France, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Austria, Switzerland, and Hungary. The great mystery is: how do they work and what do they do? Unfortunately, there is no documentation or notes about them from the time of their creation, so the function of these dodecahedra has not been determined. Nevertheless, many theories and speculations have been put forward over the centuries: candlestick holders (wax was found inside one example), dice, survey instruments, devices for determining the optimal sowing date for winter grain, gauges to calibrate water pipes or standard army bases, staff or scepter decorations, a toy to throw and catch on a stick, or simply a geometric sculpture.Another unproven theory claims that the dodecahedra are religious relics, once used as sacred tools for the druids of Britannia and Caledonia.

Some sources suggest they were the central objects in a bowl game similar to that of our days, with these artifacts used as markers and the players throwing stones to land them in the holes within the dodecahedra.Despite the many unanswered questions, one thing is certain, the Roman dodecahedra were highly valued by their owners.  This is evidenced by the fact that a number of them were found among treasure hoards, among coins and other valuable items.  We may never know the true purpose of the Roman dodecahedra, but we can only hope that advances in archaeology will unearth more clues that will help solve this ancient enigma.http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2011/06/10/dodecahedrons-purpose-remains-mystery.htmlhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_dodecahedronhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodecahedronhttp://dodecahedral.com   MEDIA support  What We Need & What You GetWe made idea, game playing rules, original icon design, full promotional kit, web presentation, prototype and need your help to finish it.We need to reach 5.000US$ or more in funding for making mould and first line of manufacture.Making mould for mass production is complicated and expencive more than 2.000US$.

</div></div>","Short Summary Hi, I'm Rudy and I'm an indie developer. That's right, there's no company, just me. My primary platform is Android and I have a few apps & games (~20) in Google Play. 
I have plenty of satisfied users, but some of them have switched to iOS. They're looking for apps they used to love on Android, but sadly - there's nothing to be found. And that's where you come in - to fill the emptiness inside their (and your) soul. First app that I'm going to port is Currency Converter!




Why Curency Converter?

Paid version has rating 4.7 / 5, free version (with ADs) has rating 4.5 / 5. So the users love the app (even more than other currency converters from big companies)
It has been on Google Play since 2009, yet still more and more users download it daily.
You can have up to 15 different currencies on screen at the same time.

Conversion is super-easy, it takes place just as you type the numbers.
Has historical graphs, built-in calculator, colorful themes and works offline.
Support for phones, tablets and Android wear.
You can add your own custom currency, my personal favorite is ""beer currency"" - just enter how much one beer costs in your favorite pub and when it's time to go home - you see exactly how much you have to pay :)
   


What users say?

Easy to use and very useful.

Great real-time currency app. The ability to customize the interface is a great benefit. Very smooth and intuitive app.

Easy Life. A life is easier with this golden app from Android. ""Wonderful job, people.""

Love it. Always fast easy and accurate with multiple currency conversion at the same time great app.

Excellently easy to use nice app. Simple and attractive design. Congrats.

Excellent for travel. Fast, simple, easy! Great for travelers to get quick conversions without the complexity and can be used offline.

Great. This does what is says very well with a nice style and a practical user interface. The developer listens to comments and implements improvements.




Ok, one more screenshot to convince you :)



What I Need & What You'll Get
$1500 should cover:



Mac mini - 799.00 € (I'm based in EU, so the prices are in €)

iPhone 5s - 389.00 € 
Developer account - 99 €

Stretch goals:


$2000 - I'll implement tablet layouts for the app

$2500 - I'll develop a watch extension, too
$4500 - Better equipment equals faster development - I'll work my a** off to bring the app sooner



Simply put -  I'll buy the hardware needed to develop & publish an iOS app. Oh yes, that's it. I don't need funds for marketing, PR, design and other fancy stuff. That part is solved already, because demand is there. 



But I don't want it for free. Nah, that would be selfish (or plain stealing - based on the point of view). Each perk has something small or bigger waiting for you, too. Be it a promo code for the finished app, extra promo codes for Android apps including Interval Timer 4 HIIT Workout+, New Interval Timer, Plumber Reloaded ADFree or Currency Converter+, source codes of my Android games or your own product placement screen in the app - you choose. The most generous backer will own the rights to the source code of this app! After I'm done developing it and the app is published, of course.


So check out the perks and pick the one you love the most!



Perks you might consider


Co-worker - this person will get the source code of finished and published app and he will be listed as my personal hero in ""thank you"" screen.

All eyes on me -  your company logo / face / mascot as a splash screen in finished app.


This bank of mine - I'll implement your selected bank's exchange rate list (if the bank provides such a list - most central banks do) + you'll be listed as the banker in ""thank you"" screen.

Risks & Challenges
As an indie developer, challenge is all I do. Every day brings a new challenge. But if you take a look at my portfolio (@halmi.sk), you'll notice that I'm a pretty universal developer. I made apps for Android, Windows phone and even one iOS game in the past. Sure, times have changed, but I believe I can do this. And so do you, otherwise you wouldn't read this far ;)

I've set up this campaign as a fixed campaign, so I think there's no risk for you as a backer. If I don't reach the target goal, you'll be fully refunded. If I do, I'm experienced enough to make this real. And you can gain some neat perks in the process.
   Other Ways You Can Help Maybe you cannot pledge any money and that's fine. But you certainly do have some friends and you can tell them about this campaign. So please do so. Share this campaign if you like it. If you don't - tell me. I'll do my best to fix it and make it more appealing to all of you. Use the share buttons directly on IndieGoGo ;)",4.0,2,"1 Campaign

Throughout each battle each side has a few tactical calls to give new orders to their marshals from the top down view. Attacker wins if he kills all the enemy marshals or captures the throne in a given time limit. Defender wins if he kills all the enemy marshals or survive the time limit.

As it stands now, the game is functional, but needs more features and components to be great. One risk is tough bugs or roadblocks in a particular feature.

Build interesting vehicles, planes, helicopters, and other whacky contraptions. Design a wrecking ball to smash through a brick wall and cause a chain reaction. Knock down and run over the test dummies (don't worry, they won't mind!). With an ever-growing assortment of blocks and free updates for life, you'll always have something to build and create.You can consider this a mix of Besiege and Trailmakers, with some other aspects and components not found in either. Quickly create a vehicle by simply snapping blocks together in the WYSIWYG editor. Add a frame, power source, mechanical parts, and you're in business. Add as many parts as you want. Or, as many as your machine can handle (more on that below).  Not everyone has a high-end machine. And sometimes, with complex simulations (when you want to drop 1,000 wrecking balls on our poor test dummies) the simulation can get bogged down. SandBlox comes with easy-to-toggle settings and sliders to adjust performance and quality (both visual and physics accuracy). Simply turn off shadows, adjust physics substeps and iterations, and even pixelate the entire game.Every campaign begs an important question, why crowdfund? As a solo developer, every bit helps and directly impacts the game's progress. Your donations will allow me to treat this as a job, which will ultimately get the game done far faster than finding off hours to do so as a hobby. Some of the assets are easy to make, like a cube and the wrecking ball. But there's a certain limit where an actual artist should step in. I've already gone and commissioned our test dummy from a skilled low poly artist. A good portion of donations will go towards quality 3d models for the game. I also have an audio engineer ready to get started on unique SFX and music.Like the majority of indie devs, I'm the sole developer. As you may have read above, this is one of the reasons crowdfunding will greatly help me to complete this game. There's no large cut going to overhead on a game studio, or even paying a small team. But being a solo dev shouldn't be seen as a bad thing in and of itself. There's some great aspects to it. Of course, all decisions are made immediately, which speeds up that part of production. But what you get is a handcrafted product at the end of it. Each line of code was put there by me, and I know exactly how the game fits together as a composition. I've also been making simulations for 7 years now, and it's something I'm passionate about. I'm making this game because I want to play it, too.I can foresee a few challenges in this, but none that worry me. As it stands now, the game is functional, but needs more features and components to be great. One risk is tough bugs or roadblocks in a particular feature. For example, if I was setting up the calculations for realistic rocket propulsion. Sure, rockets are simple enough, but implementing them in a specific way might prove challenging, and there's a risk that that feature is not possible, or not easy to add. Crowdfunding will also be used to solve the unsolvable. In the past, I hired one-time consultation from a mathematician to get a terrain generator algorithm exactly how I wanted.

my game something much better than what I aspired to at the beginning.A reward that I offer to all the people who entered my campaign is a sincere thank you, because your attention also has a significant value for me.For those who donate a support for this campaign will receive exclusive shorts of the game, as well as images and songs included in the game, also include a personalized video where Jeff deeply thanks them for helping the campaign.If I did not achieve the goal, I would still feel happy because I know it is a small start to unleash my project and I would take the funds to take courses to continue acquiring more knowledge of programming and music production to make my game something much better .As in everything, my campaign is not without risks, my main obstacle is the time, because I'm studying a degree many times it is difficult to continue my game, so I try to use those lapses free of time to continue with my Project and progress more and more to its end.When you want to do something well it takes time, under that phrase I continue my game, and I know that one day I will see it realized.As I mentioned money is not the only contribution they can make, it would greatly help my campaign by spreading it, sharing it and letting others know about my project, it is very easy for an idea to be lost in the vastness of the internet, but with its help My project will be able to reach more ears.Thank you for all your attention.Sincerely yours: Josías Álvarez García  Hola, me llamo Josías.Desde siempre me han gustado los videojuegos, un día quise adentrarme más a este fantástico y comencé a aprender acerca del mundo de la programación, tenía muchas ideas que al unirlas, dieron como resultado mi proyecto más grande: Snowball wars.Desde ese momento, crear un videojuego y poder ver como los demás lo disfrutan se convirtió en una meta de vida.Snowball wars en un juego de plataforma, en donde nuestro protagonista, un niño de 10 años llamado Jeff debe salvar su dimensión del colapso, debido a que el cristal que mantenía el orden fue robado por un enemigo, quien se dedica hurtar estos cristales con el objetivo de obtener suficiente poder para controlar todas las dimensiones.Jeff no contento con la situación decide ir por este nefasto enemigo, en su aventura es transportado a otras dimensiones, las cuales debe atravesar para llegar a Django, recuperar el cristal y salvar su dimensión... junto con las otras dimensiones.Si deciden donar a mi causa les estaré profundamente agradecido, si no lo hacen, lo estaré igual, porque sé que al menos se dieron el tiempo de conocer mi juego, y eso es valioso para mí.Para mi campaña necesito de 3000 USD, necesito comprar la licencia de algunos programas, así como darles una contribución a aquellos que me ayudaron con este gran proyecto que estoy llevando a cabo.Así como para poder tomar cursos de programación avanzada y poder hacer de mi juego algo mucho mejor a lo que aspiré al principio.Una recompensa que ofrezco a todas las personas que ingresaron a mi campaña es un sincero gracias, porque su atención también tiene un valor significativo para mi.Para aquellos que donen un apoyo para esta campaña recibirán cortos exclusivos del juego, así como imágenes y canciones incluidas en el juego, así mismo incluiré un video personalizado en donde Jeff les agradece profundamente por ayudar a la campaña.Si no lograra la meta, aún me sentiría feliz, porque sé que es un pequeño comienzo para dar rienda suelta a mi proyecto y ocuparía los fondos para tomar cursos para seguir adquiriendo más conocimiento de programación y producción de música para hacer mi juego algo mucho mejor. Como en todo, mi campaña no está excénta de riesgos, mi principal obstaculo es el tiempo, debido a que estoy estudiando una licenciatura muchas veces me es difícil continuar con mi juego, por eso trato de usar esos lapsos libres de tiempo para continuar con mi proyecto y avanzar cada vez más a su final.Cuando se quiere hacer algo bien lleva tiempo, bajo esa frase yo continuo mi juego, y sé que un día lo veré realizado. Como ya mencioné el dinero no es la única contribución que pueden hacer, ayudarían mucho a mi campaña difundiéndola, compartiéndola y haciéndole saber a los demás de mi proyecto, es muy fácil que una idea se pierda en la inmensidad del internet, pero con su ayuda mi proyecto podrá llegar a mas oídos.Gracias por toda su atención.Atentamente: Josías Álvarez García",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

My goal is to bring them what they have always asked for, a tank game both realistic, fun, and historical.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The goal with this funding is for a demo of the game, once we get a demo going we can expand and become self sufficient, bringing the community more tanks they love. Contributors will receive a demo of the game to play with us on the demo release date, you will also receive increased earnings of the in-game currency for the official release. If our goal is not reached we will still try to bring the game to fruition even if it comes out of our pockets. However we ask you to please help us bring this game to you. Any help we receive will allow to game to come faster and at higher quality!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>How does this effect you?</h3>
<p>Why do you care? There are plenty of other tank games right? How is this different? Well I will tell you what is different. This game is created by volunteers who have a passion for history and tanks, not a profit driven company that treats history second rate. Tanks from similar eras will fight tanks of similar eras.We listen to the concerns of the community and will try our best to implement mechanics that most players are comfortable with. The game is not meant to be grindy or frustrating. This game is not mean to force your hand deep into your pockets. Why help? Why not! Receiving the benefit of increased earnings and being able to play the demo will be a fun time you will never forget.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>We face the challenge of being a small company of volunteers. We cannot pump out assets at the rate of million dollar companies. Which is precisely why we need help. Most of our problems such as tanks physics and server space can be solved with funding. Armor and ballistic mechanics will require much research but we can do it.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Spread the word. Even a $5.00 helps if many people are in on it! We try our hardest to bring this game to you. Our volunteers and staff thank you for your eagerness for Conflict Attrition.</p>

<p>ServerTycoon is a Construction, Strategic and Management Video Game where players have to manage a Datacenter and earn game coins offering services to their customers.</p>
<p>Your company can be listed on the ServerTycoon Stock Exchange and players can buy shares from other friendly or competitor companies and take profits, but remember pirates and competitors will try to stop you with frequent cyber attacks so, manage and improve your systems, organise your defences and try to climb the top of the hi-tech finance!</p>
<p>Your will also play seasonal Quests. You can create a party and face challenges and riddles. Try to solve quests with your skills ...and discover what's in the  Server Tycoon Cyberbox.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1552575870/vfiyqwwlwkhm7mtbcgh6.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Starter Kit</h3>
<p>When the game starts we give you all you need to start earning game coins with your virtual company:</p>
<ul>
<li>your company building on one random street of The Valley</li>
<li>an entry-level server (you can upgrade it as soon as you have earned enough money...)</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1552584588/dhfbdgxgkwrkzp9c2tci.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>The Server</h3>
<p>The Server is the main actor of the game's scene. You can buy custom components to assemble a powerful machine capable to gain coins at higher speed and resist to cyber attacks on time.</p>
<h3>Services + Time = Coins</h3>
<p>When you install a server and switch it on it starts offering services to your customers immediately.</p>
<p>This generates coins that are kept into the server itself until you move them into your Vault.</p>
<p>If an attack succeed all coins contained into a server could be stolen!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.servertycoon.com/indiegogo/cons_animation_final.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>The Vault</h3>
<p>The Vault is a special server aimed to host your coins and keep them safe from most common cyber attacks. It’s a kind of hardware wallet...</p>
<p>Upgrade it to store more and more coins and to resist to newest and hardest attacks techniques.</p>
<p>In ServerTycoon, coins are not transferred from people (your customers) to service providers (you) through bank institutes. They are a kind of cryptocurrency generated directly into the server that offers a service.</p>
<p>In other words coins are special files that can physically travel via internet, and that's the reason why cyber pirates want to attack you at all time...</p>
<h3>Multiplayer</h3>
<p>Everyone, no matter which platform you use, will be able to play against (or together) all other players in a consistent massive multiplayer world.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1552576759/noowjhmc3hoshckiqnds.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

Needless to say, the more ServerTycoon is funded the more resources we will put in the project and so anticipate the releases dates.</i></p><h3>""The best defense is a good offense""</h3><p>As mentioned above, pirates will pass their time attacking you, but as soon as they do it, something remains on your server..:</p><ul>
<li>
<strong>the footprint</strong> (the network address): if the stolen coins have been already moved in the attacking server you can try to rescue them, or even just revenge... next time he will remember of you ;)</li>
<li>
<strong>the script used for the attack</strong>: use it to understand what was wrong with your defence script, why the attacker ones is more efficient than yours and be prepared to learn new defence techniques</li>
<li>
<strong>a temporary protection against further attacks coming from that address</strong>: your firewall will automatically blacklist the attacking address for a short period, restore your server before this basic protection expires!</li>
</ul><p>Attacks and defenses are both based on Corewars scripts made of few instructions you can learn in minutes. When starting ServerTycoon a tutorial will teach you the basics of this art. Initially there will be two basic scripts included in you firewall.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.servertycoon.com/indiegogo/asm_animation_final.gif"" src=""""/></p><h3>Your Staff</h3><p>As soon as you have earned enough game coins, you can hire your first technician from the Employment Agency, send them to IT Trainings to improve their skills and be able to reduce systems setup and technical interventions time.

Your company can be listed on the ServerTycoon Stock Exchange and players can buy shares from other friendly or competitor companies and take profits, but remember pirates and competitors will try to stop you with frequent cyber attacks so, manage and improve your systems, organise your defences and try to climb the top of the hi-tech finance!
Your will also play seasonal Quests. You can create a party and face challenges and riddles. Try to solve quests with your skills ...and discover what's in the  Server Tycoon Cyberbox.

Starter Kit
When the game starts we give you all you need to start earning game coins with your virtual company:

your company building on one random street of The Valley
an entry-level server (you can upgrade it as soon as you have earned enough money...)


The Server
The Server is the main actor of the game's scene. You can buy custom components to assemble a powerful machine capable to gain coins at higher speed and resist to cyber attacks on time.
Services + Time = Coins
When you install a server and switch it on it starts offering services to your customers immediately.
This generates coins that are kept into the server itself until you move them into your Vault.
If an attack succeed all coins contained into a server could be stolen!

The Vault
The Vault is a special server aimed to host your coins and keep them safe from most common cyber attacks. It’s a kind of hardware wallet...
Upgrade it to store more and more coins and to resist to newest and hardest attacks techniques.
In ServerTycoon, coins are not transferred from people (your customers) to service providers (you) through bank institutes. They are a kind of cryptocurrency generated directly into the server that offers a service.
In other words coins are special files that can physically travel via internet, and that's the reason why cyber pirates want to attack you at all time...
Multiplayer
Everyone, no matter which platform you use, will be able to play against (or together) all other players in a consistent massive multiplayer world.

ServerTycoon will be downloadable for everyone with a short tutorial to play. However, to play the full game and unlock all features you will need an account:
Standard Account
To play ServerTycoon you need an account. The Standard Account will be sold at 14.99 EUR and with it you will have all the game's features unlocked and ready to play.
Creator Account
We believe the Game will be awesome and we love it but for whom who wants to play an additional exclusive game feature we created the Creator Mode.
The Creator Account unlocks, in addition to all of them already included in the Standard one, an additional feature. You will access to an easy-to-use and effective tool that will let you design your own Datacenter, define custom hardware and sell it in the in-game Store for all other players. The Creator Account will be sold at 29.99 EUR.
Funder Account
To those who help us in this campaign, we are offering an additional exclusive perk. You'll benefit of a starting 50% lifetime discount in the in-game store. Discount percentage increases on a pledge basis according to the following values: 40€/50%, 99€/75%.  You will be also invited to define an hardware (name, tech spec and aspect) that will be released with the game.  The Funder Account will not be offered for sale. It is an exclusive perk limited to the crowdfunding campaign.

Should the campaign be successful, ServerTycoon will be available by the end of Q4-2019, for PC Windows, MacOS and GNU/Linux with the following game features:

Grown and manage your server farm
Hardware purchasing and management
Comply with Contracts to earn Coins
Cyber Attack and Defence system
Network cables Management
Disruptions (flooding/cooling and power failures, network down, etc.)
Complete Seasonal Quests to receive exclusive rewards and unlock Achievements
Hire skilled technicians to unlock new technologies
Play Third Person and First Person View modes


 Moreover, we planned to release the following additional features by the end of Q1-2020:

Anti fire and HVAC (heat, ventilation and air conditioning) management
Buy and Sell Company Shares in the internal Stock Market
Sell your buildings to buy bigger ones

Please note that our estimations are based on our current team and the ability to put effort in the project. Needless to say, the more ServerTycoon is funded the more resources we will put in the project and so anticipate the releases dates.""The best defense is a good offense""As mentioned above, pirates will pass their time attacking you, but as soon as they do it, something remains on your server..:

the footprint (the network address): if the stolen coins have been already moved in the attacking server you can try to rescue them, or even just revenge... next time he will remember of you ;)

the script used for the attack: use it to understand what was wrong with your defence script, why the attacker ones is more efficient than yours and be prepared to learn new defence techniques

a temporary protection against further attacks coming from that address: your firewall will automatically blacklist the attacking address for a short period, restore your server before this basic protection expires!
Attacks and defenses are both based on Corewars scripts made of few instructions you can learn in minutes. When starting ServerTycoon a tutorial will teach you the basics of this art. Initially there will be two basic scripts included in you firewall.Your StaffAs soon as you have earned enough game coins, you can hire your first technician from the Employment Agency, send them to IT Trainings to improve their skills and be able to reduce systems setup and technical interventions time. Make them become Cyber Security Experts, System Engineers, etc...Manage your staff: hire people, train them, rent their skills, and even fire them!Game quests are released periodically over time. Be sure to complete them all. Here below some examples:

Golden Ages: Retrace the whole history of Datacenter from ENIAC to Supercomputers;

Locks 'n' Gates: Form a party and use your skills to solve logic games or computer trivia to unlock ServerTycoon Cyber Boxes;

Blockchains Apocalypse: Find out new ways to make money using EVERY computational resource. Set up your rig but beware of heat and power consumption;

Subsea Farm: Free cooling... unlimited building space... and also free power! But the down side of the coin are an initial high-cost and not possibility to upgrade or maintenance. Be smart and plan your datacenter successfully;

Singularity: Use Bio-Machines made of tissues and neurons instead of silicon, gold and other metals. This scenario offers you an outlook of a dystopian future but beware... shut down your servers before they will prevail on you!
Please note: the Quests listed above could be subject to minor changes in title and contents.5 € SupportersWe appreciate all the support we can get, even if you cannot afford more.

<p><b>WHY WE CHOSE INDIEGOGO &amp; WHY WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT</b></p>
<p>With your support we can have this game available for download on IOS and Android 2015/2016. The faster we make the game available the better it will be for the pandas. This is an urgent matter! Your contribution is vital for this project to be launched soon. We need you're help! <br/><br/>We chose crowdfunding because we don't want to change our creative freedom with the Hungry Panda Adventure game concept or the donation model. We want to donate up to 90% of the profits to Pandas International. The donation model is the most vital components of the project, we don't want to change it at all! <br/> <br/>There are a lot of people that think that we are a bit crazy. Why would i go to such lengths to see this project through. But what motivates me is that If 10 million people play our free game, for a couple of hours per month over a period of a year. The ad revenue could be around 1.8 million dollars per year, or more. What if this is the future of how you support a cause, by playing free games? My dream is bigger than Hungry Panda Adventure, but this is a test of the concept, if this doesn't get funded, then why bother trying other similar concepts? This is why we need your support! <br/><br/>There are two things that have motivated me to continue. First of all I am grateful to Pandas International for believing in me, the idea and supporting it. Second of all almost everyone that hears about the project loves the concept. If the game was available today, they would download it and play it. We welcome any kind of feedback about the game, the idea or our campaign. Please feel free to comment and hopefully we can improve. <br/><br/>We chose Indiegogo's fixed funding because we need your support to really make this project real. Our dream of helping the pandas should be a common struggle, join us, make this project real by supporting us. Let's save some pandas! <br/><br/>We have invested in developing a simple prototype and mock-ups that are shown in this campaign. By making a prototype it is easier to communicate the game concept when developing the game that will be released. </p>

<p><b>RISKS</b></p>
<p>Game development is a tough business and it's costly to develop good games. Reaching the 100,000 dollars First Release Goal would make it possible to release a stable first version for both IOS and Android. But reaching the main goal of 30,000 or 50,000 goal we are able to start development.<br/><br/>The risks decreases the higher stretch goal we reach. The funding goal that would give us the best chances to save some pandas and of success is the 200,000 Instant Success stretch goal. To deliver both survival mode and story mode, having the game available in several languages and more plattforms it can reach more people and we can save more pandas. <br/><br/>Working with IT projects has it's risks, however since I have worked as an IT-consultant, both project leader and user experience designer for several years and am well aware of many development risks and how to avoid them. We also have outsourcing contacts and teams in Europe that are available to support our development with knowdledge. <br/><br/>The gifts in the perks could be delayed a couple of weeks if the volumes are very high. Everyone will get their gift. It might just take longer before they arrive but we promise that we will work really hard to ship all the goods. Paul from Tensaii in Sweden and Andrea from Pandas International in USA will be doing the shipping. If the campaign is a success we will start the shipping from October. We will do our best to provide the goods in December 2015 and the latest in February 2016. We will keep all the donators updated on the progress. </p>

Our partner Pandas International is a non-profit organisation based in Colorado, USA. Together we proudly present the Hungry Panda Adventure a mainstream puzzle game that will be donating up to 90% of the profits to Pandas International. We need your support to develop this game and make it available worldwide 2015/2016 to help save the Giant pandas from extinction. ""You play a free game, you have fun and you help save some pandas""We invite YOU to support this project and support us in this campaign so that we can develop the Hungry Panda Adventure. Donate, buy a perk, share the campaign on social media, LIKE our Facebook page. Join us and let's save some pandas! Hungry Panda Adventure - LIKE OUR FACEBOOK PAGEShare this Tweet and ask people to retweetWhen buying a perk you will be able to add size, color or goods for the Bronze, Silver, Gold, Diamond and Platinum Perks. Remember If the campaign is not a success you will get a full refund. 
When seeing the Giant panda we can't help falling in love with them. It saddens us that they are endangered and there are less than 2000 Giant pandas left on the planet. There are around 1600 in the wild and 300 in captivity. They really need our help now! 




""Endangered means we have time... Extinction is forever"" - Pandas InternationalThere are several challenges when taking care of pandas, one is economical. Just taking care of one panda costs around 10,000$ each year. Funds are really important to be able to increase the panda population. 

Increasing the panda population, would increase costs and the need for more donations. There are a lot of good people donating funds today and a lot of non-profit organisations that are doing their best to save the pandas. But the situation is far from sustainable. It might never become sustainable, because non-profit organisations are not businesses. They do not focus on making profits and therefore lack a sustainable business model that's why they need funds.OUR PROPOSAL FOR A SOLUTIONWe propose to create a sustainable business model with a separate product. The product being the Hungry Panda Adventure. We chose a game because games reach billions of people and make billions of dollars each year. With big volumes we can make more profits and spread the knowledge about the pandas and their situation. 



WHY WE CHOSE INDIEGOGO & WHY WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT
With your support we can have this game available for download on IOS and Android 2015/2016. The faster we make the game available the better it will be for the pandas. This is an urgent matter! Your contribution is vital for this project to be launched soon. We need you're help! We chose crowdfunding because we don't want to change our creative freedom with the Hungry Panda Adventure game concept or the donation model. We want to donate up to 90% of the profits to Pandas International. The donation model is the most vital components of the project, we don't want to change it at all!  There are a lot of people that think that we are a bit crazy. Why would i go to such lengths to see this project through. But what motivates me is that If 10 million people play our free game, for a couple of hours per month over a period of a year. The ad revenue could be around 1.8 million dollars per year, or more. What if this is the future of how you support a cause, by playing free games? My dream is bigger than Hungry Panda Adventure, but this is a test of the concept, if this doesn't get funded, then why bother trying other similar concepts? This is why we need your support! There are two things that have motivated me to continue. First of all I am grateful to Pandas International for believing in me, the idea and supporting it. Second of all almost everyone that hears about the project loves the concept. If the game was available today, they would download it and play it. We welcome any kind of feedback about the game, the idea or our campaign. Please feel free to comment and hopefully we can improve. We chose Indiegogo's fixed funding because we need your support to really make this project real. Our dream of helping the pandas should be a common struggle, join us, make this project real by supporting us. Let's save some pandas! We have invested in developing a simple prototype and mock-ups that are shown in this campaign. By making a prototype it is easier to communicate the game concept when developing the game that will be released. 
Let's keep our eyes on the prize! Let's work together and let's save some pandas!  

THE HUNGRY PANDA ADVENTURE!The Hungry Panda Adventure will be available for FREE when released. You won't ever need to buy anything in the game with real money. Coins are collected easily in the game! With coins you buy items, buy power ups, boosters and more. The more you play, the higher you can score, collect more coins and help save more pandas! 
HOW TO PLAY The Hungry Panda Adventure is about a really hungry panda. By collecting food tiles you can feed him. But be careful, because you are constantly playing against the clock. When you feed the panda you level up and score more points. While playing the game and collecting food tiles you will receive time bonuses that adds time to the timer.  
You will be able to connect to social media and compete with friends in the scoreboard page. There is a booster wheel that can be spun freely once a day. You will be able to win free boosters daily. Boosters are used to boost one game. 

Your name in the game credits with Bronze, Silver, Gold, Diamond and Platinum perks
Purchasing the Bronze, Silver, Gold, Diamond and Platinum perks will get you onto the Credits page inside the game. It will be in alfabetical order with name, city and country. Platinum Perks will be shown first, then diamond, gold, silver and lastly bronze perks.

By hiring us, we can work on social innovations that can change the world. The Hungry Panda Adventure is our first social entrepreneurial project and far from our last social project. Join us in finding new ways of healing the world. 
""Play a free game, have fun and let's save some pandas""


ABOUT THE PERKSWe have tried to be socially responsible in our perk gifts as well. Most of the gifts are Ecological/Organic and Fairtrade. The Swedish perk gifts with Hungry Panda Adventure print, the bambu pen, cloth bag and t-shirt are provided by Gröna Tryck. The fantastic chocolate is provided by Plantations. When buying a perk you will be able to add size, color or goods for the Bronze, Silver, Gold, Diamond and Platinum Perks.Remember If the campaign is not a success you will get a full refund. The American and Pandas international perk gifts with Pandas International print, the eco magnet, travel coffee mug and t-shirt are provided by Pandas International. To be able to minimize shipping costs for our supporters in different parts of the world. We have some gifts that are shipped from Sweden with cheaper shipping for the European market and some that are shipped from USA for our american supporters. If you don't feel like buying a perk, please donate, even one dollar can make a difference in the end to reach our initial goal of a 30,000 dollars. Please provide the needed contact information so that we will be able to send the wallpaper and perk gifts. Thank you for your support. 























HOW FUNDS FROM THE CAMPAIGN ARE GOING TO BE DISTRIBUTED 
The main campaign of 30,000$ of those funds around 45 - 55% will go to actually developing the game. Around 45% (40-50%) will go to cover merchandise costs in the Perks and 5% are Indiegogo fees.


Reaching 30,000$ or more - Hungry Panda Adventure 
Reaching the main goal of 30,000$ we will have around 15,000$ after campaign costs. This will not cover all of the development costs, but it will cover enough to get started and to develop the Hungry Panda Adventure to a playable BETA version available for IOS. We will have power ups, boosters, combination tiles, and more available in this beta version.    We will keep you posted on our Facebook page so like the Hungry Panda Adventure Facebook page to get updated! Let's save some pandas!
STRETCH GOALS FOR HUNGRY PANDA ADVENTUREReaching the stretch goals means developing a better game, spreading the game more and increasing the chances of saving more pandas. So Let's save some pandas!






















RISKS
Game development is a tough business and it's costly to develop good games. Reaching the 100,000 dollars First Release Goal would make it possible to release a stable first version for both IOS and Android. But reaching the main goal of 30,000 or 50,000 goal we are able to start development.The risks decreases the higher stretch goal we reach. The funding goal that would give us the best chances to save some pandas and of success is the 200,000 Instant Success stretch goal. To deliver both survival mode and story mode, having the game available in several languages and more plattforms it can reach more people and we can save more pandas. Working with IT projects has it's risks, however since I have worked as an IT-consultant, both project leader and user experience designer for several years and am well aware of many development risks and how to avoid them. We also have outsourcing contacts and teams in Europe that are available to support our development with knowdledge. The gifts in the perks could be delayed a couple of weeks if the volumes are very high. Everyone will get their gift. It might just take longer before they arrive but we promise that we will work really hard to ship all the goods. Paul from Tensaii in Sweden and Andrea from Pandas International in USA will be doing the shipping. If the campaign is a success we will start the shipping from October. We will do our best to provide the goods in December 2015 and the latest in February 2016. We will keep all the donators updated on the progress.

<p>Wir, der Airsoft Verein S.I.F.A. und im Namen der Mitglieder sowie des Präsidenten und Vize Präsidenten, möchten euch unsere Idee von einer Airsoft Arena in der Schweiz präsentieren und begeistern können.</p>
<p>Wir stehen für Swiss Indoor Federation of Airsoft und möchten die erste kommerziell und professionell genutzte Airsoft Arena der Schweiz eröffnen.</p>
<p>Die Personen unter euch welche mit dem Mannschafts-Sport schon vertraut sind, wissen wie schwer es heutzutage ist, ein Feld zu bekommen um regelmäßig Spiele zu veranstalten. Einerseits ist es von Gesetzeswegen verunmöglicht oder durch Anwohner oder Besitzer und nicht zuletzt Sicherheitstechnisch bedingt nicht machbar. Darum haben wir uns überlegt, eine Halle zu mieten, eine Faszinierende Map zu entwickeln mir vielen technischen Highlights. So stehen wir in keinem Konflikt mit Gesetzen, Behörden und Anwohner.</p>
<p>Somit werden wir Woche für Woche, Jahr für Jahr euch eine Top Location bieten können zu fairen Konditionen.</p>

<h3>Was passiert bei einer erfolgreichen Finanzierung?</h3>
<div>In erster Linie möchten wir natürlich unser Ziel von 108'000 USD erreichen, sollte aber unser Projekt enormen Andrang finden, so werden wir das Geld natürlich entsprechend besser nutzen können:</div>
<div>- besseres Start-Equipment<br/>- technische Highlights auf dem Spielfeld<br/>- ev. Grössere Spielfelder<br/>- zusätzliches Feld-Material</div>
<div>Somit wird in einem Ersten Schritt die Halle eingemietet. Im nächsten Schritt wird mit eurer Hilfe das Spielfeld geplant, gebaut und getestet.

Nach erfolgreichem Beta Test wird die Geschäftstätigkeit aufgenommen.</div>
<div>Wir rechnen damit, dass wir die Tore ab dem Oktober 2015 öffnen können. Passend zur kalten Jahreszeit.</div>
<div>
<p><i>Primarily, of course, we want to reach our goal of 108,000 USD, but should find our project with enormous, so we will be able to use the money of course correspondingly better:</i></p>

</div>
<div>
<h3>Warum so viel?</h3>
<div>Um euch zu veranschaulichen warum wir einen so hohen Betrag suchen, möchten wir euch einige Eckdaten zur Gemüte führen:</div>
<div>Eine Halle in akzeptabler Größe kostet um die &gt; 2500 CHF / Monat. Damit haben wir eine Spielfläche von rund 2/3 eines Fußballfeldes. Zudem werden die Mietverträge auf mind. 3 Jahre abgeschlossen.</div>
<div>Wie oben beschrieben, umso mehr wir hier rausholen, desto grösser wird die Halle sein und einen besseren Standort kann erzielt werden. Wie jedem bewusst ist, sind Mieten beispielsweise in Zürich höher als im Kt. Aargau.</div>
<div>Natürlich versuchen wir auch Staffelungen und weitere Reduktionen rauszuholen um möglichst kostengünstig eine Arena zu betreiben.</div>
</div>
<br/>
<p>Du siehst, wir haben einiges vor, doch zusammen sind wir stark! Verwirkliche unseren Traum, unsere Idee, unser Vorhaben und sei dabei. Du hilfst, die Zukunft von Airsoft in der Schweiz zu besiegeln!</p>
<p></p>
<p><i>To illustrate to you why we are looking for such a high amount, we would like to bring you some basic data to mind:</i></p>
<p><i>A hall in an acceptable size costs about&gt; 2500 CHF / month. Thus we have a play area of about 2/3 of a football field. In addition, leases are negotiated on min. 3 years.</i></p>
<p><i>As described above, the more we get out here, the greater the hall will be a better location and can be achieved. As everyone is aware, for example, rents in Zurich is higher than in Kt. Aargau.</i></p>
<p><i>Of course, we also try graduations and further reductions rauszuholen to possible cost to operate an arena.</i></p>
<p><i>You see, we have big plans, but together we are strong! Realize our dreams, our ideas, our projects and join in. You are helping to seal the future of airsoft in Switzerland!</i></p>

<p>We are making this game because the sRPG genre needs more love and, more importantly, games under its banner.

Also, anthro characters are a fresh and fun twist style-wise.

into four provinces: Wistal, Furwae, Kapveir, Hopstyn. Peace gave way to
 conflict after those in power unlocked the secrets of magic and grew 
mad with power. Following a period of unjust oppression, the lower class
 finally retaliated which started the peasant revolt as history has 
proclaimed.""  Tails of Tactics is an independent video game being made for Windows, Mac and Linux by Swift Studios. It is a strategy RPG (sRPG) about a tiger-warrior named Yu, who fights in a rebel group seeking to oust the kingdom's corrupted rulers, dubbed ""The Tyrants."" Inspired by games such as Final Fantasy Tactics and Ogre Battle, we will develop this game using the custom Tethical game engine.We are a small team of aficionados who strive to realize this concept and together with your support, we can score another fun title for the sRPG genre.
 


We need $85,000 to cover all of our costs in producing this game which includes contingencies. (A safety net) The project breakdown is as follows:

The lion's share of our listed amount will go towards artists creating all of the game's visuals followed by the programmer putting the game together. We already have our game plan set up and are ready to get started on it after you show us your interest by getting involved in our well-awaited undertaking. We aim on bringing this to Steam Greenlight! =)Please check out our cool rewards to see what you can get for pledging!
  

We are making this game because the sRPG genre needs more love and, more importantly, games under its banner. When the Tethical engine gets released sometime in the future, sooner if this successfully gets funded(!), more sRPGs will then be able to get made by people who want to. Also, anthro characters are a fresh and fun twist style-wise. It's all about community members giving back to each other as fellow creators and we hope that you like what Tails of Tactics has to offer.

<p>The festival is actually held yearly until now in modern Egypt, of course without sacrificing anything :)</p>
<p>The story is deep, with plot twists and based on historical true events, with different themes. You will take part of historical battles between pharaohs, Persians, Arabs and Byzantines. You will play as a Byzantine noble fighting to save the girl he loves, you will also play as an Egyptian girl escaping from an oppressive military rule....</p>
<p>The PC version will have simple stealth and battle gameplay.</p>

</div></div>","Bride of the Nile game is about a legendary yearly festival for the Nile river originated in ancient Egypt where the Egyptians were believed to sacrifice a virgin to the Nile.



The festival is actually held yearly until now in modern Egypt, of course without sacrificing anything :)
The story is deep, with plot twists and based on historical true events, with different themes. You will take part of historical battles between pharaohs, Persians, Arabs and Byzantines. You will play as a Byzantine noble fighting to save the girl he loves, you will also play as an Egyptian girl escaping from an oppressive military rule....
The PC version will have simple stealth and battle gameplay.
Please try our alpha stage demo online from this link.


It should be also available on steam after we get green light (link below).


Please help us get the green light by clicking here and voting for us.


The story begins a long time ago, in ancient Egypt, right before the fall of the ancient Egyptian empire on the hands of the Persians.

The story begins in ancient Egypt during the last days of the Pharaonic empire, before their fall on the hands of the Persian invaders and the betrayal of some of the Pharaoh's military leaders.The story then shifts to the 7th century BC during the Byzantine rule of Egypt.You will meet Mary, a very beautiful Egyptian woman. Her mother is afraid that she might be chosen as the Nile’s virgin so she orders her to only come out at night where no one can see her beautiful face. One time she got out with her friends to play by the bank of Nile river, and one Byzantine noble man called Daniel saw her face from his family's nearby palace and he immediately fell in love with her. ♥He tries to talk to her and they eventually fall in love.When Daniel’s mother knows that her son fell in love and wants to marry Mary she got angry because the Egyptian are seen inferior by the Byzantine people. She started to think of a way to get rid of that Egyptian girl.What will happen to Daniel and Marry?How will the fight between the new Arab and Byzantine army affect their destiny?These are some of the characters from the game.Bride of the NileThe poor beautiful virgin chosen to be sacrificed to the Nile river.PharaohAmasis II and his son Psamtik III, the last Pharaohs defeated by the Persians invading ancient Egypt.

We are still working on the gameplay, but there will be stealth missions and hack and slash missions.We are planning to improve the gameplay.Here is a concept video of the hack and slash gameplay for some battle scenes.

You will also play in battle fields, trying to infiltrate sieges facing enemy's arrows and swords.




Here is a list of some of the OST of the game.





Until we start to create the complete 3D game, we decided to create 'Bride of the Nile' as a story (visual novel) and it is already 
released to android play store in Japanese.
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.RamadanSoft.HanayomeSoundNovel
We need $55,000 to create the complete 3D adventure game 'Bride of the Nile' with English voice acting.



More
 funding over the target will allow us to add extra levels, more 3D or 2D anime cut-scenes and add full voice acting and hopefully more platforms like mobile can be added.
If you are a gamer, please support this game that will dive into the magical world of ancient Egyptians and Arabs with japanese style drawing.



If you cannot contribute, you can always help by Spreading this campaign using social media or any other means



We are an indie game developer team.
We are the creators of ibn al-nafis visual novel (Digital Story) in English and japanese.
We decided to create a 3D game with comic style story telling called Bride of the Nile. The story covers different aspects of Egypt's history.




はじめまして。

ラマダン・ソフトのエジプト人のラマダンです。エジプトから、アラブやエジプトの歴史の同人ゲームを作成しています。イブン・アンナフィースの開発をしました。イブン・アンナフィースは今までになかったアラブの歴史のビジュアルノベル。偉大な科学者であり医者のイブン・アンナフィースの物語。舞台はエジプト、1271年（ヒジュラ暦671年）。歴史的事実に基づいたお話です。イブン・アンナフィースは同人ゲームのディーエルサイトコムでランキングになったので、応援してくれた人に心から感謝しています。それで、もっと続くと思います。そのあと、ナイルの花嫁を作成しました。ナイルの花嫁は下記のような物語です。「――西暦600年代、エジプト。この地には、古代より受け継がれる生贄の儀式が根付いていた。年に一度、任意に選ばれた”最も美しい女性”がナイル川に投げ込まれ、人食い鰐の餌食となるのだ。人々はこれを「ナイルの花嫁」と呼んでいた。一方、ビザンツ帝国の容赦無き支配に苦しむエジプトをエルサレムから、4000人の謎の部隊がその地目指していたそれは・・・イスラム軍の精鋭部隊である。迎え討つは百千万の兵力を誇るビザンツ帝国軍。両者がこの地でぶつかり合う時、ビザンツ帝国の支配に苦しむエジプトに降り注ぐのは、希望の光か、血の雨か――。」残念ながら、クオリティがあまりよくなかったです。それは申し訳ないです。今度、ゲームの部分も物語の部分もクオリティをあげて、作り直そうと思っています。戦闘のゲームプレイなども作り直そうと思っています。物語部分はまだサウンドノベルのようなものですが、イラストを描きなおそうと思っています。下記はあたらしいゲームプレイ動画です。

約束のとおり、コミケC86で購入してくださったお客様、パソコン版ができたら、同じシリアルでプレイできるようになります。ぜひわれわれのパートナーになってください。よろしくお願いします。ラマダン",25.0,3,"1 Campaign

You could choose to be a specialist with a particular QA boosted to the max, or distribute your points between the eight QA. These points, like all good things, have to be earned and can only be won by participating in fun, yet challenging events. Please note that you can upgrade an ability to its maximum level by using 100 QA points</p><h3>Special in-game items</h3><p>If the perk you choose includes receiving a character or a defense unit, you will receive them at the promised level. Please take note that you won’t be able to upgrade them further until you are at the appropriate level to do so (it will be the same level as all the other players).

For example, there are five towers that are gained through the different HQ upgrades in the game. If your pack offers you one tower, then it counts as the first unlocked tower in the game. You’ll have to wait until you reach the appropriate level to get a second one (the same level all the players get to build two towers). The good thing is that you won’t have to use in-game resources to build it, nor will it require your precious builders’ time to do so.</p><h3>Tickets to Atomic Cloud Studios Conventions</h3><p>These tickets will give you access to the activities for the whole duration of the convention. VIP tickets will grant exclusive access to special activities.</p><p>You will be able to redeem the tickets for the year and location of your choice. You can decide to redeem the tickets one at a time in order to attend multiple conventions (up to the number of tickets included in your perk), or you can share them with friends.  </p><p>Please note that accommodations, transport, etc., are not included; we offer only the tickets to enter the convention(s).</p><h3>Participation in the testing of <i>Quantum</i>
</h3><p>When the time comes, we will give you more details about this participation. It will be your responsibility to comply with the terms at that time so you can get into the testing events.</p><h3>Prototype Live Demo</h3><p>You will have access to a live demonstration of the game prototype.</p><h3>Creative session with the design team</h3><p>This will be an hour-long virtual session with our design team so you can pitch a few of your ideas and brainstorm with us. Your opinion could also be solicited about an upcoming event, for example. This session could (or not) be followed up with a few other meetings to fine-tune the concepts and details. We will let you know if that is the case. Of course, not every idea can be produced exactly as imagined, but we will do our best to make your idea come to life, keeping in mind that it will need to be in line with the vision and theme of the game.</p><h3>Customized Avatar</h3><p>In collaboration with our design team, you will create a unique and exclusive avatar for yourself. Some limitations (pornographic content, racist content, etc.) may apply.</p><h3>Follow-up information request and distribution of the rewards</h3><p>At a date still to be determined, you will receive a request for more information so we can gather all the necessary details needed to deliver the perks.</p><p>Our team will work relentlessly so that you can get your rewards as soon as we can distribute them. You will be responsible for providing us with the information in a reasonable time, and to follow our instructions to retrieve your rewards. </p><h3>Delays</h3><p>We aim to distribute the rewards as soon as the game is released so that you can enjoy them right away. If the release of the game ends up being delayed due to unfortunate circumstances, then the distribution of the rewards will be too. This is not the plan, though! Let's keep this project on track, and we will keep you informed every step of the way!</p><p> </p><p>***Wow! Very first achievement – reading through all of this!

This is why the Feedback System is an important component of Quantum.The fully integrated Feedback System will include:A) A voting system where you will be able to decide on what rewards we should offer next, some components of the events coming up, the implementation of different ideas suggested by the players community, the direction the story should be heading in, etc.B) Forums where you will be able to provide suggestions and, in collaboration with other players, improve on those suggestions so that we can make those ideas become a reality in the game.C) A fan fiction space and contests to inspire the direction the story and the following stages of the game should take.  D) Live events with the creators/producers of the game.E) Anything else you might be inclined to suggest that we’re capable of bringing to life!We can't wait to hear what you have to say! To thank you for sharing the campaign information, we will reward you with 15% (in-game Premium Currency) of the value that your friends contribute to the campaign.For example, if you share the campaign using the Indiegogo sharing features and a bunch of your friends connect to the platform using your link and contribute a total of 1,000$, you will receive 150$ worth of in-game premium currency. Make sure to use the Indiegogo sharing features as this way, we can track all the donations linked to you. Getting loads of rewards is exciting and we can't wait to distribute them to you! We want to make sure that you are 100% happy with your rewards when you get them; this is why transparency is very important to us so you know what you are getting into.Here is the detailed information you need to know and understand about the perks.In-Game Premium CurrencyFirst, please note that the Premium Currency value is the only item amongst the rewards that is cumulative and can be merged into a single account.  Unless we inform you otherwise, for the purpose of this campaign, the Premium Currency worth will be calculated this way: 1 unit = 1 USD cent value. For example, if you choose the Partner Pack (110$ Perk), you will receive 150$ worth of in-game premium currency, which will translate to 15,000 units.Name in the CreditsThe game’s website will feature a page displaying the names of all the contributors (Crew, Partner and Hero Packs). If you prefer to remain anonymous, you will be able to let us know when the time comes. Supporter Account BadgeThis will be a special badge that will be displayed in your game account to let everybody know that you directly contributed to the success of the game’s development. If you don't want it to appear, you will be able to turn it off.Quantum Ability PointsYou will be able to boost your Quantum Abilities (QA) as you choose in order to give yourself an edge. You could choose to be a specialist with a particular QA boosted to the max, or distribute your points between the eight QA. These points, like all good things, have to be earned and can only be won by participating in fun, yet challenging events. Please note that you can upgrade an ability to its maximum level by using 100 QA pointsSpecial in-game itemsIf the perk you choose includes receiving a character or a defense unit, you will receive them at the promised level. Please take note that you won’t be able to upgrade them further until you are at the appropriate level to do so (it will be the same level as all the other players). Nonetheless, having those items right from the start will give you a huge head start in the game, so we hope you will enjoy them greatly! Please have a look at this table to know more about when an item unlocks and is made available in the game.  Also, the items you will receive count as the first one(s) as the game unfolds. For example, there are five towers that are gained through the different HQ upgrades in the game. If your pack offers you one tower, then it counts as the first unlocked tower in the game. You’ll have to wait until you reach the appropriate level to get a second one (the same level all the players get to build two towers). The good thing is that you won’t have to use in-game resources to build it, nor will it require your precious builders’ time to do so.Tickets to Atomic Cloud Studios ConventionsThese tickets will give you access to the activities for the whole duration of the convention. VIP tickets will grant exclusive access to special activities.You will be able to redeem the tickets for the year and location of your choice. You can decide to redeem the tickets one at a time in order to attend multiple conventions (up to the number of tickets included in your perk), or you can share them with friends.  Please note that accommodations, transport, etc., are not included; we offer only the tickets to enter the convention(s).Participation in the testing of Quantum
When the time comes, we will give you more details about this participation. It will be your responsibility to comply with the terms at that time so you can get into the testing events.Prototype Live DemoYou will have access to a live demonstration of the game prototype.Creative session with the design teamThis will be an hour-long virtual session with our design team so you can pitch a few of your ideas and brainstorm with us. Your opinion could also be solicited about an upcoming event, for example. This session could (or not) be followed up with a few other meetings to fine-tune the concepts and details. We will let you know if that is the case. Of course, not every idea can be produced exactly as imagined, but we will do our best to make your idea come to life, keeping in mind that it will need to be in line with the vision and theme of the game.Customized AvatarIn collaboration with our design team, you will create a unique and exclusive avatar for yourself. Some limitations (pornographic content, racist content, etc.) may apply.Follow-up information request and distribution of the rewardsAt a date still to be determined, you will receive a request for more information so we can gather all the necessary details needed to deliver the perks.Our team will work relentlessly so that you can get your rewards as soon as we can distribute them. You will be responsible for providing us with the information in a reasonable time, and to follow our instructions to retrieve your rewards. DelaysWe aim to distribute the rewards as soon as the game is released so that you can enjoy them right away. If the release of the game ends up being delayed due to unfortunate circumstances, then the distribution of the rewards will be too. This is not the plan, though! Let's keep this project on track, and we will keep you informed every step of the way! ***Wow! Very first achievement – reading through all of this!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi everyone! My name's Oleksandr (Alex) Shumakov, i am from Ukraine. With my 11-year-old son Nikita (Nick) we've formed ""DIY interactive"" team for this project. I have to state that I'm not affiliated with Microsoft in any way. I have some skills in working with Microsoft Excel and Visual Basic For Applications (VBA). I love this program for it's flexibility. Some time ago I've heard about games written entirely in Excel macros and loved this idea. Besides the fun side, it also gives an opportunity to develop an effective algorithms for VBA (including needed optimizations assuming demanding character of the video games). So this project was started to try the abilities of VBA to run complex macro as fast and stable as it can. Supporting this project, you help to extend the imaginary limits of using Microsoft Excel as universal building platform to do virtually anything (from performing simple spreadsheet calculations to making entertaining software). It's means not just to support another indie retro-pixel game - it means to support new ideology.</p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
</div><div>
<p>This project exists since 2016. At the present time the project is on the stage of writing the levels for the game (the two of them are complete for now, the number of 7 planned total) and eliminating some minor bugs. This will require some time to work with. Besides the ability to find free time for completing all needed steps, your support will clearly show the interest to this project and it will boost our enthusiasm (all we know how long the so called ""pet projects"" can be developed and how often they are leaved not finished because of lack of motivation and free time). If everyone of those who interested in progress of VBA programming and who supports above-mentioned idea will spend at least 1$ to support it, we will see decent sum at the end of company. Retro pixel games fans and pixel art lovers also welcomed.</p>
<p>All the bakers will receive the copy of game soon after the ending of campaign. For 10$ and more the game file will be open for edition and API for creation of your own levels will be added (all the documents will be in English). We can guarantee that you will receive working version of game for Microsoft Office on Windows. If you strongly dislike the retro-pixel appearance of the game (110 x 78 ""pixels"" per game screen, 56 colors palette!) or it's possibility to run unstable in rare circumstances (because we can't test it on all possible Windows / Office/ machine configurations) then you shouldn't fund it.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As was described above, this project is not just another indie retro-looking game, but trying to refine the VBA programming and to make the limits of Excel using wider. You should understand that VBA itself has some issues which make the VBA programs weak in terms of speed and stability. Our program tries to overwhelm some of them by electing most effective algorithms for doing some things in Excel (especially, when it comes to the VBA work with spreadsheet cells). The actual version of our 3D engine is working and stable enough to run it as an entertaining game and to have a fun with it. It wasn't easy to make it work at mean 24 FPS on average office ""workhorses"" (as I am not a professional programmer, it was personal challenge for me too). Another challenge was to achieve some in-game features as reasonably detailed picture with relatively modern shaders (reflection, transparency, blur), having only 110x78 screen with 56 (!) colors, available in Excel for cell-painting user palette. And I have to create special compressor/extractor procedure to store music/sounds within the .xls file not as ActiveX objects (for reasons of running the game on all the versions of Excel). But now it all works. All the additional media in the game (including pixel art, 3D polygonal/voxel models, sounds and music) were created by me too. As i don't know any game projects in Excel which gained the support and audience in crowd-finding platforms, our project will be the first one - just support it to make it happen.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
</div><div>
<p>As it was mentioned above, this project need some additional efforts to be completed. I suppose (but I can't guarantee) that we can make it running 100% stable on virtually any PC with Microsoft  Windows / Office installed (for now the game is tested for integrity with the Win XP, Win 8 and Win 10, but on a few machines). Nevertheless I can guarantee that all the game additional parts (including art and sounds/music, levels) will be completed.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><b>GREAT FOR FOREIGN PILOTS! </b></h2>
</div>
<div>
<b>Most of what you will learn about aviation (book-wise), is gleaned from studying the Private Pilot rating.</b>  The <b>P</b>rivate <b>P</b>ilot <b>L</b>icense requirements are the foundation your future aviation endeavors will be built upon.  At a price-point of $199 (USD) the ASCEND Private Pilot board game is far less expensive than many CD-Rom and DVD training platforms, while requiring  something current training methods do not  - <b>i.e.</b> <b>direct verbal interaction between pilots...which leads to one of the reasons for creating this method of study - </b><ul>
<li>English is the international language of aviation. </li>
<li>
<b>The one thing specific to aviation around the world is the ability to read, write and speak English.  This fact has made the United States the </b><b>#1 training environment for pilots world-wide.  </b>
</li>
<li>When international flights go into and out of countries around the world, English is the language used to bridge communication, which makes speaking English extremely important for foreign pilots. </li>
<li>This study platform is an excellent way of training pilots, as it forces verbal interaction to ask and answer the questions in English.</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>                    It's all about pilot interaction!!</b></h3>
<p><b>United States issued Commercial Licenses to over 4,820 foreign Pilots in 20l2, and over 10,000 thousand received their Private and Instrument ratings from within the United States.  <i>Many more international licenses are predicted in the next 10 years due to the retiring Global workforce of Aviators. </i></b></p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>
<span style=""font-style: italic; letter-spacing: 0px;"">As a student pilot back in 2007, I witnessed several </span><i>foreign</i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><i> student pilots lose their Student Visas and be quietly ushered out of the country after the Flight School cashed their check because they could not speak English fluently.</i> </span>
</li></ul>
<p><b><i>ASCEND </i></b>is based on the value of interactive study.  I believe you gain and retain more from studying aviation with a partner than studying alone. While on my journey to the sky, I spent (and wasted) money on training DVD's and CD-ROM training programs that challenged my patience.  I created this game because of an undeniable truth: if you make learning fun, your brain is more receptive to the information.  Utilizing the ASCEND game to interact and train with other pilots creates an atmosphere of inspiration.  Foreign Pilots gain a great advantage using the <b style=""font-style: italic;"">ASCEND Method.  </b>Communication in English is a necessity throughout the entire game.  Domestic (United States Pilots) gain a huge benefit by interacting with international pilots as well.  When you are circling in a pattern with 16 pilots from various countries, you will have a better understanding of what is being communicated.  Lets face it, buzzing around a training airport with pilots you don't understand, is dangerous.</p>

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Question categories around the board increase in complexity  i.e. answering a question that requires calculation (weight and balance is a good example) are harder to figure than answering a simple question about the four forces that act on an airplane during straight and level flight - (Aerodynamics)</span><br/>

<p><b>The airport you sit in front of is promised to you, but you cannot charge other pilots for flying through your airspace until you gain enough money and flight time to  purchase it. </b>The tail numbers on your airport will be utilized by you throughout the game at every trip around the board. Communication is one of the biggest reasons for creating this game, so you will verbally utilize your N-numbers when asked questions on approach and departure along with certain other category questions.  </p>

<div></div>Your very own one-of-a-kind <b>EasyPLotter!</b>  Used it for quick navigation calculations and keep it in your kneeboard or glove box.  The Ascend <b>EasyPlotter</b> is easier to handle in the cockpit than full-size plotters, and its design helps a pilot to picture the process of diverting to another airport while en route. The four sides of the plotter are Nautical Mile rulers – 30NM per side, and every hash-mark measurement on the inside is a Nautical Mile. The large outer circle is the 20NM diameter of Class C Airspace.  This is a handy little bugger!  Can be used as a Ninja throwing star in a hostile situation.<div>

<p>With the success of this campaign, I will be able to realize a dream that has been ongoing since 2007. I look forward to completing board games for Instrument Pilot, Commercial Pilot, Air Transport Pilot, and ASCEND for Kids game/training platforms.</p>
<p>The challenges are many, but not overwhelming. If you have made it this far into my campaign presentation, I am grateful. I have buffered my rewards timelines by a few months to allow for snags, and ensure on-time delivery.  The game will require 4 solid months for production and assembly.  I have scheduled 7.  If everything goes semi-smooth with not too many major snags, the game should be available in June.  If Mr. Murphy plays a large roll, the game will ship in August.  I am hoping for normal production scenarios, but am fully prepared to wake and make my way through a Lord-of-the-Rings-sized spider-web made from 1/8"" aircraft cable.</p>

NOTE TO CFI's - THIS IS A COMPREHENSIVE STUDY METHOD FOR AVIATION, DISGUISED AS A ""GAME"" - This is a serious aviation training platform demanding  pilot interaction with other pilots to verbally answer actual FAA questions that are given for the Private Pilot Rating.  I have received comments from pilots who have mentioned that flight training needs to be taken seriously and should not be thought of as a ""game"" - I wholeheartedly disagree with most of that mindset.  I personally got into aviation because of the freedom, excitement and fun it embodies.  This is a wonderful and interactive method of learning about aviation concepts, terms and test questions that will be asked on the Private Pilot Written Exam.  Student Pilots should utilize their ongoing knowledge and study of aviation through verbal instruction from a CFI, books, CDROM and other training materials  at their disposal to become a solid player of the ASCEND board game.  


Please take a moment to clear your mind.  Focus on the one dream that gave you purpose. Remember back to a time when all you needed was someone's faith to enable your resolve and push you to do great things.

If you are able to focus on the freedom and beauty this picture conveys, then you understand the roll you pay in helping me attain my goal.

GREAT FOR FOREIGN PILOTS! 


Most of what you will learn about aviation (book-wise), is gleaned from studying the Private Pilot rating.  The Private Pilot License requirements are the foundation your future aviation endeavors will be built upon.  At a price-point of $199 (USD) the ASCEND Private Pilot board game is far less expensive than many CD-Rom and DVD training platforms, while requiring  something current training methods do not  - i.e. direct verbal interaction between pilots...which leads to one of the reasons for creating this method of study - 
English is the international language of aviation. 

The one thing specific to aviation around the world is the ability to read, write and speak English.  This fact has made the United States the #1 training environment for pilots world-wide.  

When international flights go into and out of countries around the world, English is the language used to bridge communication, which makes speaking English extremely important for foreign pilots. 
This study platform is an excellent way of training pilots, as it forces verbal interaction to ask and answer the questions in English.

                    It's all about pilot interaction!!
United States issued Commercial Licenses to over 4,820 foreign Pilots in 20l2, and over 10,000 thousand received their Private and Instrument ratings from within the United States.  Many more international licenses are predicted in the next 10 years due to the retiring Global workforce of Aviators. 


As a student pilot back in 2007, I witnessed several foreign student pilots lose their Student Visas and be quietly ushered out of the country after the Flight School cashed their check because they could not speak English fluently. 

ASCEND is based on the value of interactive study.  I believe you gain and retain more from studying aviation with a partner than studying alone. While on my journey to the sky, I spent (and wasted) money on training DVD's and CD-ROM training programs that challenged my patience.  I created this game because of an undeniable truth: if you make learning fun, your brain is more receptive to the information.  Utilizing the ASCEND game to interact and train with other pilots creates an atmosphere of inspiration.  Foreign Pilots gain a great advantage using the ASCEND Method.  Communication in English is a necessity throughout the entire game.  Domestic (United States Pilots) gain a huge benefit by interacting with international pilots as well.  When you are circling in a pattern with 16 pilots from various countries, you will have a better understanding of what is being communicated.  Lets face it, buzzing around a training airport with pilots you don't understand, is dangerous.


It is my intent to leave no question unanswered.  Please become an active participant in this campaign by scrutinizing it and asking questions.  After 7 years since inception, there are very few questions I cannot answer quickly.



     The game produces safer pilots. 




AVIATION IS ALL ABOUT RULES - If you find this game has too many rules to follow...please save the life of yourself and the people who may fly with you by choosing another hobby or career path...seriously.



PLEASE READ ON...




               
                QUESTION CARDS

Question Cards are the bread and butter of the game.  Different color cards have different monetary value.  The question cards come in a 9""L X 3""W X 4""T box - When a pilot lands on a category, the question card is pulled from the box and read to the pilot.  The card is then returned to the back of the card stack.  The number of cards per category will differ -  i.e. there are more questions pertaining to                                                      AERODYNAMICS than there are for AIRSPACE.

QUESTION CARDS WILL BE UPDATED ALONG WITH THE FAA QUESTIONS THAT ARE ADDED AND SUBTRACTED EVERY YEAR  
FAA questions will be reviewed every 6 months.  Updated question cards will be available to order through the ASCEND Web-site for 1 year from the date of your game purchase.  After the first year you will be able to order updated cards for a nominal fee along with shipping.   If you wish to pass your game onto another student pilot, they can goto the ASCEND web-site and save some money by purchasing new sets of cards or upgrades to the planes or board surface.  It all depends on the success of this campaign!

                   THE SPINNER   


You will notice an inner and outer circle.  The inner ring (white numbered circle) represents how many spaces a pilot travels around the board after spinning.  This is the primary use of the spinner...so forget about the outer ring until you are called upon to calculate reward or penalty for certain spaces around the game surface.

The outer multi-colored ring is also used to calculate penalty or reward for many different questions - a pilot calculates their penalty or reward by spinning 2 times - the first spin is a number, and the second spin is the value.  The pilot multiplies these to either collect money or give money based on the scenario.  




     
                   
                    THE MONEY  

The color of money coincides with the outer ring of the spinner.  


Players track their progress by collecting money for correct answers and giving money for incorrect answers.  The money you receive or give for questions during the game increases with value as you travel around the board.  This is for three reasons: 




Question categories around the board increase in complexity  i.e. answering a question that requires calculation (weight and balance is a good example) are harder to figure than answering a simple question about the four forces that act on an airplane during straight and level flight - (Aerodynamics)

Most aviation training begins with the relatively simple topic of ""Aerodynamics"" and introduces more complex topics as you move through your syllabus (Cross Country Flight Planning) - You can't start training a student pilot by telling them to put together a flight plan prior to understanding why the airplane stays in the air.  For this reason, the categories are valued by the general order in which most pilots will be trained - 

I wanted to design money with different planes on it to represent higher monetary value because it was just cool.



         AIRPORTS AND TAIL NUMBERS  

Your AIRPORT and the TAIL NUMBERS are spun for at the beginning of the game along with being the point of the game.
The airport you sit in front of is promised to you, but you cannot charge other pilots for flying through your airspace until you gain enough money and flight time to  purchase it. The tail numbers on your airport will be utilized by you throughout the game at every trip around the board. Communication is one of the biggest reasons for creating this game, so you will verbally utilize your N-numbers when asked questions on approach and departure along with certain other category questions.  
                                      
             


 IN-FIELD CARDS

The cards are placed on the inside of the board (thus the name) - like the ""Chance"" and ""Community Chest"" on a Monopoly board.  They are the only cards in the game that are not questions asked in the FAA written test.  The ALIEN and BUSH PILOT cards contain funny happenstance scenarios that pilots have no control over.  The HOBBS cards were created to track progress through the game and the IFE (In-Flight-Emergency) cards were created for sheer torture.  



                                             



          This is the back of the box showing contents of the game


The ASCEND Game Tokens are a HUGE part of gameplay. Not only will you be asked to recite V-speeds and other information regarding the aircraft you are flying around the board (each set of planes comes with V-speeds info to memorize) you will be able to advance from Single Engine to Twin Engine and eventually Jet.  Every time you advance (earn) your next rating, you gain the ability to fly faster around the board while on a  mission to buy an airport before other pilots and charge them for entering your ""airspace"" - 

ASCEND WILL OFFER DIFFERENT AIRPLANE TOKENS FOR PURCHASE  THROUGH THE WEBSITE  

The original game was going to include 12 different aircraft, but due to the constraints of time and money, we opted to have 3 different types of aircraft and use the color of the airplanes and airplane pedestals to differentiate between pilots.
When the ball gets rolling and we turn a profit, the web-site will offer many customized items to enhance the game experience.  If you look closely at the back of the box (further down in the campaign) you will see the original designs.  We wanted these, but I would have had to sell a kidney to make it happen, and that was unacceptable...but just barely.
         4 Mooney (single engine) 4 DC-3 (Multi-Engine) and 4 Blackbirds (Jet)




                                      
The single engine ASCEND Game token, a representation of the Mooney M20, has 2"" wingspan, 1.5"" fusalage.  All Game airplane tokens are made from a 95% Pewter/5% Silver mixture, and differ in weight between 8 grams (Mooney),  14 grams (DC-3), and 20 grams (Blackbird).  the planes are manufactured with a  1/4"" diameter and 1/16"" thick neodymium magnet that is cemented into a fitted recess in the fuselage.           



           
This is a short video of the prototype pedestal and airplane
      

          AIRCRAFT PEDESTALS 
These are a few of the aircraft pedestals - each game contains 4 different colors.  Every airplane pedestal is hand poured by yours truly.  Believe me when I say no two pedestals are the same.  They are magnetized and the planes contain a very strong neodymium magnet.  It makes for a work of gaming art.
                                  
                         
          When I say no two pedestals are the same, I'm not kidding.


      

The Future Of The ASCEND Private Pilot board game is going to ROCK SOME SOCKS OFF!!

GAME SURFACE AND QUESTION CARDS WILL BE CUSTOMIZED TO REFLECT DIFFERENT TRAINING  ENVIRONMENTS
Due to my own personal training experience and the huge number of training pilots around Daytona Beach, Florida, the first pressing of the game (500 copies) will all be the same (tailored to KDAB) but future games will be available for customization.  The N-numbers can be customized to reflect actual planes that you trained in, (or an inside joke or your initials and birthdate etc) - likewise, many of the questions pertaining to Departure and Approach frequencies can be tailored through the web-site to reflect your actual flight training scenario.


 The success of this campaign is the realization of a dream that has been ongoing since 2007.  I am grateful for your contribution.  Many of the rewards offered for your help are already produced, packaged and ready for shipment.  Your contribution is being used directly to finish the manufacturing and assembly of the ASCEND Game.  Please spread the word and help me get this product on a shelf.  Please let me know what you would like to see as a reward and I'll try my best to make it happen.  NOTE:  EVERY REWARD WILL CONTAIN AN EASYPLOTTER AS WELL AS WHAT IS LISTED.






$5  PLAN YOUR FLIGHT  $5
Your very own one-of-a-kind EasyPLotter!  Used it for quick navigation calculations and keep it in your kneeboard or glove box.  The Ascend EasyPlotter is easier to handle in the cockpit than full-size plotters, and its design helps a pilot to picture the process of diverting to another airport while en route. The four sides of the plotter are Nautical Mile rulers – 30NM per side, and every hash-mark measurement on the inside is a Nautical Mile. The large outer circle is the 20NM diameter of Class C Airspace.  This is a handy little bugger!  Can be used as a Ninja throwing star in a hostile situation.














$10  KDAB SPECIAL  $10These beverage coasters are the same 4 designs as the $15 variety, but are about 1/3 as resilient and durable.  They will do the trick to protect your oak table from a sweating glass of ice-cold Mountain Dew!  I added this PERK for friends who are not pilots so they can contribute and receive a gift for their contribution that they can use:)








$10  FLIGHT PLAN +1  $10
These are great for the keychain.  You will receive the EasyPlotter along with the ASCEND travel USB - The USB holds 128 megs, so it holds just enough info to store flight planning info (phone book info and travel reminders along with destination airport info) but not enough to get you into trouble if you lose it.









$10  FLIGHT PLAN +1  $10
Due to allot of my friends and family not being pilots or into aviation, I am creating another $10 PERK to include a ASCEND Travel USB and a set of ACE beverage coasters instead of the Plotter.  I figured the coasters would be more useful to friends who don't need a Plotter in their life...but hey, everyone can use beverage coasters!






$15  OUT OF THE HANGAR!  $15
You have taken your first steps into the wonderful world of ASCEND! Whether you are a pilot, aviation enthusiast, or just need to be inspired vicariously through positive Juju...we are here for you. Live long and prosper, and thank you for your support. You will receive a set of four ACE Beverage Coasters and the ASCEND EasyPlotter

4 Different Designs on the back include...
Popular V-Speeds
Airspace VFR Minimums 
Weather Report Reference Guide
(KDAB) Airport Diagram and Frequencies  



 
 
$25  THE RUNUP!  $25
If you love airplanes and appreciate the hard work of several inspired people...you will love a pewter/silver Mooney MC20 game token on a pedestal along with a heartfelt batch of appreciation and the ASCEND EasyPlotter.   If you get caught flying the plane around while making airplane engine noises...you're on your own.   The airplane also doubles as refrigerator magnet when not being used in the game.
                



As an added bonus, I store all the airplane tokens in old coffee containers...so your plane will smell like Juan Valdez and subsequently make you crave a scone.






$30  THE ""GO AROUND""   $30
The SR71 is pretty cool, but some of you have requested the ascend product package instead (and you still get a cool airplane token to stick on your refrigerator;)  You will receive the ASCEND EasyPlotter, a set of ACE Beverage Coasters and the Mooney Pewter/Silver aircraft token with custom Pedestal.  I have all these products in stock, so this will be one of the first PERKS mailed out.




  

$35  TAXI TO ACTIVE   $35
You will receive the magnetic SR-71 Blackbird Game Token with base and set of ACE beverage coasters and the EASYPLOTTER - The SR71 comes in silver or flat black. 


  







  
     $55  TAXI TO ACTIVE   $55
Receive a high quality one-of-a-kind Sportech embroidered short sleeve golf shirt.  Front and back embroidery and multiple colors and sizes to choose from.  These are great to wear in the cockpit as well! - you will also receive a set of ASCEND ACE beverage coasters along with the EASYPLOTTER and a Mooney airplane game token with pedestal.  These shirts retail for $45.00 - you will not be disappointed...and you can say you have been a part of this company since it's humble beginning.  PLEASE EMAIL ME FOR SIZE AND COLOR AVAILABILITY PRIOR TO PICKING THIS PERK.


                                        
   


               
              Colors include Black, Grey, Burgundy, Light Blue, White and Hot Pink

            




                                  

 
$100 BALLS TO THE WALL! $100You will receive a Full set of question/flash cards with separator cards from the ASCEND Private Pilot game (over 900 in all, color coded and category specific). These are the coolest flashcards ever created for aviation training.  Complete with reference/question numbers that coincide with question explanations and more!    If playing a game to learn about aviation doesn't float your seaplane or you are training alone, using these flashcards will help you prepare for your FAA written test for Private Pilot.  Great to use with a friend as well during that morning cup of pre-flight coffee.  You will also receive the EasyPlotter...which comes in handy if you need to scrape frost from the windshield of your 172 in the early morning hours.  It fits nicely in your kneeboard.




  
$150  FLYIN' HIGH AGAIN!   $150

$50 discount from MSRP!  For your contribution of $150 you will receive a signed copy of the first full pressing of the ASCEND Private Pilot game along with a set of ASCEND ACE beverage coasters and an ASCEND EASY-Plotter.  Your name will be immortalized on the inside top of the game box (280 spaces available) along with lifelong recognition on the ASCEND web-site.




           

 $200  MONEY FOR FOOD  $200
LightSpeed Headset with EQ and noise dampening - It's all or nothing time folks! I have spent my last dime on getting this game produced, and its success will help me upgrade my headset. Until that time, I am selling all my flight gear at a very large discount. This headset was over $800 new in 2007 - it has been fully refurbished by LightSpeed Aviation with new cable, connections and ear pads - I love this headset, and LightSpeed headsets are known for being comfortable. I can testify.  You will also receive the single engine Mooney aircraft token with pedestal, the ASCEND EasyPlotter and a set of ACE beverage coasters.




           
             
           THE THANK YOU LIST
To these people I owe a debt of overwhelming gratitude for their monetary, spiritual and mental support and friendship through the past 7 years since my life-changing quest to fly an airplane - There are many more to add, and the list will grow through this campaign as certain pictures and memories in this campaign will trigger a grateful addition.

Rocky the Training Gorilla


With the success of this campaign, I will be able to realize a dream that has been ongoing since 2007. I look forward to completing board games for Instrument Pilot, Commercial Pilot, Air Transport Pilot, and ASCEND for Kids game/training platforms.
The challenges are many, but not overwhelming. If you have made it this far into my campaign presentation, I am grateful. I have buffered my rewards timelines by a few months to allow for snags, and ensure on-time delivery.  The game will require 4 solid months for production and assembly.  I have scheduled 7.  If everything goes semi-smooth with not too many major snags, the game should be available in June.  If Mr. Murphy plays a large roll, the game will ship in August.  I am hoping for normal production scenarios, but am fully prepared to wake and make my way through a Lord-of-the-Rings-sized spider-web made from 1/8"" aircraft cable.

<p>“Eco de los gigantes” or as in English “Echo of the giants”, is a third-person educational video game, based on a system of free exploration of an isometric environment and various additional dynamics through mini-games. The game focuses on the math curriculum for first grade. </p>
<p>The player represents a character named Ecco, a child carried by the waves to the beaches of this island after his boat shipwrecked.
</p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://life2play.co/img/campaign/game/1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/> </div><div>Upon reaching the coast, Ecco is saved by a monk who will be responsible to guide him through the story.  </div><div>

<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://life2play.co/img/campaign/game/6.png"" src="""" style=""""/> </div>
<div>The idea behind ""Echo of the giants"" is to present a fun game, at the level of any other video game with entertainment purposes; whereby children can also receive and live learning experiences that are considered significant due to its content, which represent real situations where concepts of mathematics and abstract thinking are applied, which are the basis for our current thinking system. </div>
<div>Also, it is purpose of ""Echo of the giants"" make it easier for teachers and parents the task of teaching and introducing the topics of the mathematics curriculum, because they can propose strategies and exercises around the personal experiences that each child has already lived in the game. </div>
<div>This first installment of “Echo of the giants” focuses on mathematics for first graders. Therefore, the game is intended to accompany the school year, setting limits according to the progress of the curriculum set by the teacher.
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>STAGES</h3>
<div>
<p>The game is
divided in three different stages:</p>
<h4>FIRST STAGE: EXPLORATION</h4>
The game is set in a 3D world where the child can explore it freely. It contains different characters and elements that set out problems to be resolved by the student in order to continue their progress in the story. </div>
<div>

</div>
<h4>SECOND STAGE: FREE INTERACTION</h4>
Each object and character within the game provides different options for interaction in the microworld; they introduce some small games or dynamics, but others pose complete problematic situations. </div>

<div>
<h4>THIRD STAGE: MINI-GAMES</h4>
Each mini-game is posed around the curricular axes for math created by various international institutions. The characters who the child interacts with will propose these. For further learning, no mini-game is allowed to be completed by trial and error, so that the child understands what and why is answering that. Every success and every mistake counts. </div>

<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://life2play.co/img/campaign/proposal/title.gif"" src="""" style=""background-color: initial;""/> </div>
<div>Currently the prevailing teaching method in the classroom has created in the students apathy, disinterest and lack of motivation towards acquiring new knowledge;</div>
<div>  
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://life2play.co/img/campaign/proposal/1.jpg"" src="""" style=""background-color: initial;""/> </div>
<div>This is the specific case of mathematics, where the student has become a passive actor of their learning process, by simply memorizing formulas and operations without knowing their real applications, banishing in this way the young people who fail to have good grades in this area from the paradise of the mathematics, labeling this subject as tedious, boring and useless. </div>
<div>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://life2play.co/img/campaign/proposal/2.jpg"" src="""" style=""background-color: initial;""/> </div>
<div>The game is based on a system of free exploration of a virtual environment where the child is master of time and the way they explore it. A world that presents them challenges that simulate the situations that gave rise to the concepts of mathematics. If you want to learn well, you need to understand well, but this requires to reconstruct mentally not only the concept, but also the path that leads from the physical gesture to its concept or object. </div>
<div>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://life2play.co/img/campaign/proposal/3.jpg"" src="""" style=""background-color: initial;""/> </div>
<div>“Echo of the giants” proposes a system where all actors of the learning process can find relevant tools towards their point of view, but that revolve around the same experience, the game.</div>
<div>These actors are: teachers, parents and students; In addition to educational institutions, which represent the collective interest of teachers. </div>
<div>Advantages of using ""Echo of the giants"": </div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Allows to decouple learning from the mental limits of a classroom or specific hours, because it can be used both inside and outside school. </span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Brings the teacher and the concepts closer to the children minds, because with the experiences lived in the video game the teacher can carry out a dialogue in a common field known by both.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">It presents an alternative to the classic video games, with great fun, entertainment and educational quality. </span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">It can be consolidated as an alternative to the grading system, because not only measures the child's performance at a specific moment with a written test, but its development throughout the school year.</span><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>PINVED</h3>
As we know, the task of parents and teachers is different from the students, so we created a tool called ""Platform for integration of educational video games"" or PINVED (for its acronym in Spanish). </div>
<div>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://life2play.co/img/campaign/proposal/4.jpg"" src="""" style=""background-color: initial;""/> </div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">PINVED will allow parents and teachers to participate in the knowledge acquired by the children throughout the game, but with the use of control, supervision and guidance tools. </span></div>
<div>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://life2play.co/img/campaign/proposal/5.jpg"" src="""" style=""background-color: initial;""/>
</div>
<div>
<p>PINVED is a web platform that can be used from
any browser. This platform provides different tools for parents and
teachers such as:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Being able to access guidelines for
	parents or teachers that explain the use of the platform and video
	games (in the future there will be more games on the same line).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Control the maximum progress in the game
	of the students in charge, so they don't surpass the teacher
	progress in class.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Detailed charts of the progress of their
	children or students, where the overall progress in the history
	(curriculum) and individual progress by topic (per mini-game) are
	outlined.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Knowing the quantity of successful and
	failed attempts to play each mini-game, representing the progress,
	understanding and affinity the player has of the topic represented
	by it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Knowing the curricular content of each
	mini-game from the video games which the teacher or parent has an
	active subscription.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Full control over child accounts (for
	parents), which includes parental control over playing time.</p>

<h4>LET'S GET IN AN ADVENTURE TOGETHER</h4>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://life2play.co/img/campaign/budget/0.png"" src="""" style=""background-color: initial;""/>
<div><br/></div>
We want to go in an adventure like Ecco of “Echo of the giants”, the future is unknown but the goal is clear, transform the way we and our kids learn, and we want you to go with us. We believe that with this project we open the door to many of us to create and found a new way to learn, where the knowledge matters in the real world and we get prepare to fight the real enemy, the apathy and the ignorance, instead of training to fill papers and test after test. “Echo of the giants” is going to be the first step of many we want to take with you. The idea is to create environments and stories that teach the children not only the basis of science but the basis of our society and how they are useful through the use of their unique set of skills and the knowledge they can get from the world an others, that's why we are betting to use a character (Ecco) whit whom the child and even us can make a travel to rediscover the path our ancestors made to create the society we live nowadays. </div>
<div>The project is long and will cover the entire school year through repetitive learning reinforcement dynamics, gradual release of events, global goals and a community around the game. It is a task that requires effort and commitment. We want to position the country as an alternative when developing video games. To do so, we need your support. Although we have already received financial support from the national government (developing important parts of the game and the web platform) we need your help to keep delivering the same high quality that we have presented, until the final phase. </div>
<div>We have currently developed the first part of the first unit and the basis of “Echo of the giants”, as well as the rudiments of the platform PINVED, as was intended at first with the government contribution, but we want to finish the game. The game is going to be formed by 8 units, which represents the topics:
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pre-math concepts (about 9 mini-games)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Numbers until 10 (about 20 mini-games)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Basic adding and subtracting (about 16
	mini-games)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Operations with 3 single-digit numbers
	(about 5 mini-games)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Numbers until 100 (about 10 mini-games)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advanced adding and subtracting (about 9
	mini-games)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adding and subtracting with 2-digit
	numbers (about 11 mini-games)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Measurement units (about 15 mini-games)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are about 100 mini-games just for solely
curricular purposes, but it is intended to have a lot of more
mini-game for fun, objects to collect, comics to read, characters to
know, a lot of exciting options!</p>
<p>It is planned to fulfill the following goals
with your contributions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Voice acting in both
	English and Spanish for all the texts and dialogues within the game,
	to ease the process of reading to children.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Music and sound effects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Complete the game
	programming.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finish the development
	of the platform PINVED both in English and Spanish.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The contributions received are
going to be distributed as follows:</p>
<br/>

<div>Founded in 2015, in the city of Bucaramanga, Colombia; as a product of a persistent idea that materialized as a company. Life2play is a company dedicated to game development and to create complete experiences that embark the viewer in an experience that transcends the screen and the controller, and the mere concept of harmless fun. Created in order to contribute to solving social problems. </div>
<div>Life2play was conceived in the Universidad Industrial de Santander (UIS), or as in English: Industrial University of Santander.

<div>
<h3>MISSION</h3>
<br/>
</div>
<div><p>Contribute to the improvement of educational
quality by using innovative techniques in technology, computing and
communication, to create engagement and fun around the learning
process.</p></div>
<div><h3>VISION</h3></div>
<div>
<p>Be a leader in the education field, promoting
the appropriation of one's learning processes, and the inclusion of
all actors in this formative process, through our products and the
creation of our own proposals for education, both nationally and
internationally.</p>
<p>Conceived in 2014, we have gone through many
processes of selection and evaluation by the government of Colombia
to make us worthy of seed capital delivered by the ""Fondo
emprender"", which was given in 2015. The idea was supported by
the degree project of our founder, in which he proposed the video
game ""Echo of the giants"" and the recommended learning
environment to apply the suggested learning strategy. The project was
awarded the best possible grade and was a candidate for the laureate
degree project award.</p>
</div>
<div><h3>THE FOUNDER</h3></div>
<div><p>Gonzalo Barrera has been a professional
recognized multiple times nationally. He was one of the top 100 high
school graduates in the country in 2008 and one of the top 100
undergraduate graduates of the country in 2014, obtaining the
recognition ""SUMMA CUM LAUDE"" as the best systems engineer
of 2014 from the Universidad Industrial de Santander (UIS) due to his
academic performance.</p></div>
<div><h3>THE CORE STAFF</h3></div>
<div>
<p>Our team was
chosen after a rigorous selection process with the aim of supporting
new talent.</p>

<p>In Life2play
we care not only to create stunning and immersive experiences, but

committed to support young talent and train professionals... rather
people with great professional and personal qualities that contribute

“A NEW WAY TO LEARN”
Android/IOS/Windows/MAC/Linux



 




 


DYNAMIC
“Eco de los gigantes” or as in English “Echo of the giants”, is a third-person educational video game, based on a system of free exploration of an isometric environment and various additional dynamics through mini-games. The game focuses on the math curriculum for first grade. 
The player represents a character named Ecco, a child carried by the waves to the beaches of this island after his boat shipwrecked.

 Upon reaching the coast, Ecco is saved by a monk who will be responsible to guide him through the story.  
  

The purpose of the character is explore the island, solving challenges and helping its inhabitants to fill their knowledge gaps caused by the dark magician, thus discovering that knowledge is everywhere and especially in oneself, through experience and reflection,  
 

to finally remove the blindfold from the magician followers and defeat once for all the evil sorcerer who enslaved their minds. 



KNOW SOME OF THE INHABITANTS

 
The idea behind ""Echo of the giants"" is to present a fun game, at the level of any other video game with entertainment purposes; whereby children can also receive and live learning experiences that are considered significant due to its content, which represent real situations where concepts of mathematics and abstract thinking are applied, which are the basis for our current thinking system. 
Also, it is purpose of ""Echo of the giants"" make it easier for teachers and parents the task of teaching and introducing the topics of the mathematics curriculum, because they can propose strategies and exercises around the personal experiences that each child has already lived in the game. 
This first installment of “Echo of the giants” focuses on mathematics for first graders. Therefore, the game is intended to accompany the school year, setting limits according to the progress of the curriculum set by the teacher.

STAGES

The game is
divided in three different stages:
FIRST STAGE: EXPLORATION
The game is set in a 3D world where the child can explore it freely. It contains different characters and elements that set out problems to be resolved by the student in order to continue their progress in the story. 

 

 

 



SECOND STAGE: FREE INTERACTION
Each object and character within the game provides different options for interaction in the microworld; they introduce some small games or dynamics, but others pose complete problematic situations. 

 

 

 

 

THIRD STAGE: MINI-GAMES
Each mini-game is posed around the curricular axes for math created by various international institutions. The characters who the child interacts with will propose these. For further learning, no mini-game is allowed to be completed by trial and error, so that the child understands what and why is answering that. Every success and every mistake counts. 




 


 
Currently the prevailing teaching method in the classroom has created in the students apathy, disinterest and lack of motivation towards acquiring new knowledge;
  
 
This is the specific case of mathematics, where the student has become a passive actor of their learning process, by simply memorizing formulas and operations without knowing their real applications, banishing in this way the young people who fail to have good grades in this area from the paradise of the mathematics, labeling this subject as tedious, boring and useless. 

 
The game is based on a system of free exploration of a virtual environment where the child is master of time and the way they explore it. A world that presents them challenges that simulate the situations that gave rise to the concepts of mathematics. If you want to learn well, you need to understand well, but this requires to reconstruct mentally not only the concept, but also the path that leads from the physical gesture to its concept or object. 

 
“Echo of the giants” proposes a system where all actors of the learning process can find relevant tools towards their point of view, but that revolve around the same experience, the game.
These actors are: teachers, parents and students; In addition to educational institutions, which represent the collective interest of teachers. 
Advantages of using ""Echo of the giants"": 



Allows to decouple learning from the mental limits of a classroom or specific hours, because it can be used both inside and outside school. 


Brings the teacher and the concepts closer to the children minds, because with the experiences lived in the video game the teacher can carry out a dialogue in a common field known by both.


It presents an alternative to the classic video games, with great fun, entertainment and educational quality. 


It can be consolidated as an alternative to the grading system, because not only measures the child's performance at a specific moment with a written test, but its development throughout the school year.


PINVED
As we know, the task of parents and teachers is different from the students, so we created a tool called ""Platform for integration of educational video games"" or PINVED (for its acronym in Spanish). 

 
PINVED will allow parents and teachers to participate in the knowledge acquired by the children throughout the game, but with the use of control, supervision and guidance tools. 




PINVED is a web platform that can be used from
any browser. This platform provides different tools for parents and
teachers such as:



Being able to access guidelines for
	parents or teachers that explain the use of the platform and video
	games (in the future there will be more games on the same line).


Control the maximum progress in the game
	of the students in charge, so they don't surpass the teacher
	progress in class.


Detailed charts of the progress of their
	children or students, where the overall progress in the history
	(curriculum) and individual progress by topic (per mini-game) are
	outlined.


Knowing the quantity of successful and
	failed attempts to play each mini-game, representing the progress,
	understanding and affinity the player has of the topic represented
	by it.


Knowing the curricular content of each
	mini-game from the video games which the teacher or parent has an
	active subscription.


Full control over child accounts (for
	parents), which includes parental control over playing time.



 

 

 




The usage mode of the video game ""Echo of
the giants"" is through subscription. The usage mode of ""PINVED""
is free, as long as the subscriber has a subscription to one of the
video game from the platform.







LET'S GET IN AN ADVENTURE TOGETHER


We want to go in an adventure like Ecco of “Echo of the giants”, the future is unknown but the goal is clear, transform the way we and our kids learn, and we want you to go with us. We believe that with this project we open the door to many of us to create and found a new way to learn, where the knowledge matters in the real world and we get prepare to fight the real enemy, the apathy and the ignorance, instead of training to fill papers and test after test. “Echo of the giants” is going to be the first step of many we want to take with you. The idea is to create environments and stories that teach the children not only the basis of science but the basis of our society and how they are useful through the use of their unique set of skills and the knowledge they can get from the world an others, that's why we are betting to use a character (Ecco) whit whom the child and even us can make a travel to rediscover the path our ancestors made to create the society we live nowadays. 
The project is long and will cover the entire school year through repetitive learning reinforcement dynamics, gradual release of events, global goals and a community around the game. It is a task that requires effort and commitment. We want to position the country as an alternative when developing video games. To do so, we need your support. Although we have already received financial support from the national government (developing important parts of the game and the web platform) we need your help to keep delivering the same high quality that we have presented, until the final phase. 
We have currently developed the first part of the first unit and the basis of “Echo of the giants”, as well as the rudiments of the platform PINVED, as was intended at first with the government contribution, but we want to finish the game. The game is going to be formed by 8 units, which represents the topics:




Pre-math concepts (about 9 mini-games)


Numbers until 10 (about 20 mini-games)


Basic adding and subtracting (about 16
	mini-games)


Operations with 3 single-digit numbers
	(about 5 mini-games)


Numbers until 100 (about 10 mini-games)


Advanced adding and subtracting (about 9
	mini-games)


Adding and subtracting with 2-digit
	numbers (about 11 mini-games)


Measurement units (about 15 mini-games)


There are about 100 mini-games just for solely
curricular purposes, but it is intended to have a lot of more
mini-game for fun, objects to collect, comics to read, characters to
know, a lot of exciting options!
It is planned to fulfill the following goals
with your contributions:


Voice acting in both
	English and Spanish for all the texts and dialogues within the game,
	to ease the process of reading to children.


Music and sound effects.


Complete the game
	programming.


Finish the development
	of the platform PINVED both in English and Spanish.


The contributions received are
going to be distributed as follows:


Note that this is a fixed funding campaign, that means “Eco de los gigantes” (Echo of the giants) will only be possible if the goal is reached. When funded, we hope to make the first release of the game 10 months from then.



 

 

“because there's a whole life to play”
see our web page 
Founded in 2015, in the city of Bucaramanga, Colombia; as a product of a persistent idea that materialized as a company. Life2play is a company dedicated to game development and to create complete experiences that embark the viewer in an experience that transcends the screen and the controller, and the mere concept of harmless fun. Created in order to contribute to solving social problems. 
Life2play was conceived in the Universidad Industrial de Santander (UIS), or as in English: Industrial University of Santander.


MISSION


Contribute to the improvement of educational
quality by using innovative techniques in technology, computing and
communication, to create engagement and fun around the learning
process.
VISION

Be a leader in the education field, promoting
the appropriation of one's learning processes, and the inclusion of
all actors in this formative process, through our products and the
creation of our own proposals for education, both nationally and
internationally.
Conceived in 2014, we have gone through many
processes of selection and evaluation by the government of Colombia
to make us worthy of seed capital delivered by the ""Fondo
emprender"", which was given in 2015. The idea was supported by

<p>Hello everyone! We're Prochnost Studios, an indie-team from Moscow. Our numbers are small, but our souls are strong! </p>
<p>We love creativity, in particular how it can be reflected and transformed in computer games. That's why we decided to develop our own game. And today we want to introduce you to our creation. ""Fearsome
Creatures of the Night"" is a dark farytale action/adventure game for Windows &amp; Mac. <b>You can visit our Steam Greenlight concept page <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/fearsome-creatures-of-the-night-the-game/x/11016373#/story"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/fearsome-creatures-of-the-night-the-game/x/11016373#/story"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here (click)</a>!</b></p>
<p>We have no doubt that you want to know why we're collecting money and what the game is about. Well, then read on. And If you like what you see - you can buy one of the perks and support our project!<br/></p>

<p>The concept is based on the stories about so called fearsome creatures, mythical animals from the North American folklore. The story takes place in the dark forest, which is the habitat of these beasts. You play as Jackalope, the rabbit with horns. The protagonist doesn't remember who he is, why he has these strange scars on his chest and what happened. Mysterious Spirit guides you to the center of the woods to ""fulfill your destiny."" Why? What does this spirit want from you? Who are you and what happened with your memory? Try to find out.</p>

<p>
</p>
<p>As we mentioned earlier, in
""Fearsome Creatures of the Night"" you play as Jackalope, a humanoid
rabbit with horns. Your main goal is to reach the forbidden grove in the center
of the woods. Thus says the spirit. ""To fulfill your destiny""... but
what is it?  </p>
<p>At the
beginning the game may look like a pureblood platformer, but we can assure you
that the gameplay is quite unique. It combines many different mechanics with non-standard survival features. Interaction with enemies is very unusual, because you can't attack monsters directly. The protagonist is too weak for that. Although he has some effective tricks to interact with inanimate objects.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435945619/owcutul8ft8w3o3kvq6j.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> You'll need to find other ways and means of interplay with the environment in order not to perish in the mysterious forest. That's why you should be clever to outsmart predators!</p>
<p>So the gameplay is built on the fact that you need to use different ways to
divert attention and sometimes draw it yourself. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">On your way
you'll find a wide variety of monsters with different customs, habits, and even taste preferences. Most of them are not friendly at all. You need to
find a unique approach for each beast.  Find out what attracts them and what scares, apply this knowledge to make them hunt each other, use some monsters for your own purposes to move the story forward. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">For example, let's take this strange creature Tripodero. It may not be easy to anger him, but rather just to get his attention.  His strange appearance and the light that shines through his eye scares predators. It’s handy when you have to go through dangerous areas of the forest.</span></p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Also you can try to find bait to lead monsters into a trap. And that is not the only example of what we’re planning to create. We have tons of ideas and we can assure you that there will be lots of mechanics and tactics to
explore.</span></p>

<p>""The
forest calls you, the smallest and the weakest creature of all.
You WILL reach the forbidden grove deep inside the woods. This is your destiny.
This is your purpose. I say so! But be careful! The forest is inhabited by a
variety of creatures that can kill you in a heartbeat! Use your ingenuity,
distract their attention, lure them into traps or try to find hidden
workarounds - this is your only way to survive!"" </p>
<p>The plot is based on the stories about so called fearsome creatures, mythical animals
from the North American folklore. It all begins at the edge of the dark forest,
which is the habitat of these beasts. You play as Jackalope, the weakest
creature of all. Mysterious spirit guides you and you don't even know why,
because any attempt to remember anything leads nowhere.  And the thing is that Jackalope is the only
creature in the woods, who looks like human. So, your main goal is to reach the
forbidden grove in the center of the woods. Thus says the spirit. ""To
fulfill your destiny""... but what is it? On your way you'll find a wide
variety of monsters, and many of them are not friendly.  What will it be? Can you survive in such
conditions, using the power of you intellect and the aid of a strange spirit? </p>

<p>This is only the beginning of the plot. We have long come up with a scenario and prepared a couple of interesting and unusual twists. The forest is not what it seems at first glance, it is full of stories of lumberjacks who once invaded the center of the woods and awakened some dark force that changed the animals. The story of our hero is full of interesting details, which you will find out for yourself if you play!<br/></p>

<p>“Fearsome
Creatures of the Night” has a dark gothic atmosphere. We needed
a soundtrack that shows the perverse beauty of the game. Acoustic
melodies played on piano, guitars and even ethnic wind instruments, mixed
with occasional splashes of ambient and rhythmic electronics... Just what the doctor ordered. What a joy to know that there's a man in your team capable of creating such a thing!</p>

We have no doubt that you want to know why we're collecting money and what the game is about. Well, then read on. And If you like what you see - you can buy one of the perks and support our project!


The concept is based on the stories about so called fearsome creatures, mythical animals from the North American folklore. The story takes place in the dark forest, which is the habitat of these beasts. You play as Jackalope, the rabbit with horns. The protagonist doesn't remember who he is, why he has these strange scars on his chest and what happened. Mysterious Spirit guides you to the center of the woods to ""fulfill your destiny."" Why? What does this spirit want from you? Who are you and what happened with your memory? Try to find out.







As we mentioned earlier, in
""Fearsome Creatures of the Night"" you play as Jackalope, a humanoid
rabbit with horns. Your main goal is to reach the forbidden grove in the center
of the woods. Thus says the spirit. ""To fulfill your destiny""... but
what is it?  
At the
beginning the game may look like a pureblood platformer, but we can assure you
that the gameplay is quite unique. It combines many different mechanics with non-standard survival features. Interaction with enemies is very unusual, because you can't attack monsters directly. The protagonist is too weak for that. Although he has some effective tricks to interact with inanimate objects.


 You'll need to find other ways and means of interplay with the environment in order not to perish in the mysterious forest. That's why you should be clever to outsmart predators!
So the gameplay is built on the fact that you need to use different ways to
divert attention and sometimes draw it yourself. On your way
you'll find a wide variety of monsters with different customs, habits, and even taste preferences. Most of them are not friendly at all. You need to
find a unique approach for each beast.  Find out what attracts them and what scares, apply this knowledge to make them hunt each other, use some monsters for your own purposes to move the story forward. 

For example, let's take this strange creature Tripodero. It may not be easy to anger him, but rather just to get his attention.  His strange appearance and the light that shines through his eye scares predators. It’s handy when you have to go through dangerous areas of the forest.



Also you can try to find bait to lead monsters into a trap. And that is not the only example of what we’re planning to create. We have tons of ideas and we can assure you that there will be lots of mechanics and tactics to
explore.








""The
forest calls you, the smallest and the weakest creature of all.
You WILL reach the forbidden grove deep inside the woods. This is your destiny.
This is your purpose. I say so! But be careful! The forest is inhabited by a
variety of creatures that can kill you in a heartbeat! Use your ingenuity,
distract their attention, lure them into traps or try to find hidden
workarounds - this is your only way to survive!"" 
The plot is based on the stories about so called fearsome creatures, mythical animals
from the North American folklore. It all begins at the edge of the dark forest,
which is the habitat of these beasts. You play as Jackalope, the weakest
creature of all. Mysterious spirit guides you and you don't even know why,
because any attempt to remember anything leads nowhere.  And the thing is that Jackalope is the only
creature in the woods, who looks like human. So, your main goal is to reach the
forbidden grove in the center of the woods. Thus says the spirit. ""To
fulfill your destiny""... but what is it? On your way you'll find a wide
variety of monsters, and many of them are not friendly.  What will it be? Can you survive in such
conditions, using the power of you intellect and the aid of a strange spirit? 


This is only the beginning of the plot. We have long come up with a scenario and prepared a couple of interesting and unusual twists. The forest is not what it seems at first glance, it is full of stories of lumberjacks who once invaded the center of the woods and awakened some dark force that changed the animals. The story of our hero is full of interesting details, which you will find out for yourself if you play!






“Fearsome
Creatures of the Night” has a dark gothic atmosphere. We needed
a soundtrack that shows the perverse beauty of the game. Acoustic
melodies played on piano, guitars and even ethnic wind instruments, mixed
with occasional splashes of ambient and rhythmic electronics... Just what the doctor ordered. What a joy to know that there's a man in your team capable of creating such a thing!
Here is a small example of the music so you could get an idea about the atmosphere of the game.

The very first test that we're ready to overcome - budget issues. We have no doubt that you want to know how the money will be spent. And especially for this purpose we've prepared a detailed graph.

As you can see, we're going to spend every earned penny on development and bonuses production.
Of course this is not the only obstacle in our way. Currently the game is in the early stages of development. For a long time we've been  developing it on our own, but now we realize that the idea is too big and we need support.
With your help we will improve every aspect of the game, and by that we mean real enhancement. With successful financing it will be possible to develop the game full-time, which will allow us to create:  Beautiful and realistic animation, one of the key points of the right image. Impressive graphics, sound and music, with the ability to record audio at the recording studio.
Unusual gameplay situations that will surprise you during the game. 
We have a clear vision of what ""Fearsome Creatures of the Night"" should be.  And we know perfectly well that it should be a high-quality product. In addition, we're planning to communicate with the community in order to understand what things they would like to see in the game.



If this campaign is successful, estimated release date will be the end of 2015 - beginning of 2016.
   







 
If you can't or don't want to give us your money, you still can help us! Spread the word about the game and this campaign so that other people can learn about it as much as possible! Post stuff about ""Fearsome Creatures of the Night"" on Twitter, VK, Facebook, YouTube, IndieDB or anywhere else (even in the astral plane)! Also you can visit our website, we will be very pleased.We want this game to be something special not only for us, but for all of you! You can help us bring our vision to life, we are counting on it!",15.0,1,"1 Campaign

Crafting the same spell again will raise this spell power. You are collecting spell recipes that describe ingredients and how to gather them right. Used spells can be recharged with power crystals (e.g. on level start).

Need to say here that all world is procedurally generated, so every level start is not like previous. You will not find NPC second time, instead found another NPC with another quest. The random will have a prediction to control a story canvas, but my idea is to make it various as possible.

<p>Thank you for stopping by and checking out Rumblers! First of all, I would love to say welcome and I hope you enjoy my project. After months of figuring out how to code I have finally been able to put together an idea I've had for a very long time. Being a father of two beautiful girls doesn't really allow for dedicated time but with planning (during their nap/sleep time) I was able to submerge myself into the world of Rumblers. First released on a browser, users are able to connect with others and battle to be number one. It has always been my thing to allow my creation to be enjoyed with friends/family, so play with up to Six(6) Players in a Free-for-All Battle to be Crowned the Winner. If you are feeling risky you can also jump into our live matchmaking system that connects you to players all around the world. After the release, I began to discover issues that are fixes and improvements needed for Rumblers that I, unfortunately, can not correct by myself. In search of a solution, I am reaching out to all video game lovers around the world to give a helping hand in making this project really come to life.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and I hope to connect with you soon! </p>

<p>After the release of the first build I have realized many options that I will have to complete in order to give the player the full experience I have envisioned  </p>
<p>Break down of my Road-Map of Rumblers:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Stage #1</strong>: Stabilize Rumblers Base coding with all features tested and added for user end experience. During these stages we will attach a downloadable desktop version to allow user to easily connect to the Rumblers Environment. </li>
<li>
<strong>Stage #2:</strong> Added Networking System that allows users to create an Account and save their progress. During these stages players will be able to track their wins/losses and have access to leader boards, earn custom skins and work on their player profile rank. </li>
<li>
<strong>Stage #3:</strong> After completion of the first and second stages, we will begin to build up our players feature list including cross-platform formatting, giving access to iOS &amp; Android Playable. Also adding Maps &amp; Weapons to the game which will open custom weapons skins for players.</li>
<li>
<strong>Stage #4:</strong> Upgrade Servers to increase performance for end users which will provide servers access all around the world for reduced pinging and engineer next level networking coding and web sockets to improve overall game-play. </li>

</div></div>","Thank you for stopping by and checking out Rumblers! First of all, I would love to say welcome and I hope you enjoy my project. After months of figuring out how to code I have finally been able to put together an idea I've had for a very long time. Being a father of two beautiful girls doesn't really allow for dedicated time but with planning (during their nap/sleep time) I was able to submerge myself into the world of Rumblers. First released on a browser, users are able to connect with others and battle to be number one. It has always been my thing to allow my creation to be enjoyed with friends/family, so play with up to Six(6) Players in a Free-for-All Battle to be Crowned the Winner. If you are feeling risky you can also jump into our live matchmaking system that connects you to players all around the world. After the release, I began to discover issues that are fixes and improvements needed for Rumblers that I, unfortunately, can not correct by myself. In search of a solution, I am reaching out to all video game lovers around the world to give a helping hand in making this project really come to life.
Thank you for your time and I hope to connect with you soon! 
 


After the release of the first build I have realized many options that I will have to complete in order to give the player the full experience I have envisioned  
Break down of my Road-Map of Rumblers:


Stage #1: Stabilize Rumblers Base coding with all features tested and added for user end experience. During these stages we will attach a downloadable desktop version to allow user to easily connect to the Rumblers Environment. 

Stage #2: Added Networking System that allows users to create an Account and save their progress. During these stages players will be able to track their wins/losses and have access to leader boards, earn custom skins and work on their player profile rank. 

Stage #3: After completion of the first and second stages, we will begin to build up our players feature list including cross-platform formatting, giving access to iOS & Android Playable. Also adding Maps & Weapons to the game which will open custom weapons skins for players.

Stage #4: Upgrade Servers to increase performance for end users which will provide servers access all around the world for reduced pinging and engineer next level networking coding and web sockets to improve overall game-play. 
 



Your support during this process is critical in hiring an extra set of professionals to accomplish our end results game. I understand helping could be challenging and hard but any little bit can take us to that next stage.  



 


Understand Early Access games can be a little worrisome to supporters/players as they seem to not hold their word on things during the process of development. I ensure you that you will always have a direct connection with myself or someone else on the Rumblers Team. All questions and concerns will be answered on a personal level and we will provide every form of communication to connect to the team.

Our goal is to have you finding new and interesting strategies after hundreds of runs. You'll be taking on new challenges hundreds of hours in and making the craziest thing happen at 2am when you should be asleep instead of playing Auto Blobs, what are you doing? Go to bed!</p><p>In Auto Blobs you’ll begin as a rookie blob strategist with a small team of starter blobs. As you progress through the game you will upgrade your team, buy new blobs and items from shops and deck out your team to fight harder and harder groups of enemies.

Here’s a few of the many, many, ideas we have so far:</p><ul>
<li>Eternity Orb: This unit’s remaining mana at the end of a round is stored in this items (To be added next battle).</li>
<li>Stop Sign: Whenever a unit uses their ability they are stunned for 2 seconds.</li>

</div></div>","*New rewards are being unlocked by the community as we progress along the stretch goals*   Leecher is a 2D multigenre side scroller game with complex physics based mechanics.    Inspired by games like Trine and Limbo, Leecher will keep two core principles to its end: puzzle solving and one punch death.    As for the rest, the gameplay will entirely depend on its six progress stages.     At each stage you will have to master a new character that has its own unique mechanics and a different scheme of visual perception.   The action takes place in the distant future on a faraway planet. For a long time its climate remained unchanged, that allowed for evolution to flourish. Many bizarre creatures emerged.     You are one of them - a symbiote that is able to connect to the central nervous system of other organisms. The nature arround you is unstable so you have to start a long wander through the unnown places and substances in order to find a new home...    It is the leecher, who creates the logic of characters changes.   You will witness through the eyes of different creatures how the emergence of such an organism as a leecher imprinted on the evolution of all living beings and humanoids community.   You will face the force that shattered the fragile structure of the planetary ecosystem and brought it into motion.""The Climber""     This creature is a terrestrial being that is able to jump onto ceilings and walls and climb on or up them. The gameplay will test your reaction and the ability to solve spatial tasks of low and medium complexity.  It has a simple black and white vision with lowered level of detail.  “The Crowd Fish""     It is an aquatic being. The mechanics of this character are based on the interaction with the fish shoal. You will have to be very observant and watch the behavior of other fishes to know when the shoal is ready to follow your actions, and when it is frightened. By ignoring its state and sacrificing your comrades in vain, you will significantly complicate advancing to further levels.  It has a full color vision with the emphasis on the shoal insight and with a distortion of the above-water space.   “The Bat""     This character is volant and belongs to the most dynamic part of the game. You will struggle with gravity and hunt on various fauna specimen .  This creature has a high contrast vision with low depth of field and a threats color differentiation.  “The Cow""     A terrestrial being that can walk, lie down, and chew. Primarily, it is needded for a slight relaxation.  Its vision has saturated colors with a tilted balance.  “The Colony Master”     It is a subterranean being that can’t move by itself, but has an ability to control a colony of giant insects. Various classes of units will be at your disposal. It would be up to you to decide which units to raise, how to defend and what to conquer. This character will add real-time strategy elements of “rock-paper-scissors” classical type.  This characters display area will have a “friend-foe” color identification and a fuzzy projection of orders and actions.  “The Spider”     It is a terrestrial being. Its gaming stage will contain the highest number of puzzles. The mechanics features the ability to use the web to move, interact with objects and create complex spatial constructions.  The creature is able to see low-frequency radiation.   As a rule, stretch goals are accompanied with additional game content (new levels, weapons, characters, monsters, etc.). Having studied a great number of projects, I noticed that this extension is not always beneficial.     So I decided that I wouldn’t risk the quality of the game by promising the content I'm not certain about.     However, the selected model of the campaign engenders the condition under the fulfillment of which the release of the game might undergo a minor modification - if the raised funds are less than 132k the game will be created in two chapters and will be delivered with a time gap.     The structure of the rewards has also undergone changes.

Have you ever played 2048 puzzle game? Well we have and we saw so much more potential in this exciting game! And this project is the effort to realize what we have envisioned as a new simple yet engaging puzzle game inspired by 2048.
In monster square, we maintain the simple and direct game play experience yet at the same time we introduce much more depth in strategy, goal orientation and rewards of the game itself.


A standard board for is 4x4, We are introducing a 4x5 board to the game with added twist to engage players in a different game experience. 




Instead of numbers, we use monsters and evolution phases to enhance game experience. What's more exciting is that the monsters are collectibles through completion of requirements. We encourage players to go and unlock the many different monsters available in game. Each monster type has 12 levels of progression.




We are introducing objective and stages into the game. With this, player does not only strive for higher points, at the same time player has to think of different strategies to complete the requirements on each stages.




We are introducing obstacles to the game for more excitement! There are many obstacles with different attributes and effects that will disturb the movement or progression of the monster on the board.




To balance out the obstacle, we created monster canon. This can help players remove status effects, level up their monsters and eliminate obstacles. The canon is charged with combo points until it's ready to be triggered.




Share your high scores with your friends on your social network! 




The first phase of the game will be released solely on Android, as free to play.




 Goals note:
Time Attack mode: Unlock time attack game play mode aside from normal mode.
Extreme Survival mode: Unlock survival mode where we will include all the chances of obstacles appearing during game.
Monster Skills: It has been our ambitious plan to include this big feature where all the monsters set will have specific unique skills to help players in game.

Then your opponent can play Characters or Upgrade cards and then… well you got the point.

<p>FISH is first person shooter with old-school gameplay inspired by games like DOOM, Duke Nukem 3D and Quake. It has handcrafted levels with non-linear structures and secrets, like we used to have in the 90s. And here's the hook:</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.homembarata.com.br/8ah/images/gogogif3.gif"" src=""""/> </p>
<p>Literally, you have a hook that can be used to travel the map and pull stuff.</p>
<p>And the enemies are fishmen. Not any fishmen, they're pirate fishmen! Captain Black Whiskers and his crew have taken over the tropical island of San Esteban, all seemed lost until a hero showed up to help the resistance: The Pescador! A strong,hairy and shirtless fisherman with a hook in his right hand and an unknown past. With his (and your) help, the resistance can defeat the pirates and take the island back!</p>
<p>Aside from the classic 90's FPS, FISH also takes a lot of inspiration from pirate movies, One Piece and a brazillian soap opera from the early 2000's called Kubanacan.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>Good question. I'm Arthur ""Tuba"" Zeferino, I'm a huge fan of 90's classic FPS and I want to help bringing back the FPS genre to it's roots. Anyway, I've been working with games in Brazil since 2008, working as a programmer on a bunch of simpler games like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_xlI4jTEMI"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Three Stooges: Treasure Hunt Hijinks</a> and <a href=""https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/rklL5teCbYd4hamaZ8VQxaiY2rBTgk89"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Satisfashion DS</a>. A few years ago I decided I should work on a game that I would want to play and so here I am. </p>
<p>I'm also one of the founders of the brazilian gaming website <a href=""http://www.gamesfoda.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">GAMESFODA</a> and spent the last few years writing reviews and articles about games and game design. If you don't speak portuguese and want to know some of that work, check these game design articles I've wrote for Gamasutra:</p>

<p>- <strong>Old school action!</strong> Lots of bullets hitting stuff, exploding barrels, big enemies and all that good stuff.</p>
<p>- <strong>A hookshot!</strong> It can be used to travel the map, pull enemies and items and some other cool stuff.</p>
<p>-<strong> Exploration!</strong> Remember having to explore the maps in DOOM? Remember finding those sweet secret areas and levels? I hope you like that because we're doing it here.</p>
<p>- <strong>Dynamic soundtrack full of rhythm!</strong> FISH's soundtrack changes according to the action on the screen and is being composed by the talented guys at <a href=""http://estudiocafofo.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Cafofo Studio</a> in Rio, it's a mix of jazz and samba, giving the game an unique feeling. </p>
<p>- <strong>Cartoony artstyle mixing 2D and 3D. </strong>Miss sprites? We have that! Like 3D graphics? We have that too! And also, colors! Lots of them!</p>
<p>- <strong>Humor! </strong>FISH is supposed to be fun, so don't take it seriously, enjoy the jokes and the violence against fishmen pirates!</p>
<p><strong>- Unreal Engine 4 </strong>- FISH is being developed using the noble and pedigreed middleware from Epic Games.</p>

<p>The story is not the focus in FISH, in fact it's totally skippable if you prefer. But there are a few characters to add some flavor to the game:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507297832/l6p9wgwgahz7cjhjmj4x.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>No one knows where he came from and he doesn't remember either. Only known as The Pescador (the fisherman), Rubí found him stranded at a beach and helped him recover. He's very skillful with firearms and his hook can absorb power from fishmen scales. Don't like wearing shirts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507297909/xbyicx8ciodhbvyizjjg.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The leader of the resistance, a woman in her 60s, respected by everyone and kinda cranky. She found the Pescador lost at the beach and took care of him, a mother figure of some sorts. Now she's responsible to think about strategies and send him in missions. Curses a lot.</p>

<p>I've been cooking fish for many years now. A lot of people have ate my fish and all of them survived [citation needed]. So not only I'm sharing some spicy details about the game development, but I'm sharing all my special fish recipes! Tuna, cod, sardines, salmon, anchovies and many others! Fried, grilled, boiled, spicy, raw, sweet, sour, rotten, you'll become a fish cooking master chef in no time with great recipes like this one:</p> <p><strong>Grilled sardine:<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507299404/vcclmyr4t3qlujybcjm8.png"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/></strong></p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fresh sardine</li>
<li> Thyme</li>
<li> Rosemary</li>
<li> Black Pepper</li>
<li> Salt</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Prepare:</strong></p>
<p>Season the sardines with all the ingredients mentioned (except the sardine itself, that doesn't even make sense) and let the flavors sink in for about an hour.</p>
<p>Light up your grill or frying pan until it's very hot, add a little olive oil so your fish don't stick and put the sardines with the skin facing down. The exact time depends on your equipment but since this is a small fish, it should be quick. Turn it over when the meat gets all whitish, leave it for a few more minutes to get some color and it's done!</p>
<p>Eat. </p>

<p>Sadly, music is an often overlooked (overheard?) part of a game. But here we take it very seriously. The music is being composed side by side with the game's development by the talented fellows at <a href=""https://www.estudiocafofo.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Cafofo Studio</a>, it's a mix of samba-rock and bebop jazz, rhythms that are not heard in games very often.</p>

<p>Yeah, I'm not doing stretch goals. I can't promise more levels, console versions or anything like that because that wouldn't require just more money but also more time. So any extra money will be put into hiring freelancers to help with the game, getting better equipment for development, hiring voice actors and things like that to make sure we can deliver the best possible product to you;</p>

<p><strong>Q. I wanna help but I'm short on cash, what can I do?</strong></p>
<p>A. Thanks for your consideration but keep your money. Tell about the game to your friends, share this page on your social networks, that helps a lot.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q. No console version? :(</strong></p>
<p>A. First we want to focus on the best game possible that can be played on a PC/Mac/Linux because that's where most DOOM and Quake fans are. But I would love to port it to consoles, all of them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q. So no controller support on PC?</strong></p>
<p>A. FISH has full controller support on PC, we're making sure that players who prefer to play it like that can also enjoy the game.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q. 2019? Really?</strong></p>
<p>A. These things take time and I wanna make sure you're getting the best possible product. But I'll keep you updated.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q. How many maps will this thing have?</strong></p>
<p>A. 16 (with some secret ones).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q. Will FISH have multiplayer?</strong></p>
<p>A. No. Sorry, but making a single player mode is already a lot of work and I want to focus on that. But the good news is that there are plenty of good new FPS with multiplayer out there, have you played DOOM? Quake Champions? DUSK? Lawbreakers?  Unreal Tournament 4? They're cool.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q. Why IndieGogo?</strong></p>
<p>A. Honest answer? Because the competition doesn't accept projects from Brazil.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q. If you're from Brazil, Why not use a brazillian service that use BRL as currency?</strong></p>
<p>A. Great question. As you can see by the language being used here, I'm not making a game just for brazillian fellows but for the whole world. Brazilian services are quite restricted and by choosing Indiegogo, FPS fans from the whole world can help. Anyway, if you're brazilian (or american or from anywhere actually) and you can't afford an international credit card or a paypal account, you can still help by sharing the campaign on your Facebook, Twitter or social network of your preference, tell your friends about it! Use that money to buy some milk, a sandwich or some sardines and do the recipe above, enjoy yourself! </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q. I'm not brazilian and I've heard there are some brazilian pop culture references in it. Will I be able to enjoy it?</strong></p>
<p>A. Yes. FISH has indeed a lot of brazilian pop culture references but I'm trying to make something that everyone can enjoy. So, there'll be adaptations to the most obscure references in every language, don't worry about it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q. I'm vegan, can I still enjoy the artcookbook?</strong></p>
<p>A. Yes! You can look at the pretty pictures, use it to hold your door, use it as a cup mat, it has many functions!! Also, there will be some vegan fish recipes in there. What's a vegan fish? I don't know, but I'll look into it and tell you all about it in the book!</p>

Note: This is a demo of a game in production so it will definitely have a few bugs, sorry for the inconvenience. If you find any please report it so I can fix it. The demo will be updated during the campaign, fixing bugs and changing according to player feedback so don't be shy to leave your  constructive comments.
 

FISH is first person shooter with old-school gameplay inspired by games like DOOM, Duke Nukem 3D and Quake. It has handcrafted levels with non-linear structures and secrets, like we used to have in the 90s. And here's the hook:
 
Literally, you have a hook that can be used to travel the map and pull stuff.
And the enemies are fishmen. Not any fishmen, they're pirate fishmen! Captain Black Whiskers and his crew have taken over the tropical island of San Esteban, all seemed lost until a hero showed up to help the resistance: The Pescador! A strong,hairy and shirtless fisherman with a hook in his right hand and an unknown past. With his (and your) help, the resistance can defeat the pirates and take the island back!
Aside from the classic 90's FPS, FISH also takes a lot of inspiration from pirate movies, One Piece and a brazillian soap opera from the early 2000's called Kubanacan.
 
 

Good question. I'm Arthur ""Tuba"" Zeferino, I'm a huge fan of 90's classic FPS and I want to help bringing back the FPS genre to it's roots. Anyway, I've been working with games in Brazil since 2008, working as a programmer on a bunch of simpler games like The Three Stooges: Treasure Hunt Hijinks and Satisfashion DS. A few years ago I decided I should work on a game that I would want to play and so here I am. 
I'm also one of the founders of the brazilian gaming website GAMESFODA and spent the last few years writing reviews and articles about games and game design. If you don't speak portuguese and want to know some of that work, check these game design articles I've wrote for Gamasutra:
The Influences and Differences of Team Fortress 2 Classes and Overwatch HeroesThe storytelling in Undertale's combat system
 
And this video about Quake's E1M3 level design (turn the captions on for english):


 

 
But I can understand if that's not enough for you to trust me with your money, that's why I have a demo. Check it out and decide for yourself!
 
 


- Old school action! Lots of bullets hitting stuff, exploding barrels, big enemies and all that good stuff.
- A hookshot! It can be used to travel the map, pull enemies and items and some other cool stuff.
- Exploration! Remember having to explore the maps in DOOM? Remember finding those sweet secret areas and levels? I hope you like that because we're doing it here.
- Dynamic soundtrack full of rhythm! FISH's soundtrack changes according to the action on the screen and is being composed by the talented guys at Cafofo Studio in Rio, it's a mix of jazz and samba, giving the game an unique feeling. 
- Cartoony artstyle mixing 2D and 3D. Miss sprites? We have that! Like 3D graphics? We have that too! And also, colors! Lots of them!
- Humor! FISH is supposed to be fun, so don't take it seriously, enjoy the jokes and the violence against fishmen pirates!
- Unreal Engine 4 - FISH is being developed using the noble and pedigreed middleware from Epic Games.
 

The story is not the focus in FISH, in fact it's totally skippable if you prefer. But there are a few characters to add some flavor to the game:
 

No one knows where he came from and he doesn't remember either. Only known as The Pescador (the fisherman), Rubí found him stranded at a beach and helped him recover. He's very skillful with firearms and his hook can absorb power from fishmen scales. Don't like wearing shirts.
 

The leader of the resistance, a woman in her 60s, respected by everyone and kinda cranky. She found the Pescador lost at the beach and took care of him, a mother figure of some sorts. Now she's responsible to think about strategies and send him in missions. Curses a lot.
 

A mad scientist that help the fishmen with her technology, as long as the Captain allow her to continue with her researches. The only human that Black Whiskers respect.
 

An old ruthless pirate that sees the humans as an inferior species. No one knows he's true intentions on the island.
 

Black Whiskers' very large crew. Has some of the most peculiar and dangerous pirates of any species.
 

I've been cooking fish for many years now. A lot of people have ate my fish and all of them survived [citation needed]. So not only I'm sharing some spicy details about the game development, but I'm sharing all my special fish recipes! Tuna, cod, sardines, salmon, anchovies and many others! Fried, grilled, boiled, spicy, raw, sweet, sour, rotten, you'll become a fish cooking master chef in no time with great recipes like this one: Grilled sardine:
Ingredients:

Fresh sardine
 Thyme
 Rosemary
 Black Pepper
 Salt

 
Prepare:
Season the sardines with all the ingredients mentioned (except the sardine itself, that doesn't even make sense) and let the flavors sink in for about an hour.
Light up your grill or frying pan until it's very hot, add a little olive oil so your fish don't stick and put the sardines with the skin facing down. The exact time depends on your equipment but since this is a small fish, it should be quick. Turn it over when the meat gets all whitish, leave it for a few more minutes to get some color and it's done!
Eat.

Sadly, music is an often overlooked (overheard?) part of a game. But here we take it very seriously. The music is being composed side by side with the game's development by the talented fellows at Cafofo Studio, it's a mix of samba-rock and bebop jazz, rhythms that are not heard in games very often.
Listen:



Yeah, I'm not doing stretch goals. I can't promise more levels, console versions or anything like that because that wouldn't require just more money but also more time. So any extra money will be put into hiring freelancers to help with the game, getting better equipment for development, hiring voice actors and things like that to make sure we can deliver the best possible product to you;

 


The Art/Cookbook - Details above, but basically it's art-book AND a cook-book with some seafood recipes!

You somewhere in the game! - The island of San Esteban is full of buildings and these buildings are full of pictures, paintings, magazines and other stuff with people printed on them. And you can be one of those people! As a person or as a fish, why not?

<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">2015 marks the 30th anniversary of the Evindale fantasy RPG setting and we'd like to bring it to life with a new, lightweight rules system made specifically for live action roleplay.</span></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What is the setting?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Sagas is set in the dying world of Evindale, in the tribal,nation of Sta'abri.  Surrounded by the remnants of civilizations destroyed by a cataclysmic event known as the Interregnum, the tribes of Sta'abri fared both better and worse than their neighbors.</p>
<p>Unlike others who relied upon now-dead gods, the people of Sta'abri returned to their roots and sought power and assistance from the underlying force behind all life: the eight Elements.  They were not the only one to do so, however.</p>
<p>""Incursion"" finds you, the cast character, as a representative of one of four tribes -- the healing Water-based River Elk, the violent Fire-fueled Dead Claw, the deadly Moon-powered Snow Leopards, or the oracular Sun-fed White Bison -- who have come together to discuss their future against the Sadrith Mar, an invading force of slavers who may have found the secret of uniting (or destroying) the Elements.</p>
<p>With the Mar on your heels, the tribes must work together to survive.  Even as you meet, scouts of the Mar head your way and behind them, those that would erase your existence, your Saga, from the world.<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>No theatrical event can be had without its cast and audience.  That's you.</p>
<p>If funded, Sagas will have a home and insurance in October for its first Open Beta event, ""Incursion"", a dramatic recreation of an important historical event within the dying world of Evindale.  Where the story goes from there, like all of Sagas, is entirely up to you: the cast member.</p>
<p>If you fund at the <b>Caffeine Supporter</b> level, you'll get a mighty thanks from us on our website as one of the almighty Gods of Support on our Sagas website, <a dir=""ltr"" href=""http://sagaslarp.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">sagaslarp.com</a></p>
<p>If you fund at any of the <b>Preregistration</b> levels, you will be able to participate as a preregistered member in the October Incursion event.</p> </div> <div> <h3>How you bring Sagas to life</h3>
<div>Sagas is designed to be theatrical and immersive, allowing you lose yourself for over 36 hours straight in a fictitious world over the course of a weekend.  To make it so fully immersive, If funded, Sagas will use this meager funding to:</div> <ul> <li><b>Run the October event!</b></li>
<li>Rent a<b> venue</b>
</li>
<li>Purchase <b>liability insurance</b>
</li>
<li>Get much needed <b>office materials</b> such as printer paper, toner, and envelopes for character sheets and rules packets; small props such as the game's currency, ""Fragments""; and minimal makeup for Dedicated Cast characters.</li> </ul>
<div>Once we reach our goal, you can help us reach our <b>stretch goals </b>to create an even livelier and immersive environment.  This includes:</div>
<div><ul>
<li><span><b>Storage unit --</b> In order for Sagas to grow, we want to make a permanent home, and that means building a much needed storage unit so we can grow and expand your game.</span></li>
<li>
<span><b>Better costuming</b> for incidental Directed Cast (NPCs) which means a more believable  atmosphere</span><br/>
</li>
<li><span><b>Better props</b> -- Sagas doesn't use Item Tags for all things.  Being immersive, we wish to provide you with actual items, not just flimsy pieces of paper that are supposed to represent some potent magical item</span></li>
<li><span><b>Special effects </b>-- Fog, smoke, lights, LEDs, specially crafted monster costumes, spectacular props, and more to enhance your experience.</span></li>
</ul></div> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>There's no risk to you if we're not funded for this event.  To ensure our goals are realistic, we've identified those needs we know for a fact we can meet.</p> <ul> <li>The rules system has been modified based on player suggestions from our May 2015 play test event, and from meetings held nearly every month since.  <b>We listen.</b>
</li> <li>
<b>Artwork</b> in printed and web material is always needed.  Fortunately, Raven's Head Productions, LLC engages in other events that yielded artistic contacts.  Already, we've engaged their high-quality business for some of the tribe logos and plan to continue.</li>
<li>

</div></div>","Bring Sagas to Life! Sagas a new live action roleplaying game and this funding supports the occurrence of the Open Beta event October 16-18, 2015 in Vernon, NJ by securing venue rental, insurance, and basic supplies.
2015 marks the 30th anniversary of the Evindale fantasy RPG setting and we'd like to bring it to life with a new, lightweight rules system made specifically for live action roleplay.

What is the setting?

Sagas is set in the dying world of Evindale, in the tribal,nation of Sta'abri.  Surrounded by the remnants of civilizations destroyed by a cataclysmic event known as the Interregnum, the tribes of Sta'abri fared both better and worse than their neighbors.
Unlike others who relied upon now-dead gods, the people of Sta'abri returned to their roots and sought power and assistance from the underlying force behind all life: the eight Elements.  They were not the only one to do so, however.
""Incursion"" finds you, the cast character, as a representative of one of four tribes -- the healing Water-based River Elk, the violent Fire-fueled Dead Claw, the deadly Moon-powered Snow Leopards, or the oracular Sun-fed White Bison -- who have come together to discuss their future against the Sadrith Mar, an invading force of slavers who may have found the secret of uniting (or destroying) the Elements.
With the Mar on your heels, the tribes must work together to survive.  Even as you meet, scouts of the Mar head your way and behind them, those that would erase your existence, your Saga, from the world.    What We Need & What You Get No theatrical event can be had without its cast and audience.  That's you.
If funded, Sagas will have a home and insurance in October for its first Open Beta event, ""Incursion"", a dramatic recreation of an important historical event within the dying world of Evindale.  Where the story goes from there, like all of Sagas, is entirely up to you: the cast member.
If you fund at the Caffeine Supporter level, you'll get a mighty thanks from us on our website as one of the almighty Gods of Support on our Sagas website, sagaslarp.com
If you fund at any of the Preregistration levels, you will be able to participate as a preregistered member in the October Incursion event.   How you bring Sagas to life
Sagas is designed to be theatrical and immersive, allowing you lose yourself for over 36 hours straight in a fictitious world over the course of a weekend.  To make it so fully immersive, If funded, Sagas will use this meager funding to:  Run the October event!
Rent a venue

Purchase liability insurance

Get much needed office materials such as printer paper, toner, and envelopes for character sheets and rules packets; small props such as the game's currency, ""Fragments""; and minimal makeup for Dedicated Cast characters. 
Once we reach our goal, you can help us reach our stretch goals to create an even livelier and immersive environment.  This includes:

Storage unit -- In order for Sagas to grow, we want to make a permanent home, and that means building a much needed storage unit so we can grow and expand your game.

Better costuming for incidental Directed Cast (NPCs) which means a more believable  atmosphere

Better props -- Sagas doesn't use Item Tags for all things.  Being immersive, we wish to provide you with actual items, not just flimsy pieces of paper that are supposed to represent some potent magical item
Special effects -- Fog, smoke, lights, LEDs, specially crafted monster costumes, spectacular props, and more to enhance your experience.
   Risks & Challenges There's no risk to you if we're not funded for this event.  To ensure our goals are realistic, we've identified those needs we know for a fact we can meet.  The rules system has been modified based on player suggestions from our May 2015 play test event, and from meetings held nearly every month since.  We listen.
 
Artwork in printed and web material is always needed.  Fortunately, Raven's Head Productions, LLC engages in other events that yielded artistic contacts.  Already, we've engaged their high-quality business for some of the tribe logos and plan to continue.

If you contribute but then can't make it, we will gladly apply any bonus and purchased Service Point rewards to your character so it may be spent on your character the next time you attend, in addition to any purchased SP from that attended game.    Other Ways You Can Help Sagas is more than money.  You will be part of a growing community of enthusiasts who may wish to contribute in other ways.  From crafting props to joining our storytelling team, we can always use the help in some fashion.

<p>TRUMP'ED consists of 36 quotes, and counting, taken from throughout Trump's career and his recent presidential campaign as well as other historical leaders including Hitler, Saddam and more... </p>
<p>The quotes are scored for Ego, Racism, Sexism, Anti-Democratic Factor, Number of Followers and Net Worth, culminating in a final computed Dictator score.</p>
<h3>Here's how it works </h3>
<p>Each quote is rated on a scale of 1 - 10 (Low - High) for Ego, Racism, Sexism and Anti-Democracy. Scores are currently being crowd sourced and the final scores will be determined at the end of this campaign. If you would like to contribute to scoring the quotes you will be able to on our website shortly.</p>
<p>The number of followers is an estimate based on publicly available information and is calculated as the sum of Trumps book sales, Apprentice TV viewing figures, Twitter followers and the proportion of the Republican Party nomination at the time of the quote. We have used a equivalent method for quotes where the above are not relevant (<i>i.e</i>., for historical characters). </p>
<p>Trump's estimated net worth is derived from an average of valuations provide by Forbes magazine rich list and Trump's own public declarations of wealth.</p>
<p>The Dictator Score is a dynamic score calculated as follows: (Ego + Racism + Sexism + Anti-democratic factor) X (# Followers (Millions) + Net Worth (Billions) = Dictator Score </p>
<p>All quotes have been checked by our team to ensure accuracy and references will be provided on our website soon. We are always happy hear about new, or old, quotes of a similar nature.</p>
<h3>How to play </h3>
<p>TRUMP'ED is a game for 2 - 6 players and the rules are simple. The object of the game is to be crowned Trump by winning all the cards.</p>
<ul>
<li>Deal equal cards face down to each player</li>
<li>Player to the left of the dealer starts by turning over the top card and reading the quote in their best Trump fashion</li>
<li>The player then chooses a trait and reads out the value to the other players </li>
<li>The other players then turn over the top card </li>
<li> The player with the highest value wins all the cards for that round </li>
<li>If there is a draw, the cards go into the center and the players who drew battle again, using new cards and the same trait</li>
<li>The player who won the previous round starts the next round </li>
<li>When you run out of cards you have been TRUMP'ED </li>
</ul>
<p>Warning: playing under the effects of alcohol may lead to uncontrolled bouts of aggression, high blood pressure, nausea, vomiting and in extreme cases death. Please leave your guns outside.</p>
<h3>Where we're at</h3>
<h4>Card Design </h4>
<p>The card designs are complete, although minor alterations may occur between now and the release date depending on feedback. Prototypes have been printed to check for quality. Where possible we want to use public domain or Creative Commons images under BY-SA 2.0 licences. Some images, which improve the design and look of the game, are copyright protected. We will attain all relevant copyrights for any images used and make all required attributions before publication of any images.</p>
<p>The concept for the packaging has been created. The designs are in progress. We will keep you updated.

<p>Our primary product is the TRUMP'ED game. However, in light of this year's presidential nomination we decided to commemorate the occasion with t-shirts, caps, and more.</p>
<p>If our campaign is successful we will bring out a range of t-shirts and caps in the red, white and blue with multiple designs. </p>
<p><b>Website</b></p>
<p>The website is currently is development. It should be ready very soon. We will keep you posted on developments.</p>
<h3>What's next </h3>
<p>We are in a bit of a conundrum at Hypocrite Games; if Trump goes all the way to the White House we continue to get new content leading to extend editions and expansion packs, maybe another 4 years worth; can you imagine!</p>
<p>We at Hypocrite Games are putting measures into place to ensure this doesn't happen with the paradoxical publication of TRUMP'ED the game.</p>
<p>If all goes well we intend to release different games, both physical and virtual, with a mobile version of TRUMP'ED already under conceptualization . Another time and another campaign. </p>

We have chosen not to display these images at present for obvious reasons. If any one has suitable images they would allow to be used please send them to hello@trumped.cards.</p>
<p>There is also inherent risk from Mr Trump himself. Hypocrite Games LLC has been set up solely to complete the fulfillment within the US, EU and Canada. Mr Trump is well known to protect his ""$3 Billion"" brand, regularly suing potential threats .

Our team has made every attempt to ensure the quotes are accurate and the information has not been trumped-up. </p>
<p>The scoring is crowd sourced, calculated from public information and or computed; mitigating any risk of defamation. However, in light of the publicity such an event would bring we are not sure if this is a risk or an advantage.</p>
<p>Risk are also associated with the name TRUMP'ED and obtaining and defending the registered trademark.

<p>We do have suppliers and distributors ready in the USA and EU. Issues may arise in the future depending on the supply chain, demand and logistics.</p>

Hypocrite Games has committed to donating 5% of the revenues from the 1st edition of TRUMP'ED to charitable causes. That works out at $0.50 for every $10 raised. We estimate this calculates to 25% of gross profit. We prefer to give this charitable donation from revenues to ensure profits can not be downgraded and the charities get zero. We wish to, and may still give, a larger proportion to charity however we would like to have some funds in reserve in case we come into difficulties downstream.</p>

<h2>Story and universe</h2>
<p>Many years have passed since humanity first left the surface of its mother planet Earth and decided to explore the sky. And did not stop there. Driven by the overpopulation of the planet and the desire for knowledge, for centuries of failure it has became possible to uncover the secrets of space travel.</p>
<p>New worlds, new resources have been discovered. And it is in human nature to fight for these. Whole empires were created and subsequently disappeared, pushed out by neighbors, or destroyed from within. In addition, rumors of an aggressive, extraterrestrial race that invaded the peripheral worlds have appeared. When these rumors turned into a real manace and threat to the human race as whole, most of the quarrelled factions began to talk about an alliance, although temporary.</p>
<p>This is how the Confederacy arose, which is present to this day. Quantas of newly emerging confederation currency began to flow into common funds. In addition to building a common infrastructure, a vast logistics and defensive positions around the core of the sector, a considerable amount of money was spent to finance the new Keepers project.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1553956821/dvie4xnbdj9apio0lipg.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The Keepers program trains the most talented pilots in the sector and transforms them into elite unit members. These pilots do not specialize in only one type of spacecraft, because of their training and talent, they control all available classes. They are experts in both weapons and defense systems, engineering and they are strategy expets who master the maneuvering of the ship. The graduates of this program is referred to as the Keepers and are widely deployed on battlefields as a strategic advisor and moral boost. In similar rate in secret and sabotage operations (black ops).</p>
<p>Not much is known about the program. The information is intentionally concealed to the public and deliberately misrepresented. Rumors say that immoral practices such as cybernetic and genetic experiments on cadets are also covered. Apparently to get the best out of the subjects. Which allegedly leads to frequent departures and, more often, cadets' deaths. The program only completes the strongest. However, it seems to fulfill its purpose ...</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The game</h2>
<p>As outlined above, this is a multiplayer space game where the player is a pilot. He flies a spaceship and tries to shoot down other players or fight the environment (PvE and PvP).</p>
<p>AFK´s destination platform is PC, for now.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1553956599/fgvzqnoqhc58qoidwvfh.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The main element of the game is dynamics. Everything starts with selecting a game type (* Chapters: ""What to expect in the future"", ""Game modes"") and then selecting a map. Each map is more or less generated by a pseudo-random. E.g. asteroid clusters of different sizes and speeds are created as well as their predefined count. This ensures a more dynamics to the game, as there are no specialized places where players can use the environment (such as camping) to their unfair advantage. This also makes every map unique.</p>
<p>Players join the host and select the type/class of spaceship. Each is specific in something - is better in a particular area, and disadvantaged in another. These areas include speed, health of ship, number of slots in inventory, initial weapons, ability or inability to use some of the found powerups. After selecting a ship the game / round (depending on the type) begins.</p>
<p><strong>Singleplayer</strong></p>
<p>Main focus will be Multiplayer but not everyone wants to or cannot play with others. So we will add a singleplayer option. Player will choose a similar map and mode like it is in MP and play againts AI bots.</p>
<p>There will be also tutorial how to play the game.</p>
<p>We have prepared a short story, how the Keepers are trained and few scenario maps. We dont promise this will be implemented to game but we would implement a short campaign if there will be demand for it.</p>
<h3>Ships and their properties</h3>
<p>Each ship has same features but differently strong. These abilities can be temporarily improved or, on the contrary, worsen, whether by you or enemy.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1553956787/qr4mqwuhxislw8aax5rc.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Health (HitPoints or HP)</strong> - is divided into 3 categories, subsystems. The exterior surface is shielded by an energy shield that, in the case of damage to most ships, is recovered per time unit. The middle layer of defence is armor / plating. The inner layer is the hull of the ship. Once this is destroyed, the ship is destroyed and the player died. Depending on the type of game, the player is respawned instantly or at the end of round.</p>
<p><strong>Speed ​​and Dexterity</strong> - The ship always flies forward at minimum speed (or stands still in specific scenario). Speed can be increased to maximum and is specific to each ship class. As well as dexterity and control of the ship - the speed of turning and tilt. We know that avionics is contrary to space physics. But no one wants Star Wars fighters with perpendicular maneuvers.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon </strong>- is primary attack of ship and each has its ammunition (type of). The capacity of the weapon in terms of ammunition is limited, ie it can only be filled to a certain amount. The weapons have a charging and discharging part, and each fired ""projectile"" has a defined interval from the other one (firerate). Ammunition can be specialized, such as EMP rounds more easily damage shields of the enemy ship, but then cause less damage to the hull and armor.</p>
<p><strong>Slots and inventory</strong> - is limited, mostly, by a ship size. Each slot represents the installed weapon or module. This entire grouping of slots is named inventory. You can switch between slots ie between modules so ship can carry multiple systems at  once.</p>
<p><strong>Items </strong>- will appear on the map in random configurations and positions, again controlled by pseudorandom. These are disposable items (one-use) or permanent modules. Disposable items serve as a temporary boost, such as replenishing shields or repairing a ship or increasing weapon damage (""healing potion"" type). The modules are installed in the slot until the player respawns or toss it. These modules can be passive or active. For example, the passive one can increase the speed of a ship or reduce damage. The active ones are used as weapons and often have a long cooldown. The weapons themselves are active modules.</p>
<h3>
<br/>Game Modes (Game Types)</h3>
<p><strong>Deathmatch </strong>- is a classic free-for-all. Fast and very dynamic. Playing in this mode may be limited in play time (round duration) or to the count of kills (frags) of other pilots.</p>
<p><strong>Team-Deathmatch</strong> - Like Deathmatch with 2 or more teams with the ability to turn on auto-balancing of teams. It may require a bit of tactical thinking, but it can be chaotic shootout anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Capture the flag</strong> - or game of stealing flags. The goal is to get an enemy flag (item) and deliver it to a particular place. Limited by time or number of successfully delivered flags.</p>
<p><strong>Guardian </strong>- One team attacks and the other defends a certain place. Once completed, the role is switched. Limited to reach goal (in-time or not). Necessary tactical thinking of the attackers.</p>
<p><strong>Role-play mission</strong> - PvE mode where 3 or more players join together (according to map and scenario). They then aim to perform certain tasks and reach the end of the map. Unlike other modes, players do not respawn automatically. You need to work together. Losing one player can mean the entire mission has failed.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h2>Background, inspiration and our team</h2>
<p>We are indie developers from the Czech Republic. Our team has only 2 people, a programmer and a graphic designer. We are professional freelancers and you guess right, a programmer and a grafic designer. We're a (dating) couple who LOVE to play video games and our dream is to release our first game.</p>
<p>We are just two ordinary people, with passion for videogames and dream to make our own.</p>
<p>I, Petr, the programmer, am responsible for game design and all programming, partialy for some design in technical terms (post-processing f.e.).</p>
<p>Petra (funny, right?), graphic designer, takes care of everything else. Visual effect, audio, modeling, textures, all presentation stuff like teaser video...</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1553956856/fevd1vl05qehdc7c9uph.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>As the great Star Wars fans and scifi in general, we have always been fascinated by a universe and space ships. Space fights have always been and will be a feast for the eye, whether in view of cockpit, bridge or tactical map (or hi-tech holographic projection). We love universe and near future documentaries as well as books, movies and games.</p>
<p>Lets divide the game and inspiration to 2 parts.</p>
<p>We were very inspired by EVE online, which has added a lot of functionality especially in recent years and has solved some burning questions about the purchased time. There are titles such as Homeworld, Sins of and Solar Empire, Mass Effect and others that only deepened our interest and inspiration with their detailed spacecrafts.</p>
<p>Last but not least, there is the second part of the inspiration that heavily influenced the style of the game. This part was born in the deep 90's, when it started out as an avalanche, spreading FPS multiplayer games and LAN gaming was more affordable than ever. We were always absorbed by x-hour gaming and friendly matches in Quake 2 (Edge map forever) or Half-life, which never ended with rage-quit or broken friendship. At that time, games were played for fun, killing time with friends, nobody proving anything to anyone with immature gestures ...</p>
<p>Games have been great entertaiment since the early years (pre-elementary) and we always wanted to create one of our own. Or just take one and make it our way. Back then a lots of games came out with map editors, a great tool to make your own scenarios. With a lot of time that a teenager has, it was then possible, for example, to make our own campaign in Starcraft. Well in truth... we took a bit of a non-standard approach (parody) when the main protagonist was named Jack Potato (Jack Brambor in Czech) and he helped to save Marleies civilization (named after Bob Marley). A lot of time was spent on dubbing and the whole process was strenuous and fun at the same time. Unfortunatelly I had a defective HDD and after few missions I have lost everything includes my old work...</p>
<p>This did not stop us. Doing games has become a dream and to some extent obsession ...</p>
<p>With maturity, and with a preview of the programming and gamedesign in general, the dream seems to began far more real. Even after the first attempts and mistakes with the creation of code and graphics (QBasic, Macromedia Flash - at elementary), together with the professional life experience (programming and graphic design of application), even more. Then it came to a stage where we were working on games more than working on job tasks ... Logically, there had to be a turn-point and since then it was no longer possible to work like that. And so it happened that we were unable to work on games anymore. The last AFK update is from November 2018.</p>
<p>Time to time we were talking about our homemade creations and colleges, clients, family and friend took interest. They reviewed the state of AFK and have pushing us forward to finish it since then. But we always replied, that we dont have time capacities...</p>
<p>Crowdfounding could solve this situation and that's why we are here and you are reading this long article.</p>
<h2>Where your money will go</h2>
<p>Most of the game mechanics are done but it lacks content. We primarily want to pay a ""modest living"" so we can mainly focus on development instead of contracts (freelance jobs).</p>
<p>Furthermore, it will be necessary to purchase licenses and some artistic creations such as better (paid) sounds and textures (graphics in general) which we are unable to reproduce.</p>
<p>With the required amount, we will be able to release the game as a ""full game"" or more likely as Early-Access (a game fund during development) in about 2-3 months of intense work. Of course we would like to continue working on it even after. Adding more and more content.</p>
<p>Ideal scenario: make the basic game, place it on steam with early-access, continue on it up to year (year and half if we implement all the stuff we have in our minds). Early access price will be 8-12 USD, something like that. Full-game? We are not sure, maybe a little bit more (up to 15 USD), but we think it will pretty much the same as early access. There are lots of variables.</p>
<h3>What now and what next scenario</h3>
<p>We have a lot of ideas in our minds, but from previous experiences we are already ""grounded"" and we soberly think of every move - instead of impulsive realization.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1553956657/ngc5i4f4mdqmkpzaevmf.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The game is estimated to be about 80% complete - in terms of skeletal elements. We need to complete this and add a new content in the form of new ships, items, maps and game modes ... We want to improve graphics and effects. Now we have only 1 ship and 1 map.</p>
<p>We are counting on the eternal balancing of the game - ship and weapons.</p>
<p>Basically, the first early-access game should contain 3 playable maps, 3 types of ships, 6 weapons and 5-10 items. Only one game mode will be Deathmatch. This will be a good the starting point. Further progress and roadmap will be published on instagram f.e.</p>
<p>Further plans are dependent on interest and resources. We want to implement other game modes (especially role-play is the most challenging and at the same time the most appealing), the other ingame-content - constantly expanding the game to final form.</p>
<p>As was mentioned before, target platform is PC. We love to extend it on Linux, Mac and Xbox. At the point we cannot promise that.</p>
<p>We also want to pay for the development of a website where we create a community and a background for communication of players with a team of developers (bug reports, etc.)</p>
<p>Over time, we want to implement a third-party server solution so players can play ""online"" completely. Search for or host your own. But this is a very difficult task. And it is ""echoes of future"".</p>
<p>Long term goal is to raise enough resources to make other games then. Pay artitst, other developers,... Create a studio maybe? Do it full time. That is why we need your help.</p>
<p><strong>Playable DEMO?</strong></p>
<p>Now the game is not in state we can give you to try it. There are few serious bugs which are still not taken care of.</p>
<p>But we like this idea and we will give you (free, you do not have to contribute) access to demo version later - approx. in middle of the May 2019.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; challenges</h3>
<p>At first, creating a game is complex process. It tooks lots of time, effort, talent, experience and knowledge. As any software development, to be honest. It is a continous learning process and sometimes there is better way how make it work properly in cost of additional needed time.</p>
<p>These and others (like optimistic release time) can make release date(s) shifted. Nobody likes that inclueded us. But well, it happens.</p>
<p>Our team is created by 2 people, which do everything from firing a bullet, collision with asteroid, textures, models, to creating scene effects and level design... We are not AAA company with name on market and HUGE budget...</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1553956694/d2qaiwct2uaoxlae5mns.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Problem in these days are projects which have overhyped campaign and the results are poor (instead of pure). One thing is clear. The communication, lies, false promises and technical issues are the core of problem which cause players to leave or distrust any game development in future. We fully understand that. As we also bought early access games with great potential, which are almost unplayable but this time - ""Early-access disaster"".</p>
<p>Lets take a look to our plans how to conquer these.</p>
<p>At first, let us make one thing clear. When we say we do not lie to you - it is shorter version of: ""We are not stupid/brave enough to take responsibility for every lie we could say/write/publish. Every lie has an eventual aftermath which can destroy our dream very quickly. We understand that someone can be offended with truth/reality but we choose to stay honest and give you the option to deal with given information your way.""</p>
<p><strong>Communication</strong></p>
<p>We dont lie to you. Finishing game in-time is a challenge as described before. But when problem is discovered, we will let you know. Problem makes you mad anyway, why not try to calm you down instead of playing a dead bug. This is why we dont give you DEMO right now.</p>
<p>Hopefully we raise enough to create website and build community services to communicate with you effectively.</p>
<p><strong>Lies</strong></p>
<p>We dont lie to you. Everything written here is truth and it is about you, if you trust us and want to help us. As we mentioned before, we do not want to take any risk from any lie to danger game development. Releasing the game is our dream. We want to play it too!</p>
<p>Making game is expensive and required amount (we assure you) is not enought to live on Bahamas with a released Vaporware... It barely pays the time we already spent on it. But for us, it is a starting point to finish it to (publicly) playable form and give it needed care. And content of course.</p>
<p><strong>False promises</strong></p>
<p>We dont lie to you. We are not experts with tenths of thousands of years of experience in making games or its content. It is officially our first game after all. But we are experienced enough from professional life to make it done and please you with result. At the end the results count only and you will be the judge. Google ""variablearts"" and you will see our work.</p>
<p>We dont want any microtransaction nor DLCs nor monthly subscription!</p>
<p><strong>Technical issues</strong></p>
<p>We dont lie to you. We are currently using public game engine which seems to ""do the job"". But in recent time there were compatibility issues in newly released versions. This concernes us deeply at the same level as we already know the GAME (previously mentioned as early-access disaster) which is using the same engine is totally not optimized and has multiplayer issues. FPS drop rates, bugs (i mean serious which closes the game completely), lags and issues in client server sync... All these and others make us disbelieve it is not only issue of a irresponsibility of company creating the game but the engine itself.</p>
<p>This may cause the portation to another publicly available engine or even writing our own (in extreme case). We dont want to release low quality game.</p>
<h3>That is it</h3>
<p>If you read all of these, you have our respect. We believe we wrote everything that you need to know if you want to help us with your contribute.</p>
<p>You can do even more. and help us in other way. Share this in social media, give a word to a friends or colleges, folks interested in projects like this. This will do great.</p>
<p><strong>Every contributor will have a opportunity to change the game. </strong>Follow us on instagram: <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/astrofight/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.instagram.com/astrofight/</a></p>
<p>We will weekly let you know about our progress. We will show you new content and things we are working on as well as decisions. Time to time we will public behind scene information. When the game will be released as first early-access, contributors could enter special area where will be private information only for them. We appreciate every contributor and as gesture of proving it we will let you, contributors, vote for game content! For example we will give you a list of possibilities and you choose which will be implemented first, which later, and which absolutely not.</p>
<p>Dont forget to use indiegogo tools.</p>
<p>We have perks which we hope you will find attractive. Do you have idea for a perk or we missing something? Let us know.</p>

</div><p> </p></div>","Story and universe
Many years have passed since humanity first left the surface of its mother planet Earth and decided to explore the sky. And did not stop there. Driven by the overpopulation of the planet and the desire for knowledge, for centuries of failure it has became possible to uncover the secrets of space travel.
New worlds, new resources have been discovered. And it is in human nature to fight for these. Whole empires were created and subsequently disappeared, pushed out by neighbors, or destroyed from within. In addition, rumors of an aggressive, extraterrestrial race that invaded the peripheral worlds have appeared. When these rumors turned into a real manace and threat to the human race as whole, most of the quarrelled factions began to talk about an alliance, although temporary.
This is how the Confederacy arose, which is present to this day. Quantas of newly emerging confederation currency began to flow into common funds. In addition to building a common infrastructure, a vast logistics and defensive positions around the core of the sector, a considerable amount of money was spent to finance the new Keepers project.

The Keepers program trains the most talented pilots in the sector and transforms them into elite unit members. These pilots do not specialize in only one type of spacecraft, because of their training and talent, they control all available classes. They are experts in both weapons and defense systems, engineering and they are strategy expets who master the maneuvering of the ship. The graduates of this program is referred to as the Keepers and are widely deployed on battlefields as a strategic advisor and moral boost. In similar rate in secret and sabotage operations (black ops).
Not much is known about the program. The information is intentionally concealed to the public and deliberately misrepresented. Rumors say that immoral practices such as cybernetic and genetic experiments on cadets are also covered. Apparently to get the best out of the subjects. Which allegedly leads to frequent departures and, more often, cadets' deaths. The program only completes the strongest. However, it seems to fulfill its purpose ...
 
The game
As outlined above, this is a multiplayer space game where the player is a pilot. He flies a spaceship and tries to shoot down other players or fight the environment (PvE and PvP).
AFK´s destination platform is PC, for now.

The main element of the game is dynamics. Everything starts with selecting a game type (* Chapters: ""What to expect in the future"", ""Game modes"") and then selecting a map. Each map is more or less generated by a pseudo-random. E.g. asteroid clusters of different sizes and speeds are created as well as their predefined count. This ensures a more dynamics to the game, as there are no specialized places where players can use the environment (such as camping) to their unfair advantage. This also makes every map unique.
Players join the host and select the type/class of spaceship. Each is specific in something - is better in a particular area, and disadvantaged in another. These areas include speed, health of ship, number of slots in inventory, initial weapons, ability or inability to use some of the found powerups. After selecting a ship the game / round (depending on the type) begins.
Singleplayer
Main focus will be Multiplayer but not everyone wants to or cannot play with others. So we will add a singleplayer option. Player will choose a similar map and mode like it is in MP and play againts AI bots.
There will be also tutorial how to play the game.
We have prepared a short story, how the Keepers are trained and few scenario maps. We dont promise this will be implemented to game but we would implement a short campaign if there will be demand for it.
Ships and their properties
Each ship has same features but differently strong. These abilities can be temporarily improved or, on the contrary, worsen, whether by you or enemy.

Health (HitPoints or HP) - is divided into 3 categories, subsystems. The exterior surface is shielded by an energy shield that, in the case of damage to most ships, is recovered per time unit. The middle layer of defence is armor / plating. The inner layer is the hull of the ship. Once this is destroyed, the ship is destroyed and the player died. Depending on the type of game, the player is respawned instantly or at the end of round.
Speed ​​and Dexterity - The ship always flies forward at minimum speed (or stands still in specific scenario). Speed can be increased to maximum and is specific to each ship class. As well as dexterity and control of the ship - the speed of turning and tilt. We know that avionics is contrary to space physics. But no one wants Star Wars fighters with perpendicular maneuvers.
Weapon - is primary attack of ship and each has its ammunition (type of). The capacity of the weapon in terms of ammunition is limited, ie it can only be filled to a certain amount. The weapons have a charging and discharging part, and each fired ""projectile"" has a defined interval from the other one (firerate). Ammunition can be specialized, such as EMP rounds more easily damage shields of the enemy ship, but then cause less damage to the hull and armor.
Slots and inventory - is limited, mostly, by a ship size. Each slot represents the installed weapon or module. This entire grouping of slots is named inventory. You can switch between slots ie between modules so ship can carry multiple systems at  once.

Disposable items serve as a temporary boost, such as replenishing shields or repairing a ship or increasing weapon damage (""healing potion"" type).

Background, inspiration and our team
We are indie developers from the Czech Republic. Our team has only 2 people, a programmer and a graphic designer. We are professional freelancers and you guess right, a programmer and a grafic designer. We're a (dating) couple who LOVE to play video games and our dream is to release our first game.
We are just two ordinary people, with passion for videogames and dream to make our own.
I, Petr, the programmer, am responsible for game design and all programming, partialy for some design in technical terms (post-processing f.e.).
Petra (funny, right?), graphic designer, takes care of everything else. Visual effect, audio, modeling, textures, all presentation stuff like teaser video...

As the great Star Wars fans and scifi in general, we have always been fascinated by a universe and space ships. Space fights have always been and will be a feast for the eye, whether in view of cockpit, bridge or tactical map (or hi-tech holographic projection). We love universe and near future documentaries as well as books, movies and games.
Lets divide the game and inspiration to 2 parts.
We were very inspired by EVE online, which has added a lot of functionality especially in recent years and has solved some burning questions about the purchased time. There are titles such as Homeworld, Sins of and Solar Empire, Mass Effect and others that only deepened our interest and inspiration with their detailed spacecrafts.
Last but not least, there is the second part of the inspiration that heavily influenced the style of the game. This part was born in the deep 90's, when it started out as an avalanche, spreading FPS multiplayer games and LAN gaming was more affordable than ever. We were always absorbed by x-hour gaming and friendly matches in Quake 2 (Edge map forever) or Half-life, which never ended with rage-quit or broken friendship. At that time, games were played for fun, killing time with friends, nobody proving anything to anyone with immature gestures ...

Back then a lots of games came out with map editors, a great tool to make your own scenarios. With a lot of time that a teenager has, it was then possible, for example, to make our own campaign in Starcraft. Well in truth... we took a bit of a non-standard approach (parody) when the main protagonist was named Jack Potato (Jack Brambor in Czech) and he helped to save Marleies civilization (named after Bob Marley). A lot of time was spent on dubbing and the whole process was strenuous and fun at the same time. Unfortunatelly I had a defective HDD and after few missions I have lost everything includes my old work...

Crowdfounding could solve this situation and that's why we are here and you are reading this long article.
Where your money will go
Most of the game mechanics are done but it lacks content. We primarily want to pay a ""modest living"" so we can mainly focus on development instead of contracts (freelance jobs).
Furthermore, it will be necessary to purchase licenses and some artistic creations such as better (paid) sounds and textures (graphics in general) which we are unable to reproduce.
With the required amount, we will be able to release the game as a ""full game"" or more likely as Early-Access (a game fund during development) in about 2-3 months of intense work. Of course we would like to continue working on it even after. Adding more and more content.
Ideal scenario: make the basic game, place it on steam with early-access, continue on it up to year (year and half if we implement all the stuff we have in our minds). Early access price will be 8-12 USD, something like that. Full-game? We are not sure, maybe a little bit more (up to 15 USD), but we think it will pretty much the same as early access. There are lots of variables.
What now and what next scenario
We have a lot of ideas in our minds, but from previous experiences we are already ""grounded"" and we soberly think of every move - instead of impulsive realization.

The game is estimated to be about 80% complete - in terms of skeletal elements. We need to complete this and add a new content in the form of new ships, items, maps and game modes ... We want to improve graphics and effects. Now we have only 1 ship and 1 map.

Basically, the first early-access game should contain 3 playable maps, 3 types of ships, 6 weapons and 5-10 items. Only one game mode will be Deathmatch. This will be a good the starting point. Further progress and roadmap will be published on instagram f.e.

We also want to pay for the development of a website where we create a community and a background for communication of players with a team of developers (bug reports, etc.)
Over time, we want to implement a third-party server solution so players can play ""online"" completely. Search for or host your own. But this is a very difficult task. And it is ""echoes of future"".

Every lie has an eventual aftermath which can destroy our dream very quickly. We understand that someone can be offended with truth/reality but we choose to stay honest and give you the option to deal with given information your way.""
Communication
We dont lie to you. Finishing game in-time is a challenge as described before. But when problem is discovered, we will let you know. Problem makes you mad anyway, why not try to calm you down instead of playing a dead bug. This is why we dont give you DEMO right now.
Hopefully we raise enough to create website and build community services to communicate with you effectively.
Lies
We dont lie to you. Everything written here is truth and it is about you, if you trust us and want to help us. As we mentioned before, we do not want to take any risk from any lie to danger game development. Releasing the game is our dream. We want to play it too!
Making game is expensive and required amount (we assure you) is not enought to live on Bahamas with a released Vaporware... It barely pays the time we already spent on it. But for us, it is a starting point to finish it to (publicly) playable form and give it needed care. And content of course.
False promises
We dont lie to you. We are not experts with tenths of thousands of years of experience in making games or its content. It is officially our first game after all. But we are experienced enough from professional life to make it done and please you with result. At the end the results count only and you will be the judge. Google ""variablearts"" and you will see our work.
We dont want any microtransaction nor DLCs nor monthly subscription!
Technical issues
We dont lie to you. We are currently using public game engine which seems to ""do the job"". But in recent time there were compatibility issues in newly released versions. This concernes us deeply at the same level as we already know the GAME (previously mentioned as early-access disaster) which is using the same engine is totally not optimized and has multiplayer issues. FPS drop rates, bugs (i mean serious which closes the game completely), lags and issues in client server sync... All these and others make us disbelieve it is not only issue of a irresponsibility of company creating the game but the engine itself.
This may cause the portation to another publicly available engine or even writing our own (in extreme case). We dont want to release low quality game.
That is it
If you read all of these, you have our respect. We believe we wrote everything that you need to know if you want to help us with your contribute.
You can do even more. and help us in other way. Share this in social media, give a word to a friends or colleges, folks interested in projects like this. This will do great.
Every contributor will have a opportunity to change the game. Follow us on instagram: https://www.instagram.com/astrofight/
We will weekly let you know about our progress. We will show you new content and things we are working on as well as decisions. Time to time we will public behind scene information. When the game will be released as first early-access, contributors could enter special area where will be private information only for them. We appreciate every contributor and as gesture of proving it we will let you, contributors, vote for game content! For example we will give you a list of possibilities and you choose which will be implemented first, which later, and which absolutely not.
Dont forget to use indiegogo tools.
We have perks which we hope you will find attractive. Do you have idea for a perk or we missing something? Let us know.

We will dress you and give you a fuel tank f.e.

We thank you very much for reading this article and your support! I hope my english skills are good enough.",9.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>First of all, <strong>thank you</strong> for taking the time to view my project!</p>
<p>I am a lone Indie developer currently working on a revolutionary horror game called '<strong>Resonance</strong>' in which you use <strong>echolocation</strong> (sonar) to navigate through a <strong>terrifying narrative experience</strong>. </p>
<p>In <strong>Resonance</strong> you awake in an unknown environment. Don't let the Cliche beginning fool you - the original and complex narrative of the game unfolds naturally as you play. Although you begin the game clueless to your environment, a player with a keen eye will soon put together the pieces of the puzzle and find themselves answering the questions posed from the very beginning. Solving the mystery of the backstory and environment is the key to success in this<strong> multi-ended</strong> game.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525290653/vurwflfoyjjo7zeogeo8.png"" src=""""/></p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Echolocation - </strong>In Resonance you are able to see by making noise. This can be through movement, clapping, interacting with the environment and other methods. However, when you make noise you risk being discovered by things you would rather avoid. This adds an interesting element of strategy to navigating the environment which is enhanced by thoughtful and <strong>innovative level design </strong>and <strong>multiple enemy types</strong> each with different ways to detect you. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://i.imgur.com/zhKPcNY.gif"" src=""""/>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Every death is a serious loss</strong>. Like old-school games if you die too often and lose all “lives” then it is game over. This is a very important feature for a horror game which is often overlooked. The primary flaw of otherwise excellent games like <strong>Resident Evil 7</strong> and <strong>Outlast</strong> is that after a few deaths you will begin to feel immune to the element of fear. Each death reminds you that there is no real danger or reason for suspense as there is nothing at stake. This is not the case in <strong>Resonance</strong> - die too many times and you will lose your progress. (This feature can be disabled if it is not to your liking).</li>
<li>The game is near <strong>content-completion</strong> and will be released on <strong>S</strong><strong>team Early Access</strong> to further <strong>expand the game</strong> through extending the narrative and adding new mechanics. Models, textures and animations are already at a production-level of quality.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://i.imgur.com/OqSyhbY.gif"" src=""""/>
</li>
<li>The personal ideas of all backers and Early Access purchasers will directly affect the final game - I want to listen to my audience and turn this 1-person Dev team into thousands of <strong>vocal community</strong> members giving their input to make this game a perfect experience.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Who am I?</strong></h3>
<p>My name is Andrew Nicolaou, I consider myself a Jack of all trades - currently adept in all elements of game design such as programming, 3D-modelling, animating, story-telling and level-design. Having a computer science background and a long-lasting passion for videogames and creative works is what drove me to begin this project. Early this year, having already mastered the <strong>Unity3D</strong> engine and <strong>Blender </strong>3D-modelling software through developing small personal projects, I decided I was ready to embark on this commercial endeavor and began full-time development of my first published game. Now, five months down the line, I could use some help from you to finish it. </p>

<p><strong>Sound Effects:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sound is integral to the very premise of this game so sound effects must be developed in-house and be extremely high quality.</li>
<li>I am currently working with a professional sound effects artist and sound engineer to make this possible.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Exposure:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Making a great game is no longer enough for it to be noticed by its audience.</li>
<li>Unfortunately the Indie scene is extremely over-saturated in today's market with low quality games flooding Steam and other platforms making it nearly impossible for a good indie game to be noticed.</li>
<li>Trying to self publish a game is often impossible without significant funds.</li>
<li>Yet choosing to partner with a publisher means perverting the artistic image of the game in order to drive profits through corporate greed.</li>
<li>I don't want to be forced to put micro-transactions in this single player game!</li>
<li>To gain any exposure a modest marketing budget must be considered to be used for intelligent marketing using medium-profile Youtubers and Websites.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Continued Development:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I’ve already sunk a large amount of my personal money into the project and am now finding it difficult to cover living expenses while also investing in the game. In order to stay independent and avoid the external influences of publishers I am opting to independently develop this game. </li>

                                            Help me (and my cat) bring this game to market!

What We Need & What You Get
This is where YOU come in. By helping raise the funds necessary you will be ensuring the future of this game. You can help far more than you think by pledging even a small amount.
Sound Effects:

Sound is integral to the very premise of this game so sound effects must be developed in-house and be extremely high quality.
I am currently working with a professional sound effects artist and sound engineer to make this possible.
Currently the sound track contains 4 songs which will be expanded greatly.

Exposure:

Making a great game is no longer enough for it to be noticed by its audience.
Unfortunately the Indie scene is extremely over-saturated in today's market with low quality games flooding Steam and other platforms making it nearly impossible for a good indie game to be noticed.
Trying to self publish a game is often impossible without significant funds.
Yet choosing to partner with a publisher means perverting the artistic image of the game in order to drive profits through corporate greed.
I don't want to be forced to put micro-transactions in this single player game!
To gain any exposure a modest marketing budget must be considered to be used for intelligent marketing using medium-profile Youtubers and Websites.

Continued Development:

I’ve already sunk a large amount of my personal money into the project and am now finding it difficult to cover living expenses while also investing in the game. In order to stay independent and avoid the external influences of publishers I am opting to independently develop this game. 
Put simply, I gotta eat!

How the money will be spent
If fully funded the breakdown will be a little like this:


£2000 - Professional sound track and sfx development.

£2000 - Intelligent marketing using medium-profile Youtubers and Websites.

£1000 - Continued development up until Early Access Release.


Unique Perks

Pledge anything and your name will be included in the ThankYou.txt file packaged with the game.
Pledge £5 to receive the Early Adopters price for a copy of the game as well as the opportunity to have your input affect the development of the game.
Pledge £10 to receive the game as well as the final sound track and digital concept artwork (some of these are literal ball-point pen scribbles).
Pledge £100  to be credited as a vital investor in the game.
Pledge £500 to have an NPC named after you (the name may be altered slightly to fit the lore of the game).
Pledge £1000 to design a short sequence in the game (e.g a puzzle and enemy sequence).

Stretch Goals


£6000 – Steam trading card system

<p><u>WHO WE ARE</u></p>
<p>Hi, my name is Paul Andress and I live in the Milwaukee area with my family where I am a lifelong Catholic and a member of Men of Christ, a Catholic Men’s group. My family and I love to spend winter nights playing board games. But we noticed that some games, although fun to play, lacked the moral character that we desired.  So it was only natural that we developed our own game company, <i>DEEPWATER GAMES LLC</i>. The name originated from the quote by St. John Paul the Great, “Do not be afraid. Do not be satisfied with mediocrity. Put out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch.""</p>
<p>The <i>mission of DEEPWATER GAMES </i> is to bring games to market that are fun and entertaining, but also have a Catholic identity from which the players can learn more about their awesome Catholic faith. We will be developing games that deal with Catholic Tradition, culture, history, and so much more. The <i>goal of this campaign</i> is to fund the production of <i>GODSPEED - A CATHOLIC JOURNEY THROUGH LIFE!</i> , our first game, and to provide the funds needed for additional game development.</p>
</div><div>
<p>Our goal is to raise a minimum of $82,000. Board game production in low volume is very costly. Therefore we have set a goal of a minimum of  2000 pre-ordered games. This volume gets us to a price point where we can keep the game affordable. The cost of these games plus shipping and handling runs close to $50,000. The remaining money will go toward more games, taxes, fees assessed by Indiegogo and PayPal, and to pay for the art and graphics needed for the next game.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><u>PERKS</u></p>
<p>We hope you like the perks we chose:</p>
<ul>
<li>Friend - First of all, our faith means everything to us and we felt that we wanted to pray for all of you that donate to the campaign. Outside of the Mass the Holy Rosary is our favorite prayer. We pray nightly and would like to include you in our prayer intentions.</li>
<li>Supporter -  one of our favorite places of worship is The National Shrine of Mary, Help of Christians at Holy Hill in Hubertus, Wisconsin. We will add a Mass intention on your behalf at the Shrine as a thank you for your donation.</li>
<li>Backer - This perk is a pre-order of the game <i>GODSPEED - A CATHOLIC JOURNEY THROUGH LIFE!</i>  Please consider them as gifts for your children and grandchildren for First Communion, birthday and Christmas.</li>
<li>Promoter - This perk gets you two games and a bonus CD called <u>Jesu and Maria</u>, professionally recorded by <u>The Andress Sisters</u>. You can hear a sample of the CD  here <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/jesu-and-maria/id1032060149"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/jesu-and-mari...</a>
</li>
<li>Distributor - This perk is for anyone who would like to sell more games through their business. We have given a special distributor pricing as an incentive.</li>
<li>Advisor - this perk is a very special one in which you can participate in the development and testing of future games. If you are energized over getting good games into good homes, this might be the opportunity you have been looking for. We'd love to have new ideas and suggestions as we go through this process. Some restrictions may apply.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are setting this up as a fixed campaign largely due to the need to achieve the 2000  game goal to keep the manufacturing costs down. If we don't approach it this way, we could end up paying more for production than the campaign can support. If the goal isn't achieved, then all the donations will be refunded back to you. This is all managed by Indiegogo and PayPal.</p>
</div><div>
<p><u>OUR TEAM</u></p>
<p>My family played a big part in developing <i>GODSPEED – A CATHOLIC JOURNEY THROUGH LIFE. </i>They were the artists, designers, critics, editors, and testers. We are very grateful to our friends who, in the next stage of development, tried it out!  This campaign brings together the things we love most- our Faith, family, friends, and games!</p>
<p>Just a note, the components in the videos are prototype level. The final product will have improvements incorporated.</p>
<p>While I've never brought a game to market, I do have practical experience in manufacturing as a leader of a manufacturing organization. I've been a part of design/manufacture/shipping functions my whole career, and feel I can manage those parts of this project safely.</p>
</div><div>
<p><u>RISKS</u></p>
<p>Like with any project there are some risks and challenges. We risk not achieving the goal and therefore not getting the product to market, which means it wouldn't be available to families that might like it. There is also risk that we might have to extend the campaign to reach the goal; we would only do this if we are close to achieving the goal.  If the goal were extended, we would not be able to ship the games prior to Christmas. You can greatly help avoid this problem by getting the word out and passing the campaign on to others you know.</p>
</div><div>
<p><u>HOW YOU CAN HELP</u></p>
<p>If you are not in a position to donate, we understand. However,  you could be a tremendous help to us by <strong>praying for success of the campaign</strong>. In addition, by <strong>passing on the information to others who may be able to donate or would like to pre-order a game</strong> you would be doing us a great favor. Indiegogo has many tools to help you get the word out.</p>

<p>
Lovecraft Tales is an adventure game based on short story written by the famous horror writer - <strong>Howard Phillips Lovecraft</strong> (you can read about him, in case you have no idea who the heck was this guy). The story in question is <strong>""The Whisperer in Darkness""</strong>. While most games that are based on Lovecraft works are about Cthulhu (giant squid-like monster, quite overused I'd say), we want to give you something different. 
</p>

<p>
We've been doing it for quite long time, and we reached a pretty advanced stage of development. We laid foundation for the game, created framework for puzzle, day &amp; night system, inventory, diary, possibility to walk throught the game world, systems like fear/insanity/hunger (although they are not implemented yet because there is not enough game content for them to make sense). We also created tons of art so you can experience beautiful and immersive environments.<br/>
</p>
<p>
It's not just an idea supported by no experience, like you often see, it's a real thing. It's the result of 3,5 years of work (approximately).
</p>
<p>
You don't have to believe only in words, you can download a playable prototype in case you missed the big graphic link above :).

</p>
<br/>
<p>
H.P Lovecraft created genre called lovecraftian horror. It's bit different from classical horror, it's more depressive and misanthropic. </p>
<p>One of it's topics is insignificance of mankind in the universe. In H.P. Lovecraft writings, history of mankind is rather meaningless and short, the world he created is filled with many different, alien beings and deities, that are far more powerful and intelligent than us... And not necessarily friendly. It's definitely not an anthropocentric world.</p>
<p>It's also about hopelessness and fragility of human psyche, because when Lovecraftian protagonist is finally discovering the truth about nature of universe, he loses his mind or breaks down, he just can't digest it.</p>
<p>Also, it's about fear of the unknown. It leaves opened questions - and maybe that's why it's so appealing, because it leaves lot of space for imagination.</p>
<br/>

</p>
<p>
Of course, we have mindset for bigger plan, but for now we want to focus on what's in front of our noses. Then, we can proceed further (and that's what stretch goals are made for). This basic release plan is crucial. <br/>Therefore, for finishing the 1st episode in this minimum plan, we need:</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Finished story and gameplay</h4>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1471116795/fishing-shack-1_t38bct.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>In our playable prototype you can have a taste of how game will look and feel, but there's not much in terms of actual gameplay. We have a game framework, and the next step is to fill it with actual content, create immersive story with beginning, end and some interesting turning points inside.<br/>We have already designed the story - that will develop threads started in game prototype. It will be built upon that, but for now we're not telling more.<br/>Of course, it will require much work to implement and it requires creating some new artworks and code (but the main focus is on the art because it will be the biggest part of work).</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Redesigned and simplified interiors</h4>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1471116827/walter-shack-1_pmmsqe.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>We decided to do it based on feedback that we got from players so far. You all have foundd the interiors being too confusing for such simple buildings, so we will get rid of changing camera angles inside the buildings, and we will make all rooms connected rather than isolated like it's now. You will see building's structure while you're inside.
</p>
<p>Maybe we will leave confusing camera turning for some special occasions, because maybe some areas will be maze-like, but it will be part of the stretch goals, when we achieve them</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Death</h4>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1471116863/entresol-1_kpttlx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>Quite an important feature for a horror game, don't you agree?</p>
<p>In our prototype it's impossible to die, but this will change. We want to add much more tension. We're not sure yet if it will be permanent death or not. Ideally, we want to implement difficulty levels, but again, see stretch goals. For sure you will be able to die in some really nasty and dirty ways.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Cutscenes</h4>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1471116894/stone-circle-1_qt969e.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p>They will fill gap between story and game itself, they are important thinga to introcude the hero, the story and the backgrounds, they provide some endings and hopefully some interludes. We won't go like Hollywood style, please don't expect that, it's not that kind of game and we don't have budget for that. They will have form of static screens with voiceover or partially animated movie frames that get frozen in time, depending on the total amount we will collect.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>UI redesign</h4>
<p>Currently the UI is outdated, it's a prototype that hasn't been touched much really, we only refined art to look decent enough. It was designed having a mobile game in mind, but things changed, so it doesn't make much sense anymore. It's a part of the game that I really want to change, badly.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1471116923/stone-circle-2_bud7im.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p>Basically, we want to get rid of most UI elements or hide them whenever it's possible to make the game as immersive as possible. So no more old fashioned icons cluttering screen.</p>
<h4>Dialogues</h4>
<p>Currently there are no NPC-s in game, so you are quite alone. Of course, we wan to change that and add some life and interaction. Don't expect us to add a lot of them, though. In few key-locations you will be able to talk with some characters, and depending on how you run the conversation, you will learn different things. Also, don't expect NPC-s to act like idiots and answer same question over and over again... they will rather treat You like an idiot :). So, you will have to be mindful. </p>

<p>Gianni Chiarparini is an experienced music producer and composer who has collaborated successfully with popular artists, has scored for movies, commercials, documentaries and indie games. Gianni has just finished to compose the music for ""Starcrafts Mod"". He is the founder of Violet Music production where he teamed up with the very talented producer Simone Ermacora. Considering Gianni's big passion for Lovecraft (since his teenage years) and survival horror games, the match was obvious, Violet music production is composing REALLY dark ambient soundtrack for Lovecraft Tales, together with sound design. Music will play an important role in the game, so here you can have a taste of how it's going to be:</p>

<h4>Sewer Hrehorowicz</h4>
<p>I'm the creator of this game, and I've been working on it for about 3 years. Primarily I'm an artist, but I had to learn lot of different skills in order to finish what I began - like level design, sound design, game design, scripting, writing, project management to name few... But I like learning.</p>
<h4>Edouard Bouchez</h4>
<p>C# programmer that took challenge and has been working with me for almost 2 years, with no money... He is the most reliable person that I've ever worked with. He puts his time, energy, money and heart to this game and he is doing it at 100% like I do. For that, I will be eternally thankful.</p>

<h3></h3>
<p>Of course, we would not do it all alone. There were, and there are people that helped us in various ways, in most cases in exchange of profit in a distant future. It takes guts and heart to do this, so we want to honour them:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Gianni Chiarparini</strong> - he decided to compose all music and produce all sounds for game</li>
<li>
<strong>Marek Nowak</strong> - he helped with the story a lot... really lot</li>
<li>
<strong>Alicja Stempa</strong> - she helped with coding. You can admire day &amp; night system and animated trees thanks to her</li>
<li>
<strong>Evgeny Chucha</strong> - he animated the protagonist</li>
<li>
<strong>Ted Garnie</strong> - he created some environmental artworks</li>
<li>
<strong>Hubert Świątek</strong> - he composed the music for our previous trailer and made great jingle</li>
<li>
<strong>Tobias Ezra Queen, Mark Talman, Paweł Mielewczyk</strong> - they provided great voiceovers</li>
<strong>Dagmara Klimczak</strong> - she provided English translation for game
<li>
<strong>Robert Chrzanowski</strong> - he also animated the protagonist but we haven't had the chance to use it yet</li>
<li>
<strong>Dominik Hrehorowicz</strong> - he placed all sounds in the levels and traced many bugs</li>
</ul>
<p>And there are some people that decided to stay anonymous, although their contribution is visible and important. You may not be even aware of it...</p>

<br/>
<p>We dedicated lot of time, energy and money for the development of Lovecraft Tales. I personally dedicated most of my time for 1,5 year, it hurt me financially. I haven't seen it coming, but it was inevitable. We released demo, but we can't go further without your support, and I personally can't do it for sure.
</p>
<p>You can also understand that making games takes lot of money, and this time we set our goals really low because we already did a huge part of it.</p>
<p>We also didn't want to make deal with publisher so far, because we want to stay independent and follow our vision.</p>
<p>Besides that, for me personally it's a huge part of my life, that took an unimaginable amount of work and time... You don't expect that I will just give up onit away, do you?</p>

<br/>
<p>
<strong>Q: When the game will be finished?</strong>
<br/><strong>A:</strong> It depends on stretch goals that we achieve. The more of them, the longer it'll take. I estimate 6 months for basic plan, and 1,5 year with all additional stretch goals.
<br/>
<strong>Q: When I will get rewards?</strong>
<br/><strong>A:</strong> Generally, after releasing the game. Some rewards may come earlier, though, like for example hangouts and membership site access.
<br/>
<strong>Q: Why don't you promise more for that amount of money&gt; You seem to be over-cautious</strong>
<br/><strong>A:</strong> Yeah, I know that some people do that. You know, I'm trying to be realistic. We have some experience, we did a lot without any support, and we know how much it costs to add one simple feature. You honestly have no frickin idea.
<br/>
<strong>Q: I don't like this and that, it could be done better. Why are you so sloppy?</strong>
<br/><strong>A:</strong> Because I prefer sloppy success over perfect mediocrity. I like to get things done. You have no idea how many compromises we need to make in order to have things done.
<br/>
<strong>Q: Where is your budget breakdown?</strong>
<br/><strong>A:</strong> I won't post it because it's not fixed. We need to pay taxes, fees, rewards costs, but that's obvious. I need to have salary during development, but there are many many unpredicatble factors and we don't know yet what we will buy and what we will do. It depends on stretch goals. The more money we collect, the more people we will need to pay in general.
<br/>
<strong>Q: Are there more questions to be answered?</strong>
<br/><strong>A:</strong> Maybe, I don't know. It depends on you. Write to me if you have one, and I'll post it there.

<br/>
<p>If you like it - contribute. Now :). Tomorrow is never, you know how it works.</p></div>","Lovecraft Tales is an adventure game based on short story written by the famous horror writer - Howard Phillips Lovecraft (you can read about him, in case you have no idea who the heck was this guy). The story in question is ""The Whisperer in Darkness"". While most games that are based on Lovecraft works are about Cthulhu (giant squid-like monster, quite overused I'd say), we want to give you something different. 










We've been doing it for quite long time, and we reached a pretty advanced stage of development. We laid foundation for the game, created framework for puzzle, day & night system, inventory, diary, possibility to walk throught the game world, systems like fear/insanity/hunger (although they are not implemented yet because there is not enough game content for them to make sense). We also created tons of art so you can experience beautiful and immersive environments.


It's not just an idea supported by no experience, like you often see, it's a real thing. It's the result of 3,5 years of work (approximately).


You don't have to believe only in words, you can download a playable prototype in case you missed the big graphic link above :).










H.P Lovecraft created genre called lovecraftian horror. It's bit different from classical horror, it's more depressive and misanthropic. 
One of it's topics is insignificance of mankind in the universe. In H.P. Lovecraft writings, history of mankind is rather meaningless and short, the world he created is filled with many different, alien beings and deities, that are far more powerful and intelligent than us... And not necessarily friendly. It's definitely not an anthropocentric world.
It's also about hopelessness and fragility of human psyche, because when Lovecraftian protagonist is finally discovering the truth about nature of universe, he loses his mind or breaks down, he just can't digest it.
Also, it's about fear of the unknown. It leaves opened questions - and maybe that's why it's so appealing, because it leaves lot of space for imagination.








Of course, we have mindset for bigger plan, but for now we want to focus on what's in front of our noses. Then, we can proceed further (and that's what stretch goals are made for). This basic release plan is crucial. Therefore, for finishing the 1st episode in this minimum plan, we need:

Finished story and gameplay

In our playable prototype you can have a taste of how game will look and feel, but there's not much in terms of actual gameplay. We have a game framework, and the next step is to fill it with actual content, create immersive story with beginning, end and some interesting turning points inside.We have already designed the story - that will develop threads started in game prototype. It will be built upon that, but for now we're not telling more.Of course, it will require much work to implement and it requires creating some new artworks and code (but the main focus is on the art because it will be the biggest part of work).

Redesigned and simplified interiors

We decided to do it based on feedback that we got from players so far. You all have foundd the interiors being too confusing for such simple buildings, so we will get rid of changing camera angles inside the buildings, and we will make all rooms connected rather than isolated like it's now. You will see building's structure while you're inside.

Maybe we will leave confusing camera turning for some special occasions, because maybe some areas will be maze-like, but it will be part of the stretch goals, when we achieve them

Death

Quite an important feature for a horror game, don't you agree?
In our prototype it's impossible to die, but this will change. We want to add much more tension. We're not sure yet if it will be permanent death or not. Ideally, we want to implement difficulty levels, but again, see stretch goals. For sure you will be able to die in some really nasty and dirty ways.

Cutscenes


They will fill gap between story and game itself, they are important thinga to introcude the hero, the story and the backgrounds, they provide some endings and hopefully some interludes. We won't go like Hollywood style, please don't expect that, it's not that kind of game and we don't have budget for that. They will have form of static screens with voiceover or partially animated movie frames that get frozen in time, depending on the total amount we will collect.

UI redesign
Currently the UI is outdated, it's a prototype that hasn't been touched much really, we only refined art to look decent enough. It was designed having a mobile game in mind, but things changed, so it doesn't make much sense anymore. It's a part of the game that I really want to change, badly.


Basically, we want to get rid of most UI elements or hide them whenever it's possible to make the game as immersive as possible. So no more old fashioned icons cluttering screen.
Dialogues
Currently there are no NPC-s in game, so you are quite alone. Of course, we wan to change that and add some life and interaction. Don't expect us to add a lot of them, though. In few key-locations you will be able to talk with some characters, and depending on how you run the conversation, you will learn different things. Also, don't expect NPC-s to act like idiots and answer same question over and over again... they will rather treat You like an idiot :). So, you will have to be mindful. 


Gianni Chiarparini is an experienced music producer and composer who has collaborated successfully with popular artists, has scored for movies, commercials, documentaries and indie games. Gianni has just finished to compose the music for ""Starcrafts Mod"". He is the founder of Violet Music production where he teamed up with the very talented producer Simone Ermacora. Considering Gianni's big passion for Lovecraft (since his teenage years) and survival horror games, the match was obvious, Violet music production is composing REALLY dark ambient soundtrack for Lovecraft Tales, together with sound design. Music will play an important role in the game, so here you can have a taste of how it's going to be:




...And what's in it for you:





Sewer Hrehorowicz
I'm the creator of this game, and I've been working on it for about 3 years. Primarily I'm an artist, but I had to learn lot of different skills in order to finish what I began - like level design, sound design, game design, scripting, writing, project management to name few... But I like learning.
Edouard Bouchez
C# programmer that took challenge and has been working with me for almost 2 years, with no money... He is the most reliable person that I've ever worked with. He puts his time, energy, money and heart to this game and he is doing it at 100% like I do. For that, I will be eternally thankful.


Of course, we would not do it all alone. There were, and there are people that helped us in various ways, in most cases in exchange of profit in a distant future. It takes guts and heart to do this, so we want to honour them:


Gianni Chiarparini - he decided to compose all music and produce all sounds for game

Marek Nowak - he helped with the story a lot... really lot

Alicja Stempa - she helped with coding. You can admire day & night system and animated trees thanks to her

Evgeny Chucha - he animated the protagonist

Ted Garnie - he created some environmental artworks

Hubert Świątek - he composed the music for our previous trailer and made great jingle

Tobias Ezra Queen, Mark Talman, Paweł Mielewczyk - they provided great voiceovers
Dagmara Klimczak - she provided English translation for game

Robert Chrzanowski - he also animated the protagonist but we haven't had the chance to use it yet

Dominik Hrehorowicz - he placed all sounds in the levels and traced many bugs

And there are some people that decided to stay anonymous, although their contribution is visible and important. You may not be even aware of it...



We dedicated lot of time, energy and money for the development of Lovecraft Tales. I personally dedicated most of my time for 1,5 year, it hurt me financially. I haven't seen it coming, but it was inevitable. We released demo, but we can't go further without your support, and I personally can't do it for sure.

You can also understand that making games takes lot of money, and this time we set our goals really low because we already did a huge part of it.
We also didn't want to make deal with publisher so far, because we want to stay independent and follow our vision.
Besides that, for me personally it's a huge part of my life, that took an unimaginable amount of work and time... You don't expect that I will just give up onit away, do you?




Q: When the game will be finished?
A: It depends on stretch goals that we achieve. The more of them, the longer it'll take. I estimate 6 months for basic plan, and 1,5 year with all additional stretch goals.

Q: When I will get rewards?
A: Generally, after releasing the game. Some rewards may come earlier, though, like for example hangouts and membership site access.

Q: Why don't you promise more for that amount of money> You seem to be over-cautious
A: Yeah, I know that some people do that. You know, I'm trying to be realistic. We have some experience, we did a lot without any support, and we know how much it costs to add one simple feature. You honestly have no frickin idea.

Q: I don't like this and that, it could be done better. Why are you so sloppy?
A: Because I prefer sloppy success over perfect mediocrity. I like to get things done. You have no idea how many compromises we need to make in order to have things done.

Q: Where is your budget breakdown?
A: I won't post it because it's not fixed. We need to pay taxes, fees, rewards costs, but that's obvious. I need to have salary during development, but there are many many unpredicatble factors and we don't know yet what we will buy and what we will do. It depends on stretch goals. The more money we collect, the more people we will need to pay in general.

Q: Are there more questions to be answered?
A: Maybe, I don't know. It depends on you. Write to me if you have one, and I'll post it there.

After a year we´ve realized that we can´t continue our way like this. We´re simply too slow. So what we hope is to raise The Evil VR now and create the game full-time with the community.The mobile version of The Evil VR was simply a first version to manifest our ideas and to get the experience we needed to make in the horror genre. Many of the core mechanics of the game have been already implemented, but we want to expand them and there's still a long way to go in terms of design, content, and polish. The whole story needs to be told inside the game, with all facets of it.  We also want to bring a sound engineer on board for an awesome aural experience.The funds from this campaign will help push beyond the past and it will help us finish The Evil VR. With your support, we can finalize what we began one year ago. The Evil VR release for the PC. Let create a unique Horror-Adventure together!  Eyüp Zengin (The Machine)This guy is the heart of the team. He studied computer science and is a funny, but brilliant guy. Very young he became obsessed with computers and video games, after he bought his first graphic card, an GeForce FX5200.

But he has also worked in different areas like web development. When he is not coding, he is  designing awesome  2D and 3D content for games and media. His everyday life is basically all about games and his passion. He´s also a bit of a weirdo, in his free time he buys a huge amount of candles and nobody knows what he´s using them for. Like all of the team members, Eyüp is a creative mind and also passionate gamer.Top Games: Resident Evil 1-4, Clock Tower, Obscure, Minecraft, Anno, StarCraft, TES Oblivion, Half Life, CrysisAlexander Johannes (The Magician)This guy always has an ace up his sleeve. Alex also has studied computer science and is a actuall magician. His passion for games started early in the 90´s with the discovery of the Sega Saturn.

The teaser trailer will give you a quick overview of a few things you can expect to find in Arkalica with a more detailed description below and on our website at <a href=""http://www.arkalica.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.arkalica.com</a>. All content is still in pre-alpha and will likely be modified during development.</p><p>We have some good news for everyone that has been following us for a while and for those of you just hearing about Arkalica for the first time. None of Arkalica’s elemental specializations have been made public yet, but during this campaign we will introduce a new element each day over the course of the project’s duration in the updates section. These will be added to our website as well, so you can head on over to check them out whenever you like after the project comes to an end.</p><p>Now without further ado, here are a few things you can expect to find in Arkalica:</p><p> </p><div><h2><strong>Open World</strong></h2></div><p>In Arkalica, you decide what you want to do and where you want to go. Arkalica will continue to grow, adding more places to explore and tons of new dungeons and Lytes for you to conquer and tame. Enjoy hours of entertainment with a multitude of quest lines filled to the brim with exciting discoveries, plot twists, wit and most importantly: loot.</p><p>If you feel like you’ve seen everything Arkalica has to offer, go out and explore it again. Arkalica consists of massive areas filled with wide open spaces for you to run through and tiny nooks and crannies to explore so chances are that you missed a few things. Decide whether you want to battle along the way, or turn off encounters completely allowing you a more relaxed and casual experience.</p><p>If you’re looking for something a little more action packed, find and challenge NPCs to be granted access to a dynamic tournament. Battle and struggle your way to the top and be rewarded each and every time for your achievements. Enter one of the hundreds of dungeons and test your mettle, but just like encounters dungeons will not be a predetermined instance. Every time you re-enter a dungeon it will be different, rewarding you with not only a new experience, but with a different set of lootable items.</p><p>If it all starts feeling a little mundane and you feel like you need a change of pace then dip a toe into our massive crafting system or make it your mission to build yourself a house. Create cosmetic items and play dress-up as you search for the perfect outfit to compliment yourself and your Lytes alike. Play around with your builds, making your Lytes not only the cutest creatures to walk the face of Arkalica, but also a force to be reckoned with.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1511257276/ezcqn7lng3hq7vtcsixb.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><div><h2>Taming and Transformation System</h2></div><p>Arkalica has a unique system in place which allows you not only to capture any creature you have beaten in combat, but also enables you to transform into any creature you have tamed.</p><p>The taming system is unique in that capturing a Lyte isn’t just a straightforward action that will eventually become mundane and repetitive. Each action you take can lead to a myriad of results and you have to stay on your toes if you want to make the creature in question submit to you. Overcome peril and frustration with keen perception and strategic positioning as you adapt to your prey’s emotional state and reap the rewards when you finally succeed in taming your new companion.</p><p>Each Lyte species comes with 5 forms depending on the affinity to the elements it was born with. As an infant, or tier 1 Lyte, your companions and enemies will all be bound by two basic elements which will later on dictate the specialization elements available to it.</p><p>After gaining enough affinity with the elements, your Lyte will grow and become an adolescent, gaining a nice stat boost, but still retaining its two basic elements.</p><p>Having reached a high enough total affinity, your Lyte will mature into a tier 3, not only enjoying another nice stat boost, but also gaining access to its specializations. Each Lyte has two specializations linking back to its basic elements. Having unlocked these specializations will allow you to switch freely between them, even during combat.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1511338899/y5xmzblcakaspvwmjwhk.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><div><h1>Skill and Affinity System</h1></div><p>Affinity in Arkalica can be considered levels and essentially work in the same way. A higher affinity will allow you a bigger selection of skills and passive abilities and also improve your overall combat prowess.</p><p>Arkalica currently has 30 specializations based on the two basic elements each Lyte has. The basic elements in Arkalica consist of the water, fire, earth, air, light and darkness system seen in a myriad of worlds, but that’s basically where the similarity ends.</p><p>Each Lyte essentially has access to four elements, giving you access to 64 elemental skills and two skill bars for every Lyte you own, but that’s not all. Arkalica’s skill system will allow you to modify each skill with a separate passive tree, allowing you to not only upgrade that boring old fireball, but also giving you the option of turning it into something a little less mainstream.</p><p>Every Lyte will have a passive skill tree for each of their elemental affinities. These passive trees will allow you to upgrade your Lyte and to choose your play-style. Experiment with different combinations and change your build on the fly. On top of being able to choose a build for each and every Lyte you own, you the player will also get passive trees for every element available in game allowing you to choose your overall interaction with your Lytes and the elements they wield.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://arkalica.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/combat2.gif"" src=""""/> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><div><h1>Combat</h1></div><p>Every combat system out there just feels a little lacking after a while, even when it itself is not at fault. Combat starts to feel mundane and repetitive and no amount of new content ever feels like it truly made much of a difference. In Arkalica, we’ve done away with these combat systems and instead created our own.</p><p>Each encounter will be instanced based, but not predetermined.

The teaser trailer will give you a quick overview of a few things you can expect to find in Arkalica with a more detailed description below and on our website at www.arkalica.com. All content is still in pre-alpha and will likely be modified during development.We have some good news for everyone that has been following us for a while and for those of you just hearing about Arkalica for the first time. None of Arkalica’s elemental specializations have been made public yet, but during this campaign we will introduce a new element each day over the course of the project’s duration in the updates section. These will be added to our website as well, so you can head on over to check them out whenever you like after the project comes to an end.Now without further ado, here are a few things you can expect to find in Arkalica: Open WorldIn Arkalica, you decide what you want to do and where you want to go. Arkalica will continue to grow, adding more places to explore and tons of new dungeons and Lytes for you to conquer and tame. Enjoy hours of entertainment with a multitude of quest lines filled to the brim with exciting discoveries, plot twists, wit and most importantly: loot.If you feel like you’ve seen everything Arkalica has to offer, go out and explore it again. Arkalica consists of massive areas filled with wide open spaces for you to run through and tiny nooks and crannies to explore so chances are that you missed a few things. Decide whether you want to battle along the way, or turn off encounters completely allowing you a more relaxed and casual experience.If you’re looking for something a little more action packed, find and challenge NPCs to be granted access to a dynamic tournament. Battle and struggle your way to the top and be rewarded each and every time for your achievements. Enter one of the hundreds of dungeons and test your mettle, but just like encounters dungeons will not be a predetermined instance. Every time you re-enter a dungeon it will be different, rewarding you with not only a new experience, but with a different set of lootable items.If it all starts feeling a little mundane and you feel like you need a change of pace then dip a toe into our massive crafting system or make it your mission to build yourself a house. Create cosmetic items and play dress-up as you search for the perfect outfit to compliment yourself and your Lytes alike. Play around with your builds, making your Lytes not only the cutest creatures to walk the face of Arkalica, but also a force to be reckoned with. Taming and Transformation SystemArkalica has a unique system in place which allows you not only to capture any creature you have beaten in combat, but also enables you to transform into any creature you have tamed.The taming system is unique in that capturing a Lyte isn’t just a straightforward action that will eventually become mundane and repetitive. Each action you take can lead to a myriad of results and you have to stay on your toes if you want to make the creature in question submit to you. Overcome peril and frustration with keen perception and strategic positioning as you adapt to your prey’s emotional state and reap the rewards when you finally succeed in taming your new companion.Each Lyte species comes with 5 forms depending on the affinity to the elements it was born with. As an infant, or tier 1 Lyte, your companions and enemies will all be bound by two basic elements which will later on dictate the specialization elements available to it.After gaining enough affinity with the elements, your Lyte will grow and become an adolescent, gaining a nice stat boost, but still retaining its two basic elements.Having reached a high enough total affinity, your Lyte will mature into a tier 3, not only enjoying another nice stat boost, but also gaining access to its specializations. Each Lyte has two specializations linking back to its basic elements. Having unlocked these specializations will allow you to switch freely between them, even during combat. Skill and Affinity SystemAffinity in Arkalica can be considered levels and essentially work in the same way. A higher affinity will allow you a bigger selection of skills and passive abilities and also improve your overall combat prowess.Arkalica currently has 30 specializations based on the two basic elements each Lyte has. The basic elements in Arkalica consist of the water, fire, earth, air, light and darkness system seen in a myriad of worlds, but that’s basically where the similarity ends.Each Lyte essentially has access to four elements, giving you access to 64 elemental skills and two skill bars for every Lyte you own, but that’s not all. Arkalica’s skill system will allow you to modify each skill with a separate passive tree, allowing you to not only upgrade that boring old fireball, but also giving you the option of turning it into something a little less mainstream.Every Lyte will have a passive skill tree for each of their elemental affinities. These passive trees will allow you to upgrade your Lyte and to choose your play-style. Experiment with different combinations and change your build on the fly. On top of being able to choose a build for each and every Lyte you own, you the player will also get passive trees for every element available in game allowing you to choose your overall interaction with your Lytes and the elements they wield.  CombatEvery combat system out there just feels a little lacking after a while, even when it itself is not at fault. Combat starts to feel mundane and repetitive and no amount of new content ever feels like it truly made much of a difference. In Arkalica, we’ve done away with these combat systems and instead created our own.Each encounter will be instanced based, but not predetermined. Enemies, skill sets, environment and the type of battle will be randomly determined at the start of an encounter. Even two Lytes of the same species with the same affinity levels won’t be the same, but will come with stat and skill set differences. This will remain true for dungeons as well, the only difference being that the entire dungeon will count as an encounter. Dungeons aren’t hard-coded and the amount and type of enemies will vary on each subsequent visit.Actual combat will involve basic attacks, more powerful charged attacks, evasion techniques, movement abilities, blocking, and your eight elemental skills. Almost every action will rely on a stamina pool which regenerates while in combat, but will never render you incapable of surviving a fight.A player is limited to carrying three Lytes at a time, giving a possible combination of 12 elements and an arsenal of 48 chosen skills at any given time with which to beat your enemies into submission. Each Lyte has the ability to switch freely between unlocked specializations during combat, giving you a second skillset and allowing you to adapt to almost any situation on the fly.And have we mentioned that you can even use the environment to your advantage? You'll have environmental interaction available during combat allowing you to scale walls, springboard and pull off some insane, never before seen moves as you pummel your enemies into oblivion.  Player Housing and Farming SystemsTraveling the world isn’t half as satisfying as having a place to return to at the end of the day. As part of the introduction to the game, the player will be given a little plot of land on which to build themselves a place to rest their aching feet.This little piece of land can be expanded as the player progresses through the game, enabling them to turn the newly obtained space into farmland, a mine or two, a beautiful garden and that’s just to name a few. Gather resources and craft furniture and tools to make life easier for both you and your Lytes.In Arkalica the basic elements even govern something as simple as planting a field of crops. Make use of your Lytes to help you out around your farm and eventually train them to do the work by themselves while you are out exploring the world.Fishing in Arkalica is nice, easy and relaxing. All you need is a rod, some bait, a place to drop your line and maybe a good book or two. Or train your Lytes to catch fish on their own allowing you to sit back and take a load off.The farming and fishing systems both come with their own passive trees and affinity levels, allowing you to mold your experience to better suit your needs. Cooking completes the set as a possible avenue for processing raw ingredients into something a little more useful either for use or for making a little money. Crafting and Gathering ResourcesResources in Arkalica can be gathered in a myriad of ways. The easiest and most common way of obtaining items will be through combat. Enemies will drop both normal materials and valuables upon defeat.

Project Retrograde is a multiplayer twin stick brawler with a twist where bullets don’t kill, but the environment does. All weapons cannot directly damage the players, but they will instantly die when they touch any red walls or objects in the map.



 
Use physics to your advantage by using your own weapon’s recoil to evade or propel yourself to great speeds. Utilize bullets’ ricochet, push boxes, and body slam others to win.




Varieties of weapons are available. Some weapons just shoot bullets, some bounces back bullets, some are just there to screw with you. Machine guns, railguns, shotguns, we got'em all and more to come.​






 
This game features online & local multiplayer, play with friends on the same PC with multiple controllers, or use LAN or Internet to play with other people. Each PC supports up to 4 controllers (4 players) and can join any online match with up to 6 players.
 


 
Arenas or “Maps” will determine the experience of the match. Each arena has their own layout, and some have unique quirks that requires different strategies to win the game. We are planning to release 10 maps initially on launch and then updating additional maps after that.
 



Unlock and choose different textures, thrusters and particle effects to personalize your ship. Look different and show off your achievements online.

 



 
 








 
 


 
 


 
 





 

“This is a very fun party game, I like the fact that you struggle with the the recoil control that adds fun to the flavour of the game. The art is also really attractive, this is one of the very few games that actually pull off tron like graphics really well""
- Wan Hazmer, Lead Designer Final Fantasy 15, 2018


“Something that would make you ROFL with your friends, or wreck friendships altogether simply because of the ensuing rage”
- Pladidus Santoso, Senior Editor of/at Jagat Play, 2018




 
 


 
 




 
We've been working on this for a year with our own funds. We use crowdfunding funds as final push and too add more content to the game. We already have plans to add more features, maps, modes, weapons & customization, but our focus for now is to finish the game first. Any extra funds above the goal will be put towards developing more contents & features for the game. Those extra contents and features will be released for free at launch or at later updates.


The Polished game, complete with 10 Levels and Online Multiplayer



More songs to pump out your adrenaline in the game. We plan to collaborate with the composer of the current songs in the game.



No controllers to play together? With the smartphone controller it’s easier than ever to play together. The Mobile controller would be distributed as an app to download with various customization options.




Create your own levels and play together. Boost your creativity and create your own levels with Level Editor.




  
We don’t have any perks that offer merchandise, soundtracks, or any additional stuff outside the game itself, we want to focus on making a fun game & delivering it to you first. In turn, we can give you multiple copies of the game discounted for you to share with your friends, family, stranger or whoever you want to play with.


We really appreciate the help you give on our game. We’ll work hard to deliver the game! Your name will be on the credits



Lone wolves out there need not worry. Play locally or online to compete with more people. You will get a copy of the game when it is released, Early Access, and your name on the credits.

EliteGameCom Story:

Battle on the terrain:

We have already made eight different spaceships (from small to huge):
Nirvana is the most powerful ship at the moment. Only it can be equipped with the most destructive Laser Annihilator and quantum powerful Shield Magx. This ship was created to establish your power in this stellar system and easily destroy clusters of smaller ships. Also, its interior decoration is not comparable to any ship. This is the most expensive ship in the game at the moment:

Captain's cabin:

With the separate shower, desk and panoramic window:

Hangar for shuttles:

Captain's bridge with the large panorama window:

This spaceship saved our hero when he drifted in space near Saturn:

This spaceship you can get with the 40% discount now (see perks). It will help establish your control over profitable galactic routes and trade stations, since new pilots (who will come after) will start from the Earth and Mars, passing these ways to the distant stars.
There are some unique possibilities of how you can upgrade your ship, regardless of whether you acquired the ship Nirvana or not. They are available for purchase only here (in perks) and will not be available to other players for purchase in the game itself:


Unique Energy Device will help to equip the weaker ship with powerful lasers and shields. (each ship has the limitations on the installation of more powerful lasers and shields and this Energy Device will help to bypass it).

Incredible hyperdrive amplifier that will make your jump to the distant stars of the galaxy almost instant (saving your time) and there is no need to stop for refueling at every star on the way to the distant stars.

You can also order the Space station in the orbit of the planets of stars located near by to the solar system. It gives you a profitable financial advantage because all pilots start their journey from the solar system and the probability of trade in goods at your stations near neighboring stars is much higher (note: the owner of the station receives a percentage of the trade of other players at his station).
Agreements governing how you get purchased stations:

In the orbit of the planet there can be only one space station
If you purchase a station before others, it will be economically profitable as it will be closer to the solar system.

   We achieved the main goal as we have designed the system for a large number of users and managed to create one of the fastest server solutions and our studio succeeded in this.
   How did we achieve this? A significant part of our specialists worked for more than ten years as engineers to improve the speed of Oracle, MS SQL and other databases. Many of us have devoted our lives to creating games and for decades worked as programmers in the computer industry.

<p>The game is a <b>character progression RPG</b> game, in which you
manage your character’s development. The goal is making your character as
strong as possible <b>during the PVP sessions</b>. Of course <b>PVP is not mandatory</b>,
playing the game with no PVP at all is a very fun experience too. We want to
give you more content than our rivals do, even from the start. Also we are
giving special attention to the visual content, we want it to be <b>completely
unique and artistic</b>. To avoid any misunderstandings, I’m going to specify some
games that are similar to ours: Shakes &amp; Fidget and Zero Hero. These are
the ones that worth the mentioning, huge respect to the developers.</p>
<p>You’ll find <b>a lot of innovation</b> in our game, which you can
read about below. <b>We don’t follow the ordinary system</b> that represents today’s
RPGs, instead we worked out a completely new system for you, so that the game
we are working on can give you a unique experience. </p>
<div>It is very important to mention, that the amount of money we targeted in the campaign is the minimum amount of money for us to keep working on the game, and it only covers the salary of the developers by now. If you want this game published as soon as possible, than we need much more money so we can pay off the developers.</div>

</div></div>","The game is a character progression RPG game, in which you
manage your character’s development. The goal is making your character as
strong as possible during the PVP sessions. Of course PVP is not mandatory,
playing the game with no PVP at all is a very fun experience too. We want to
give you more content than our rivals do, even from the start. Also we are
giving special attention to the visual content, we want it to be completely
unique and artistic. To avoid any misunderstandings, I’m going to specify some
games that are similar to ours: Shakes & Fidget and Zero Hero. These are
the ones that worth the mentioning, huge respect to the developers.
You’ll find a lot of innovation in our game, which you can
read about below. We don’t follow the ordinary system that represents today’s
RPGs, instead we worked out a completely new system for you, so that the game
we are working on can give you a unique experience. 
It is very important to mention, that the amount of money we targeted in the campaign is the minimum amount of money for us to keep working on the game, and it only covers the salary of the developers by now. If you want this game published as soon as possible, than we need much more money so we can pay off the developers.

You can also help us by sharing the game with your friends, relatives.


***Every visual component of the game is hand made and it requires a lot of hard work and effort.***







You'll have 5 types of stat points, which will bring revolutionary new opportunities:


After every level you'll receive 5 stat points (Strange, Agility, Dexterity, Stamina, Critic)
You won't have to choose from any classes (for ex.: warrior,defender,rogue,etc.), instead you'll have the opportunity to progress your character in any direction you want





The values will be calculated from the stat points, which will have a very big role in fights.You will have to vary these values if you decide to improve your character in a specific way. We wanted to give the players the opportunity to decide in which way they want to improve their character.



Action points will be needed to enter Common Locations. These have two types:

Free: There are 10 free action points and they regenerate in 15 minutes if you use one of them.
Premium:  There are 5 premium action points which regenerate faster than the free action points, but only if you have at least one active premium action point.












There will be a lot of equipments and much more will be added soon.
On every level there will be 1488 equipment variations in 5 different rarities.



In the future updates we would like to introduce the equipment sets, which will bring much more equipments.
We design character portraits for a lot of tastes, for you to find the one you like the most.Every armor will have 6 parts and you'll have the opportunity to use your character's hands in any way you wish:


One one-handed weapon + shield
Two one-handed weapons
One two-handed weapon
The armors will be categorized by their material, which means we'll have 6 different armor types.On bigger levels (20+) you'll have the chance to place gems in your equipments to strengthen them.
(The picture below represents the inventory screen)



For example, the character behind the equipment slots was made like this:




The looting will have a big role which will have some consequences:

There will be no trading between players, you'll have to fight for your own equipments.
We split the fighting in two categories: Common and Dungeon locations. Dungeon locations will have better drop rate. You will have to pay with Dungeon Coins to enter Dungeon locations (You can read about Dungeon Coins below).
(The picture below is just a sketch of the locations tab)






PVP will have a big role:


We took PVP very serious and tried to prevent the higher level players from taking advantage of the lower level players
Players receive Dungeon Coins from PVP, which can be used to enter Dungeon Locations
The PVP will be broken down to 10 levels and the top 10 rated players will receive bonuses from time to time (only if they can remain in their current position)

In the future updates we will introduce the portals, which will work on a survival based system, for high drop rates in exchange

The Main Event timer starts at 30-minutes and counts down to zero. Once the timer is below 1 minute, the timer resets to 1 minute each time a member presses the Grab button.

Lack of member damage activity allows the boss monster's time to heal up before being attacked again, so stay engaged and work together to take down the monsters.

With the support from contributors in reaching our campaign goal, HeroGrab will be able to support an amazing product line to offer its members, allow the ability to create a company store with uniquely line of nerd products, ability to support a superior marketing campaign in order share the fun with the world, and support future design /development concepts. How Does it Work?We wanted to make an environment that was simple to understand and allow our members to jump in and have fun right away. This is done by simply signing up to become a member, acquiring a Grab Pack and participate in any event you would like.The Main Event is where you can win the amazing products that were voted on by members and currently available to win. This is done by being the last person to Grab a product before the timer hits 0.Each time you place a grab it will display your username as the next winner. The Main Event timer starts at 30-minutes and counts down to zero. Once the timer is below 1 minute, the timer resets to 1 minute each time a member presses the Grab button. This allows another user the opportunity to grab if interested. To increase the skill difficulty, the more grabs that are placed in a single event and the more activity the main event receives, the less time is applied on the clock. Allowing skilled players and hot items to be won faster.HeroGrab also has created 2 other unique and exclusive interactive features, the Battle Arena and Epic Item Unlock. Each Grab credit used applies damage to the HeroGrab Monster in the Boss Battle Arena. The more time that remains on the clock when the Grab button is placed, the more damage is applied and the quicker the boss is defeated. But be careful! Lack of member damage activity allows the boss monster's time to heal up before being attacked again, so stay engaged and work together to take down the monsters. Each Grab also helps HeroGrab unlock the next Epic Item (A rare and high-value item that will be moved to the main event and rewarded to a future skilled member. Other Sweet FeaturesWe built in a voting system for you to participate in and ensure HeroGrab products are what you want every time!We built an alert system so you can be notified when the product you want to win is now listed on the main event!We love when our members win, so we have a few locations where we display our recent HeroGrab winners and High Score members.Main Event Product Line Up - All products that are listed on HeroGrab will always compete against one another, and the members are the ones who vote to control which one will win. In order for us to offer an amazing product lineup, we need the help of you to make that possible.We will use these funds to get the starting products on the site and prepared to be won by our members!Company Store and Products -We will also be launching our own company store that will sell HeroGrab branded products to show off to all your friends as well as some unique loot you know and love. Some of the products we will be creating are Shirts, Phone Cases, cups, sweaters, gamer gear, comic books, and more.These funds will help support the customized design, development, printing and stock supplies needed in order to get this portion of the site off the ground.Marketing Campaign - These funds will help use launch multiple social media and local marketing campaigns, to include videos, banners, and even our own live streaming Twitch.tv account. With each of these campaigns, we will be giving away a ton of free stuff and exclusive offers.If we don't meet our goal number, that's ok! We are just as invested in this project as you are. We will still make sure the items above will be completed eventually, it just may mean that it will take a little longer to deliver than expected. The Impact We put in the time, drive, and preparation to start this business. From countless hours in designing, to internal web development and customized functionality, we will be ready to launch this experience soon. With your help, we will launch it even sooner than expected and offer our members an amazing list of products to ensure its excitement and success. I (Mark) have been fortunate enough that for a majority of my career, I have been able to assist in the growth and development of some amazing project outputs for some of the top companies in the world. On top of developing solutions and ensuring that project development is met by the expected deadlines.I have an ability to simplify complex ideas, articulate forecasted project milestones, and produce results that exceed the original standards while improving the team's morale and productivity.

<p>Hello, we are small team called Empty Inventory. We are here on IndieGoGo to show you a glimpse of our upcoming game: Blue Traces In Outer Space. It's a 2D Spacesim with visual novel elements. Keep in mind that what you are about to witness is only an early prototype of the game and the sprites and gameplay are subject to change throughout development, however, we assure you that this will be at least somewhat similar to the final product.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
</div><div>
<p>Blue Traces is set in a bleak neo-80s cyberpunk future where large megacorporations colonize space and use proxy political factions to influence and control society for their personal gain. You play as a simple mercenary in the criminal underworld trying to scrape together a living in an oversaturated and dangerous market who somehow gets tangled into a mess of threads involving some of the most powerful players in the galaxy.</p>

<p>In terms of gameplay, our main design philosophy is to create a varied and interesting experience through different gameplay styles and endings.

<p><b>FAQ</b></p>
<p><b>Requirements?</b><br/>
It is a browser based game, so any computer or device with internet access and
modern internet browser like Chrome or FireFox. Game will work on Windows XP or

<p><b>Multiplayer?</b><br/>
In current base version, no. There are plans in near future, if the game will
get enough interest.</p>
<p><b>Release date?</b><br/>
Early alpha state with forest/fields location within a month for backers. Public
beta state within a month later. Each new location (guaranteed if funded) within
another month later. Some delays are always possible.</p>

guaranteed. Later, if this game will still get noticable positive response from 
current and arriving new users, there is no reason to kill it. It will be a

Remember that game is browser based. Your game
progress will be stored on a server with daily backup. There is always very
small chance for server technical malfunction (not available), but I am using
professional hosts with quick response to such situations. Used system is
flexible, but I will run additional resources if needed.
FAQ
Requirements?
It is a browser based game, so any computer or device with internet access and
modern internet browser like Chrome or FireFox. Game will work on Windows XP or
later, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS, and probably something else.
Multiplayer?
In current base version, no. There are plans in near future, if the game will
get enough interest.
Release date?
Early alpha state with forest/fields location within a month for backers. Public
beta state within a month later. Each new location (guaranteed if funded) within
another month later. Some delays are always possible.
How long this game will be supported?If minimum for base game will be funded, then 2 years of support are 
guaranteed. Later, if this game will still get noticable positive response from 
current and arriving new users, there is no reason to kill it. It will be a 
reason for new extension updates. It is also possible that it might be released 
as standard desktop and mobile game.",3.0,0,"2 Campaigns

will hire an artist to work with us throughout the entire development

replace all the existing art in the game and will be responsible for
creating new graphical elements, which means we will
dedicate more of our time to programming the game. Currently we have
a limited amount of building models, which is why many of them repeat
in different districts of the city. Moreover, even those models leave
a lot to be desired. However, with the help of an artist, we will be
able to diversify the city and make it look more alive. The result
will be improved graphics and animations of the game.</p>

<b><br/></b></p><h1><b>Story:</b></h1>
<p>
The main character in this game is a lonely emigrant from a country
where it is near impossible to find a job. Without family or friends
to support him, his only choice is to leave his country and go abroad
looking for better opportunities. Our hero has worked honestly and
responsibly until one day the economic crisis caught up with him even
here. An entire country is hit by a crisis and faces a default.
People are losing their jobs, businesses close and our hero is laid
off and left with no roof over his head and no without possibility to
secure his livelihood. He has no choice but to adapt and seek new ways
of surviving below the poverty line.</p><p><br/></p>

</p>
Let me give you an example of how the demand system works. Let us
look at the demand for food. If the demand for food is not saturated
for a long time it leads to starvation. A prolonged state of <b><i><strike></strike></i></b>starvation leads
to one of the three states, one of which is debility. Debility is an
evolution of a physical demand. Debility may lead to a loss of
consciousness, evolution of the sleep demand or it can worsen the
psychological state of the character. The evolution of the sleep
demand, in turn, leads to a further worsening of the emotional and
physical states of the character. The evolution of the psychological
state of the character leads to a further worsening of the
psychological state, which may cause panic, meltdown, random mood
swings, hallucinations and so on. All of these states will be more
comprehensible in-game than they appear in reading. 
<br/>
<br/><p>
What we have as a result is a system, where each of the demands that
character has influences all other demands. Food saturation affects
physical strength, physical strength affects the demand for sleep,
sleep affects psychological state. </p><p><b><a href=""http://oms-slump.wix.com/game"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""http://media.wix.com/ugd/c2018b_c20509dd820d49d99c2ab7d9f6340d0c.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Demand system PDF</a></b></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1255506/files/20150228032411-need_system_eng_1.jpg?1425122651"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1255508/files/20150228032419-ENG_need_system_1.jpg?1425122659"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1255509/files/20150228032425-ENG_need_system_2.jpg?1425122665"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>

Here are some of the goals we set in case we get over-funded: Until the current stage of Entropy’s fall, Poor Small Studio has been a team of two who have borne the brunt (very enthusiastically!) of everything that goes into making of a game; from developing it, to quality assurance, graphics, editing, etc. But we need more people in our team: people who can love Entropy’s Fall with a similar passion, people who are skilled and have the talent to contribute and nurture our lovechild into being a memorable game for everyone. It has been difficult journey so far but we have turned the odds and developed Entropy’s Fall to what it is today. We already have a few people who can help us create what we wish to, but we lack financial resources. Once we have that, we are more than confident that we will not disappoint you and deliver what we promise! We understand that some of you might like Entropy’s Fall but are not able to back us with your contribution…  firstly, we thank you for appreciating our work!!!..And secondly, we have GOOD NEWS!!! You can still contribute by spreading a word about Entropy’s Fall in your circle of family, friends and social network. Contribute your social network instead of money! Even if we are able to reach one backer through your support, it will help us a lot!! Just click on the Indiegogo share tools and shout out to your peeps on facebook, twitter, instagram, google+, snapchat, etc.! Sugam Kher is a college drop out and a tech and gaming enthusiast who has devoted everything into making this game. He's solely responsible for Character Design, Animation, Music Design, A.I. Programming and Lighting for Entropy's Fall. A former musician, science lover and a regular gamer. He worked as a game tester for Ubisoft India for 2 years before he started out as an Indie. Vansh is an 18-year-old who wanted to be a game developer since he first heard of such a profession. He is solely responsible for Sound Effects, Lead Level Design, Particles and Camera work for Entropy's Fall. Apart from working on the game Vansh likes taking part in a lot of MUNs (Model United Nations) and in his free time be the gamer that he is. He also likes reading manga and watching animes. Sejal Parashar is a lawyer with masters in Intellectual Property with a bunch of experience in taxation. Her efficiency and organized work ethics are what carry the burden of an otherwise chilled-out team of PSS to the finish line. She's handled the PR and Marketing for the game on a 0$ budget. Away from work she likes to dance, chill and hang out with Sugam. Is there going to be multi-player or co-op?We do plan to launch a Multi-player version but only if we get over-funded to a large extent. So it is safe to assume that for now, Entropy’s Fall will be a single player experience. We do not plan to have co-op features in the game.  What platforms will the game be released on? Will there be a DRM-free option? With the current funding amount, the game will be released for PC/MAC/Linux. Xbox One and PS4 versions are planned as over-funding goals.Entropy’s Fall will be completely DRM-free.What will the international shipping costs for the physical rewards be?International Shipping Costs are not included in the perk amount and will be payable by the backer at the time of shipment of the physical awards. We will get in touch with the backer and send them a link to pay for shipping at the time of dispatch.Shipping rates will depend on the location of the backer and the product. It will range from 10$ - 20$.What will be the delivery date for digital content (wallpapers, digital art, etc.)?Desktop wallpapers will be delivered to the backers by July 2017. All other digital content such as OST, Manual/ Guide, etc. will be delivered at the time of release approximately in November 2018.How confident are you in your delivery date?Game development is a very difficult task and requires a lot of planning and foresight and you can never predict unforeseen circumstances that may cause delays in the game's release. That being said, we at PSS have gained some experience while developing the prototype and are confident that we will deliver the product on the mentioned date.If I live outside India and want to add on an additional tier, do I have to pay the additional tier’s shipping fee?No.Can I upgrade my pledge later?Yes.Will there be a physical release of the game after it comes out?No physical copies are planned as yet.What about customs for international shipping?We would suggest that you inquire about the customs before ordering a perk with physical goods in it. Given that we are looking to ship our rewards all over the world, it is difficult for us to comment on the customs situation in each country. In case you are unsure about the custom duty implication, we advise that you avoid the perks with physical content in it. However, if you are interested to back us with a particular perk containing physical rewards, you can get in touch with us and we will work out something to offer you instead of the physical reward.For any other queries, please write to us as poorsmallstudio@gmail.com and we will get back to you at the earliest!",39.0,1,"1 Campaign

Citizens are advised to take the following steps:  Stay alert to news media events or local emergency alert notifications. Avoid contact with the infected, if evacuation isn't possible, move indoors and initiate in-place sheltering. Use a gasmask or if none are available, cover your mouth and nose with a clean cloth that has been soaked with a solution of 1 cup water and 1 tablespoon of baking soda. Also, cover bare skin and make sure that cuts and abrasions are covered. If exposed, remove clothes and seal in a plastic bag, immediately wash off using copious amounts of  warm soapy water or a diluted 10 to 1 bleach solution. Since biological agents are being used to combat the outbreak, be sure to shut the windows and air-intake vents to your shelter. If possible, stay upwind from the source of biological  agents. Seek medical attention as quickly as possible after coming in contact with the infected or a biological agent. If evacuated, do NOT return home until local authorities say it is safe. Upon arriving home, open up all the windows and doors to provide natural ventilation. Do not attempt to try mechanical ventilation, such as: electric fans, as an explosive threat may be present. Find out from local authorities how to clean up your land and property.

<h2><b>The Game:</b></h2>
<p>In Xio: Survival you play as one of five available characters, you begin your journey at a basecamp, with no clothes, lack of supplies, and little knowledge when it comes to the wilderness. You have the ability to create a private server and invite friends, or join a multiplayer server to test what a real-life outbreak feels like. Trust is hard to come by, finding allies can be nearly impossible. All players roam the Alaskan wilderness freely. </p>
<p>Xio: Survival will be a player-driven community based experience, where the development team will take all criticism, negative/positive feedback we receive, to improve the game. We strive to develop the best survival experience for players that we possibly can. As a small team, we need our community to be as vocal as possible. Support comes in many forms, whether financial, constructive, or by social media distribution. We appreciate all of the support we've received and continue to receive.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Xio fans, we need your help in continuing development. Our team has devoted countless hours to provide a lot of content in a short amount of time. We look forward to continuing to add more and making this your go-to survival experience. That being said, in order to keep working at this pace we need funding. Funding will go towards the progression of the game. Ultimately if we receive the funding needed we will continue to devote most of our time to the production of this game. Unfortunately, if we do not receive the funding needed we will need to devote time to something more financially productive, this will slow the final release of the game drastically. We are excited for you to join this survival experience and nobody likes to wait years for a game to release. Help us get it to you sooner! </p>
