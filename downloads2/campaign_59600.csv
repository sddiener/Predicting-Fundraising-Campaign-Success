<p>Developed by Dr. Achilleas Gravanis, Professor of
Pharmacology at University of Crete’s School of Medicine, <i>MicroNeurotrophins</i>
appear to mimic the beneficial properties of neurotrophins—naturally occurring
proteins that help motor neurons develop, grow, function, signal, and even
repair themselves—but are also small enough to pass through the blood brain
barrier and reach the motor neurons affected by ALS/MND. By contrast,
ALS causes motor neurons to degenerate and die and ALS/MND patients experience a
profound loss of neurotrophins as the disease progresses.</p>
<p></p>
<p>MicroNeurotrophins have proven highly effective and
non-toxic in experimental animal models of three major human neurodegenerative
diseases: Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease. This
initial research indicates that MicroNeurotrophins hold great promise
for treating ALS/MND because they target the multiple pathways of motor neuron
degeneration that are characteristic of the disease. </p>
<p><b>How
do <i>MicroNeurotrophins</i> address the multiple pathways of ALS/MND?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Anti-Apoptotic</b><br/><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Apoptosis, programmed cell death, is responsible for motor neuron degeneration in ALS/MND. In both in vitro (cell culture) and in vivo (animal model) studies, MicroNeurotrophins have been shown to combat apoptosis by protecting and strengthening neurons. </span></p>
<p><b>Anti-Inflammatory and Autoimmune Inhibitor<br/></b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Inflammation is the immune system’s defense against bacteria, viruses, and substances that are foreign and harmful. However, there is increasing evidence that inflammation accompanies the death of motor neurons in ALS/MND. MicroNeurotrophins’ powerful anti-inflammatory properties may help reduce, prevent, or even reverse this destructive autoimmune response.</span></p>
<b>Glutamate Modulator<br/></b>ALS/MND patients are unable to properly regulate glutamate, a chemical that carries messages throughout the brain and spinal cord. Too much glutamate in the brain can be toxic and cause motor neurons to die. MicroNeurotrophins serve as an indirect protectant against excess glutamate through their ability to promote cell survival processes, increase neuronal signaling strength and as an autoimmune modulator.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<b>Neuronal Signaling<br/></b>In ALS/MND, loss of neurotrophic signaling causes neurons to die. MicroNeurotrophins prevent cell death by increasing neuroprotective signals that help neurons survive, differentiate, and grow.<br/>

<p>It will cost $4.5 million dollars to bring this medication to human clinical trial in just 12-18 months. ALS Worldwide has already raised $600,000 and is leading a fundraising effort to raise the additional $3.9 million needed for the FDA and EMA required efficacy and safety studies.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Participating universities have generously
agreed to waive their facilities and administrative
fees to show their shared commitment to the research effort and to reduce the
total project budget.  By doing so, the
partnering institutions have collectively contributed roughly $1.3 million to
the overall fundraising campaign.</p>

We are asking the global community to help us raise $1.4 million in the next 2 months. That’s a little more than one-third of what’s needed. At the same time, w<span style=""background-color: initial;"">e will continue to pursue traditional philanthropy
and institutional grants to reach our overall funding goal of $3.9 million. </span><b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">100% of all donations are tax-deductible (in US) and go directly to </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">the efforts of the ALS MicroNeurotrophin Research Consortium.</span></b>

<p><span style=""line-height: 30px;""><b></b></span></p>
<p>In the United States, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is
commonly known as Lou Gehrig’s disease, named after the legendary Yankees
baseball player who died from ALS in 1941. In the United Kingdom and other
parts of the world, ALS is often called Motor Neurone Disease (MND). ALS/MND is a neurodegenerative disease that causes the neurons in the brain, brain stem
and spinal cord to degenerate and die, which leads to muscle weakness,
paralysis, and death. ALS can strike anyone and is typically fatal within 2-5
years of diagnosis, but about 10 percent of individuals survive for 10 or more
years.</p>

About MicroNeurotrophins




Developed by Dr. Achilleas Gravanis, Professor of
Pharmacology at University of Crete’s School of Medicine, MicroNeurotrophins
appear to mimic the beneficial properties of neurotrophins—naturally occurring
proteins that help motor neurons develop, grow, function, signal, and even
repair themselves—but are also small enough to pass through the blood brain
barrier and reach the motor neurons affected by ALS/MND. By contrast,
ALS causes motor neurons to degenerate and die and ALS/MND patients experience a
profound loss of neurotrophins as the disease progresses.

MicroNeurotrophins have proven highly effective and
non-toxic in experimental animal models of three major human neurodegenerative
diseases: Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease. This
initial research indicates that MicroNeurotrophins hold great promise
for treating ALS/MND because they target the multiple pathways of motor neuron
degeneration that are characteristic of the disease. 
How
do MicroNeurotrophins address the multiple pathways of ALS/MND?


Anti-ApoptoticApoptosis, programmed cell death, is responsible for motor neuron degeneration in ALS/MND. In both in vitro (cell culture) and in vivo (animal model) studies, MicroNeurotrophins have been shown to combat apoptosis by protecting and strengthening neurons. 
Anti-Inflammatory and Autoimmune InhibitorInflammation is the immune system’s defense against bacteria, viruses, and substances that are foreign and harmful. However, there is increasing evidence that inflammation accompanies the death of motor neurons in ALS/MND. MicroNeurotrophins’ powerful anti-inflammatory properties may help reduce, prevent, or even reverse this destructive autoimmune response.
Glutamate ModulatorALS/MND patients are unable to properly regulate glutamate, a chemical that carries messages throughout the brain and spinal cord. Too much glutamate in the brain can be toxic and cause motor neurons to die. MicroNeurotrophins serve as an indirect protectant against excess glutamate through their ability to promote cell survival processes, increase neuronal signaling strength and as an autoimmune modulator.


Neuronal SignalingIn ALS/MND, loss of neurotrophic signaling causes neurons to die. MicroNeurotrophins prevent cell death by increasing neuroprotective signals that help neurons survive, differentiate, and grow.



What We Need 




 

It will cost $4.5 million dollars to bring this medication to human clinical trial in just 12-18 months. ALS Worldwide has already raised $600,000 and is leading a fundraising effort to raise the additional $3.9 million needed for the FDA and EMA required efficacy and safety studies.

Participating universities have generously
agreed to waive their facilities and administrative
fees to show their shared commitment to the research effort and to reduce the
total project budget.  By doing so, the
partnering institutions have collectively contributed roughly $1.3 million to
the overall fundraising campaign.

We are asking the global community to help us raise $1.4 million in the next 2 months. That’s a little more than one-third of what’s needed. At the same time, we will continue to pursue traditional philanthropy
and institutional grants to reach our overall funding goal of $3.9 million. 100% of all donations are tax-deductible (in US) and go directly to the efforts of the ALS MicroNeurotrophin Research Consortium.

What You Get

This grassroots fundraising campaign is led by ALS Worldwide, a small nonprofit organization based in the United States, so there is no fancy website, no motivational wristband and no rock concert. 
We have lined up some amazing perks from having your name published in the research papers to an invitation to one of the consortium partner's labs to meet the scientists and receive an exclusive tour and presentation.
Everyone who donates will receive the benefit of knowing you're helping to bring us one step closer to an effective ALS/MND treatment. 

About the Consortium



(Left to right) Barry Wein, Sarah Byer, Barbara Byer and Stephen Byer
Stephen and Barbara Byer co-founded ALS Worldwide in 2008 to honor the memory of their son Ben who died that year from ALS/MND at the age of 37. In 2013, their daughter, Sarah Byer, and her husband Barry Wein, whose grandfather also died from ALS/MND, joined the nonprofit organization to contribute their professional expertise and personal experience to ALS Worldwide’s mission.
Today, ALS Worldwide advances scientific breakthroughs by fostering collaboration and innovation among leaders from all sectors of medical research. ALS Worldwide provides free personalized support via videoconference, email, phone and in-person visits to ALS/MND patients and their loved ones in more than 85 countries.

Dr. Achilleas Gravanis



After
rigorous testing in my laboratory, our team discovered that MicroNeurotrophins hold
great promise for treating ALS because they target the multiple pathways of
motor neuron degeneration that are characteristic of the disease. However,
without scientific collaborators with expertise in ALS, I knew that my
discovery would never advance to a clinical trial. That’s why I am
grateful to ALS Worldwide for assembling the consortium and leading the
fundraising effort to underwrite our collective research.
-- Dr. Achilleas
Gravanis, December 2014
Dr. Achilleas Gravanis, Professor of Pharmacology at University of Crete’s School of Medicine will continue his work as principal investigator of MicroNeurotrophins, leading his team of scientists while providing technical assistance to the other members of the consortium.
Dr. Gravanis has served as vice-president of the Hellenic Pharmacological Society, the Hellenic Biochemical Society, and as a member of the steering committee of the European Pharmacology Network. He is a member of the Board of the Hellenic Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education and serves as the Chairman of the Biosciences Committee of the Hellenic Research and Technology Council. He is a member of the Hellenic Council of Public Health. 
Dr. Gravanis has published 120 papers in peer-reviewed journals, cited in PubMed. He is the co-founder of Bionature, established in 2003, as a spin-off of the University of Crete.


   







Dr. Ghazaleh Sadri-Vakili



I believe
that MicroNeurotrophins are one of several new exciting avenues in ALS
research. Specifically, MicroNeurotrophins show considerable promise as they
readily enter the brain and target multiple pathogenic pathways that lead to
neuronal death in ALS/MND.
I am excited to be a part of the ALS
MicroNeurotrophin Research Consortium, which includes my colleagues at Harvard
University and teams from Virginia Commonwealth
University, Penn State Hershey, The University of Sheffield’s Institute for
Translational Neuroscience (SITraN), and University of Crete. 
The
Consortium provides us with a rare and wonderful opportunity to work closely
with other experts from all across the world, each with numerous years of
experience. It is an honor to be a part of this dynamic team working
collaboratively in order to determine the therapeutic potential of
MicroNeurotrophins. I am grateful to ALS Worldwide for assembling the
Consortium and leading the fundraising effort to underwrite our collective
research. -- Dr. Ghazaleh Sadri-Vakili, December 2014

Dr. Ghazaleh Sadri-Vakili, the Director of the NeuroEpigenetics Laboratory at Massachusetts General Hospital and Assistant Professor of Neurology at Harvard Medical School will oversee the testing of MicroNeurotrophins using an ALS/MND mouse model.


                          

Dr.
James Bennett Jr., Bemiss Professor of Neurology, Psychiatry and Physiology/Biophysics
at Virginia Commonwealth University’s School of Medicine will lead the testing
of MicroNeurotrophins in stem cells genetically modified and used to generate motor neurons in a dish.

About ALS/MND

In the United States, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is
commonly known as Lou Gehrig’s disease, named after the legendary Yankees
baseball player who died from ALS in 1941. In the United Kingdom and other
parts of the world, ALS is often called Motor Neurone Disease (MND). ALS/MND is a neurodegenerative disease that causes the neurons in the brain, brain stem
and spinal cord to degenerate and die, which leads to muscle weakness,
paralysis, and death. ALS can strike anyone and is typically fatal within 2-5
years of diagnosis, but about 10 percent of individuals survive for 10 or more
years.

<h3>SELF-DEFENSE FOR EVERY WOMAN</h3>
<p>Black Belt In Heels is an online self-defense curriculum for women developed by three friends who are longtime martial arts practitioners and instructors from various disciplines. Combining elements of Taekwondo, Russian Systema, and Krav Maga, we formulated 8 self-defense techniques that every woman should know. These techniques will be demonstrated in 8 online videos, where they will be broken down and drilled for maximum efficacy. The entire curriculum will be accessible through media devices registered by a subscriber. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>GET $35 FOR $25</h3>
<p>The entire Black Belt In Heels package (8 videos) costs a one-time payment of $35. That's roughly the same price as a cup of your favorite coffee per lesson. However, if you make a $25 donation to its Indiegogo campaign now or before its launch date of May 15, you get a single access to the entire package once its up. That's $10 off the original price. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>OUR DRIVE</h3>
<p>The project came out of our desire to provide an accessible platform for women to learn basic self-defense. As longtime practitioners and instructors of different martial arts disciplines, it has been our collective frustration that not more women are enrolling themselves in self-defense classes. We identified 3 main impediments:<br/><br/>1. Lack of Accessibility<br/>- The venues and schedules of most self-defense classes are not easily accessible.<br/>2. High Cost<br/>- A regular self-defense class would cost an average membership of $100 per month or $25 per lesson.<br/>3. Overwhelming Atmosphere<br/>- Many women, specially those who don’t have any previous experience picking up a martial arts discipline, find the atmosphere of self-defense schools overwhelming.<br/><br/>To address these, we developed BLACK BELT IN HEELS as an ACCESSIBLE, AFFORDABLE, and EFFECTIVE alternative. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>SHARE IN OUR DREAM OF MAKING BASIC SELF-DEFENSE ACCESSIBLE TO EVERY WOMAN RIGHT NOW</h3>
<p>Be one of the first contributors to our Indiegogo campaign! Again, a $25 donation gives you single access to the online curriculum by May 15. Any amount in excess gives you multiple accesses, which you can give as a gift to your loved ones (where amount divided by $25 equals the number of access).</p>

But when you hear the alarm....and well – you just can't help hitting the snooze button.You lay in bed too long and end up feeling rushed, frustrated, and tired your whole day.But what if you didn't have to feel that way? What if you could get up, effortlessly and naturally, at the time you desired?What would you do with that extra hour? Would you eat breakfast? Would you meditate? Would you exercise?  The Pavlok Shock Clock 2 isn't like other alarm clocks you've tried. Other alarms rely on annoying you until you give up and get out of bed – awake -- but now in a terrible mood because of your annoying alarm.That is NOT how you want to start your day.Often, a simple touch can work much better than the sound of an alarm.The Pavlok Shock Clock 2 is the first device that uses effective, tested sensory inputs to wake you up and keep you alert.As Seen In How Does It Wake Me Up?The Shock Clock 2 uses three sensory stimuli to ensure you wake up.   The Shock Clock 2 Wake Up Trainer is the Next Evolution of the Pavlok Alarm Clock In 2015, we launched an IGG for the original Shock Clock. The Device was designed to GUARANTEE that you wake up in the morning, at the precise moment you choose, using 3 different sensory stimulus, beep, vibe, and zap.The campaign was a huge success, and we successfully fulfilled all of the units to our IndieGogo backers in 2015 (how many times has that NOT happened!!).Along with shipping the Shock Clock hardware we launched a very simple app – the Pavlok Alarm Clock app. It was (and still is) very basic: one alarm, choose your stimulus, and press save, along with Snooze Lock, a feature that disables your ability to snooze the alarm and makes you do jumping jacks to shut it off.. It's not fancy, but holy @#$% is it effective!This isn't just some crazy idea – we've had thousands of Pavlok users use the original Shock Clock to wake up quickly and feel alert every morning, and their stories are inspirational to hear. Here is what just a few Shock Clock users had to say about the basic alarm feature:    If the Shock Clock Is So Successful, Why Build A Shock Clock 2? We started with the Shock Clock, but users wanted much, much more.The Shock Clock is SIMPLE. It only lets you set alarms and lock the snooze.So we're back on IndieGogo, developing the features to make this the world's BEST alarm clock.With your help and support we can add these new features:Snooze Lock: The original Shock Clock introduced the Snooze Lock, the ability to lock the snooze and keep your alarm running until you get out of bed and do jumping jacks. Our advanced motion tracking forces you to get on your feet and get your body moving. Imagine waking up alert and ready for your day by doing 10-15 jumping jacks in order to shut-off your alarm. It might sound crazy, but man is it affective!  Advanced Snooze Lock: Shock Clock 2 will use motion tracking to know when you’re out of bed and won’t let you cheat. Advanced Jumping Jack shut-off, along with new features like QR/UPC code scanner that will make you get out of bed and leave the room to go scan a QR/UPC code in order to shut off the alarm. Accountability: Shock Clock 2 will let your friends know if you don't wake up----and if you don't get out of bed, optionally give them the ability to zap you awake. Sleep Cycle Analysis: Shock Clock 2 will have automatic sleep tracking using advanced motion detection from a 9-axis accelerometer so you can track your sleep and learn what patterns and habits you can develop to get the best night’s sleep possible! Morning Routine: Shock Clock 2 will come with a built in Morning Routine schedule so you can set the tasks that are most important for your day and make sure you get them done first thing. If you don’t do your routine, watch out, a zap is coming! Evening Routine: One of the main requests we get from Pavlok and Shock Clock users is help getting to sleep at night. Shock Clock 2 will feature an evening routine reminder that will alert you when it is time to start getting ready for bed and provide you with a checklist of items you choose to prepare for your best night’s sleep.  What Do I Get With The Shock Clock 2 Wake Up Trainer?The Shock Clock 2 comes boxed with the Shock Clock module, a wristband, and a charging cable. The wristband is a magnetic milanese band for ease of use and a stylish look. You can also order from a complete line of silicone wristbands available in 6 different colors: pink, black, blue, grey, red, and white. How Do I Use The Shock Clock 2 Wake Up Trainer?The wristband and module of the Shock Clock 2 are meant to be worn to bed at night. You set the alarm from the app (available in Android and iOS) and choose how you want to be woken up.There are four types of wake up options:1. Beep2. Vibrate3. Zap (mild electric stimulus)4. Or a combination of all three When the alarm goes off, the Shock Clock 2 will alert you to wake up using the stimulus you selected. We recommend starting with a beep or vibration to wake up, with a Zap if you don't get up with the beep or vibrate.How Do I Turn Off The Alarm?With Snooze Lock off, You can snooze/turn off the alarm from within the app, or you can short press (snooze) or long press (disable alarm) on the lighting bolt of the Shock Clock module.With Snooze Lock on, the device will require that you do jumping jacks, or scan a QR/UPC code in a different room. If you try to go back to sleep? Well...ZAP. Campaign Timeline Will the Shock Clock Wake 2 Up Trainer Help Me Get To Sleep Earlier?Dozens of our users tell the same story --- the act of using the Shock Clock makes them become morning people. They naturally begin to fall asleep earlier in the evening, converting them from night owls to morning people.If that isn’t enough we have a new Evening Routine feature that can alert you when it is time to start getting ready for bed and provides a list of items you need to do to get the best night’s sleep you’ve ever had! Why We Aren't Like Other Indiegogo Campaigns (hint: you'll actually receive your product on time)Unlike other projects we have a proven product and we have a proven team. We have built devices before, and we have already engineered this tech. With Indiegogo's support, we'll build the SOFTWARE to make this device the best alarm clock ever. The Team Behind Pavlok Shock Clock Wake Up TrainerFounder Maneesh Sethi has a solid track record as an entrepreneur: he ran the website Hack the System and invented the ""big brother"" of Shock Clock, the Pavlok which successfully raised over $280,000 in 2014 on Indiegogo, and now has been shipped to over 30,000 people globally.He also headed up the design and manufacturing of the Original Shock Clock and its successful indiegogo campaign in 2015.

It wasn’t the perfect solution, but I loved how it gave me a sense of motion throughout the day. Soon, I got an adjustable standing desk. I loved it, but found myself in a similar position. I was feeling even more stiff and restless as I stood still all day. That's when<strong> I wondered why there wasn’t a device that could help people whether they were sitting or standing.</strong></p><p><strong>I decided to take a stab at solving the problem.</strong> A week later, I had designed and built a rough prototype of the original Casper Board.

It is a BALANCE BOARD with full range ankle mobility + FOOT REST with 360° rotation IN ONE DEVICE.Burn More Calories While You WorkAccording to the Mayo Clinic, too much sitting increases the risk of obesity, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. However, studies have shown that ""active sitting"" can increase blood circulation, boost oxygen levels in the body, and burn 20% more calories. Casper Boards makes it easy to sit or stand actively throughout the day.   Move During The Workday For A Healthy Heart Without movement, too much sitting increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, obesity and cancer. With the Casper Board, you can easily introduce movement into your day so you don't have to be sedentary and immobile. You can sit or stand and be moving.      Unconscious Movement When Sitting Or StandingCasper Boards promotes unconscious movement, offering a new and unique way to stay active while sitting down at your desk and burn calories. PLUS in just a few seconds, you can attach our patent-pending module to switch your board from an active sitting device to an active standing device to work your core.  A Compact Fidget Toy For Your FeetAh…so familiar. The restless feeling that gets us roaming the office for a cup of coffee at 2pm. The Casper Board is a fidget toy for your moving feet. Movement increases oxygen levels which has been shown to improve cognitive function - Find focus naturally while you pivot, twist, and move the board up to 360 degrees in any direction. Durable & Easy to UseThe wood platform was inspired by a skateboard. It's designed it to be stylish, functional and sturdy, and it's made from the highest quality of wood to ensure it can withstand anything. Components are easy to switch out and lock into place, making it the perfect companion to standing desks that lift and lower at the press of a button.       Testimonials  We’re a team of skateboarding, Crossfit, and wellness enthusiasts who have come together to create an active workplace device that lets us keep moving throughout the day.

I used to ride my skateboard to work and use it as a movable footrest under my desk. It wasn’t the perfect solution, but I loved how it gave me a sense of motion throughout the day. Soon, I got an adjustable standing desk. I loved it, but found myself in a similar position. I was feeling even more stiff and restless as I stood still all day. That's when I wondered why there wasn’t a device that could help people whether they were sitting or standing.I decided to take a stab at solving the problem. A week later, I had designed and built a rough prototype of the original Casper Board. It was a skateboard with plastic balls zip-tied to the bottom and I liked how it let me move my feet in any direction. For the next few weeks, I focused on testing and improving the design. I made my own custom board out of maple in the perfect shape and size. Then I designed a base that could convert from a movable footrest to a standing balance board. I worked with a friend who helped me design and 3D print the components. I started taking the new and improved Casper Board to work to test it out, and soon all my co-workers wanted one! Outsite PartnershipWe're thrilled to announce that we have teamed up with Outsite an incredible network of co-working/co-living spaces around the world, to promote active working, no matter what your working style might be.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Active Minds at Saint Joseph's University has been recognized as a student run organization as of November 3rd, 2011 and as a chapter of the National Active Minds organization in late November, 2011. The organization was founded in 2001 by Alison Malmon, then a junior at UPENN, following the suicide of her older brother, Brian, one year earlier.  Brian, also a college student, had been experiencing depression and psychosis for three years but had concealed his symptoms from others around him.  In the middle of his senior year, he returned to his hometown in Maryland and began receiving treatment for schizoaffective disorder.  A year and a half later, as Alison was wrapping up her freshman year at Penn, Brian ended his life.  Alison became motivated to change the culture of mental health issues on campus and wanted to combat the stigma of mental illness, encourage students who needed help to seek it early, and prevent future tragedies like the one that took her brother's life.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is the <span style=""color: #ff0033;"">only</span> organization working to utilize the student voice to change the conversation about mental health on college campuses.  Through campus-wide events and national programs, Active Minds aims to remove the stigma that surrounds mental health issues and create a comfortable environment for an open conversation about mental health issues on campuses throughout North America.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Specifically this year Saint Joseph's is hosting the very powerful <em><strong><span style=""color: #ff0033;"">Send Silence Packing</span></strong></em> exhibit, during which we will display 1,100 donated backpacks representing the <span style=""color: #ff0033;"">1,100 college students</span> whose lives are lost each year to suicide.  The backpacks were donated in honor of loved ones.  Many of them are accompanied by personal stories to help put a ""face"" to the lives lost to suicide.  This program is an interactive, day-long exhibit that opens minds, raises awareness and educates the public about the harsh realities of suicide.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In addition to our event, our guest speaker, Jordan Burnham will share his personal story of a suicide attempt during his senior year of high school and his miraculous survival in order to educate students about depression, suicide, and coping mechanisms for young adults.  He was honored as one of the ""2010 Best of Philly"" for his work with mental health and speaking, and has been telling his story and inspiring others to speak out about mental health throughout the country for over two years.</p>

has been successfully adapted and employed in the many free clinics H2H 
has provided on 4 separate missions to Guatemala so far in which we have
 given free treatment to over 1000 patients in various locations 
including the communities around Lake Atitlan, Antigua, Quiche, and EL

provided training in Reiki and Chinese medicine techniques to the women 
of the Q'anil Women's Center in Quiche, Guatemala. <br/>Our goal of 
connecting with the indigenous wisdom keepers has been met far beyond 
our expectations. We have participated in traditional Mayan ceremonies 
and learned much from the elders on every trip, including attending the 7
 days of the annual Unification Maya Winter Solstice ceremonies at 
sacred sites in the ancient temple / pyramid complex of Tikal.<br/>The 
people of Guatemala have welcomed us warmly on every trip and we have

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">My name is Sue and I began my weight loss journey in June 2008. After a car accident in 2001, I began gaining weight quickly. In 2008, I decided enough was enough and jumped in with both feet to start getting rid of my extra baggage. 3 years have passed and I have lost over 100 lbs! I have dedicated myself to this lifestyle change and I will NEVER go back to where I was. </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">The only thing holding me back from reaching my goal is the large amount of extra skin left on my abdomen. This skin keeps me from being able to run and exercise freely and is extremely uncomfortable.. Clothes that I have worked so hard to fit into, don't fit right because of it. No amount of diet or exercise will free me of this ""scar"". After speaking with numerous plastic surgeons, my only option is to have it removed surgically, but the cost, ofcourse, is not covered by insurance. </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><br/></p>

</div></div>","My Story
My name is Sue and I began my weight loss journey in June 2008. After a car accident in 2001, I began gaining weight quickly. In 2008, I decided enough was enough and jumped in with both feet to start getting rid of my extra baggage. 3 years have passed and I have lost over 100 lbs! I have dedicated myself to this lifestyle change and I will NEVER go back to where I was. 

The only thing holding me back from reaching my goal is the large amount of extra skin left on my abdomen. This skin keeps me from being able to run and exercise freely and is extremely uncomfortable.. Clothes that I have worked so hard to fit into, don't fit right because of it. No amount of diet or exercise will free me of this ""scar"". After speaking with numerous plastic surgeons, my only option is to have it removed surgically, but the cost, ofcourse, is not covered by insurance. 


So that is why I am here. Asking that you help me raise the money needed so I can have this surgery. So I can reach my goal of running a half marathon! To fit into a beautiful wedding dress, to feel comfortable in my new healthy body that I continue to work so hard to get and keep. 

I realize that although this may not be necessary to everyone, it is extremely important to my quality of life.

<p>Founded in 2007, Brooklyn Rugby Club is a community organization that is committed to the growth of rugby union in New York City’s most populous borough.</p>
<p>As you can imagine New York is an extremely expensive and difficult city to establish a sporting club. As a young organization that is fully self-funded with very little sponsorship or alumni, we struggle to keep afloat.<br/></p>
<p>We are a highly successful club, consisting of Men’s and Women’s 15s and 7s teams. The Men finished 4th of 11 teams in D3 and our Women’s team made the D2 playoffs. Last summer, our Men’s 7s came 3rd of 15 teams in the tri-state area, and our Women’s 7s won the Princeton 7s Cup. </p>
<p>We are reaching out for funding because we need some essential training equipment plus help to subsidize our administration and running costs. </p>
<p>This includes tournament and league entry fees, field hire, purchasing equipment (balls, tackle bags, cones, medical kits etc), transportation, player registration, coaching, creating marketing and sponsorship materials for the club. </p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>Fundraising Milestones</h3>
<p>To help people understand the types of things we are looking for financial help with, we have created the following milestones for this fundraising campaign. </p>
<p><b>Milestone 1: $3,000</b><br/><b>Home Jerseys<br/></b>A new set of home jerseys for Brooklyn Rugby Men and Women 15-a-side teams. The ones we have are very outdated and are becoming increasingly unfit for purpose. We need new ones!<br/></p>
<p><b>Milestone 2: $5,000<br/></b>Home and <b>7s Jerseys</b><br/>Brooklyn Rugby has men and women's 7s sides and this venture is creating a lot of successes for the club, not just in actual tournament wins but also in generating publicity and driving player recruitment. We feel strongly that Brooklyn Rugby 7s should have its own unique identity, on a par with the more fun aspect of 7s rugby. Reaching this goal will allow us to pay for a unique set of 7s jerseys for our men and women's teams.</p>
<p><b>Milestone 3: $8,000</b><br/>Home, 7s and<b> Away Jerseys</b><br/>A new set of away jerseys for Brooklyn Rugby Men and Women's 15-a-side teams. The men's away jerseys are in even worse shape than the home ones, and our women's side don't even have them. Reaching this goal will help us fix the jersey problem for our 15-a-side teams.<br/></p>
<p><b>Milestone 4: $12,000<br/></b>All of the above + <b>a new scrum sled!</b><br/>As the old saying goes ""forwards win the game, backs decide by how much"". Well, to prove this, our forwards need this very essential piece of kit for scrum training. A scrum sled is one of the most basic - but expensive - pieces of equipment for a club yet we still don't have one. </p>
<p><b>Milestone 5: $20,000</b></p>
<p>All of the above +<b> portable floodlighting and a generator</b><br/>Getting permits for a field to practice rugby in New York City is incredibly tough. Rugby is a sport that is very low on the priority list for the Department of Parks &amp; Recreation. So, we train where we can, literally on dirt and rock covered soccer pitches in the dark and - when we're lucky - the grassy outfields of a baseball field. Needless to say, practicing rugby in the dark can prove incredibly frustrating and unproductive. We need portable floodlights and a generator to help this situation.</p>

We're all chipping in where we can and http://podcastingforcancer.org/ is coming along nicely. Trevor and Josh recently stepped in on the vSoup podcast to talk a little bit about where the SMB lives in the IT world and naturally, about vPodcasting & Podcasting for Cancer. Give it a listen!
New Perk! ($1000)
vSoup has also kindly offered a few perks of their own. At the $1000 level, you can convince them to talk about anything. Anything! Best hairstyle in IT, favorite flavor of bacon salt, anything your imagination can summon. We do ask that you keep it clean, but if you really want them to talk about adult entertainment websites or their favorite local burlesque establishments who are we to stop you?

<h3>**UPDATE 3/6**  The $2800 goal we set was from the estimate provided by UCLA dental school before she actually had any work done.  Now that Willow has completed the deep cleaning, xrays  and fillings, she has been given a more detailed, accurate estimate, which brings us to $3300 for the actual goal.  So even though the goal shown here has been met, we are going to continue to raise funds until we hit $3300!  So keep sharing the link!  Let's do this!</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My sister-in-law, Willow, was born with 32 teeth in her face.  They were bad, bad teeth.  She grew up hearing horror stories, like the battle of MomTeeth versus BabyRob, where BabyRob dealt a swift blow to MomFace and MomTeeth were killed on impact.  Willow tried to keep her teeth from going down the wrong roads in life.  She read them stories, she gave them uplifting peptalks, she even took them to Disneyland and convinced them that ToonTown was actually called ToothTown and was built solely for the enjoyment of her teeth.  One day, Willow's front tooth, Toothy, succumbed to the pressure.  He just couldn't handle being the only one out of 32 to look... different.  You see, he was cracked.  And finally, he snapped.  Like, in half.  Willow, being under employed, could not afford dental healthcare, so she called every friend, every government agency, and every televised motivational speaker she could find to get poor Toothy fixed, but alas, none could help her.  So she stopped smiling.  Immediately after she stopped smiling the world grew colder.  Winter Storm Nemo came and devastated the East coast.  The pope stepped down.  Seth McFarlane became unfunny at the Oscars.  Willow couldn't handle watching the world collapse, so she contacted the UCLA school of dentistry.  They evaluated her face and informed her that Toothy didn't snap suddenly, oh no, he was planning it.  He staged a revolt of epic proportions.  11 of her teeth had joined his monstrous plan and had to be pulled immediately, lest they release their evil upon the world and bring with it such dental abominations, not even the British could comprehend. </p>
<p>It is important to note that Toothy and his fellow accomplices were born with their propensity for evil, they are <strong>not</strong> a result of drug use.</p>

<p style="""">Sitting is the ultimate passive
activity. When we sit, the electrical activity in our muscles flatlines.
Powering down our body like that for long periods of time leads to a cascade of
negative effects - heart rate, calorie burn, insulin effectiveness, and levels
of good cholesterol all drop. Molecules that play an important role in
processing fats and sugars stop working, and without them, our metabolism
suffers. It’s no wonder that those who sit for long periods of time each day
have larger waistlines and worse blood sugar and blood pressure profiles, and
are at higher risk of heart disease, diabetes, obesity, and cancer, than those
who sit less.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">
</p>Don’t think you’re off the hook
because you get in some vigorous exercise each day … you’re not. Exercise does <em><span>not</span></em> counteract the
negative effects of sitting. It’s like thinking you can snack on chips all
day, and then offset that by running for an hour.<br/><br/><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">It's time to Take a Stand</h3>

The STANZ <em><span>workblade</span></em> posture-correct workstation is
designed for all day comfort and energy, while providing a more productive alternative to prolonged
sitting at work and at home. With this amazing upright station, you’re not
standing all day, you’re ‘stanzing’- you won’t believe the stamina you develop.
Stanz workblades reduce weight on the legs by 10% as they angle the body into a
most relaxed and efficient upright position. You’ll be burning more calories
before you know it and, by being more active, you just might lose extra weight.
All you need is a pair of comfy shoes. <br/><br/>Stanz workblades are the intelligent,
ergonomic way to get all your work done and feel refreshed at the end of the
day. They make prolonged sitting and tiresome standing relics of the past.
Besides, the workblade looks cool and futuristic. Raise your worktable or desk
any way you like and slide in a STANZ. People will start looking up to you.<p style=""text-align: center;"">

killing us.


We’ve become sitting ducks in our chairs.



Become a Chuck that Chair advocate!

We’re spending more time glued to chairs in a sedentary lifestyle. Sitting for hours a day, even on expensive chairs and at well-designed workstations, contribute to problems that just keep getting worse year on year. Back and neck pain, frequent headaches, winding up with more serious health issues, namely obesity and the much publicizedSitting Disease

Sitting is the ultimate passive
activity. When we sit, the electrical activity in our muscles flatlines.
Powering down our body like that for long periods of time leads to a cascade of
negative effects - heart rate, calorie burn, insulin effectiveness, and levels
of good cholesterol all drop. Molecules that play an important role in
processing fats and sugars stop working, and without them, our metabolism
suffers. It’s no wonder that those who sit for long periods of time each day
have larger waistlines and worse blood sugar and blood pressure profiles, and
are at higher risk of heart disease, diabetes, obesity, and cancer, than those
who sit less.

Don’t think you’re off the hook
because you get in some vigorous exercise each day … you’re not. Exercise does not counteract the
negative effects of sitting. It’s like thinking you can snack on chips all
day, and then offset that by running for an hour.It's time to Take a Stand



Switching from chairs to upright workstations reduces
obesity and improves circulation. Standing up for three hours will consume 144
calories. “People are sitting
down at work, then sitting in the car and then sitting down in front of the
television. It isn’t natural. Humans are designed to stand up and keep moving.”  - John Buckley, the University of Chester.In response to a study that warned that a sedentary
lifestyle could be causing as many deaths as smoking, Dr. Buckley says that
regular changes in the workplace can mean long-term improvements. “It’s little
changes in behavior… such as standing at your desk that can add up to quite a
big difference to your health.”


“OK, I know sitting down
is killing me - but if I stand all day, that kills me too.”

Here's how you can help

Introducing the Next Big Idea

The remarkable STANZ workblade

The STANZ workblade posture-correct workstation is
designed for all day comfort and energy, while providing a more productive alternative to prolonged
sitting at work and at home. With this amazing upright station, you’re not
standing all day, you’re ‘stanzing’- you won’t believe the stamina you develop.
Stanz workblades reduce weight on the legs by 10% as they angle the body into a
most relaxed and efficient upright position. You’ll be burning more calories
before you know it and, by being more active, you just might lose extra weight.
All you need is a pair of comfy shoes. Stanz workblades are the intelligent,
ergonomic way to get all your work done and feel refreshed at the end of the
day. They make prolonged sitting and tiresome standing relics of the past.
Besides, the workblade looks cool and futuristic. Raise your worktable or desk
any way you like and slide in a STANZ. People will start looking up to you.


Workstations of the future



Ergostanz
is innovation that promotes ideal human interaction to a given environment.
Drawing on human biology,
psychology, engineering and design, Ergostanz
patent-protected products optimize system performance through wellness of

Developing the workbladeUnder the watchful eye of Voltaire, JC designed and
tested the first prototype of the STANZ workstation over a 2-year period, constantly
streamlining the design features.







Highlights of the workblade
 The STANZ Highrise model is sturdy & lightweight, with a welded aluminum or steel frame, powder coated with choice of colors, strong vinyl adjustable backrest, ideally angled for all day comfort, and crafted by hand into a simple, elegant shape. STANZ products are built to last a lifetime and extend yours accordingly.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I love these shoes! Barefoot B.E.R.B.S. are my own patent-pending design for a barefoot golf shoe, and every golfer needs to try these shoes. My small company needs to grow, and for that I need to raise funds for a 30-second commercial to run during one of the 2014 Major golf tournaments on NBC or The Golf Channel. In return, contributors will receive a pair of Barefoot B.E.R.B.S., a hat, or a pair of special edition golf shoes.</p>
<p>My name is Jeremy Berbert, a professional golfer on the cusp of success with big aspirations. I love the game of golf, but I found that my feet, knees, hips, and back would start to ache half-way through a round. So one day it occurred to me that no one had yet designed a barefoot style golf shoe.</p>
<p>Being barefoot is the best thing for the human body. Our bodies were not meant to wear shoes with thick, padded heels, especially while golfing. Invented in 2012, Barefoot B.E.R.B.S. is the first golf shoe of its kind. With these shoes, I regularly play 18 holes of pain-free golf without worrying about taking my shoes off for the 19th hole.</p>
<p>I want to let everyone know that there is a better golf shoe out there! One that will help every golfer play better. Practicing barefoot is endorsed by Sean Foley, Tiger Woods's swing coach, and now every golfer can play barefoot golf with Barefoot B.E.R.B.S. This campaign will help introduce Barefoot B.E.R.B.S. to the golfing world, assist us in getting launched in retail locations around the country, and educate golfers about the benefits of barefoot golfing.</p>

Hi! We, Berenice, Christina, Greg, and Alexa are Social Work students at the University of Houston - Downtown who are here raise funds to aid others in financial need.
We have personally dealt with or know someone close to us who chose to use at home remedies to get well, and sometimes that does not work. This is where we kick in for our community.
We, as a community, are in a great need for outside supporters to aid Progressive Medicine Associates Clinic serving Houston, which is the clinic that we chose for this campaign . They provide non-urgent medical visits for 40 dollars, but because many individuals are unable to afford even that we'd like your help providing services for those in need.
Please, think about how you would feel going to school, work, caring for your children when in need of a prescription. What is scary is that infections can get worse if not treated. Everyone needs a leg up now and then!What We Need & What You GetBreak it down for folks in more detail:
We would like to raise at minimum 500$ to support free clinic visits that will be going to Progressive Medicine Associates on 8811 Westheimer Rd., 77063. We trust this clinic, especially since, I, Christina have personally been there to get well.
When you donate, no matter how much of an amount, you fund someone to get well!
Even if we do not reach our goal, funds will be given to Progressive Medicine Associates to help cover some patients who are in need. Please remember that clinic visits are 40$ per person....
Other Information!The clinic that we are funding and backing is Progressive Medicine Associates located on 8811 Westheimer rd in Houston, Texas 77063, Suite 101.
You can email them at info@progressiveclinic.com or call 713-978-6337 if you have any questions about their clinic.
You can also visit their website at http://www.progressiveclinic.com

You may also contact me personally about funding questions or concerns at Kelleyc@uhd.edu or Kelleyc07@yahoo.com. Responses are usually quick!
We are senior and junior students at the University of Houston- Downtown giving back to our community as a final project.

Her knees have zero cartilage left and she is unable to walk at all. The Endless pool would provide much needed water therapy, without the social stigma and awkwardness of being overweight and disabled at a public pool.<br/><br/><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><ul>
<li>Endless Pools are unique ""small"" pools that can be installed indoor or outdoor, require very little maintenance, and include a ""swimming machine"" to swim against a current. Some models also include a treadmill, making water walking fun and easy.</li>
<li>While we don't have much in the way of rewards at this time, I'll be looking into options. If you have any ideas or requests, please feel free to reach out!</li>
<li>If we do not fully reach our goal, the funds will be kept in an account for mom's medical care, while she saves up money to put toward the pool. Even a small amount will be helpful because it will reduce the amount of money mom has to save up on a limited income.</li>
</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p></p>My mom worked hard her whole life to provide for her family. She spent over 15 years in a job that was hard on her, both physically and emotionally, just to put food on the table and keep a roof over our heads.<br/><br/>In 2007, my Dad, mom's life partner and soul mate, passed away. She has struggled for years with chronic pain and disability. Since losing her husband, she has gained more weight and become even less mobile than before. <p></p><div>
<br/>Mom's income also took a drastic hit when we lost Dad -- most of their income was from his retirement and disability. Mom is surviving on a small fixed income and is unable to fund a project like this on her own.<br/><br/>If Dad were still alive, the VA would have been able to help have a pool installed. Unfortunately, it was a struggle just to get the accessible features in their home finished, as the VA-financed remodel was incomplete when he passed away. <br/><br/>Mom was recently diagnosed with stage 3 kidney disease, and her doctor said the only way for her to improve her kidney health is to lose some weight. Because of her knees, water therapy is the only means of exercise she has. </div><div>
<br/><p></p>
<p>As you might imagine, there is a lot of anxiety as an overweight, disabled woman exercising in public, especially in a bathing suit.  Mom and I did take an aquacise class, but it became difficult dealing with the looks and whispers we would get while she was being lifted into the pool.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>If Mom is able to exercise in the pool, she will be able to lose the weight needed to be eligible for a knee replacement so that she can walk again, and hopefully reverse or prevent further damage to her kidneys.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>In short -- my Mom is the kindest and most amazing woman I know, and she deserves to have this dream come true. With this pool she will be able to exercise daily, in the comfort of her own home. As an added bonus, the rest of our family will have access to the health benefits of aqua therapy as well. (I myself am also overweight, and you can bet I will be at mom's pool as often as I can be!)<br/></p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><a href=""http://www.healthyfeetclinic.ca/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Healthy Feet Clinic</a> is committed to providing our customers with the highest quality of products and services for healthy feet and legs. Our compression socks are designed to help improve health. Our services are delivered by trained and certified staff backed by a group of medical professionals.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Your feet and legs are your body's foundation. They provide you with the ability to move freely and enjoy your independence.</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: justify;""><strong><span style=""color: #ff0000;"">What happens when that mobility is no longer possible?</span></strong></h2>
<h2 style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Here’s a real life example</strong></h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Dale, on our team, watched his elderly father lose his independence because he could no longer walk. Once that occurred, the quality of his father's life changed, his ability to move freely was curtailed, and his interest in life was lessened.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This had a direct effect on his father, his family and the medical system that cared for him.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This is one of the main reasons for this campaign.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Joe, also on our team, experienced on many occasions people coming to him at ""Healthy Leg Days"" (and at our clinic) who badly need compression socks, and who -- even if he offered them socks at cost -- could not afford them.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Sadly, this has occurred on too many occasions.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Another reason why this program is important.</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Who should wear compression socks?</strong></h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Pilots ~ Teachers ~ Seniors ~ Hospitality ~ Nurses ~ Bank Tellers ~ Retailers ~ Students ~ and more!</p>
<ul style=""text-align: justify;"">

<li>Do you travel long distances?</li>
</ul>
<h2 style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Why compression socks?</strong></h2>
<ul style=""text-align: justify;"">
<li>Alleviate tired aching legs, swollen feet, ankles and legs.</li>
<li>Promote good blood flow from legs back to the heart.</li>
<li>Prevent pooling and back flow of blood which causes aching legs, feet and may lead to other serious venous conditions (varicose veins, blood clots).</li>
</ul>
<h2 style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>How do compression socks work?</strong></h2>
<ul style=""text-align: justify;"">
<li>Veins in a person's legs carry blood back to the heart.</li>
<li>The calf muscle, when walking, aids as a pump to push blood through the veins up to the heart.</li>
<li>Because blood is working against gravity the veins house one-way valves which open &amp; close when the heart pumps, thereby ensuring blood does not flow back down the leg.</li>
<li>When a person sits or stands for long periods of time the calf muscle is not contracting and relaxing, resulting in blood pooling on the valves and pushing on walls of the veins.</li>

This had a direct effect on his father, his family and the medical system that cared for him.

Joe, also on our team, experienced on many occasions people coming to him at ""Healthy Leg Days"" (and at our clinic) who badly need compression socks, and who -- even if he offered them socks at cost -- could not afford them.
Sadly, this has occurred on too many occasions.
Another reason why this program is important.
Who should wear compression socks?
Pilots ~ Teachers ~ Seniors ~ Hospitality ~ Nurses ~ Bank Tellers ~ Retailers ~ Students ~ and more!

Do you sit or stand for long periods of time?
Do you have swollen/tired/heavy ankles, feet and legs?
Are you prone to varicose or spider veins?

Why compression socks?

Alleviate tired aching legs, swollen feet, ankles and legs.
Promote good blood flow from legs back to the heart.
Prevent pooling and back flow of blood which causes aching legs, feet and may lead to other serious venous conditions (varicose veins, blood clots).

How do compression socks work?

<p>Today in America, there is a huge GAP between what people want for End-of-Life care and what they actually receive. This is a humanitarian crisis of massive proportions:</p>
<p><strong>90% of people would prefer to die at home</strong> surrounded by the things they love and the people who love them…   <strong>But in reality…</strong><br/><br/><strong>80% of people die in hospitals or nursing homes</strong>, where they may be attached to machines, hoses, tubes, and surrounded by strangers… a terrible way to die. <br/><br/>Why are millions of Americans suffering needlessly and not dying in the manner they desire? Why are families asked to make uninformed medical decisions resulting in great emotional pain and turmoil? And finally, why are billions of dollars being spent by families, companies and the government on medical interventions that the dying person would never have wanted? <br/><br/>This is all occurring because no one talks about death and dying: the right questions have not been asked and the right documents have not been signed. We plan to educate and activate others by stimulating a discussion on these issues with the goal of shifting the paradigm of how Americans approach the End of Life.<br/><br/>Excerpt adapted from It’s OK to Die by Dr. Monica Williams-Murphy ....<br/><em>...The paramedic radioed in to the ER “we are bringing you a 70 year-old female patient who has had multiple strokes, is paralyzed and has been in a Nursing home for 10 years. Tonight she has respiratory distress… oxygen and blood pressure are both low.” When they arrived my first glance told me she was dying. “Does she have a DNR (Do Not Resuscitate) order?” I asked as I listened to the fluid filling her failing lungs. “No she is Full Code” came the reply. “Full Code?” I ask as I felt her stiff retracted arm, and body frozen in the fetal position from years of disuse. I felt paralyzed myself, because “Full Code” means they are asking me to shove a breathing tube down her throat and stick a long needle under her collar bone, and shock her if her heart gives out. This seemed wrong. Would she even want more years of living like this?

<h2>Why Does This End-of-Life Crisis Exist?</h2>
<p>We hope you are now asking, “Why does this happen? How can this be allowed? How can 80% of Americans die in places they do not want to be?” Dr. Williams-Murphy has identified key cultural beliefs and practices that explain how this crisis developed and the effects they have had on the American experience of death and dying.</p>

<h2><strong><strong><span>Project: </span></strong></strong></h2>
<h2><strong><strong><span>Eliminating End-of-Life Suffering for Loved Ones</span></strong></strong></h2>
<p>The “It’s OK to Die” organization reaches out to the terminally ill and frail elderly, their families, and their caregivers to inform, educate and guide them in preparing the necessary steps (emotional, financial and medical) so that no American will face the end of their life without their wishes, and directions for THEIR OWN health care being known and carried out. Entering the End-of-Life without such plans can create a perilous time of needless suffering and confusion for everyone, in addition to exacting enormous emotional and financial costs. </p>
<p>We also educate doctors, caregivers and End-of-Life facilities serving terminally ill or the elderly on the natural process of dying, and outline how to create positive End-of-Life experiences - physical, emotional, social and even financial. <br/><br/>The “It’s Ok to Die” organization openly addresses the culturally sensitive subject of death and dying and teaches how to manage care at the end of life to create a “good death.” We plan to use our book (which details the problems and solutions in America today), training tools, and media outlets to educate all the caregivers and patients we can.</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>Solution: Education and Action</h2>
<p>We seek to raise the awareness of ALL Americans about the pressing need to make your peace, make your plans and make them known. We will inform, educate and assist everyone we can in managing the one single event that effects 100% of ALL of us....dying.</p>
<p>There are 10,000 people turning 65 every day in America; 10,000 people closer to the time when they or a family loved one will have to make tough choices about their own End of Life. But all of them can plan to make this period of life a good one for both themselves and their family.</p>
<p>As the book details – <strong>Yes, you can plan a “Good Death.”</strong> How? By educating all those involved with the process and utilizing Dr. Williams-Murphy’s simple solutions – specifically by:<strong><strong><br/></strong></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span>De-mystifying death and dying as a topic of social conversation. This allows people to discuss and create End-of-Life plans without feeling fearful, inappropriate or morbid.</span></li>
<li><span>Creating death and dying education for and by doctors. This will allow doctors to honestly educate patients about their own mortality and to better help them choose medical interventions that maximize quality time at the End-of-Life.</span></li>
<li>
<span>Providing free End-of-Life decision tools to both families and medical professionals (co-created by Dr. Williams-Murphy) including; 1)</span><span> Personal Self-Assessment Scale (PSAS) -</span><span> helps families make future decisions about what medical care you want and when you want it, and 2) </span><span>Fierro’s Four R’s</span><span> decision tool -  helps you make decisions for loved ones who have lost the ability to make medical decisions for themselves. </span>
</li>
<li><span>Helping you to identify when and how to shift from “cure-focused” to “comfort-focused” medicine near the End of Life. When this goal changes, it changes almost all of the actions taken by you, your family, your caregivers and your doctors.</span></li>
<li><span>Finding ways to harness the power and gifts inherent to the End of Life that are limited at other times of living including: Heightened emotional availability, Relationship healing opportunities, Forgiveness, Closure, Healing and Release (“Six Things That Must Be Said”), Summarizing life lessons, and Leaving a legacy. </span></li>
</ul><p><strong><strong><br/></strong></strong>All of this moves us closer to creating a “good death” at home, if possible, in the arms of those who love us most. We move from selecting Artificial Life support to choosing Natural Death support (hospice and palliative care services). Here is a true story about someone who used our book as a guide in managing his own End-of-Life choices: <br/><br/><em>“Recently, an 88 year-old acquaintance of ours found himself in the hospital, with failing kidneys and lungs. The doctors had placed him on dialysis and he was confined to a hospital room on oxygen, connected to monitors and with multiple IVs. Apparently, he had expressed to many family members, “This is not what I want.” But neither he nor his family members knew how to ask for or create any alternatives; nor had any doctors discussed changing treatment goals or asked him what he really wanted for himself. A visitor had brought his eldest son a copy of our book, “It’s OK to Die,” and explained to the son that the book would bring clarity to the situation and help them to make choices that could bring peace to the whole family. According to reports, the elderly gentleman saw his son reading this book and asked to look at it himself. He read it through and then called his doctors in for a conference. He said, “Take all of these tubes out of me, I’m going home. I want a hospice called in.” Next, he gently explained to his family why he made this choice and how he wanted to die in his own home. They agreed to honor his decisions. Once home, his family fed him his favorite meals. His extended family and friends came to his home say their “thank you’s, I love you’s, and good-byes.” Children sat in his lap. He died one week later, in his favorite chair, wrapped in his favorite blanket, in his sleep, with his family at his side. This is how most Americans want to die” - Dr. Monica Williams-Murphy</em></p>

<h2><strong><strong><span>What we want to accomplish and how you can help!</span><br/></strong></strong></h2>
<p><strong><strong><br/></strong></strong>The “It’s OK to Die” organization has 3 main measurable goals for this project.  We call these “The Three R’s”:</p>
<ul>
<li>REDUCE Patient suffering at the End of Life.</li>
<li>REDUCE Family suffering at the end of the life of a loved one.</li>
<li>REDUCE Spending by families, organizations and government on unnecessary and unwanted, and often futile medical interventions</li>
</ul><p>Our overarching project goal is to change the End-of-Life paradigm which, presently, is causing needless suffering for millions of elderly and terminally ill Americans, as well as wasting billions of dollars for families and taxpayers.</p>
<p>First and foremost, The ""It’s OK to Die"" authors want to educate people about their options and help them to create an action plan in order to reduce pain and suffering for themselves and their families. However, a secondary and huge benefit of this information/education will be that End-of-Life care costs will be cut dramatically - for families, providers, insurance and government. Cutting spending on healthcare is not a primary reason for this effort, but it is the natural result of patients being able to control what is done to them (or not) at the end of their lives. <br/><br/>How will we do this? We hope to share the simplified knowledge of End-of-Life care processes and decision matrices developed by Dr. Williams-Murphy, with individuals and organizations who are contemplating, facing, or directly involved in End-of-Life decisions:<strong><strong><br/></strong></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span>People currently living with a terminal illness, or who are elderly or infirm </span></li>
<li><span>Families with loved ones who have a terminal illness, or who are elderly or infirm</span></li>
<li><span>Doctors and other caregivers who deal with patients who have a terminal illness, or who are elderly or infirm </span></li>
<li><span>Institutions that render services to the elderly and infirm </span></li>
</ul><p><strong><strong><span>So, how will your Pledge be spent?</span><span> The “It’s OK to Die” organization will spearhead and invest toward End-of-Life education in America by:</span><br/></strong></strong></p>

Today in America, there is a huge GAP between what people want for End-of-Life care and what they actually receive. This is a humanitarian crisis of massive proportions:
90% of people would prefer to die at home surrounded by the things they love and the people who love them…   But in reality…80% of people die in hospitals or nursing homes, where they may be attached to machines, hoses, tubes, and surrounded by strangers… a terrible way to die. Why are millions of Americans suffering needlessly and not dying in the manner they desire? Why are families asked to make uninformed medical decisions resulting in great emotional pain and turmoil? And finally, why are billions of dollars being spent by families, companies and the government on medical interventions that the dying person would never have wanted? This is all occurring because no one talks about death and dying: the right questions have not been asked and the right documents have not been signed. We plan to educate and activate others by stimulating a discussion on these issues with the goal of shifting the paradigm of how Americans approach the End of Life.Excerpt adapted from It’s OK to Die by Dr. Monica Williams-Murphy .......The paramedic radioed in to the ER “we are bringing you a 70 year-old female patient who has had multiple strokes, is paralyzed and has been in a Nursing home for 10 years. Tonight she has respiratory distress… oxygen and blood pressure are both low.” When they arrived my first glance told me she was dying. “Does she have a DNR (Do Not Resuscitate) order?” I asked as I listened to the fluid filling her failing lungs. “No she is Full Code” came the reply. “Full Code?” I ask as I felt her stiff retracted arm, and body frozen in the fetal position from years of disuse. I felt paralyzed myself, because “Full Code” means they are asking me to shove a breathing tube down her throat and stick a long needle under her collar bone, and shock her if her heart gives out. This seemed wrong. Would she even want more years of living like this? Being rolled over every two hours to ease bed sores, probably not even knowing who is in the room, unable to speak or hear? The family arrived and I told them, “We are in a critical window, but there are options. “ I explained Full Code, a Middle Ground, or Comfort Care –“providing oxygen and medicines to keep her pain free and restful, and you can stay beside her.” “We want you to do everything you can Doctor” was the reply, a request for the Full Code pathway. In the ICU the next day, long after visiting hours were over, my patient died…alone. Like this…
Would she have even wanted this for herself? Was she ever asked? We want to eliminate this type of needless suffering for Americans who are very elderly or who have advanced terminal illness. We can teach people what they need to know and do, to avoid this kind of situation, for themselves and their love ones. We want to teach individuals, and the Nation, how to plan for and manage their own End-of-Life care.
Please understand that we do not support euthanasia/assisted suicide, rather our intention is to educate others on how to be in control of the End-of-LIfe process, and to transform it into a time of comfort, peace and closure for all.
 
Why Does This End-of-Life Crisis Exist?
We hope you are now asking, “Why does this happen? How can this be allowed? How can 80% of Americans die in places they do not want to be?” Dr. Williams-Murphy has identified key cultural beliefs and practices that explain how this crisis developed and the effects they have had on the American experience of death and dying.
 

Death is no longer viewed as a natural part of life. It is now viewed as a medical event that must be managed in institutions (nursing homes, hospitals...).
Since most people now die in medical institutions, we have lost cultural knowledge of how death happens naturally and what it looks like. 
No one talks about death in social dialogue and therefore, no plans are made for the End-of-Life.
Most doctors have developed an attitude that losing a patient is a defeat and thus tend to avoid conversations about death and dying as well.
Modern living (commuting, moving, computers) has changed the way we relate to each other, creating emotional distance possibly leading us to select more aggressive medical intervention to keep “mother” alive long enough for us to create closure for ourselves.
Modern medicine seems to provide technological “miracles.” 
 All this gives the false impression that we can control or prevent death. We cannot, we can only sometimes delay it... and often with horrendous suffering and burdens:


Physical: Breathing tubes, feeding tubes, bedsores, IV lines, infections.


Emotional: The patient feels like he or she has become a burden on others, and the family is emotionally exhausted and overwhelmed with complicated medical choices and the work of caring for their loved one.


Providers: Suffer a huge guilt burden about whether or not they are making the right decision for their loved one.


Negative Financial Impacts: to the family and taxpayers for unnecessary, unwanted and futile medical procedures.

The bottom line is that ""It’s OK to Die"" will help move our thought processes from High-Tech to High-Touch medical choices at the End of Life.

So, how will your Pledge be spent? The “It’s OK to Die” organization will spearhead and invest toward End-of-Life education in America by:

Providing the book, “It’s OK to Die,” to individuals, hospitals, religious organizations, assisted care facilities/providers, and hospice providers.
Set-up and provide training/seminars not only for medical professionals, but also for individuals and groups who want to proactively manage the End-of-Life process. 
Distribute copies of the book to elected representatives and their staff within relevant departments, throughout the United States including Medicare/Medicaid, Congress and state level officials. 
Use multiple media outlets (social media, Internet, traditional outlets…) as funds permit, to reach as many people as possible… to let them know there are answers and that they can take control and determine their own path.

<p>So many of us admire her strength of character and her giving spirit, that we would like to give back to her, a way to help her reach her goals. Completing a 5K is much harder with a regular wheelchair, as are the turns and twists you may want to do in a Zumba class. A sports wheelchair would be much better to exercise in!</p>
<p>The Wheelchair is an Invacare TopEnd Pro-2 All-Sport Wheelchair. Detailed product information can be found here: <a href=""http://www.topendwheelchair.com/OurChairs/Product-Details.aspx?id=35"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.topendwheelchair.com/OurChairs/Product-Details.aspx?id=35</a></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<h3></h3>
<p>We need $2700.00 to purchase the wheelchair and possibly some accessories</p>
<p>If you donate $20 or more and wish to, your name will appear on the card we present Terry when she receives this gift. If you give a gift of $100 or greater, you can write a personal note of encouragement to be given. You are also welcome to remain anonymous!</p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal, we will still take all the funds raised to go as a first deposit to purchasing one.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3> <p>It's not every day that there is a clear opportunity, a way to help someone who means so much.

She has begun taking Zumba classes and training for 5K's to stay fit, despite her physical limitations.
So many of us admire her strength of character and her giving spirit, that we would like to give back to her, a way to help her reach her goals. Completing a 5K is much harder with a regular wheelchair, as are the turns and twists you may want to do in a Zumba class. A sports wheelchair would be much better to exercise in!
The Wheelchair is an Invacare TopEnd Pro-2 All-Sport Wheelchair. Detailed product information can be found here: http://www.topendwheelchair.com/OurChairs/Product-Details.aspx?id=35   What We Need & What You Get

We need $2700.00 to purchase the wheelchair and possibly some accessories
If you donate $20 or more and wish to, your name will appear on the card we present Terry when she receives this gift. If you give a gift of $100 or greater, you can write a personal note of encouragement to be given. You are also welcome to remain anonymous!
If we don't reach our goal, we will still take all the funds raised to go as a first deposit to purchasing one.
The Impact It's not every day that there is a clear opportunity, a way to help someone who means so much. A new chair is a small token to show a well-deserving friend how much we care and how much we are rooting for her to challenge herself to new goals and heights. The Invacare Top End Pro 2 Sports Chair has a 5K race attachment that we allow much greater ease and smoothness when traveling long distances.
  Risks & Challenges  Our Plan is to surprise Terry with this campaign so we hope that there is a great turnout of support to this challenge so she can see the difference her humble and giving spirit has had on others.   Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help:  Help us get the word out and make some noise about this campaign. Use the Indiegogo share tools!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p style=""font-family: sans-serif;font-size: 16px;line-height: 20px;color: #444;"">Unlike other wellness trackers, Beddit doesn’t require you to wear anything. You just place the ultra-thin Beddit sensor under your bed sheet and sleep on it.</p>
<p style=""font-family: sans-serif;font-size: 16px;line-height: 20px;color: #444;"">In the morning, you get a full report of your sleep quality, heart rate, breathing rhythm, movement, sleep stages, snoring, and the sleeping environment; noise level and light. You get also personalized coaching tips and guidance based on your results how you can improve your sleep and wellness.</p>

Because of our passive method, your sleep is natural and undisturbed. Therefore, the results of how you sleep will be more accurate.</p>
<p style=""font-family: sans-serif;font-size: 16px;line-height: 20px;color: #444;"">We need your help to finalize the design, order the first production batch of sensors and to complete the mobile application. We have developed this product for over two years together with leading sleep experts and we have almost ten years of experience in ballistocardiography (BCG), the underlying scientific method.</p>
<p style=""font-family: sans-serif;font-size: 16px;line-height: 20px;color: #444;"">We have had the Beddit Pro sleep tracker for professional use on the market over 18 months. Now, we want to make this available for everyone at a reasonable price with a captivating and useful app by introducing the new Beddit for your wellness.</p>
<p style=""font-family: sans-serif;font-size: 16px;line-height: 20px;color: #444;"">Sleep is an essential part of our lives and one of the key factors in our wellbeing. We spend almost a third of our lives in bed. Approximately half of us experience some sort of sleep disorder. Some don't even notice that their exhaustion is originating from poor sleep. </p>
<p style=""font-family: sans-serif;font-size: 16px;line-height: 20px;color: #444;"">We want to give you insight on how you sleep so that you can improve your sleep and improve your overall performance and quality of life.</p>

<p style=""font-family: sans-serif;font-size: 16px;line-height: 20px;color: #444;"">Beddit is essentially a convenient sleep and wellness tracker working as a life-style and stress management tool. You can track your sleep, wellness and stress levels and get coaching on how to overcome any issues. Sleep is the third key element of your wellbeing, in addition to nutrition and exercise. Beddit is not a medical device, but with Beddit, you can manage your sleep.</p>
<p style=""font-family: sans-serif;font-size: 16px;line-height: 20px;color: #444;""><img alt=""Beddit Feature Diagram"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.beddit.com/static/img/results.png"" src="""" style=""width: 100%;"" title=""Beddit Feature Diagram""/></p>
<p style=""font-family: sans-serif;font-size: 16px;line-height: 20px;color: #444;"">It is important for everyone to manage stress no matter if it is originating from exercise, work or from the environment.  By understanding the quality of your sleep, one can take steps to improve sleep which helps to reduce levels of stress in our daily lives.</p>
<p style=""font-family: sans-serif;font-size: 16px;line-height: 20px;color: #444;"">Managing sleep is especially important for athletes.  Sleep equals recovery; athletes need to sleep to improve performance and to avoid overtraining. Sleep is also the most important factor when trying to lose weight and helps improve your skin and hair.</p>

<p style=""font-family: sans-serif;font-size: 16px;line-height: 20px;color: #444;"">You place the Beddit ultra-thin film sensor on your mattress. The sensor film has adhesive on one side. Remove the cover paper and attach the sensor like a sticker to your mattress under the bed sheet or mattress cover. The sensor is plugged into a regular low voltage USB power supply provided with the sensor, so there is no need to change or charge any batteries.</p>
<p style=""font-family: sans-serif;font-size: 16px;line-height: 20px;color: #444;"">After this easy setup, you just sleep. The sensor is fully passive and it does not emit an electromagnetical field or radiation etc. It is totally safe to sleep on and it is not directly touching your body. The sensor measures your presence in the bed (sleep rhythm) and your movements (actigraphy) during the night and also the movements of your heart (heart rate) and your breathing movements (breathing rhythm and snoring).</p>

<p style=""font-family: sans-serif;font-size: 16px;line-height: 20px;color: #444;"">The sensor forwards the measurement information automatically to your mobile device over Bluetooth and the information is analyzed in the Beddit app. Beddit app also uses the light and noise sensors of your mobile device and adds these parameters into the analysis of your sleep, wellness and sleeping environment.</p>

<p style=""font-family: sans-serif;font-size: 16px;line-height: 20px;color: #444;"">The results and any nightly events are shown on a timeline with a summary and a sleep score based on your sleep quality. You can look at the sleep score break down to see the different stages of your sleep and wellness results. You also get personalized coaching tips and guidance on how to improve your sleep, performance and wellness. You can also view your sleep history with trends and compare these with provided recommendations.</p>

<p style=""font-family: sans-serif;font-size: 16px;line-height: 20px;color: #444;"">In addition, Beddit has an integrated smart alarm clock that wakes you up in the desired time window, when you sleep lightly. This enables you to wake up refreshed, instead of feeling drowsy. You can also set the alarm to wake you when you have had enough restorative sleep and recovery if you don't need to wake up at certain time. </p>

Unlike other wellness trackers, Beddit doesn’t require you to wear anything. You just place the ultra-thin Beddit sensor under your bed sheet and sleep on it.
In the morning, you get a full report of your sleep quality, heart rate, breathing rhythm, movement, sleep stages, snoring, and the sleeping environment; noise level and light. You get also personalized coaching tips and guidance based on your results how you can improve your sleep and wellness.


Because of our passive method, your sleep is natural and undisturbed. Therefore, the results of how you sleep will be more accurate.
We need your help to finalize the design, order the first production batch of sensors and to complete the mobile application. We have developed this product for over two years together with leading sleep experts and we have almost ten years of experience in ballistocardiography (BCG), the underlying scientific method.
We have had the Beddit Pro sleep tracker for professional use on the market over 18 months. Now, we want to make this available for everyone at a reasonable price with a captivating and useful app by introducing the new Beddit for your wellness.
Sleep is an essential part of our lives and one of the key factors in our wellbeing. We spend almost a third of our lives in bed. Approximately half of us experience some sort of sleep disorder. Some don't even notice that their exhaustion is originating from poor sleep. 
We want to give you insight on how you sleep so that you can improve your sleep and improve your overall performance and quality of life.

How Beddit can help you

Beddit is essentially a convenient sleep and wellness tracker working as a life-style and stress management tool. You can track your sleep, wellness and stress levels and get coaching on how to overcome any issues. Sleep is the third key element of your wellbeing, in addition to nutrition and exercise. Beddit is not a medical device, but with Beddit, you can manage your sleep.

It is important for everyone to manage stress no matter if it is originating from exercise, work or from the environment.  By understanding the quality of your sleep, one can take steps to improve sleep which helps to reduce levels of stress in our daily lives.
Managing sleep is especially important for athletes.  Sleep equals recovery; athletes need to sleep to improve performance and to avoid overtraining. Sleep is also the most important factor when trying to lose weight and helps improve your skin and hair.

How to install

You place the Beddit ultra-thin film sensor on your mattress. The sensor film has adhesive on one side. Remove the cover paper and attach the sensor like a sticker to your mattress under the bed sheet or mattress cover. The sensor is plugged into a regular low voltage USB power supply provided with the sensor, so there is no need to change or charge any batteries.
After this easy setup, you just sleep. The sensor is fully passive and it does not emit an electromagnetical field or radiation etc. It is totally safe to sleep on and it is not directly touching your body. The sensor measures your presence in the bed (sleep rhythm) and your movements (actigraphy) during the night and also the movements of your heart (heart rate) and your breathing movements (breathing rhythm and snoring).









The data
The sensor forwards the measurement information automatically to your mobile device over Bluetooth and the information is analyzed in the Beddit app. Beddit app also uses the light and noise sensors of your mobile device and adds these parameters into the analysis of your sleep, wellness and sleeping environment.

The results and any nightly events are shown on a timeline with a summary and a sleep score based on your sleep quality. You can look at the sleep score break down to see the different stages of your sleep and wellness results. You also get personalized coaching tips and guidance on how to improve your sleep, performance and wellness. You can also view your sleep history with trends and compare these with provided recommendations.

In addition, Beddit has an integrated smart alarm clock that wakes you up in the desired time window, when you sleep lightly. This enables you to wake up refreshed, instead of feeling drowsy. You can also set the alarm to wake you when you have had enough restorative sleep and recovery if you don't need to wake up at certain time. 
Science behind Beddit

Beddit is based on ballistocardiography (BCG), a scientific method for measuring cardiorespiratory functions.
It detects the tiny movements caused by your respiration and heartbeat, and converts the data into useful sleep and wellness information and guidance.

Why we need your support

We need your help to finalize the design, order the first production batch of the sensors and to complete the mobile application.
We already have first prototypes of the device ready, and first test users are using them with a limited version of the app. The money will be used to finalize production tools, order components for the first production batch, and further development and testing of the app for both iOS and Android platforms.

We are also doing scientific work to develop the measurement methods and algorithms. The work will produce publications including one doctoral thesis.

Challenges
The risks with the hardware, Beddit sensor, are well mitigated and we have experience in successfully bringing products to the market, as well as managing the supply chain, production, and logistics. The iOS and the Android apps are scheduled to be launched simultaneously. The app development is progressing as planned. First application prototypes with limited features are already being used by the first test users. The hardware works seamlessly with both platforms.
We promise timely and transparent communication throughout the process!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Little Ethan Robinson was born April 16th 2012 with a rare condition that required several surgeries to repair/attach his esophagus and do a colostomy a few days after birth. Some syndrome that i cannot pronounce but has this little guy down again. He is now as of this picture (8 months later) in Texas Childrens (Pedi ICU) Hospital with a double bacterial infection in an area of his body between the lungs and his chest cavity where infections are not supposed to happen. His parents are holding on to their world with their other child and trying to keep it all together. I know I've been there with my now 17 year old son and having an older son at the time/ still only 4-5yrs old; it's incredible hard on everyone. The hospital stays are long and the answers are short, but you hold on for hope and prayers that everything will be as god intended for your family.</p>
<p>I am posting this without the parents knowledge as they are good friends to our family and I do not know at this time that pride would not get in the way of us trying to help them via this channel.</p>
<p>To all those that contribute. God Bless! Remember; no one should feel they have to give or contribute anymore than what they feel they can. Only a dollar will help with bills and prayers will do the rest.</p>

<p>Hi everyone, my name is Ron and I need help paying $10,000 worth of bills I encountered while helping my mother as her caregiver over the past four years.

Please Help.<br/>This funding campaign is not only about me paying bills, its only the beginning for my promise to continue helping seniors citizens. <br/>For those who aren’t familiar with caregiver work - it’s helping people who can’t help themselves. For the past four years, I took care of my bedridden mother, not only as caregiver, but as a certified nursing assistant (CNA). I was never certified because I worked for free.<br/>Somebody had to do the work, but I was the only one willing to do the work. Seven days a week 24 hours a day. I believe that’s what family is all about. Medicare only provided us with a CNA three times a week and an RN once a month. The rest was up to me.<br/>The fundraiser is not just about family, it’s about all of us taking care of each other. it’s true I took care of my mother for 4 years. She just turned ninety and now resides in a nursing home. It took from April 15, 2011 to June of 2012 to get her approved for Medicaid, and now over $4,000 in legal fees. When I said this campaign is about taking care of each other, its because I also am a Senior, I’m 62. After years of visiting my parents in nursing homes, I observed that there were many long term care patients who are only in their 50’s &amp; 60’s, mostly stroke and heart attack patients. So what’s all this about? It’ll make sense shortly. After spending so many years with seniors, I had to be reminded of something I witnessed as a young boy. While attending a St Louis Cardinal baseball game, I saw a pitcher pitch who’s name was Satchel Paige. Now Satchel was believed to be in his 60’s. Way too old to be a baseball player. You see Satchel didn’t have a birth certificate. During an interview, after a game, he was teased about being too old and not knowing his own age. Satchel snapped back, “if you live long enough, you’ll get old too.” <br/>Now Satchel made this statement over fifty years ago. I’m not sure if Satchel or other people realized what a profound statement he made. I’m amazed I still remember it.!! But all I can say is it’s probably from all my time working with seniors and getting older myself. It all came together and now makes a lot of sense. After a great amount of time thinking about Satchels’ statement, it occurred to me that this applies to all of us. Me, you and everybody. If we live long enough we’ll get old too. Then what happens to us? This is why I say Seniors - The Forgotten People..<br/>Now unlike other countries who respect and care for their elderly, we seem to forget about them - we put them in nursing homes. I’ve seen horrible things in nursing homes. Some things so horrible, I’ve seen animals treated better in animal shelters. Do you think it’s time we do something about this? Well, I do. I think we all need to think about what Satchel said. We all will realize that this applies to all of us. Now I’m not trying to say that we need to slow down on taking care of our young.

I am from the Lac Tumba region which is nestled in the heart of the DR of Congo. When I was eleven I dreamt that one day I would leave my tribe and travel to an unfamiliar place that would provide the opportunity to help my people.  This dream landed me in Durham North Carolina.My destiny unfolded when I returned to DR of
Congo after 27 years. Upon arrival, I was immediately struck with shock by the devastating reality my people were faced with. It became my life mission to help my people and preserve our ancestral land. Shortly after returning to the United States I founded Go Conscious Earth, a nonprofit to carry out this mission.Help Make a DifferenceWhat we take for granted makes many sick and even die:
Approximately 1 billion people are affected by contaminated water annually
3.75 million people die from contaminated water annually
This is more than aids, malaria, and measles combined
These statistics make it very clear that having reliable access to clean water is a primary human need and is central to all other health and well-being initiatives. The Village Drill is an exciting new technology created by Village Solution's partners,  WHOlives.org, and
a team of Brigham Young University engineers. Designed to drill a 4"" to
8"" borehole up to 250 feet (80 meters) deep, the Village Drill can reach clean water sources in a matter of days relying solely on human energy.
 With this incredible new technology we can finally get ahead of the water crisis, bringing water to even the most remote areas for a fraction of the traditional costs.Return on InvestmentEach Village Drill is capable of creating significant value through drilling low-cost, high-impact wells. Completed wells are valued between $12,500 and $15,000.Each Village Drill unit has the potential to:
Drill at least 20 wells per year
Minimum of $250,000 worth of wells -- in just one year
With 2 Village Drills in operation we could easily create $500,000 worth of wells, bringing clean water to thousands of people in the Lac Tumba region -- each and every year.Giving Nurtures LifeGo Conscious Earth made tremendous strides in preserving biologically diverse ecosystems through the creation and management of strategic conservation areas. While we are encouraged by our supporters, our next steps are to nurture ecological health and social wellbeing by addressing water quality, soil conservation, wildlife protection, and conservation of threatened ecosystems.Last summer’s exploration helped establish the foundation for living out one of the organization’s mission of securing the preservation and land rights for approximately 1 million acres.  We were also able to distribute gravity flow water purification systems in eight villages that now have access to clean water.

<li>More than saving the cows from uncertain lives,<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>More than keeping raw milk available for the community,<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>More than preserving open space so people can enjoy the beauty of nature,<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>More than teaching our youth the values that farming teaches. </li>
</ul><p>Saving Easleigh Farm is about <strong>preserving an entire value system</strong> that includes all of the above and more.</p>
<p>What are some of the bigger issues that saving Eastleigh Farm addresses?</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the <strong>truth about the health benefits of ""real foods""</strong> that are grown without genetic modification (non-GMO), without chemicals and WITH all the nutrients that nature provides? Think about obesity and many of the other diseases that prevail.  <br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Is cruelty to animals necesary</strong> in farming?  Can a balance be found where animals are treated with respect, caring and grattude for the food they produce?<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>What happens to our health if we no longer have the ability to <strong>leave the stresses behind</strong> and enjoy a place of open space and freedom from the pressures and pollution that development brings?<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>Who really benefits if we no longer can <strong>show our children the differences and teach them through experience</strong>?<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>How can we <strong>teach a value system</strong> that is core to our keeping our country great and yet could disappear with the lifestyle if we do nothing?  We need the examples.  <strong>We need Eastleigh Farm!</strong>
</li>
</ol><p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/867117/pictures/full/20130612150404-eastleigh_farm.jpg?1371074648"" src="""" style=""float: right; margin: 5px 10px;""/>Here are just a few things we need to keep these values and Eastleigh alive:</p>
<ul>
<li>Constructing a maintenance building</li>
<li>Putting new roofs on the barns </li>
<li>Renovating the fence lines</li>
<li>Repairing tractors and equipment (some of these date to the early 1900s and are truly vintage equipment)</li>
<li>Re-seeding the many fields and pastures</li>
<li>Keeping the cows and calves healthy and happy</li>
<li>Paying the mortgage. (Perhaps this should be at the top of the list! :-)</li>
</ul><p>Please keep your contributions coming. They are immediately being put to great use.  The goal themometer is not the true goal.  We need more.</p>
<h2 align=""center""><strong>Eastleigh Farm Exemplifies what made America Great!</strong></h2>
<p>If there ever was an impact on America, it's America's farmers through their value systems, the growth from small farms to huge agricultural corporations, from initially ""organic"" methods to now GMO and chemical proliferation,  and from the amount of available acreage now being encroached by growing development. </p>
<p>Eastleigh Farm is trying to remain viable in one of the most developed areas of the country, Framingham, MA.  It exemplifies the small farmer and their fight for the standard of farming and healthy living that supported the growth of our country. </p>
<p>Eastleigh Farm is dedicated to humane and respectful treatment of its cows, preserving open space, and advocating for the health benefits and availability of raw milk and non-GMO, chemical free farming.  It represents a lifestyle: healthy living and educating our children about the fact that real food is better, and it's possible to eat AND treat our animals humanely.</p>
<p>Open space is core to giving our lives beauty. When we allow our animals the respect to share that space in exchange for their energy to provide us with healthy, nutrient dense food, things stay in balance. They are never slaughtered, and instead retired to pasture when they can no longer produce milk. </p>
<p>All of this is why we've become a nonprofit - to educate youth and share these facts.  So contribute and enjoy the perks for doing so!  Enjoy leaving your legacy to make the world a better place.</p>
<h2 align=""center""><strong>Have Fun as a Raw Milk Dairy Farmer<br/>(Without All the Work)</strong></h2>

<p>We've created several ways you can participate as a farmer:</p>
<ul>
<li>From the comfort of your home, and/or<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>For a visit in person to Eastleigh Farm, and/or<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>For a weekend in person to learn the ancient art of dairy farming.  You will milk cows, bottle the milk, make chees and ice cream.  Yum!</li>
</ul><p>Check out the perks to the right to choose the one best for you.</p>
<p>Having a dairy farm is constant work and expense.  Yet it's well worth it for the mental and physical health of all concerned.  In fact, there's an entire food movement based on the teaching and science of whole, natural foods, much to the disdain of many huge, processed food manufacturers. This is an important subject, and one we cover below, so please keep reading to learn more about Eastleigh Farm.</p>
<p>Most importantly, join the fun by contributing and sponsoring a share of Eastleigh Farm.  Without your support, Eastleigh Farm could be lost to development, and we would lose an important example of how a working, raw milk dairy can actually provide not just healthy and delicious dairy products, but a place to teach and learn, decompress and de-stress and balance the gifts the cows give with the respect we return to them in gratitude. </p>
<p>Due to this goal of educating people about healthy living and humanely treating the animals that work daily to provide us food rich in nutrients, we have recently created Eastleigh Farm Educational Foundation. Your contributions are tax-deductable.</p>
<p>Naturally, you'll be well acknowledged and appreciated for doing so. See our ""Perks"" to the right, and pick the one most appealing to you.  You'll be saving an important farm, supporting a great cause and helping future generations stay healthy.  Without your support, Eastleigh Farm could be lost to commercial development.</p>

<p> In 1981, the farm was transferred to a local businessman who owned it until 1996, operating as a beef farm.  A developer bought and owned it for six years, continuing to utilize the pastures to raise beef.  Eight years ago, I began the process of reconverting the facility to a dairy operation.  For me, it was a dream-come-true due to the fact that I worked on this farm as a kid.</p>

<p>The operation is very close to being organic without being certified.  Our raw milk is only available from our farm store.  It is produced according to the strict regulation of the Department of Agriculture.  A release form is required for all raw product sales according to state law.</p>
<p><img alt=""Yummy raw milk ice cream"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/866141/pictures/full/20130612083116-Ice_Cream_crop.jpg?1371051080"" src="""" style=""margin: 5px 10px; float: right;""/>In truth, raw milk is more healthy than any processed or pasteurized milk purchased in the store.  You can find out more about the health and taste advantages of raw milk by visiting the <a href=""http://www.westonaprice.org/about-the-foundation/about-the-foundation"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Weston Price Foundation</a> website, but first, make a contribution now for Eastleigh Farm, or be certain to return and do so.  Eastleigh must raise money now to keep providing this nutrient rich, raw milk and keep educating people about its benefits.</p>
<p>Previously, the milk produced was sold into the Federal milk pool.  I decided that the best way to serve the farm and potential customers was to sell the products on the farm.  In addition to raw milk produced on the farm, locally produced cheeses, eggs, fresh breads, honey and many other products are available by coming to the farm.</p>
<p>The State of Massachusetts is currently looking at legislation that would allow raw milk to be sold in stores and delivered.  When this happens, our ""market"" will explode with demand growing rapidly. This event will help sustain Eastleigh Farm if we can survive until then.  Your contribution will help assure we experience this delight.</p>

<p>Our girls never feel the need to flinch and often respond to hearing their names. We hold a commitment to never losing our humanity, our compassion or our respect for all that these cows give to life.</p>
<p>The herd consists of mostly Jerseys (high in butter fat) with a few Guernseys, and Brown Swiss. All of the cattle are born and raised on the two farms that are within close proximity to each other in Framingham, Massachusetts.</p>
<p>We graze our 300 cow herd on our own pastures, using the cows to naturally improve the soil and sustain the land. Allowing the cows fresh air, sunshine and green grass promotes their health and the quality of our products.</p>

I have experienced innumerable expressions of gratitude from people filled with happiness to experience a dairy which simultaneously cares for it's cows as family. It is difficult to put into words how this place has become a place of miracles. Young people have left self destructive lives behind, working here and taking care of the herd.</p>
<h3 align=""center""><strong>Why We Need Your Help</strong></h3>
<p>Small farming businesses have been hit hard with the failing economy.  Although our delicious, raw milk is constantly in demand, overall people have resorted to less healthy, cheaper foods.  The cost of maintaining a farm has increased as the cost of fuel has increased along with the cost of needed products. </p>
<p>As a nation, we need to stop and really see how processed foods are robbing us of our health.  We need to slow down and appreciate the natural and rural way of life where stress is not a chronic disease.  We need to keep the rural life alive for our children and generations to come.</p>
<p>Due to my dedication and love for Eastleigh Farm as one of the last open expanses of land and for the cows and people who have helped keep the farm alive, I have used my own resources to maintain it.  I can no longer do this, and must rely on the American people as a whole to recognize the need to keep the small farms alive and healthy. </p>
<p><img alt=""Our tractors need your help"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/834138/pictures/full/20130527130532-old_tractor.jpg?1369685136"" src="""" style=""float: left; margin: 5px 10px;""/>Our failing economy is bringing people to their senses in many ways.  The important things in life are becoming more apparent.  I’m hoping that you will recognize the need to preserve organic farms and specifically to help Eastleigh Farm  stay alive and resilient so we can show how the small farmer is still the foundation of our country and certainly of our country’s health, both physical and mental.  We have jobs and lives to protect including those of the cows and farm animals.  It is possible to live and thrive humanely.</p>

What is the truth about the health benefits of ""real foods"" that are grown without genetic modification (non-GMO), without chemicals and WITH all the nutrients that nature provides? Think about obesity and many of the other diseases that prevail.  


Is cruelty to animals necesary in farming?  Can a balance be found where animals are treated with respect, caring and grattude for the food they produce?

What happens to our health if we no longer have the ability to leave the stresses behind and enjoy a place of open space and freedom from the pressures and pollution that development brings?

Who really benefits if we no longer can show our children the differences and teach them through experience?

How can we teach a value system that is core to our keeping our country great and yet could disappear with the lifestyle if we do nothing?  We need the examples.  We need Eastleigh Farm!

Here are just a few things we need to keep these values and Eastleigh alive:

Constructing a maintenance building
Putting new roofs on the barns 
Renovating the fence lines
Repairing tractors and equipment (some of these date to the early 1900s and are truly vintage equipment)
Re-seeding the many fields and pastures
Keeping the cows and calves healthy and happy
Paying the mortgage. (Perhaps this should be at the top of the list! :-)
Please keep your contributions coming. They are immediately being put to great use.  The goal themometer is not the true goal.  We need more.
Eastleigh Farm Exemplifies what made America Great!
If there ever was an impact on America, it's America's farmers through their value systems, the growth from small farms to huge agricultural corporations, from initially ""organic"" methods to now GMO and chemical proliferation,  and from the amount of available acreage now being encroached by growing development. 
Eastleigh Farm is trying to remain viable in one of the most developed areas of the country, Framingham, MA.  It exemplifies the small farmer and their fight for the standard of farming and healthy living that supported the growth of our country. 
Eastleigh Farm is dedicated to humane and respectful treatment of its cows, preserving open space, and advocating for the health benefits and availability of raw milk and non-GMO, chemical free farming.  It represents a lifestyle: healthy living and educating our children about the fact that real food is better, and it's possible to eat AND treat our animals humanely.
Open space is core to giving our lives beauty. When we allow our animals the respect to share that space in exchange for their energy to provide us with healthy, nutrient dense food, things stay in balance. They are never slaughtered, and instead retired to pasture when they can no longer produce milk. 
All of this is why we've become a nonprofit - to educate youth and share these facts.  So contribute and enjoy the perks for doing so!  Enjoy leaving your legacy to make the world a better place.
Have Fun as a Raw Milk Dairy Farmer(Without All the Work)
With all the virtual games about farming and animals, we thought it would be a great opportunity to share some real fun with people.  
We've created several ways you can participate as a farmer:

From the comfort of your home, and/or

For a visit in person to Eastleigh Farm, and/or

For a weekend in person to learn the ancient art of dairy farming.  You will milk cows, bottle the milk, make chees and ice cream.  Yum!
Check out the perks to the right to choose the one best for you.
Having a dairy farm is constant work and expense.  Yet it's well worth it for the mental and physical health of all concerned.  In fact, there's an entire food movement based on the teaching and science of whole, natural foods, much to the disdain of many huge, processed food manufacturers. This is an important subject, and one we cover below, so please keep reading to learn more about Eastleigh Farm.
Most importantly, join the fun by contributing and sponsoring a share of Eastleigh Farm.  Without your support, Eastleigh Farm could be lost to development, and we would lose an important example of how a working, raw milk dairy can actually provide not just healthy and delicious dairy products, but a place to teach and learn, decompress and de-stress and balance the gifts the cows give with the respect we return to them in gratitude. 
Due to this goal of educating people about healthy living and humanely treating the animals that work daily to provide us food rich in nutrients, we have recently created Eastleigh Farm Educational Foundation. Your contributions are tax-deductable.
Naturally, you'll be well acknowledged and appreciated for doing so. See our ""Perks"" to the right, and pick the one most appealing to you.  You'll be saving an important farm, supporting a great cause and helping future generations stay healthy.  Without your support, Eastleigh Farm could be lost to commercial development.
Last Expanse of Open Land in Framingham, MA.
Eastleigh Farm was established in the early 1900’s.  It stayed in the same family, operating as a Guernsey dairy until 1981.  This farm, as an important part of the community, was responsible for a lot of the improvements being brought to the area like the sewer, clean water and more.  Originally 468 acres, some refer to this farm as the jewel of Framingham.
 In 1981, the farm was transferred to a local businessman who owned it until 1996, operating as a beef farm.  A developer bought and owned it for six years, continuing to utilize the pastures to raise beef.  Eight years ago, I began the process of reconverting the facility to a dairy operation.  For me, it was a dream-come-true due to the fact that I worked on this farm as a kid.

Natural Dairy Products:  Sold Out Every Week

Through its most recent history, only natural land enhancements have been used including organic fish oil and seaweed, to supplement the growing of grass and hay used at the farm.  Having been involved in the dairy business all of my life, I have never used pesticides or artificial enhancements in any of the farm operations.
The operation is very close to being organic without being certified.  Our raw milk is only available from our farm store.  It is produced according to the strict regulation of the Department of Agriculture.  A release form is required for all raw product sales according to state law.
In truth, raw milk is more healthy than any processed or pasteurized milk purchased in the store.  You can find out more about the health and taste advantages of raw milk by visiting the Weston Price Foundation website, but first, make a contribution now for Eastleigh Farm, or be certain to return and do so.  Eastleigh must raise money now to keep providing this nutrient rich, raw milk and keep educating people about its benefits.
Previously, the milk produced was sold into the Federal milk pool.  I decided that the best way to serve the farm and potential customers was to sell the products on the farm.  In addition to raw milk produced on the farm, locally produced cheeses, eggs, fresh breads, honey and many other products are available by coming to the farm.
The State of Massachusetts is currently looking at legislation that would allow raw milk to be sold in stores and delivered.  When this happens, our ""market"" will explode with demand growing rapidly. This event will help sustain Eastleigh Farm if we can survive until then.  Your contribution will help assure we experience this delight.

Our “Girls” are Appreciated Family Members. 

The ""girls"" are pastured and grass fed throughout most of the year. Problems which would automatically result in cows or calves being put down are instead treated. Very often, they recover and thrive.
Our girls never feel the need to flinch and often respond to hearing their names. We hold a commitment to never losing our humanity, our compassion or our respect for all that these cows give to life.
The herd consists of mostly Jerseys (high in butter fat) with a few Guernseys, and Brown Swiss. All of the cattle are born and raised on the two farms that are within close proximity to each other in Framingham, Massachusetts.
We graze our 300 cow herd on our own pastures, using the cows to naturally improve the soil and sustain the land. Allowing the cows fresh air, sunshine and green grass promotes their health and the quality of our products.
The Local Community Loves Us.
Volunteers ranging from little children through elders help with the 140 or so calves and with milking. I have experienced innumerable expressions of gratitude from people filled with happiness to experience a dairy which simultaneously cares for it's cows as family. It is difficult to put into words how this place has become a place of miracles. Young people have left self destructive lives behind, working here and taking care of the herd.
Why We Need Your Help
Small farming businesses have been hit hard with the failing economy.  Although our delicious, raw milk is constantly in demand, overall people have resorted to less healthy, cheaper foods.  The cost of maintaining a farm has increased as the cost of fuel has increased along with the cost of needed products. 
As a nation, we need to stop and really see how processed foods are robbing us of our health.  We need to slow down and appreciate the natural and rural way of life where stress is not a chronic disease.  We need to keep the rural life alive for our children and generations to come.
Due to my dedication and love for Eastleigh Farm as one of the last open expanses of land and for the cows and people who have helped keep the farm alive, I have used my own resources to maintain it.  I can no longer do this, and must rely on the American people as a whole to recognize the need to keep the small farms alive and healthy. 
Our failing economy is bringing people to their senses in many ways.  The important things in life are becoming more apparent.  I’m hoping that you will recognize the need to preserve organic farms and specifically to help Eastleigh Farm  stay alive and resilient so we can show how the small farmer is still the foundation of our country and certainly of our country’s health, both physical and mental.  We have jobs and lives to protect including those of the cows and farm animals.  It is possible to live and thrive humanely.

Contribución
En el valor de cada contribución están incluidos conceptos como, además de todas las horas que pasamos pensando en todos los detalles para que no falte de nada, las horas de diseño, las horas de programación las horas de test, etc. así como todos los trabajos posteriores para las mejoras de la aplicación.
  También contribuyes al beneficio social que la aplicación aportará a la comunidad de usuarios en todos los sentidos.
Como creemos de verdad en su utilidad, queremos que la aplicación llegue al mayor número de personas y hemos decidido no pasar de los 5$. Estimamos que la aplicación posteriormente saldrá a la venta por un precio de entre 7$ y 10$ con lo cual el ahorro para todos los que apoyáis el proyecto sería de entre un 30% y un 50%.

Contribution
In the value of each contribution are included concepts such as, besides all the hours we spend thinking about all the details so you do not miss anything, research hours, the hours of designing, programming hours, testing hours, etc.. as well as all subsequent work for application enhancements.
  Also you contribute to social benefits that the application will provide the user community in all ways.
As we truly believe in its usefulness, we want the application to reach the greatest number of people and we decided not to rise the 5€ price. We estimate that the application will be released later for a price of between 7€ and 10€ with which the savings for everyone who support the project would be between 30% and 50%.

<p>My name is Dr. Brian Jones and I am ready to change the world through a dream. <br/></p> <p><span>Allow
me to explain why I do what I do. When I was a teenager, I severely injured my
lower back. Doctors told me I would never walk
again. Through determination, trial and error and with the caring support of
various physical therapists I was able to overcome the pain, the symptoms and to
learn how to walk, run, and live again. Everything I do has been as a result of
the things I have experienced throughout my life. Whether good, or bad, they
have all led me to this moment, and this opportunity. My dream is to create a
way to help people heal through physical therapy. People all over the world do
not get the care they need at the time they need it. We need to make
information and proper treatment accessible to anyone from anywhere at
affordable costs. I want to be the first to make this dream a reality. </span><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>I believe in thinking outside of the usual parameters
of healthcare. I have created a brand new approach on how to heal, repair
peoples' bodies and get them out of pain. I know we can all live productive and
rewarding lives void of pain if given the right way to do it.</p>
<p><span>The
modern medical system is backwards, drugs and surgery first, rehab after. I
believe it should be the complete opposite; rehab first, and surgery only as a
last resort. It has been my experience that this method can actually fix the
issue, and it can all be done without pills, without drugs or injections and
especially without surgery. </span><br/></p>
<p>

<p>Not until the laws and practices of

The web-based Chronic Wellness Tracker helps people take control of chronic illness.
Did
you know that 50% of the adults in this country have a chronic illness? Chronic illness touches all of us in some way or another. And while chronic illness can take many forms, it often leaves people feeling isolated, powerless, and unsure what to do. But people don't have to feel powerless in the face of chronic illness! 
If you have a chronic illness, the more you know about your symptoms, diet, activities... about which treatments work and which do not... the quicker you'll get better. 
To help people on their journey to wellness, we created an online tool that makes it easy to gather and analyze this important data. It's a powerful tracking tool that can foster healing through better self-awareness, knowledge, empowerment, and hope. It's called Chronic Wellness Tracker, and you can try it yourself at cwt.ChronicWellnessTools.com.
Now we are bringing the power of mobile technology to Chronic Wellness Tracker, and we need your help. 


Take a Brief Tour of the Web-based Wellness Tracker.
See how our online tracking tool is helping people on their journey back to health.
It’s working! Each day, more and more people are using our website and discovering the benefits of Chronic Wellness Tracker. Let's help even more people by taking it mobile.


With our mobile app, you will be able to take the benefits of Chronic Wellness Tracker with you wherever you go. 

Preliminary designs for the mobile App.
See more design images in our gallery.


What's the next step?

If we meet our $27,000 funding goal, we'll be able to create an iOS mobile
companion app to our online tracking tool that will run on iPhones and iPads, and perform some valuable upgrades on the online tracker.  This will allow  us to bring tracking to more of the people who need it most. Tracking is more powerful when people can enter and access their information whenever they want and wherever they are.
If we fall short of our goal but raise at least $15,000, we will build a “lite” version of the app that we can later expand into the full version. If we exceed our goal, our plan is to integrate more of our users' ""wish list"" feature requests, including a practitioner version. If you help really knock our funding out of the park, we can roll out the app to Android too, thereby reaching even more people.

<h3>Summary:</h3>
<p>My name is Chelsea Gray from Merrickville Ontario. I've been blessed with the most amazing family, friends, and community; but on July 5th, 2012 my life changed forever. On July 5th My father died from colon, lung, and liver cancer. He was diagnosed in April 2012 and was very sick for a very short amount of time. </p>
<p>Last summer I kayaked the 200km Rideau River (Kingston to Ottawa) with my best friend, Julia, my brothers Robert and Michael and 31 others who have also been affected by cancer. Together we collected  roughly $40,000 that was donated to the Canadian Cancer Society. </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>I'm looking for a goal of $1,000 to donate to Kayking for Cancer/ The Canadian Cancer Society. It could make a huge difference to a family, a community, and our country. Kayaking for Cancer has spent 12 years and roughly 95 days paddling 2,404 kilometres to raise over $455,00 for the Canadian Cancer Society!</p>
<p>On the website, <a href=""http://www.kayakingforcancer.com/index.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.kayakingforcancer.com/index.html</a> , you will be able to see the groups' journey down the Rideau River through the Journal portion of the website.

<p><strong>The Impact:<br/><br/></strong>I have been involved in many fundraisers for Cancer but Kayaking for Cancer has a special place in my heart. Kayaking for Cancer is an amazing foudation that was started by a former guidence counciler at the high school I went to.

<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Details.<br/>
</h3>
<p>We have a registered nutraceutical manufacturing laboratory standing by so we can have the first units of BURN 250 NX produced within two weeks putting down a 50% deposit. That means, as soon as we get halfway to our fundraising goal, we can start producing the product for shipment to you.  The final 50% has to be paid before the product leaves the manufacturing facility. The fulfillment center is ready and waiting to ship the product to your door.<br/></p>
<p>Depending on how quickly people join in, we could potentially be shipping product to you within 30 days of starting this campaign (October/November).<br/></p>

<h3>If we exceed our goal. </h3>
<p></p>
<p>If we exceed our goal we can do a larger production run and if we have enough we can then focus on developing our next product. This is something we would like your help with as well. If you could design your ideal health product, what would it be? What benefits are your seeking? We are happy to design something specific for you. The chances are that if you like it then others would like it as well.  This is how we started and how we would like to grow.</p>
<p>We cannot promise to produce every product suggested, but we will consider any ideas you might have and if we end up mass producing a product using your suggested formulation, we will of course give you some product free. <br/></p>

<h3>Bañado Sur - Paraguay
– Health, what matters most.</h3>
<h3>The Health Center is
flooded! Help us improve it AMAZING REWARDS!</h3>
<p>My
name is Emilio Sanchez, I live in Asunción Paraguay, know where it is? Since I
started helping people I haven’t stopped, I thank God, I am lucky to have a
job, live in an apartment with my wife Alexandra, eat and live well.Unfortunately in my country, rarely (not saying never)
people who need it most receive government help, it hurts my heart, seeing so
many people who are not lucky enough to have what you and I have, to have
parents who support you (I do not have them) and live well, I mainly concerned
about the health of women, children and elderly people. </p>
<p>A
neighborhood of Asunción (Capital of Paraguay) that the government forgot,
forget and will continue forgeting. People like you, like me, but with fewer
opportunities and luck in life.</p>
<p>Currently,
the Health Center of San Blas in Bañado Sur of Asunción Paraguay go through the
worst time, attending to their patients between puddles, which is gradually
growing by the flood, the desperate residents organized raffles and food sales to
raise funds because they call them ""The Forgotten"" they strove to
lift up, at least a little of their Health Center, as the next closest is 19
miles away. You have a car? They don’t, you have private insurance, they don’t,
you have a fridge full of food? they don’t.</p>
<p>We
are raising funds to lift up this Health Center, as repeatedly we talked to the
government, but the only thing they say is ""No budget"" but you know
what? I look at the title of the main newspaper of my country ""<a href=""http://www.abc.com.py/nacionales/corte-se-autosigna-millonario-cupo-de-combustible-1263960.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">They self-assigned millions for fuel in the Supreme Court</a>"" for a total of $
130,000 USD per year! Can you believe it? Fuel! Help us help.</p>

– Health, what matters most.
The Health Center is
flooded! Help us improve it AMAZING REWARDS!
My
name is Emilio Sanchez, I live in Asunción Paraguay, know where it is? Since I
started helping people I haven’t stopped, I thank God, I am lucky to have a
job, live in an apartment with my wife Alexandra, eat and live well.Unfortunately in my country, rarely (not saying never)
people who need it most receive government help, it hurts my heart, seeing so
many people who are not lucky enough to have what you and I have, to have
parents who support you (I do not have them) and live well, I mainly concerned
about the health of women, children and elderly people. 
A
neighborhood of Asunción (Capital of Paraguay) that the government forgot,
forget and will continue forgeting. People like you, like me, but with fewer
opportunities and luck in life.
Currently,
the Health Center of San Blas in Bañado Sur of Asunción Paraguay go through the
worst time, attending to their patients between puddles, which is gradually
growing by the flood, the desperate residents organized raffles and food sales to
raise funds because they call them ""The Forgotten"" they strove to
lift up, at least a little of their Health Center, as the next closest is 19
miles away. You have a car? They don’t, you have private insurance, they don’t,
you have a fridge full of food? they don’t.
We
are raising funds to lift up this Health Center, as repeatedly we talked to the
government, but the only thing they say is ""No budget"" but you know
what? I look at the title of the main newspaper of my country ""They self-assigned millions for fuel in the Supreme Court"" for a total of $
130,000 USD per year! Can you believe it? Fuel! Help us help.

<p>It is heartbreaking when you see your loved ones age and slowly lose their independence.  They become more and more reliant on special
services and products. 
Trying to find these services can be difficult for a family who wants their elder relatives to
age at home gracefully.  Services can be
unreliable, and only the best should be satisfactory for our loved ones.  This inconvenience forces
many families to send their aging parents or grandparents to nursing homes, assisted care
facilities, or relative’s houses.</p>
<p><b>Seniors don’t want to leave home</b>.  According to the
American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), almost 90% of people over the
age of 65 wanted to spend their days at home.

Our mission at AmelioCare, a social enterprise, is to give seniors
the independence they need to stay at home.  We are the platform that will allow
seniors and their families to connect with the products and services they
need.  Simply login to our site and you are
immediately exposed to the highest rated local health services and businesses. We provide
the online, one-stop-shop for curated and reviewed products and services,
specifically tailored for the elderly.
Businesses and
services that list with AmelioCare will be reviewed by consumers and rated by
AmelioCare employees.  Only those businesses and services that meet a
minimum quality requirement will be approved.










Who We Are
We are a group of
talented high school students at MIT, with skills ranging from marketing and finance to management and web development. We have all had experience working at or starting our own companies. We took this opportunity to make a genuine difference and solve a prominent problem in our society. 




What We Need
In order to launch this platform, we are asking for $5000. These funds will allow us to program the backend and database of the website. Here is the breakdown of funds:

$3000 - Sofware Development
$1000 - Marketing
$500 - Incorporation
$500 - Web Hosting and Database Storage

We began our work in 2011 as a small group of lacrosse enthusiasts and throughout the years we grew into a team which successfully plays against and collaborates with other regional lacrosse teams (Budapest BLAX, Belgrade Zombies, Ljubljana Olimpija and Zagreb Bulldogs). Through this successful collaboration the teams decided to found a regional lacrosse league to promote lacrosse in this part of Europe. Because lacrosse is a genuine team sport in which players work together as one, we believe this initiative will help to bridge the gap and improve the relations between countries in this region. Lacrosse in this region is still developing and the support it can gain from sponsors and contributors is minimal, therefore, to achieve our goal we require financial support from contributors who believe in our vision.<br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>To achieve this we need a minimal financial support. Because the average travel distance is around 300 kilometers (190 miles) the majority of the 15 000 USD we require would be used to cover travel expenses of each team competing in the League. Without these funds, all costs, from travel expenses and tournament fees to food and stay, have to be covered by the players themselves. This poses a serious problem due to a global and regional financial crisis and may take a toll on the player's morale. Each contributor, whether they donate 10 or 10 000 USD, will have their name written on the League's website ""Wall of Gratitude"", but larger perks (larger than 100 USD) will get signed photographs, T-shirts or jerseys and a personalized thank you card. Even if we do not reach our goal, all of the accumulated funds will go towards covering the most necessary player's expenses, such as travel expenses, food and stay, depending on the amount of funds accumulated.<br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>All regional lacrosse projects began with a small group of lacrosse enthusiasts. At first the teams did not have a proper place to train, nor even the basic equipment, but they were propelled by the player's enthusiasm and love for the sport. Due to generous donations from foreign lacrosse teams and other lacrosse enthusiast, we have been able to continue promoting this sport in the region, but we rely on further donations and your support to achieve our ultimate goal of founding the regional League.</p><p></p><h3>Previous Projects</h3><p>In January 2014, after a period of planning with our Slovenian and Serbian colleagues and in order to improve relations, increase cooperation and deepen the bond between these teams, a mixed team of Slovenian, Serbian and Croatian players called ""Balkan Stars"" was created and performed in ""New Years Cup"" in Budapest.

Every morning’s brightness is different. And the pupils in your eyes constantly adjust to the light levels around you – this is how you can see things in both daylight and starlight. Unfortunately, this adaptability makes your eyes a bad judge of brightness. SunSprite makes it effortless to track all your light exposure – from bright, sunny days to sunset hikes with your pup.</p>

Light works through our eyes. (This is different from how vitamin D is produced, which is by UV light reaching our skin.) When bright light enters the eyes, it stimulates specialized receptor cells in the retina that have connections to the suprachiasmatic nucleus in the brain – the “master pacemaker.” From there, the effects spread – more widely than doctors and scientists once thought.</p>
<p style=""color: #444; font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"">

Bright light sets the rhythms of our bodies, our minds, and our lives. When those internal rhythms are out of sync with our day, we feel “<a href=""http://www.sunsprite.com/blog/sleep-and-social-jet-lag/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">social jet lag</a>.” But it’s not just a feeling. “Circadian synchronization” improves sleep, mood, alertness, cognitive performance, and well-being.</p>

Scientific studies over the last 30 years have concluded that light therapy is just as effective as antidepressant medication not only for seasonal depression (SAD) but also for <i>non-seasonal</i> depression. And further research has found that bright light may also benefit a wide range of medical conditions including insomnia, ADHD, Parkinson’s disease, and dementia.</p>
<p style=""color: #444; font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"">

Light improves the health of the healthy, too. Those positive effects on sleep, mood, alertness, cognitive performance, and well-being apply to <i>everyone</i>. In addition, a recent study found that adding morning bright light to a weight control program helps reduce body fat and appetite.</p>

Head to SunSprite.com.

SunSprite is the first wearable device that tracks your daily light and sun exposure. Use it on its own to measure bright light, or sync it with your smartphone to measure UV index and to deliver a personalized set of goals and tips to make sure you get the right amount of bright light to support your healthy lifestyle.
SunSprite is a leap forward in wearable technology. It's completely solar-powered. No cords or plugs. No batteries to replace. No essential cable to forget in a hotel in Des Moines.Wear SunSprite anywhere with its advanced flexible magnetic clasp. We made the magnets strong enough to go through even the thickest of winter jackets (we live in Boston, so we know about this). Just clip it in a place that gets the same amount of light your eyes do, and let SunSprite do all the work.



Getting bright light at the right time of day is clinically proven to boost your energy and help you sleep better. See Bright Light & the Human Brain below for the science behind SunSprite and bright light.SunSprite’s dual sensors measure the brightness of both visible and UV light so you can make sure you’re getting the right amount of light — enough visible light to be healthy while avoiding too many harmful UV rays. SunSprite's LED display (as well as its smartphone app) can tell you if the light you're in is bright enough to be beneficial.

On top of this, bright light has been linked to proper eye development, reduced incidence of ADHD, lower blood pressure, reduction in body fat, and strong Vitamin D levels.
You might be asking yourself: Can’t my eyes measure brightness?


Every morning’s brightness is different. And the pupils in your eyes constantly adjust to the light levels around you – this is how you can see things in both daylight and starlight. Unfortunately, this adaptability makes your eyes a bad judge of brightness. SunSprite makes it effortless to track all your light exposure – from bright, sunny days to sunset hikes with your pup.







Watch our CTO Kasey geek out about the amazing technology behind SunSprite.

On top of all that, we also have a wicked cool app. It was developed by Raizlabs, the same team that crafted RunKeeper. The SunSprite app is accessible on iOS-devices (iPhone 4S or newer). And don't worry Android users, your app is coming next!  Check out a few screenshots to see how SunSprite gives you the 360 bright light experience.






Light works through our eyes. (This is different from how vitamin D is produced, which is by UV light reaching our skin.) When bright light enters the eyes, it stimulates specialized receptor cells in the retina that have connections to the suprachiasmatic nucleus in the brain – the “master pacemaker.” From there, the effects spread – more widely than doctors and scientists once thought.


Bright light sets the rhythms of our bodies, our minds, and our lives. When those internal rhythms are out of sync with our day, we feel “social jet lag.” But it’s not just a feeling. “Circadian synchronization” improves sleep, mood, alertness, cognitive performance, and well-being.



Scientific studies over the last 30 years have concluded that light therapy is just as effective as antidepressant medication not only for seasonal depression (SAD) but also for non-seasonal depression. And further research has found that bright light may also benefit a wide range of medical conditions including insomnia, ADHD, Parkinson’s disease, and dementia.


Light improves the health of the healthy, too. Those positive effects on sleep, mood, alertness, cognitive performance, and well-being apply to everyone. In addition, a recent study found that adding morning bright light to a weight control program helps reduce body fat and appetite.

(Quick clarification -- the Suprachiasmatic nucleus doesn't control all your hormones, just a lot of them.)Light is easy to get – if it’s bright enough, you only need 30 minutes a day. And because the beneficial effects of bright light come through your eyes, you don't even need to be outside. Small lifestyle changes, like eating your breakfast while facing a sunny window, can make all the difference.


For a more in-depth look at the hard science behind bright light and its benefits, check out the White Paper written by our medical co-founders, who are Associate Clinical Professors at Harvard Medical School who recommend bright light to their patients in their private practices.







We dream of brightening the lives of as many people as possible. But to do this, we need your help.



We’ve already done a lot on our own. We’ve finished design and development of SunSprite, and we have a handful of real, working prototypes (you saw them above!). We’re ready to send our designs off to a factory in the USA to be mass-produced, but we need to cover the up-front costs of producing each SunSprite. That’s why we’re asking for your support and contributions. 



We’re also asking for your feedback. We want to know how we could make SunSprite even better.

<p>The Carrizal Water Initiative is a joint effort between two non-profit organizations, FUPAC (<a href=""http://www.fupac.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.fupac.org/</a>) and UT for REED (<a href=""http://sites.google.com/site/ut4reed/aboutus"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://sites.google.com/site/ut4reed/aboutus</a>), a student organization at The University of Texas at Austin.</p>
<p><strong>Project Goals:<br/></strong></p>
<p>The two organizations will be assisting the Dominican community of Carrizal this August to establish a sustainable, gravity-flow aqueduct and accompanying health and sanitation campaign that will serve to remedy Carrizal’s current water situation. To accomplish this, the following tasks will be central to the project:<br/><br/>1. The construction of a gravity-flow, PVC aqueduct water network</p>
<p>2. The installment of on-site clay filtration systems to remove water-born pathogens</p>
<p>3. The implementation of health and sanitation workshops in the community</p>
<p><strong>Ensuring Sustainability:</strong></p>
<p>Emphasis will also been given to the social infrastructure of Carrizal such that the project will be sustained beyond our organizations' presence in the region. With this in mind, we will also focus on the following:</p>
<p>1. The establishment of a standing water committee</p>

The Carrizal Water Initiative is a joint effort between two non-profit organizations, FUPAC (http://www.fupac.org/) and UT for REED (http://sites.google.com/site/ut4reed/aboutus), a student organization at The University of Texas at Austin.
Project Goals:
The two organizations will be assisting the Dominican community of Carrizal this August to establish a sustainable, gravity-flow aqueduct and accompanying health and sanitation campaign that will serve to remedy Carrizal’s current water situation. To accomplish this, the following tasks will be central to the project:1. The construction of a gravity-flow, PVC aqueduct water network
2. The installment of on-site clay filtration systems to remove water-born pathogens
3. The implementation of health and sanitation workshops in the community
Ensuring Sustainability:
Emphasis will also been given to the social infrastructure of Carrizal such that the project will be sustained beyond our organizations' presence in the region. With this in mind, we will also focus on the following:
1. The establishment of a standing water committee
2. The inculcation of a feeling of ownership by the community
3. The training of a group of local plumbers
4. The creation of a bank account to manage funds needed for upkeep
5. The establishment of a monthly quota for the water system’s use
Ultimately, the standing committee will develop a broader role in the community and elect a board of directors to make decisions regarding other environmental issues; it will also encourage a feeling of community responsibility for the system. Thus, through the implementation of the pipe system, the health/sanitation campaign, and the standing committee, FUPAC and REED hope to create a long-lasting, comprehensive water solution for the region.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

According to experts from the University of Minnesota and the Mayo Clinic, one in three Minnesota adults is either diabetic or pre-diabetic, and one in four is obese.  The CDC reports that adults with disabilities have an even higher rate of obesity.  The team of researchers believe that even modest increases in daily activity could help people lose weight and improve their health.  Disabled adults may not have access to recreational activities, and they or their caregivers may need instruction and reminders on proper nutrition and lifestyle choices.
Angie and Ryan Green have created a fun and informative 30-day Wellness Challenge designed specifically for adults with disabilities living in group homes.  They have consulted with a number of field professionals to put together a customized, engaging, hands-on experience.
Every free session for a group home with four residents includes:

$350 worth of handouts, positive behavior tracking displays, a blender, and 60 servings of free healthy shake product for group home residents and staff,
pre- and post- evaluations to gather information, and
Kickoff and Awards parties with fun prizes!

<p align=""center"">Did you know…?</p>
<p align=""center""><em>Diarrhea kills 2-million children per year- UN, WHO</em></p>
<p align=""center""><em>One child dies of a preventable death every 30- seconds.</em></p>
<p align=""center""><em>Soap usage can reduce diarrhea rates from 30-60 percent…</em></p>
<p align=""center""><strong> </strong></p>
<p class=""paragraph"">ABOUT: â€¯One major challenge to the rural development in Kenya is the death rate which often comes as a result of HIV &amp; AIDS. </p>
<p class=""paragraph"">FACT: â€¯Men are more prone to stigma than Women. â€¯ </p>
<p class=""paragraph"">THE IDEA: â€¯A group of 30 women, surprisingly have their own empowerment group, and they are all HIV positive and are all widows taking care of orphaned children too.</p>
<p class=""paragraph"">WHAT DO THEY DO FOR A LIVING? Being that they are all coming from along the lake, they practice Village Commercial Sex Work with fishermen and anybody who has thirst for sex. They have to exchange their bodies with fish so that they are able to bring food on the table. They use their income from sex to rear chickens, make Mary-go-Round contributions, and buy food.  </p>
<p class=""paragraph"">HOW DANGERIOUS IS THIS? In a month, they can have sex with a minimum of 5 different people and max of 27. They rarely use a condom because most fishermen still believes in myths about condom use. They are not alone, after having heart-to-heart discussions with them, we have realized that there are many more women and girls like them who are not in their group but exchange their body for food. </p>
<p class=""paragraph"">WHAT DO THEY WANT TO DO WITH THEIR CHICKENS? They have so far managed to buy 41 chickens, and they hope to be able to sell the chickens and start up a sustainable business in the future once the number of the chickens grows high. These are local breed chickens, and they are just locally kept without proper care since they cannot afford to start up a reasonable chicken project because of the poverty situation.  </p>
<p class=""paragraph"">POTENTIAL SUSTAINABLE PROJECT: After several meetings with them, we did market research on several business options which could sustain their family needs, so they can stop the sex for food exchange, which risks life of everyone in the community.   </p>
<p class=""paragraph"">THEIR PROPOSAL: â€¯We need your help to purchase soap making mold and equipment that will be used to start a soap making project. Your funds will buy local merchants in Kenya for the 30 women and enable them start up a sustainable project. â€¯We plan to spend weeks with the women to train them on how to make good products. We also plan to help them with marketing their products too, and then leave the equipment for them to use to provide themselves an income for their family. </p>
<p class=""paragraph"">HOW CAN YOU MAKE A DIFFERENCE NOW: â€¯We need to raise $7,500 in order to buy mold that has the capacity of making 200 bars soap a day. These women have agreed to sign an agreement to quit sex once they have this project and they will also create employment to 10 women after every 6 months plus take their girls to Secondary School. </p>

<p><strong>Dear friends,</strong></p>
<p>We are a group of students from the College of William and Mary, and we are working to raise funds to assist a Peace Corp volunteer by the name of Ryan Browning in installing water storage tanks for the community of Agua de Luis, Dominican Republic. This storage tank can hold up to 10,000 liters of rainwater for families without access to clean water. Every dollar donated will go directly to buy materials, not to any administrative or overhead costs. All project labor will be donated by members of the community. Citizens of Agua de Luis have been working to raise their promised portion of the investment, and we are now trying to help Mr. Browning raise the remaining $3000 necessary to complete the project. Furthermore, we want to use kickstarter to fund $500 for a part of $3000 we want to raise, which is almost one water tank for one family. As we will be visiting this community, we would love to be able to bring a donation with us to help accomplish this wonderful project.</p>

<p>Agua de Luis (“Luis’ Water”) consists of roughly 90 families and around 400 residents.  The population is a mix of both Dominicans and Haitians.  Located 18 kilometers north of the nation’s principal highway and 20 kilometers south of the Atlantic Ocean, Agua de Luis is a community without water, electricity or a paved road, yet still able to sustain its economy through agriculture.  The revenue generated from selling dairy milk and harvesting tobacco are the main sources of income.</p>
<p>The community endures a lack of a permanent, sustaining water source.  In this dry climate, families depend upon capturing rain water during the brief rainy season each winter.  In order to capture the rain, community members utilize their available roof space and have put up both zinc and plastic gutters to direct the flow of water to large, above ground cement tanks.  During the late 1990’s a European development organization named Prolino built numerous 5,000 liter tanks for individual households.  However, many families still lack a large storage tank thus rendering their existing system ineffective.</p>
<p><strong>Project Objectives</strong></p>
<p>Our proposed plan is to build ten (10) 10,000 liter tanks for ten (10) families that currently do not have a means of storing rain water.  Each benefiting family will provide 5,000 pesos (US$128) and a portion of the work brigade.  In addition, the community’s water committee will provide the framework for planning and implementation.  Local masons and skilled labor will be trained in ferrocement technology by current Peace Corps Volunteers. Building one tank takes 5 days, thus resulting in 2 solid months of construction to complete all ten tanks.</p>
<p>Project objectives include providing a means of storing large quantities of rain water to be used for human consumption as well as agricultural, cooking, bathing and cleaning purposes. Another objective involves training local masons and skilled labor how to work with ferrocement technology as a means of augmenting their work potential.  We are aiming at achieving sustainability by implementing this project through the community’s self run water committee. The committee has been meeting monthly for the past year and has already begun collection payments from the 10 families.   </p>
<p><strong>Progress to Date:</strong></p>
<p>A 3-month Peace Corps Community Diagnostic was completed upon Ryan's arrival to Agua de Luis, based on interviews and appropriate observation techniques with 90 families.  The diagnostic provided significant information regarding the current water use, access to water, methods of collecting rain water as well as the potential effects of composting latrines, cement floors and environmental education.  By broad consensus it was agreed that rain water catchment systems are the community’s greatest need.</p>
<p>In order to carry out the various water related projects that were mentioned during the Diagnostic, a community wide Water Committee was formed.  Meeting once a month in the local community center, members have overseen the completion of 40 Bio-Sand Water Filters provided for by Rotary International as well as the installation of 80 rain water catchment systems which utilize 3” PVC pipes.  The construction of the aforementioned tanks remains the Committee’s first and most important goal.</p>
<p>The Committee has begun to collect monthly payments from the beneficiaries which are deposited in a dedicated account.  Local masons attended the construction of a similar rain water storage tank in a neighboring community to better gain an understanding of ferrocement technology.  Various local NGOs have agreed to observe construction as a possible means of future implementation should the demand be there.  </p>

</div></div>","Dear friends,
We are a group of students from the College of William and Mary, and we are working to raise funds to assist a Peace Corp volunteer by the name of Ryan Browning in installing water storage tanks for the community of Agua de Luis, Dominican Republic. This storage tank can hold up to 10,000 liters of rainwater for families without access to clean water. Every dollar donated will go directly to buy materials, not to any administrative or overhead costs. All project labor will be donated by members of the community. Citizens of Agua de Luis have been working to raise their promised portion of the investment, and we are now trying to help Mr. Browning raise the remaining $3000 necessary to complete the project. Furthermore, we want to use kickstarter to fund $500 for a part of $3000 we want to raise, which is almost one water tank for one family. As we will be visiting this community, we would love to be able to bring a donation with us to help accomplish this wonderful project.

However, the ""Pin"" and ""Sign Sponsors"" perks will not be paid out as they can only exist upon completion of the course renovation. In other words, we can't put baskets up until we have all 18 ready to install, so your money will be held in the fund along with all of your information for use when the installations are completed.

Any funding past our goal will be put in the park's official account used for upkeep and course maintenance. While $1,000 a hole seems steep, we have to factor in other costs such as all the merchandise, Indiegogo's 5% cut, as well as 5% which we have agreed to pay to Johnson Park for various fees.   
 Any contribution to the cause is going to be a huge help. Even if it is only $1. But if you can give more, we have awesome donation size based prize tiers that include Mini Markers, getting your name placed on a donor board, Sweatshirts, Hats, Discs and if you’re really interested, we can name a hole after you or your business.






We at GRDGU are confident that by starting this campaign, the only risks would be slight time delays. We have invested many hours and have had conversations with the great people who run the Kent County Parks Department and the people in charge of Johnson Park specifically. We have been assured that the project is green-lit and all we have to do at this point is raise the necessary money to get it done.   


Basket Prices -
Baskets: $400.00 x 18 = $7200.00
Locking Collar Assembly: $15.00 x 18 = $270.00
Anchor Assembly: $25.00 x 18 = $450.00
Concrete (Approx. 1 cu.ft. Per. hole): $4.00 x 18 = $72.00

Obstacles for course (elevated basket):  $480
Equipment Rental for Installation:  $390 ($195 daily)
Total: $1760
Merchandise for Indiegogo Perks - $1454
5% percent donated to Johnson Park - $900 (if $18,000 is raised)
5% percent fee for indiegogo- $900 (if $18,000 is raised)
TOTAL ESTIMATED COSTS: $18,006.00



If the goal isn't met, the amount of money raised will be donated to the already existing Johnson Park Disc Golf Fund. Our backers will still receive the merchandise perks that they qualify for. However, the ""Pin"" and ""Sign Sponsors"" perks will not be paid out as they can only exist upon completion of the course renovation. In other words, we can't put baskets up until we have all 18 ready to install, so your money will be held in the fund along with all of your information for use when the installations are completed. Also, a new campaign will begin until we meet our goal and we will continue to campaign for this until it is funded 100%.


If you can't help financially, don’t worry. We’re eternally grateful if you can give even just one dollar. Seriously, something as small as one dollar can make a great difference to this project. However, we do understand not everyone can give money. That is okay. If you can’t help by donating money, tell your friends. Share this on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or any other social media. If you don’t participate in social media, tell your friends about the project. The more people who know about this, the better, and word of mouth goes a long way in our community.Thank you for reading, sharing, donating and your overall support.Sincerely,All of the members of GRDGU,Brandon Braisted, Scott Stacey, Alex Schackow, Chadwick Smith and Cory Whitten GRDGU and Project Johnson Directors",10.0,0,"1 Campaign

</p><p>Dear All, </p>
<p>My name is Wekem Raymond Avatim. I am 38 years old. I am from Ghana, West Africa. I am in the USA for 4 months thanks to a US State
Department funded exchange program. I work with ECO City Farms learning
sustainable agricultural to take back home to help rural farmers to

and plan to return home at the end of November. </p>
<p>About one month ago, I received the painful news that my 20 year-old
brother, Kwotuo Avatim, was thrown from a motorbike while on an errand. Roads
in rural Ghana are notoriously in poor shape with lots of large potholes. It was
one such pothole that caught the wheel of the bike on which he was riding and
my brother was badly injured. I am told the accident has impacted his spine with
multiple fractures.  He is now paralyzed
from the waist down and has been hospitalized for close to 4 weeks.  Since the accident, Kwotuo has experienced no
relief from his suffering. The care he received has been minimal.  Just recently, he was transferred by car
almost 400 miles to the country’s second biggest hospital, the Komfo Anokye
Teaching Hospital. </p>
<p>Since the accident, Kwotuo has been unable to urinate or defecate
due to his paralysis. He has not been administered medicine. The doctors now give us two options. Either we:</p>
<p>(1)<span>  </span>pay a minimum of $3,000 US dollars to cover only the cost of operating on him immediately,
or </p>
<p>(2)<span>  </span>have him
discharged as is.  </p>
<p>The required $3,000 does not include expenses related to his hospitalization and
medication.  There is no health insurance
policy that covers these expenses.  I have been the head of my family since my dad passed away 2 years ago. My family
is unable to meet these costs and are looking to me to provide the
support. However, I cannot afford this much money.</p>
<p>The doctors state that my brother Kwotuo has a 50-50 chance of being
able to walk again after the operation, but that at least he will be able to
perform basic bodily functions. I am seeking support from you to enable my
family meet the cost of his operation that will at least enable him to recover
sufficiently to be able to freely urinate, go to toilet and sit up. My family
and I are grateful for any support you can offer.</p>

When you feel this vibration you respond by making a subtle movement with your finger. This tells Thim you are awake. When you fail to respond, Thim knows you've fallen asleep. This method of tracking sleep onset (time taken to fall asleep) is proven to be as accurate as the equipment you would find in a sleep lab. And is much more accurate than popular sleep tracking devices which rely on actigraphy alone. </p><p>One popular sleep-tracking wristband was cited for misjudging sleep onset (the beginning of stage 1 sleep) by 15 minutes; with such inaccuracy the current crop of wearable devices are simply unable to facilitate <strong>sleep re-training</strong>.

Open the Thim App in your smart phone and set an alarm window before you go to bed. For example, if you need to wake up by 8:00am, you might like to set an alarm window of 7:30 – 8:00am.

</div><p>Poor sleep leaves you feeling tired and lethargic. This can impact your relationships with friends and family, as well as career success. It is unfortunate that so many in our community are unable to live the life they aspire to because of an inability to fall asleep and stay asleep. </p><p>Professor Lack and his colleagues went in search of a new way to improve sleep. One which would be simple and effective. Their research showed that sleep re-training can reduce time taken to fall asleep by 30 minutes and increase time asleep by almost 70 minutes (Harris et al, 2007 &amp; 2012).</p><p>But despite these breakthrough findings, sleep re-training was only used by experts. Expensive lab equipment was needed to pin point the moment someone would fall asleep to begin counting down from 3-minutes. This made sleep re-training too expensive. Popular sleep tracking devices were inexpensive, but inaccurate.</p><p>The researchers compared the accuracy of sleep lab equipment to someone physically responding to a tone. They found that a tone was accurate for determining when you enter Stage 1 of your sleep cycle. This finding allowed our team to work with Professor Lack to design a new wearable device for sleep. </p><p>“… sleep re-training is expensive.

It’s this process of falling asleep and then waking which conditions you to sleep better – as demonstrated in two University trials. In the morning , most users do not remember being woken. This is because drifting between the earliest stages of the sleep cycle are subtle.These naps are delivered during the first stage of your sleep cycle – typically the first hour of bedtime. After this, you’re able to enjoy a long nights rest.This conditioning program is a simple technique used by sleep clinics for over 10 years. Our team worked with Professor Leon Lack to imbed this program into a wearable device which you can use in your own home. Sleep tracking Thim detects the onset of sleep to the nearest minute. No other wearable device comes close. The world first application of sleep re-training demands accuracy. Thim delivers. Thim emits a soft vibration each minute. When you feel this vibration you respond by making a subtle movement with your finger. This tells Thim you are awake. When you fail to respond, Thim knows you've fallen asleep. This method of tracking sleep onset (time taken to fall asleep) is proven to be as accurate as the equipment you would find in a sleep lab. And is much more accurate than popular sleep tracking devices which rely on actigraphy alone. One popular sleep-tracking wristband was cited for misjudging sleep onset (the beginning of stage 1 sleep) by 15 minutes; with such inaccuracy the current crop of wearable devices are simply unable to facilitate sleep re-training. These applications demand to-the-minute accuracy. Thim delivers. Beautiful design   We've blended the latest in sleep science with organic design. We wanted this technology to represent the ability to disconnect and dream. Thims incredible design includes:
100% silicone band for those with sensitive skin
4X bands so you can select the perfect fit
Premium polycarbonate housing 
 Your sleep dashboard  Thim connects to your smart phone via Bluetooth low energy technology. This allows you to program your device. It also allows your sleep data to be transferred from your device to your smart phone in real time. Specifically, your dashboard will show: 
Sleep onset latency (time taken to fall asleep each night) 
Stages of sleep and their duration 
Frequency and duration of waking episodes 
The Thim App calculates your sleep score so you can track your progress. You can also share you raw sleep data with your health care professional. The Thim App will be available free of charge.  Smart alarmWaking up in the morning during a light sleep stage is a more pleasant experience than waking from a deep sleep stage. When Thim senses you’ve entered a light stage of sleep – Thim will wake you up. Here's how your new Smart Alarm feature will work. Open the Thim App in your smart phone and set an alarm window before you go to bed. For example, if you need to wake up by 8:00am, you might like to set an alarm window of 7:30 – 8:00am. If you are in a light stage of sleep at 7:30am, Thim will wake you up. If however, you enter a light stage of sleep at 7:55am – Thim will only wake you then.The Smart Alarm can be used in conjunction with the Sleep Re-training feature. That is, you may undertake 1-hour of sleep re-training between 10pm and 11pm, and then use your Smart Alarm in the morning to wake up.  everyone is talking about Thim...  Features   From scientific research which started in 2007

 
Poor sleep leaves you feeling tired and lethargic. This can impact your relationships with friends and family, as well as career success. It is unfortunate that so many in our community are unable to live the life they aspire to because of an inability to fall asleep and stay asleep. Professor Lack and his colleagues went in search of a new way to improve sleep. One which would be simple and effective. Their research showed that sleep re-training can reduce time taken to fall asleep by 30 minutes and increase time asleep by almost 70 minutes (Harris et al, 2007 & 2012).But despite these breakthrough findings, sleep re-training was only used by experts. Expensive lab equipment was needed to pin point the moment someone would fall asleep to begin counting down from 3-minutes. This made sleep re-training too expensive. Popular sleep tracking devices were inexpensive, but inaccurate.The researchers compared the accuracy of sleep lab equipment to someone physically responding to a tone. They found that a tone was accurate for determining when you enter Stage 1 of your sleep cycle. This finding allowed our team to work with Professor Lack to design a new wearable device for sleep. “… sleep re-training is expensive. Many people who need it can’t afford it...Let’s hope this Australian study stimulates the creation of such home (sleep re-training) programs.”  Harvard Health (Skerrett, 2012) Our previous work Professor Lack has been our a friend and collaborator for a long time. In 2012 we worked together in designing the Re-Timer light therapy glasses. Re-Timer has received worldwide acclaim and been featured by many major news outlets.“I think they are a break through... I’m a huge fan” - Dave Asprey, Bulletproof founder & New York Times bestselling author Your teamWe're a balanced team who love bringing the latest in sleep science to the community. We did it in 2012. Now we're back to do it again.  The journey 

 
All too often advancements in science are left in the lab. Not this time. This is a chance for pioneering research to make its way into the hands of the community.What better place to seek support than through a community based platform. It’s up to the people. You can help us ensure this breakthrough does not remain hidden inside scientific journals forever. Thank you for your support.Leon, Vera & Ben.",20.0,2,"1 Campaign

<br/>We have designed and prototyped 3 versions of Diabeto and recently, we also shipped two batches of Diabetos <b>(We had received 223 applications from 22 countries)</b> which were compatible with iOS applications. Partly, the alpha testing was assisted by University College London, UK and <a href=""http://www.chi-med.ac.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ChiMed</a>. The testers helped us with bug testing and reporting and gave us valuable feedback on Diabeto iOS application.

<p>In late 2012, we had received $30,000 from a private angel investor and $40,000 grant from the government of Chile as a part of Start Up Chile program. Team Diabeto has bootstrapped and invested the rest of the money from individual savings and bank loan. We plan to use the Indiegogo money in the following way,<br/></p>
<p></p>

<br/>And when we reach our goal, our biggest inspiration, Diabeto Rockstar would be super happy and hence we have included his smiley pic in the infographic to support him and make Diabeto a reality! <br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/976703/files/20141101051050-grey_line.png?1414843850"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1073422/files/20141205063705-risks_and_challenges.jpg?1417790225"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We have been researching, prototyping, testing and repeating the entire process since 2.5 years. We have been even backed by the Government of Chile. We owe a lot of our success to them. Yes, medical device research takes time since we have the responsibility to deliver a quality product which is subject to research, testing and certification. <br/></p>
<p>The following are the challenges which we would be facing in the near future, <br/></p>
<p><b>1. Regulatory challenges:</b></p>
<p>We already have carried out testing and have obtained CE certification 
for the hardware device and we can legally sell in Europe, UK, parts of 
Africa and Asia.<br/></p>
<p>The product has received Class 1 certification for CE and we are fully aware that we need to file for FDA 510(k) pre-market notification in order to sell Diabeto to USA. However, we already have identified regulatory experts who can help us with the filing. Moreover, we have a few hospitals who are ready to help us with the accessibility testing, the data of which would be submitted to the FDA. Aqnd also not to forget, we are going to file the 510(k) pre-marketing notification with your help (Do take part in the study if you are in USA, without signing the consent form, we cannot ship Diabeto to you).</p>
<p><b>2. Manufacturing challenges: </b></p>
<p>We have launched the Indiegogo campaign in order to enter into the manufacturing phase. The manufacturing would involve creating molds and tooling to manufacture Diabeto casing and different parts. This process is complicated and hence there might be a delay in the manufacturing process. We are completely aware of this process and situation and hence we have been taking various steps to mitigate this delay and delay risk by following ways,</p>
<p>1. Adopting Total quality management techniques (TQM processes) and Lean manufacturing processes. <br/></p>
<p>2. We have already identified the manufacturing partners which are locally accessible to our entire team. Thus, we would personally inspect the whole manufacturing process and also make sure that the testing and quality check is carried out in our presence. </p>
<p>We are here to provide a quality product in your hands and our main goal would be your 100% satisfaction. So if there are speed breakers in the delivery process, we would make sure to mitigate the errors/delay and deliver a quality product in your hand in the given time schedule.</p>

Diabeto is a complete diabetes management system which consists of a non-intrusive bluetooth powered accessible hardware device that enables the transfer of blood glucose readings from your Glucometer into a smartphone. These readings are then stored securely on a cloud server for easy access to your data, anywhere, anytime! 
Your can access this data on smartphone application (Diabeto mobile application), website application and also on pebble watch. 






Diabeto System
Diabeto is a combination of,
1. Diabeto hardware which transmits readings from the Glucometer into smartphone.*
2. A smartphone application which gives detailed trends and insights about your Diabetes. These readings are securely pushed onto a secure cloud server.
3. A web application/interface which pulls the readings from the cloud server and give detailed insights similar to the Diabeto application. The web application is useful for remote monitoring by parents and healthcare practitioners.
4. A pebble watch display for remote monitoring The readings are pulled from the Diabeto cloud server thus making your data easily accessible from anywhere. 
* In case of Accuchek Glucometer users, one needs to buy another hardware Infra red jacket called Diabeto IR Jacket


Easy 
Using Diabeto is super easy! After taking your blood glucose reading from your Glucometer. Switch on your Diabeto using the power button. Plug it in the Glucometer, start the Diabeto application and voila, the readings are synced wirelessly from the Glucometer into your smartphone. 
What's more, it has a smaller footprint and a beautifully thought ergonomic design and can be easily carried around with you in your pocket or Glucometer pouch. 







Beautiful
Design is as important as technology to us! Rather, its usable, functional design which is appealing to every age group was the top priority. That's what we came up with (And this is not just an idea, below are the actual images of the alpha testing prototypes which were shipped to alpha testers across the world)






Simple
Diabeto system comes with a free mobile application which gives you deep insights on your data. Diabeto application is the heart of the Diabeto system.





We have designed the Diabeto application keeping the UX and UI elements to be simple and yet intuitive for children as well as senior citizens. With the application, you can track, your mood, food, medication (Insulin intake), physical activity and relate it to your blood glucose levels which are transferred automatically from the Diabeto hardware. 
Diabeto application automatically plots beautiful graphs which would give you an idea on your trends over the week, month, year. Also you can select custom dates and generate PDF reports which you can email to your healthcare practitioner for his opinion.


We have alpha tested the iOS application and You can use the iOS application even without the Diabeto hardware and yes, its completely free. Our team is working hard on the Android application and we are actually coding it as you read this sentence! Diabeto would be compatible with iOS and Android.The mobile application pushes the readings to a secure cloud server which are then accessed securely with an easy to understand web application. The web application gives insights on Glucose trends over a period of time along with other parameters captured in the mobile application. 




Moreover, one can access readings from the application and cloud server directly onto a pebble smart watch. This is extremely useful for remotely monitoring children's diabetes by parents or healthcare practitioner.
Secure


Diabeto cloud storage backend uses industry standard SSL technology to encrypt and secure Diabeto's data. Moreover, the data is encrypted before being stored at backend cloud server. In addition to the cloud security, here are some salient features about the system (In accordance to HIPAA compliance),1. Secure access to Diabeto data on mobile phones via unique user identification.
2. Encryption of all the data which is stored on mobile devices as well as cloud server. The Diabeto hardware birdie is just a transmission device and no data whatsoever is stored on the hardware device.


Diabeto IR adapter
For awesome people using Accuchek range of Glucometers, we have designed another cool piece of hardware to transmit the readings from the Glucometer via Infra Red protocol. The Diabeto IR adapter plugs into Diabeto birdie device and then transmits the readings wirelessly to the Diabeto mobile application.





 

Currently, we are compatible with 25 Glucometers which are popularly available all over the world. However, trust us, we are working on making your favorite Glucometer compatible with Diabeto. If you have question about Glucometer compatibility, do not hesitate in getting in touch with us. Here is the list of the compatible Glucometers.









Diabetes doesn't discriminate and hence we have studied the accessibility and tried to make Diabeto hardware accessible so that it can be used easily by,
1. People with visual impairment.
2. People with hearing impairment.
3. Children (With Type  1 Diabetes).
4. Senior citizens.


We were learning accessibility with the help of our friends at Barrierbreak, the leading firm for accessibility testing in India.  The awesome folks at Barrierbreak did a detailed review of the hardware and suggested us changes to make it more accessible and we have finished incorporating 90% of those changes in the Diabeto birdie. You can check the video featuring Priti Rohra, Head of Accessibility at Barrierbreak here,The hardware accessibility would include the hardware plus the packaging. We would be working on software mobile accessibility and web application.











We have been helped and benefited tremendously by the open source 
community. We wanna do our bit and give back and hence have decided to 
make Diabeto hardware open source which means the schematic, design 
files and bill of materials would be open source. You can download the 
files right now in here.







Developers? We are not leaving you behind...
You guys have a kickass mobile application but...you want to integrate accurate readings from Glucometer into your application, Worry not, we are also working on Diabeto API so that you can integrate readings from Diabeto hardware onto your awesome mobile application. For Electronic Health/Medical Record (EHR/EMR) companies, hospitals and institutions which want to use Diabeto in remote settings or in your organizations, Diabeto API is going to do wonders. 

We have been researching on Diabeto since 2.5 years. Since then we have been sketching, prototyping, hacking hardware, 3d printing and trying to write code on a daily basis. Yes, even on weekends! (Well, almost every weekend)

We have designed and prototyped 3 versions of Diabeto and recently, we also shipped two batches of Diabetos (We had received 223 applications from 22 countries) which were compatible with iOS applications. Partly, the alpha testing was assisted by University College London, UK and ChiMed. The testers helped us with bug testing and reporting and gave us valuable feedback on Diabeto iOS application. This is the final 3d file of Diabeto prototype casing hardware which was shipped to alpha testers. 
And here is the final prototype packaging with prototype quick start guide and prototype manual and of course the actual Diabeto prototype hardware.

And here is an alpha testing video of the iOS demonstration. All credit goes to our awesome friend Erin Little who heads a not for profit organization Sucre Blue which is dedicated to provide affordable medical care to people living with Diabetes in India.


We already have received CE (Class 1a device) certification for Diabeto but to be able to bring Diabeto in USA, we need to file for a FDA (Food and Drug Administration) 510(k) premarket notification and that's where you come in the picture. If you live in the United States and pledge for Diabeto, you will be eligible to take part in the research study and give feedback about Diabeto. This research study will happen in the framework of clinical studies. You will receive an invite for the clinical study and would be eligible for the same ONLY IF YOU OPT-IN. For each study, you will be contacted and you will have to sign a informed consent form. The first steps for the research study would involve the following,1. We would send you information about the study and informed consent form.2. After you review the information and only if you sign the informed consent form, you will be eligible to take part in the research study and ONLY then you will receive Diabeto hardware device from us. 
Timeline







Technical Specifications











There are more than 346 million people living with Diabetes and unfortunately even our parents are living with Diabetes. We started working on Diabeto to make the lives of our parents better. We are a mix of passionate geeks with varied experience ranging from pharmacy, management, coding and scaling previous startups.
Remember, yousendit.com? (Now Hightail) Amir was the co-founder of yousendit.com and Shreekant was the 5th employee at yousendit.com while Hemanshu has successfully heading marketing at a ticketing startup in India. We have experience in creating and scaling startups and have come together to fight for a common cause - Diabetes!






































In late 2012, we had received $30,000 from a private angel investor and $40,000 grant from the government of Chile as a part of Start Up Chile program. Team Diabeto has bootstrapped and invested the rest of the money from individual savings and bank loan. We plan to use the Indiegogo money in the following way,


And when we reach our goal, our biggest inspiration, Diabeto Rockstar would be super happy and hence we have included his smiley pic in the infographic to support him and make Diabeto a reality! 
We have been researching, prototyping, testing and repeating the entire process since 2.5 years. We have been even backed by the Government of Chile. We owe a lot of our success to them. Yes, medical device research takes time since we have the responsibility to deliver a quality product which is subject to research, testing and certification. 
The following are the challenges which we would be facing in the near future, 
1. Regulatory challenges:
We already have carried out testing and have obtained CE certification 
for the hardware device and we can legally sell in Europe, UK, parts of 
Africa and Asia.
The product has received Class 1 certification for CE and we are fully aware that we need to file for FDA 510(k) pre-market notification in order to sell Diabeto to USA. However, we already have identified regulatory experts who can help us with the filing. Moreover, we have a few hospitals who are ready to help us with the accessibility testing, the data of which would be submitted to the FDA. Aqnd also not to forget, we are going to file the 510(k) pre-marketing notification with your help (Do take part in the study if you are in USA, without signing the consent form, we cannot ship Diabeto to you).
2. Manufacturing challenges: 
We have launched the Indiegogo campaign in order to enter into the manufacturing phase. The manufacturing would involve creating molds and tooling to manufacture Diabeto casing and different parts. This process is complicated and hence there might be a delay in the manufacturing process. We are completely aware of this process and situation and hence we have been taking various steps to mitigate this delay and delay risk by following ways,
1. Adopting Total quality management techniques (TQM processes) and Lean manufacturing processes. 
2. We have already identified the manufacturing partners which are locally accessible to our entire team. Thus, we would personally inspect the whole manufacturing process and also make sure that the testing and quality check is carried out in our presence. 
We are here to provide a quality product in your hands and our main goal would be your 100% satisfaction. So if there are speed breakers in the delivery process, we would make sure to mitigate the errors/delay and deliver a quality product in your hand in the given time schedule.

<p>Hi my name
is Linda Frenzel- I am 51 and been blessed with good health my entire life. Although
now I have had a bad year with my health- I began the change-(you know the
dredged female change) while I was on my 3<sup>rd</sup> mission/volunteering in
Moshi Tanzania.<span>  I had no idea what was
happening to my body- but it was gross, painful and I thought I was losing my
mind.  I was not blessed with children. I
was married for over 16 years and my husband and I tried everything to no
avail. Unfortunately- we got divorced in 2006 after almost 20 years of a
wonderful life-marriage together. In 2012 I began volunteering as a teacher in
the villages below Mt. Kilimanjaro Tanzania– and it changed my life.  I sold and donated all my materialist items
to return in April 2014. I am extremely passionate about the students, teaching
ESL (English as a Second Language) the community and their love. </span></p>
<p>Around mid
Aug. 2014 I began to get sicker and sicker- As time progressed I started seeing
Doctors there – in (Moshi)- they advised many different remedies-medication and
such to no avail. As you can imagine OB/GYN are not used and/or available in this
small town. After finding a Doctor I saw an OB/GYN 2 times then he insisted I
go to Dar Es Salam, and I was fortunate enough to make it to a hospital in Dar
Es Salam- (largest city in Tanzania) about Jan. 12, 2015 and there with
sonograms they found my uterus to be 3-4 times the size it should be
(endometriosis) . As well as my uterus was covered and wrapped in
fibroids.<span>  This was in Jan. 2015 I had to
return to the states. Between Insurance- having to find work to live and moving
to Toledo with a friend that would take me in to care for me and help me get
through all the Doctors, testing, procedures, a home to live in and care for
me. I of course had to find work.  And I
did, with in just 3 weeks of being here in Toledo.  It is not a great job, it is long long hours
for little pay. But it is a job…The Biggest problem--- is I started my job
April 24, 2015- and it has no insurance (which I have on my own and pay the
monthly premium ) I am asking for help for co-pays (the medical-hospitals for 4
surgeries- hospital (St. Luke’s)- the co-pays are getting to be over - 7
thousand and the bills from the Doctors, hospitals- Doctors after care have
left me flat broke- worse I am know having this sweet women pay for me.</span></p>
<p>I need to be
able to feed myself- co pays, meds, and help out with rent- my friend has gone
beyond the call of duty for any friend--- she gave me her room cause it has an
upstairs bathroom, and helps in so many ways.<span> 
I AM SO THANKFULL TO HER.  I know
how blessed I am this women has taken me in and cares for me.</span></p>
<p>I am not a
big computer, internet, social media (I am not on any social media groups)- but
my friends grandson told me about this site so I thought I would try and
see.<span>  I am reachable </span><a href=""mailto:linda_frenzel@yahoo.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>linda_frenzel@yahoo.com</u></a> and can be googled to see that I am a real person!!<span>  All I can say is thank you for taking the
time to read my story.  I am painfully
aware there are many others that need help more than me. But desperate times---
call for desperate measures.  I am not
medically able, nor allowed through my Doctors to return to work till maybe
around Aug. 17<sup>th</sup>, but I will never make enough money to pay for my
medical bills, medicine or myself for months. </span></p>

Camp Metabolic is run by Accessible Lifestyles Unlimited, a 501(c)(3) non-profit dedicated to creating programs to allow those after paralyzing illness or injury to enjoy the best in active fun and pursue fitness goals. Camp is a place where anyone after a paralyzing injury or illness can come and live the dream, an active lifestyle. We rent an Easter Seals camp in Boulder Creek, CA., where we bring the best of adapted activities to a beautiful setting amongst the California Redwoods. 
We have cycling, kayaking, scuba diving, tennis, basketball, weight lifting, sailing, an FES cyle, dancing, and everyone's favorite, YOGA!!! Yes, even the macho guys like it; ask Mark Wellman, the first guy to climb the peaks in Yosemite as a para- he loves it. AND he brings his climbing wall for the most excellent fun. We also have delicious, nutritious food and we make it easy to count your calories.

We enjoy the music of live singers/songwriters by the fireside, as well as fun in nearby Santa Cruz.
We have done this for the past three years (2010, '11, and '12) but didn't have the money to pull it off in 2013. We are looking in this initial campaign to find our down payment to Easter Seals due in December. 
We are open to ANYONE with a paralyzing injury or illness attending, and we would LOVE to get the word out. The only requirement is that they get their doctors permission to attend Camp Metabolic, and that  they bring everything they need to take care of themselves for 8-9 days,.

<p>Victims of human sex trafficking experience severe physical and psychological trauma as a result of violence, rape, threats, addictions, and other means traffickers use to control their victims.  Survivors experience inability to express feelings, poor communication skills, inability to make friends, fear of adults/strangers, drug addiction, nightmares, flashbacks, depression and suicidal ideation.  Survivors may experience inability to dream and hope for the future, as they struggle to form an identity outside of as a sexual object.<br/></p>

<p>I received my MSW from the University of Denver Graduate School of Social Work, and am licensed in the state of Colorado.  I am a certified Trauma Release Exercises (TRE) Practitioner as well, and I am hoping to share this self-administered, self-regulated technique to release tension and trauma from the body and reduce symptoms of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.  For more information on TRE: <a href=""http://www.traumaprevention.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.traumaprevention.com</a></p>

</div><p>Welcome!  Do you love the Lord?  Do you play golf?  Do you know anyone else who does?  If so, then you've come to the right place!</p><div>
My name is Darrell Link (my friends call me ""Link"").  I'm the Inventor of the patented <strong>Cross Brush™</strong>, a golf club cleaning tool designed to:</div><ul>
<li>Honor Christ</li>
<li>Hang from Your Golf Bag and</li>
<li>Improve Your Game</li>
</ul><div>
I created this project because I'd like your help taking this product from just a simple <em>dream</em> to a full reality that ultimately helps build God's kingdom.  I'm not a pastor or a deacon.  But I love the Lord; I've always wanted to be an entrepreneur &amp; philanthropist; and I desire to do good things in the community.</div><div>This project isn't about me, though.  This new start-up exists for people who love Christ, love golf, and are excited about expressing their faith while playing the game they love.  To be more specific, our goal is to provide quality cross-shaped brushes that specifically benefit and inspire Christian golfers.  The Cross Brush actually helps you strike golf balls better, too!  Also, 10% of all proceeds will benefit faith-based initiatives such as the Fellowship of Christian Athletes (FCA)!</div><div> </div> <div> <h3></h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434939216/d5ssow2sg3km6pphr8yf.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 219.75px; height: 293px;""/></p>
<br/>
<h3>What's Needed &amp; What You Get In Return</h3> <p>The funding goal is $5K, and every penny will be used to support this project.  </p>
<p>If you’re an avid golfer, a beginner, even a family member or friend of a golfer, I invite you to grow with what I refer to as 'The Cross Brush Concept.'  Your contributions will directly support future product development, professional website design, additional patents &amp; trademarks, and tradeshow displays.</p>
<p>More importantly, you--or that special golfer in your life--will be inspired and empowered to spread God's word on the driving range, on the golf course, and at the clubhouse.  Simply latching/displaying your Cross Brush on your golf bag as a reminder of God's goodness is an option, too. </p>
<p> <strong>The Impact</strong></p>
</div><div>Here's one example of how The Cross Brush can have a BIG impact. Imagine this:
<p>A golfer completes a round of golf, returns to the clubhouse, and places his/her golf bag upright on the ground before heading to the 19th hole (usually a restaurant &amp; bar at the golf course).  As the golfer does this, a person nearby notices something very unique about the golfer's bag (hanging from the golfer's bag is a cross-shaped brush that clearly honors Jesus Christ).  The two people engage in a conversation about the cross and its significance in the golfer's life.  By the end of the discussion the other person (maybe a golfer, maybe not) accepts Christ as his/her personal Savior.</p>
<p>Additionally, maintaining clean golf clubs—or “irons” as many clubs are called—is absolutely essential to every golfer’s success on the course.  Why?  Because clean grooves lead to much purer ball-striking, which usually translates into much lower scores; and that’s something every golfer wants. <br/></p>
<p></p>

</strong><p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p> <p>This is a relatively new work in progress; that in and of itself is a challenge. However, I truly believe the unwavering faith, products, planning, and level of commitment that have gone into this project will produce something favorable in God's eyes.</p>

Welcome!  Do you love the Lord?  Do you play golf?  Do you know anyone else who does?  If so, then you've come to the right place!
My name is Darrell Link (my friends call me ""Link"").  I'm the Inventor of the patented Cross Brush™, a golf club cleaning tool designed to:
Honor Christ
Hang from Your Golf Bag and
Improve Your Game

I created this project because I'd like your help taking this product from just a simple dream to a full reality that ultimately helps build God's kingdom.  I'm not a pastor or a deacon.  But I love the Lord; I've always wanted to be an entrepreneur & philanthropist; and I desire to do good things in the community.This project isn't about me, though.  This new start-up exists for people who love Christ, love golf, and are excited about expressing their faith while playing the game they love.  To be more specific, our goal is to provide quality cross-shaped brushes that specifically benefit and inspire Christian golfers.  The Cross Brush actually helps you strike golf balls better, too!  Also, 10% of all proceeds will benefit faith-based initiatives such as the Fellowship of Christian Athletes (FCA)!   


What's Needed & What You Get In Return The funding goal is $5K, and every penny will be used to support this project.  
If you’re an avid golfer, a beginner, even a family member or friend of a golfer, I invite you to grow with what I refer to as 'The Cross Brush Concept.'  Your contributions will directly support future product development, professional website design, additional patents & trademarks, and tradeshow displays.
More importantly, you--or that special golfer in your life--will be inspired and empowered to spread God's word on the driving range, on the golf course, and at the clubhouse.  Simply latching/displaying your Cross Brush on your golf bag as a reminder of God's goodness is an option, too. 
 The Impact
Here's one example of how The Cross Brush can have a BIG impact. Imagine this:
A golfer completes a round of golf, returns to the clubhouse, and places his/her golf bag upright on the ground before heading to the 19th hole (usually a restaurant & bar at the golf course).  As the golfer does this, a person nearby notices something very unique about the golfer's bag (hanging from the golfer's bag is a cross-shaped brush that clearly honors Jesus Christ).  The two people engage in a conversation about the cross and its significance in the golfer's life.  By the end of the discussion the other person (maybe a golfer, maybe not) accepts Christ as his/her personal Savior.
Additionally, maintaining clean golf clubs—or “irons” as many clubs are called—is absolutely essential to every golfer’s success on the course.  Why?  Because clean grooves lead to much purer ball-striking, which usually translates into much lower scores; and that’s something every golfer wants. 


   

Risks & Challenges This is a relatively new work in progress; that in and of itself is a challenge. However, I truly believe the unwavering faith, products, planning, and level of commitment that have gone into this project will produce something favorable in God's eyes.
Other Ways You Can Help

As obvious as this sounds, comfortable positions eventually cause a threat to our spinal health. If you’re currently experiencing backache, shoulder discomfort, a stiff neck or fatigue with unknown causes, it is highly likely they are due to poor posture.The pressure put on the back from a slouched posture amounts up to a maximum of 600lbs. Because the weight is not dispersed to the spine evenly, The surrounding muscles become even more cramped up and stiff. Bad posture sets in, it’s hard to return to the original state.So Master Fit created Balancenap,a product that helps you get over all those hurdles.  The body is made of a chain structure where everything is connected to each other and is in harmony through cooperation with stability and mobility.If there is a problem in one spot, there is already a problem with the body’s balance, so overall management is very important rather than spot treatment.Balancenap is a  total whole-body healthcare tool combining the features of body correction as well as massage and exercise done through the hands of a professional.Balancenap is a total whole-body care correction tool created for office workers who stand or sit for a long time and for people who routinely feel backaches, shoulder discomfort, stiff neck, etc. even while being completely still.It can be used easily in the desired area by anyone and straightens the spine through simple movements. It will help blood circulation in the neck, waist, back, pelvis, and more to restore normal angles through consistent use and will train core muscles that are in charge of key functions in our bodies. Starex evermoin ABS and ABF-0200HF, which are safe materials used in Balancenap, maintain excellent antibacterial properties even in various living environments, having an antibacterial growth rate of 99.9% or more and an excellent antifungal ability, so they can be applied to various household products to maintain top hygiene.In addition, the Starex evermoin ABS, ABF-0200HF adds excellent weather resistance and UV stability, allowing the product to be used as new, with little physical degradation and color change over time. In addition, with strict international safety certification for food, health care, and toxicity, Evermoin is an antibacterial solution that can be applied on a wide variety of everyday items that require clean and safe materials.

 
The ideal angle is 30-35 degrees for neck, 40 degrees for back, and 45 degrees for waist. Just by putting Balancenap on an uncomfortable part and lying on it, it will facilitate the flow of fluid through a normal spinal angle and reduce nerve compression.Simply by rolling left and right in the lying position you will relax the muscles that have been knotted for some time and improve core muscle function, as Balancenap is a piece of specialized equipment developed by a team of sports medicine doctors to help you maintain a healthy body without the yo-yo effect of re-clumping muscles. Balancenap has superior features and functionality compared to similar product groups.For example, a Foam Roller has various uses in massage, stretching, and exercise, but as it can overstrain the wrist and neck, there’s a high risk of getting secondary injury if you fail to keep balance.Similarly, Ballance makes it hard for you to maintain balance and the bumps embedded in too deep may cause injuries.Moreover, other similar product groups have distinct uses for a single body part such as the neck, spine, waist or pelvis, which decreases usability and creates an economic burden to purchase many products for whole-body care.To provide reasonable features and performance, Balancenap was planned with the concept of total whole-body care from the very beginning of the research and development process, and has been made into an all-in-one item that can be used for all purposes, including massage, stretching, exercise, and body correction, in the easiest way possible.   *  In some regions, additional customs fee may be charged during delivery.

Please take care in reading.</em></p><p>My wife and I started with one of those picture-perfect stories: met by happenstance on the internet to fall in love, young, energetic people out to conquer life excitedly with their college education and the will of God. Started the family, bought the house, pounded down debt, and started saving up for a rainy day. We had no idea that a rainy day could last so long.</p><p>When we decided to have our youngest child, Rowan, it was a long struggle. We tried and tried to have a little sibling for our fun and energetic son Ryland, but things weren't working out. It was recommended that we either use medical assistance to get pregnant or officially end the capability for pregnancy for the health of my wife when we suddenly learned that she was pregnant. The pregnancy itself was a blessing and went by without any issues, except for the fact that an ovarian cyst was growing along with my son. In early May, our ten-pound baby was to be delivered, and an almost ten-pound cyst was present as well.  Our bouncing baby boy was born completely healthy though.  </p><p>When the doctors did the c-section to bring our son into the world, as well as remove the cyst, the cyst ruptured. I was rushed out of the room with our new boy in my arms so that the doctors could finish taking care of my wife. As I sat there with my little boy, those few hours seemed like days. No doctor was available to tell me if my wife was okay, and I had no idea if the cyst rupture was serious or not. The cyst turned out to be non-harmful after lab testing.  But while I was waiting for her to come out, I snuggled our new boy and prayed he would know his mother. She eventually came out, but it was a scary few hours.</p><p>Our family continued as most would after a birth, learning new methods and getting to know how everyone worked together as a family. Soon, however, my wife Renee began having issues. At three weeks postpartum, she developed her first major fever of 105. She would get sick, get antibiotics, get better, then drop right back down to being sick. After two weeks Renee developed bilateral sciatica and she was unable to move. It became frustratingly repetitive as every time we went to the emergency room, we constantly were told, ""oh, it's just an infection, here's some antibiotics"" to turn around and do it again. As my wife got weaker and things became overwhelming, we took a vacation from my job in Virginia to visit our nearest family in Missouri for a bit of a respite and healing.</p><p>The night we got to Missouri, however, Renee got sick again, this time to the point she had to be admitted to the hospital. They stated that the infection she had was so bad it had gotten into her bloodstream. She was septic with pseudomonas and enterococcus fecalis. She needed immediate IV antibiotics. Our vacation and relaxation immediately turned into juggling our two little boys and supporting my wife, scared out of her mind in the hospital, all alone unless I was able to go.

Halfway through Kentucky, though, she got worse again, and we had to stop. Another emergency room overnight, another ""it's just an infection"", another antibiotic. Another disheartening unknown answer to everything. On the way back into town in Virginia, I had no chance but to drop the kids at the babysitter, drop my wife at the emergency room, and run off to work. I had literally exhausted every other option. </p><p>At the hospital, my wife was being told yet again that she was having an infection, here's some antibiotics. Just a few weeks earlier, she had been told at a clinic that she must be drug seeking to seek medical help so often in a short period of time.  By now it was July, and Renee was fed up and at her wit's end.  She told the doctors she would not leave the hospital until further testing was done on her kidneys, as she felt she had a stone stuck somewhere, or a kidney infection.  They agreed to a CT scan, where they discovered a multitude of kidney stones and a kidney infection! Pregnancy and ovarian cysts can mess with a body, and this one had done a number on her kidneys. She was sent to a kidney specialist that week. The kidney specialist said, ""you know, that infection can effect your heart. You should see a cardiologist just to be safe."" She was referred and visited them one week later. The results came the next morning.  My wife went in for the results and was met with information she never thought she would hear: that she had 48 to 72 hours to live. The infection that we had been fighting for months had infested her heart, eating away at her aortic valve. She had lost most of it, with a broccoli-shaped chunk hanging onto what was left. It was obvious that my wife would need open heart surgery to keep her alive. The big catch was they had put a clock on her life, but they couldn't operate until antibiotics had cleared up her bloodstream, while too much cleaning could cut the stem of the broccoli, letting a giant clot of infection head straight to her brain.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/220828/files/20131124181221-earlyhosp.jpg?1385345541"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p>Renee lost the entire summer of 2011, as she needed to stay in quarantine as she battled this disease. She was laid off due to restructuring the following week from her long-term employment position she had advanced in.  Since she was so ill, she was unable to look for employment and she ended up being under doctor orders for approximately 90 days.  This prevented our ability for her to claim unemployment.  As she was laying in a bed dying, we craved family time, and I was dashing between work, home, and caring for my wife, unsure of the future. My wife and I had a three month emergency fund. We made it last 14 months and several friends and family came along side of us to fill in gaps as they were able, during this battle.  <br/></p><p>Then there was insurance. Her workplace had let her go, and offered a COBRA plan at nearly $800/month. My wife obviously needed insurance right then. When calling around to insurance agencies at the time, ""pre-existing condition"" translated to ""no way we are going to insure you."" My only choice? Insure her at $800/mo on our already halved income since my wife obviously couldn't work, with no additional unemployment income either.</p><p>A summer passes, and Renee makes it home after open-heart surgery. Now, if you remember, it's time to take care of those kidney stones that were found before the heart surgery even started. After a few minor procedures to plan for stone removal procedures, Renee was scheduled to have a tube placed in her kidney through her back, in order to remove a large stone during the main surgery.  However, the doctor deemed that the tube had been placed ""inopportunely."" Translation: they couldn't get anything. An entire surgery (on a woman on blood thinners for life) was useless. We had to wait for her to heal up, bring her home, then wait to start again.</p><p>We didn't make it, though. After a week of healing in the hospital, we returned home. In the middle of the night, Renee called for help from the bathroom, and I find her. The toilet was nearly black with blood. We call an ambulance and she was rushed to the emergency room with a medic on board.  After many hours of frantic unsurity, we find that that tube that had been placed in the wrong area had nicked her renal artery. Blood was flowing through there, dropping into her kidneys, clotting up and forcing out her urethra. She was bleeding to death from the inside, and given 24 to 48 hours to live.</p><p>From the trauma bay in the ER, she was rushed to a local specialist hospital resulting in two overnight emergency surgeries and sixteen blood transfusions.  A coil stent was placed in her renal artery, saving her but permanently killing a quarter of her kidney to stave off the blood flow. Also lost: another couple months of healing, as Coumadin patients sometimes require extra time in the hospital post-op. My wife laments to this day her142 days in the hospital. Although she made some wonderful friends in nurses and medical team members, her boys needed her home. I was being the best Dad I could, but these boys needed their mother. Renee underwent several procedures to have the remaining stones removed surgically.  It was discovered that each of the stones was infected with the bloodstream infection mentioned before, so she remained with a picc line most of this time.  She now has only two stones left on board.  One is so large, it cannot be removed, as it is embedded into her kidney wall.  She was told she would need a transplant to be stone free, but this is not necessary for her survival.  Due to the prolonged exposure to the infection in her bloodstream, she now has a permanently damaged spleen, thus rendering it useless and unable to aid in staving off simple sinus or respiratory infections. This has resulted in additional hospital stays and medication changes.<br/></p><p>I am blessed to have my wife with us. She is a strong, creative, woman and wonderful mother. I would go through all of this a hundred times if it were necessary to keep her in my life. But the resulting firestorm of financial distress has pulled us under. If not for the will of God, the charity of the church, and the friends who came alongside of us, we would be nowhere. They have kept us alive through it all, but our finances only stretch so thin.  <br/></p><p>We had always wanted to move to the Midwest to live near family, however, due to financial issues from these events, it became necessary to leave our home and move to Missouri, taking a big hit financially and having to take part of our mortgage with us.  We appreciate all that the financial institutions in Virginia allowed us to do, in order to leave the area, even though we are really struggling.  We are currently living in the same house as my in-laws. As for jobs, Medicaid regulations have changed. For qualified candidates in social work positions that we have experience in, you now need a master's degree to do jobs that we have 12 years of experience in.  My wife's weakened state prevents her from getting a job, let alone by the time we would pay for a sitter and gas to get her to work, we would use most of the money and not be any further ahead in addition to all of the weekly medical expenses still looming.  I've taken a great job, but it pays less than what I was getting in Virginia and insuring my family would literally take 90% of my check. We're currently trying to figure out if the Affordable Healthcare Act can help us, since we cannot afford my work-provided insurance.  When applying for the AHA, we were told we don't make enough to qualify for the subsidies, kicking us into Medicaid status, but it's difficult to find specialists around this area that my wife needs to survive that accept Medicaid. <br/></p><p>There are major big bills that we face. The largest one being the cost 
of insurance.  We are currently still paying $800/month, which is going on a 
credit card we opened for this reason, as we have no other means to pay
 it. We still have excellent credit, but we are concerned this will 
change. As I mentioned earlier, we shopped around, but pre-existing 
conditions made no company available to help my wife. As of right now, 
since we can no longer put insurance on our credit card, Renee could be 
uninsured as of January 1, unless the AHA comes through.  </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/220809/files/20131124175803-rowren2.jpg?1385344683"" src="""" style=""width: 360px; height: 294px;""/></p><p>We estimate that we have hundreds of thousands, if not a potential

</ul></div>","Please note: some events depicted are graphic in nature. Please take care in reading.My wife and I started with one of those picture-perfect stories: met by happenstance on the internet to fall in love, young, energetic people out to conquer life excitedly with their college education and the will of God. Started the family, bought the house, pounded down debt, and started saving up for a rainy day. We had no idea that a rainy day could last so long.When we decided to have our youngest child, Rowan, it was a long struggle. We tried and tried to have a little sibling for our fun and energetic son Ryland, but things weren't working out. It was recommended that we either use medical assistance to get pregnant or officially end the capability for pregnancy for the health of my wife when we suddenly learned that she was pregnant. The pregnancy itself was a blessing and went by without any issues, except for the fact that an ovarian cyst was growing along with my son. In early May, our ten-pound baby was to be delivered, and an almost ten-pound cyst was present as well.  Our bouncing baby boy was born completely healthy though.  When the doctors did the c-section to bring our son into the world, as well as remove the cyst, the cyst ruptured. I was rushed out of the room with our new boy in my arms so that the doctors could finish taking care of my wife. As I sat there with my little boy, those few hours seemed like days. No doctor was available to tell me if my wife was okay, and I had no idea if the cyst rupture was serious or not. The cyst turned out to be non-harmful after lab testing.  But while I was waiting for her to come out, I snuggled our new boy and prayed he would know his mother. She eventually came out, but it was a scary few hours.Our family continued as most would after a birth, learning new methods and getting to know how everyone worked together as a family. Soon, however, my wife Renee began having issues. At three weeks postpartum, she developed her first major fever of 105. She would get sick, get antibiotics, get better, then drop right back down to being sick. After two weeks Renee developed bilateral sciatica and she was unable to move. It became frustratingly repetitive as every time we went to the emergency room, we constantly were told, ""oh, it's just an infection, here's some antibiotics"" to turn around and do it again. As my wife got weaker and things became overwhelming, we took a vacation from my job in Virginia to visit our nearest family in Missouri for a bit of a respite and healing.The night we got to Missouri, however, Renee got sick again, this time to the point she had to be admitted to the hospital. They stated that the infection she had was so bad it had gotten into her bloodstream. She was septic with pseudomonas and enterococcus fecalis. She needed immediate IV antibiotics. Our vacation and relaxation immediately turned into juggling our two little boys and supporting my wife, scared out of her mind in the hospital, all alone unless I was able to go. She wasn't getting better, and I was running out of vacation time. We had no choice: I had to drive back to Virginia, leaving my kids in my wife's mother's care, and my sick wife in the hospital, unsure if I would ever see her again.When my wife finally got better a month later, I drove back, picked her up, and headed back to Virginia. Halfway through Kentucky, though, she got worse again, and we had to stop. Another emergency room overnight, another ""it's just an infection"", another antibiotic. Another disheartening unknown answer to everything. On the way back into town in Virginia, I had no chance but to drop the kids at the babysitter, drop my wife at the emergency room, and run off to work. I had literally exhausted every other option. At the hospital, my wife was being told yet again that she was having an infection, here's some antibiotics. Just a few weeks earlier, she had been told at a clinic that she must be drug seeking to seek medical help so often in a short period of time.  By now it was July, and Renee was fed up and at her wit's end.  She told the doctors she would not leave the hospital until further testing was done on her kidneys, as she felt she had a stone stuck somewhere, or a kidney infection.  They agreed to a CT scan, where they discovered a multitude of kidney stones and a kidney infection!

Our hearts dropped, and we felt so devastated. Eloy was then admitted for 5 days for further testing and a Biopsy of the tumor. The doctors reassured us it was necessary, that way they would know how to treat him. </strong><br/><strong>Its been 2 months since then, we have learned a whole new language of medical terms and we have managed to get a grip and remain strong and positive for Eloy. He is teaching us a lot through this journey, he remains brave and strong even after enduring long hours of chemotherapy. We are so proud of him but at the same time it breaks our hearts, because he should just be a healthy normal 5yr old with no worries. We try to take care of our children the best way we know how, but sometimes there's just things that we as parents cant understand. We pray everyday that God guide the specialist and doctors in making the right decisions for our sons well being, and we pray for strength to help him get through this fight....</strong>

It was May 1st, 2013 when the nightmare began after an Emergency room visit, and numerous test and scans, only verified that Eloy's firm liver was not Enlarged, but they had found what looked like a malignant tumor (cancer). Our hearts dropped, and we felt so devastated. Eloy was then admitted for 5 days for further testing and a Biopsy of the tumor. The doctors reassured us it was necessary, that way they would know how to treat him. Its been 2 months since then, we have learned a whole new language of medical terms and we have managed to get a grip and remain strong and positive for Eloy. He is teaching us a lot through this journey, he remains brave and strong even after enduring long hours of chemotherapy. We are so proud of him but at the same time it breaks our hearts, because he should just be a healthy normal 5yr old with no worries. We try to take care of our children the best way we know how, but sometimes there's just things that we as parents cant understand. We pray everyday that God guide the specialist and doctors in making the right decisions for our sons well being, and we pray for strength to help him get through this fight....

My friend, Yolanda is a stay at home mom and needs all the help she can get right now.
Please help with your donations and prayers. Together we can make little Eloy get better. God bless",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Thomas A. Warner Running for a Cure. (<a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/thomas-a-warner-running-for-a-cure-to-raise-awareness-for-huntington-s-disease/www.tawrunningforacure.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.tawrunningforacure.com</a>) was established to raise awareness for Huntington's disease by incorporating my passion for running and my motivation to help find a cure for (HD). On May 1st, 2014 I will begin running across the country from San Diego, CA to Syracuse, NY - almost 3000 miles, teaming up with the Huntington's Disease Society of America Pacific West Region <a href=""http://www.firstgiving.com/fundraiser/tomwarner/thomasawarnerrunningforacure"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.firstgiving.com/fundraiser/tomwarner/thomasawarnerrunningforacure</a> </p>
<p>   Huntington's Disease (HD) has made a huge impact on me, my family, and my life It is my intention to help raise awareness for this disease, </p>
<p>   This run is in honor of the people I love who have suffered and continue to suffer from the effects of (HD).</p>
<p>- Louise (Angelino) Warner - My mother, who has been living with (HD) for over 15 years.</p>
<p>- Carol (Angelino) Miller - My aunt who passed away last May from complications arising from (HD).</p>
<p>- Kathleen O'Neill - My friend, Shannon and Erin Kristen O'Neil's mother, who was diagnosed in August of 2001.</p>
<p>- Adam Barnes and his family.</p>
<p>- My two brothers and their families as well as my seven Angelino cousin’s.</p>
<p>   I am also running in honor of all the families and caregivers who have dedicated their lives to support loved ones with (HD).</p>
<p>​<span style=""letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 1.45em;""> I've lived in San Diego for nearly six years and before that Orlando, FL and Syracuse, NY. I’m an avid runner and a few years ago I began thinking about what I could do to help my family with their current situation. Since I was a teenager, </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0.8999999761581421px;"">I've</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 1.45em;""> always wanted to run across the country, and at the time it was just an idea which I never thought could become a reality. But after seeing what my father has gone through by sacrificing his time and his life to take care of my beautiful mother for the last 12 years (they were high school sweethearts and have been married for over 40 years) and watching him work so hard keeping up with his masonry business and listening to his struggles, I knew I had to do something to help find a cure and raise awareness about (HD). This past April, I left my job as a branch manager for Sunbelt Rentals in San Diego and spent most of the summer in Syracuse helping my dad. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0.8999999761581421px;"">I've</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 1.45em;""> decided now is the time to take action. In August I took my retirement savings to start this nonprofit, I decided to incorporate my love of running with my passion of finding a cure for this disease. The effects of (HD) on my family are countless and I know there are so many others in need of support and assistance; this is my goal and my vision for the future.</span></p>

<p> In order for me to organize this run, (this will be the first run across the country for raising awareness for Huntington’s disease ) I need your support!  Without your support this run will not be possible! I am looking for donations and sponsors to help me with the funding with a goal of $570,000 that will be allocated as follows: </p>
<p>I will be raising/donating $150,000 for the Huntington's Disease Society of America that will go towards continued research for helping the HDSA find a cure for which affects 1 in 10,0000 people in the US. Check out my HDSA fund raising page at: <a href=""http://www.firstgiving.com/fundraiser/tomwarner/thomasawarnerrunningforacure"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.firstgiving.com/fundraiser/tomwarner/thomasawarnerrunningforacure</a> </p>
<p>The rest of the donations &amp; sponsorship's will be going towards setting up grants for the Thomas A Warner Running For A Cure Nonprofit to help families currently affected by (HD) and are in financial need. And to support this 2850 mile run that will be raising awareness for (HD). I am in need of funding for the following: </p>

<p>I will be running a marathon for almost 109 consecutive days to reach my destination of Syracuse, NY- totaling 2850 miles by August 17th 2014. The purpose of this run is to help the continued efforts of researcher's and the Huntington's Disease Society of America in finding a cure for Huntington's Disease (HD). My family and I have felt the impact of this disease first hand with both my mother who is terminally ill, wheel chair bound and needs full time care, given by my father, Tom and my Aunt Sandy.

Thomas A. Warner Running for a Cure. (www.tawrunningforacure.com) was established to raise awareness for Huntington's disease by incorporating my passion for running and my motivation to help find a cure for (HD). On May 1st, 2014 I will begin running across the country from San Diego, CA to Syracuse, NY - almost 3000 miles, teaming up with the Huntington's Disease Society of America Pacific West Region http://www.firstgiving.com/fundraiser/tomwarner/thomasawarnerrunningforacure 
   Huntington's Disease (HD) has made a huge impact on me, my family, and my life It is my intention to help raise awareness for this disease, 
   This run is in honor of the people I love who have suffered and continue to suffer from the effects of (HD).
- Louise (Angelino) Warner - My mother, who has been living with (HD) for over 15 years.
- Carol (Angelino) Miller - My aunt who passed away last May from complications arising from (HD).
- Kathleen O'Neill - My friend, Shannon and Erin Kristen O'Neil's mother, who was diagnosed in August of 2001.
- Adam Barnes and his family.
- My two brothers and their families as well as my seven Angelino cousin’s.
   I am also running in honor of all the families and caregivers who have dedicated their lives to support loved ones with (HD).
​ I've lived in San Diego for nearly six years and before that Orlando, FL and Syracuse, NY. I’m an avid runner and a few years ago I began thinking about what I could do to help my family with their current situation. Since I was a teenager, I've always wanted to run across the country, and at the time it was just an idea which I never thought could become a reality. But after seeing what my father has gone through by sacrificing his time and his life to take care of my beautiful mother for the last 12 years (they were high school sweethearts and have been married for over 40 years) and watching him work so hard keeping up with his masonry business and listening to his struggles, I knew I had to do something to help find a cure and raise awareness about (HD). This past April, I left my job as a branch manager for Sunbelt Rentals in San Diego and spent most of the summer in Syracuse helping my dad. I've decided now is the time to take action. In August I took my retirement savings to start this nonprofit, I decided to incorporate my love of running with my passion of finding a cure for this disease. The effects of (HD) on my family are countless and I know there are so many others in need of support and assistance; this is my goal and my vision for the future.

​ What We Need & What You Get




 In order for me to organize this run, (this will be the first run across the country for raising awareness for Huntington’s disease ) I need your support!  Without your support this run will not be possible! I am looking for donations and sponsors to help me with the funding with a goal of $570,000 that will be allocated as follows: 
I will be raising/donating $150,000 for the Huntington's Disease Society of America that will go towards continued research for helping the HDSA find a cure for which affects 1 in 10,0000 people in the US. Check out my HDSA fund raising page at: http://www.firstgiving.com/fundraiser/tomwarner/thomasawarnerrunningforacure 
The rest of the donations & sponsorship's will be going towards setting up grants for the Thomas A Warner Running For A Cure Nonprofit to help families currently affected by (HD) and are in financial need. And to support this 2850 mile run that will be raising awareness for (HD). I am in need of funding for the following: 
- RV either by donation or renting 
- Gas/Diesel (Donations, by gas cards, gift cards or funds) 
- Support Team (looking to hire 2 to 3 people to come along on this journey) 
- My Workouts & Training  (which takes up 3 to 6 hours a day)

<p>Wayne, an intelligent hard-working man,
was tragically paralyzed two years ago in a car accident in Belize, and
needs immediate support to provide a foundation for living and healing so he
may regain a meaningful life. His third-world living conditions are unsafe, he
is malnourished, has received no rehabilitation, needs medical attention,
supplies, equipment, and a trained caregiver.</p>
<p>We are raising funds for our Belizean
friend Wayne Coleman in Dangriga, Belize. We are “Wayne’s Team”, and with Bahá’í friends in three countries, we created this campaign to ask for contributions which
are vital for Wayne. Each of us knows Wayne from working or vacationing in

<li>$125 monthly, approximately, for
     medical consumables (MD visits, sterile gloves, bandages, ointments, etc)</li>
<li>$4,100 to repay just one-half of

Wayne</b>: until 2012 Wayne was a vegetable
vendor at the open air Central Market in Dangriga where he sold produce. While
driving to Belmopan to purchase product one evening he skidded off the wet road
and suffered a nearly fatal accident. At the hospital, his spinal cord was
found to be severed leaving the lower half of his body paralyzed, and his legs
crushed.<span>  After initial surgeries in
multiple government hospitals Wayne continues to be bedridden which resulted in
large, deep pressure sores and upper body weakness. He is also prone to infections
and seizures. </span></p>
<p>He has had difficulty getting effective
long-term medical care. His caregiver is willing but untrained, but access to
medical equipment and supplies is difficult, limited, and expensive. He has
consumed his financial resources, and needs sound guidance in the management of
his long-term care. His condition is <i><u>most
challenging</u></i> in Belize where access to specialized medical resources and
attention is available only to those who are exceptionally fortunate or who can
travel abroad.</p>
<p>Wayne lives in a simple wooden house
which he built himself and is without air conditioning or indoor plumbing. He
cannot get out of bed by himself, has an indwelling catheter and dangerous bedsores due to his lack of consistent care and proper nutrition. Prior to
receiving a standard hospital bed a few weeks ago, he <b><i>lived</i></b> on a narrow, flat,
old-fashioned hospital gurney with a pad which promoted the development of his
pressure sores. He sometimes cooks simple food on his bedside hot plate. </p>
<p>He recently received a kind
contribution of a laptop and a year’s internet service which connects him to the

<p>Wayne
faces his ordeals with patience, ordeals which might drive many of us into
hopelessness and despair. We might ask ourselves how we might react after
losing our independence, being bedridden and unable to take care of ourselves?
Wayne is a man of strong Faith, he reads and prays regularly. Wayne is an

magnificent, flamboyant tree, as I Sat gazing into the horizon I heard the
beautiful sound of a Lark. She sang with such a sweet refrain.
 
Melodiously she harmonized
with the same serenity that I felt Inside, making me feel good to be alive.
 
Sitting here, resting my
bones pondering on the issues of Life, searching for solutions,
 
My mind reflects on some of
yesteryear’s wise saying:
“Knowledge hidden from the
wise and prudent will be Revealed to the babe and sucklings,- the pure of
heart.”
 So
for reasons more than one, 
When you pass this way looking
for me, 
Don't be amazed if you find
me here, 
Sitting on this same old bench

Watching the passers- by.
 Sometimes
you might even catch me gazing into the sky 
On this, same old bench.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

At that time, I had just sent English/Creole dictionaries to Haiti for the school he so generously runs for Haitian children. I knew he was unable to get the surgery at that time, due to financial constraints. But when he reached out to me again this month, NINE months later and still suffering the pain from this hernia, I said that I would make sure we got it taken care of. This would not happen in the U.S. and it upsets me so much that he can't access the healthcare he needs in Haiti. $650 is really not a lot to get this guy feeling good again and in his top capacity to help other Haitians in need. I'm hoping this campaign can raise the needed expenses quickly! We already have the hospital and doctor lined up for this.
