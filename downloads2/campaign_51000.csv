</p><p><b>Once A Marine:</b></p><p>Once a Marine is a documentary about coming home from war from the perspective of the Marine infantrymen that fought on the front lines of the war in Afghanistan. </p><p>After getting out of the military, many veterans struggle with depression, loss of purpose, and suicidal ideation. The effects of PTSD have been well publicized, but for the men with the diagnosis, the symptoms they suffer are part of a much larger experience that changed them forever, both for good and for bad. No matter how successful combat veterans end up ""transitioning"" back to the civilian world, war was the most formative and, to date, most significant part of their lives.</p><p>Once a Marine tells the story of adjusting to civilian life after war.</p><p><br/></p><p><b>From the Director:</b></p><p></p><p>My name is Stephen Canty and six years ago I was a Marine infantryman fighting in Marjah Afghanistan, a place that was called at the time ""the last Taliban stronghold"" Now, as a civilian I am trying to make a documentary about the Marines I fought alongside in Afghanistan and their struggle to return to civilian life. </p><p>Combat is indescribable. It is humanity at both its best and worse. I never felt more alive than when I was that close to death. But when we started to lose marines from our company, I found I had to get comfortable with the idea of not coming home to deal with the realities of war. Six months after my second deployment to Afghanistan, I was out of the military and back in my hometown. </p><p>I joined the Marines in 2007 at just seventeen years old. Technically, I was still a high-school senior. At the time I was enrolled in the best courses my high-school had to offer, pursuing all those things middle class kids do to look good for college admissions officers. But I felt I needed to prove something to myself. So I left from all of my advanced classes and graduated early in order to go to boot-camp in the middle of my senior year. My teachers said I was throwing away my education. Little did they know, hell I didn't even know, what kind of education I was about to get. </p><p>I didn't plan much before I got out. I just wanted to be done. I got a job, went to college and tried to move on. I was doing well by all accounts, but still felt numb towards life. I couldn't maintain personal relationships, started drinking and doing drugs, and struggled to find a purpose. One day I bought a camera and started filming everything around me. </p><p>I started looking at film schools and thought a  documentary about the transition from combat to civilian life would be unique enough to get me in. Little did I know that the film would taken on a life of its own.</p><p> I called some of the guys I was in with to see if they'd be willing to talk. Many of us hadn't spoken since we'd gotten out of the Marines. I'd assumed everyone was doing better than I was. We'd only spoken on Facebook and never about anything important. I called a few guys up and our phone calls lasted for hours. As it turned out, we were all in the same boat.</p><p>After talking with just three of them, I realized that they all mentioned the same issues; depression, lack of purpose, bitterness, and difficulties that they had in dealing with the loss of friends. We thought about Afghanistan all the time. The budding film-maker in me realized there was a story here. </p><p>I couldn't film much besides interviews; I didn't have the budget to stay in any location for more than a weekend or the equipment to make any handheld shooting look more than amateur video. But I cut a trailer and people started to take notice of what I had. They saw that these guys were willing to talk with me openly and honestly because I was one of their own and they had at one point trusted me to watch their backs. </p><p>Marines I served with messaged me on Facebook tell me, ""I'm glad to know I'm not the only one that feels this way."" Marines I hadn't served with told me they were glad someone was finally telling our story. </p><p>A few weeks after posting the trailer, one of my closest friends from the Marine Corps, Doss, came down on a train from Schenectady, New York to spend the weekend with me. He paid for the ticket himself because I couldn't afford it. He'd kicked the heroin habit he'd developed shortly after getting out of the Marines and wanted to sit down for an interview. Doss got out 3 months before me. I used to call him just to hear how awesome it would be when I got out. </p><p></p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt=""Doss during our interview."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/000/924/658/89510bdd6be9dc8ff4b6978415789e22_original.jpg?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1379308067&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=4af57877140775f1afdddc312c33e5aa"" src="""" style=""""/><figcaption>Doss during our interview.</figcaption></figure><p></p><p>By the time I got out, Doss had less positive things to say about being a civilian. In the first few months after getting out, many of us had tried calling him but he started answering less and less. In the Marine Corps, Doss was always comic relief. He wasn't so funny as heroin took over his life. </p><p></p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt=""Doss showing off his tats and tracks."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/000/924/660/4bcc71d7b6744ca787c348fab3cb0ae6_original.jpg?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1379308083&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=5d1c3e4e53b75204af9816f8a58f05fa"" src="""" style=""""/><figcaption>Doss showing off his tattos and track marks.</figcaption><figcaption><br/></figcaption></figure><p>I realized that this was something greater than making a short documentary for film school. I was telling a story that had never been told. </p><p><b>What We Need Money For:</b></p><p>As it stands the film is about 80 percent done. I've gotten the film as far as I can alone.

The effects of PTSD have been well publicized, but for the men with the diagnosis, the symptoms they suffer are part of a much larger experience that changed them forever, both for good and for bad. No matter how successful combat veterans end up ""transitioning"" back to the civilian world, war was the most formative and, to date, most significant part of their lives.Once a Marine tells the story of adjusting to civilian life after war.From the Director:My name is Stephen Canty and six years ago I was a Marine infantryman fighting in Marjah Afghanistan, a place that was called at the time ""the last Taliban stronghold"" Now, as a civilian I am trying to make a documentary about the Marines I fought alongside in Afghanistan and their struggle to return to civilian life. Combat is indescribable. It is humanity at both its best and worse. I never felt more alive than when I was that close to death. But when we started to lose marines from our company, I found I had to get comfortable with the idea of not coming home to deal with the realities of war. Six months after my second deployment to Afghanistan, I was out of the military and back in my hometown. I joined the Marines in 2007 at just seventeen years old. Technically, I was still a high-school senior. At the time I was enrolled in the best courses my high-school had to offer, pursuing all those things middle class kids do to look good for college admissions officers. But I felt I needed to prove something to myself. So I left from all of my advanced classes and graduated early in order to go to boot-camp in the middle of my senior year. My teachers said I was throwing away my education. Little did they know, hell I didn't even know, what kind of education I was about to get. I didn't plan much before I got out. I just wanted to be done. I got a job, went to college and tried to move on. I was doing well by all accounts, but still felt numb towards life. I couldn't maintain personal relationships, started drinking and doing drugs, and struggled to find a purpose. One day I bought a camera and started filming everything around me. I started looking at film schools and thought a  documentary about the transition from combat to civilian life would be unique enough to get me in. Little did I know that the film would taken on a life of its own. I called some of the guys I was in with to see if they'd be willing to talk. Many of us hadn't spoken since we'd gotten out of the Marines. I'd assumed everyone was doing better than I was. We'd only spoken on Facebook and never about anything important. I called a few guys up and our phone calls lasted for hours. As it turned out, we were all in the same boat.After talking with just three of them, I realized that they all mentioned the same issues; depression, lack of purpose, bitterness, and difficulties that they had in dealing with the loss of friends. We thought about Afghanistan all the time. The budding film-maker in me realized there was a story here. I couldn't film much besides interviews; I didn't have the budget to stay in any location for more than a weekend or the equipment to make any handheld shooting look more than amateur video. But I cut a trailer and people started to take notice of what I had. They saw that these guys were willing to talk with me openly and honestly because I was one of their own and they had at one point trusted me to watch their backs. Marines I served with messaged me on Facebook tell me, ""I'm glad to know I'm not the only one that feels this way."" Marines I hadn't served with told me they were glad someone was finally telling our story. A few weeks after posting the trailer, one of my closest friends from the Marine Corps, Doss, came down on a train from Schenectady, New York to spend the weekend with me. He paid for the ticket himself because I couldn't afford it. He'd kicked the heroin habit he'd developed shortly after getting out of the Marines and wanted to sit down for an interview. Doss got out 3 months before me. I used to call him just to hear how awesome it would be when I got out. Doss during our interview.By the time I got out, Doss had less positive things to say about being a civilian. In the first few months after getting out, many of us had tried calling him but he started answering less and less. In the Marine Corps, Doss was always comic relief. He wasn't so funny as heroin took over his life. Doss showing off his tattos and track marks.I realized that this was something greater than making a short documentary for film school. I was telling a story that had never been told. What We Need Money For:As it stands the film is about 80 percent done. I've gotten the film as far as I can alone. The content and story of the film is in place. However, it lacks the polish that only money can buy-sound design, color correction, titles, and additional B-roll. The goal of raising money on Indiegogo is to make the film look the best that it can. I'll spend two weeks traveling the East Coast where the film's subjects are located shooting additional footage and adding the finishing touches to the story. I've been carrying this burden for three years and finally the end is in sight. I'm proud of the Marines that participated and myself for never giving up on this project. With your help, I can finish this project and bring this story to the world.",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div><div> <p>Where the money will be used:</p> <ul> <li>
<p>I need $36,000 to upgrade my equipment and bring a crew to Philadelphia for two weeks.</p>
<p>My current equipment consists of a 10-year-old Nikon P100, I paid $84 for it at a pawn shop in Detroit three years ago when I went ""digital"". I use a Hero 2 GoPro for video capture.</p>
<p>The quality of the images have suffered greatly in some circumstances because I have to shoot ""on the run"" without a tripod, and using the cheap digital camera without digital stabilization can sometimes be a waste of effort on everyone's behalf. Also, using my antiquated GoPro camera draws a lot of attention; the chest strap looks like I'm wearing a gun holster from behind, and the camera itself sticks out like a sore thumb - when the point is to try to operate in stealth. I have done my homework, and have come to the conclusion that following equipment is ideally suited for my needs:</p>
<p>Sony - HDR-AS50R HD Action Camera - Black <span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Model: HDRAS50R/B with digital </span>stabilization<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> and high definition will allow for crystal clear video captures of the entire process, even ""on the run."" Five cameras (controllable from one wrist unit) 5 x $250 = $1250. Wrist unit = $100. Total= $1350.</span></span></p>
<p>Wireless-hands-free communication system: Motorola sells a walkie-talkie system that will allow the team to communicate with each other at a distance of up to a quarter mile. The cost is $250 for the four person communication package. </p>
<p>Apple - MacBook® Pro - 15.4"" Display - Intel Core i7 - 16GB Memory - 1TB Flash Storage - Silver <span style=""background-color: initial;"">Model: Z0RG1LL/A This will allow us the capacity to edit video on site, and to broadcast ""live"" on the Internet. $3199.99</span></p>
<p>Epson - WorkForce WF-7620 Wireless Wide-Format All-In-One Printer - Black <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Model: C11CC97201 $299.99. This will allow me to give every volunteer an 8 x 10 of every location they appear in within a day, and make large prints for a gallery show at the tail-end of the visit.</span></p>

<li><p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""> Sony - Alpha a7 II Full-Frame Mirrorless Camera with 28-70mm Lens - Black Model:ILCE7M2K/B $1999.99 each X2 = $3999.98 . This camera has the fastest auto focus in the world and 5 point stabilization along with 24.3 megapixels. This will help me deliver crisp shots that can be blown up to any size.</span></p></li>
<li>Of course the daily expenses of food, transportation, lodging, parking, gas and a dozen small ""nickle and dime"" things (e.g. laundry, snacks, tips, bottled water) are a significant part of the expense of this trip. The bulk of the budget will go to the crew: five very skilled people will have to commit two weeks of their lives to this project. One, the video editor, will continue on for several days after the visit. For the crew portion of the budget I have set aside $15,000. This budget, distributed proportionately, will allow me to compensate the crew fairly for each of their roles. </li>

<p><b style=""background-color: initial;"">WHAT WE NEED YOUR MONEY FOR:</b><br/></p>
<p>So, you’re asking why we need the cash?... That is a fair enough question to ask. Well, we are about to wrap up filming on the 25th of September 2016 and to ensure we can deliver a final scene truly worthy of a visual, shock and awe experience we need to raise a little fund for the make up and special effects on that day (The Last Day.. Of filming.. Like what I did there?)</p>
<p>The film has relied on using practical effects as the director prefers this to the use of c.g.i, we want to make it look as real as possible and that is where the contributions will make the difference.</p>
<p>Now, we want you to feel awesome for contributing so if you do; any contributor will get a thanks in the end credit of the movie. Not only that, from a donation of £20.00 onwards you will get a digital link to the film a week before the general release of the film, you will be the first to experience <b>THE LAST DAY </b>before anyone else (well except for the next awesome person who reads this and donates, then you get to watch it the same time as them, unless your friends and then why not make it a viewing party?!... Obviously feel free to invite us!) </p>
<p><b>Like I said before, we have 90% in the can and a final shooting date and everything else is ready on the editing front, so at this point we are (pretty ballsy in saying it, but..) confident that the project is going to get finished regardless.</b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1465770352/vlcsnap-2014-10-30-14h34m10s52_wrjfmi.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p><b>The only challenge, is that if the goal isn't met we just have to reduce the practical effects to meet the budget we have.</b></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Of course you don't just have to contribute to help out, if you could share the trailer and this indiegogo across social media that contributes greatly to the cause, the more people that get to hear about the project the more buzz we can create.</span></p>

Well, we are about to wrap up filming on the 25th of September 2016 and to ensure we can deliver a final scene truly worthy of a visual, shock and awe experience we need to raise a little fund for the make up and special effects on that day (The Last Day.. Of filming.. Like what I did there?)
The film has relied on using practical effects as the director prefers this to the use of c.g.i, we want to make it look as real as possible and that is where the contributions will make the difference.
Now, we want you to feel awesome for contributing so if you do; any contributor will get a thanks in the end credit of the movie. Not only that, from a donation of £20.00 onwards you will get a digital link to the film a week before the general release of the film, you will be the first to experience THE LAST DAY before anyone else (well except for the next awesome person who reads this and donates, then you get to watch it the same time as them, unless your friends and then why not make it a viewing party?!... Obviously feel free to invite us!) 
Like I said before, we have 90% in the can and a final shooting date and everything else is ready on the editing front, so at this point we are (pretty ballsy in saying it, but..) confident that the project is going to get finished regardless.

The only challenge, is that if the goal isn't met we just have to reduce the practical effects to meet the budget we have.
Of course you don't just have to contribute to help out, if you could share the trailer and this indiegogo across social media that contributes greatly to the cause, the more people that get to hear about the project the more buzz we can create.",9.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>Camera: </strong>Miles Andersen is another accomplished filmmaker from the Seattle area. His works have also been featured in NFFTY alongside Mesler's. You can catch Miles Andersen's award winning music video ""Hologram"" here: <a href=""https://vimeo.com/150612313"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://vimeo.com/150612313</a></p>
<p>A couple of Miles Andersen's awards include:</p>
<p>Award of Excellence, Music Video - Northwest High School Film Festival</p>
<p>Student Production Award, Photographer/Editor - Northwest Regional Emmy Awards<br/>Best of Show - Eppfilms &amp; Artistic by Design Center 2015 Film &amp; Photography Showcase<br/>Official Selection - National Film Festival for Talented Youth</p>
<p><strong>Art Director: </strong>Emma Obrietan is another visual artist, whose work has also been on display in the Seattle Art Museum. </p>
<p><strong>Audio Technician/ Composer: </strong>Practically born in front of the keyboard, Scotty Mckinney has been making amazing music for as long as anyone can remember. He is the lead singer and keyboard artist of the small Seattle band, 400-40.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We're looking for 8,000 USD, yes 8,000 dollars. While it might seem like a whopping amount, film making is expensive, and the costs of equipment and lodging are a serious burden for the wallet of a teenager. Your contributions to our project however, will be handsomely rewarded. Any money you send our way will be greatly appreciated, and all contributors are, in our minds, part of the team.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Beach Club</h3>
<p>Beach Club is more than a movie. This project is not only TTYL's initial step into the movie industry as a production company, but also a work of inspiration for other young dreamers.  Our goal is for the audience not to be able to tell that this is a super low budget film made in one month. Of course challenges come with that, but we hope that with your support we can prove that not every movie has to be made by a middle aged man backed by a multi-million dollar corporation. Beach Club is not just about the futility of human desire, but also about film as an art form instead of a corporate venture. </p>

<div><b>Note d'intention (Our intentions) :</b></div>
<div>
<b>
</b><p>
</p>
<p><i><b>Forever! Or Almost…</b> </i>est le résultat de nombreuses versions d’écriture dont les premières ébauches ont été faites il y a trois ans. À l’époque le film n’était alors qu’un très court-métrage d’une dizaine de minutes. Quelques années plus tard, le scénario original fut repris, modifié et amélioré, pour former la version actuelle du projet, triplant également sa durée (30 minutes). </p>
<p><i style=""background-color: initial;""><b>Forever! Or Almost…</b></i><span style=""background-color: initial;""> traite principalement de la rupture amoureuse et à été écrit en réponse à cet événement qui survient dans la vie de tout le monde un jour ou l’autre. Il est donc basé sur des faits réels mais reste tout de même un film de fiction. C’est ainsi que le film s’appuie sur la phrase finale «</span><b style=""background-color: initial;""> <i>Inspiré de millions d’histoires vraies…</i> </b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">». Le film s’inspire également d’événement réellement vécus par ses co-réalisateurs ce qui lui donne un ton plus personnel par moments.</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Le choix de traiter l’histoire par le biais du personnage masculin était d’amener un regard nouveau sur un sujet le plus souvent traité du point de vue de la femme. Le film vient alors montrer que ce n’est pas toujours l’homme qui est en tord comme semble le montrer la plupart des films hollywoodiens actuellement à la mode. Ce film dépeint le portrait d’un jeune homme de nos jours qui tente de trouver sa place à travers les relations interpersonnelles. </span><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Le choix de tourner ce film en <b>anglais</b> a été pris très rapidement, dès l’écriture, bien que le scénario ait été écrit en français puis adapté à l’anglais dans un second temps. Ce choix s’explique notamment par le fait que le sujet traité dans le film est un sujet sans frontière, qui arrive à tout le monde et que l’anglais était la langue la plus appropriée pour que le film puisse être vu  et compris dans le monde entier.</p>

<h3>Pourquoi nous aider ? (Why help us?)</h3>
<p>Votre impact est concret et va nous être très utile.</p>
<p>En effet, nous avons besoin de financement principalement pour la location du matériel technique, pour l'achat des accessoires, des costumes et des décors, ainsi que les autres frais relatifs à la nourriture, aux transports, aux droits musicaux etc.</p>
<p>Notre projet est ambitieux : l'histoire se déploie dans plusieurs décors publiques qu'ils soient extérieurs ou intérieurs qui demandent des permis et autorisations. Nous sommes très conscients du fait qu'un tel projet demande un investissement important et des moyens conséquents. Votre aide financière nous permettra de concrétiser nos intentions afin de donner le meilleur résultat possible.</p>

Brève description du projet (Brief description of our project)

""Inspiré de millions d'histoires vraies...""
Il s'agit donc d'un projet de court-métrage de fiction qui devrait durer environ 30 minutes et dont le tournage s'étalera sur 10 jours, entre la fin du mois de mai et le début du mois de juin.
Nous souhaitons ensuite faire vivre ce film dans d'autres événements et festivals!
Aidez-nous à concrétiser notre beau projet!
--------------------
""Inspired by millions of true story...""
This project consists of a 30 min fiction short-film for which production should last 10 days, with shooting starting around the end of May and ending at the beginning of June.
We then wish to share this film throughout numerous events and festivals! Please, help make this wonderful project of ours reality!


Synopsis :
Aveuglé par le tourment causé par le départ de Mélanie, Martin se lance dans une quête de réponses qui l'amènera à découvrir un douloureux secret. Avec l'aide de ses amis, Julien et Léa, Martin est prêt à tout pour donner un sens à cette rupture, qui est pour lui insurmontable. C'est alors que commence une aventure insensée qui mènera Martin dans des situations absurdes. De la colère à la tristesse, il passera aussi par le désir de la reconquérir pour parvenir à aller de l'avant...


Note d'intention (Our intentions) :




Forever! Or Almost… est le résultat de nombreuses versions d’écriture dont les premières ébauches ont été faites il y a trois ans. À l’époque le film n’était alors qu’un très court-métrage d’une dizaine de minutes. Quelques années plus tard, le scénario original fut repris, modifié et amélioré, pour former la version actuelle du projet, triplant également sa durée (30 minutes). 
Forever! Or Almost… traite principalement de la rupture amoureuse et à été écrit en réponse à cet événement qui survient dans la vie de tout le monde un jour ou l’autre. Il est donc basé sur des faits réels mais reste tout de même un film de fiction. C’est ainsi que le film s’appuie sur la phrase finale « Inspiré de millions d’histoires vraies… ». Le film s’inspire également d’événement réellement vécus par ses co-réalisateurs ce qui lui donne un ton plus personnel par moments.
Le choix de traiter l’histoire par le biais du personnage masculin était d’amener un regard nouveau sur un sujet le plus souvent traité du point de vue de la femme. Le film vient alors montrer que ce n’est pas toujours l’homme qui est en tord comme semble le montrer la plupart des films hollywoodiens actuellement à la mode. Ce film dépeint le portrait d’un jeune homme de nos jours qui tente de trouver sa place à travers les relations interpersonnelles. 

Le choix de tourner ce film en anglais a été pris très rapidement, dès l’écriture, bien que le scénario ait été écrit en français puis adapté à l’anglais dans un second temps. Ce choix s’explique notamment par le fait que le sujet traité dans le film est un sujet sans frontière, qui arrive à tout le monde et que l’anglais était la langue la plus appropriée pour que le film puisse être vu  et compris dans le monde entier.




Qui sommes nous ? (Who are we?)




BIO DE MARIE


Jeune français expatrié au Québec depuis près de 5 ans, Valentin Verrier est actuellement étudiant en cinéma à l’Université de Montréal, après avoir travaillé comme reporter-monteur et producteur exécutif en France pour LMDL production qu’il avait co-fondée. Suite à ses envies d’entreprendre la production cinématographique au Québec, il co-fondera Welcome Aboard en septembre 2015 avec Stéphanie Demers-Hébert. Lui donnant alors la possibilité d’exercer le poste de producteur délégué mais aussi de s’essayer à la réalisation de projets de fiction tel que Forever! Or Almost… . Le Jouet Extraordinaire est quant à lui le deuxième film dont il endosse le rôle de producteur délégué.
Notre équipe (Our team):
Jeunes et passionnés par le cinéma, les membres de notre équipe ont tous en tête le même but : réaliser un film professionnel en se basant sur nos expériences passées sur d'autres productions ainsi que sur celles acquises lors de nos études. Ce projet est également rassembleur car toutes les Universités montréalaises sont représentées au sein de notre équipe.


Welcome Aboard est un organisme de production et de distribution cinématographique créé par Stéphanie Demers-Hébert et Valentin Verrier en Septembre 2015. Forever! Or Almost... est son second projet de production, précédé par le court-métrage Notre histoire, réalisé par Romain Ebran en 2015. En parallèle, Welcome Aboard se charge de la distribution de projets tel que le court-métrage Contretemps, réalisé par Claire Bottalico.
Nous sommes également soutenus par Aino Creation Studio qui réalisera les effets visuels et le générique de fin du film!




Pourquoi nous aider ? (Why help us?)
Votre impact est concret et va nous être très utile.
En effet, nous avons besoin de financement principalement pour la location du matériel technique, pour l'achat des accessoires, des costumes et des décors, ainsi que les autres frais relatifs à la nourriture, aux transports, aux droits musicaux etc.
Notre projet est ambitieux : l'histoire se déploie dans plusieurs décors publiques qu'ils soient extérieurs ou intérieurs qui demandent des permis et autorisations. Nous sommes très conscients du fait qu'un tel projet demande un investissement important et des moyens conséquents. Votre aide financière nous permettra de concrétiser nos intentions afin de donner le meilleur résultat possible.
En contribuant, vous nous permettrez donc de faire de ce projet la meilleure expérience cinématographique possible! Vous pouvez être assurés de faire une différence, chaque dollar ira directement à l'écran!

</div><div> <p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">In the interest of authenticity, this epic short will be shot in three languages: Lao, English and Spanish.  Specifically, scenes with the Lao family will be shot in Lao and scenes with the Latino family will be shot in Spanish.  Part of the challenge is there is a lack of Lao actors in Hollywood and so our director will have to work with actors and teach them how to deliver the lines in Lao.  Thankfully, Director Keodara can read, write and speak Lao fluently.  The other challenge is for Director Keodara to monitor performances of actors who are delivering the lines in Spanish as he does not speak Spanish.  Preparation will be costly as we would have to pay actors for rehearsals.  The plan is to romanized dialogue of the Lao language into English so our actors can successfully and believably deliver those lines during their performances.  </span><br/></p>
<p>The other major obstacle would be to figure out how to shoot two green screen scenes where two actors--one elderly and one minor--walk across a moving log while crossing a turbulent river.  These are major scenes in the movie and in order <span style=""background-color: initial;"">to mitigate the risk of injuries to our actors, we'd have to set aside funding and find a post-house that is willing to work with us on compositing a CGI world from Green Screen shots (actors walking across moving log) and combining it with SFX shots of practical elements of the environment (river bank, turbulent water, bridge, fog, etc.) in these two scenes.  We foresee shooting these scenes being tricky but doable; however, it has to be done right in order for it to look good.  In short, it's going to cost money. </span></p>

 In the interest of authenticity, this epic short will be shot in three languages: Lao, English and Spanish.  Specifically, scenes with the Lao family will be shot in Lao and scenes with the Latino family will be shot in Spanish.  Part of the challenge is there is a lack of Lao actors in Hollywood and so our director will have to work with actors and teach them how to deliver the lines in Lao.  Thankfully, Director Keodara can read, write and speak Lao fluently.  The other challenge is for Director Keodara to monitor performances of actors who are delivering the lines in Spanish as he does not speak Spanish.  Preparation will be costly as we would have to pay actors for rehearsals.  The plan is to romanized dialogue of the Lao language into English so our actors can successfully and believably deliver those lines during their performances.  
The other major obstacle would be to figure out how to shoot two green screen scenes where two actors--one elderly and one minor--walk across a moving log while crossing a turbulent river.  These are major scenes in the movie and in order to mitigate the risk of injuries to our actors, we'd have to set aside funding and find a post-house that is willing to work with us on compositing a CGI world from Green Screen shots (actors walking across moving log) and combining it with SFX shots of practical elements of the environment (river bank, turbulent water, bridge, fog, etc.) in these two scenes.  We foresee shooting these scenes being tricky but doable; however, it has to be done right in order for it to look good.  In short, it's going to cost money.

While her Lebanese mother & family push her to find marriage in hopes of grandchildren, Mena realizes she has been working so hard that she has not noticed how much time has passed. She has lost her spark or light within herself. Until, one day, she finds her passion within a form of dance that is not widely accepted as a professional career in her culture: belly dancing. But how long can Mena keep up this double life? If her secret gets out, her family will be shocked and embarrassed. Will she lose her job? Will she have to give up the one thing that has re-connected her to herself?

Tarab's Impact

Our goal is to inspire others to find their own path in life by telling a powerful story with heart and humor that stems from a place of truth.


One of the recurring themes in our story is 'Acceptance.' Acceptance of other's differences is crucial, especially in our increasingly polarized society. TARAB  sheds light on Middle Eastern culture, and, specifically, Lebanese Maronite culture, in new and enlightening ways, which the film world has not seen popularized in this way before.  It shows Mena's struggle to gain acceptance from her family, co-workers & society for being a woman who is not only a lawyer, but also a belly dancer who makes non-traditional choices in life.
This film champions diversity and will help change the film industry with its timely themes and  strong cultural  focus. We are proud to have a female screenwriter (Maria Nadia Michaels) and an extremely diverse cast and crew. In addition,  our lead actor is a woman and there are several other key female supporting roles (strong roles for female characters are under-represented, and, in 2015, women were paid significantly less than their male counterparts, as seen in the chart below). Middle Eastern actresses are even more under-represented (see chart below for more).

<p>Mad Mozzies Bar has been an iconic retreat for visitors to Inhambane, Praia de Barra, Mozambique. We built it with passion, the help of our loyal staff and a lifetime of savings, and so, it was with a heavy heart that we had to stand back and helplessly watch it burn down to mere cinders and ash in the early hours of October 8th, 2016.Short Summary</p>
<p>Over the last 10 years, this family-run bar and restaurant has meant many things to many people. To the local staff, it has not only been a source of livelihood for their families, but a source of enablement and hope for a brighter future. To holidaymakers, it has been a warm and vibrant setting for unforgettable memories and fun-filled nights spent with great friends. To couples, it has been a backdrop to their most intimate of vows and a witness to the start of their journey as newlyweds. To us, Andre and Ansie Greyling, it has been a labour of love and a nesting egg that we hoped to pass on to our children and grandchildren.</p>
<p>Which is why we owe it to the Mozambican community, to you and to ourselves to rebuild Mad Mozzies, so that it can continue to touch lives as it once did. We have mourned its loss, but it’s time to raise the Phoenix from the ashes and we can’t do it without your support. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are only asking for the cost of materials required to rebuild, not a penny more. The cost has been worked out based on a simple redesign of the bar to be up and running by December. Fire insurance was something we tried repeatedly to get but proved impossible.</p>
<p>​We are offering T-shirts, and a place on the wall of fame which will have the names of all the people who contributed significantly to the rebuild. We will also be giving generous contributors 3 free nights stay at Casas Delight Resort.</p>

<h3><strong>STRANGE MATTERS: RESTORATION AND COMPLETION</strong></h3>
<p><strong><u>HELP MAKE SOME FILM HISTORY WITH STRANGE MATTERS: A SUPERNATURAL MOVIE </u></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“As a kid I loved spooky movies and shows like The Outer Limits and the Twilight Zone. I  enjoyed horror comedy such as Abbott and Costello meet Frankenstein. As an adult I appreciated Hitchcock, Kubrick, Tod Browning, Fritz Lang and the gang. This movie is a tribute to all that mysterious jazz.”</i> -- Writer-director Philippe Mora</strong></p>
<p><strong>Philippe Mora has directed over 40 films in all genres. Many are now regarded as classics in their genre including COMMUNION (Scifi), THE BEAST WITHIN (horror), BROTHER CAN YOU SPARE A DIME, SWASTIKA (documentaries), MAD DOG MORGAN (historical), RETURN OF CAPTAIN INVINCIBLE (musical), ABSOLUTELY MODERN (mockumentary) and HOWLING 3 (parody).</strong></p>
<p><strong>He started filming the supernatural themed STRANGE MATTERS in 65MM in 2004 at the Frank Lloyd Wright Ennis House in Los Angeles, co-sponsored by Panavision and Eastman Kodak. Zelda Rubenstein (Poltergeist) headed the cast as Agnes Sampson, channeler extraordinaire. Thorsten Heinze, Marcel Marceau’s long time colleague, Austen Tayshus, the brilliant Australian comic, actor Jonathan Ball and Mora rounded out the main cast. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Mora plays Dr. Lovestrange, a psychiatrist treating people who believe they are famous historical figures. The going gets very weird when Lovestrange and Sampson realize these patients may be channeling the real people from a netherworld. When Zelda Rubenstein and then Jonathan Ball passed away, Mora had not finished the film although their scenes were complete.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mora, deeply saddened by his friends’ passing only recently was inspired to finish the film as a tribute to these great talents. He is hoping to crowd fund an essential remaining $9500 to restore and complete the film's score and visual effects. A prologue and epilogue will be filmed.</strong></p>
<p><strong>For fans of genre films and adventurous cinema this will prove to be a unique entry in the horror  and experimental pantheon.  One of the last films ever shot in 65MM it already acquires cult status.</strong></p>

<h3>Who Am I?</h3>
<p>My name is Abdelrehman AlHalawani, 23 years old. I'm from Jordan, And I wrote my psychological change after living abroad in Germany for one year into a universal short film, which is taking part as my graduation project at the German Jordanian University. </p>
<p>""Darb"" meaning in Arabic is Path, The life path of every single one of us. do we stick with the future offered to us, or do we seek a different one and be up to the consequences of our decisions.</p>
<p>For me I decided to seek a future I have desired, First step was to step out from the family business and follow my passion in the film production field. In September 2015 I got on my very first flight, heading to Germany. I was very interested in meeting different people in different countries in Europe, and I was amazed by the young people traveling around seeking their own future, and the responsibility they had towards their independent decisions. In these people I saw my passion in finding out what relies beyond every horizon my eyes saw. </p>
<h3><strong>The Story</strong></h3>
<p>I have started writing the story about five months ago, and translating my experience and thoughts into how the story it is now was really challenging.</p>
<p>The story is about a young Bedouin going through one of his most important coming of age decisions. After being pushed by his father's desire, he decides to step up for his own decisions, and how he acts with the consequences of his decisions while everything around him seems to fall apart.</p>
<p><strong>Logline</strong></p>
<p>A young Bedouin man on the verge of a traditional marriage. on a quest to prove him self he loses his hearing, pushing him to follow his desire in finding what life holds away from him living in the tribe.</p>
<p><strong>Synopsis</strong></p>
<p>SALEM a 20 years old Bedouin living with his small tribe in the desert along with his desire in finding what life might hold beyond the horizon. His father's desire in marrying him to AIN creates a race between his desire and reality. As a self-proving request by Ain's mother before the marriage he takes off to the desert to hunt a wolf down. On his first contact with the wolf Salem realizes that the wolf represents exactly the freedom he him self in longing for. If he takes the wolf freedom he lose his own as well. Later on a close sudden appear of the wolf Salem rushes to pull the trigger while taking couple of steps backward, he slips off a cliff and loses his hearing due the fall. Failing to accomplish his mission puts him to his first coming of age decision in following his desire. During his journey he faces the challenges of the desert and the wolf becomes his companion on his exploration. Salem finds out that after the horizon there is just another horizon waiting. shortly before giving up he is put to a close encounter with death, but Ain shows in the very moment to prevent it. Together they remain exposed to their own promising future. </p>

<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>With your contribution we will be able to cover the production expenses, as stated our budget is 9000$, Specifically it will be used to cover the expenses of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Crew a<span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>ccommodation.</span>
</li>
<li>Catering.</li>
<li>Equipment rentals.</li>
<li>Transportation.</li>
<li>Cast.</li>
<li>Props and costumes.</li>
<li>Animals and handlers.</li>
<li>International festivals submissions.</li>
</ul>

<p>We are currently applying a plan to lower some expenses of the production, for example we offered some corporate design work for the camp, so that we get a lower rate for the crew accommodation in return, so far we are standing at the rate of 30$ per crew member per night, so if we lock the crew to 20 members and we lock the shooting period to our estimated 10 days of shooting, we already have 6000$ as accommodation expenses to cover.</p>
<p>Based on the contribution we will be able to update the crew size we can cover.</p>
<p>All contributions will be used smartly to realize our film in the best way possible, and we will provide you with a specific budget breakdown.</p>
<h3>Why Fundraising?</h3>
<p>We decided to approach fundraising for many reasons. The film industry in Jordan is still growing, and it is more likely to get the financial support from investors than donors. Investors who we have approached asked for a clear and obvious placeholder for their products, having said that, our story happens in the middle of a desert in the 1930s, it wouldn't make any sense to show the characters holding mobile phones, or driving luxury cars. We decided to protect the good story we have from such investors, specially when they asked for a guaranteed financial income from a student film! </p>
<h3>Our Perks for Your Generosity</h3>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">With each </span>contribution<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> we've offered a Perk in return, from the lowest to the highest </span>contribution we will give something in return to thank you.<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> Starting from a social media shoutouts, customized </span>exclusive gifts, and all the way to covering accommodation in the desert of Wadi-Rum in Jordan. Here are couple of the items included in our Perks!</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our pre-production is getting more solid with everyday passing, and with your contribution helping us reach our goal we will be able to put our plans to action. In case we don't reach our goal in time, we will use what we have raised to still tell the world our story in the best way we can cover.</p>
<p>Our main challenges currently is the budget. Since we are filming in the Desert of Wadi Rum we need to cover first the expenses of accommodation and transportation, we have already reached an agreement with a tourists camp for the accommodation. the camp is well equipped for the production crew. If we reach our goal we will be able to work with enough crew to members to have a smoother production and we will be able to deliver the story in it's best shape.</p>
<p>In case if we don't reach our goal we will have to minimize our crew, which means more pressure on the rest of the crew and much harder time on set, and we are afraid it will affect the quality as well.

</div></div>","Who Am I?
My name is Abdelrehman AlHalawani, 23 years old. I'm from Jordan, And I wrote my psychological change after living abroad in Germany for one year into a universal short film, which is taking part as my graduation project at the German Jordanian University. 
""Darb"" meaning in Arabic is Path, The life path of every single one of us. do we stick with the future offered to us, or do we seek a different one and be up to the consequences of our decisions.
For me I decided to seek a future I have desired, First step was to step out from the family business and follow my passion in the film production field. In September 2015 I got on my very first flight, heading to Germany. I was very interested in meeting different people in different countries in Europe, and I was amazed by the young people traveling around seeking their own future, and the responsibility they had towards their independent decisions. In these people I saw my passion in finding out what relies beyond every horizon my eyes saw. 
The Story
I have started writing the story about five months ago, and translating my experience and thoughts into how the story it is now was really challenging.
The story is about a young Bedouin going through one of his most important coming of age decisions. After being pushed by his father's desire, he decides to step up for his own decisions, and how he acts with the consequences of his decisions while everything around him seems to fall apart.
Logline
A young Bedouin man on the verge of a traditional marriage. on a quest to prove him self he loses his hearing, pushing him to follow his desire in finding what life holds away from him living in the tribe.
Synopsis
SALEM a 20 years old Bedouin living with his small tribe in the desert along with his desire in finding what life might hold beyond the horizon. His father's desire in marrying him to AIN creates a race between his desire and reality. As a self-proving request by Ain's mother before the marriage he takes off to the desert to hunt a wolf down. On his first contact with the wolf Salem realizes that the wolf represents exactly the freedom he him self in longing for. If he takes the wolf freedom he lose his own as well. Later on a close sudden appear of the wolf Salem rushes to pull the trigger while taking couple of steps backward, he slips off a cliff and loses his hearing due the fall. Failing to accomplish his mission puts him to his first coming of age decision in following his desire. During his journey he faces the challenges of the desert and the wolf becomes his companion on his exploration. Salem finds out that after the horizon there is just another horizon waiting. shortly before giving up he is put to a close encounter with death, but Ain shows in the very moment to prevent it. Together they remain exposed to their own promising future.

What We Need
With your contribution we will be able to cover the production expenses, as stated our budget is 9000$, Specifically it will be used to cover the expenses of:

Crew accommodation.

Catering.
Equipment rentals.
Transportation.
Cast.
Props and costumes.
Animals and handlers.
International festivals submissions.


We are currently applying a plan to lower some expenses of the production, for example we offered some corporate design work for the camp, so that we get a lower rate for the crew accommodation in return, so far we are standing at the rate of 30$ per crew member per night, so if we lock the crew to 20 members and we lock the shooting period to our estimated 10 days of shooting, we already have 6000$ as accommodation expenses to cover.
Based on the contribution we will be able to update the crew size we can cover.
All contributions will be used smartly to realize our film in the best way possible, and we will provide you with a specific budget breakdown.
Why Fundraising?
We decided to approach fundraising for many reasons. The film industry in Jordan is still growing, and it is more likely to get the financial support from investors than donors. Investors who we have approached asked for a clear and obvious placeholder for their products, having said that, our story happens in the middle of a desert in the 1930s, it wouldn't make any sense to show the characters holding mobile phones, or driving luxury cars. We decided to protect the good story we have from such investors, specially when they asked for a guaranteed financial income from a student film! 
Our Perks for Your Generosity
With each contribution we've offered a Perk in return, from the lowest to the highest contribution we will give something in return to thank you. Starting from a social media shoutouts, customized exclusive gifts, and all the way to covering accommodation in the desert of Wadi-Rum in Jordan. Here are couple of the items included in our Perks!




 
Risks & Challenges
Our pre-production is getting more solid with everyday passing, and with your contribution helping us reach our goal we will be able to put our plans to action. In case we don't reach our goal in time, we will use what we have raised to still tell the world our story in the best way we can cover.
Our main challenges currently is the budget. Since we are filming in the Desert of Wadi Rum we need to cover first the expenses of accommodation and transportation, we have already reached an agreement with a tourists camp for the accommodation. the camp is well equipped for the production crew. If we reach our goal we will be able to work with enough crew to members to have a smoother production and we will be able to deliver the story in it's best shape.
In case if we don't reach our goal we will have to minimize our crew, which means more pressure on the rest of the crew and much harder time on set, and we are afraid it will affect the quality as well. If we exceed our goal we will use the money in post-production, music composing, sound design and color grading.
 

Low on funds? you may still help us! 
Getting more people familiar with what we are trying to achieve here will raise the chances of reaching the next possible donors, by sharing our campaign with friends and family you will help us in reaching our goal.

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">About Me</span></h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;"">I am a 22 year old student, born and bred in the East London.  I am now in my final year of my degree studying at Coventry University.  Living in London for my whole life and being from a mixed background (white and black Caribbean), I have lived amongst a diverse range of people from various cultures.  Looking back at my time in school, I got some grief for having white skin, with fellow black classmates often questioning my background as they often thought I was lying about where my family originate.  This didn’t have a detrimental effect on me, however it allowed me to understand how race and ethnicity is viewed in today’s Western culture, and that is through a very narrow lens. </span></p>
<h2>The Concept</h2>
<p>Observing events which have taken place throughout the course of the 10 years passed, I have witnessed how the issue of racial prejudice has ruined and ended the lives of those underserving on a worldwide scale.  The events of recent, which have been taking place in the United States, have been magnified by the use of social media and the emergence of mobile journalism, having an effect on social relationships and practices.  Being a Brit, I have personally been affected by events such as the brutal killing of Alton Sterling and many others, but only through the media that I am allowed access to such as the news and social media feeds.</p>
<p>My long term interest of these issues, has led to a level of engagement which has motivated me to step out of my comfort zone and go and find some facts myself.  By going to California for 6 days, I will be producing a documentary which explore the Black Lives Matter Movement as well as other racial issues in modern U.S. society.  </p>
<p>I am currently in the process of setting up interviews with individuals, including everyday citizens as well as leaders of groups such as Dignity and Power Now.  My recent contact with someone who works alongside the founder of Black Lives Matter gives me reason to believe that this project can be pulled off with consistency and resilience.  </p>
<p>My aim is to gather my own understanding and perspective of the events taking place in the U.S which work to suppress black communities, whilst making media that possesses the power of impact on it's audiences.  I believe in the ability to create and distribute stimulating media with the accessibility to today's Worldwide online networks. In going forward with the ambitious California project, I have encouraged myself to push boundaries and expectations in order to create something not only current, but relatable through my personal experiences in hope that I can educate others as well as myself by providing unfiltered access to this part of society.</p>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I want my film to be seen, interpreted and understood both here and in the States, and submission to film festivals are the perfect opportunity for this to be done.  With help from you guys as contributors to my budget, I am optimistic that your generous contributions will be able to lift my project even higher off the ground.  Your contributions will also allow me to produce a more visually pleasing piece, with the possibility of access to bigger and better shooting kit.  </p>
<p>Expenses such as travel are also included in my goal, I have raised what I can through other means but your help would really make a difference.</p>
<p>Even if the goal isn't reached, 100% of your contributions will go towards the production and distribution of this film.  You will also receive perks which you can see on the right hand side of the page.  These perks will allow more of an insight into my experience with my first independent production.  </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<h3>Director's Statement</h3>
<p>    My story is about the relationship between a young girl and God. In my story I will talk about the loss of a close one, losing faith, trusting and believing in anything around my main protagonist and reconnecting. The genre of this film is Drama/Spiritual/Faith Based. I would like the time period of this film to be current, because I think it can speak to a lot of young girls out there who have lost their dads. My protagonists goal is to get answers from God on why he would take her father away from her, especially before the big event she has been waiting for which is the Father/Daughter Dance at her school. This film will try to aim more towards being all action and less or no Dialogue. </p>
<p>    The Theme in my film is Hope. When you read books/ the Bible on God you learn that God is Love and the greatest thing to have is Love or else nothing else matters. The other theme in this story is family relationships, specifically between a Father and Daughter. The subtext of the film or scenes in the film really boil down to anger, loss of identity and self and loss of faith in God.  </p>
<p>    Visually I want the performance’s and look to be very realistic and more focused on emotion’s and bringing the inner thoughts and actions to life. This film, will have neutral to dark grey tones throughout the film, because I want the audience to actually feel and see the space and what has changed in the characters life. For my music and sound, I want movement’s and wild sounds from what you are seeing in the film. I want musical instruments to play in the backgrounds when we show a sad part of the film such as the violin. I really want to capture the emotional state of both my protagonist and her mother during this film.     </p>

For us Lithuanians, the fact that so many Litvaks currently live in South Africa is largely unknown. In the meantime, South African Litvaks still remember their homeland and hold on to old photos of wooden synagogues in their hometowns, portraits of their grandparents, and stories that have been passed down through generations. In this documentary, we want to include Robert (Ruvel) Videtzky. He is 93 years old and is one of a very few Litvaks who can recall, and share  their journey from Lithuania to South Africa.Original image: Molėtų krašto muziejusDuring almost a century, Litvaks successfully established themselves in South Africa. Some of them became well known in the arts or business worlds, others immersed into the political one, including fighting apartheid. While aforementioned Robert and others from his generation have memories of Lithuania or Lita, as it was called back then, their sons and daughters are actively exploring this Baltic country as it is now and its history. Original image: Molėtų krašto muziejusThe vibrant Litvak community in South Africa finds its ways to cherish bonds with Lithuania. But what will the future unfold? Will the young generation be interested in their grandparents’ homeland? What does Lithuania mean for them?Original image: Molėtų krašto muziejusThis documentary strives to answer all these questions and more, by giving a platform to the Litvak community in South Africa, to tell their story. Personal recounts and anecdotes will paint a tragedy - the Holocaust and war - yet hopeful - the new life in South Africa - picture of this part of the Lithuanian Jews’ history.Jewish history is Lithuanian history. It looks like only now this phase is becoming common. Filming the ""march of the living ones"", the 75th Anniversary of Massacre of Jews in Molėtai, showed the concern and memory we have about our past. Litvaks from all over the world came to the march, many Lithuanians joined.Our documentary is one more step towards a better understanding of our history, Litvaks being a part of it. Moreover, we aim to answer questions of today and tomorrow – how is the Litvaks community in SA doing nowadays? What bonds are left? Why some of them come to search for their roots, while others object even to talk about it?Finally, we believe this documentary will contribute with better relation of Lithuania and the Republic of South Africa – countries that have so much to share together.Now you have a chance to make this impact by contributing to the project.Original image: Molėtų krašto muziejusThe first challenge we faced is finding more information about the topic of the documentary, especially the one presented in a non-academic, narrative way. This led us to decide that  a documentary is the best way to tell the story.Now the main obstacle is a plain geographical one. After one year of researching, reading, writing emails and meeting people, we feel prepared to get out on the field with our project. But almost 9000 kilometers between Vilnius and Johannesburg means we cannot simply go shoot around for the weekend. We intend on spending three weeks in South Africa, were we will meet everyone we Skyped at their place of residence.We are going to use all Indiegogo funding, directly, for the production of the movie. Our goal is the minimum sum that is enough to make the documentary. We are searching for other sponsors and partners, so even if we do not reach our goal of €23 000, we can use your donations and make it happen. Moreover, your support means public interest, and that allows us to apply for funds more successfully. You can see all our exclusive perks on your right. Would you like something else in exchange for your support?

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>We all have had times where we feel like giving up when things begin to get too hard and domino effects of bad circumstances happen. There are times where we feel we have to rethink our life and career goals based on feeling letting down or afraid of whether or not we will make it to where we want to be. </p>
<p>The Good Life touches these feelings as we immerse ourselves in the story of Craig, an ex-nascar driver of the 70's struggling to feel passionate about anything since his career failure and divorce, and Haley, a spunky teenager who won't let anyone put her passions of roller dancing down and will do what it takes to make her dreams happen. We watch as she struggles to convince her uncle to partake in being her guardian in order to make her dream come true and ultimately watch him become inspired by her strength and will towards something she really loves. </p>

<p><strong>Brittany Porter </strong>is a student finishing up her last year at the Art Institute of CA - Hollywood working towards a degree in Digital Cinema &amp; Video Production. She grew up always knowing that she wanted to pursue a career within the entertainment industry, but it wasn't until she reached high school and watched her first Stanley Kubrick film, that she realized her heart gravitated towards film and design. Throughout the last 3 years, she has focused on making each project the best it can be all while continuously strengthening her skills within the art department. In the last year she has been able to freelance as a production designer of many short films, a web series, and is currently designing her second feature as well as set dressing and lending a helping art hand wherever needed. The Good Life will not only present her ability to direct a more narrative short film aside from her past experimental shorts, but also give her the ability to bring together another amazing crew who can be proud of the entire ending product.  </p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Plan</h3>
<p>Principle photography begins at the beginning of December, dates and locations are locked and we are currently in the auditioning process. </p>
<p>The budget for The Good Life is mainly divided into 5 categories:<i> Locations, Rentals, Production Design, Crew and of coarse, Food!</i></p>
<p><strong>Locations: </strong>Locations have been locked and we have found beautiful places that fit the 1970's feeling from a house built during the 1960's and a roller rink that has the right disco vibes.</p>
<p><strong>Rentals: </strong>Rentals include any equipment we will need to rent additional to what the school already provides. To keep the roller rink scene safe, we plan to do this with a steadicam and already have the perfect steadicam op.!</p>
<p><strong>Production Design: </strong>The 1970's, yes, period piece. Locations are ready to be dressed and we've been scoping out swap meets and thrift stores for the perfect vintage finds at a deal. Our 1970s race car will come at a cost and specific period piece items and clothing still need help in contributions. Let's bring this 1970's rollerskate / race car dream to life. </p>
<p><strong>Crew: </strong> As a group of creatives, we have all helped each other in some way in each of our own graduating films and outside projects, so we have a large number of us who are excited and dedicated to bring this story to life at little cost and with passion in order to make something great for each of our portfolios. We do have outside talent/crew budgeted here, such as those bringing their own kits and a roller skate dancing double for the rink.</p>
<p><strong>Food: </strong>4 long days and a group of talent and crew need their fuel to make this short film the best it can be.  </p>

<p>Pierre Rehov, an independent producer and director that has set out to expose the propaganda machine behind the fake news that you see every day on your television, in magazines or newspapers. </p>
<p>For over 10 years, since the uprising of the second Intifada, Pierre Rehov has set out to debunk most of the mythologies which poison the political situation of the Middle East. While a large majority of international media correspondents are in a situation which does not allow them to tell the truth about the Israeli-Arab conflict.</p>In the words of Michael Margolies of the New York Press ""If you're tired of the New York Times-NPR Slant on Israel and the Palestinians, here's good news: documentary filmmaker Pierre Rehov has been challenging prevailing myths since 2001. With ten films already to his credit and another on the way, this serious, never boring, and above all else courageous documentarian is starting to make some serious waves""<p>Renowned author Phillys Chestler, once called him <a href=""http://pajamasmedia.com/phyllischesler/2009/04/01/pierre-rehov-the-lion-in-exile/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">"" A lion in exile ""</a>. Although, he does not feel as being in exile anymore... since he made alyia to Israel !</p>
<h3>Temple Mount</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1477807217/ttb4nt9llqdgunsz80nm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Recently, under the pressure of Arab dictatorships, and despite the advice of many world leaders, UNESCO has come with a resolution denying all connection between the Jewish People and Jerusalem, and mostly between the Jewish People, the Christians, and Temple Mount, which appears in this resolution only under its Muslim name : al-Ḥaram aš-Šarīf ( The noble Sanctuary ). The same goes with the Wailing Wall, the holiest place on earth for Jews, to which UNESCO referred only according to Muslim mythology (Mohammad is said to have attached his horse to the wall, before flying to heaven...)</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1477808277/cibckc47a6qj1yrkqxvy.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>While Jerusalem appears more than 700 times in the Bible, the name of the city doesn't appear even once in the Quran. It’s a disgrace to UNESCO and all the countries which voted for the resolution or abstained (shame on Europe, except for Germany and England), and it is a deplorable decision that is over-politicized, while ignoring historical and archaeological facts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It is time to tell the truth in its historical context, about Temple Mount. This is a disgrace to anybody who thinks of themselves as a civilized, intelligent person. The contributions that we will receive shall go into making an elaborate documentary film on this touching matter. The true story of Temple Mount will be expressly unveiled and made available to the public this way.</p>
<p>Our goal is also to use the donations to massively promote the film to reach greater audience. It should be seen by at least ONE MILLION VIEWERS.</p>
<h3>What we need</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1477783343/ikvwd65uuwriyiwuwpuk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Your contribution will go towards completing the documentary explain the integral facts about the Temple Mount. This will establish the truth, once and for all and make it a point of historical reference. It will serve to educate the ignorant and those swayed by the politicised news reports.</p>
<p>We need funds at different levels:</p>
<ul>
<li>To create the documentary film on the Temple Mount</li>
<li>To successfully produce and finish the film</li>
<li>To upload the film on social media ( Youtube, Vimeo, Dailymotion, Facebook etc... )</li>
<li>To renounce seeing any royalties in the future ( which represents a loss of $15,000 a year )</li>
<li>To promote the uploads through the same systems (buying clicks, uploading banners... )</li>
<li>Massive online publicity</li>
</ul>
<p>We need $45,000 for this feat to be achieved and successfully executed. Our plan is ready and the production unit are all on standby to start on it. All we need is the donation. This is not our first, we have done similar ones in the past with massive success record. You can see the testimonial section or our site for this ( <a href=""http://www.middleeaststudio.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.MiddleEastStudio.com</a>).</p>

</div></div>","Who is the director ?

Pierre Rehov, an independent producer and director that has set out to expose the propaganda machine behind the fake news that you see every day on your television, in magazines or newspapers. 
For over 10 years, since the uprising of the second Intifada, Pierre Rehov has set out to debunk most of the mythologies which poison the political situation of the Middle East. While a large majority of international media correspondents are in a situation which does not allow them to tell the truth about the Israeli-Arab conflict.In the words of Michael Margolies of the New York Press ""If you're tired of the New York Times-NPR Slant on Israel and the Palestinians, here's good news: documentary filmmaker Pierre Rehov has been challenging prevailing myths since 2001. With ten films already to his credit and another on the way, this serious, never boring, and above all else courageous documentarian is starting to make some serious waves""Renowned author Phillys Chestler, once called him "" A lion in exile "". Although, he does not feel as being in exile anymore... since he made alyia to Israel !
Temple Mount

Recently, under the pressure of Arab dictatorships, and despite the advice of many world leaders, UNESCO has come with a resolution denying all connection between the Jewish People and Jerusalem, and mostly between the Jewish People, the Christians, and Temple Mount, which appears in this resolution only under its Muslim name : al-Ḥaram aš-Šarīf ( The noble Sanctuary ). The same goes with the Wailing Wall, the holiest place on earth for Jews, to which UNESCO referred only according to Muslim mythology (Mohammad is said to have attached his horse to the wall, before flying to heaven...)

While Jerusalem appears more than 700 times in the Bible, the name of the city doesn't appear even once in the Quran. It’s a disgrace to UNESCO and all the countries which voted for the resolution or abstained (shame on Europe, except for Germany and England), and it is a deplorable decision that is over-politicized, while ignoring historical and archaeological facts.
 
It is time to tell the truth in its historical context, about Temple Mount. This is a disgrace to anybody who thinks of themselves as a civilized, intelligent person. The contributions that we will receive shall go into making an elaborate documentary film on this touching matter. The true story of Temple Mount will be expressly unveiled and made available to the public this way.
Our goal is also to use the donations to massively promote the film to reach greater audience. It should be seen by at least ONE MILLION VIEWERS.
What we need

Your contribution will go towards completing the documentary explain the integral facts about the Temple Mount. This will establish the truth, once and for all and make it a point of historical reference. It will serve to educate the ignorant and those swayed by the politicised news reports.
We need funds at different levels:

To create the documentary film on the Temple Mount
To successfully produce and finish the film
To upload the film on social media ( Youtube, Vimeo, Dailymotion, Facebook etc... )
To renounce seeing any royalties in the future ( which represents a loss of $15,000 a year )
To promote the uploads through the same systems (buying clicks, uploading banners... )
Massive online publicity

We need $45,000 for this feat to be achieved and successfully executed. Our plan is ready and the production unit are all on standby to start on it. All we need is the donation. This is not our first, we have done similar ones in the past with massive success record. You can see the testimonial section or our site for this ( www.MiddleEastStudio.com).

Why support us


 

You support the truth
You want people to know the truth
You hate political news manipulations
You want our voice heard

“The most shocking moments of Rehov’s films involves blatant Palestinian efforts to manipulate the media” –Hanna Brown, Jerusalem Post

Risks & Challenges


Unfortunately, with almost NO TV NETWORK outside Israel, accepting to air our films, due to political correctness, pro-Arab views, fear of terrorism, or, simply, amateurism and lack of knowledge, we have resorted to taking the bull by the horn in our little way. Tiny drops makes the ocean. We host our films on various media where the general public can access it easily (Youtube, Vimeo, Dailymotion, Facebook etc).

Other Ways You Can Help

Some people just can’t contribute financially, but that doesn’t mean they can’t help. So even if you love this idea but lack the resources to pledge to its success, there are some other ways you can use to ensure this.

<h3><i><strong>What is Secret?</strong></i></h3>
<p>Secret is an 18 minute short film that was written by Cesa Pledger. Nicola and Kimi are each struggling with the loss of a parent. Nicola is watching her mother, Cheryl, slowly die from dementia; Cheryl is only 66 years old. Kimi also lost both of her parents a few years ago. She recently decided to look for answers to her unresolved questions about her family. Both women find it very difficult to connect with anyone during this time. As their paths collide, perhaps they will be able to connect to each other.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong><i>Origins</i></strong></h3>
<p>Secret is a film written by Cesa Pledger about her own experience with her father as he died slowly from a form of dementia at the same age of 66. During this time, Cesa had to go through her father's belongings and decide which items to keep. While looking through old pictures, she began to wonder about how much she knew about her father. Cesa wants to share her story of the last six months with her father. While it was heart-wrenching, it was beautiful, healing, and therapeutic for her. </p>

<div>While the project itself will cost over £1000 to produce we already have over half the money for this project.

<div>We would love to offer more, like T-Shirts, DVDs/Blu rays etc but we just don't have the money to produce those, if we did we wouldn't need your help.

What We Need & What You Get
 We've completed all of the Character Audio Work. Right now, we need money for:


PRODUCTION: Building Sets, Creating all of the Felt Characters, Paying Cast and Crew stipends for lending us their many talents. (80% of this budget goes back directly to the Cast & Crew - 69%  Crew & 11% to The Actors) 
 
POST PRODUCTION: funds are needed to Edit, create all of the many Sound EFX, and Music 
DISTRIBUTION: Our plan is to  rent  the Crest Theatre here in Sacramento, CA. The Crest has been a film icon in our community for years. Many film festivals take place in this restored Art Deco venue.    The Impact To all of us working on this project, this is more than simply ""a film.""  It provides paid work experience in the film industry to the disabled students working at DDSO-Employment Plus 10 Years of Success with ""Josh's Journal"", the web series. Episodes have been screened multiple years at the Sacramento ComicCon. Through this project, we are helping to build/promote the local growing film industry. Sacramento is making films!!!

There where some american co-producers on the horizon for a moment, but as soon as we found out their lack of sensitivity to  the animals and as we learned of their plans to make  this documentary a commercially easy-buck product, we decided to pull out of the deal. We choosed to finance the film with our means and by doing so we maintained final cut rights and complete creative control.</p><p>To try and describe Samadhi using words is a difficult task, but we'll try anyway. Samadhi is a documentary about animals that is different from the ones we are used to watch. You will not drown in a sea of information and fact, you will not find out about the working habits of the green ant or learn anything about the mating rituals of baboons. Samadhi stands out from other documentaries, it will make you experience seven stories of love and friendship between humans and animals, filmed as we traveled around the world.</p><p>You will discover that there are no barriers between “us” humans and “them” the animals, the only barriers you will find are those we humans have invented.</p><p>We have made this film to sensitize the human cosciousness even more towards animals and their cause. Samadhi shows and highlights the amazing capacity that these creatures have to love, rather than concetrate on their suffering as many other documentaries sharing our cause do. </p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Tatiana Schneider and her wolf pack in Germany.</b></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1471697016/cartolina_lupi_uqx7jq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Sholeh and Mulan the tiger in Indonesia.</b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1471697054/Cartolina_tigre_m1qtf3.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><b>The french bulldog Meo and his family in Grosseto, Italy. </b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1471697106/cartolina_cane_xgi5wa.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><b>The orangutans of Borneo and their babysitters of the BOS Foundation.</b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1471697154/cartolina_oranghi_busijp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Stefanie Stöcker and and her two horses Björn and Menor in Germany.</b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1471705121/cavalli_nckvt0.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Fadjen the corrida bull and his savior Christophe in France.</b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1471697219/cartolina_toro_ztx6cs.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><b>The enchantment of Herbert and his marmot friend Moritz on the highest mountain of Austria. </b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1471697263/Cartolina_herbert_dltovr.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>_________________________________________________________________________</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1471702153/WHY_THE_CROWDFUNDING_hgez5l.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p>We have invested our savings, we have managed to complete the filming and we have achieved a first cut.

<p><i>Schau ihnen in die Augen und versuche zu sagen, dass sie keine Seele haben</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><i>- Victor Hugo</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Der Film wurde fast ausschließlich von uns finanziert. Wir hatten eine Zeit lang amerikanische Koproduzenten, aber wir haben uns von ihnen getrennt, als uns klar wurde, dass sie nicht nur unfähig waren, die Liebe der Tiere zu verstehen, sondern auch dem Film schaden würden, denn ihr Ziel war nur ein Produkt für den schnellen Gewinn. So beschlossen wir, den Film allein zu finanzieren, um die volle Kontrolle über die kreative Gestaltung zu behalten.</p>
<p>“Samadhi – We Are One” mit Worten zu beschreiben, ist nicht leicht, aber wir versuchen es trotzdem.</p>
<p>Samadhi ist ein Dokumentarfilm über und für Tiere, der anders ist als gewöhnliche Dokumentarfilme. Sie, die Zuschauer, werden darin nicht von einer Flut von Wissen überschwemmt, nichts über die Arbeitsteilung der grünen Ameisen oder die Paarungsrituale der Rundschwanzseekühe erfahren.</p>
<p>Samadhi unterscheidet sich von einer rein informativen Dokumentation, denn er zeigt lebendig sieben zauberhafte Geschichten von Freundschaft und Liebe zwischen Mensch und Tier, die auf Reisen in Asien und Europa aufgenommen wurden.</p>
<p>Sie nehmen teil an bewegenden und vergnüglichen, manchmal auch traurigen Erfahrungen.</p>
<p>Sie entdecken, dass es zwischen uns Menschen und den Tieren keine Schranken gibt außer denen, die wir erfunden haben.</p>
<p><b>Wir haben diesen Film gedreht, um das Bewusstsein der Menschen für die Tiere und ihre Sache stärker zu sensibilisieren.</b></p>
<p><b>Anders als andere Filme mit ähnlichen Zielen zeigt Samadhi </b><b>nicht nur das Leiden dieser Geschöpfe, sondern setzt den Schwerpunkt auf ihre außerordentliche Fähigkeit zu lieben.</b></p>

<p>Mit unseren Ersparnissen konnten wir alle Aufnahmen drehen und eine Rohfassung schneiden. Bevor der Dokumentarfilm öffentlich gezeigt werden kann, ist allerdings noch viel Arbeit zu tun, und dafür reichen unsere Mittel nicht mehr aus. Deshalb bitten wir Sie um Hilfe. Mit Ihrem Beitrag können wir den Film vollenden, damit er in der ganzen Welt in seiner ganzen Schönheit aufgeführt werden kann.</p>
<p>Mit Ihrer Hilfe können wir:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>eine Endfassung schneiden</p></li>
<li><p>die Voice Actors bezahlen und die Stimmen aufnehmen</p></li>
<li><p>die Rechte für die im Film verwendeten Musiktitel erwerben</p></li>
<li><p>die Audio-Endfassung mischen</p></li>
<li><p>das Color Grading vollenden</p></li>
<li><p>die DCP-Kopien für die Projektionen erstellen</p></li>
<li><p>das Design für das Filmplakat und die DVD entwerfen</p></li>
</ul> <p>Wenn eine Spende für Sie nicht möglich ist, Sie uns aber trotzdem helfen wollen, leiten Sie diese Crowdfunding-Kampagne weiter! Ein Sharing über Ihre Social Networks ist viel stärker und effizienter als Sie sich vorstellen können!</p>
<p><b>Und wenn wir die erforderliche Summe nicht erreichen? Oder sie überschreiten?</b></p>
<p>Das Budget, um den Film zu vollenden, ist relativ flexibel. Die 225.000 Euro brutto, die wir anstreben, sind der Betrag, mit dem der Film unter Verzicht auf alles verzichtbare, aber ohne Abstriche an der Qualität beendet werden kann. Wenn Ihre Beiträge nicht diese Höhe erreichen sollten, sind wir gezwungen, an allen Bearbeitungen der Postproduktion zu sparen. </p>
<p>Im wunderbaren Fall, dass wir mehr sammeln, wird der ganze Betrag ausschließlich in den Dokumentarfilm investiert: Wir könnten dann Rechte für Musikstücke erwerben, die sonst zu teuer wären, oder in Stimmen von bedeutenden Schauspielern investieren. Zusätzliche Beiträge helfen uns auch, wenn es um den Vertrieb geht, so dass der Film mehr Aufmerksamkeit erhält!</p>

<p>Angesichts des kleinen Teams und des enormen Projekts musste wir alle das Äußerste geben, um die Aufnahmen zum Abschluss zu bringen. Alle Teammitglieder wurden nicht nur wegen ihrer technischen Begabung, sondern auch ihrer Tierliebe gewählt. Und deshalb ist unserer Meinung nach das Wunder geschehen: Die Tiere haben das erfasst, haben uns mit ihrer Spontanität überrascht und beschenkt und so ihren größten Beitrag geleistet. Sie wurden selbst Teil des Teams!</p> <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1472323306/VICTOR_TOGNOLA_qfztzo.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""> “<i>Mira a tu perro a los ojos y no podrás afirmar que no tiene alma” </i></p>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><i>- Victor Hugo</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>La película la hemos financiado nosotros mismos, casi en su totalidad. Durante un cierto período, pudimos contar también con unos co-productores americanos, de los cuales decidimos liberarnos, al darnos cuenta de que no solamente eran incapaces de comprender el amor de los animales, sino que también habrían perjudicado la película, imponiéndonos sus decisiones con el fin de obtener un producto de fácil ganancia. Por esta razón, decidimos financiar la película nosotros solos, para mantener y tutelar un total control creativo.</p>
<p>Describir con palabras <i>Samadhi – We Are One</i> es tarea algo difícil, pero lo intentaremos.</p>
<p><i>Samadhi</i> es un documental sobre y dedicado a los animales diferente de los que se suelen ver. Viéndolo, no tendréis la sensación de quedar arrollados por un mar de nociones, ni descubriréis la organización del trabajo de las hormigas verdes, ni los rituales de apareamiento de los manatíes.</p>
<p><i>Samadhi</i> se aparta de los acostumbrados documentales de género informativo, haciendo vivir siete mágicas historias de amistad y cariño entre humanos y animales, rodadas viajando entre Asia y Europa.</p>
<p>Os sorprenderá una experiencia que, a veces, logra ser conmovedora y divertida, mientras que otras veces infunde algo de tristeza.</p>
<p>Descubriréis que entre nosotros y los animales las únicas barreras que existen son las que nosotros mismos hemos inventado.  </p>
<p><b>Hemos rodado este documental con el objetivo de difundir una mayor concienciación sobre los animales y su causa. </b></p>
<p><b>Al contrario de otros vídeos cuyos objetivos eran los mismos que los nuestros, </b><i><b>Samadhi </b></i><b>no solamente expone el sufrimiento que sienten estas criaturas, sino que pone en evidencia su extraordinaria capacidad de amar. </b></p>

<p>Con nuestros ahorros hemos podido llevar a cabo las tomas y realizar un primer montaje. Queda todavía mucho trabajo por hacer, antes de que el documental esté listo para lanzarlo al público, y nuestros fondos no son suficientes. Por eso os pedimos ayuda. Con vuestros aportes podremos terminar la película, para poder mostrar todo su esplendor al mundo entero.  </p>
<p>Gracias a vuestra ayuda conseguiremos lo siguiente:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Llegar al montaje definitivo</p></li>
<li><p>Pagar los honorarios de los actores de voz y grabar sus voces</p></li>
<li><p>Pagar derechos por la utilización de las músicas usadas en el documental</p></li>
<li><p>Preparar las mezclas de audio definitivas</p></li>
<li><p>Perfeccionar el etalonaje</p></li>
<li><p>Grabar en formato DCP para las proyecciones</p></li>
<li><p>Crear un diseño para el póster cinematográfico y para el DVD</p></li>

<p><b>¿Y si no se alcanzara la cifra pedida? ¿Y en caso de que se superara tal cifra?</b></p>
<p>El presupuesto para poder terminar la película es relativamente flexible. Los 225.000 euros contados en bruto que pedimos, suponen lo suficiente para terminar la película, renunciando a todo lo que se pueda renunciar, pero sin que melle su calidad. En caso de que vuestros aportes no llegaran a esta cifra, nos veríamos obligados a tener que ahorrar en todas las labores de post-producción. En el caso maravilloso de que superáramos tal cifra, todo quedaría invertido sólo y exclusivamente en el documental: podríamos, por ejemplo, adquirir derechos por las músicas, que son demasiado caras, o invertir en voces de actores conocidos. Además, los aportes complementarios nos ayudarían también a la hora de distribuir el documental, dándole aún más visibilidad. </p>

</div></div>","_________________________________________________________________________ “Look into their eyes and try and tell me that they don't have a soul”- Victor Hugo We have financed this film almost completely by ourselves. There where some american co-producers on the horizon for a moment, but as soon as we found out their lack of sensitivity to  the animals and as we learned of their plans to make  this documentary a commercially easy-buck product, we decided to pull out of the deal. We choosed to finance the film with our means and by doing so we maintained final cut rights and complete creative control.To try and describe Samadhi using words is a difficult task, but we'll try anyway. Samadhi is a documentary about animals that is different from the ones we are used to watch. You will not drown in a sea of information and fact, you will not find out about the working habits of the green ant or learn anything about the mating rituals of baboons. Samadhi stands out from other documentaries, it will make you experience seven stories of love and friendship between humans and animals, filmed as we traveled around the world.You will discover that there are no barriers between “us” humans and “them” the animals, the only barriers you will find are those we humans have invented.We have made this film to sensitize the human cosciousness even more towards animals and their cause. Samadhi shows and highlights the amazing capacity that these creatures have to love, rather than concetrate on their suffering as many other documentaries sharing our cause do.  Tatiana Schneider and her wolf pack in Germany.  Sholeh and Mulan the tiger in Indonesia. The french bulldog Meo and his family in Grosseto, Italy.  The orangutans of Borneo and their babysitters of the BOS Foundation. Stefanie Stöcker and and her two horses Björn and Menor in Germany. Fadjen the corrida bull and his savior Christophe in France. The enchantment of Herbert and his marmot friend Moritz on the highest mountain of Austria. _________________________________________________________________________ We have invested our savings, we have managed to complete the filming and we have achieved a first cut. There is still a lot of work to be done on the film before it can be presented to the public and unfortunately we have exhausted our funds.For this reason we ask for your help, with your contribution we'll be able to perfectly finalize our film, so that the whole world will be able to see it in all of its splendour.With your help we'll be able to:reach a final cutpay the voice-over actors and record their voicesfinance the copyright of the music we use in the filmprepare and finalize the definite Audio Mixfinalize the color gradingMaster in DCP for projectionsfinance the design and creation of a movie poster and a DVD coverIf you can't afford to make a donation but you would still like to help us: share this crowdfunding campaign with your contacts and friends. A share on your favourite social network is more powerful and effective than you think! What if we don't reach our goal? What if we outdo our goal?The budget we need to finalize this film is quite flexible. The 225'000 euro that we ask are what is basically needed to finish the film, leaving behind what can be left behind, saving money where it's possible. In case we will not reach our goal, then we'll have to save money on all of the post-production workings. In the wonderful case your contribution will outdo our goal we can assure you that every penny will be invested in the film, making it great, for example by buying the copyright for music that at the moment we can't afford, or investing on the cost of a voice-over made by a famous actor, etc.Extra contributions would be very helpful for distribution and marketing of the film, giving it a real chance of being seen across the planet._________________________________________________________________________ A small crew for a big project, everyone of us has given 150% of their energy in order to complete the filming. Each crew member has been carefully selected on the base of his or her love and understanding of animals and of course for his or her professional qualities.This is one of the reasons, we believe, that allowed the animals to be so spontaneous. They have managed to surprise and amaze us by doing incredible things in front of the camera.Some kind of a miracle, they became part of the crew.  Victor Tognola is the director Samadhi. A film maker that in his long careeer has directed more than 3000 commercials, won many prizes, like the Grand Prix along with 12 lions at the Cannes Int. Advertising Film Festival and a Grand Award at the New York International Film & TV Festival.In 1984 he directed the movie ”Illusione” which was presented with great critical acclaim at the Venice Film Festival in Italy and at the International Film Festival of Karlovy Vary in the former republic of Yugoslavia.He also wrote and then directed the cartoon Tv series “The world's most beautiful tales” ( 52 episodes based on Aesop's tales) and the cartoon Tv series ”Clorophyll from the blue sky” drawn by Adelchi Galloni (based on an ecological science fiction story, 10 episodes)More recently he has directed numerous documentaries based on anthropological research and on the collective memory. Anne-Marie Rodeghiero represents our best, she has learned the producer profession at Frama Films. Her professional journey has started in the world of advertising spot production, a very hard school. She has later worked on many Frama Films productions; Mysterious Switzerland (for Swiss national television), Erich Maria Remarque, Paulette Goddard and Marlene Dietrich: a love triangle (Moscow International Film Festival), Schmidhauser ( Locarno Film Festival) just to mention a few.On Samadhi she has also contributed creatively partecipating as co-author.     Marc Bachmann is our cinematographer. He has started his career as a photographer, for advertising. In 1996 he published works on his travels to the USA and central America and reportages on the world of Music and business in Switzerland. Since 2011 he is a free lance cameraman, director of photography and cinematographer for advertising and documentary film production. He has worked for SVV, the Spick Magazine, Tierwelt, ZSGE foundation, IWC, Upc Cablecom, Simon Steuri, Myriam Zumbühl and many more.    Riccardo Nasoni is the editor of Samadhi – We are One. Unlike many of his colleagues, Riccardo's work already takes place during the filming, working on the set, in order to have a better understanding of what is being produced.He has studied at the D.A.M.S. - University in Bologna, Italy, he has been the president of AMI Associazione montatori italiani (Italian Editor Association) (2009-2014) and an editing tutor for Mediaset - Italia 1.   Misha is the eldest son of Victor. He has a diploma in Art and technique of film making attained at the London Film School. He has worked with artist Klaus Gorges on the Solart Project in Big Sur, USA. Misha has directed many commercials and two documentaries : “Ivan Bianchi Pioneer of Photography at the Czar's court” and “Living in the Biosphere”. He has created and directed infotainment and music programs for Swiss National radio and television. He has taught “directing” and “creativity in advertising” classes at the SAE institute in Zurich, Switzerland. Misha has participated creatively to most of Frama Fiilm productions, as he did on SAMADHI.  Son of Victor Tognola, like his brother Misha could since childhood participate on his father's productions. He has worked on Samadhi - We are One as camera assistant on the set and as creative consultant during the editing and post-production, he has created this crowdfunding campaign and this year he will start studying film at the prestigious Zürcher Hochschule der Künste.   Officially Ministry of Home Security, for this film Artù assumed the role of ethologist, making it possible for us to understand many things about animals. His love was, and still is, one of the main sources of inspiration in making Samadhi.

He receives a series of international prizes, among them the “Palm d'or” at the Cannes International Advertising Film Festival.

Schau ihnen in die Augen und versuche zu sagen, dass sie keine Seele haben
- Victor Hugo
 
Der Film wurde fast ausschließlich von uns finanziert. Wir hatten eine Zeit lang amerikanische Koproduzenten, aber wir haben uns von ihnen getrennt, als uns klar wurde, dass sie nicht nur unfähig waren, die Liebe der Tiere zu verstehen, sondern auch dem Film schaden würden, denn ihr Ziel war nur ein Produkt für den schnellen Gewinn. So beschlossen wir, den Film allein zu finanzieren, um die volle Kontrolle über die kreative Gestaltung zu behalten.
“Samadhi – We Are One” mit Worten zu beschreiben, ist nicht leicht, aber wir versuchen es trotzdem.
Samadhi ist ein Dokumentarfilm über und für Tiere, der anders ist als gewöhnliche Dokumentarfilme. Sie, die Zuschauer, werden darin nicht von einer Flut von Wissen überschwemmt, nichts über die Arbeitsteilung der grünen Ameisen oder die Paarungsrituale der Rundschwanzseekühe erfahren.
Samadhi unterscheidet sich von einer rein informativen Dokumentation, denn er zeigt lebendig sieben zauberhafte Geschichten von Freundschaft und Liebe zwischen Mensch und Tier, die auf Reisen in Asien und Europa aufgenommen wurden.
Sie nehmen teil an bewegenden und vergnüglichen, manchmal auch traurigen Erfahrungen.
Sie entdecken, dass es zwischen uns Menschen und den Tieren keine Schranken gibt außer denen, die wir erfunden haben.
Wir haben diesen Film gedreht, um das Bewusstsein der Menschen für die Tiere und ihre Sache stärker zu sensibilisieren.
Anders als andere Filme mit ähnlichen Zielen zeigt Samadhi nicht nur das Leiden dieser Geschöpfe, sondern setzt den Schwerpunkt auf ihre außerordentliche Fähigkeit zu lieben.

Mit unseren Ersparnissen konnten wir alle Aufnahmen drehen und eine Rohfassung schneiden. Bevor der Dokumentarfilm öffentlich gezeigt werden kann, ist allerdings noch viel Arbeit zu tun, und dafür reichen unsere Mittel nicht mehr aus. Deshalb bitten wir Sie um Hilfe. Mit Ihrem Beitrag können wir den Film vollenden, damit er in der ganzen Welt in seiner ganzen Schönheit aufgeführt werden kann.
Mit Ihrer Hilfe können wir:

eine Endfassung schneiden
die Voice Actors bezahlen und die Stimmen aufnehmen
die Rechte für die im Film verwendeten Musiktitel erwerben
die Audio-Endfassung mischen
das Color Grading vollenden
die DCP-Kopien für die Projektionen erstellen
das Design für das Filmplakat und die DVD entwerfen
 Wenn eine Spende für Sie nicht möglich ist, Sie uns aber trotzdem helfen wollen, leiten Sie diese Crowdfunding-Kampagne weiter! Ein Sharing über Ihre Social Networks ist viel stärker und effizienter als Sie sich vorstellen können!
Und wenn wir die erforderliche Summe nicht erreichen? Oder sie überschreiten?
Das Budget, um den Film zu vollenden, ist relativ flexibel. Die 225.000 Euro brutto, die wir anstreben, sind der Betrag, mit dem der Film unter Verzicht auf alles verzichtbare, aber ohne Abstriche an der Qualität beendet werden kann. Wenn Ihre Beiträge nicht diese Höhe erreichen sollten, sind wir gezwungen, an allen Bearbeitungen der Postproduktion zu sparen. 
Im wunderbaren Fall, dass wir mehr sammeln, wird der ganze Betrag ausschließlich in den Dokumentarfilm investiert: Wir könnten dann Rechte für Musikstücke erwerben, die sonst zu teuer wären, oder in Stimmen von bedeutenden Schauspielern investieren. Zusätzliche Beiträge helfen uns auch, wenn es um den Vertrieb geht, so dass der Film mehr Aufmerksamkeit erhält!
_________________________________________________________________________

Angesichts des kleinen Teams und des enormen Projekts musste wir alle das Äußerste geben, um die Aufnahmen zum Abschluss zu bringen. Alle Teammitglieder wurden nicht nur wegen ihrer technischen Begabung, sondern auch ihrer Tierliebe gewählt. Und deshalb ist unserer Meinung nach das Wunder geschehen: Die Tiere haben das erfasst, haben uns mit ihrer Spontanität überrascht und beschenkt und so ihren größten Beitrag geleistet. Sie wurden selbst Teil des Teams! 
Victor Tognola ist der Regisseur von Samadhi. Er hat in seiner Karriere über 3000 Werbespots inszeniert und produziert und damit zahlreiche internationale Preise errungen, vor allem den Grand Prix und zwölf Löwen beim Internationalen Werbefilmfestival in Cannes sowie den Grand Award beim International Film & TV Festival New York. 1984 schrieb und inszenierte er den Langfilm “Illusione”, der zu den Internationalen Filmfestspielen in Venedig und zum Internationalen Filmfestival in Karlovy Vary eingeladen wurde. Für Blue Lion Films übernahm er Drehbuch und Regie bei der Zeichentrickserie von Adelchi Galloni “Die schönsten Märchen der Welt“ (52 Episoden aus der Fabelwelt von Äsop) und “Chlorofilla vom blauen Himmel” (10 Episoden aus Science Fiction und Ökologie). In den letzten Jahren drehte er zahlreiche Dokumentarfilme über anthropologische Forschungen zum kollektiven Gedächtnis. 
Anne-Marie Rodeghiero, unsere beliebte Ansprechpartnerin, hat den Beruf der Produzentin bei Frama Films gelernt. Ihre Karriere begann in der Werbeproduktion, was eine ziemlich harte Schule ist. Anschließend war sie an zahlreichen Werken beteiligt, die von Frama Films produziert wurden: Mysteriöse Schweiz (Programm des Schweizer Fernsehens), Erich Maria Remarque, Paulette Goddard, Marlene Dietrich (Moscow International Filmfestival), Schmidhauser (Filmfestival Locarno), um nur einige zu nennen. Am Dokumentarfilm SAMADHI – We Are One arbeitete sie als Ko-Autorin auch kreativ mit. 
Marc Bachmann hat seine berufliche Karriere mit der Ausbildung zum Werbefotografen begonnen.1996 trat er die Er fotografierte auf Reisen in den USA und Zentralamerika und realisierte Reportagen zu den Themen Musik und Gesellschaft in der Schweiz. Seit 2011 ist Marc Bachmann frei arbeitender Kameramann mit Kunden in der Webung und dem freien Dokumentarfilm. Er realisierte Projekte für die SBB, das Spick Magazin, Tierwelt, die Stiftung ZSGE, IWC, upc cablecom, Victor Tognola, Simon Steuri, Myriam Zumbühl und viele mehr. 
Riccardo Nasoni ist der Cutter von Samadhi – We are One. Im Gegensatz zu vielen Filmeditoren beginnt Richard seine Arbeit häufig schon während der Aufnahmen bei der Mitarbeit am Set, so dass er anschließend einen größeren Überblick über den Film hat. Er studierte an der Kunstfakultät DAMS an der Universität Bologna (1987 – 1991), war Vorsitzender des italienischen Cutterverbands AMI – Associazione Montatori Italiani (2009 – 2014) und Editing Tutor  für Mediaset-Italia 1.

Der ältere Sohn von Victor Tognola studierte Filmkunst und -technik an der London Film School und absolvierte anschließend ein kreatives Praktikum bei dem Multimediakünstler Klaus Gorges beim Projekt „Solart“, Big Sur, Kalifornien. Er leitete Werbesports, war als Berater am Aufbau des Satellitenfernsehsenders „La Quatrième“ für Hamzatu Wasl, Casablanca, beteiligt. Er war Autor, Regisseur des Dokumentarfilms „Ivan Bianchi“, einer Koproduktion mit dem TSI und dem Verlag Edizioni Le Ricerche, in künstlerischer Zusammenarbeit mit dem bekannten russischen Fotografen Alexandr Kitajev. Er unterrichtete Regie und Kreativität am SAE Institute in Zürich. An den meisten Produktionen von Frama Films war er künstlerisch beteiligt, auch an SAMADHI. 
Vanja, der Sohn von Victor Tognola und Mishas Bruder, konnte schon ganz jung an den Filmproduktionen seines Vaters teilnehmen. In “Samadhi – We are One” war er Kameraassistent am Set und in der Postproduktion Kreativberater. Außerdem hat er diese Crowdfunding-Kampagne konzipiert. In diesem Jahr beginnt er sein Studium des Films an der renommierten Zürcher Hochschule der Künste. 
Offizieller Sicherheitsminister im Haus, Artù hat für diesen Film die Rolle des Verhaltensforschers übernommen, so dass wir nun viele Dinge über die Tiere verstehen können. Seine Liebe war und ist eine wichtige Quelle der Inspiration für die Realisierung von Samadhi.
 
 Nach dem Kunststudium an der Accademia di Brera widmet er sich der Illustration und dem Animationszeichnen und erhielt eine Reihe bedeutender internationaler Anerkennungen, darunter die goldene Palme beim Internationalen Werbefilmfestival in Cannes. Zusammen mit Victor Tognola entwarf er die Figuren und Bühnenbilder für Die schönsten Märchen der Welt und Chlorofilla vom blauen Himmel. In den 80er Jahren veröffentlichte er als Autor Bücher für Kinder und Jugendliche, war aber auch als Illustrator für Zeitschriften und Newsmagazines tätig (Corriere della Sera, Grazia usw.). In den 90er Jahren lehrte Galloni an der Scuola Internazionale dell'Illustrazione in Venedig und dem Istituto Europeo di Design in Mailand; seit 2008 ist er Dozent an der Accademia di belle arti in Bologna; er war Characters Creator und Szenenbildner für den Film Johan vom Po entdeckt Amerika (von Nobelpreisträger Dario Fo). Seine malerischen Werke zeigte er in zahlreichen Ausstellungen in Galerien und öffentlichen Räumen in Italien und Europa.

 “Mira a tu perro a los ojos y no podrás afirmar que no tiene alma” 
- Victor Hugo
 
La película la hemos financiado nosotros mismos, casi en su totalidad. Durante un cierto período, pudimos contar también con unos co-productores americanos, de los cuales decidimos liberarnos, al darnos cuenta de que no solamente eran incapaces de comprender el amor de los animales, sino que también habrían perjudicado la película, imponiéndonos sus decisiones con el fin de obtener un producto de fácil ganancia. Por esta razón, decidimos financiar la película nosotros solos, para mantener y tutelar un total control creativo.
Describir con palabras Samadhi – We Are One es tarea algo difícil, pero lo intentaremos.
Samadhi es un documental sobre y dedicado a los animales diferente de los que se suelen ver. Viéndolo, no tendréis la sensación de quedar arrollados por un mar de nociones, ni descubriréis la organización del trabajo de las hormigas verdes, ni los rituales de apareamiento de los manatíes.
Samadhi se aparta de los acostumbrados documentales de género informativo, haciendo vivir siete mágicas historias de amistad y cariño entre humanos y animales, rodadas viajando entre Asia y Europa.
Os sorprenderá una experiencia que, a veces, logra ser conmovedora y divertida, mientras que otras veces infunde algo de tristeza.
Descubriréis que entre nosotros y los animales las únicas barreras que existen son las que nosotros mismos hemos inventado.  
Hemos rodado este documental con el objetivo de difundir una mayor concienciación sobre los animales y su causa. 
Al contrario de otros vídeos cuyos objetivos eran los mismos que los nuestros, Samadhi no solamente expone el sufrimiento que sienten estas criaturas, sino que pone en evidencia su extraordinaria capacidad de amar.

Con nuestros ahorros hemos podido llevar a cabo las tomas y realizar un primer montaje. Queda todavía mucho trabajo por hacer, antes de que el documental esté listo para lanzarlo al público, y nuestros fondos no son suficientes. Por eso os pedimos ayuda. Con vuestros aportes podremos terminar la película, para poder mostrar todo su esplendor al mundo entero.  
Gracias a vuestra ayuda conseguiremos lo siguiente:

Llegar al montaje definitivo
Pagar los honorarios de los actores de voz y grabar sus voces
Pagar derechos por la utilización de las músicas usadas en el documental
Preparar las mezclas de audio definitivas
Perfeccionar el etalonaje
Grabar en formato DCP para las proyecciones
Crear un diseño para el póster cinematográfico y para el DVD

 
Si no tenéis la posibilidad de hacer una donación, pero queréis ayudarnos, compartid esta campaña de micromecenazgo o Crowdfunding. Compartir en las redes sociales es mucho más potente y eficaz de lo que se piensa. 
 
¿Y si no se alcanzara la cifra pedida? ¿Y en caso de que se superara tal cifra?
El presupuesto para poder terminar la película es relativamente flexible. Los 225.000 euros contados en bruto que pedimos, suponen lo suficiente para terminar la película, renunciando a todo lo que se pueda renunciar, pero sin que melle su calidad. En caso de que vuestros aportes no llegaran a esta cifra, nos veríamos obligados a tener que ahorrar en todas las labores de post-producción. En el caso maravilloso de que superáramos tal cifra, todo quedaría invertido sólo y exclusivamente en el documental: podríamos, por ejemplo, adquirir derechos por las músicas, que son demasiado caras, o invertir en voces de actores conocidos. Además, los aportes complementarios nos ayudarían también a la hora de distribuir el documental, dándole aún más visibilidad.

Considerando la reducida dimensión del equipo técnico, respecto a la grandeza del proyecto, hemos tenido que sacar lo máximo de nosotros mismos para poder llevar a cabo el rodaje. Cada miembro del Equipo ha sido elegido considerando su amor por los animales, además de sus capacidades técnicas. Estamos convencidos de que ésta es la razón que ha conducido al milagro: los animales lo han entendido y han querido sorprendernos ofreciéndonos su espontaneidad y aportando todo lo que podían. Ellos también han pasado a formar parte del Equipo Técnico.

Oficialmente Ministro de la Seguridad del Hogar, Artù ha desarrollado para esta película el papel de etólogo, permitiéndonos comprender muchas cosas sobre los animales. Su desbordante cariño ha sido una de las principales fuentes de inspiración para la realización de Samadhi.

With the strength of a robot (Robocop not Terminator), heart of a Will Ferrell in Elf, and lack of sleep of a robot (Short Circuit), Molly is our amazing producer.
Molly graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a degree in Radio-Television-Film in 2015 and now works in Austin, Texas. She began as a writer and director before focusing on assistant directing and producing to bring original stories to life. Molly began producing a year ago and has so far produced the short films Marlin Texas, Prelude, Into the Ether, Pop, Crackle, Snap, and the TSTV show bUrnT.


Danny HynesDanny is out assistant producer. He and Sean are long-time collaborators, having worked together since meeting 4 years ago. Hynes is a graduate of UT Austin's Radio-Television-Film program with aspirations of continuing to work within the southeastern film and television industry. Also, in case you were wondering, that is a picture of a Danny's dog, not the man himself. You don't want that in your life.



Aaron Alexander
Aaron is a professional actor and stunt coordinator in Texas. From ""American Crime"" and ""The Leftovers"" to the ""De-Pixelated"" series, Aaron shines both as an actor and a stunt performer. He's dedicated to his craft while making sure to smile the whole way through.  We're thrilled to have him.


Bri Korin
Look at her! Look at that! She's awesome! From acro to stunt fighting, Bri can do it all. She's talented both in front of and behind the camera, having experience casting several major motion pictures and producing several shorts. Bri kicks a lot of ass in this movie and when you see it you're gonna be blown away!
    Can I watch any of your past stuff?
Sure! Take a looksie!Bri Korin

<p>Our hero is a middle-class man.. or to

Άντρας, όπως λέμε, σπάνιας κοπής, απόλαυσε την εποχή της αφθονίας με την

αναγκάζεται πλέον να προσαρμοστεί στη νέα κοινωνική πραγματικότητα της απόλυσης
και της ενασχόλησης με τα οικιακά, την πιο δύσκολη δουλειά, όπως συνήθιζε να
λέει και η μάνα του, ίσως όμως και την πιο ψυχικά εξουθενωτική. Και είναι αυτόν
ακριβώς τον εξουθενωτικό εγκλεισμό, αυτή την περιοριστική άχρωμη κανονικότητα
που προσπαθεί να υπερκεράσει αφυπνίζοντας, έστω και με έναν τρόπο τόσο

<div>Its a documentary series that features the movers and shakers in Hartford, CT!</div>

<div><b>A Little Bit About Me</b></div> <ul>
<li>I'm Josiah Schlee, I'm a 23 year old freelance photo and videographer fresh out of college with a Bachelor of the Arts in Cinema Production. </li>
<li>I originally majored in Electronic Journalism, so combining those two programs (Journalism and Cinema) has made me extremely interested in exploring cultures and subcultures.</li> <li>I am passionate about discovering and investigating the unknown, that sits right under our noses and digging up the stories that everyone else misses.</li>
<li>The purpose of this campaign is to raise enough money for me to buy the proper cinematic equipment to produce a product that is of a high enough quality to reach a potentially global audience. I want to show my audience first off, what Hartford has to offer; and eventually show them what cities around the nation and then the world have to offer that the common travel and culture television show overlooks.</li> <li>If my goal is reached the next episode I produce I will be able to pitch to Netlfix, Hulu, Amazon, Yahoo, Vimeo, etc as a marketable and presentable documentary piece.</li>

</div></div>","What is: Hartford Is Not Dead ?
Its a documentary series that features the movers and shakers in Hartford, CT!
Help me to create and continue a documentary series highlighting the growth going on within Hartford, CT that the mainstream news overlooks. I want to shine a positive light back on our city and bring what Hartford has to offer!

A Little Bit About Me 
I'm Josiah Schlee, I'm a 23 year old freelance photo and videographer fresh out of college with a Bachelor of the Arts in Cinema Production. 
I originally majored in Electronic Journalism, so combining those two programs (Journalism and Cinema) has made me extremely interested in exploring cultures and subcultures. I am passionate about discovering and investigating the unknown, that sits right under our noses and digging up the stories that everyone else misses.
The purpose of this campaign is to raise enough money for me to buy the proper cinematic equipment to produce a product that is of a high enough quality to reach a potentially global audience. I want to show my audience first off, what Hartford has to offer; and eventually show them what cities around the nation and then the world have to offer that the common travel and culture television show overlooks. If my goal is reached the next episode I produce I will be able to pitch to Netlfix, Hulu, Amazon, Yahoo, Vimeo, etc as a marketable and presentable documentary piece.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong>The Campaign</strong></p>
<p>A team of recently graduated student filmmakers are needing YOUR help to share their fully finished award winning film ""Inheritance"" with the world.</p>
<p><strong>Holly Black</strong> - Writer/Director/DP/Editor</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1628384221/mut8riozffumru3whu7k.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>My name is Holly Black and I am one of the co-founders of Wolf and Willow Productions. I graduated with a BFA in film from Evangel University in 2020 and have worked as a writer, producer, and director on multiple feature films: ""Actress for Hire"", ""Enigma"" and ""Led Astray"", to name a few. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Kayla Kononiuk </strong>- Producer/Assistant Director</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1628385610/jum7kwoj5syixremsqs8.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Kayla Kononiuk is Wolf and Willow Productions other founder. Kayla has loved to make fun videos with her friends since she was little and that love sent her on a path to become a filmmaker. At Evangel University, she worked as Camera Operator/Grip on the short film “Out of my Mind” and many other projects. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Synopsis</strong></p>
<p>College drop-out Luke Wheaton is trapped in a fractured family. But when he receives his inheritance he suddenly has the power to make his own path. Lured by a pretty face and the promise of winning big Luke journeys with his friends to find his future. But things are not what they seem. A criminal with a dark secret has just been released and is on a mission: one that will change the Wheaton family forever.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Story Behind the Story</strong></p>
<p>I (Holly) have been making movies since seventh grade and I loved the process so much I went to college for it. 2020 was my senior year and I had written my best film yet, a poignant yet dramatic and comedic family drama titled ""Inheritance"".  Our cast and crew was loaded with talent, it was going to be amazing. </p>
<p>Then Covid hit. </p>
<p>At this point we had already filmed half of the movie.  And so much time and energy and heart had gone into production that it seemed like a tragedy to scrap it now.  We decided to push on filming (with lots of Covid precautions) and we were able to receive the finances to finish the film thanks to our amazing community.</p>
<p>Now the film is finished and we need that community again. </p>
<p>We are giving you a chance to join us on our filmmaking journey as we raise funds to help cover post production and distribution expenses.  Help spread this message of hope with the world! </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Mission</strong></p>
<p>Our goal is to use this film to its full potential and share it with as many people as possible</p>

<p>Inheritance is a film that explores the message of forgiveness and reconciliation.  It is a powerful film that has moved people.  <strong>At the core of this film is a message that is bigger than the film's creators, and we believe it is our mission to bring that message to the world.  </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Changing Perceptions</b></p>
<p>Inheritance also deals with themes of drug addiction, the stereotypes surrounding those who have been incarcerated, and homelessness.  All issues that the world needs to pay attention to.  <strong>By sharing Inheritance with the world we believe that we will help raise awareness about these issues and get people to think differently about those who are struggling with addiction, ex-cons, or experiencing homelessness.  </strong>We want to help humanize them.  They are not the enemy, <strong>they are our brothers and our sisters</strong>, and it's time we welcome them home. </p>
<p>We hope that Inheritance will help start a conversation about how we can better help our brothers and sisters and encourage filmmakers to create movies that matter.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Is it good though?</strong></p>
<p>This film has gotten positive feedback during test screening and won ""Best Student Feature Film"" in the Texas Faith and Family Film Festival, and we are sure you'll like it too.</p>
<p>This is the 6th feature film I (Holly) have worked on.  So I have years of experience crafting compelling stories and creating enjoyable films.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The risks associated with this project are low.  If we aren't able to find funding, we will still be able to release Inheritance, but it won't be in DVD and Blu-ray format and we will not be able to reach nearly as many people.</p>

The Campaign
A team of recently graduated student filmmakers are needing YOUR help to share their fully finished award winning film ""Inheritance"" with the world.
Holly Black - Writer/Director/DP/Editor

My name is Holly Black and I am one of the co-founders of Wolf and Willow Productions. I graduated with a BFA in film from Evangel University in 2020 and have worked as a writer, producer, and director on multiple feature films: ""Actress for Hire"", ""Enigma"" and ""Led Astray"", to name a few. 
 
Kayla Kononiuk - Producer/Assistant Director

Kayla Kononiuk is Wolf and Willow Productions other founder. Kayla has loved to make fun videos with her friends since she was little and that love sent her on a path to become a filmmaker. At Evangel University, she worked as Camera Operator/Grip on the short film “Out of my Mind” and many other projects. 
 
The Synopsis
College drop-out Luke Wheaton is trapped in a fractured family. But when he receives his inheritance he suddenly has the power to make his own path. Lured by a pretty face and the promise of winning big Luke journeys with his friends to find his future. But things are not what they seem. A criminal with a dark secret has just been released and is on a mission: one that will change the Wheaton family forever.
 
The Story Behind the Story
I (Holly) have been making movies since seventh grade and I loved the process so much I went to college for it. 2020 was my senior year and I had written my best film yet, a poignant yet dramatic and comedic family drama titled ""Inheritance"".  Our cast and crew was loaded with talent, it was going to be amazing. 
Then Covid hit. 
At this point we had already filmed half of the movie.  And so much time and energy and heart had gone into production that it seemed like a tragedy to scrap it now.  We decided to push on filming (with lots of Covid precautions) and we were able to receive the finances to finish the film thanks to our amazing community.
Now the film is finished and we need that community again. 
We are giving you a chance to join us on our filmmaking journey as we raise funds to help cover post production and distribution expenses.  Help spread this message of hope with the world! 
 
The Mission
Our goal is to use this film to its full potential and share it with as many people as possible

The Impact
An Important Message
Inheritance is a film that explores the message of forgiveness and reconciliation.  It is a powerful film that has moved people.  At the core of this film is a message that is bigger than the film's creators, and we believe it is our mission to bring that message to the world.  
 
Changing Perceptions
Inheritance also deals with themes of drug addiction, the stereotypes surrounding those who have been incarcerated, and homelessness.  All issues that the world needs to pay attention to.  By sharing Inheritance with the world we believe that we will help raise awareness about these issues and get people to think differently about those who are struggling with addiction, ex-cons, or experiencing homelessness.  We want to help humanize them.  They are not the enemy, they are our brothers and our sisters, and it's time we welcome them home. 
We hope that Inheritance will help start a conversation about how we can better help our brothers and sisters and encourage filmmakers to create movies that matter.
 
Is it good though?
This film has gotten positive feedback during test screening and won ""Best Student Feature Film"" in the Texas Faith and Family Film Festival, and we are sure you'll like it too.
This is the 6th feature film I (Holly) have worked on.  So I have years of experience crafting compelling stories and creating enjoyable films.
 

Risks & Challenges
The risks associated with this project are low.  If we aren't able to find funding, we will still be able to release Inheritance, but it won't be in DVD and Blu-ray format and we will not be able to reach nearly as many people.

If you can't give financially, that is completely okay.  We still need your help!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi I'm Ginger Britt Daniels and I wrote this short female driven cop mystery/drama. I am also producing this film through my GingerPants Productions, and am lead actress in the film. I have been a working actress for over 20 years, and started my production company about 2 years ago. This is my first foray into writing my own script. Here is what it's about: A tortured cop/mother must find the abuser and killer of a young girl with the help of her sister in order to make peace with her troubled past.</p>
<p>I am crowdfunding because we are shooting in the NY/NJ area I cannot imagine making this project without each and every one of the people  involved, so I hope that you can make this dream of mine a reality. It is of the utmost importance that I get this story out to YOU because my story is very close to my heart. The subject deals with child sexual abuse trauma and what that can create in an adult woman. </p>
<p>You will help us achieve the goal of AWARENESS on this subject, and I am donating a percentage of all money that is donated to us to the National Center on Domestic and Sexual Violence. With your help, we can make a difference. I hope to make that difference with my film, but we need help to make it the very best that it can be. </p>

<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need And What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $10,000.00 to make this the best short film that we can. The money is going to the expense of shooting on the east coast with a relatively large cast and crew.  </p>
<p>You as a donator to the cause will be helping as I said earlier, REAL SURVIVORS OF CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE. That alone should make you want to help. AND these funds, if we obtain more than our goal, will go to directly to THE NATIONAL CENTER ON DOMESTIC AND SEXUAL VIOLENCE. </p>
<p>You will also, depending on your pledge, be able to enjoy such perks as having your name in the ending credits, as well as first access to viewing the completed film, AND specialized film merchandise...not to mention access to behind the scenes footage.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Again, you could make the difference, no matter how small, in the life of a young girl or boy who has survived unimaginable trauma at the hands of abuse. You are also allowing us to move forward and put our artistic view on the subject matter that could help encourage countless children to be brave enough to come forward and tell their own story, not to mention help them to know that THEY ARE NOT ALONE.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If by chance you cannot make a financial contribution, THAT'S OK! We'd love it if you got the word out about our film, and encouraged those that CAN contribute to do so. Spread it around to your friends and followers...anyone that you think might be interested in this important film.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Kevin Fredericks. I'm a creator and comedian with dreams of achieving more. I currently make a daily video and travel the United States performing stand up comedy. </p>
<p>This project is important to me for three reasons: It is paramount for me to follow my dreams despite AMAZING obstacles hoping to inspire others to do the same in their lives.  It is important to me to give other people the opportunity to follow their dreams. Finally I want to show my children and others that if you set your mind to something and have FAITH in yourself and what God has for you, YOU CAN DO ANYTHING!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I can do a lot of things on my own including financing this entire comedy tour, however, I cannot film and produce this documentary on my own.  The money raised will be used to pay the director and filmmaker, cover his travel costs, and to hire an editor. </p>
<p>$5,000 will cover the director who </p>
<p>$7,500 will cover his travel and lodging<br/><br/>$2,500 will cover an editor.</p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal, all of the money will cover travel and lodging. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The world NEEDS clean content.  We need to inspire our children to be something more than what today's media tells them they should be. They need to see positive examples on their screens. As much as we hate to admit it, TV and movies help shape us. So, help me create something that helps shape our kids to be better. We can do better than what we currently see on TV and in movies. Please help me show that. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This is a difficult undertaking but I feel in my heart its important. With your help I know it can be done. Based on how much we raise its going to determine how much of the tour he can document. The more we raise the more active he can be. He can come to all the dates. If we don't raise enough there is a chance it is only part of the story. I know we can do it. </p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I first read Stephen King when I was Ten years of age and he captivated me instantly. I watched my first adaptation of his work at Eleven which one might have imagined may have not been the most appropriate age however he inspired me to be who I am today. I picked up the camera soon after this film and started making my own and I haven’t stopped nearly ten years later. I first read ‘Stationary Bike’ unexpectedly at seventeen where I was gifted the just after sunset short story collection by my mother the true inspiration of my Stephen King fandom. I instantly imagined myself making this film very much the way Richard imagined himself along the highway. Visually and vividly. I wrote the first draft when I was Eighteen and continued to work at it over the years until my final year of university where I saw the chance to make this obsession truly realised.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We intend to run this production professionally, and will need the right equipment to make that happen. While this will be a huge benefit to us, the more resources we have at our disposal, the higher the risk of expensive malfunctions or errors. We have had training in all areas of films and have been preparing for any problem that comes our way over the past three years. There is of course no way for us to guarantee that problems will not arise, but we can absolutely promise you that we will be able to overcome any challenges we are faced with, myself and my team are the most determined group of people you will ever meet. We are not like most campaigns if we don't reach our goal, we will have to work as a team to raise the remaining funds however if we make more instead of putting it on the film we will give it to charity of our choice. We want to ensure that nothing goes to waste and that everything runs as smoothly as possible, and that's why your contribution is so important. With you, we will never feel like we are alone on this journey. </p>

<p>What if you could know ""the one?"" Today. And all it would take is a quick peek at your phone and a sample of your DNA. Sounds pretty simple and exciting - maybe a little terrifying that they'd get all your secrets? Well, before you go signing up for this entirely fictional service, be aware that it would also mean that your soul-mate could be anyone, even someone you've broken up with. If you're a match, you're a match. For better or for worse, as they say.</p>
<p>This is a future that is not too far away from our current reality, which we know is already fraught with swiping, pages-long match-making quizzes, and DNA panels pinpointing the hormones that make us compatible with others. Intense. Looks like the need for connection is high? We think so too. That's why we're telling this story. </p>
<p>In our world full of masks and walls, when do we let someone in to know all of us? At what point are we fully honest and vulnerable? In developing this story, the idea of two people who knew each other and had a deep relationship but still had secrets they couldn't share struck a deep chord in us. It's human to want to hide parts of us that could hurt someone we love, could hurt us if spoken aloud, or could bring about a painful rejection. Through Linked, we are exploring the courage and honesty needed to pursue a relationship, even when all the guesswork has been taken out of the equation. </p>
<p>We hope that this story resonates with you and that you'll join us on our journey bringing it to life! Let's all take a look at how we connect with one another, shall we??</p>

<p>1 in every 10 women struggle with endometriosis. That's a lot. So often, it is such a private struggle that even doctors and medical practitioners have a hard time diagnosing it, which is probably why it takes about 7.5 years from the first time a woman begins experiencing symptoms for her to be diagnosed. </p>
<p>We're not making a PSA piece. There are wonderful documentaries that have already been made that share the specifics of this condition (Check out <i>Endo What</i>). Moreover, the experiences with endometriosis are wide and varied, ranging from moderate to severe, so we can't possibly give a complete picture of this disease in a 30-minute short film.</p>
<p>We believe in telling a story about the vulnerability necessary to pursue love, something that is universal. BUT! If we can also represent a population of people who live out their lives with a condition that daily asks them to contend with their own identity and femininity in relationship to others...well, we think that would be best of all.</p>
<p>With your help, <i>Linked</i> will show that we are much more than our physical circumstances and that human connection runs much deeper. (Get it? We're more!)</p>

<p>We're up against a few obstacles in making this a reality.</p>
<p>While our production company is based out of New York City, we are going back to our roots to film in Los Angeles. This is great because of the network we have out there from our days at USC, but also travel makes everything complicated. Everything will need to be planned meticulously, and we will need our team in LA to have everything squared away before beginning in March.   </p>
<p>This is also our first time making a film of this length. A short film can sometimes be anything from 3 to 40 minutes, so we're leaning into the narrative and giving this the space that it needs, which is 30 minutes. With a longer script, multiple locations, and complex shot sequences, this will be a challenging shoot. </p>
<p>Not to mention the subject matter that we want to give the care that it deserves. </p>

Sounds pretty simple and exciting - maybe a little terrifying that they'd get all your secrets?

If you're a match, you're a match. For better or for worse, as they say.
This is a future that is not too far away from our current reality, which we know is already fraught with swiping, pages-long match-making quizzes, and DNA panels pinpointing the hormones that make us compatible with others.

<h2>Story</h2>
<p>We are in an age where there is a decrease in human contact, where artifial intelligence is being built in Asia to care for patients in retirement houses, where we don't stop to take the time to share a moment with a loved one or even less so, a stranger. The film will show the importance of sharing, of human bond, of using that precious time to connect. It is about choosing life even when it's bleak. </p>
<p>Caroline, the carer, will learn this through the cheeky wisdom of old Olivia until the ice is broken between the two. As nothing is all black or white, the story will lead the viewer to understand why Caroline built those walls around herself.</p>

<h3><u>PLOT</u></h3>
<p>After hearing terrible news, Kyle receives an unexpected visit from his estranged older brother, Adam. The two have not seen or spoken to each other in five years. A very hostile conversation erupts as the two try to come to terms from past aggressions. </p>
<h3><u>ABOUT THE FILM</u></h3>
<p>Closure is a dark, gritty film, that deals with two individuals who are both lost souls. They are two brothers who have gone their separate ways, and have isolated themselves in this world. This film throws these two characters (who are polar opposites) together. They are adversaries who bring out the worst in each other. They are bound by family loyalty, but fiercely divided by past events. All they have in this world is each other, but they first must settle their grievances. <br/><br/>It's called Closure because it is the main theme of the film. Will these two brothers find closure with each other? Will they find closure from their past? </p>
<h3><u>BACKGROUND</u></h3>
<p><br/>I wrote this script five years ago, around April 2013. Originally it was a 40-page pilot that included more characters, more locations, and more drama! At the time, I <u>never</u> intended to bring it to life and I certainly <u>never</u> intended for me to be playing a role in it. I simply wrote it for fun. But over time I kept thinking about this story and there was always one scene in that script that I really enjoyed. I realized that perhaps I could take that one scene out of the script and make a short film out of it. So after adapting the scene further and fine-tuning it to fit the short film format, a 40 page script turned into 15 pages. The original version was way too ambitious for a debut director/writer. On my budget, there was no conceivable way to make it happen. So I changed multiple locations to just one and five other characters were cut from the script to accommodate the new structure. <br/><br/>This was a very scary, personal film for me. I've never been so vulnerable on a project (behind the scenes or in front). When you're front and center and handling all aspects of production, all eyes are on you. Every move you take, every decision you make, gets criticized and analyzed - and I was not comfortable with that. But over time, I learned to get over it and made the film how I originally saw it. I never diverted from my original vision.  I went through a lot of emotions developing this film. I had good and bad days. My friends became my therapists, as I would speak to them about my frustrations and fears about the project. I ended up having a lot of support, but I was in a very lonely, vulnerable place. It was not a happy time. <br/><br/>I was absolutely terrified for people to read the script. I've always written things, but I've never allowed people to read my work. It was a horrifying experience. I believed in my work, but I wasn't sure if anyone else would see it the same way. I wasn't sure if anyone was going to understand what I was trying to achieve on paper. But the overall response was really positive, and many parties were really captivated by this project. I was thrilled that this was something people wanted to participate in. There are tiny seeds of truth sprinkled throughout Closure. The majority of the storyline is fiction, but much of the storyline originates from a real experience. I leave it up to the audience to decide which parts are true....<br/><br/>Filming for Closure was shot over two days. Filming commenced on Saturday, June 9, 2018 and ended on Sunday, June 10, 2018. The entire film was shot in Delaware.</p>
<h3><u>WHO'S INVOLVED?</u></h3>
<p><strong>KEVIN AUSTRA</strong> (DE) as Adam (Director/Writer/Executive Producer)<br/>Website: <a href=""http://www.kevinaustra.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.kevinaustra.com</a><br/>IMDb: <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm5688205/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.imdb.com/name/nm5688205/</a><br/><br/>This is my directorial and screenwriting debut in film. Previously, I have only ever acted in films and theater. I have been acting for 13 years. During that time, I performed in 44 theatrical productions and about 21 short/feature films. Many times when I was on set, I would observe what the director and crew did as they prepared their shots. I learned a lot just by watching and taking notes. For Closure, I may have come to table as a rookie director, but I came with a lot of knowledge of how to navigate. I knew exactly what I wanted, I just wasn't sure what I needed. <br/><br/>Five years ago, I asked two friends of mine to read the original pilot script. When they were finished, I asked them who their favorite character was. The two unanimously said ""Adam."" Not only did this surprise me, but it got into my head that Adam could really be a special character. Not just some low-life, over the top, supporting role he was meant to be. <br/><br/>I would have <u>never</u> gotten the opportunity to play Adam, if this film was directed by anyone else. Adam is a strong, arrogant, dominant character. <strong><u>He is everything I am not.</u></strong> But I am a character actor, and I yearn to play roles that are the complete opposite of who I am. However, this industry often casts you on your look and your personality. Therefore, the only way that I would play Adam is if I directed the film myself. Adam was such a tricky, complex character to play. And I knew exactly what Adam was supposed to be. I knew how he was going to walk, talk, and navigate through the scenes. I don't think I could ever properly communicate what I had in mind for Adam to any other actor. So goes the saying <i>""If you want something done right, do it yourself.""</i><br/><br/><strong>ERIC FRANCIS MELARAGNI</strong> (PA) as Kyle<br/>IMDb: <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm8318443/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.imdb.com/name/nm8318443/</a></p>
<p>Since Adam was already casted, I held auditions (by video submission) in April 2018 to cast the role of Kyle. I personally invited seven actors to audition for the role. This was a mistake because they all gave excellent performances! They made my job increasingly difficult. But I only had <u>one role</u> to cast. Ultimately, I chose Eric Melaragni. I was really lucky to have Eric onboard for this film. He didn't have to audition. He could have ignored my postings. No one was forcing him or convincing him to be part of the project. But he took a chance on me. His involvement elevated my project to the next level. The film would not be what it is without him. I needed a strong actor to oppose me on screen. I needed someone to hold his own and challenge my character. Kyle had to be the perfect adversary to Adam. This film relied so heavily on performance and Eric delivered on every aspect. His performance is eloquent, subtle, and he carries the film beautifully. I am truly his biggest supporter. Eric and I previously worked on a web series in 2016, but we only shared one scene together. However, there was no dialogue exchanged between our characters. We never interacted. Until then, our paths never really crossed until this project. This was a wonderful opportunity for us to not only finally collaborate, but it allowed for two different styles and backgrounds of acting to come together and brawl! I warned Eric right before we filmed that when the camera rolled I was really gonna come for him, and he accepted that challenge. <br/><br/><strong>DAVE KRATZ</strong> (PA) (Director of Photography)<br/>Website: <a href=""http://www.davekratzfilms.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.davekratzfilms.com</a><br/>IMDb: <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2274318/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2274318/</a><br/><br/>I always told myself, that if I was going to make this film, I would make it the best way possible. I was not willing to move forward settling with mediocre quality. I would rather pull the plug on this production, rather than cheapen its value. Mr. Kratz delivered on everything that I wanted.<br/><br/>I never met Mr. Kratz before this project. He was the only one involved in this film who I have not previously worked with. I was in need of a DP and he responded to a listing that I sent out. We communicated through emails, phone calls, and text messages. But we didn't actually meet until 2 days prior to filming. These types of projects often turn into a collaborative effort and sometimes that can cause artistic differences between individuals. But Mr. Kratz was a constant professional. He never fought me on any of my ideas. He never tried to override my opinions. He never tried to persuade me or shame me into doing a scene differently <i>(yes, there are plenty of people that actually do this)</i>. He respected every idea that I had and even contributed some ideas to the film that I never thought about! He was respectful, resourceful, and a true pleasure to work with. <br/><br/><strong>ROB BIELLO</strong> (NJ) (Sound mixer)<br/>IMDb: <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm7227596/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.imdb.com/name/nm7227596/</a><br/><br/>I am selfish enough to want the best for my film. When I asked around the local film industry for a good sound mixer, Mr. Biello was always the first person mentioned to me. He came highly acclaimed, so it didn't take much for me to offer him the position. I was so thankful that he agreed to be part of it. I had previously known Rob from an indie film that I participated in, where he also worked as the sound mixer. I was so thankful and honored that someone I knew would be willing to help me out on this project.  I was completely flying blind in the audio department, so there were many questions that I asked Rob, and there was not one question left unanswered. He knows his stuff, he's an awesome guy to work with, and he got the job done. <br/><br/><strong>JACOB HUNTER </strong>(DE) (production assistant)<br/><strong>MAX O'NEILL</strong> (DE) (production assistant)<br/>Jake's IMDb: <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm8050697/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.imdb.com/name/nm8050697/</a><br/>Max's IMDb: <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm9484632/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.imdb.com/name/nm9484632/</a> <br/><br/>I grouped these two together for a simple reason... I NEEDED Jake and Max! No other words can explain it. I have known Mr. Hunter since 2006 and Mr. O'Neill since 2014.  And as my first endeavor into directing film, I NEEDED people who could just assist me in whatever I needed. I wasn't sure what type of complication I was going to face when filming commenced. And I was stressed out about things that haven't even even happened yet. So I needed people who were reliable and who could just help me out with whatever I needed. Jake was the FIRST person (besides me) to arrive to set. His support and assistance truly lifted a heavy burden off my shoulders. Max was able to help out on our second day of filming. His assistance allowed for filming to progress more quickly. With his help, we were able to get a lot more accomplished, and allowed us to wrap up early on Sunday. </p>
</div><div>
<h3><u>WHY WE NEED MONEY:</u></h3>
<p><br/>First, I would like to say this, this film costed over $1,200 to make. That money was funded <strong>100%</strong> by me. There were no other producers or investors involved in this project. I was very happy with how much we were able to achieve on such an ultra-low budget. But I am not a millionaire and currently there are no plans to ever re-coup this money that was invested. Financially, I have reached my monetary limit. So in order to move forward, we are asking for your support to bring Closure to the audience it deserves! <br/><br/>For this campaign, we are asking for $5,000. <i>This campaign is a ""flexible"" goal. What that means is, even if we don't reach $5,000, we will still get the funds that were donated. But we really hope to reach our goal!!!!</i></p>
<p><strong>ADVERTISING:</strong><br/>Simply just posting on social media about the project only goes so far. You are still limited to a certain number of people that will see it. One way we can speed up the process is by boosting our posts. This would reach a much wider audience. You often see these posts on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram all the time as ""Sponsored Posts."" <u>These posts cost money.</u> It could range from $10 - $50 a week, depending on how long you want the post to be seen and your target audience, location, etc. And that is only for <u>ONE</u> social media platform.</p>
<p><strong>SOUND &amp; EDITING:</strong><br/><u>This film is not finished yet</u>. There are plenty of things that I need to fine-tune and polish. That includes color correction and sound. I had hoped to add a musical composition to this film, but all of that requires money for the hardworking artists to create and deliver! <br/><br/><strong>FESTIVALS:</strong><br/>I am dedicated to get Closure into the film festival market! For many festivals, it costs the production PER CATEGORY to submit. Here's an example of a rundown for one festival.<br/><i>Consideration for Best Indie</i> - $55<br/><i>Consideration for Best Cinematography</i> - $55<br/><i>Consideration for Best Screenplay</i> - $55<br/><i>Consideration for Best Supporting Actor</i> - $55<br/><i>Consideration for Best Actor in Indie Film</i> - $55<br/><i>Consideration for Best Duo </i>- $55<br/><i>Consideration for Best First Time Screenwriter </i>- $55<br/><strong>Total: $385</strong><br/><br/><i>Again - these are the prices for just one festival.<strong> </strong></i>The cost will vary depending on which festival you submit, and what category you wish to submit for. But these are the numbers we are looking at. We averaged that just 7 festivals alone will run us up to <strong>$1,500</strong>. <br/><br/><strong>WHERE THE FUNDS WILL GO, IF WE DON'T REACH OUR GOAL?</strong><br/>Everything this campaign receives (whether it be $50 or $400) will go towards Closure's festival run, completing post-production, and online advertising. We will work as hard as we can to bring Closure to a wider audience. But not every festival is appropriate for every film. If the film completes its festival run and there are still funds left over - they will go towards the next film I make. </p>
</div><div>
<h3><u>SPECIAL THANKS</u></h3>
<p>This project could not have gotten made without a few special friends that helped pave the way to make this film happen. <br/><strong>JOHN MORGERA</strong><br/>Mr. Morgera was the first person involved with Closure. He was the <u>first</u> one to read the adapted short film version of the script. He gave me a lot of advice on what I wrote, and indicated areas where it could be stronger. I have never written anything for film before, and he encouraged me to continue onward. He had a lot of involvement in the early stages of production, and I could not have gotten this done without his input.<br/><strong>RAGHAV PERI</strong><br/>Thank God for Raghav! Previously, we have collaborated on two film projects. We work very well together. He became a very valuable consultant when making this film. I reached out to him with several questions during the course of this production, where he gave me tons of advice. If there was ever a time I was suspicious about something or if I had to cross reference anything, he always had an answer for me. He was very encouraging.<br/><strong>DANIEL &amp; BRIANNE MAFFETT</strong><br/>But the biggest thanks of all goes to the Maffett's! There would be no film, if not for Daniel and his lovely wife, Brianne. They offered up their house for the weekend for us to film. I can not thank them enough for their graciousness and generosity. Not only did they offer up their house, but they took extra measures to be out of our way when filming commenced. They were absolutely lovely and I can not thank them enough for what they did for me. </p>
</div><div>
<h3><u>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP</u></h3>
<p>Some people may want to help, but simply are unable to contribute financially. But that doesn't mean you can't help us out! There are so many ways you can help assist us that is completely <u><strong>FREE</strong></u>!<br/><br/><strong>SOCIAL MEDIA</strong><br/><strong>This is probably the BIGGEST way that you can help us!</strong> Please share this link on social media! Facebook, Twitter, MySpace, Instagram, etc. You can use SNAPCHAT and snap a picture of the campaign and send it to all your friends! <br/>Any of these methods will help this film reach a wider audience and it will gain more publicity. We can achieve more funds by more people finding out about us!<br/><br/><strong>WORD-OF-MOUTH</strong><br/>Some believe that word of mouth is the best publicity! Speak to your friends and family. Engage with them about what we are trying to accomplish here. </p>

Jake was the FIRST person (besides me) to arrive to set. His support and assistance truly lifted a heavy burden off my shoulders. Max was able to help out on our second day of filming. His assistance allowed for filming to progress more quickly. With his help, we were able to get a lot more accomplished, and allowed us to wrap up early on Sunday. 

WHY WE NEED MONEY:
First, I would like to say this, this film costed over $1,200 to make. That money was funded 100% by me. There were no other producers or investors involved in this project. I was very happy with how much we were able to achieve on such an ultra-low budget. But I am not a millionaire and currently there are no plans to ever re-coup this money that was invested. Financially, I have reached my monetary limit. So in order to move forward, we are asking for your support to bring Closure to the audience it deserves! For this campaign, we are asking for $5,000. This campaign is a ""flexible"" goal. What that means is, even if we don't reach $5,000, we will still get the funds that were donated. But we really hope to reach our goal!!!!
ADVERTISING:Simply just posting on social media about the project only goes so far. You are still limited to a certain number of people that will see it. One way we can speed up the process is by boosting our posts. This would reach a much wider audience. You often see these posts on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram all the time as ""Sponsored Posts."" These posts cost money. It could range from $10 - $50 a week, depending on how long you want the post to be seen and your target audience, location, etc. And that is only for ONE social media platform.
SOUND & EDITING:This film is not finished yet. There are plenty of things that I need to fine-tune and polish. That includes color correction and sound. I had hoped to add a musical composition to this film, but all of that requires money for the hardworking artists to create and deliver! FESTIVALS:I am dedicated to get Closure into the film festival market! For many festivals, it costs the production PER CATEGORY to submit. Here's an example of a rundown for one festival.Consideration for Best Indie - $55Consideration for Best Cinematography - $55Consideration for Best Screenplay - $55Consideration for Best Supporting Actor - $55Consideration for Best Actor in Indie Film - $55Consideration for Best Duo - $55Consideration for Best First Time Screenwriter - $55Total: $385Again - these are the prices for just one festival. The cost will vary depending on which festival you submit, and what category you wish to submit for. But these are the numbers we are looking at. We averaged that just 7 festivals alone will run us up to $1,500. WHERE THE FUNDS WILL GO, IF WE DON'T REACH OUR GOAL?Everything this campaign receives (whether it be $50 or $400) will go towards Closure's festival run, completing post-production, and online advertising. We will work as hard as we can to bring Closure to a wider audience. But not every festival is appropriate for every film. If the film completes its festival run and there are still funds left over - they will go towards the next film I make. 

SPECIAL THANKS
This project could not have gotten made without a few special friends that helped pave the way to make this film happen. JOHN MORGERAMr. Morgera was the first person involved with Closure. He was the first one to read the adapted short film version of the script. He gave me a lot of advice on what I wrote, and indicated areas where it could be stronger. I have never written anything for film before, and he encouraged me to continue onward. He had a lot of involvement in the early stages of production, and I could not have gotten this done without his input.RAGHAV PERIThank God for Raghav! Previously, we have collaborated on two film projects. We work very well together. He became a very valuable consultant when making this film. I reached out to him with several questions during the course of this production, where he gave me tons of advice. If there was ever a time I was suspicious about something or if I had to cross reference anything, he always had an answer for me. He was very encouraging.DANIEL & BRIANNE MAFFETTBut the biggest thanks of all goes to the Maffett's! There would be no film, if not for Daniel and his lovely wife, Brianne. They offered up their house for the weekend for us to film. I can not thank them enough for their graciousness and generosity. Not only did they offer up their house, but they took extra measures to be out of our way when filming commenced. They were absolutely lovely and I can not thank them enough for what they did for me. 

OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP
Some people may want to help, but simply are unable to contribute financially. But that doesn't mean you can't help us out! There are so many ways you can help assist us that is completely FREE!SOCIAL MEDIAThis is probably the BIGGEST way that you can help us! Please share this link on social media! Facebook, Twitter, MySpace, Instagram, etc. You can use SNAPCHAT and snap a picture of the campaign and send it to all your friends! Any of these methods will help this film reach a wider audience and it will gain more publicity. We can achieve more funds by more people finding out about us!WORD-OF-MOUTHSome believe that word of mouth is the best publicity! Speak to your friends and family. Engage with them about what we are trying to accomplish here.",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<p>Mi nombre es Alexmir Dordelly, soy fundador de la casa productora Mysterious Films, la cual esta encargada de producir mi Opera Prima llamada Examen Final, soy Productor y Director de profesión. </p>
<p>Examen Final es un guión que empece a escribir a finales del año 2011 y con cada año de escritura fue tomando forma y creciendo en su desarrollo dramático, es una historia centrada en un grupo de chicos que tienen experiencias formadas en sus años de estudio de medicina, y al salir a buscar un fin en común, cada uno vive una experiencia diferente llevándolos a experimentar cualquier cantidad de emociones al borde de sus propios limites. Un guión de mucha oscuridad basado en el suspenso y terror.</p>
<p>Con mas de 20 años de carrera en el mundo audiovisual como director y productor podemos nombrar algunos de mis trabajos.</p>
<p>Comerciales: Teragrip, Montserratina, Movilnet, Chevrolet, Coca Cola, entre otros</p>
<p>Largometrajes Nacionales: Una casa pa Maita, Bambi C4, Bloques, Cuidado con lo que sueñas, Circo Fantasia, Libertador, entre otros.</p>
<p>Largometrajes Internaciones: Hands of Stone, Gold, Joy, Versace, Point Break, entre otros.</p>
<p>También he participado en series de tv, documentales, institucionales, videoclips y mas.</p>
<p>Estoy formando esta campaña para poder recaudar fondos para mi proyecto, la verdad es que se me ha hecho bastante difícil contar con inversión privada por la situación económica y política que vive Venezuela. Por lo tanto creo que es bastante factible abrir esta campaña y pedir el apoyo a personas allegadas a mi por amistad o trabajo y a personas en todo el mundo que quieran colaborar en la realización de Examen Final.</p>
<p>Sin embargo hay que ver el lado positivo de lo que se esta viviendo en Venezuela, y es que por la situación cambiaría que vive mi país, es bastante factible realizar proyectos de grandes magnitudes, la moneda extranjera es un punto a favor y juega un papel importante para la realización del proyecto, ya que incluso podemos decir con certeza que con un presupuesto tan pequeño es casi imposible realizar un proyecto cinematográfico, sin embargo en Venezuela apostamos a que SI se puede.</p>
<p>También cuento con Coproducción Nacional e Internacional de gran importancia.</p>
<p>Los equipos de cámara (Red One), optica, luces y grip, accesorios, monitores, camiones, maquina y planta eléctrica ya los tenemos y están a la espera de comenzar el proyecto.</p>
<p>La Postproducción se realizara en la ciudad de New York, bajo el ojo y el profesionalismo de unos chicos super duros en el arte del montaje y efectos especiales.</p>
<p>La música se realizara en Mexico por el gran compositor y productor musical Ruben Sáez, quien se encargara de todo el montaje sonoro, música original y las atmósferas que acompañaran a toda la película.</p>
<p>El casting esta casi conformado, y entre ellos hay actores de gran renombre tanto nacional como internacional.</p>
<p>Examen Final es una película diferente y bastante original, contada desde diferentes perspectivas. Dejando al espectador queriendo mas.</p>
<p>El monto limite que queremos recaudar es de 37.000$, los fondos van completos a la realización del proyecto, sea reúnan o no en su totalidad.</p>
<p>Este monto cubre:</p>
<p>Preproducción</p>
<p>Rodaje</p>
<p>Postproducción</p>
<p>Cubre la totalidad del proyecto, si llegase a recaudarse en un máximo de 2 meses.</p>
<p>Examen Final es un obra escrita por Alexmir Dordelly, director de obras en corto como “Dos almas un Destino” y “Jugarretas”. Ganador de reconocidos premios y de selección en los festivales del genero (suspenso) mas importantes del mundo.</p>
<p>Es un proyecto cinematográfico inspirado en el terror y suspenso, una producción 100% Independiente, que busca lograr entrar en la palestra de las mejores películas de terror tanto en Latinoamérica como en el resto del mundo.</p>
<p>El suspenso, lo psicológico, lo inverosímil y lo fantástico son la atmosfera que arropara al espectador dejándolo querer ver mas y dejándose atrapar por cada historia. Personajes corrientes de la vida cotidiana que buscan mas allá de sus recursos un fin, sin saber que les depara en un futuro.</p>
<p>El tratamiento cinematográfico según el director, no es nada increíble, mas bien, son personajes comunes y el entorno que los rodea es lo que los conlleva a las acciones. Cada historia lleva su personalidad y atmosfera propia y el ritmo de las secuencias son una montaña rusa de emociones que acompañara al espectador en todo momento.</p>
<p>Examen Final cuenta una historia, donde todos los personajes tienen los mismos intereses y todo conlleva a que vivan experiencias inimaginables, aterradoras y malévolas.</p>
<p>Igualmente explora los sentidos del ser humano, deja al descubierto la sensibilidad y la inocencia de las personas, pero también la maldad, el pasado que se esconde y la debilidad por lo prohibido.</p>
<p>Cada historia tiene su matiz, sus personajes y su atmosfera. Cada historia te atrapara hasta querer cegarte y no ver mas.</p>
<p>Una producción de Mysterious Films y Coproducida por Cinexin Estudios y Pata Negra Rentals. Escrita y Dirigida por Alexmir Dordelly.</p>

<p>SINOPSIS</p>

<p> PRODUCCION</p>
<p>El país escogido para el rodaje será Venezuela, ya que paradógicamente por la situación actual que vive, hace que la rentabilidad de Producción sea muy positiva, tanto que suena increíble para muchos productores de la gran industria. El alza del dólar y la falta de producciones cinematográficas hacen de Venezuela un sueño para todo cineasta.</p>
<p>Venezuela cuenta con la plataforma,  calidad y  profesionalismo necesario  para crear una obra con calidad de exportación, que genere trabajo en el gremio de profesionales y sus salarios sean negociables entre trabajador y la producción ejecutiva, siempre siendo rentable para la producción.</p>
<p>Examen Final es un proyecto cinematográfico que cumplirá con los estándares mas exigentes de las diferentes plataformas que existen en el mundo entero, con esto queremos decir, que no solo se podrá ver en la pantalla grande, si no que podrá ser vista a través de canales Premium, plataformas HD, Televisoras por cable y las nuevas tendencias audiovisuales como lo son las plataformas digitales de Netflix y Amazon TV.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Examen Final cuenta con profesionales del cine tanto nacionales como internacionales, por nombrar algunos, tenemos al gran director de Fotografía Venezolano Sergio Castillo mejor conocido como ""Chichi"", al Camaraman José Alirio Rojas que viene directo desde Costa Rica, a la ex Miss y Reina de Belleza Mundial Irene Esser y al reconocido Director de Casting y Actor Internacional Guillermo Londoño.</p>
<p>Los encargados de la Post-producción, montaje y efectos especiales son los reconocidos chicos de Cinexin, con sede en Madrid y New York, la música original será compuesta por el músico y Técnico Sonoro Rubén Sáez radicado en México y como Coproductores tenemos a la gran familia de Patanegra Rentals, quienes han sido parte fundamental de todo el proceso y desarrollo de Examen Final, contando así con equipos de ultima generación como los son cámaras, grip y maquinas.</p>
<p>Una Producción 100% independiente, con un Dream Team comprometido danto el todo por el todo para lograr una obra maestra del genero.</p>
<p>Una inversión rentable con resultados a poco plazo, proyección internacional y posibles ventas dentro de la gran industria, estudios y distribuidores mas importantes del mundo cinematográfico.</p>
<p>Un verdadero homenaje al culto del terror, una película que dará de que hablar y te hará verla una y otra vez.</p>

La música se realizara en Mexico por el gran compositor y productor musical Ruben Sáez, quien se encargara de todo el montaje sonoro, música original y las atmósferas que acompañaran a toda la película.
El casting esta casi conformado, y entre ellos hay actores de gran renombre tanto nacional como internacional.
Examen Final es una película diferente y bastante original, contada desde diferentes perspectivas. Dejando al espectador queriendo mas.
El monto limite que queremos recaudar es de 37.000$, los fondos van completos a la realización del proyecto, sea reúnan o no en su totalidad.
Este monto cubre:
Preproducción
Rodaje
Postproducción
Cubre la totalidad del proyecto, si llegase a recaudarse en un máximo de 2 meses.
Examen Final es un obra escrita por Alexmir Dordelly, director de obras en corto como “Dos almas un Destino” y “Jugarretas”. Ganador de reconocidos premios y de selección en los festivales del genero (suspenso) mas importantes del mundo.
Es un proyecto cinematográfico inspirado en el terror y suspenso, una producción 100% Independiente, que busca lograr entrar en la palestra de las mejores películas de terror tanto en Latinoamérica como en el resto del mundo.
El suspenso, lo psicológico, lo inverosímil y lo fantástico son la atmosfera que arropara al espectador dejándolo querer ver mas y dejándose atrapar por cada historia. Personajes corrientes de la vida cotidiana que buscan mas allá de sus recursos un fin, sin saber que les depara en un futuro.
El tratamiento cinematográfico según el director, no es nada increíble, mas bien, son personajes comunes y el entorno que los rodea es lo que los conlleva a las acciones. Cada historia lleva su personalidad y atmosfera propia y el ritmo de las secuencias son una montaña rusa de emociones que acompañara al espectador en todo momento.
Examen Final cuenta una historia, donde todos los personajes tienen los mismos intereses y todo conlleva a que vivan experiencias inimaginables, aterradoras y malévolas.
Igualmente explora los sentidos del ser humano, deja al descubierto la sensibilidad y la inocencia de las personas, pero también la maldad, el pasado que se esconde y la debilidad por lo prohibido.
Cada historia tiene su matiz, sus personajes y su atmosfera. Cada historia te atrapara hasta querer cegarte y no ver mas.
Una producción de Mysterious Films y Coproducida por Cinexin Estudios y Pata Negra Rentals. Escrita y Dirigida por Alexmir Dordelly.

<h3>About Me and My Film</h3>
<p>Hello, everyone! My name is Vanessa Leonard. I have had a passion for acting and theatre since my grade and high school years. I took theatre courses in college, and I am grateful that it has continued through my adult life. Acting was my beginning; however, writing and directing are my end game.</p>
<p>I began writing my film in February 2017. I knew what I wanted it to be about, but at first, I had trouble finding a story that hasn't been done before. Finally, a premise came to mind. Once I caught wind and saw the project from start to finish in my head, the words began to flow and everything just simply fell into place.</p>
<p><i>A Story Worth Living</i> tells the story of Allison Foster and her childhood best friend, Melissa, who find themselves attending the same college in a small Midwestern town. Wanting to end her junior year strong, overachiever Allison receives a class assignment that goes beyond the classroom and encourages her to perceive life in a more positive light.<br/><br/>Coming from a family that has a past of dealing with mental illness, Allison strives to obtain a more optimistic view with the help of her new boyfriend, Jacob Russell. However, Allison's merry shift of focus may be short lived, as she did not foresee what was about to change everything.<br/><br/>From a Journal to a Journey - <i>A Story Worth Living</i> is a fun, witty, adventurous, romantic drama that will bring tears - both happy and sad - to viewers' eyes, inspiring the audience to bring out the best in others while making the most out of their own lives.</p>

<h3>The Need</h3>
<p>I am raising funds to bring this story to life and here is the breakdown of costs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>$3,000 Talent </strong>- I have an amazing cast and crew that I'm very excited about. However, with great talent also comes costs.</li>
<li>
<strong>$1,000 Travel</strong> - My film requires some travel. We will be traveling to southern Ohio a couple times, Michigan, as well as West Virginia. We will need to take multiple cars, which means multiple expenses (i.e. gas, hotel and turnpike costs).</li>
<li>
<strong>$1,000 Miscellaneous </strong>- Food! Everyone loves food. I prefer to make homemade food rather than purchase a quick pizza. I want to show my hardworking cast &amp; crew that I appreciate them so by feeding them well. But food isn't the only thing that falls in this category. I will also need money for props and some wardrobe, as well as FX makeup.</li>
<li>
<strong>$1,000 Post-production</strong> - I would like to professionally sound-track this film, as well as purchase music rights to a couple songs.</li>
<li>
<strong>$1,000 Film Festival Submission</strong> - My end goal is to submit to as many film festivals as possible. I have already spoken to Sundance, and they have my name along with the name of the film on record.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have asked for over my goal on Indiegogo, due to the fees.</p>
<p>If my goal is not met, I will gratefully accept what has been given and be the best steward with it and adjusts my costs and budget accordingly.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I believe in my project, and I believe in the story. When I gave the script to my casts, many of them were blown away, and I believe you, my contributors, will be, too. I believe this story is important because it breaks the stigma of mental illness.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>When it comes to film making, there is always a risk. Whether it's weather, illness or car troubles, there is always a challenge when making a film. However, I am a determined individual, and I will make sure this film comes to fruition.</p>

<h3><strong>THE HISTORY  </strong></h3>
<p><i>""Ancient Hawaiians believed that water, along with land, belonged only to the gods and therefore could not be owned – not even by the highest ranking ali'i (chief). Water was upheld as an essential source of life and key contributor to the prosperity of the Hawaiian people. The natural resource was so highly revered that the word 'waiwai' was used to indicate abundance or great amounts of wealth... </i></p>
<p><i>Understanding that water directly contributed to a thriving community, people using 'wai' from streams took only what was absolutely necessary. They were expected to share the wai with others. Such practices gave Hawaiians their word for law which is 'kanawai,' or the 'equal sharing of water.' The equal sharing of clean, flowing water provided the foundation from which native Hawaiians were able to maintain flourishing and prosperous communities."" </i></p>
<p>“From the Mountains to the Sea - Early Hawaiian Life,” by Julie S. Williams </p>
<h3><strong>THE FILM </strong></h3>
<p>The description above — about the equal sharing of <i>wai</i> — lies at the root of a conflict that has played out on Maui for over a century. It’s a conflict that harkens back to the arrival of missionaries in the 1820s, the Great Mahele land apportionment that disrupted the sustainable way of life for Hawaiians in the 1840s and 50s, and the illegal annexation of Hawai’i by the United States in 1898. In many ways, it’s a conflict and history that parallels the colonial enterprise that played out all over the globe. </p>
<p>Currently, there is not an equal sharing of <i>wai</i> in Hawai’i. There is not a sharing of wealth. Instead, water politics is marked by theft and corruption and a distortion of the legal system, both local and federal. And Maui is ground zero for this conflict. </p>
<p>In late 2016, Alexander &amp; Baldwin (A&amp;B) ceased production of sugar cane, putting into question the future of over 36,000 acres of land, and the rationale for their water practices — which include diverting millions of gallons per day from East Maui to the central valley, thereby cutting off flow to the many streams and farms along the North Shore. </p>
<p>This is a local story with global implications. Globally, private companies are scrambling to purchase and consolidate their water holdings, knowing that climate change, environmental degradation and rapid population growth will mean huge profits for whomever controls clean water sources. A&amp;B is no different. There system of ditches and diversions on Maui is the largest private water system in the United States, and they know that controlling the <i>wai</i> is their only means of future viability as a public company beholden to creating wealth for their shareholders... </p>
<p>But standing across the protest lines and courtrooms are local community leaders, indigenous groups and concerned citizens who are asserting a different vision — one of cooperative ownership, broad public good, solidarity and health for many over profits for the few. This is a vision that harkens back to the ancient conception of shared health and wealth from a practice of sharing the <i>wai</i>. </p>

<h3>OUR GOAL </h3>
<p>Thanks to several foundation grants, we've already shot approximately 50 hours of footage for the film, beginning in September of 2017. We are now seeking $50,000 to support ongoing production for the coming 6-8 months. All donations are fully tax-decutible, as we have secured fiscal sponsorship through Media Collective, Inc., a registered 501(c)3. Funds will enable us to accomplish the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>Continue to shoot 5-7 days per month, documenting ongoing protests, courtroom proceedings, interviews, as well as water rights hearings at the local, state and federal level; </li>
<li>Edit and distribute three short impact films featuring some of our most compelling characters (e.g. Professor Kalekoa Ka'eo of University of Hawaii; family members who have been fighting for years through legal channels to have their water restored to ancestral lands; the young, passionate lawyers of the Native Hawaiian Legal Corporation; a representative from A&amp;B who can share their perspective on the future, etc.). These videos will serve to build our audience, motivate engagement in the upcoming elections, as well as deepen our ongoing conversations with potential broadcast and distribution partners.  </li>
<li>We will also seek additional grants and foundation support during this time, as this is a story that is happening in real-time, and may not have a conclusive end for several years. We anticipate our full budget -- to deliver the finished feature documentary to broadcasters, as well as distribute 7-10 short impact films along the way -- to total approximately $350,000. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>THE IMPACT </h3>
<p>There is only one Maui. But there are hundreds of similar stories playing out all over the world. We believe this is one that may demonstrate that citizen engagement can triumph over development, corporate greed and unsustainable agricultural practices. </p>
<p>As with our past films, we are confident this film will play widely at film festivals, on television and via streaming, and will serve to engage activist communities around the idea that local change can have a global impact.

</div></div>","THE HISTORY  
""Ancient Hawaiians believed that water, along with land, belonged only to the gods and therefore could not be owned – not even by the highest ranking ali'i (chief). Water was upheld as an essential source of life and key contributor to the prosperity of the Hawaiian people. The natural resource was so highly revered that the word 'waiwai' was used to indicate abundance or great amounts of wealth... 
Understanding that water directly contributed to a thriving community, people using 'wai' from streams took only what was absolutely necessary. They were expected to share the wai with others. Such practices gave Hawaiians their word for law which is 'kanawai,' or the 'equal sharing of water.' The equal sharing of clean, flowing water provided the foundation from which native Hawaiians were able to maintain flourishing and prosperous communities."" 
“From the Mountains to the Sea - Early Hawaiian Life,” by Julie S. Williams 
THE FILM 
The description above — about the equal sharing of wai — lies at the root of a conflict that has played out on Maui for over a century. It’s a conflict that harkens back to the arrival of missionaries in the 1820s, the Great Mahele land apportionment that disrupted the sustainable way of life for Hawaiians in the 1840s and 50s, and the illegal annexation of Hawai’i by the United States in 1898. In many ways, it’s a conflict and history that parallels the colonial enterprise that played out all over the globe. 
Currently, there is not an equal sharing of wai in Hawai’i. There is not a sharing of wealth. Instead, water politics is marked by theft and corruption and a distortion of the legal system, both local and federal. And Maui is ground zero for this conflict. 
In late 2016, Alexander & Baldwin (A&B) ceased production of sugar cane, putting into question the future of over 36,000 acres of land, and the rationale for their water practices — which include diverting millions of gallons per day from East Maui to the central valley, thereby cutting off flow to the many streams and farms along the North Shore. 
This is a local story with global implications. Globally, private companies are scrambling to purchase and consolidate their water holdings, knowing that climate change, environmental degradation and rapid population growth will mean huge profits for whomever controls clean water sources. A&B is no different. There system of ditches and diversions on Maui is the largest private water system in the United States, and they know that controlling the wai is their only means of future viability as a public company beholden to creating wealth for their shareholders... 
But standing across the protest lines and courtrooms are local community leaders, indigenous groups and concerned citizens who are asserting a different vision — one of cooperative ownership, broad public good, solidarity and health for many over profits for the few. This is a vision that harkens back to the ancient conception of shared health and wealth from a practice of sharing the wai. 
KEYS TO THE KINGDOM will be a feature-length documentary that showcases the complexity and drama of this story. At the center will be the individuals on the front lines — those fighting on both sides — as well as the communities that stand to lose or gain from the decisions that must be made. As with Standing Rock, the world will be watching. Once again corporate profit is pitted against the well-being of the everyman and woman, and their children and grandchildren.

The budget for props is reaching new heights. Anyone who has made a short/series/film/etc. knows that post-production is where the vacuum shows up to suck up all your money. Your donations will help us pay for audio clips (which can vary from $2–200), editing, graphics, design, sound mixing, social media posts, VFX and advertisements (buying advertisements on Facebook and YouTube increase your view/profit by a very noticeable amount)... and so much more!We're constantly looking to grow, learn, and expand our knowledge in each project. Tackling horror is entirely new, and scary (hehe) for us. But we know by sprinkling in our knack for comedy, we can hit this one out of the park! Bitchpop needs you!As we mentioned, we have been pitching this concept for years, but unfortunately have not received funding. So now, we're taking control back. We've been saving for months, but need just a bit more to make this amazing concept a reality. No Money? No Problem! Got fingers? Paws? Tails? Feets? Put 'em to use and share this campaign! Because as we all learned in kindergarten, sharing is caring! Here are some posts you can copy+paste or customize on your ownFacebook • I'm ready to support, and see @Bitchpop Productions’s first comedy-horror film House On the Street!

C'est avant tout un film féministe et sensible, cherchant à offrir des représentations cinématographiques différentes, revalorisées et inspirantes.</p><p>Principalement, nous avions envie d’explorer le thème de l’amitié entre jeunes filles qui est, à notre avis, un sujet régulièrement vidé de sa valeur dans ce type de films. Nous cherchions à l’explorer d’une manière davantage semblable à nos expériences. </p><p>Pour y arriver, il a été primordial de situer la narration du film dans la perspective d’un enfant et de faire confiance à son regard. Pour camper les personnages principaux, nous avons choisi Léa, la soeur de la réalisatrice, ainsi que son groupe d’amies réel. De cette manière, nous croyions que la communication et le partage des expériences en seraient facilités.

C'est avant tout un film féministe et sensible, cherchant à offrir des représentations cinématographiques différentes, revalorisées et inspirantes.Principalement, nous avions envie d’explorer le thème de l’amitié entre jeunes filles qui est, à notre avis, un sujet régulièrement vidé de sa valeur dans ce type de films. Nous cherchions à l’explorer d’une manière davantage semblable à nos expériences. Pour y arriver, il a été primordial de situer la narration du film dans la perspective d’un enfant et de faire confiance à son regard. Pour camper les personnages principaux, nous avons choisi Léa, la soeur de la réalisatrice, ainsi que son groupe d’amies réel. De cette manière, nous croyions que la communication et le partage des expériences en seraient facilités. Il était important pour nous d'offrir un espace de paroles et d’agentivité aux jeunes actrices afin que l'histoire soit modifiée selon leur perspective et leurs expériences.   ♜ TRAITEMENT VISUEL ET SONORE ♜CROIX DE BOIS CROIX DE FER est un court-métrage de fiction au traitement visuel et sonore expérimental d’une durée d’environ 7 minutes. Afin de transmettre la vision de la protagoniste, nous voulions que le traitement visuel soit exagérément subjectif.

<p>Zoe is a woman with a strong fighting spirit. Like most survivors of the nuclear apocalypse, she has lost her family in the disaster. Despite her day-to-day resolve, she develops a grim outlook on the future, and each new encounter will test her mettle and her optimism.</p>

<p>This $5,000 budget (per episode), which is easily comparable to an equivalent short film budget, would provide us with the basics, such as:</p> <p>-Rental of the filming equipment, including camera, lights &amp; microphones.</p>
<p>-Rental of the locations, including private properties and film studios.</p>
<p>-Hiring make up artists and make up kits to create the effects needed in a world roamed by Hunters. This includes the fake blood used during action sequences, war paints and injuries.</p>
<p>-Collecting the props such as the fake firearms, the melee weapons, and the body parts.</p>
<p>-Creating detailed costumes for the characters and supporting characters.</p>
<p>-Paying for the time in editing suites.</p>
<p>-Having the basic graphical elements (title screen, supporting visual effects and animations, color correction).</p>
<p>-Getting insurance for cast, crew and equipment.</p> <p>With the stretch goal of $95,000, on top of everything previously mentioned being done better (better gear, better wardrobe, and especially more and better practical effects and make up), we could have:</p> <p>-Better fight choreography through the help of a stunt coordinator.</p>

<p>-More expansive locations and film sets</p>
<p>-MOAR HUNTERS!</p> <p>If we reach our basic goal of 65k, we will be able to produce independently and to keep looking for financing in order to make the series as a whole better: more professional crew members, more efficient filming, etc.</p> <p>If we don't reach our basic goal of 65k, this is not the end of the series: we will continue to apply to other sources of financing in order to make Afterglow your next favorite series to binge.</p>

<p>The message of our film is to cherish and look after the people who looked after you. Even when diseases such as dementia and Alzheimer's can destroy the people closest in all our lives, we have to stand by them and most of all remain strong for them.</p>
<p>Justin worked  in a theatre that offered  classes for those with dementia and Alzheimer's. He had to be trained and taught to understand the effects of these diseases and how the most important thing people can do is help and support them with emotion, as the only thing they will remember 100% are their feelings. They may not know why they feel the way they do but they know it’s how they feel. This was something that we hadn't seen in film or many are aware of, so we wanted to bring light to this matter. Also those who are with or know someone who suffers from either of these diseases are not alone and to encourage them to keep going.</p>

</div></div>","Amelia is an old lady stuck in a loop as her dementia worsens. Unable to recognize the neighbor Tom for who he really is. As Tom visits Amelia everyday hoping to be recognized, eventually reaching his limit. Will Amelia recognize Tom or will they remain stuck in the loop?
 


Amelia: An old lady (60s-70s) suffering from dementia. She is sweet, caring and lonely. Amelia is not able to recognise who the neighbour really is but she knows she has a strong connection to them. Tom: A middle aged man (35-55) with a selfish desperation to be recognized by Amelia. He is caring but strict, strong but fragile and understanding but upset. Trying to remain strong but losing hope.
 


We are a group of second year Middlesex University BA Film students. We have worked together on several projects and launched our own production team - Wolfpack Productions. The inspiration for the name came with our cooperative way of working - our pack belongs together, we support each other. We are a creative and determined team who strive for our goals just  like wolves.

 
Justin Scher-Smith
Our director, Justin Scher-Smith, is an extremely committed and talented filmmaker. His short film Torn Desires had been screened at Festival de Cinema Escola de Alvorada in Brazil in 2018 and had been officially selected by 10th International Inter University Film Festival in Bangladesh.
 

 
Davide Azzalini
Davide, our producer, has an established background in cinematography. He is adventurous and likes to dream big, that’s why he is giving a shot at producing. Davide always thinks positive and is a team player which we deem great qualities for a producer to have. We put our faith in him to provide us with everything we need, and he does the same, as we aspire to excel as a pack.
 

 
Zuzanna Pencak
Zuzanna is our sound designer. With a total dedication and passion for post production, she decided to join the film course and broaden her knowledge about film at Middlesex University in London. Zuzanna has not only mastered different kinds of sound mixing software, such as Avid Pro Tools and Adobe Audition. Recording high quality content with professional gear is also nothing hard for her.
 

 
Tin Man Wu
Tin Man, our art director, learnt art and multimedia design in Hong Kong before studying film at Middlesex University in London. She is creative and passionate about her projects. She is looking forward to use her design knowledge and art skills to create outstanding and engaging visual style for our upcoming film.
 

 
The message of our film is to cherish and look after the people who looked after you. Even when diseases such as dementia and Alzheimer's can destroy the people closest in all our lives, we have to stand by them and most of all remain strong for them.
Justin worked  in a theatre that offered  classes for those with dementia and Alzheimer's. He had to be trained and taught to understand the effects of these diseases and how the most important thing people can do is help and support them with emotion, as the only thing they will remember 100% are their feelings. They may not know why they feel the way they do but they know it’s how they feel. This was something that we hadn't seen in film or many are aware of, so we wanted to bring light to this matter. Also those who are with or know someone who suffers from either of these diseases are not alone and to encourage them to keep going.
 

We aim to raise £1818 for this production. Here’s a breakdown of where your money will go:

Cast - £335
Travel - £44
Lodging - £996
Food - £220

<p>If you had a way to find out how your future panned out, would you want to know?</p>
<p> Hi, my name is Amanda Gordon and I am a Student Filmmaker.</p>
<p>When Opportunity Knocks is my senior film and with it being the last film I’ll be making in college, I want it to be the best it possibly can be! With my amazing cast, my hardworking and passionate crew and your thoughtful donation, that dream can become a reality.</p>
<p>When Opportunity Knocks started off as a short story I found on Tumblr. After reading the story, I feel completely in love with it and knew I wanted to turn it into a short film. After contacting the author, I was given the green light and When Opportunity Knocks was off and running. For the past 7 months, this project has been inching its way towards production. With re-writing aspects of the story, turning the story into a screenplay and figuring the in and outs of this story, I'm happy to announce that production will begin March 20th, 2019!</p>
<p>Garrett McKinney had no way of knowing how, but from a young age he has been able to communicate with his future self. The only catch? His future self never contacts him first. One morning Garrett’s phone goes off and it’s a text from his future self-telling him not to open the door. Just as he finishes reading the text the doorbell goes off and Garrett’s faced with whether or not to open the door. He opens the door to find 6 young girls selling cookies but it just so happens they sell him an opportunity of a lifetime.</p>
<p>Filmmaking has been something I’ve loved doing for over ten years now. On Christmas eve 2008, my grandmother gave me my first camera and from that moment on, my passion for making films has only grown stronger. I brought that camera to school with me and my friends and I would make short videos during recess. It’s crazy to think that those videos, launched a creative drive within me that will never diminish. With your generous donation to my film, you’re letting me know that you believe in me and support me on this crazy journey through the film industry. </p>
<p>So far, my journey has taken me to Western Suffolk Boces to study film in high school, Five Towns College where I’ll be graduating with a Bachelor’s degree in Film and has brought me to 8 film festivals all over New York; allowing me to share the messages that my films have created and get a conversation started on topics that normally aren’t talked about. I’m proud of where I’ve been and what I’ve done, but I’m excited to see where I’m going.</p>
<p>Without you, this film wouldn’t live up to its potential. Your donation would be put towards multiple important aspects of this projects such as wardrobe, props, transportation for our actors and craft services along with so many more important things that go into making a film a success. </p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to look at my project and I look forward to putting your name in my credits soon.</p>

<p><strong>Short Summary of What's at Stake</strong></p>
<p>Public education is one of the most important institutions in our nation and though most know that it's troubled few recognize that it is sitting on a precipice.  The steady flow of large amounts of private funds into public institutions is having a major impact in school districts around the country and brings the pressing question of who controls public schools.  More than 50 % of the nation's public school students are children of color, many from families living below the poverty level and a free quality education is often their only hope for a brighter future. That future is threatened by the shut out of parents, educators, community members and students from the policy and practice decision-making process for their schools. As the influx and influence of private funding steadily grows in local school districts the voice of the people needs  be encouraged and protected . Equity in education is a long-stated goal for the nation but democracy in education has to happen before meaningful change takes hold. Communities around the country who know and are part of the daily lives of children are fighting to increase their voices by using strategies like hunger strikes and teacher walk-outs yet many powerful politicians, corporate interests and education administrators turn a deaf ear and shut them out of the decision making process.  As we lead up to the 2020 Presidential election it's imperative that the voices of Americans in struggling communities be heard and issues important to their futures be apart of the agenda for all candidates seeking their votes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Our Story</strong><br/>In 2010 New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and Newark Mayor Cory Booker joined Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on the Oprah Winfrey Show in Chicago to announce an unprecedented (at the time) $100 million dollar donation to help turnaround Newark’s struggling public schools. The announcement was touted as a proposed model for the future of American schools - the influx of private funds into the public institution. Promises were made which ignited a long smoldering discontent back in Newark, who's residents had seen it all before; lots of money being made by outside groups yet little changed for the children and struggling communities in the state-run district. New Jersey is considered one of the nation's wealthiest states and it's per student spending ranks fifth among all states yet Newark, NJ's largest school district and has an annual budget near $1 billion has seen little progress since 1995 when the state took over the district and it's budget.</p>
<p>The ""Facebook"" announcement gained national attention and was applauded by many but what most peopled didn't see was it's impact;  the parents, students, teachers, school administrators and community members who were fed up with their lives being disrupted by an onslaught of chaotic policies and who fought back against the perceived big money interests and policymakers inserting their will. </p>
<p>Filmmakers Ouida Washington and Derek Koen spent five years on the ground, in schools, and in the communities of Newark, NJ witnessing the rise up of local people as they responded to a school reform agenda that did not include them or even consider their input.</p>
<p><i><strong>No! Not Without Us</strong></i>  is a cautionary tale about five years that changed the course of public schools. This is a story about  the impact of policies and practices that disrupt the lives of children and families across the nation and a grassroots community that empowered itself to fight back. The film seeks to uplift the voices of those on the front lines, bring awareness to what's at stake in the quest to reform public schools  and encourage civic participation in local schools by the people who are most impacted.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>We began filming this project in 2011-12  following 6  students in schools selected in New Jersey's  state approved reform plan as priority schools but as their voices raised in protest to the plan our characters grew to parents, principals, teachers, and community members . We filmed through 2016  and as you may imagine we've captured a lot of footage and it took some time to meet our first challenge of honing down a story from the many we filmed that would adequately share the hard work, commitment and triumph of Newark's public school community.  Our next phase is to get a really solid rough cut of the film and we need your help to be able to bring on the best editor for the job. There are further steps in our process that go beyond the $25K we seek. If we are able to raise additional funds we will continue moving forward with the film toward completion, which includes refining the edit to a fine cut with music, sound mixing, color correction and licensing of outside footage.</p>

<p>Filmmakers Ouida Washington and Derek  Koen were at the helm of the successful film and community engagement campaign Beyond the Bricks, which brought vital awareness to issues facing young black males in school and in their communities. Over a 2 year period The film toured over 75  cities including the UK and helped to spark a conversation and committed actions that led President Obama to the launch the White Initiative's My Brothers Keeper to address persistent opportunity gaps facing boys and young men of color. Beyond the Bricks film and discussion guides are used in universities and organizations across the country. Ouida and Derek have worked to bring attention to educational issues facing marginalized communities since 2008 and will use that track record to spur this important project forward.

<p> </p>
<h3>Story</h3>
<p>Pathei Mathos is an experimental film that will challenge the audience’s five senses. The story, which features intrusive camera work and sound design, is divided between present day and flashbacks. It deals with the way pain is experienced and how trauma dictates the way one moves through life</p>
<p>The flashbacks all happen through the main character’s POV, adding a VR-like dynamic to the story and putting the audience at the forefront of the character’s experiences. For the part of the story set in the present, the quick pace of shots combined with the constant disruption of the 4th wall will challenge the audience to be participants in this experience rather than passive viewers.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Director's Note:</h3>
<p>In Latin America, where I come from, disorders that don’t directly manifest themselves physically are vastly minimized and overlooked. When I began my life as an international student in the United States, a developed country, I realized that the lack of care for mental health disorders in general had no boundaries nor was it restricted to my homeland. Pathei Mathos shows a struggle which is often times invisible to society, as it represents not only the challenges of PTSD but how a survivor’s life becomes even harder when the disorder is unacknowledged.   </p> <p>In its essence, this is a story about pain and loss, about the trauma of unexpected grief and how hurting often makes one feel broken and incomplete.</p>

<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>While Post Traumatic Stress Disorder is often connected to the post-war experience when it gets portrayed on screen, Pathei Mathos aims to show the daily impact that PTSD has on the life of an ordinary girl.  </p> <p>Only in the US, about 10% of females and 4% of males will experience PTSD at some point of their lives, which accounts for 8 million adults in one year (BrainLine.org). Although veterans make for a large portion of that number, every person is vulnerable to PTSD since it is caused by trauma (such as bullying, familial turbulence, accidents, assault of any kind). </p> <p>Pathei Mathos will use the tools of the cinematic art to get the audience close to the main character’s struggles, defying the line that is often used to separate audience and film to incite empathy. The VR-like cinematography as well as the change in frame rate, focus and zoom will be used to represent in an honest and raw way the traumatic flashbacks, often experienced by victims of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.</p>
<p><br/>“Pathei Mathos” is a greek term that freely translates to “from suffering knowledge”, which relates to a point of view that sees pain as a necessary step in the construction of wisdom. Although PTSD survivors have bravely been able to use the lessons they learned from their experience with the disorder to create art and help their community, Pathei Mathos focus on the difficulty of dealing with said condition without support or a full understanding of it.</p>

Story
Pathei Mathos is an experimental film that will challenge the audience’s five senses. The story, which features intrusive camera work and sound design, is divided between present day and flashbacks. It deals with the way pain is experienced and how trauma dictates the way one moves through life
The flashbacks all happen through the main character’s POV, adding a VR-like dynamic to the story and putting the audience at the forefront of the character’s experiences. For the part of the story set in the present, the quick pace of shots combined with the constant disruption of the 4th wall will challenge the audience to be participants in this experience rather than passive viewers.
 
Director's Note:
In Latin America, where I come from, disorders that don’t directly manifest themselves physically are vastly minimized and overlooked. When I began my life as an international student in the United States, a developed country, I realized that the lack of care for mental health disorders in general had no boundaries nor was it restricted to my homeland. Pathei Mathos shows a struggle which is often times invisible to society, as it represents not only the challenges of PTSD but how a survivor’s life becomes even harder when the disorder is unacknowledged.    In its essence, this is a story about pain and loss, about the trauma of unexpected grief and how hurting often makes one feel broken and incomplete.
 

What We Need & What You Get
While we require a good amount of funding to make our exciting project possible, we have plenty of perks and incentives should you decide to help us out by donating! Below is a breakdown of our costs to give you a bit more background on what we need:
 

Camera Equipment………….....$3,000
Lighting…………...………….$4,400
Locations, permits ….................$1,000

Food & Supplies for Cast and Crew…………….….…$150

 
We have donation options of a wide variety of costs, from $5 to $100. Each donor will receive specialized incentives depending on how far up the ladder the donation is. 
 
Thank you in advance for helping our vision become a reality by donating to our campaign! We can't wait to share this special project with you all.
 

The Impact
While Post Traumatic Stress Disorder is often connected to the post-war experience when it gets portrayed on screen, Pathei Mathos aims to show the daily impact that PTSD has on the life of an ordinary girl.   Only in the US, about 10% of females and 4% of males will experience PTSD at some point of their lives, which accounts for 8 million adults in one year (BrainLine.org). Although veterans make for a large portion of that number, every person is vulnerable to PTSD since it is caused by trauma (such as bullying, familial turbulence, accidents, assault of any kind).  Pathei Mathos will use the tools of the cinematic art to get the audience close to the main character’s struggles, defying the line that is often used to separate audience and film to incite empathy. The VR-like cinematography as well as the change in frame rate, focus and zoom will be used to represent in an honest and raw way the traumatic flashbacks, often experienced by victims of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.
“Pathei Mathos” is a greek term that freely translates to “from suffering knowledge”, which relates to a point of view that sees pain as a necessary step in the construction of wisdom. Although PTSD survivors have bravely been able to use the lessons they learned from their experience with the disorder to create art and help their community, Pathei Mathos focus on the difficulty of dealing with said condition without support or a full understanding of it.

Ever since deciding to unite her passion for acting with her love for film, Vitória has tailored her academic curriculum with the sole goal of becoming a better storyteller (both as a filmmaker and a performer). Vitória’s work as an actor-director includes short films made in Brazil, Australia and the United States. Some of her influences include Agnès Varda, Greta Gerwig, Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Anna Muylaert, Christopher Nolan and Kleber Mendonça Filho.

<h3>Summary: </h3>
<p>As the AIDS epidemic began; strangers become friends and learn that everyone has a story.</p>
<p>It began a whispered pledge and became a cry for action.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1570896037/hdcajeuqtuoqhwqwrzpj.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/></p>
<p>In 1985, the writer's best friend asked for a simple request: ""Write my eulogy.""</p>
<p>A difficult and heart-wrenching task, but a task done with love and respect. It took a sleepless night, countless wadded up pieces of paper and agonizing memories, but the eulogy came to life.</p>
<p>After reading the speech, his friend said it needed to be expanded. ""It needs more. More people, more stories, more love. Everyone has a story, and those stories need to be heard.""</p>
<p>The writer began a journey interviewing people touched by the disease. He spoke to patients in the AIDS ward at the hospital where he volunteered. He interviewed nurses, doctors, friends, family, hookers to pastors...anyone willing to share their story.</p>
<div> </div>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1570898423/wyozyxcjgokqmwx0tlvm.png"" src=""""/></p></div>
<p> </p>
<p>He took those personal revelations, confessions and heartache, and formed them into the stage play ""Fallen Guardian Angels"". Through six characters and no-holds-barred monologues, the audience enjoys a roller-coaster of emotional responses as the disease came to life in the stories of their friends and neighbors. </p>
<p>The stage play evolved into the film Rainbow Clouds.</p>
<p>In 2019, HIV and AIDS are no longer considered a threat. The Millennial Generation knows little about the disease. Emphasis is on treatment for those infected, rather than prevention or a cure.</p>
<p>In Rainbow Clouds, the monologues expand to visually show the stories of these six families allowing audiences to experience their full stories, to see the pain and triumphs, to immerse themselves in the history of an unknown disease and the strain it placed on different members of society. History is notorious for swallowing up the ordinary people, and Rainbow Clouds revives their voices, reminding us that life is not always peaceful and accepting. The true heart of partiality remains, but compassion and acceptance shine through.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1570897588/shcffe8rfjqym5yiyadb.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Rainbow Clouds is not about the government's inaction or researchers unable to decipher a riddle; Rainbow Clouds is about the people affected. How AIDS changed their lives. </p>
<p>To maintain authenticity, Rainbow Clouds will be filmed entirely in Central New Mexico, mainly Albuquerque and Rio Rancho areas. </p>
<p>Using the blueprint of a world-wide produced theatrical piece, Rainbow Clouds will entertain, educate and spark needed conversations. Above all, sharing the message that we must always seek hope.</p>
<p>To quote: Rainbows show what beauty can be when everything works together. The colors line up and, boom, a multicolored hug from the heavens.</p>
<p>We hope to create a loving rainbow.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Reasons to Donate or Invest! </h3>
<p>The Number One reason:  Movies are just really cool!</p>
<p>Other Reasons Include: </p>
<p>Investing in local independent films can be beneficial in at least three ways. </p>
<p>You can:</p>
<p>Be part of the increasingly exciting independent film scene, which has produced some incredibly talented homegrown filmmakers who have had their movies shown in theaters worldwide and sold their films to major TV and FILM distribution companies. Films such as The Academy-award winning “Moonlight” demonstrate that not all successful films must come from a large studio with name-talent, but that the heart of the cast and crew must remain true to the story. A strong story and empathetic cast and crew are found at the spark of all successful endeavors.</p>
<p>Support the local film economy and keep local talent local - changing the current cycle of losing the most talented filmmakers to other opportunities on either coast. New Mexico has talent both in front of and behind the camera. The talents are often relegated to Background players or P.A. roles by major studios. The beautiful and lush New Mexico landscape can be used for more than filming Ghost Town Westerns or another Alien Invasion epic.<br/>What better way to prove our worth than to create a memorable film? </p>
<p>25-30% state tax credit for filming in New Mexico. With the recent removal of the Caps by New Mexico government, the chance to reduce (not eliminate) some of the risk of your investment stands clear. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>With the success of Fallen Guardian Angels as a world-wide stage production, the film, Rainbow Clouds, does have a built-in following and audience for attendance in almost all first-run cities in the U.S.A. and abroad. </p>
<p>Rainbow Clouds, will help organizations and companies help raise funding for their non-profit HIV/AIDS organization. Due to the number of requests for a DVD of the stage production, we can estimate a high number of DVD purchases of the film once available.</p>
<p>Rainbow Clouds does not offer a possibility for sequels. There is a possibility to expand the screenplay into a 10-segment miniseries, but that is a future endeavor. However, the possibility of a major company requesting film distribution is likely.</p>
<p>Rainbow Clouds will be entered in various LGBT and noted Film Fests including, but not limited to: Los Angeles, San Francisco, Las Vegas, New York and New Mexico.

<p><strong>Our target Demographic: Employed Gay males, 18-24 yrs old. </strong></p>
<p>Although there is some disagreement about income of gay consumers compared to the average American, most sources indicate LGBT consumers have more disposable income. According to a survey done by Prudential in 2017, gay consumers reported annual household incomes around $74,500, significantly higher than the national median of just over $50,000. Gays were more likely to have higher educations, to carry less debt, to have more savings and were less likely to be jobless with an unemployment rate of almost a point below the national percentage. Additionally, LGBT homeowners in the survey had significantly more equity in their homes and were better financially set for retirement.</p>

<li>26% of gay men say they will pay more for top quality brands</li>

<p>Estimates put the buying power of the LGBT community at over $800 billion annually.

Summary: 
As the AIDS epidemic began; strangers become friends and learn that everyone has a story.
It began a whispered pledge and became a cry for action.

In 1985, the writer's best friend asked for a simple request: ""Write my eulogy.""
A difficult and heart-wrenching task, but a task done with love and respect. It took a sleepless night, countless wadded up pieces of paper and agonizing memories, but the eulogy came to life.
After reading the speech, his friend said it needed to be expanded. ""It needs more. More people, more stories, more love. Everyone has a story, and those stories need to be heard.""
The writer began a journey interviewing people touched by the disease. He spoke to patients in the AIDS ward at the hospital where he volunteered. He interviewed nurses, doctors, friends, family, hookers to pastors...anyone willing to share their story.
 

 
He took those personal revelations, confessions and heartache, and formed them into the stage play ""Fallen Guardian Angels"". Through six characters and no-holds-barred monologues, the audience enjoys a roller-coaster of emotional responses as the disease came to life in the stories of their friends and neighbors. 
The stage play evolved into the film Rainbow Clouds.
In 2019, HIV and AIDS are no longer considered a threat. The Millennial Generation knows little about the disease. Emphasis is on treatment for those infected, rather than prevention or a cure.
In Rainbow Clouds, the monologues expand to visually show the stories of these six families allowing audiences to experience their full stories, to see the pain and triumphs, to immerse themselves in the history of an unknown disease and the strain it placed on different members of society. History is notorious for swallowing up the ordinary people, and Rainbow Clouds revives their voices, reminding us that life is not always peaceful and accepting. The true heart of partiality remains, but compassion and acceptance shine through.

Rainbow Clouds is not about the government's inaction or researchers unable to decipher a riddle; Rainbow Clouds is about the people affected. How AIDS changed their lives. 
To maintain authenticity, Rainbow Clouds will be filmed entirely in Central New Mexico, mainly Albuquerque and Rio Rancho areas. 
Using the blueprint of a world-wide produced theatrical piece, Rainbow Clouds will entertain, educate and spark needed conversations. Above all, sharing the message that we must always seek hope.
To quote: Rainbows show what beauty can be when everything works together. The colors line up and, boom, a multicolored hug from the heavens.
We hope to create a loving rainbow.

Reasons to Donate or Invest! 
The Number One reason:  Movies are just really cool!
Other Reasons Include: 
Investing in local independent films can be beneficial in at least three ways. 
You can:
Be part of the increasingly exciting independent film scene, which has produced some incredibly talented homegrown filmmakers who have had their movies shown in theaters worldwide and sold their films to major TV and FILM distribution companies. Films such as The Academy-award winning “Moonlight” demonstrate that not all successful films must come from a large studio with name-talent, but that the heart of the cast and crew must remain true to the story. A strong story and empathetic cast and crew are found at the spark of all successful endeavors.
Support the local film economy and keep local talent local - changing the current cycle of losing the most talented filmmakers to other opportunities on either coast. New Mexico has talent both in front of and behind the camera. The talents are often relegated to Background players or P.A. roles by major studios. The beautiful and lush New Mexico landscape can be used for more than filming Ghost Town Westerns or another Alien Invasion epic.What better way to prove our worth than to create a memorable film? 
25-30% state tax credit for filming in New Mexico. With the recent removal of the Caps by New Mexico government, the chance to reduce (not eliminate) some of the risk of your investment stands clear. 

The Impact
With the success of Fallen Guardian Angels as a world-wide stage production, the film, Rainbow Clouds, does have a built-in following and audience for attendance in almost all first-run cities in the U.S.A. and abroad. 
Rainbow Clouds, will help organizations and companies help raise funding for their non-profit HIV/AIDS organization. Due to the number of requests for a DVD of the stage production, we can estimate a high number of DVD purchases of the film once available.
Rainbow Clouds does not offer a possibility for sequels. There is a possibility to expand the screenplay into a 10-segment miniseries, but that is a future endeavor. However, the possibility of a major company requesting film distribution is likely.
Rainbow Clouds will be entered in various LGBT and noted Film Fests including, but not limited to: Los Angeles, San Francisco, Las Vegas, New York and New Mexico. We will also enter for consideration for inclusion with Cannes, Telluride, Toronto and various other internationally known film festivals to help increase the possibility for international distribution through a major company. 
With the recent releases of Bohemian Rhapsody. The Normal Heart and other HIV/AIDS films, interest for LGBT and HIV/AIDS material has increased on a phenomenal level.

<p><i>Lust for revenge and regret intertwine in a female-led thriller where the hunter, cab driver Alex Baumann, becomes the prey of his passenger, influential businessman's fiancée and Dr. Sara Karim.</i></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>You don't seem to want to speak German.</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>ALEX</strong></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Well, obviously not but...</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Alex looks at Sara in the rear view mirror, embarrassed.</strong></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>It's fine, we can speak German if you like.</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>SARA</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Oh no, I don't want you to do it for me. We'll speak English. After all, your car, your rules.</strong></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>Do human beings have a right to decide whether a person should live or die?</p>
<p>Sara Karim has spent three years looking for the assassin who murdered her fiancé. Finally, she has discovered his identity, a former hitman called Alex Baumann who now works as a cab driver. Now all she cares about is to kill him and get justice for her loved one and for herself. However she hasn’t considered that Alex has been there before, he has already walked down that same dark path she is about to go down in and he is there to make her reflect upon whether revenge is actually fair and legitimate and whether it is actually able to give that feeling of justice and accomplishment that forces people to commit a murder.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Visual Style</h3>
<p><i>Cabbie</i> is a crime film and, more specifically, a thriller. Set in one main location, Alex’ car, tension is conveyed through gripping dialogue where power constantly shifts between Alex and Sara and the roles of hunter and prey overlap. As information is revealed gradually throughout the story, the audience will experience curiosity of getting to know the characters as they try to hide their true identity to one another at the beginning and suspense about what the characters are going to do now that their intentions are clear.</p>
<p>The narrative device of suspense plays a huge role in keeping the spectator hooked to the screen and, visually, this goal is achieved by a painfully slow-paced kind of storytelling which keeps the audience guessing and by depicting the scenes with low-key suffused lighting that seduces, enchants and beguiles the spectator. </p>

</div><div><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3></div><div>
<p>The big challenge for this production is that it is a highly ambitious project, not only for the camera department but also for the actors, who will need to carry out plenty of research about the characters’ backstories in order to portray them as real people, with their own struggles, fears, ambitions and pasts.</p>
<p>The theme the film revolves around is a sensitive topic that all humans can relate to. In fact, the question about whether we have a right to decide whether a person deserves to live or not is a concern that appeals to every human being, especially as the debate about whether death penalty is legitimate or not is still lively in several countries all around the world.</p>
<p> After all our research and work we are confident we can talk about the theme of revenge in a compelling, fresh and thought-provoking way, but we don't want to underestimate the challenge and will always keep it in mind.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why should you support <i>Cabbie</i>?</h3>
<p>In a time where death penalty is considered as justice in some countries and as revenge in some others, <i>Cabbie</i> throws the question open whether people have a right to decide whether other human beings must live or die. Even though the answer to this question might seem quite straightforward, what would YOU do if your loved ones were murdered? Wouldn’t you give anything to track the culprit down and kill them? Wouldn’t you think that’s the only way to restore justice, both for you and for your loved ones?</p>
<p>By having Sara as its lead, <i>Cabbie</i> also casts an interesting light on the film, revisiting and reframing a genre, thriller, which usually features male leads, in an innovative way. In a time when women’s empowerment is such a sensitive topic, <i>Cabbie </i>tells a story of revenge and, ultimately, redemption conveying the point of view of a woman who lost her man, her husband-to-be, who watched the walls of her life crumble, and who now has the opportunity to take revenge against the person who destroyed her future. But, will she do it?</p>
<p>By supporting <i>Cabbie</i>, YOU will contribute to making an elegant Neo-Noir story come to life, while also making a difference in today's fight for women's empowerment.</p>

</div></div>","Lust for revenge and regret intertwine in a female-led thriller where the hunter, cab driver Alex Baumann, becomes the prey of his passenger, influential businessman's fiancée and Dr. Sara Karim.
SARA
You don't seem to want to speak German.
ALEX
It's not that, I'm just so used to English now.
SARA
So much so that you forgot your own language?
ALEX
Well, obviously not but...
Alex looks at Sara in the rear view mirror, embarrassed.
ALEX (in German)
It's fine, we can speak German if you like.
SARA
Oh no, I don't want you to do it for me. We'll speak English. After all, your car, your rules.
 
The Story
Do human beings have a right to decide whether a person should live or die?
Sara Karim has spent three years looking for the assassin who murdered her fiancé. Finally, she has discovered his identity, a former hitman called Alex Baumann who now works as a cab driver. Now all she cares about is to kill him and get justice for her loved one and for herself. However she hasn’t considered that Alex has been there before, he has already walked down that same dark path she is about to go down in and he is there to make her reflect upon whether revenge is actually fair and legitimate and whether it is actually able to give that feeling of justice and accomplishment that forces people to commit a murder.
 
Visual Style
Cabbie is a crime film and, more specifically, a thriller. Set in one main location, Alex’ car, tension is conveyed through gripping dialogue where power constantly shifts between Alex and Sara and the roles of hunter and prey overlap. As information is revealed gradually throughout the story, the audience will experience curiosity of getting to know the characters as they try to hide their true identity to one another at the beginning and suspense about what the characters are going to do now that their intentions are clear.
The narrative device of suspense plays a huge role in keeping the spectator hooked to the screen and, visually, this goal is achieved by a painfully slow-paced kind of storytelling which keeps the audience guessing and by depicting the scenes with low-key suffused lighting that seduces, enchants and beguiles the spectator.

<p>Hi! My name is Heather Alison.<strong> I am 22 years old and I am a two-time cancer survivor.</strong> I am asking for your support for my senior thesis at NYU, <strong>""Great White Lies.""</strong></p>
<p>I first want to say thank you so much for taking interest in my film. I have been writing since I was six years old and it is incredible to finally be creating something that is so close to my heart with such an amazing team. I sincerely appreciate any contribution that is given to me for this project. You will be part of sending an important message that will hopefully make an impact on the cancer community and beyond.</p>
<h3>My Background</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1580750353/bpjqdozckyj51hfdk5g9.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>In the summer of 2016, just after my 19th birthday, I found myself in a hospital room hearing the words, ""You have leukemia."" My life was put on hold for the next six months while I endured four rounds of chemotherapy. Exactly one year later, I relapsed, and had to spend over a year recovering from more chemotherapy and a stem cell transplant. <strong>In the photo above, I am receiving the stem cells that saved my life a little less than two years ago.</strong></p>
<p>The first time I went through treatment, I immediately tried to return to my life in college like nothing had changed. I tried desperately to put everything behind me and go back to my old habits: partying, tailgating, drinking, and staying out late. I had to accept the fact that things would never be the same, and this led to an incredibly difficult journey discovering my ""new normal.""</p>
<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>""Great White Lies"" is a short film about a 17 year old girl, Sofia, going to a party for the first time since she was diagnosed with cancer one year ago. Every summer, she and her best friend, Beck, throw an epic shared birthday party. Sofia gets clearance from her doctors to be able to attend this year's party, which Beck is throwing on her own. Throughout the short, she deals with many issues that are common among young adult cancer patients/survivors: body image, social anxiety, isolation, awkward questions, and broken relationships.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1580750395/vquq3dnnkmonpfhqgphn.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p>She struggles with the inevitable thoughts that everything would be so much easier if she'd never gotten sick. However, as she goes through the events of the film, Sofia realizes that partying with her peers is not as important as she may have once thought, and the most important thing is that she has made it to where she is today. <strong>She'll keep moving forward- like a shark.</strong></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>When I relapsed, I was added to a Facebook support group made by a few young adult patients. This group became my family. Suddenly, I saw other young adults across the country posting the exact same thoughts, questions, and jokes that were running through my head. <strong>I realized that I was not alone.</strong> In April, I flew to Colorado and I met some of these amazing people in real life.</p>

<p>I've heard hundreds of stories from young adult cancer patients as I've gotten more involved in the community. There are so many unique difficulties that young adult cancer patients face that are not being addressed in the mainstream media. Young adults are already in a gray area between pediatrics and adults in terms of treatment and research. <strong>We might make up a smaller demographic, but we need just as much support as these age groups.</strong></p>

<p>That is why I'm looking to raise awareness about the <strong>Cancer Center for Kids (CCFK) at NYU Winthrop Hospital.</strong> Their psychosocial staff facilitates programs and events for Adolescent and Young Adult (AYA) patients. These provide opportunities for socialization and a sense of normalcy during and after treatment.</p>
<p>The CCFK was my second home during treatment. The doctors and nurses there treated me with exceptional care, love, and support. I am so excited to be able to connect such a personal project with the place that saved my life.</p>
<p>In addition, any money that isn't used for the film will be donated to the Cancer Center for Kids.</p>
<p><strong>I want this film to be a voice for all of the young adult cancer patients/survivors that I've come to know and love. No cancer patient should feel like they are alone.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Equipment:</strong> NYU allots 500 dollars for equipment, but we are going to need a lot more than that. We want to use the right equipment that best tells this story. This also means that we will need insurance, which costs extra as well.</li>
<li>
<strong>Production Design &amp; Set Dressing: </strong>This film has a specific theme and style that has to be represented in other ways beyond just words. This includes art and set dressings, which are important for the overall look of the film.</li>
<li>
<strong>Special Effects Makeup and Hair: </strong>My actress never had cancer, so we are going to need to create scars and bald caps. These are considered special effects and requires hiring somebody with training. I am also using video effects which requires hiring somebody who is trained.</li>
<li>
<strong>Transportation/Food/Lodging: </strong>This film will be shot over the course of three days and we will be transporting a lot of people and equipment out to Long Island. We also need to make sure everybody is fed- The last thing you want is a hungry crew!!</li>
<li>
<strong>Film Festival/Screening Fees: </strong>We want as many people to see this film as possible so that we can spread this important message.</li>

The CCFK was my second home during treatment. The doctors and nurses there treated me with exceptional care, love, and support. I am so excited to be able to connect such a personal project with the place that saved my life.
In addition, any money that isn't used for the film will be donated to the Cancer Center for Kids.
I want this film to be a voice for all of the young adult cancer patients/survivors that I've come to know and love. No cancer patient should feel like they are alone.
What Your Money Goes Towards



Equipment: NYU allots 500 dollars for equipment, but we are going to need a lot more than that. We want to use the right equipment that best tells this story. This also means that we will need insurance, which costs extra as well.

Production Design & Set Dressing: This film has a specific theme and style that has to be represented in other ways beyond just words. This includes art and set dressings, which are important for the overall look of the film.

Special Effects Makeup and Hair: My actress never had cancer, so we are going to need to create scars and bald caps. These are considered special effects and requires hiring somebody with training. I am also using video effects which requires hiring somebody who is trained.

Transportation/Food/Lodging: This film will be shot over the course of three days and we will be transporting a lot of people and equipment out to Long Island. We also need to make sure everybody is fed- The last thing you want is a hungry crew!!

Film Festival/Screening Fees: We want as many people to see this film as possible so that we can spread this important message.

We all know someone who's had their life turned upside down by cancer.

<p>It
is widely publicised how important it is for you to cut back on your sugar
intake. However, with the very naughty and not so nice sugar lurking in almost
all foods, this is a task that is much easier said than done.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, some
people are met with serious health risks and don’t have a choice on the matter.
Reducing their sugar consumption, for them, is the only way to live a happy,
healthy, normal life. This is exactly what happened to Modern Nature’s founder,
Vanessa and is the reason why we are here today.</p>
<p><span>The idea for Modern
Nature liquid stevia all started when Vanessa, discovered she had a rare blood
condition. The potential implications that could arise from her blood condition
were startling and she quickly learnt the best way to control it was by
massively reducing the sugar intake in her diet. </span></p>
<p>This proved very
difficult, however, Vanessa did find that the easiest way to tackle the issue at hand was by
substituting sugar for stevia. While this was good in theory, the problem was
that she needed to consume stevia in the purest way possible. Unfortunately,
all the other stevia products on the market didn’t quite fit the bill. Keen to
solve this problem, Vanessa set out to make her own formulation and Modern
Nature’s liquid stevia was born. Always an advocate to share the sweetness and
provide a solution to help others, she decided to bottle her product and bring
it to the market.</p>

normal jobs, or pretend to at face value. They have no moral code; in general they
like what they have been trained to do. The thought of killing anyone is not an
issue they even ponder. 
  Along the way, a
few try to change their fate without success.
  Their Russian
adversaries are ruthless and care nothing for human life. They care only about
maximizing profits from their lucrative drug trade.
  The head of the
Russian mob, Yury, has no qualms about using excessive force to persuade those
in his path to comply. Unfortunately the BOAS adopt his satanically driven
methods.
 The result is not a
fight between good and evil but rather a battle between evil and evil.
 The movie is old style B&W and is 90 minutes in length.
  We are asking for
donations on Indegodo to help us edit this project, a labor of love for the 50
actors involved
The production was filmed entirely in Fairfield and New
Haven counties in the state of Connecticut.
  Our plan is to
enter the film in festivals to gain recognition for a talented group of actors
et.al.  And gain industry awareness ,so
we’ll be able to shoot another new, conceptually different movie in the future..",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

refuge after it tore away their native village when the water levels rose.

<h3>The Movie</h3>
<p>The 99 Problems movie is my debut as a writer, producer and director. I've always wanted to transition from music videos to shooting for the big screen. Many of my friends are either accomplished actors, or aspiring actors but one thing they all had in common was not finding enough work. I also felt like there was not enough opportunities for my friends so I set out to create a series of projects with this being the first of many.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">99 Problems is a goofy urban comedy created for us, by us. Your contribution will not only be helping create an instant urban classic, it will be ushering in a new era in comedy. We live in what I call the ""social media"" days &amp; times. A recent online phenomenon has made regular folks with just a smart phone and an idea become something called an ""instagram comedian"" or ""vine celebrity"" or ""social media star"". When I started this script I purposely created characters based on a cast of social media stars, mixed with solid experienced actors.</span></p>

</div></div>","This story follows a day in the life of two young
roommates Mar and Shane. Mar brings home Jessica, his usual chick. But,
while Mar and Jessica are in the bedroom her jealous husband
shows up at the apartment. Immediately things escalate into a deadly situation.
Mar and Shane are now forced to figure out how to dispose of a dead body. The roommates decide to enlist the help of a local drug dealer and an ex-con, that's when things get even crazier. And just when they think things can’t get any worse,
a snooping detective shows up at the apartment and discovers the crime scene.99 Problems is a feature length comedy produced by Mazi O. & Phil ""Success"" Hardy. We begin shooting November 7th 2015.

The Director
My name is Mazi Oyo, I am an accomplished video director with
over 400 music videos and interviews in my repertoire with over 60 million
combined views. My video production work has been featured on every major
Hip-Hop website including MTV, XXL, RapRadar, Vibe, and Worldstarhiphop.
Throughout my career I have been blessed to have worked with notable artists such as Jadakiss, Meek Mill, Raekwon, Black
Rob, French Montana, Lil Kim, Maino, and
Troy Ave., just to name a few. 
This year I directed my first feature length film, an independent
romantic comedy called “Dear Playtime”. More recently I was cinematographer for the short film “Going Home”. 
My body of work has allowed me to be featured and interviewed by several major media outlets including MTV, The Source, Sway In The Morning and New Yorks Hot 97FM. 


The Executive Producer

Hardy is a consultant and entertainment
manager, “Success” began managing the careers of such artists as Littles of MOBB
DEEP, Sauce Money of ROCAFELLA RECORDS, and DJ Absolut of New York’s radio
station HOT 97. He has produced, consulted, and worked with other artists such
as Ceelo Green, Busta Rhymes, DJ Kid Capri, Scott Storch, Maino, Raekwon, and
Benzino, just to name a few.
In 2006, he was the driving force behind the
success of the RICK ROSS single “HUSTLIN”. While in a Miami club “Success” heard
DJ Khaled play the song “HUSTLIN” for the first time and knew it was a hit
record. He got the song from DJ Khaled and sent it to NY Hot 97’s DJ Absolut to
play on the radio which ultimately led to RICK ROSS signing a record deal with
DEF JAM. 





The Movie
The 99 Problems movie is my debut as a writer, producer and director. I've always wanted to transition from music videos to shooting for the big screen. Many of my friends are either accomplished actors, or aspiring actors but one thing they all had in common was not finding enough work. I also felt like there was not enough opportunities for my friends so I set out to create a series of projects with this being the first of many.
99 Problems is a goofy urban comedy created for us, by us. Your contribution will not only be helping create an instant urban classic, it will be ushering in a new era in comedy. We live in what I call the ""social media"" days & times. A recent online phenomenon has made regular folks with just a smart phone and an idea become something called an ""instagram comedian"" or ""vine celebrity"" or ""social media star"". When I started this script I purposely created characters based on a cast of social media stars, mixed with solid experienced actors.

The Funding
 I am looking to raise approximately $10,000 in this first round of funding. This money will cover equipment rental, the crew (camera men, make up, sound and lighting, etc.) It will also cover the principal actors transportation and things like food services. 


The BenefitsI have decided that I wanted to add some unique perks not traditionally offered but also add the normally expected ones as well. Things like thank you credits, producer credit, speaking/non-speaking cameo, product placements, attend wrap party with the cast, etc.  The Good StuffOur principal cast has a combined social media following of almost 2 million active followers on Instagram alone. The social media marketing campaign is designed to fully take advantage of their viral power. The movie will be distributed thru most digital outlets such as Google play, iTunes, Netflix, Redbox, Hulu, and others.

The Risks

The main risks would be if we somehow fall short on creating awareness. I feel like the combination of having seasoned well-known actors, social media stars, and successful rappers turned actors will help build up the proper amount of awareness. The promotion of this movie is a well thought out plan.

<div>We are creating a feature film version of the beloved classic Grimms fairytale, <i>The Twelve Dancing Princesses</i>.  This film will have all the romance and magical enchantment of traditional feature film fairytales with a strong message of empowerment for girls.  </div>
<div>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We are also committed to diversity. 
We have the good fortune to have 12 young ladies with prominent roles in
our film and we would like them to come in all sizes, colors and ethnicities to
reflect the diversity of our audience and highlight the sisterhood between all
girls and women.</p>

</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We are reclaiming the fairytale with its original story intact.  Unlike many fairytale movies, where the depth and power of the original story have been whitewashed, we are keeping some of the darker aspects of this story intact while still creating a family friendly film for audiences of all ages to enjoy.  </div>
<div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444504468/mbmj6hwmn52nlzvflldz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
</div>
<div>Our message of feminine empowerment touches all aspects of the production.  Our writer/director is a woman who feels strongly about creating content she would be happy to show her own daughter, free from the over-sexualized images or snarky tone being marketed to young girls today.  The film itself tells the story of 12 teenage girls on the threshold of womanhood who must make tough decisions, even when it's hard, and do the right thing as they grow into the kind of young women who can feel proud of themselves and serve as models for others.  They embrace a message of sisterhood, integrity and staying true to your heart! </div>

<br/><p>Our films shape our culture and with female directors only creating 7% of the content coming out of Hollywood, the feminine perspective is rare in film.  Despite the fact that movies with female lead characters make 20% more money than those focused on male protagonists, most female filmmakers are simply not getting funded by big Hollywood studios and financiers. This is why YOU donating to our crowdfunding effort is vital.  If women help women, we can create the kind of content we all enjoy, and with the tremendous box office potential of fairytale films, such as <i>Frozen</i>, <i>Cinderella</i> and <i>Alice In Wonderland</i>, we feel our film could be very successful in the marketplace.  Our vision is to take the profits of this film to continue making female driven content and help fund other female filmmakers in the future. <br/></p>

<br/> </div> <p><br/></p></div>","About Our Film
We are creating a feature film version of the beloved classic Grimms fairytale, The Twelve Dancing Princesses.  This film will have all the romance and magical enchantment of traditional feature film fairytales with a strong message of empowerment for girls.  


We are also committed to diversity. 
We have the good fortune to have 12 young ladies with prominent roles in
our film and we would like them to come in all sizes, colors and ethnicities to
reflect the diversity of our audience and highlight the sisterhood between all
girls and women.




We are reclaiming the fairytale with its original story intact.  Unlike many fairytale movies, where the depth and power of the original story have been whitewashed, we are keeping some of the darker aspects of this story intact while still creating a family friendly film for audiences of all ages to enjoy.  




Our message of feminine empowerment touches all aspects of the production.  Our writer/director is a woman who feels strongly about creating content she would be happy to show her own daughter, free from the over-sexualized images or snarky tone being marketed to young girls today.  The film itself tells the story of 12 teenage girls on the threshold of womanhood who must make tough decisions, even when it's hard, and do the right thing as they grow into the kind of young women who can feel proud of themselves and serve as models for others.  They embrace a message of sisterhood, integrity and staying true to your heart! 



Our films shape our culture and with female directors only creating 7% of the content coming out of Hollywood, the feminine perspective is rare in film.  Despite the fact that movies with female lead characters make 20% more money than those focused on male protagonists, most female filmmakers are simply not getting funded by big Hollywood studios and financiers. This is why YOU donating to our crowdfunding effort is vital.  If women help women, we can create the kind of content we all enjoy, and with the tremendous box office potential of fairytale films, such as Frozen, Cinderella and Alice In Wonderland, we feel our film could be very successful in the marketplace.  Our vision is to take the profits of this film to continue making female driven content and help fund other female filmmakers in the future. 


Ask yourself, if things were reversed, and women created 93% of the movies we see, what would our world be like today?  




   What We'll Use The Funds For: Transparency is important to us. Making a movie of this size has considerable costs and the funds we are raising here will be put to many uses, such as:• Pre-production expenses

• Equipment underwriting
• Camera tests

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">In 1897, author H. G. Wells wrote a science-fiction novel that would inspire countless modern stories within the genre for decades and still remains a source of artistic creativity to this day. Taking cues from historical events during the threat of war in Europe and the speculation of life on Mars at the the time, Wells created an interplanetary war story told in the first-person and in a real location. With this documentary style of writing, Wells described a realistic account of how invaders from Mars lay waste to southern England in a novel comprised of two books (</span><i style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Book I: The Coming of the Martians &amp; Book II: Earth Under the Martians</i><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">) under the main novel title </span><i style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">The War of the Worlds.</i></p>

In the 118 years since the novel was first serialized in Pearson's Magazine there have been numerous adaptations of Wells' original story in all kinds of media.

<div>
<p>The only issue with all of these adaptations is one of faithfulness to Wells' original story. Changes have included the tone and feel of the story, the geographical location, the Victorian time period in which the action is set, the fighting machine design, etc.</p>
<p>None of these adaptations have been truly faithful to H. G. Wells' original story; This is where we come in...</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Production</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""></p>
<p>As huge fans of the original novel we are, like many others, disappointed with previous adaptations that have not remained faithful or presented it in such a way that the dark, often horrific tone and feel of Wells' original story becomes lost.</p>
<p>We intend to produce the <b>definitive version</b> of this wonderful classic science-fiction story as a<b>cinematic audio drama</b> <b>faithfully adapted</b> in the <b>correct period</b> from the original source; the 1898 novel. This will be achieved with a fantastic full-cast of <b>British actors</b>, immersive sound design and chilling orchestral music all mixed in <b>5.1 surround sound</b> from the outset.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<h3>What is Cinematic Audio Drama?</h3>
<p>Unlike an audiobook that is narrated by a reader, our cinematic audio drama adaptation will sound just like a blockbuster film made only for your ears! With any visual adaptation you are always forced to see someone else's interpretation of imagery. We all conjure up our own individual images and pictures in our minds when reading Wells' story. Here audio drama excels over visual drama - with a great cast, a great score and our 5.1 surround sound 'cinematic' mix - you're immersed in the action, and, as they say: the sets really ARE better in your mind!</p>
<p>The faithfulness of the adaptation, the quality of the prospective cast, and the immersive quality of the production techniques are what separates this production from others! With your help, and your input, we will bring this chilling horrific sci-fi story to life in such a unique way that we hope reviewers the world over would consider it the most convincing, most faithful and technologically imaginative version to date.</p>

<h3>My Background</h3>
<p></p>
<p>My name is Martin Johnson and I'm a professional audio drama producer, sound designer, audio editor and music composer.</p>
<p>H. G Wells' novel was one of the first books I read outside of school literature back in the 1980's. I had no idea that there were adaptations of the novel until I came across the Paramount television series and then the 1953 film. The film, although iconic and remaining one of my favorite classic sci-fi films, is far from faithful. As soon as I saw the fighting machines I thought to myself ""Well, that's not right!"", but what a brilliant design for its time.</p>
<p>From that early age, <i>The War of the Worlds</i> is something I have wanted to produce as a faithful audio drama with the dark tone and atmosphere the story deserves. It wasn't until I worked on<i>Doctor Who </i>that I began to take the idea seriously. However, I wanted to wait until my experience in the industry matured further and I had my own audio business so that the story could be adapted correctly and faithfully.</p>
<p>For the last 8 years, through my own business <a href=""http://everybodyelse.co.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Everybodyelse Productions</a>, I have provided post-production services on some of the best-regarded audio dramas in the UK. </p>
<p>I have worked with <b>Big Finish</b> on sound design, editing and music for the official <b>BBC</b> licenced <b><i>Doctor Who</i></b> audio adventures, with <b>Bafflegab</b> on <b><i>The Scarifyers</i></b> and with <b>Hammer Films</b> for their first entry in audio drama, <b><i>Hammer Chillers</i></b>.</p>
<p>In 2014, I successfully funded a Kickstarter project for my very own original cinematic audio drama, also mixed in 5.1 surround sound, called <i><b>Osiris</b>.</i> The production received very positive reviews including a 7/10 rating from Starburst Magazine. The production also made the 'Best of 2014 in Science-Fiction Audio' in the British Science Fiction Association magazine, Vector. It was directed by <b>Lisa Bowerman</b> (Big Finish) and starred <b>Christian Edwards</b> (<i>Doctor Who</i>),<b>Robert Whitelock </b>(<i>Hercules, Doctor Who</i>), <b>Liz White</b> (<i>The Woman in Black, Life on Mars</i>) with guest stars <b>Colin McFarlane</b> (<i>Batman Begins, The Dark Knight</i>) and <b>Georgia Moffett</b>(<i>Merlin, Doctor Who</i>).</p>
<p>Below is a 7-minute sample of <i>Osiris</i>, which is <b>Dolby Pro Logic II</b> surround sound encoded, and a sample of the orchestral score. <i>Please be aware that Osiris is a lot lighter in tone than 'The War of the Worlds' and these samples should only be used to get a feel for the minimum production quality expected of our project...</i></p>

<h3>The Reason Living With Strangers Is IMPORTANT!</h3>
<p>When Tracy and Carissa started writing together in 2012, the first thing they discussed was, ""Why do we want to see a show like Living with Strangers on the air?"" The Answer: ""Because we don't see ourselves or any of our friends on screen. We feel like shows about people our age/generation are completely inaccurate and DO NOT reflect the world WE live in today, especially how they DO NOT show how our friend groups are an eclectic mix of people"".</p>
<p>Living with Strangers is important because of everything Tracy and Carissa are aiming to do with the show. The is show is going to give a generation that doesn't feel like they are being heard and not understood a voice while authentically representing those who are underserved and marginalized in the U.S. because of their race, gender, sexual orientation, culture, economic status, etc;</p>
<p>The industry is finally realizing that audiences are looking for narratives that tell stories of different people. Shows like <strong>Insecure</strong>, <strong>Atlanta</strong>, <strong>Master of None</strong>, <strong>You're The Worst</strong>, <strong>Black~ish</strong>, <strong>Fresh Off The Boat</strong>, and <strong>Orange Is The New Black </strong>are pushing these boundaries and conversations, but there needs to be MORE! Living with Strangers will continue to push the uncomfortable conversations while balancing it with grounded, over the top humor. </p>
<p>So if you feel the same way as Tracy and Carissa, and want to see more shows that are funny and authentically mirror the world today and further pushes for equal representation of all people in the media and society then help make Living With Strangers a reality and DONATE.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Money Isn't The Only Way To Help</h3>
<p>If you are unable to donate, then there are other ways you can contribute. You can donate food, costumes, your time i.e. be a production assistant if you live or will be in NY during shooting, or help spread the word and get your friends and family to donate as well. We sincerely appreciate any form of help.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
</div></div>","The Creators: Tracy Ofosuhene and Carissa Pinckney

Right before graduating from NYU, Tracy had this crazy idea to create a serialized comedy based on her bizarre and crazy college experience called Living with Strangers. She partnered with her very funny and talented friend, Carissa Pinckney, an NYUer as well, to write the show and possibly bring it to life.
What was their objective? To create a funny show that...

talks about EVERYTHING (politics, sex, love, relationships, money or lack thereof, etc;)
Authentically reflects the lives of young people and gives them a voice.
gives insight and understanding of the struggles young millennials face today.
told a story about a culturally diverse and INCLUSIVE group of people.
Pushes boundaries,  destroy barriers, and breaks down societal stereotypes.
all the characters, who are otherwise marginalized and vastly underrepresented in society AND the media in some way, shape, or form, are portrayed as MULTIFACETED, MULTIDIMENSIONAL, fully formed HUMAN BEINGS.


What Happens To The Money? 
LWS is a very collaborative project with a full production team that is dedicated to making the pilot episode, but will need a lot of help to do so. LWS needs funding to:

shoot in New York City for 10 full 12hr days.
obtain permits and locations in NY.
buy flights and AirBnB stay for the producers and the creators traveling from LA to NY.
pay crew, cast, and equipment for camera, art, sound, and wardrobe department.
General Liability INSURANCE - Equipment, Car, and Worker's comp. It costs $2,904
enough supplies for make-up/hair department. Mainly basic make-up, hair, and touch ups for the actors (main, secondary AND extras/background).
food for cast and crew of over 60 people. Required to feed everyone at least 2 meals a day, breakfast and lunch.
car, prop, and clothing rental as rent cop uniforms costing $400, an ambulance rental costs $1,500, a hospital gurney costs $457.28 and cop cars cost $1,000. Pilot has two cop cars so it will cost $2,000 for the cop cars.
lockdown a production ""office"" near set locations. The office maybe a production tent.
permit for dog/animal. Also, need funds to have a trainer for the dog on set.
marketing, contracts, and music licensing
post production editing and sound.


The Reason Living With Strangers Is IMPORTANT!
When Tracy and Carissa started writing together in 2012, the first thing they discussed was, ""Why do we want to see a show like Living with Strangers on the air?"" The Answer: ""Because we don't see ourselves or any of our friends on screen. We feel like shows about people our age/generation are completely inaccurate and DO NOT reflect the world WE live in today, especially how they DO NOT show how our friend groups are an eclectic mix of people"".
Living with Strangers is important because of everything Tracy and Carissa are aiming to do with the show. The is show is going to give a generation that doesn't feel like they are being heard and not understood a voice while authentically representing those who are underserved and marginalized in the U.S. because of their race, gender, sexual orientation, culture, economic status, etc;
The industry is finally realizing that audiences are looking for narratives that tell stories of different people. Shows like Insecure, Atlanta, Master of None, You're The Worst, Black~ish, Fresh Off The Boat, and Orange Is The New Black are pushing these boundaries and conversations, but there needs to be MORE! Living with Strangers will continue to push the uncomfortable conversations while balancing it with grounded, over the top humor. 
So if you feel the same way as Tracy and Carissa, and want to see more shows that are funny and authentically mirror the world today and further pushes for equal representation of all people in the media and society then help make Living With Strangers a reality and DONATE.

Money Isn't The Only Way To Help

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for considering to support the <i>Tampa Technique </i>documentary that explores key racialized moments in Tampa’s history through the lens of Central Avenue, which was the historically black business district that was physically and symbolically demolished in 1974. The ""Tampa Technique"" was a strategic, bi-racial approach to integration different from other Southern cities that centered on economic goals through an organized, methodical approach that was praised nationally but backfired locally during key moments of disruption. This story focuses on seminal moments for blacks in Tampa ranging from lunch counter sit-ins to school integration to a 1967 civil disturbance to urban renewal that displaced and disrupted the city’s minority communities. Central Avenue was constructed through segregation and destroyed through integration, which is why it will be the hub of the story.</p>
<p>I am an instructor at the University of South Florida in mass communications and was a broadcast journalist for 12 years before moving into the university in 2012. This documentary is part of my dissertation project for my Ph.D. However, this story has become more than a project for me over the past year thanks to the remarkable people I have met who persevered through the civil rights movement as well as institutional, systematic, and structural forms of racism.</p>
<p>The contributions to this project will help cover three primary expenses (copyright, production costs, festival distribution). First, copyright material through the local newspapers and television stations will help provide the visual elements missing from this film through the eyes of journalists. These materials are expensive. For example, one-minute of video of the 1967 civil disturbances costs $2,500. Copyright-protected music is also necessary for this project. Second, production costs will go toward a co-worker who is currently helping me for free with this project because of what the story can do for the local community and the impact we think it can have on local knowledge shared by people who lived it. A small amount of production costs cover equipment, primarily memory cards to record the interviews. Third, to ensure that this story reaches a wide audience, we would like to submit it to several local, national, and international film festivals to share the story and get it distributed. One significant cost for festivals is marketing and promotional material, which include the DVDs and film post cards that you could receive as thanks for your contribution.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>The estimated expenses we hope to cover in this project will focus on direct copyright expenses ($8,000), production costs ($5,000), and festival distribution and promotion ($2,000). I realize in the long run it will cost more than this. I just hope to cover the largest potential overhead costs to ensure the best visual product. Any money that is raised beyond the $15,000 will cover additional overhead expenses for more copyright material and festival distribution, but more important, I will contribute 10% of any excess contributions to the Saunders Foundation, which is named in honor of Robert W. Saunders. Mr. Saunders was the NAACP Florida field secretary from 1952-1966 and was a Tampa native.</p>
<p>For your contribution, you will receive at least a personal shout out on the Tampa Technique Facebook page. Beyond a minimum $5 contribution, you are eligible for credit in the film, a <i>Tampa Technique </i>DVD, admission to a documentary screening, or recognition as an executive producer of the film! Additional description for what you receive for your support are outlined in the campaign details.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>This story is significant because of how the city of Tampa approached racial integration compared to other cities across the South. The Tampa Technique is unique for its methodical and orchestrated approach that was embraced by the white and black elites. However, the technique did not positively influence most of the city’s black residents. While it avoided national negative headlines, locally it backfired during the 1967 civil disturbance.</p>
<p>This narrative of underrepresented voices in the civil rights movement is like many other cities across the South. Tampa is not lumped into the national conversation regarding race relations. However, the Tampa Technique is what should be discussed based on its overall effectiveness in race relations with the goal to maintain economic upward mobility for a burgeoning Southern city at the expense of many minority residents.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>If you are not able to help with a financial contribution but you like the story we want to tell, we ask that you help spread the word through social media to anyone you think would like to help. Indiegogo allows you the share this campaign in a variety of ways. Any help you can provide is greatly appreciated.</p>

Unlike their cousins, the domestic cat, they are in fact bigger and look a little bulkier too. Domestic cats are a separate species descended from the African Wildcat (<i>Felis silvestris lybica</i>) and were brought to Britain around 3,000 years ago. The Scottish Wildcat on the other hand has been found in Scotland for the past 7,000 to 10,000 years and in fact was once native to the whole of the UK.</p><p>At a distance, Scottish Wildcats can look like big tabby cats (and are often mistaken for these). However, when you look closely you may spot these distinct differences: </p><ul>
<li>Generally <strong>larger than the average cat</strong> by up to 50%</li>
<li>
<strong>Larger head and jaws</strong>, with ears positioned on the sides of it's head rather than on top</li>
<li>A <strong>big, bushy tail </strong>with distinct rings along it and a <strong>club shaped, blunt end</strong>. This is typically shorter than the domestic cat tail too</li>
<li>
<strong>Defined stripes</strong> down it's sides and around its head. They <strong>never have spots</strong>, but do have similar coat colours to Bengals</li>
</ul><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493902429/tvrrdhadunk9ajjgxn05.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Why are you making a film about Scottish Wildcats?</strong></h3><p><i>The Tigers of Scotland</i> is a film and natural history project we felt was incredibly important to make happen. This cinematic wildlife documentary will explore the Scottish Wildcats and the lands that they call home, the myths and folklore inspired by them, as well as the efforts and the struggles to conserve this fragile species which, without proper awareness, we will lose within the next few years. There are now thought to be less than 100 of them left in the wild.</p><p>We've spent several weeks filming in the remote, far North of Scotland and have completed shooting. Production was self funded and now we're in need of your assistance to complete post production.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493904518/lkzwyqcwut8sjuuczdoy.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3> </h3><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Why are there less than 100 Scottish Wildcats left? </strong></h3><p>With less than 100 left - did you know that Scottish Wildcats are rarer than pandas, gorillas and rhinos?</p><p>For hundreds of years, Scottish Wildcats were shot and killed for doing what they do naturally – hunting birds and small mammals. Estates would proudly list in ledgers the amounts of predators and vermin killed on their land, with the biggest recorded killing on the Glengarry estate in 1840. 198 Scottish Wildcats are listed to have been killed on the estate in a four year period -<strong><i> that's</i><i> double the number currently estimated to exist in the wild today.</i></strong> Gamekeepers are generally now much more open and interested in ensuring their activities are wildlife friendly than they were 150 years ago, though mistakes can be made.<strong> </strong>As humans continue to build roads through their territories, being hit by a vehicle is now much more likely than persecution.</p><p>Another problem is habitat loss, mostly caused by us humans. While they are quite adaptable creatures, humans are constantly changing the landscape and the Wildcats just can't keep up. Areas that just 40 years ago were perfect habitats for the Wildcats and many other creatures have been destroyed by people, so they adapted to the new landscape and now people are once again talking about changing that environment.</p><p>Domestic and feral cats however are now their biggest threat. As they are genetic cousins, they can breed with domestic cats and produce fertile offspring. There are many dangers to this, but the main one is that we're simply losing a species through poor and diluted genetics. In addition, unvaccinated domestic and feral cats can transmit diseases that Wildcats wouldn't have otherwise come into contact with.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493905693/lz1fofxkmg6285zgukvi.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Why have I never heard of Scottish Wildcats before?</strong></h3><p>It's possible that you might not have heard of them because we Brits in particular like to hear about more exotic animals on other continents; sometimes that means that the wonderful wildlife in our own country is easily overlooked.</p><p>Furthermore, these animals are incredibly elusive and difficult to find. Many of the locals in the areas we've been filming had no idea they even had wildcats on their doorstep or simply had never seen them in all their years living there. Not only are they shy, stealthy animals, but their sheer lack of numbers only compounds their obscurity.</p><p>People may also be confused with domestic tabby cats or Bengals - and as glances are often fleeting, a person might not realise that it was actually Wildcat they had seen. Equally, it's just as easy to mistake a Bengal or tabby cat for a Wildcat with a fleeting glance too.</p><p> </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><b>What's the campaign for?</b></h3><p>The campaign directly funds the amazing team we have assembled to help piece together the film in the best possible way.

Unlike their cousins, the domestic cat, they are in fact bigger and look a little bulkier too. Domestic cats are a separate species descended from the African Wildcat (Felis silvestris lybica) and were brought to Britain around 3,000 years ago. The Scottish Wildcat on the other hand has been found in Scotland for the past 7,000 to 10,000 years and in fact was once native to the whole of the UK.At a distance, Scottish Wildcats can look like big tabby cats (and are often mistaken for these). However, when you look closely you may spot these distinct differences: 
Generally larger than the average cat by up to 50%

Larger head and jaws, with ears positioned on the sides of it's head rather than on top
A big, bushy tail with distinct rings along it and a club shaped, blunt end. This is typically shorter than the domestic cat tail too

Defined stripes down it's sides and around its head. They never have spots, but do have similar coat colours to Bengals
 Why are you making a film about Scottish Wildcats?The Tigers of Scotland is a film and natural history project we felt was incredibly important to make happen. This cinematic wildlife documentary will explore the Scottish Wildcats and the lands that they call home, the myths and folklore inspired by them, as well as the efforts and the struggles to conserve this fragile species which, without proper awareness, we will lose within the next few years. There are now thought to be less than 100 of them left in the wild.We've spent several weeks filming in the remote, far North of Scotland and have completed shooting. Production was self funded and now we're in need of your assistance to complete post production. Why are there less than 100 Scottish Wildcats left? With less than 100 left - did you know that Scottish Wildcats are rarer than pandas, gorillas and rhinos?For hundreds of years, Scottish Wildcats were shot and killed for doing what they do naturally – hunting birds and small mammals. Estates would proudly list in ledgers the amounts of predators and vermin killed on their land, with the biggest recorded killing on the Glengarry estate in 1840. 198 Scottish Wildcats are listed to have been killed on the estate in a four year period - that's double the number currently estimated to exist in the wild today. Gamekeepers are generally now much more open and interested in ensuring their activities are wildlife friendly than they were 150 years ago, though mistakes can be made. As humans continue to build roads through their territories, being hit by a vehicle is now much more likely than persecution.Another problem is habitat loss, mostly caused by us humans. While they are quite adaptable creatures, humans are constantly changing the landscape and the Wildcats just can't keep up. Areas that just 40 years ago were perfect habitats for the Wildcats and many other creatures have been destroyed by people, so they adapted to the new landscape and now people are once again talking about changing that environment.Domestic and feral cats however are now their biggest threat. As they are genetic cousins, they can breed with domestic cats and produce fertile offspring. There are many dangers to this, but the main one is that we're simply losing a species through poor and diluted genetics. In addition, unvaccinated domestic and feral cats can transmit diseases that Wildcats wouldn't have otherwise come into contact with. Why have I never heard of Scottish Wildcats before?It's possible that you might not have heard of them because we Brits in particular like to hear about more exotic animals on other continents; sometimes that means that the wonderful wildlife in our own country is easily overlooked.Furthermore, these animals are incredibly elusive and difficult to find. Many of the locals in the areas we've been filming had no idea they even had wildcats on their doorstep or simply had never seen them in all their years living there. Not only are they shy, stealthy animals, but their sheer lack of numbers only compounds their obscurity.People may also be confused with domestic tabby cats or Bengals - and as glances are often fleeting, a person might not realise that it was actually Wildcat they had seen. Equally, it's just as easy to mistake a Bengal or tabby cat for a Wildcat with a fleeting glance too. What's the campaign for?The campaign directly funds the amazing team we have assembled to help piece together the film in the best possible way. Whilst it might have been possible for us to have edited the film ourselves, hiring professionals means the film will be completed and polished to the highest possible standard.Whilst we've self funded production, we need help with post production which is where you can help. In order to be as clear as possible about where the contributions will be going, we've created the below chart to show you how and where we're distributing the funding. How does this project help the Wildcats?As part of our campaign, we pledge to donate 5% of what we receive to two of our favourite charities: Aigas Field Centre and Five Sisters Zoo. Both organisations have been a major part in the production of the film and your contribution will directly go towards caring for the Scottish Wildcats. Whatever perk you choose, not only will you be assisting in completing the film, but your generosity will be helping to save the Wildcats themselves.Aigas Field Centre is part of the Scottish Wildcat breeding programme.

<br/>THANK YOU</h2><p>Additional questions? Call the office at 702-907-0220.</p><p> </p></div>","FIRST (STORY):You can read the script here.  SECOND (PITCH): The pitch video is über short because some people only need the meat and potatoes. However, if you want the full, 22-page treatment on the film's tone, picture, editing, timeline, budget, crew, and the whole enchilada, then you can read the fully-loaded, super-detailed treatment for this project here OR scroll down below to see selected parts of it. THIRD (FUNDS):We've already raised funds for the ambulance, EMT's, police cars, uniforms, and food for 3.5 days of shooting. We're now raising funds for the cast, crew, locations, & temporary equipment insurance - if we fall short on this goal here on Indiegogo, we'll make up the balance with outside investors.  FULL RUNDOWN Much of the first 11-12 minutes of this noirish pilot takes place at night. Visually, it will involve a lot of dark (pitch black) and muted art direction as our heroine, Joy Malcolm (30’s, single), is an ex-Air Force medic battling through PTSD. She is desensitized to matters of life and death due to experiences during her overseas war zone toursAs this is a pilot, the antagonist Baal (40’s - 50’s) will be introduced early on, and he represents darkness in the town and in the story. He always wears a 3-piece suit, has a morbid sense of humor, always carries a newspaper, and employs a large group of fallen angels who are equally muted and devoid of light.On the other hand, Joy does encounter the archangel Michael in the first 12 minutes, and he is in every sense of the word the antithesis of the antagonist. His upbeat outlook is the lone source of optimism in Joy’s rundown world.Colors will be mostly dark, muted, and even light sources will be green/blue to strip the viewer of any sense of warmth.   We’re going to shoot for 42 hours, spread across 3.5 days to have ample coverage of the 11-12 minutes. While each scene builds on the previous scene as Joy sequentially discovers her gift, the pacing of this story closely follows that of a Sergio Leone spaghetti western: slow, with long takes, sparse dialogue, and wide shots to allow the environment to build tension. This is intentional, to underscore the muted and dark tonality of Joy’s world.I shoot for the edit since I will do the editing myself. From the moment I step on location, I’m ready to go with a detailed battle plan to squeeze the most out of our shoot times. With rare, isolated exceptions, my teams do not go over shoot times and we manage to get all of our coverage.  Visually, I’d like to approach this story with an abundance of traditional, locked down cinematography.

He meets a rabbi when the rabbi’s teenage son is getting ready for Bar Mitzvah. The old man and young boy go through the learning and preparation together. But it means something very different for them both…</p><p>During their practices Gyuri starts to allow himself to remember and talk about the things he kept as a secret for 70 years. He recalls the eve of his own passage to manhood, when he joined the millions of others who entered the gates of Auschwitz. Luckily, Gyuri was strong and tall for his age, and he followed the advice of the first man he met in the crowded wagon: he had to tell the Nazis that he was 15 and not 13, thus being able to join an adult working group and not the queue for the gas chambers where most children of his age would go. Somehow, he survived and managed to get back home to Budapest. The rabbi’s son, Shalom, an innocent 13 year old boy, is full of dreams and hopes, and reminds Gyuri of his lost childhood. When the rabbi and the child allow the old man to experience the ritual of their everyday lives they somehow introduce him to an alternative universe - a world which could have been his - if only history could have taken another course.</p><p> </p><p><strong>OUR MISSION</strong></p><p>Our film is meant to be timely and relevant because the world is not getting any better in 2017. People are very much in need of finding micro communities to enhance the quality of their lives. By using humor we hope our viewers will laugh and yet feel the heavy sense of loss and redemption. The tragedy of Gyuri is in the past, yet life and love goes on around him and becomes central to his own existence - and shows how life and love will always triumph. It is never too late for anyone, no matter how badly scarred or damaged they are, to open his or her own heart and mind.</p><p> </p><p><strong>DIRECTOR'S NOTE</strong></p><p>I am very much dedicated to making films against prejudice.

This includes making our environment and characters look unique and realistic. We need your help to make this possible!  Big essentials on sets are coffee, trash bags, and especially hand warmers since it’s Upstate New York.  All in all, this money will be going towards wardrobe, props, and everyday production essentials.  Please help keep our crew energized and warm!</p><h3>Effects: $200</h3><p>To dish out the sci-fi/horror look to the film, we need to acquire effects materials! That includes smoke machines, makeup, gas, eye drops, and a multitude of other things.</p><h3>Food: $1,200</h3><p>Keeping the crew fed is important! Working mostly at night, our actors and crew members will tough it out in negative-degree weather in the middle of the winter. They do love a good cup of soup, so your donation helps us provide it for them!</p><h3>Insurance and Transportation: $600</h3><p>Film equipment is very expensive and even more fragile. Film sets are very unpredictable, especially with the crazy weather in Upstate New York, so keeping the film equipment secure in any dangerous situation is always important.

This includes making our environment and characters look unique and realistic. We need your help to make this possible!  Big essentials on sets are coffee, trash bags, and especially hand warmers since it’s Upstate New York.  All in all, this money will be going towards wardrobe, props, and everyday production essentials.  Please help keep our crew energized and warm!Effects: $200To dish out the sci-fi/horror look to the film, we need to acquire effects materials! That includes smoke machines, makeup, gas, eye drops, and a multitude of other things.Food: $1,200Keeping the crew fed is important! Working mostly at night, our actors and crew members will tough it out in negative-degree weather in the middle of the winter. They do love a good cup of soup, so your donation helps us provide it for them!Insurance and Transportation: $600Film equipment is very expensive and even more fragile. Film sets are very unpredictable, especially with the crazy weather in Upstate New York, so keeping the film equipment secure in any dangerous situation is always important.
