<p><b>Moving Examples of Sportsmanship</b></p>
<p>Examples of true sportsmanship are often so moving that they're remembered long after the game (or the season) ends. </p>

<p><i>Elementary school student Hugo Leuchars was playing for the New York Fusions Kings U10 soccer team, and they were behind, 4-3, in a 2013 game. With about five minutes left, Hugo found himself on a one-on-one breakaway. He unloaded a hard shot at the goalkeeper, who blocked the kick with his stomach and immediately fell to the ground in obvious pain. Though Hugo could have taken the easy shot at an empty goal, tying the game, Hugo chose instead to check on the injured goalkeeper as defenders kicked the ball out of bounds. </i></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>In June, 2012, high school junior Meghan Vogel was running last in the 3200-meter state finals when the runner ahead of her collapsed. Instead of racing past Arden McMath and avoiding a career-first—a last place finish—Vogel stopped and picked up her exhausted competitor. Vogel carried McMath the final 20 meters to the finish line, making sure that McMath finished ahead of herself.</i></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>In November, 2011, High school rowers James Konopka and Nick Mead were likely to finish in the medals when one of their opponents' boats capsized in the river's 45-degree water. Abandoning the race, the pair turned into rescuers, waiting with the capsized rowers until a launch arrived. They resumed the race, finishing in last place.</i></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>In 2009, high school senior Johntel Franklin showed up to his high school basketball game in the second quarter. He had lost his mother to cancer earlier in the day. Because his name wasn't listed in the scorebook, Franklin was assessed a technical foul. Knowing the situation, the opposing coach was forced—against his wishes—to send in one of his players to take the free throws. Darius McNeal went to the line...and missed both shots on purpose.</i></p>

</div>""Witches revenge"" is the sequel to ""Bloodline"".<p></p>
<p>Spellbound Chronicles tells the story of Larna and Aron who, while geocaching in the ancient Sherwood Forest, find themselves reluctantly pulled through time into a Sherwood of the future. Faced with the task of fighting to save an enslaved and fast-mutating race from extinction, they set out with the formidable wizard, Balgaire, and his friends to take on the might of the fearsome warlock, Mordrog.</p>
<p>A battle for wands, destruction and kidnapping ensues, with a hint of romance thrown in, in the form of underground shape shifter Cai. As the final epic battle takes place, will Larna and Aron survive the fight long enough to return unscathed to their own time and their own Sherwood..?</p>

</div> <p>Hi my name is Eve Maguire. I am the mother of Suzanne Maguire. Suzanne has been living with MND/ALS for the last 13 years. When she was diagnosed the doctors gave her less than 4 years to live. Because of her writing and he determination to leave a legacy for her two boys, Lance and Aron, she has stayed strong and is still with us. </p>
<p>Her recent visit to the hospital wasn't the best, so time isn't on our side. I want to do everything I can to make her dream, of the Spellbound Chronicles Trilogy being a success and leaving a legacy for her family, happen.</p>
<p>We have spent the last 12 years developing ideas, writing and getting our first book ""The Spellbound Chronicles: Bloodline"" self published but we have hit a brick wall. I remortgaged my house to get the money together to get her ideas in print and now everyone has had their share, there is no more to get the second book published and marketed.</p>
<p>This is where you wonderful patrons can help.</p>
<p>This campaign is for your assistance in getting the second book ""Witches Revenge"" to print.</p>
<p>This is our first campaign and hopefully it won't be our last.</p>

<p>To say a huge thank you for your exceptional generosity, you will receive copies of all the books, all the limited edition prints, a huge huge thank you. plus .....</p>
<p>A day in Sherwood Forest with Eve, Suzanne and Pete. A walk around the Forest and a lovely meal to chat with us about our journey.</p>
<p>If you are in the UK, we arrange transport, but if you are outside the UK, you will have to make your way to meet us.</p>
<p>If, for any reason, you cannot make it to Sherwood Forest, we can arrange a Skype call with you and your family to chat about the books, our journey and story in person.</p>
<p>We will also arrange for Peter to create a piece of original artwork from the book, signed by us all.</p>
<p>We look forward to seeing you.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>If we all manage to get these books published for Suzanne and her boys, it will make everything we have been through over the last 12 years worth it. There have been some very emotional times and some absolutely aw-inspiring times. But for Suzanne to be able to leave the legacy of the Spellbound Chronicles to the boys would be the best gift ever.</p>
<p>We would love for you to help us with this. We want you to become a part of the happier times we have had.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>We have had some struggle over the years with printers upping their prices, our first illustrator not giving us what you wanted and PR companies promising the world, but we have learned so much.</p>
<p>The most important lesson we have learned is; where to invest our available capital and that's with the people who are in this with us. </p>
<p>Along our journey we have met some, not-so-helpful people, some very greedy people and some extremely wonderful/helpful ones. We have kept the wonderful/helpful ones close and, like us, they are in this to make it a success for Suzanne.</p>
<p>The risks and challenges we perceive are;</p>
<p>1. Suzanne not quite making it to complete book three before the end of the year. We will over come this by working together, as we always do, to get all the ideas and stories she has written down.</p>
<p>2. A small increase in paper costs from now till the book is published. We promise, this will not impact on you getting your book or your merchandise. We have factored in a potential 3-6% increase.</p>
<p>3. Although I have set a date for shipping to be in June 2015, I really cannot guarantee that. Since the novel still needs some editing to be perfect, we cannot guarantee an absolute definitive release date.  It may take more editing and rewrites than we think to polish, and finish, the second book in the trilogy.  We will keep everyone updated on the progress of the editing, and further updates on when we will have the book in our hands.</p>
<p>We have already encountered cost increases on all areas of our Self-publishing journey and have gained the knowledge to manage everything ourselves. That way we keep the cost of the books low and accessible to all.</p>
<p>We welcome and questions you may have. Please feel free to contact us. info@spellboundchronicles.co.uk</p>
<p></p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Shipping</h3>
<p>All perks include shipping within the UK via Royal Mail.  International orders will ship Royal Mail International post please add the extra amount required to cover the additional cost of shipping outside the UK.</p>

Spellbound Chronicles tells the story of Larna and Aron who, while geocaching in the ancient Sherwood Forest, find themselves reluctantly pulled through time into a Sherwood of the future. Faced with the task of fighting to save an enslaved and fast-mutating race from extinction, they set out with the formidable wizard, Balgaire, and his friends to take on the might of the fearsome warlock, Mordrog.
A battle for wands, destruction and kidnapping ensues, with a hint of romance thrown in, in the form of underground shape shifter Cai. As the final epic battle takes place, will Larna and Aron survive the fight long enough to return unscathed to their own time and their own Sherwood..?

Our story


 Hi my name is Eve Maguire. I am the mother of Suzanne Maguire. Suzanne has been living with MND/ALS for the last 13 years. When she was diagnosed the doctors gave her less than 4 years to live. Because of her writing and he determination to leave a legacy for her two boys, Lance and Aron, she has stayed strong and is still with us. 
Her recent visit to the hospital wasn't the best, so time isn't on our side. I want to do everything I can to make her dream, of the Spellbound Chronicles Trilogy being a success and leaving a legacy for her family, happen.
We have spent the last 12 years developing ideas, writing and getting our first book ""The Spellbound Chronicles: Bloodline"" self published but we have hit a brick wall. I remortgaged my house to get the money together to get her ideas in print and now everyone has had their share, there is no more to get the second book published and marketed.
This is where you wonderful patrons can help.
This campaign is for your assistance in getting the second book ""Witches Revenge"" to print.
This is our first campaign and hopefully it won't be our last.

 
 
  What We Need  We need only £9000 to get 1500 copies of ""Witches Revenge"" printed, pay our amazing editor, Gordon Volke - and our extremely talented illustrator, Peter Jarvis - to complete the artwork for the book and the new web comic.
Here is our breakdown of the costs.
Print and Delivery: £2495.00
Editor: £2400.00
Illustration: £1250.00.
Marketing / Promotion: £2855.00 

If, for any reason, we don't reach our target, we will work tirelessly to sell the merchandise we print to raise the remainder of the capital needed. Peter will also create beautiful pieces of original artwork to sell or auction to raise the remainder,
Whatever the case, we will make sure we reach our goal to make book two a success.

What You Get
Everyone who helps us will receive a PDF copy of the first book and the second book (once completed), no matter how much you pledge. We want to give something back to say a huge thank you.
Patrons who pledge more will receive even more amazing perks including; signed copies of the books, T-shirts, limited edition signed illustration prints and much more.

A day in Sherwood Forest with Eve, Suzanne and Pete. A walk around the Forest and a lovely meal to chat with us about our journey.
If you are in the UK, we arrange transport, but if you are outside the UK, you will have to make your way to meet us.
If, for any reason, you cannot make it to Sherwood Forest, we can arrange a Skype call with you and your family to chat about the books, our journey and story in person.
We will also arrange for Peter to create a piece of original artwork from the book, signed by us all.
We look forward to seeing you.
    The Impact If we all manage to get these books published for Suzanne and her boys, it will make everything we have been through over the last 12 years worth it. There have been some very emotional times and some absolutely aw-inspiring times. But for Suzanne to be able to leave the legacy of the Spellbound Chronicles to the boys would be the best gift ever.
We would love for you to help us with this. We want you to become a part of the happier times we have had.
    Risks & Challenges We have had some struggle over the years with printers upping their prices, our first illustrator not giving us what you wanted and PR companies promising the world, but we have learned so much.
The most important lesson we have learned is; where to invest our available capital and that's with the people who are in this with us. 
Along our journey we have met some, not-so-helpful people, some very greedy people and some extremely wonderful/helpful ones. We have kept the wonderful/helpful ones close and, like us, they are in this to make it a success for Suzanne.
The risks and challenges we perceive are;
1. Suzanne not quite making it to complete book three before the end of the year. We will over come this by working together, as we always do, to get all the ideas and stories she has written down.
2. A small increase in paper costs from now till the book is published. We promise, this will not impact on you getting your book or your merchandise. We have factored in a potential 3-6% increase.
3. Although I have set a date for shipping to be in June 2015, I really cannot guarantee that. Since the novel still needs some editing to be perfect, we cannot guarantee an absolute definitive release date.  It may take more editing and rewrites than we think to polish, and finish, the second book in the trilogy.  We will keep everyone updated on the progress of the editing, and further updates on when we will have the book in our hands.
We have already encountered cost increases on all areas of our Self-publishing journey and have gained the knowledge to manage everything ourselves. That way we keep the cost of the books low and accessible to all.
We welcome and questions you may have. Please feel free to contact us. info@spellboundchronicles.co.uk


Shipping
All perks include shipping within the UK via Royal Mail.  International orders will ship Royal Mail International post please add the extra amount required to cover the additional cost of shipping outside the UK.

Life on the streets can be tough, going without food and water, spending nights in the cold, living your life in open spaces (without any privacy). It can weigh in heavy on anyone, and unfortunately the solution to this problem (homelessness) is not very clear.</p><p>From a very young age, I realized that there was stark contrast between people; the difference in their characteristics, the elements that elevate or decline their social, economic, artistic or intellectual status and issues and behaviors that were in-tune to my inner dislike.  Therefore, I tried to sympathize with the homeless and close the gap in order to understand them.  For example, on my way to school, I would dirty up my new shoes, just to blend in and show that I am not very different from them.</p><p>Throughout the 2009 post-election ""<strong>Green movement</strong>"" demonstrations and social disturbances in Iran, I was an activist and journalist.  My biggest fear was to be arrested by the authorities.  Afraid to be followed, I spent numerous nights away from my home.  Some of those nights, I spent in public spaces such as parks, bus and rail stations in my hometown, Tehran.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499200734/hmlzswrqslbgcru1hcwx.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>I heard about “<strong>Occupy DC</strong>” after I arrived in the US in 2011. I started filming and taking pictures of the movement in DC, where I met a lot of homeless people. Observing, listening and talking to the homeless started to transform me much more than I, or anyone else for that matter, anticipated. It was as if taking pictures of the homeless people, opened up the gates to a whole new world for me. A world, previously unknown to me.</p><p> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499200791/vpk83kyptjwa7b3qaxog.jpg"" src=""""/><br/><i>""Occupy DC""</i></p><p>With my earlier experiences in photography both in Iran and later in the United States, focusing mainly on social issues, I developed a new interest in portrait and fashion photography. <strong>I setup my first home photo studio in my modest apartment</strong>.

The phrase coins a whole new meaning when average Joes are compared to the homeless people living in front of Washington DC’s train station and even more so when New York’s fifth avenue, beautiful slim models dressed in pricey clothes are compared to the homeless who live only a few blocks away.</p><p>The sharp contrast ignited the initial temptation for me to start this project. There is a homeless camp next to I95 highway called the “Blue Camp.”  It is ironically situated between Washington DC and New York City.  <strong>This is where I started the project.</strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499200819/raovl0fyd5dvyz5kkuz7.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>“<strong>Beyond the Highways</strong>” is the name that I chose for my project.  I want to show that every homeless man is a handsome King, a caring hero, a husband, son or brother and every homeless woman is a beautiful queen, a gorgeous model, a wife, a sister, a daughter and a creator of mankind.  <br/><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499177010/w1zsb8xnqvwodpqvlezu.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p><p>So, I talked to the homeless and told them that I want them to model for me.  I want to see, if for a moment we can trade places of the homeless people with models.</p><p><strong>In the first part of the project</strong>, each person tells the story of his/her past and present and his/her plans for the future.

<li>Purchase of a Canon 5D IV camera and related lens</li>
<li>Publication and Print costs for the book</li>
<li>Homeless people transportation to the studio</li>
<li>Introduction and submission costs for introducing the book to major international festivals</li>
<li>Film editing, sound design, sound mixing and video post-production costs</li>

I want to humanize these homeless people, who are so often dehumanized by our society, and show the world a path forward.</p><p><strong>My main goal in this project is to reveal the beauty that might not be seen because of our insensitivity.</strong> I would like to highlight that the <strong>black</strong> color could be an outcome of unwanted circumstances; <strong>grey</strong> could represent the hard conditions, while <strong>white</strong> symbolizes hopefulness of life. The project tends to show that all people deserve respect and they are all born equal with dignity and rights.</p><p>I would like to emphasize throughout the book and the documentary my respect for all human beings, to criticize the conventional approach of people to these two groups of the society, and to ask people to rethink of their prejudgments of any specific group or individuals. Listening to various stories of the interviewees warns us that same story could happen to anyone, that each one of us could come across such experiences in life due to the circumstances that are beyond one’s will and control.</p><p>The book takes us to a journey into the past and present life and the future dreams of a homeless. In the photos where s/he imagines her/himself as a model, bright and strong sparks of hope are visible.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1500387676/kiwhdypsozgrlz7jmwoc.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3><p>It has been tough to find people who are willing to participate in this project, as homeless people usually avoid appearing in the media. As such, we have worked with people not only in DC area but in other cities as well. Another challenge that we faced was finding a place to conduct our interviews and to produce the documentary in. A Woodbridge church and a RCC office have both been integral in this regard.</p><p> </p><p><strong>We want this project to be unique. We also want the project to have an emotional impact on people, a very similar impact that I received while working on the project.</strong></p><p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499176550/i8peoba0tcwqzg5yursh.png"" src=""""/></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>P.S.</strong> This story is deeply personal to me, as I myself have been homeless twice, even for short time, once in 2009 and another time in 2016. I have tasted the desperation of homelessness and felt what it is like to be discarded by society.

Life on the streets can be tough, going without food and water, spending nights in the cold, living your life in open spaces (without any privacy). It can weigh in heavy on anyone, and unfortunately the solution to this problem (homelessness) is not very clear.From a very young age, I realized that there was stark contrast between people; the difference in their characteristics, the elements that elevate or decline their social, economic, artistic or intellectual status and issues and behaviors that were in-tune to my inner dislike.  Therefore, I tried to sympathize with the homeless and close the gap in order to understand them.  For example, on my way to school, I would dirty up my new shoes, just to blend in and show that I am not very different from them.Throughout the 2009 post-election ""Green movement"" demonstrations and social disturbances in Iran, I was an activist and journalist.  My biggest fear was to be arrested by the authorities.  Afraid to be followed, I spent numerous nights away from my home.  Some of those nights, I spent in public spaces such as parks, bus and rail stations in my hometown, Tehran.I heard about “Occupy DC” after I arrived in the US in 2011. I started filming and taking pictures of the movement in DC, where I met a lot of homeless people. Observing, listening and talking to the homeless started to transform me much more than I, or anyone else for that matter, anticipated. It was as if taking pictures of the homeless people, opened up the gates to a whole new world for me. A world, previously unknown to me. ""Occupy DC""With my earlier experiences in photography both in Iran and later in the United States, focusing mainly on social issues, I developed a new interest in portrait and fashion photography. I setup my first home photo studio in my modest apartment. One documentary and a few modelling photography projects are among the outcomes of those days.Moving to the US, imprinted a well-known phrase in my grey cells “Us and Them.”  People are regularly judged and segregated based on the color of their skin, appearances, accent and even color of their hair. The phrase coins a whole new meaning when average Joes are compared to the homeless people living in front of Washington DC’s train station and even more so when New York’s fifth avenue, beautiful slim models dressed in pricey clothes are compared to the homeless who live only a few blocks away.The sharp contrast ignited the initial temptation for me to start this project. There is a homeless camp next to I95 highway called the “Blue Camp.”  It is ironically situated between Washington DC and New York City.  This is where I started the project.“Beyond the Highways” is the name that I chose for my project.  I want to show that every homeless man is a handsome King, a caring hero, a husband, son or brother and every homeless woman is a beautiful queen, a gorgeous model, a wife, a sister, a daughter and a creator of mankind.  So, I talked to the homeless and told them that I want them to model for me.  I want to see, if for a moment we can trade places of the homeless people with models.In the first part of the project, each person tells the story of his/her past and present and his/her plans for the future. They sit in front of the camera with a black, gray and white (which resembles hope) background.In the second part of the project, each person is asked to think of him/herself as a model and to strike poses in front of the camera and to act in whatever style they choose to. My plan is to publish a book that includes the photos of people whose homelessness has been the result of circumstances outside of their control.In addition to the book, we are developing a mobile-phone app to go along with the book.  The reader can scan the code next to each interviewee in the book and a 3-5 minute long video of that person would be shown on the app.In addition, readers and contributor comments would be available on the app for each interviewee.  To top it off, I also include a documentary on how “Beyond the Highway” was made. What I Need & What You GetSo far, I have spent all of my savings on this project.  Yet the total cost for the project is $28,250.00.  That is why I turned to Indiegogo to reach you and raise the needed funds that would be spent on the following:
Purchase of a Canon 5D IV camera and related lens
Publication and Print costs for the book
Homeless people transportation to the studio
Introduction and submission costs for introducing the book to major international festivals
Film editing, sound design, sound mixing and video post-production costs
 The Expected ImpactIt is next to impossible to state what potential impact would this project have on the lives of these less fortunate people living amongst us.Just as I dirtied my shoes when I was a kid, I want to use this project to obscure the socioeconomic lines that divide us. I want to humanize these homeless people, who are so often dehumanized by our society, and show the world a path forward.My main goal in this project is to reveal the beauty that might not be seen because of our insensitivity. I would like to highlight that the black color could be an outcome of unwanted circumstances; grey could represent the hard conditions, while white symbolizes hopefulness of life. The project tends to show that all people deserve respect and they are all born equal with dignity and rights.I would like to emphasize throughout the book and the documentary my respect for all human beings, to criticize the conventional approach of people to these two groups of the society, and to ask people to rethink of their prejudgments of any specific group or individuals. Listening to various stories of the interviewees warns us that same story could happen to anyone, that each one of us could come across such experiences in life due to the circumstances that are beyond one’s will and control.The book takes us to a journey into the past and present life and the future dreams of a homeless. In the photos where s/he imagines her/himself as a model, bright and strong sparks of hope are visible.Risks & ChallengesIt has been tough to find people who are willing to participate in this project, as homeless people usually avoid appearing in the media. As such, we have worked with people not only in DC area but in other cities as well. Another challenge that we faced was finding a place to conduct our interviews and to produce the documentary in. A Woodbridge church and a RCC office have both been integral in this regard. We want this project to be unique. We also want the project to have an emotional impact on people, a very similar impact that I received while working on the project. P.S. This story is deeply personal to me, as I myself have been homeless twice, even for short time, once in 2009 and another time in 2016. I have tasted the desperation of homelessness and felt what it is like to be discarded by society. As such, I empathize with these people in a very real way, and I strive to ensure that my empathy shines through in every part of this project. I want people to understand the experience of homelessness. Here are the Perks!

<h3>Who is the founder of AMAZN and why is this publication necessary?</h3>
<p>Hi, Pranav Iyer here! A little background on me if you don't know who I am -- I am a former Indian American collegiate football player who witnessed firsthand the struggles of being such a drastic minority in the sport. Through the lack of representation, constant stereotypes, and my own culture’s expectations and norms, I was the last person people expected to have dreams in a sport that wasn’t table tennis, badminton, or cricket. Along the ride, I was ridiculed and made a mockery of through slurs and disses, from the stereotypical ‘go back to math class’ to ‘Slumdog Millionaire.' I saw so many of my peers grow up with similar sports dreams as I did, only to have them dashed because of their own lack of faith or pressure from their surrounding communities.</p>
<p>See, a lot of this boils down to representation (yes, I know it's such an overused word). But even though there isn't a significant presence of Asian Americans at the highest levels of sports, for those that make it to that level, they usually go completely under the radar. How do I know this? Over the past year, I have dedicated much of my time to uncovering these stories and I realized that there are so many cases of underreported stars walking right in front of us -- the types of examples that would have given my peers and so many other Asian American youth the assurance that they can succeed in an unconventional field as well. If you want to check out those stories to get a better sense of the vastness of the community and what inspired me to launch this publication, feel free to check out these links: The Rise of Asian American Basketball (<a href=""http://getsportsfocus.com/High_School-detail/the-rise-of-asian-american-basketball/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://getsportsfocus.com/High_School-detail/th...</a>), 0.4% - The Struggle, Identity and Pride of Asian Americans in Football (<a href=""http://getsportsfocus.com/High_School-detail/the-struggle-identity-and-pride-of-asian-americans-in-football3/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://getsportsfocus.com/High_School-detail/th...</a>)</p>
<p>Since the existence of the Asian American diaspora, the community has been greatly underserved in so many regards, especially media. That is why AMAZN's mission is to give a voice to perpetually undercovered and misrepresented Asian American athletes with the intention to accurately portray the community, eradicate misinformed stereotypes and instigate inspiration for the next generation of Asian American youth.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What type of content will be featured and who will be covered?</h3>
<p>AMAZN will consist of a website (AMAZNHQ.com) and social media platforms, including YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. The website will be the host to video, written, and audio content.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Video<ul><li>Player highlights, player profiles, event recaps, and short documentaries</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Written<ul><li>National news, player profiles, columns, long-form issue stories, and Player Tribune-type pieces</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Audio <ul><li>Podcasts, interviews</li></ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WHO</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>High school athletes</li>
<li>College athletes</li>
<li>Domestic and overseas professional athletes</li>
<li>Asian American sports leagues and tournaments</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why I am asking for your help</h3>
<p>This is a startup publication, but I don't want it to seem like one. My plan is to get this venture off and running from day one. Here are some of the upfront costs that I am dealing with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Equipment<ul><li>Camera, lenses, tripods, hard drives, and microphones </li></ul>
</li>
<li>Website<ul><li>Domain, and hosting</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Travel<ul><li>Transportation cost for commute throughout California and potentially elsewhere</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Staff (future)<ul><li>Pay reporters, designers, and others for their work down the road</li></ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At this moment, this is a one-man project. However, I am seeking the help of volunteer reporters who are passionate about the cause. And hopefully, this can be a larger operation in the future so that the diaspora residing all around the country can be fully covered. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>How you can help</h3>
<p>Obviously, the most tangible way of helping my vision is through donating to the cause -- any amount helps! But I understand that, even if this is a cause you are passionate about, you may not be in a place right now where you can pitch in monetarily. And that is completely fine!</p>
<p>Here are other ways to help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share this campaign on social media</li>
<li>Spread the word of the publication</li>
<li>Volunteer yourself or refer other Asian American reporters to help further coverage</li>
<li>View and share content</li>
<li>Pitch me story ideas</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>I am also seeking sponsorships from organizations that actively seek to promote the Asian American narrative. So if you would like to partner in that way or know of organizations that would potentially be interested, please contact me!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Where you can find AMAZN (after it's launched)</h3>

<p>Whether you can help out or not, I am greatly thankful that you took your time reading through my vision! Now let's rewrite the narrative one step at a time!</p>

If you want to check out those stories to get a better sense of the vastness of the community and what inspired me to launch this publication, feel free to check out these links: The Rise of Asian American Basketball (http://getsportsfocus.com/High_School-detail/th...), 0.4% - The Struggle, Identity and Pride of Asian Americans in Football (http://getsportsfocus.com/High_School-detail/th...)
Since the existence of the Asian American diaspora, the community has been greatly underserved in so many regards, especially media. That is why AMAZN's mission is to give a voice to perpetually undercovered and misrepresented Asian American athletes with the intention to accurately portray the community, eradicate misinformed stereotypes and instigate inspiration for the next generation of Asian American youth.
 

What type of content will be featured and who will be covered?
AMAZN will consist of a website (AMAZNHQ.com) and social media platforms, including YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. The website will be the host to video, written, and audio content.
WHAT

VideoPlayer highlights, player profiles, event recaps, and short documentaries

WrittenNational news, player profiles, columns, long-form issue stories, and Player Tribune-type pieces

Audio Podcasts, interviews


WHO

High school athletes
College athletes
Domestic and overseas professional athletes
Asian American sports leagues and tournaments

 
Why I am asking for your help
This is a startup publication, but I don't want it to seem like one. My plan is to get this venture off and running from day one. Here are some of the upfront costs that I am dealing with:

EquipmentCamera, lenses, tripods, hard drives, and microphones 

WebsiteDomain, and hosting

TravelTransportation cost for commute throughout California and potentially elsewhere

Staff (future)Pay reporters, designers, and others for their work down the road


At this moment, this is a one-man project. However, I am seeking the help of volunteer reporters who are passionate about the cause. And hopefully, this can be a larger operation in the future so that the diaspora residing all around the country can be fully covered. 
 

How you can help
Obviously, the most tangible way of helping my vision is through donating to the cause -- any amount helps! But I understand that, even if this is a cause you are passionate about, you may not be in a place right now where you can pitch in monetarily. And that is completely fine!
Here are other ways to help:

Share this campaign on social media
Spread the word of the publication
Volunteer yourself or refer other Asian American reporters to help further coverage
View and share content
Pitch me story ideas

I am also seeking sponsorships from organizations that actively seek to promote the Asian American narrative. So if you would like to partner in that way or know of organizations that would potentially be interested, please contact me!
 
Where you can find AMAZN (after it's launched)
Website - AMAZNHQ.com.
Social media 

Youtube - AMAZN HQ Media (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAUwRxRpxYy0fv...)
Twitter - coming soon

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>From the author and the illustrator who brought you, Unicorn's Picnic, a new collaborative project emerges, Unicorns are Assholes.</p>
<p>The response from Unicorn's Picnic was so encouraging, April Hilland and Rebeca Dávila Ortiz decided to create a book about unicorns just for adults!</p>
<p>Unicorns are Assholes is an adult picture book for people who hate unicorns.  Just kidding.   Unlike most unicorn books you have read before, Unicorns are Assholes is as awkward and humorous  as you and your friends.   </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Your support of this book means a lot. This is my second collaboration with the talented Rebeca Dávila Ortiz, and this book really can only exist with your help. All funds from this campaign go to the book's artwork, printing, and shipping. </p>
<p>Your support means a few other important things, too:</p>
<p>1) It's easy to admire and fall into the ""unicorn trap"" of social media filters and edited upbeat posts about your day to day life.  This book, Unicorns are Assholes, takes the filter off of unicorns and shows the very real and awkward world of unicorns.</p>
<p>2) The very talented illustrator, Rebeca Dávila Ortiz is paid fairly for her time and effort. </p>
<p>3) I have a few other books in the works, and your support now may allow me to work on and release some other interesting projects. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>At this point, the risks and challenges are behind us. The story is written and the manuscript is finalized. The illustrations are completed and printing will be completed through a printer in Victoria, BC, Canada. This project is set and ready to go! We just need the final funds to give our book wings. It’s up to you to be part of this success story!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>It's okay if you can't contribute, there are other ways to help a gal out:</p>
<ul>
<li>Post this link to any and all social media sites and invite your friends to support this project.</li>
<li>Forward this campaign to anyone who may need a laugh at a unicorn's expense, they'll thank you ; )</li>

<h2>The story so far...</h2>
<h3><strong><i>The Show...</i></strong></h3>
<p><i>Experience the incredible true story of Ireland’s 1798 Rebellion through song, imagery and storytelling in the capable hands of historical entertainer and musician Paddy Cullivan. Inspired by the American and French Revolutions of the late-18th Century, the ’10 Dark Secrets of 1798’ is a historical drama of 'Hamilton' and ‘Game of Thrones’ proportions, bringing a staggering array of characters to life. Wolfe Tone, Lord Edward Fitzgerald and Napper Tandy - George Washington, The ‘Mad King’ George III and Napoleon Bonaparte. Huge battles, victories and losses from the epic Wexford Rebellion to the unbelievable ’Year of the French’…and most importantly, the timeless call of the United Irishmen (and women!) to unite ‘Protestant, Catholic and Dissenter’…</i></p>
<h3><strong>The Book</strong></h3>
<p>My name is Paddy Cullivan - I'm a historical entertainer and writer. I was born in Galway and have a NCAD degree in visual communication and art history. I've also been a professional musician, composer and satirical comedian for 20 years and I've brought all these elements together to create popular multimedia shows that make history thrilling for live audiences.</p>
<p>I've toured my 1798 show in theatres and venues since 2018 to thousands of people. One question I'm asked after every show is 'where is the book?' because people love the stories and secrets I've revealed and want something tangible to take away. I enjoy the live aspect of what I do but the audience are right - having enlightened them to this incredible episode in Irish (and world) history, I need to publish it in book form. </p>
<p>By supporting my work you will see me create a brand that presents history in a new and accessible way (as well as getting the finished work for yourself!). I want you to be as excited and challenged by the 1798 rebellion as my audiences have been. I also want to make something of long-lasting artistic value, so I'll put as much into the design as I do into the writing. And finally, I believe this story of one-time unity between all the peoples on the island is so important, it can have an effect on modern Ireland and help point the way to a hopeful future together.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I'm looking for €20,000 to produce this book. I need funds to further research, write, illustrate, print and publish it. I'll be publishing 5000 hard copies, about half of which I estimate will go to funders, the rest to be sold at shows to help the book self-fund into the future. I also need the funds to create the website, expenses, extras and perks around the book - and use it as a foundation for a documentary and/or TV series.</p>
<p>Perks include the beautifully finished book, unique pieces like a hand-drawn map of the French advance through Connacht or a faithfully-reproduced  United Irishman membership uniquely printed on parchment, with your name written and numbered by the author. Your name will appear in the book and some perks will even get you free tickets to live performances of the show and a special book launch show for funders. For premium funders, you get all of the above and a personal performance of the show for a group in your area at an agreed venue, in Ireland or internationally.</p>
<p>If I don't reach my entire goal I will have to reduce the amount of product / perks I produce - but I'm hoping to surpass it and give the book a real chance of reaching as wide an audience as possible, with your help.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The story of 1798 confounds all our preconceptions about Irish identity. The enlightenment brought together people of all classes and religious backgrounds in an effort to create a new kind of society. This message still resonates as 21st century Ireland approaches possible unity in a post-Brexit world. If we learn about this past where Protestant, Catholic and Dissenter (Presbyterian) came together, it gives us an inspiring signpost for the future - and that's a very exciting project for myself and funders to be involved in. With your help we get the story out there and start a true understanding of our shared history.</p>
<p>I have performed the show over 100 times and it now sells out in arts centres, theatres and at festivals from Belfast to Cork and including the Dublin Festival of History, Kilkenomics and the Dalkey Book Festival. This gives the book a ready-made audience and a proven track-record of success so your investment will be in something that makes a real impact.</p>
<p>Recent artistic endeavours like 'John Adams', 'Hamilton' and 'Game of Thrones' have shown that people really love history and a strong, complex narrative as long as it is accessible and includes them. From 20 years in the entertainment business I know how to bring an audience with me and my passion is to do so to as wide an audience as possible.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We are living in a time of unprecedented change - and for working creative people nothing will be the same again. My work as a gigging musician and touring these shows used to provide funds for projects - I would never have asked for help before. The converse of that was that I was working so much there was little time to complete work of this nature. That's all changed and with the Coronavirus lockdown I will have no public work for at least 6 months. </p>
<p>I know that many of you will be watching every cent too, so I understand how hard fundraising will be at this time. However, I want to produce something unique that will bring hope, enlightenment and education after this terrible time is over. And I believe if we help each other out we will get through this and have an incredible amount of great work created as a bonus. </p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">When Santa gets stuck in a chimney, a firefighter named Nathan helps to get him out. Santa is so thankful, he asks Nathan to help them for the rest of the night.  And it’s a good thing they did.</p>

<p>When we decided we were going to publish the book, we thought that we would like to help people with the sales of Santa and His Super Hero.  Since a fire fighter was so helpful to Santa that night, we thought that we would help the fire fighters. We decided that net proceeds of the sale of our book will be given to the <a href=""http://burnfund.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong><span style=""color: #800000;"">BC Professional Fire Fighters’ Burn Fund (BCPFFABF)</span></strong>.</a> </p>
<p>The Burn Fund not only helps the survivors of fires across British Columbia, they are also big on the education and prevention of fires and injuries due to fire.  Another thing the BC Burn Fund does is in the summer they run a camp for children who are burn survivors.</p>
<p>Their new project is the Burn Fund Center.  A brand new building at main Street and East 23rd Avenue in Vancouver will be an affordable place for caregivers to stay as their loved ones are being treated for their injuries at either Children’s Hospital of the Trauma and Plastics Unit at Vancouver General Hospital (VGH). There are a couple reasons we picked the BC Professional Fire Fighters Burn Fund.</p>
<ol>
<li>The story is about Santa getting stuck in a chimney and a fire fighter saves him.</li>
<li>Later in the book they come across a chimney fire and the fire fighter puts out the fire so that Santa can safely deliver his presents.</li>
<li>Getting burned in a fire is often a devastating and life changing experience.  The BC Professional Burn fund does great work with burn survivors of all ages.  Please check out their website at <span style=""color: #800000;""><a href=""http://burnfund.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color: #800000;"">burnfund.org</a></span> for more information about the BC Professional Fire Fighters Burn Fund.</li>
</ol>
<p>In order to be able to donate as much money as possible, we decided to do this crowd-funding. </p>

</div></div>","The Book - the story
""The malls were crowded with last minute shoppers.  A blanket of snow covered the ground as the echoes of children caroling were heard through the silence of the evening. Up at the North Pole, the reindeer were harnessed to Santa’s sleigh. The gifts were all loaded and Zippy, Santa’s head elf was waiting to help Santa with his deliveries.  It was a Christmas Eve like every other, so they thought.""
When Santa gets stuck in a chimney, a firefighter named Nathan helps to get him out. Santa is so thankful, he asks Nathan to help them for the rest of the night.  And it’s a good thing they did.
In Santa and His Super Hero, you will read about Santa’s misadventures that Christmas evening and how his Super Hero, a fire fighter named Nathan helped him out.  The Cause - not just a Book
When we decided we were going to publish the book, we thought that we would like to help people with the sales of Santa and His Super Hero.  Since a fire fighter was so helpful to Santa that night, we thought that we would help the fire fighters. We decided that net proceeds of the sale of our book will be given to the BC Professional Fire Fighters’ Burn Fund (BCPFFABF). 
The Burn Fund not only helps the survivors of fires across British Columbia, they are also big on the education and prevention of fires and injuries due to fire.  Another thing the BC Burn Fund does is in the summer they run a camp for children who are burn survivors.
Their new project is the Burn Fund Center.  A brand new building at main Street and East 23rd Avenue in Vancouver will be an affordable place for caregivers to stay as their loved ones are being treated for their injuries at either Children’s Hospital of the Trauma and Plastics Unit at Vancouver General Hospital (VGH). There are a couple reasons we picked the BC Professional Fire Fighters Burn Fund.

The story is about Santa getting stuck in a chimney and a fire fighter saves him.
Later in the book they come across a chimney fire and the fire fighter puts out the fire so that Santa can safely deliver his presents.
Getting burned in a fire is often a devastating and life changing experience.  The BC Professional Burn fund does great work with burn survivors of all ages.  Please check out their website at burnfund.org for more information about the BC Professional Fire Fighters Burn Fund.

In order to be able to donate as much money as possible, we decided to do this crowd-funding. 
 
 Before the Book - Background StoryEvery Christmas since Nathan was born, we would go to the CityTV Breakfast Television FoodBank Friday in Vancouver.  The first time we went, we were interviewed by host Dawn Chubai.  When Nathan was just 1 year old, I started a company called Anything on a Clock.  Since then, whenever we went to FoodBank Friday, we would donate part proceeds of our November sales to the Food Bank.On December 4th, 2009, we went to the FoodBank Friday broadcast as we always had.  But this time was different.  Shortly after we arrived, a firetruck rolled in. Generally, Nathan is a bit groggy when we go to these events.  They start at 6:00 am and because we like to be there near the beginning, and then hang out for a bit, we usually leave the house around 5:00 am.  But when the fire truck arrived, Nathan got really excited.  Off camera, before our interview, Dawn Chubai asked Nathan why he was so excited.  Nathan being 3 1/2 years old at the time pointed to the firetruck and said “Super Heroes”.During our interview, Dawn asked Nathan again about the firefighters and he told Dawn that they were Super Heroes.  After our spot, they cut to Riaz Meghji who did an interview about the upcoming Santa Clause Parade.  Then it was the firefighter’s turn.  While Riaz was doling his thing, host Greg Harper asked if Nathan would like to join him at the firetruck for his segment. ...and so it all beganThat was the first time that Nathan connected his Super Heroes (firefighters) to Santa.  That evening when I tucked him into bed, I asked him for ideas for his bedtime story. He asked me “What would happen if Santa got stuck in a chimney?  Do you think firefighters would help them?” As Christmas grew closer, he would give different suggestions about how Santa got stuck in a chimney and how a firefighter came to his rescue.  Each night he would begin by giving a different scenario.  After a few nights I saw a pattern in our story telling so when he fell asleep each night, I would go to my computer and write down the story that we just made up. By Christmas, we had a lot of different adventures that Santa and his Super Hero would go on. They would all begin the same way; Santa would get caught in a chimney and a firefighter, his Super Hero, would pluck him out of the chimney. Later that year, I found the stories on my computer and thought that I would put it into a story book for Nathan.  I wrote out the story similar to what we have today and the next year I would read it to Nathan as we got closer to Christmas instead of making up the stories. Jump forward to the winter of 2014.  Christmas was approaching once again and Nathan asked me “When are we going to make this a real book?” I have been talking about it for the last few years but nothing came of it.  So I told him it was time we get it into print. And that is how we came up with a story about how a firefighter helped Santa when he got stuck in a Chimney.

Not because we do not have enough theories around the same, nor because we have not tried to do it already. </p><p>Creative Leadership - for all AGES helps you grasp the few strands of knowledge, some of which can add to your strengths and some of them can add glitter and make you more charismatic. And may be in a shorter span of time. To help you help others sooner. </p><p>My intention is to create a movement that is stronger than those I have already been part of in my development and growth as a leader. </p><p>Key Take Away from the book: My sketches around associations of Heritage, Creativity, Strategy, Decisions, you and your enterprises.</p><p>At the core, a leader is continuously envisioning the future, creating the change that will enable that future to happen and at the pace it needs to happen, and still be there when it happens, to benefit from it. For some these benefits can be for themselves, and for others these benefits can be for the ones they envisioned the future for.</p><p>To begin with, I will use a few words to make sense or to tag a Leader and his actions that stand for leadership. </p><p>Making Decisions both intime as well as to derive the most value<br/>Being Adoptive or being at the center of the affairs to be on top of them<br/>Sustaining the position<br/>Continuously exploring newer options to reduce costs and efforts and make lives better</p><p>Dreaming or envisioning isn’t a core activity in my opinion. That’s something which happens automatically when someone realises what's unique about them in the entire set of ecosystems around them, works to nurture it and learns how to utilise it to create an advantage. That is identifying their potential and putting it to use.</p><p>Sounds very similar to what we already know. Yes. </p><p>Only when someone is working around their uniqueness, can they be at the top, center and all around at the same time and sustaining it day by day. I will help you with this book.</p><p>I will do this by connecting you with multiple dimensions of perception, how to envision and create these for yourselves and others. And at times trying to delve into Heritage and Humanity itself.</p><p>That’s the reason it is difficult to follow or replicate a leader. And I believe is will never be possible to follow someone and become a leader, even when working in the same systems and for the same outcome.</p><p>Driven by Imagination, Collaborative research, Sensemaking, Growth mindset, Profit motive and the most recently acquired understanding on the value of care, based on the interactions and engagement with strategic initiatives over the past couple of decades in large corporates and new ventures across multiple industry verticals and geographies, working most of the time addressing recurring and persistent issues, experimenting and negotiation over constraints and in the process engaged most of the time with stakeholders from those in the top management to those still on top of affairs even without any position or recognition of any sort, I did try to make sense of what a Leader is. Or What leadership is. And what it takes to be creative and practical at the same time.</p><p>To understand is to achieve.

To build systems that help others understand is to lead. Creative Leadership - for all AGES is my first book. Setting the stage for Creative Leadership to blossom in every soul.AM Creactos (Arun Murthy Battula) https://www.linkedin.com/in/arunbattula/Just as a showcase, I have published my first eBook. Available for purchase here. http://www.lulu.com/spotlight/creactosLeadership will not and cannot be taught in a formal manner. Not because we do not have enough theories around the same, nor because we have not tried to do it already. Creative Leadership - for all AGES helps you grasp the few strands of knowledge, some of which can add to your strengths and some of them can add glitter and make you more charismatic. And may be in a shorter span of time. To help you help others sooner. My intention is to create a movement that is stronger than those I have already been part of in my development and growth as a leader. Key Take Away from the book: My sketches around associations of Heritage, Creativity, Strategy, Decisions, you and your enterprises.At the core, a leader is continuously envisioning the future, creating the change that will enable that future to happen and at the pace it needs to happen, and still be there when it happens, to benefit from it. For some these benefits can be for themselves, and for others these benefits can be for the ones they envisioned the future for.To begin with, I will use a few words to make sense or to tag a Leader and his actions that stand for leadership. Making Decisions both intime as well as to derive the most valueBeing Adoptive or being at the center of the affairs to be on top of themSustaining the positionContinuously exploring newer options to reduce costs and efforts and make lives betterDreaming or envisioning isn’t a core activity in my opinion. That’s something which happens automatically when someone realises what's unique about them in the entire set of ecosystems around them, works to nurture it and learns how to utilise it to create an advantage. That is identifying their potential and putting it to use.Sounds very similar to what we already know. Yes. Only when someone is working around their uniqueness, can they be at the top, center and all around at the same time and sustaining it day by day. I will help you with this book.I will do this by connecting you with multiple dimensions of perception, how to envision and create these for yourselves and others. And at times trying to delve into Heritage and Humanity itself.That’s the reason it is difficult to follow or replicate a leader. And I believe is will never be possible to follow someone and become a leader, even when working in the same systems and for the same outcome.Driven by Imagination, Collaborative research, Sensemaking, Growth mindset, Profit motive and the most recently acquired understanding on the value of care, based on the interactions and engagement with strategic initiatives over the past couple of decades in large corporates and new ventures across multiple industry verticals and geographies, working most of the time addressing recurring and persistent issues, experimenting and negotiation over constraints and in the process engaged most of the time with stakeholders from those in the top management to those still on top of affairs even without any position or recognition of any sort, I did try to make sense of what a Leader is. Or What leadership is. And what it takes to be creative and practical at the same time.To understand is to achieve. To build systems that help others understand is to lead. Why Fund: My equation P = TA^2P = Possibility or Probability of success T = Your thinking and ideas that originate from your experiences built around your uniquenessA = Your speedy Action to implement and realise your ideasThis book helps me create the channel to create and nurture the environments that can enhance the understanding of all those this set of knowledge reaches around the notions ofCreativity, Leadership, Strategy, Decision Making, Planning, Critical thinking, Intention, Purpose, Action, Enaction, Reaction, Proaction and Growth.Your belief and support will help me negotiate time to finetune the set of frameworks, methodologies, narrations and access resources needed through travel and reflection in expert networks. This will also help me speed up the process of publication of the book and provide me with the much needed funds to further action on the 3 dimensions of futurescapes I have started sketching.The large Impact you will create with a small support:CREACTOS    www.creactos.com

<h3>What I Need &amp; What I Want to Give You</h3>
<p>If I were Sadie (my main character in LUNAV), I could fly to All The Places.</p>
<p>If I were Mir (the nonbinary pilot in LOST BOY, FOUND BOY), I could also fly to All The Places; but in a ship instead of with wings like Sadie's.</p>
<p>Alas.</p>
<p>While I may have places to crash with lovely readers and friends in certain cities, flights and food and the costs of exhibiting at book cons and festivals -- and those random travel expenses that you never expect but always come up -- need to get covered.</p>
<p>Most of the funds you contribute will go directly toward my travel expenses for my book tour; the only funds that won't go right into paying for flights and trains will go right back to you!</p>
<p>Yep. You read it right: while most of the money will go directly to supporting my ability to make as many quality stops on my book tour as possible, some of it will go toward thanking you for helping make it a reality.</p>
<p>Some of you -- just check out the perks on the sidebar!! -- will receive shout-outs on social media to express my gratitude. Some of you will receive inscribed copies of LUNAV and digital copies of LOST BOY, FOUND BOY. Others will get signed bookmarks and limited edition LUNAV and LOST BOY merch, and/or lesbian faerie sweatshirts (because... who doesn't want lesbian faerie sweatshirts)? While my endless gratitude that you'll all get is, of course, free of charge, production and shipping of your goodies aren't: so, some of the money will go right back to you, in that respect.</p>
<p>Even if I don't hit my final goal, every bit that I do raise will go toward expanding my book tour: and truly, no sweatshirt (no matter how awesome) can ever thank you enough for that.</p>

<h3>Why a Book Tour?</h3>
<p>Along my writing journey so far -- whether it's through creating an almost absurd amount of Supergirl fan fiction on tumblr or through the program I'm setting up with my publisher to get queer young adult books into the hands of LGBTQIA+ young adults who can't afford them -- I keep hearing so many stories about the importance of being represented in the fiction we consume.</p>
<p>I weep along with the rest of you when lesbian characters are pointlessly killed off on television, and I head to the gym to pump out my rage when yet another trans kid is reduced to a stereotype in the media. We deserve fiction where we thrive; where we struggle, too, yes, but where we know we will ultimately be... happy.</p>
<p>We deserve multi-dimensional queer characters -- including love interests -- and I strive to bring that to my readers every day. My writing is not perfect, and never will be; but I will always keep trying to improve. </p>
<p>Part of that journey is this inaugural book tour: meeting each other -- readers and writers alike -- can only make our community stronger. Book talks, readings, and workshops can only serve to strengthen the creative and cathartic communities that we need in this world. I am humbled to play even a small role in these communities; and it would be an honor to take this book tour as far and wide as I can.</p>
<p>My online readership is strong, and it is worldwide: bringing these communities together in person would be the opportunity of a lifetime, and these book releases are the perfect time to start.</p>
<p>I would absolutely love it if you'd join me -- us -- on this journey.</p>

<h3>More Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Are you one of those young folks I've been talking about? One of those delightful readers and writers who've suggested locations for my book tour but for whom even a dollar contribution is too much right now?</p>
<p>Or, heck, is rent just too much this month?</p>
<p>I totally feel you.</p>

<p>As part of this team, you can spread the word about the books themselves, and you can spread the word about this campaign.

<h3>If you read, write, publish, or sell books about Texas, Lone Star Literary Life is for you.</h3>
<p>WE COVER THE TEXAS LITERARY SCENE like no one else, week in and week out. Since 2015, we’ve given Texas authors, booksellers, libraries, publishers, and readers a trusted platform of their own. With shrinking coverage devoted to books in mainstream media — and most of that focused on the same handful of national bestsellers — where were Texas authors to get noticed, and where were Texas readers to discover the books they crave? We’ve stepped up to make sure the Lone Star State doesn’t lose touch with its rich literary heritage, and that Texas books get their due.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1515278882/kfdqkd8yjkibtlkrpf9h.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>NOW, WE REALIZE you don’t read <i>only</i> about Texas, <i>all</i> the time. But when you do, you want to know about emerging writers, fresh takes on Texas history and culture, great events, and the newest releases from your longtime favorites. And we know you want opportunities to experience the literary scene, whether your interests run to signings, slams, or seminars.</p>
<p>As we head into our fourth year, we need your help to take Lone Star Lit to the next level.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Here’s how far we’ve come . . . </h3>
<p>SINCE LAUNCHING THREE YEARS AGO with the backing of some terrific supporters, Lone Star Lit has:  </p>
<ul>
<li>reviewed hundreds of Texas-related books in all genres —more professional reviews than in any other media outlet — showcasing more than 50 different publishers, including national houses and the majority of Texas-based presses</li>
<li>listed an average of a hundred book-and-author schedules each week in the state’s only comprehensive calendar of book events</li>
<li>interviewed more than 150 Texas writers, from best-sellers to debut authors</li>
<li>hosted more than 100 authors on Lone Star Book Blog Tours</li>
<li>shone a spotlight on thousands of libraries, booksellers, and venues with notices, advertisements, stories, news briefs, and events listings</li>
<li>provided resource directories of bookstores, writing groups, and more</li>
<li>charged readers $0 for content. Nada. <i>Zilch.</i>

<h3>Lone Star Lit’s reach and impact</h3>
<p>AT THE OUTSET OF 2018, our base of friends and followers continues to grow. But because the influence of literature — and literary news — is much greater than audience numbers alone, you’ll find our reviews quoted widely and our news shared far beyond the state's borders.</p>
<p>But since you're wondering about audience anyhow: </p>
<p>30,000 monthly uniques on our website • 10,000 on Facebook • 3,700 on Twitter • 1,400 on LinkedIn • 475 on Instagram • 7,500 in our opt-in email database</p>
<p>We're honored to bring you reviews and news from such stellar contributors as <strong>Rod Davis, Carlton Stowers, Angelina LaRue, Si Dunn, </strong>and <strong>Chris Manno,</strong> plus, every week, <strong>Glenn Dromgoole’s</strong> TEXAS READS column and featured reviews by NBCC critic <strong>Michelle Newby </strong>(whose <strong>TexasBookLover blog</strong> was named one of the state's Top 50 in 2017).</p>

<h3>Where we’ll go from here, with your help</h3>
<p>WE'RE THRILLED TO INTRODUCE some new ventures this year.</p>
<ul>
<li>In May, <strong>our weekly Lone Star Listens interviews will hit the shelves in book form</strong>, a compilation that will provide a valuable learning tool for apprentice writers and a one-of-a-kind archive of contemporary Texas literary life. Featuring a compelling overview of Texas letters by novelist and teacher Clay Reynolds, <i>Lone Star Listens</i> will shed light on the processes, inspirations, and achievements of Texas writers, with uniquely personal insights. (It’s one of our top perks for this campaign, too!)</li>
<li>In 2018 we also look to go live with <strong>Texas Book Talk,</strong> taking our content into the audiosphere for those of you who enjoy listening via podcast and Internet radio.</li>
<li>Finally, we’ll update our annual <strong>Top Texas Bookish Destinations</strong> this spring in book form as well as online. Look for <i>Literary Texas</i> in a bookstore near you, or support this campaign and be one of the first to have a copy mailed to your door.</li>

“This is what ought to have been there all along.” — STEPHEN HARRIGAN

 
Lone Star Lit’s reach and impact
AT THE OUTSET OF 2018, our base of friends and followers continues to grow. But because the influence of literature — and literary news — is much greater than audience numbers alone, you’ll find our reviews quoted widely and our news shared far beyond the state's borders.
But since you're wondering about audience anyhow: 
30,000 monthly uniques on our website • 10,000 on Facebook • 3,700 on Twitter • 1,400 on LinkedIn • 475 on Instagram • 7,500 in our opt-in email database
We're honored to bring you reviews and news from such stellar contributors as Rod Davis, Carlton Stowers, Angelina LaRue, Si Dunn, and Chris Manno, plus, every week, Glenn Dromgoole’s TEXAS READS column and featured reviews by NBCC critic Michelle Newby (whose TexasBookLover blog was named one of the state's Top 50 in 2017).
“We were really pleased . . .[Texas readers] were a community that hadn’t really been drawn together. — ELIZABETH CROOK


 
Where we’ll go from here, with your help
WE'RE THRILLED TO INTRODUCE some new ventures this year.

In May, our weekly Lone Star Listens interviews will hit the shelves in book form, a compilation that will provide a valuable learning tool for apprentice writers and a one-of-a-kind archive of contemporary Texas literary life. Featuring a compelling overview of Texas letters by novelist and teacher Clay Reynolds, Lone Star Listens will shed light on the processes, inspirations, and achievements of Texas writers, with uniquely personal insights. (It’s one of our top perks for this campaign, too!)
In 2018 we also look to go live with Texas Book Talk, taking our content into the audiosphere for those of you who enjoy listening via podcast and Internet radio.
Finally, we’ll update our annual Top Texas Bookish Destinations this spring in book form as well as online. Look for Literary Texas in a bookstore near you, or support this campaign and be one of the first to have a copy mailed to your door.


“Thank you; keep on doing that good work!”— DAVE PARSONS, Texas Poet Laureate 2011

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p>So you know how one day you’re a sprightly young twenty something, ambling your way through life visiting exotic holiday destinations and spending all your not very hard earned cash on partying with not a care in the world? You think you’re going to stay that way for ever right? Only one day you find yourself living in the suburbs with two kids and a mortgage, and you realise that forty is really right around the corner. Do you accept your fate, let your belt out a notch or two, strap yourself into your economical family car and enjoy the rather sedentary ride through middle age? Or maybe you stop in your tracks, take stock of your settled ways, and try to find a way to put the fun back in.</p><p>As I hurtled towards the big four-0, I met a lady in her seventies who consciously chose to live an abundant life, filled with family, friends and activities she relished. Her energy put me to shame, and encouraged me to reflect on the contented, yet settled nature of the current stage of my life. I needed to put a little fun back in. I decided to have a go at abundant living myself. In the year I turned forty, I would do forty things for the first time.   </p><p>The challenge would see me appear on a BBC game show, audition for Britain's got Talent and dye my sensible hair bright pink. I told each story along the way, explaining why I had chosen each ‘first’, recalling some memories stirred up as I prepared for and completed each one. I wrote honestly and humorously about my endeavours, my triumphs and my spectacular failures. </p><p>Some highlights of the challenges include </p><p>• Picking up my violin after twenty years, and busking on the Royal Mile, Edinburgh. My son saw that I was struggling so came to join me with his ukelele. It didn’t help - we got moved on after twenty minutes. </p><p>• Driving a tank in Stirlingshire. I saw it as my personal mission to rattle the nerves of my teenage driving instructor. </p><p>• Setting off thousands of pounds worth of fireworks at a stately home for a celebrity wedding. </p><p>• Killing and eating a lobster named Jemima. </p><p>What results is my first book '40 is my Forte', a genuine and amusing portrayal of a middle aged woman attempting to reclaim the more exciting feel of her youth, and balancing that with the restrictions that family life entails. </p><p>I'm now hoping to get my book published. The money raised here will go towards paying an editor to check over my suspect grammar and spelling, a graphic designer to come up with an eye catching cover and of course the printer to actually, you know, print the books.</p><p>My manuscript is complete.

You think you’re going to stay that way for ever right? Only one day you find yourself living in the suburbs with two kids and a mortgage, and you realise that forty is really right around the corner. Do you accept your fate, let your belt out a notch or two, strap yourself into your economical family car and enjoy the rather sedentary ride through middle age? Or maybe you stop in your tracks, take stock of your settled ways, and try to find a way to put the fun back in.As I hurtled towards the big four-0, I met a lady in her seventies who consciously chose to live an abundant life, filled with family, friends and activities she relished. Her energy put me to shame, and encouraged me to reflect on the contented, yet settled nature of the current stage of my life. I needed to put a little fun back in. I decided to have a go at abundant living myself. In the year I turned forty, I would do forty things for the first time.   The challenge would see me appear on a BBC game show, audition for Britain's got Talent and dye my sensible hair bright pink. I told each story along the way, explaining why I had chosen each ‘first’, recalling some memories stirred up as I prepared for and completed each one. I wrote honestly and humorously about my endeavours, my triumphs and my spectacular failures. Some highlights of the challenges include • Picking up my violin after twenty years, and busking on the Royal Mile, Edinburgh. My son saw that I was struggling so came to join me with his ukelele. It didn’t help - we got moved on after twenty minutes. • Driving a tank in Stirlingshire. I saw it as my personal mission to rattle the nerves of my teenage driving instructor. • Setting off thousands of pounds worth of fireworks at a stately home for a celebrity wedding. • Killing and eating a lobster named Jemima. What results is my first book '40 is my Forte', a genuine and amusing portrayal of a middle aged woman attempting to reclaim the more exciting feel of her youth, and balancing that with the restrictions that family life entails. I'm now hoping to get my book published. The money raised here will go towards paying an editor to check over my suspect grammar and spelling, a graphic designer to come up with an eye catching cover and of course the printer to actually, you know, print the books.My manuscript is complete. I have an editor on board, graphic designer lined up and a book press ready to hit 'print'. I've never done this before, but I have a good team around me, experienced in the world of publishing, and self publishing, and I'm confident they will steer me in the right direction.The timescale is a bit of a best guess at this stage. I will endeavour to publish my book at the earliest opportunity once funding has been secured, but I would imagine there are a number of variables, so there is a bit of educated guesswork here.My PR machine (AKA Facebook & Twitter) is ready and waiting to go and I am already embracing the art of self promotion.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Miodrag Ilic, and I am owner and Chef Editorial of well know culinary web portal in Serbia: Recepti i Kuvar online.</p>
<p>We want to create a bilingual cookbook containing traditional recipes of national Serbian cuisine including our cultural, health and historical aspects, so as to save the recipes of our grandmothers and great-grandmothers from oblivion.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The money we will get as support for this project, will be used for preparing, design, translation and print of this book. The number of our associates who are unselfishly engaged in preparing this book is large: they share their ideas with us, their photos, recipes from their families' old cookbooks...</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>When someone says “sarma” , “vanilice”, “baklava”, “pogača”, “zeljanica”, “pihtije”... in Serbia, it immediately refreshes one's memories and the relation with tradition. The tradition of Serbian cuisine is very old. One of the oldest Serbian cookbook was Srbski kuvar by Krusedol Monastery monk Jerotej Draganovic, published in 1865, in the Old Slavic language. One of the most educated people living at the end of 19<sup>th</sup> and the beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, Sima Trojanovic (who was ethnologist),  published a book called Old Serbian Dishes and Beverages in 1896.</p>
<p>The list of such old collections of recipes, cookbooks, books on customs is very long. These books represent our primary motivation and driving force to start and finish this project underlain by the following idea: to preserve a part of the culinary and cultural heritage that came from our ancestors. In this book, you will find many old dishes which are now on the verge of being forgotten, which can be very rarely ordered in restaurants and are seldom prepared even within the family circles.</p>
<p>This project is recognized and supported by Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Serbia, as very important step in order to preserve a part of the culinary and cultural heritage:</p>
<p><i>„A traditional recipe of the local Serbian cuisine is an important part of the intangible cultural heritage of each nation. The list of elements of the intangible cultural heritage of the Republic of Serbia, in addition to traditional crafts, folk tradition, ethno songs and dances, with naive painting Slovaks, there are Belmuz meal, traditional production of Pirot cheese, pazarske mantije meal (traditional method of preparation). These elements are vital to the preservation of national identity, and are also an integral part of various tourism offers.</i></p>

<h3>Why is Serbian cuisine so specific?</h3>
<p>Because it represents a unique collection of cultural and culinary, national and historical diversity that emerged in the past centuries... The mixture of Turkish, Greek, Bulgarian, Hungarian and other cuisines makes it rich and distinctive.</p>

<h3><strong>Nice of you to stop by...</strong></h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1496099355/tved7vhns3uryuyp32xg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm Ant and against my better judgment, I am a writer. An independent one, for my sins. In other words, I am not tied to any big Publishing House nor do I have to stick to tight, nerve-wrecking deadlines to please my agent and publishers. It works for me, because that means I am pretty much the captain of my art.</p>
<p>However, being an Indie Author means I need to be more experimental, creative, daring and resourceful to get my work out to the wider audience.</p>
<p>It also means my writing does not pay my bills, which is not all that cool. For that reason I rely on a monotonous 9-to-5 to keep creditors at safe arm's length. Don't get me wrong, I am grateful for that, but it's not what I really am. Because of my creative and somewhat chaotic nature, I enjoy the freedom of working without timetable, schedules, shift, even if that means working into the silly hours of night. In addition, the idea of having a mobile office such as cafes, pubs, on a plane, on the beach, hotel, even in bed, can be liberating, although they do leave annoying reminders on my waistline. </p>
<p>In the meantime, I have to resort to writing when all are asleep at home or at the office when my boss is not around, but please don’t tell him that. At least not until I become a rich author.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1496002833/bscqxzal0nwfdoh3ohzu.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>Damned if I don't</h3>
<p>Now, DAMNED IF I DON'T, is the brainchild of that kind of work. Seven tales partly inspired by my travels, mishaps, mashups, and  a sometimes overindulgent imagination. But, although all the tales are work of fiction, there is an element of what life is about, and what happens when we think things too much, procrastinate, or simply feel too afraid to make a decisions - whether it's the right one or not.</p>
<p>I started writing them while working on my first novel, IN YOUR DREAMS. What started as an exercise to clear my writer’s block at the time morphed into some interesting, weird and why not, entertaining and outlandish stories, which I believe you will enjoy and hopefully share afterwards.</p>
<p>DAMNED IF I DON'T is all about life and it's absurdities. But hey, go ahead and take a brief peek at the stories by clicking <a href=""https://www.antrichards.com/damned-if-i-don-t"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>. Or <a href=""https://www.antrichards.com/damned-if-i-don-t"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve even created a playlist for every story with songs that I feel fit in with each tale's atmosphere. Er, yes, check them out <a href=""https://www.antrichards.com/short-stories-playlist"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</p>
<p>The truth is, there is no perfect time for chasing your dreams, taking that risk, kissing those lips, saying that ‘I love you’, or simply living your life. Carpe Diem. You either do it and face the consequences, good or bad, or you simply let it pass. Regrets, if any, can wait for later.  </p>
<p>And this is exactly what I am doing now. Carpe bloody-dieming the moment.</p>
<p>I am by nature a storyteller, and as such, I sprinkle my writing with elements of what I love and what surround me, so regardless of the genre, don't be surprised if you find references to music, travel and humor in my stories.</p>
<p>I therefore invite you to join in this carpe dieming quest and help get this book published. Not only will you help me get closer to that dream of filling the world with wonderful and absurd stories, but just as importantly, we'll also encourage other Indie Authors and more independent artists to take the risk, chase their dream and show their talent to the big, hungry audience out there.</p>
<p>What's more, this may even inspire you as well!</p>
<p>As someone very dear to me always says, 'you have the NO guaranteed, anything beyond that is a bonus'.</p>

<ul>
<li>DAMNED IF I DON’T needs a professional content edit to make sure the flow, structure, every minute detail makes sense and is all in place.

<li>Fortunately, the cover is being lovingly designed by a very talented friend and he is happy to accept payment in liquid form. Even at the expense of his liver. I'm happy to oblige.</li>
<li>Once all the above is complete, I need to format and upload the final manuscript for it to be beautifully presented for paperback printing. In addition, there is the electronic (kindle) upload for those who prefer the techie way of reading.</li>
<li>There will also be a small element of merchandising and promotion to reach that wider audience. I do need to bribe you somehow.</li>
<li>Finally, we have the shipping costs for the paperback that will be sent to all you lovely people.</li>
</ul>
<p>For all this I have come up with a budget of £2,000.00 to cover the above costs.</p>
<p>In return for your support, there will be some goodies thrown in. You will receive, once the book is published, a PDF version of the book; a [personally] signed paperback copy; a mention on my website, you may even be immortalized in the book's acknowledgment (yep, your name will be there!) and if you really go that extra penny (or cent) a mention in the dedication as well! Check out the ‘Perks’ column for exact details of what your contribution will get you.</p>
<p>But it's not just about me and my book, you know. Life has blessed me in many ways, but has also thrown in some pretty shitty challenges too. Cancer, stroke, dementia has touched my closest and dearest. Some have lost the battle, others still stubbornly refuse to give in. For that reason, I also plan to donate 10% of all your contributions to three charities I feel very strongly about; Macmillan's Cancer research, UK Stroke Association &amp; Alzheimer’s Society. So, the more you give, the more that will also go into helping these awesome charities.</p>
<p>I appreciate this will be a bumpy ride and I am trying my damnedest (no pun intended) to see this project through, but I'm sure that with your support, some sweet-talking from my end (I was told threatening friends and family is still illegal in many countries), a bit of luck and lots of imagination, DAMNED IF YOU DON'T will be on many folks' kindles and bookshelves soon!</p>

Hi,
I'm Ant and against my better judgment, I am a writer. An independent one, for my sins. In other words, I am not tied to any big Publishing House nor do I have to stick to tight, nerve-wrecking deadlines to please my agent and publishers. It works for me, because that means I am pretty much the captain of my art.
However, being an Indie Author means I need to be more experimental, creative, daring and resourceful to get my work out to the wider audience.
It also means my writing does not pay my bills, which is not all that cool. For that reason I rely on a monotonous 9-to-5 to keep creditors at safe arm's length. Don't get me wrong, I am grateful for that, but it's not what I really am. Because of my creative and somewhat chaotic nature, I enjoy the freedom of working without timetable, schedules, shift, even if that means working into the silly hours of night. In addition, the idea of having a mobile office such as cafes, pubs, on a plane, on the beach, hotel, even in bed, can be liberating, although they do leave annoying reminders on my waistline. 
In the meantime, I have to resort to writing when all are asleep at home or at the office when my boss is not around, but please don’t tell him that. At least not until I become a rich author.

Damned if I don't
Now, DAMNED IF I DON'T, is the brainchild of that kind of work. Seven tales partly inspired by my travels, mishaps, mashups, and  a sometimes overindulgent imagination. But, although all the tales are work of fiction, there is an element of what life is about, and what happens when we think things too much, procrastinate, or simply feel too afraid to make a decisions - whether it's the right one or not.
I started writing them while working on my first novel, IN YOUR DREAMS. What started as an exercise to clear my writer’s block at the time morphed into some interesting, weird and why not, entertaining and outlandish stories, which I believe you will enjoy and hopefully share afterwards.
DAMNED IF I DON'T is all about life and it's absurdities. But hey, go ahead and take a brief peek at the stories by clicking here. Or here.
I’ve even created a playlist for every story with songs that I feel fit in with each tale's atmosphere. Er, yes, check them out here.
The truth is, there is no perfect time for chasing your dreams, taking that risk, kissing those lips, saying that ‘I love you’, or simply living your life. Carpe Diem. You either do it and face the consequences, good or bad, or you simply let it pass. Regrets, if any, can wait for later.  
And this is exactly what I am doing now. Carpe bloody-dieming the moment.
I am by nature a storyteller, and as such, I sprinkle my writing with elements of what I love and what surround me, so regardless of the genre, don't be surprised if you find references to music, travel and humor in my stories.
I therefore invite you to join in this carpe dieming quest and help get this book published. Not only will you help me get closer to that dream of filling the world with wonderful and absurd stories, but just as importantly, we'll also encourage other Indie Authors and more independent artists to take the risk, chase their dream and show their talent to the big, hungry audience out there.
What's more, this may even inspire you as well!
As someone very dear to me always says, 'you have the NO guaranteed, anything beyond that is a bonus'.

What we get back, is equal to what we give out.

It's the little things in life that makes the difference.  And here, my dear folks, is the reason for this campaign:

DAMNED IF I DON’T needs a professional content edit to make sure the flow, structure, every minute detail makes sense and is all in place.

There will also be a small element of merchandising and promotion to reach that wider audience. I do need to bribe you somehow.
Finally, we have the shipping costs for the paperback that will be sent to all you lovely people.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>After running the I Heart British TV website and community for 2 years now, we've noticed a couple problems common to British TV fans:</p>
<ul>
<li>With so many British TV programs, it can be hard to keep track of which ones you've watched.</li>
<li>Once you've watched a lot of British TV, it can be hard to discover shows you haven't seen.</li>
</ul>
<p>The British TV Guide contains well over 1000 British TV shows from the last 50 years. Shows are divided by category, and we provide air dates, descriptions, and a checklist of seasons and specials so you can mark off what you've seen.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534033688/g4cpgxtr62ryujmvcejn.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Next time your favorite British TV service announces they're airing Series 6 of a show you like, you won't have to guess whether you've seen it - you can just check your field guide.</p>
<p><u><strong>We'll also be creating a section on our website where you can look up the shows from the guide and see where you can watch them.</strong></u> As much as we'd love to include that information in the book, we don't want to print a guide that'll be outdated in a week. There will be plenty of journal space in the 8"" x 10"" guide so you can take notes.</p>

<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>To make it both attractive and easy on the eyes, we're producing these 8"" x 10"" guides with larger-than-average text and color printing - along with plenty of journal space for jotting down notes, questions, or upcoming air dates on your favorite streaming service.</p>
<ul>
<li>We're offering our Indiegogo supporters a 25% discount off the eventual retail price of $20</li>
<li>While we will be ordering extras, the Indiegogo campaign is the only way to guarantee you'll get a copy when they come out </li>
<li>If we don't reach the full $5000 goal, we'll still go to print - but we'll print fewer copies. If you really want a copy, don't hesitate - pick your favorite option and pledge your support!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Since we started IHeartBritishTV.com, we've heard so many great stories about how British TV has affected people's lives. We've had readers who watch on tablets during dialysis and caregivers who cherish the hours spent watching British TV with elderly loved ones. For others, including  myself, it's a shared interest between different generations of family members. </p>
<p>Beyond that, a great many people have written in to say they feel better about themselves when they see all the ""normal"" people in British TV. British television doesn't push the older, or less conventionally attractive people to the sidelines. It's refreshing and quirky.</p>
<p>In short, British TV is a big deal to a lot of people - and we want to make it easier for people to discover and enjoy a wide variety of British shows. We've been doing it for 2 years with our website and Facebook group, and now's the time to take it to the next level.  We hope you'll choose to be a part of it.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Hundreds of man hours have already been invested, so the British TV Field Guide is nearly complete. That means there's very, very little risk of not delivering on time in November. However, in the interest of being overly cautious, there's always the remote chance of minor delays with the printer.  We've arranged for a backup publisher in the event of price changes or problems with our first choice, just in case.</p>
<p>Mugs, towels, and tote bags will ship separately from your guide, and they'll likely arrive well  before it does. This campaign ends in mid-September, at which time the non-guide items will be produced and shipped. Those items should arrive before the end of October at the latest.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't afford to contribute, no worries - there will be chances to win a copy after the guide goes live on our website. In the meantime, we really appreciate your help in spreading the word to more British TV fans. Check out the share buttons at the top of this page - we love the extra attention :)</p>
<p>To everyone who's read this far, thank you - and happy watching! </p>

<p>I'm a New Jersey native that grew up on action and adventure stories (books &amp; movies) and have always had an overactive imagination.  I've worked in film, television, radio, and theater for more than 20 years.</p>
<p>I've recently completed my debut spy novel titled, ""Destiny Can Be Dangerous,"" an action packed espionage story about a fictional Domestic Protection Group that works within the U.S. to fight terror plots within our borders.  Primarily set throughout the Northeast United States with an exciting climax that takes our female secret agent and her team across the country in an attempt to stop a devastating plot against our government.</p>
<p>I'll periodically share excerpts from The Novel as I reach milestones in my fundraising, but here's a brief taste:<br/><br/><i>""[She] had still been watching the flip book of memories and emotions when she reached the bottom of the hill. Agent Billman had tossed his things in the back seat and said hello to a cold reception. He was nervous he had already started things off on the wrong foot by being late, but when he entered the vehicle he realized she was either spaced out or deep in concentration. </i></p>
<p><i>[She] looked at him and recognized his eyes and nose the most. The last time she had seen him, Agent Billman was at a prep meeting for a deep cover operation in New York. His hair was in a short crew cut now, but the beard she remembered was starting to grow in. Agent Robbins put the car in drive and accelerated away from the last of any relaxation or break time she'd allow herself until Agent Mitchell Howard was safely recovered from the enemy that she still knew so little about.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This is probably as simple as it can get.  I'm pre-selling my book to provide you with a guaranteed perk while enabling me to print more copies for future sales and promotions.</p>
<p>I'm targeting a goal of $2,250.00 for this campaign</p>
<ul>
<li>Every $15 ""Pre-Order"" Contribution adds to my marketing and advertising efforts and I can print 2 copies of The Novel and ship yours at no cost to you! (free shipping within the U.S.)  You get your copy (with a personal thank you note of course), and I get one to sell at full-cover-price or distribute in future promotions.<ul><li>The beauty of this concept is that no matter what percentage of my goal I reach (10% or 1,000%), YOU will be making it possible for me to print copies of my novel so that I have a better chance of getting them in the hands of readers.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Obviously the primary perk is the $15 contribution for ""Pre-Ordering"" the book, but if you're feeling more generous and want to be more involved there are a few options available to you.  Check out the full list of perks. Click any perk to find out more about what you get!</li>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

Every $15 ""Pre-Order"" Contribution adds to my marketing and advertising efforts and I can print 2 copies of The Novel and ship yours at no cost to you! (free shipping within the U.S.)  You get your copy (with a personal thank you note of course), and I get one to sell at full-cover-price or distribute in future promotions.The beauty of this concept is that no matter what percentage of my goal I reach (10% or 1,000%), YOU will be making it possible for me to print copies of my novel so that I have a better chance of getting them in the hands of readers.

Obviously the primary perk is the $15 contribution for ""Pre-Ordering"" the book, but if you're feeling more generous and want to be more involved there are a few options available to you.  Check out the full list of perks. Click any perk to find out more about what you get!

 
Other Ways You Can Help
If you cannot contribute financially or do not want to pre-order a book at this time, you CAN  HELP simply by sharing this campaign across your social media networks and with friends and relatives.  That is just as much appreciated and equally helpful for my publishing escapades!

<h3>Who I am and the book history</h3>
<p>I am Eliane Gordeeff or just Gordeeff.</p>
<p>I have 18 years of experience in animation, 20 years as a professor (in Brazil) and 7 years as a researcher. Now finishing my Ph.D. in Multimedia at Fine Arts Faculty of Lisbon University (sponsored by a CNPq/Brazil scholarship).</p>
<p>I have participated in plus than 16 academic events and have written more than 25 articles about animation. More and more, I fall in love with animation and all its manifestations.</p>
<p>This book project (little preview, click <strong><a href=""https://issuu.com/a.interferences/docs/book-2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">HERE</a></strong>)is based on my master’s degree in visual arts (2011), at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (Brazil), as I pointed out in the video. In the text, I discuss how Stop-motion visual can help the storytelling, analyzing 5 shorts:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><i>Neighbours </i>(Norman McLaren, 1952);</p></li>
<li><p>From Window to Cinema (Quiá Rodrigues, 1999);</p></li>
<li><p><i>The Old Man and the Sea</i> (Alexander Petrov, 2000);</p></li>
<li><p><i>Adagio</i> (Garry Bardin, 2000);</p></li>
<li><p><i>Aria</i> (Piotr Sapegin, 2001).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>And since then, I’m trying to publish the text, through some Publishing Companies, but without success.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Why this subject?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">In this text, I analyzed the aesthetic of the technic, because I was very moved when I watched “Aria”, in 2000. And even in 2009, I still wanted to know why it moved me so deeply. That has been the reason I went for the Master degree research.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Well, all of this means that who can help me with this Project, will be helping to make true a 7 years old dream! As well she/he will help others to understand why a moving puppet moves us all.</p>

<h3>About the Book Project</h3>
<p>Of course, I launched this campaign to raise funds to support the first edition of the book. Which are divided as you can see below (for now, the values can vary up or down a little bit, it is a dynamic process):</p>
<ul>
<li>Costs to print 500 copies with color images, A5 format, paper cover, and E-book (with fees) (+/-) ==============================================&gt; 4,500.00 €<br/>Costs of images licensing (+/-) ===============================&gt;     500.00 €<br/>Costs of linguistic revision (+/-) ==============================&gt;   1,500.00 €<br/>*Production of: the campaign, the book, the graphic design, the book cover<br/>  (the photo is from the making of a co-directed animation of mine, 2009),<br/>  the translation and publishing  ===============================&gt;         0.00 €<br/>Costs of IndieGoGo platform + Costs of credit card fees (+/-)==========&gt;   707.40 €<br/>Bank fees and taxes (+/-) ===================================&gt;     314.82 €<br/>Taxes on the value of mail submissions of Perks (+/-) ===============&gt;     196.80 €<br/>                                                                                                                  <strong>  TOTAL(+/-) -----  7,719.02 €</strong>
</li>
<li>As my background is in Graphic Design, I personally take care of the graphics production. All that in order to reach a lower cost.</li>
<li>You can already take a look in a little preview of the book. Just click <strong><a href=""https://issuu.com/a.interferences/docs/book-2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">HERE</a></strong>:</li>
<li>I offer perks in a total value higher than 7.700 € because I try to offer more choice possibilities to backers, and that way reach my goal.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Supporters of the book</strong>:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Some institutions are supporting this idea, which also reduced costs, as they didn’t charge for the licensing of images from their films. They are, for now:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:80px;""><strong><i>CTAv</i> </strong>(Brazil, producer of the animation ""From Window to Cinema"");<br/><strong><i>Tonic </i></strong>(former Pascal Blais, producer of the animation ""The Old Man and the Sea"");<br/><i><strong>Pravda</strong> </i>(Norway, producer of the animation ""Aria"");<br/><i><strong>Stayer</strong> </i>(Russia, producer of the animation ""Adagio"").</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">But the book also has the<u> institutional support</u> of:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:80px;""><i><strong>Cinanima Festival</strong> </i>(Portugal, where the book will be released later this year);<br/><strong><i>Monstra Festival</i> </strong>(Portugal);<br/><strong><i>ZippyFrames.com</i> </strong>- institutional and outreach support.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">They believe in the work, and they think it's worth it.<br/>I hope everyone who reads this text believes it too.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>About this Campaign</h3>
<p><u>I have very little time</u>.<br/>The <i>Cinanima</i> begins on November 12th, and the book can only begin to be printed after the end of the campaign - October 2nd - that is, the campaign has less than 50 days to run.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>And if</strong><strong> so I do not get all the money?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">That is, who really wants and can help me, must also be fast, okay? :)</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The campaign is flexible, that is, I pay a little more to IndieGoGo, but I get the amount raised, even if it does not reach my full goal.<br/>And why do I risk that? Because I think it's important and it's too much work, for risking doing nothing in the end. I will do it anyway, according to the help you could give!</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">If I cannot print 500 books, I can print fewer ... with the images in B &amp; W, anyway ... I'll find it a way!<br/>In Brazil, we have a saying ""I'm Brazilian, and I never give up"" ... and who knows me, knows what I'm talking about! :)</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>And if</strong><strong> so I do get more money?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">It would be very nice, of course!<br/>And in this case, I could print more books and with a hardcover, and so ...</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""> </p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>Regarding Perks!</strong></h3>
<p>All kind of perks can be seen on the right side, and vary with the amount of the contribution, as usual. The highest contribution values are focused on educational institutions.<br/>I already inform that books will be sent, logically, after its publishing process, after I receive them and its launch in Cinanima Festival. That is, after the 20th of November.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>And why this delay?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">I'm going to be in <i>Cinanima</i> for the book’s release and doing the news coverage of the Festival for the <i>Zippy Frames</i> site, from 12th to 18th November. Only after the Festival is over I will be able to take care of packing and sending the books. However...</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">It is also worth noting that I do not receive money from IndieGoGo as soon as the contributor makes the contribution, but only <u>15 useful days</u> after the campaign is finished! And it still depends on the time of the bank transaction, between the US and Portugal, for the money to reach my account! (I'll need to do a disbursement after 20days campaign, just to pay the half cost of publishing.)</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Just after that, I can send all Perks, okay?<br/>I hope you understand me and do not be upset with me, please ... I would also like to receive the money faster! ... Even because I will have bills to pay!</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">I will keep everyone informed!</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>And the E-book?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The publisher will be responsible for sending the e-books, They carry the editing control of the e-books, which ones, will be sent by email - therefore, <u>double-check if you typed the right email address</u> !!!</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">And that can only be done after the campaign closes, and according to the publisher, okay?</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Positive points of the project</h3>
<ul>
<li>It is very difficult to find a book that looks at the aesthetic and the narrative of stop-motion animation. This book comes to diminish this issue a little.</li>
<li>Just as it is rare an animated book written by a South American. It’s even more, to be written by a South American woman !!!</li>
<li>So, despite being suspicious ?, I think it's worth investing in something different. Since each writer carries the look of their culture, I certainly carry a Brazilian look, tinted by Russian (my father was Russian), as well as a feminine eye about animation.</li>
</ul>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>And to Finish</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you can help with a contribution, please do it. And I ask you to help to make some noise about my campaign, too - you can use the Indiegogo share tools!</li>
<li>I'm doing everything, I have just a help of my life partner. So, sometimes is difficult to do everything fast as I would like. So, I thank you for your patience. :)</li>

<h3>Who Am I and Who's the Community?</h3>
<p>My name is Erin Casey, and I'm an urban fantasy and YA fantasy writer, as well as a mom to seven birds (several who are rescues).</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535171197/zx0fhscztcgfbtfm0o2p.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Why is this a big deal? Well, my main character, Bianca, is a werebird! Can you guess where I got the inspiration? </p>
<p>For daily work, I'm a proofreader at Pearson. Volunteer wise, I'm the Communications and Student Relationships Manager at the <a href=""http://www.iowawritershouse.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Iowa Writers' House</a>, a literary organization focused on providing workshops to the community and helping writers with their craft, career, and community.</p>
<p>I'm also the Director of <a href=""https://www.thewritersrooms.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Writers' Rooms</a>, a non-profit corporation focused on providing a free and safe environment to all writers no matter their gender, skill set, background, income, etc. I love both organizations because it gives me the chance to work with the literary community and help people with their writing. </p>
<p>""The Purple Door District"" started out as part of a canon that AE Kellar and I are writing together and hoping to publish in the future. PDD was a smaller component of it, but I fell in love with the concept and asked if I could write a series based on it to help support our main canon. She has been vital in helping me make sure I keep my facts straight! We jokingly say that she's the brain and I'm the heart of our series. I couldn't have done this without her. </p>
<p>Now I'm looking back to the community for help. My dream is to become an author and help inspire other people. Community plays a big part in my life now, because it was something I grew up without as a child. ""The Purple Door District"" is all about people of different backgrounds, abilities, and beliefs coming together to save a young woman from being hunted. I'm going to self-publish this book, but I need help. The funds are much greater than I expected, and at the same time, I want to support artists, marketers, and editors who believe in this story and want to help bring it to life. </p>

<li>A one-on-one writing talk with me</li>
<li>and much more! </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I can't even express how important your support is. Self-publishing is becoming a  more respected form of publishing, and I can't do it without your help. In a time when our country feels so divided, I think it's valuable to bring a book with a diverse cast to the community. The main character is Latina. She works with parahumans who are Latino, Native American, black, Caucasian, LGBT, etc, and with those who have different beliefs to survive. Even if the different parahumans have prejudices against one another, they're able to put it aside to make their community safer for themselves and for their children. I hope that people who read this will see themselves in these characters. As I get deeper in to the series, I want to bring in more people of different nationalities, beliefs, and abilities so they can feel represented as well. </p>
<p>You have the opportunity to see a group of creative minds come together to create this book and its future series. We can do this together, and in December, I hope you'll feel proud holding this book in your hands.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I completely understand that you may not be able to donate, and that's okay! There are other ways you can help! </p>
<ul>
<li>Share this campaign on social media: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr, etc. </li>
<li>Share this campaign word-of-mouth! Get your friends involved. Show them how they can help a creative community. </li>

<p>Thank you from the bottom of my heart! I can't do this without you! </p>

</div></div>","Who Am I and Who's the Community?
My name is Erin Casey, and I'm an urban fantasy and YA fantasy writer, as well as a mom to seven birds (several who are rescues).

Why is this a big deal? Well, my main character, Bianca, is a werebird! Can you guess where I got the inspiration? 
For daily work, I'm a proofreader at Pearson. Volunteer wise, I'm the Communications and Student Relationships Manager at the Iowa Writers' House, a literary organization focused on providing workshops to the community and helping writers with their craft, career, and community.
I'm also the Director of The Writers' Rooms, a non-profit corporation focused on providing a free and safe environment to all writers no matter their gender, skill set, background, income, etc. I love both organizations because it gives me the chance to work with the literary community and help people with their writing. 
""The Purple Door District"" started out as part of a canon that AE Kellar and I are writing together and hoping to publish in the future. PDD was a smaller component of it, but I fell in love with the concept and asked if I could write a series based on it to help support our main canon. She has been vital in helping me make sure I keep my facts straight! We jokingly say that she's the brain and I'm the heart of our series. I couldn't have done this without her. 
Now I'm looking back to the community for help. My dream is to become an author and help inspire other people. Community plays a big part in my life now, because it was something I grew up without as a child. ""The Purple Door District"" is all about people of different backgrounds, abilities, and beliefs coming together to save a young woman from being hunted. I'm going to self-publish this book, but I need help. The funds are much greater than I expected, and at the same time, I want to support artists, marketers, and editors who believe in this story and want to help bring it to life. 
Your generous contributions will allow me to publish the books and support additional creators: 

Writer and Editor Leona Bushman who edited the book and is an author herself.


Writer and Proofreader, Shakyra Dunn who proofread and sensitivity read my book. See her book down below. 


Artist Gabriella Bujdoso who has graciously agreed to create character art (coming soon). 


Artist Oni Algarra who is creating character portraits. (Bianca is featured below)  


PA specialist Sara Cunningham PA who creates marketing items that you can both get for free or purchase to help you get immersed in ""The Purple Door District."" 



Jewelry maker Amanda Bouma who will help create jewelry for the book. 

Not only would this ensure the production of this book, it would open up the possibility to a series that would continue to bring more work to you and invest in these members of the literary community. 

What I Need
My goal is to be open and honest with everyone, so here are what the funds will go towards: 

Editing through Leona Bushman $500
Author Website Maintenance (x1year) $300  (so I can continue to hold author interviews and provide writing tips and publicity to the community). 
Business Cards $40
Book printing through Ingramspark ($4.81 per book) x 100   $600 (shipping included)
Book printing through Ingramspark (hard cover 10.84) x 10 Special Edition  $120 (shipping included)
Ingramspark Print and Ebook Set up  $50
ISBN through IngramSpark and Browker (10 ISBNs)   $300  (more ISBNs now means I can provide the books in various platforms) 
Art Marketing  $500 (for Gabriella/Oni)
Promotional Publishing/swag  $500 (for Sara Cunningham PA)
Cover $50 (for artist on Fiverr)
E-book Conversion   $100  (to convert the paper book to an e-book so it's available to more people)
Audio Conversion  $300   (to convert to an audiobook for people who have trouble with reading. I want to make it accessible to as many people as possible. This would likely go towards a local author I have in mind for audio work.) 
Copyright $25
Additional Costs (additional marketing/publicity, donation books, office supplies, ec). 

What You Get

Character portraits and art! Just look at those awesome pictures by Oni and Gabriella
Book swag!
First look at items to be sold alongside ""The Purple Door District"" by PA Extraordinaries and the chance to be the first to receive them
Jewelry and items that I and Amanda Bouma create for ""The Purple Door District"" 
E-books
Printed copies
A one-on-one writing talk with me
and much more! 


The Impact
I can't even express how important your support is. Self-publishing is becoming a  more respected form of publishing, and I can't do it without your help. In a time when our country feels so divided, I think it's valuable to bring a book with a diverse cast to the community. The main character is Latina. She works with parahumans who are Latino, Native American, black, Caucasian, LGBT, etc, and with those who have different beliefs to survive. Even if the different parahumans have prejudices against one another, they're able to put it aside to make their community safer for themselves and for their children. I hope that people who read this will see themselves in these characters. As I get deeper in to the series, I want to bring in more people of different nationalities, beliefs, and abilities so they can feel represented as well. 
You have the opportunity to see a group of creative minds come together to create this book and its future series. We can do this together, and in December, I hope you'll feel proud holding this book in your hands.

Other Ways You Can Help
I completely understand that you may not be able to donate, and that's okay! There are other ways you can help! 

Share this campaign on social media: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr, etc. 
Share this campaign word-of-mouth! Get your friends involved. Show them how they can help a creative community. 
Let me know what you would like to see promoted. More jewelry? More art? What representation do you want to see in future books? 

 
Thank you from the bottom of my heart! I can't do this without you! 
Cheers!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>So here's the deal. This campaign and the book, while hilarious, are not a joke. I really did write a book about the Definition of Sport and I really do need help sending it to sports media personalities. And I actually <u>mean</u> the definition; it is not intended as a gimmick. I believe that the definition in <i>WHAT IS SPORT?</i>  accurately distinguishes between sports and those activities that, while very physical, should be characterized as something else, like ""Athletitives"" or chid birth.  </p>

<p>Your money will send the book to the media entities and people listed in the perks and will help defray some of the costs of publication.  </p>
<p>Sport is not the most important thing in the world. Cinnabon is. And family and healthcare and human trafficking and criminal justice and education and spiritual and religious formation. But we find a lot of collective and personal solace participating, watching, and analyzing sport. It has a significant place in the fullness of the human experience.  And practically speaking, we simply live in a culture dominated by around the clock media coverage and debate.  <i>WHAT IS SPORT?</i> antagonizes and then resolves a small piece of that on-going debate.  Here's a link to the Tiny Talk I did for TEDxGreenville that generally summarizes the definition:</p>

<p>""The Guide, however, remains more an observation as to the natural order of things than some argument.

Like all great science, the Author of the Guide is simply identifying that which already is, or the way things are, rather than attempting to propose how they should or ought to be. The definition of sport, therefore, flows from the truth of the very thing itself. It is not an attempt to conjure a definition but instead to describe one. It is natural law. And, in that sense, any disagreement you might have with it is necessarily one with the universe, so to speak, and not with the courage of the Author to transcribe it.

<p>Aunque el hombre se encuentra solo en el cuarto de hotel, su cabeza no deja mantener conversaciones imaginarias con las personas que de una u otra manera están involucradas con él. Su novia, una prostituta, su padre (quien estuvo entre los más buscados del FBI), su hermano. Todos ellos, quizá más personas forman parte de esas últimas dos horas en el 32-124 del Mandalay Bay.</p>
<p>¿Qué lleva a un hombre, aparentemente sano y normal, a una acción así? ¿Qué pasa por su cabeza mientras prepara el tiroteo? Sobre eso quiere reflexionar esta obra aún sin título. No quiere contestar tajantemente ninguna pregunta, sólo abrir posibilidades.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On October 1st, 2017, Stephen Paddock shoot from the window of his room at the Mandalay Bay Hotel against approximately twenty-two thousand attendees to a country music concert. It's not yet clear why. This work focuses on the last two hours before that event, when Paddcok was alone in his hotel room, while reflecting on what he was about to do.</p>
<p>Although the man is alone in the hotel room, his head is not, allowing imaginary conversations with people who are in one way or another involved with him. His girlfriend, a prostitute, his father (who was among the FBI's most wanted), his brother. All of them, maybe more, are part of those last two hours in the room 32-124 of Mandalay Bay.</p>
<p>What brings a man, apparently healthy and normal, to such an action? What goes through his head while he prepares the shooting? We don´t want to give any answers, just explore the possibilities.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Otras formas de ayudar / Other ways you can help</h3>
<p>Sé que no es fácil ayudar a veces económicamente, pero puedes ayudarme difundiendo la campaña entre tus amigos y conocidos, quizá alguien de tus contactos esté interesado y en posibilidades de ayudar.</p>
<p>Otra forma de ayudar es comprando una versión digital de mi primera obra La Princesa y El Ministro. Esta obra obtuvo el Premio Bellas Artes Baja California de Dramaturgia en 2017, el más importante de México. Está disponible en Amazon en español, inglés y francés. No necesitas un KIndle para leerla, puedes bajar la app gratuita y leerla en cualquier dispositivo. Aquí el link:</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.amazon.com.mx/s?k=Alonso+Fiallega&amp;__mk_es_MX=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.amazon.com.mx/s?k=Alonso+Fiallega&amp;a...</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I know sometimes it´s hard to help with money, but it would be a great help if you tell your friends and family about this project. Maybe someone of them would be intrsted and able to help.</p>
<p>Another way is buying a digital versiona of my play The Princess &amp; The Minister. This play won the Baja California Fine Arts Award for Playwrighting in 2017, the most important award in Mexico. Tha play is available in spanish, english and french in Amazon. You don´t need a Kindle to read it, you can download the free app on any device, and read it. Here is the link:</p>

On October 1st, 2017, Stephen Paddock shoot from the window of his room at the Mandalay Bay Hotel against approximately twenty-two thousand attendees to a country music concert. It's not yet clear why. This work focuses on the last two hours before that event, when Paddcok was alone in his hotel room, while reflecting on what he was about to do.
Although the man is alone in the hotel room, his head is not, allowing imaginary conversations with people who are in one way or another involved with him. His girlfriend, a prostitute, his father (who was among the FBI's most wanted), his brother. All of them, maybe more, are part of those last two hours in the room 32-124 of Mandalay Bay.
What brings a man, apparently healthy and normal, to such an action? What goes through his head while he prepares the shooting? We don´t want to give any answers, just explore the possibilities.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>A long time ago I took a graduate course about women and autobiography. There I learned about a woman named Vladka Meed, who smuggled guns and dynamite into the Warsaw Ghetto in preparation for the Uprising (among many other important tasks). And I was horrified; horrified that I'd never heard of her before.</p>
<p>As my research went deeper, I discovered so many equally amazing women involved in the Warsaw Jewish Underground during World War II that I also hadn't heard of. I couldn't believe I didn't know any of their names! So, it was time for me to take this into my own hands: if no one else was going to make sure these badass bitches'* names were as well-known as Anne Frank's, then I would. And that's what I'm trying to do.</p>
<p>Hi, my name is Elizabeth Hyman, and I am the granddaughter of a Polish Jewish Holocaust refugee. I earned my Master's degree in Modern Jewish History, and I work as an archivist at the Center for Jewish History in New York. The topic of women and the Holocaust is one I hold near to my heart, and one I have been writing about for many years, long before I had the idea for this book. </p>
<p>Indeed, since 2011, I have been writing a history blog. As of this writing I have over 116,000 followers. You may learn more over at my website: <a href=""https://historicitywasalreadytaken.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://historicitywasalreadytaken.com/</a>.

<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This isn't going to be an academic history, and it's not going to be another chronological narrative of 1939-1945. This book is driven by female actors. Their words, their actions, and their thoughts drive the narrative. And to get into their heads, I need access to works published only in Hebrew, Yiddish, and Polish; I need access to books not published in the United States; and I need access to archival materials housed in Poland and Israel.</p>
<p>In other words, to get my hands on the sources I need to do this book correctly, I need to be able to pay multiple translators, for overseas shipping of potentially rare volumes, and for archival copying (which adds up fast once you factor in labor and digital infrastructure). I will also need to pay for a professional editor; in nonfiction publishing, successful writers generally have an editor review their submission materials before those materials go out to any agent. This professional service can also be quite expensive. A conservative estimate of what I need to pay for all of this is $5000. And when I say ""conservative,"" I mean ""that might pay for the translation of one book.""</p>

<h3>Your Impact</h3>
<p>The Holocaust is one of the turning points of Modern History. Yet, our collective understanding of it is deeply informed by male narratives, and the male experience. That means we're missing half the picture of the largest mechanized genocide in human history. Please, help me do my part to shed a light on the other half: their deeds, their lives, their fears, and, sometimes, their deaths. </p>

With a groundbreaking job system that combined the usual character classes like knights, thieves, and mages with offbeat classes such as chemists, dancers, and bards, the game appeared to be a shoo-in for North American distribution. But the game was dubbed ""too hardcore"" for a Western audience and was swapped out with Final Fantasy Mystic Quest, a simplistic new game tailor-made for Americans.  </p><p>That didn't stop a teenage Chris Kohler from tracking down Final Fantasy V. The young RPG fan got a Japanese copy of the game, used it to teach himself Japanese, and with the help of some internet companions created the first-ever comprehensive English-language FAQ of the game. As the internet narrowed the cultural gap between the East and West more each year, the game was eventually translated into English for the PlayStation, Game Boy Advance, and iOS. </p><p>Fans in the West finally got to learn what all the fuss was about. Now the acclaimed author of Power-Up and an editor at Kotaku, Kohler is revisiting the game that started his career in games journalism. Based on new, original interviews with Final Fantasy V's director, Hironobu Sakaguchi, as well as previously untranslated interviews with the rest of the development team, Kohler's book weaves history and criticism to examine one of the Final Fantasy series's greatest and most overlooked titles.</p><p><i>​Chris Kohler is the author of Power-Up: How Japanese Video Games Gave the World an Extra Life, and the founding editor of Game|Life, the Webby-nominated video game section of WIRED. He is currently Features Editor of Kotaku, and lives in the San Francisco Bay Area. </i></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503957713/nu6di5qs9okuortbjksu.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><strong>Shovel Knight by David L. Craddock</strong></p><p>In 2014, Yacht Club Games released its very first game, Shovel Knight, a joyful 2D platformer that wears its NES influences on its sleeve. This unlikely pastiche of 8-bit inspirations manages to emulate the look, feel, and even the technical limitations of nostalgic titles like Mega Man, Zelda II, and Castlevania III—imbued with a contemporary sense of humor and self-awareness. But how is a fundamentally retro game created in the modern era?

The generous backers of our first Kickstarter campaign said “MAKE IT HAPPEN!” and Boss Fight Books was born. Thanks to your continued support since then, we've released sixteen great books about classic video games, and we've got so much more planned for the future. For Season 4, we're offering five all-new books by six all-new writers. This time around, every book this season shares one thing in common: unprecedented access to people who made these games. In our first ever Creator Access Edition, you'll meet a diverse group of creators and characters, including:
Final Fantasy legend Hironobu Sakaguchi
Mark Turmell's team behind NBA Jam, including announcer Tim Kitzrow
Knights of the Old Republic Lead Designer James Ohlen and Senior Writer Drew Karpyshyn
Yacht Club Games, the entire team behind Shovel Knight
the team behind Postal, and infamous video game film director Uwe Boll
We hope you’ll subscribe to Season 4 and join us as we explore these fascinating games.For Season 4, we've enlisted designer Cory Schmitz to give our covers an updated aesthetic that will look great on your shelf alongside all of our previous titles. Each book is numbered and collectible, and will have the usual crisp, elegant interiors thanks to returning layout designer Christopher Moyer.All the books will be available in:
Paperback: 5x7-inch, matte finish, 128-222 pages.
eBook: DRM-free in EPUB, MOBI, and PDF formats.
and will be sold directly from bossfightbooks.com, in the Kindle Store, and in more bookstores than ever before thanks to our new distributor, SCB Distributors.Final Fantasy V by Chris KohlerWhen Final Fantasy V was released for the Japanese Super Famicom in 1992, the game was an instant hit, selling two million copies in the first two months alone. With a groundbreaking job system that combined the usual character classes like knights, thieves, and mages with offbeat classes such as chemists, dancers, and bards, the game appeared to be a shoo-in for North American distribution. But the game was dubbed ""too hardcore"" for a Western audience and was swapped out with Final Fantasy Mystic Quest, a simplistic new game tailor-made for Americans.  That didn't stop a teenage Chris Kohler from tracking down Final Fantasy V. The young RPG fan got a Japanese copy of the game, used it to teach himself Japanese, and with the help of some internet companions created the first-ever comprehensive English-language FAQ of the game. As the internet narrowed the cultural gap between the East and West more each year, the game was eventually translated into English for the PlayStation, Game Boy Advance, and iOS. Fans in the West finally got to learn what all the fuss was about. Now the acclaimed author of Power-Up and an editor at Kotaku, Kohler is revisiting the game that started his career in games journalism. Based on new, original interviews with Final Fantasy V's director, Hironobu Sakaguchi, as well as previously untranslated interviews with the rest of the development team, Kohler's book weaves history and criticism to examine one of the Final Fantasy series's greatest and most overlooked titles.​Chris Kohler is the author of Power-Up: How Japanese Video Games Gave the World an Extra Life, and the founding editor of Game|Life, the Webby-nominated video game section of WIRED. He is currently Features Editor of Kotaku, and lives in the San Francisco Bay Area. Shovel Knight by David L. CraddockIn 2014, Yacht Club Games released its very first game, Shovel Knight, a joyful 2D platformer that wears its NES influences on its sleeve. This unlikely pastiche of 8-bit inspirations manages to emulate the look, feel, and even the technical limitations of nostalgic titles like Mega Man, Zelda II, and Castlevania III—imbued with a contemporary sense of humor and self-awareness. But how is a fundamentally retro game created in the modern era? And what do the games of the past have to teach today's game designers?  Based on extensive original interviews with the entire Yacht Club Games team, writer David L. Craddock unearths the story of five game developers who worked so well together while at WayForward Games that they decided to start their own studio. From the high highs of Shovel Knight's groundbreaking Kickstarter to the low lows of its unexpectedly lengthy development, Boss Fight presents a new master class in how a great game gets made.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>You want to change the world. Maybe you’re even audacious enough to want saving the world to be fun. But real problems are messy, and it can often feel difficult to get people to care.  But what if saving the earth were a game? Not just any game, but the greatest game we’ve ever played?</p>
<p>I've just completed the ultimate ""how to"" manual that will turn you into a  world-changing superstar, and I want to share it with you. It's finished. It's in the final stages of editing, and it's ready to send to you at the end of this campaign in mid-November 2018.</p>
<p><i>How</i> <i>to</i> <i>Save</i> <i>the</i> <i>World</i> is a workbook that helps social and environmental change professionals learn how to implement powerful techniques, drawn from behavioral psychology, measurement, design, data, storytelling, visualization, and game design that are proven to have impact.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528501531/ve3ix0kzxpfulvddb8hx.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The design framework taught in this workbook will take you through a journey of exercises, questions, and case studies that will teach you the art of changing the world — and it’s often not what you think it is.</p>
<p>For example, did you know that just showing people the number of cans recycled increased the recycling rate by 67%? Or that letting people know that prior customers chose vegan meals doubled the rate of plant-based meal orders? Jam-packed full of fascinating insights, this book will help unleash your highest creativity and help you take giant leaps in your capacity to create real and measurable change for the causes you most care about.</p>
<p>The approach taught in <i>How</i> <i>to</i> <i>Save</i> <i>the</i> <i>World</i> means not just tinkering around the edges, or merely <i>talking</i> about change. It will help you design solutions that reach the cores of your issues, so you can experience the incredible joy and satisfaction of seeing your work, really, actually change the world every single day.</p>

<h3>Who's it for?</h3>
<p>This book is a must-have for anyone pursuing meaningful change in the world. It's written for social change entrepreneurs, designers, sustainability professionals, environmental advocates, student activists, engineers, city planners, civic technologists, tech startups, and community organizers. Whether you are just starting your search for meaningful work, or you've spent a lifetime's career campaigning for change, <i>How to Save the World</i> will add techniques you haven't heard of, inspiration to creatively flower, and a roadmap to chart your future journey for solving the world's biggest problems. The unique design-thinking process in the book will help both experienced and aspiring world-changers discover their next big idea.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>What's involved in this campaign:</p>
<ul>
<li>The campaign goal covers an initial print run, editor's fees, and some promotion. </li>
<li>You'll receive the first-ever print run of this book, with your name on the thank-you page and a special thank-you video with all the supporter's names. </li>
<li>Don't worry if we don't reach the goal, all orders will still be printed and distributed through the print-on-demand service Blurb.com. </li>
</ul>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The difference your contribution will make:</p>
<ul>
<li>This project is valuable to me because it helps me share these insights and my unique take on how optimism, vision, and creativity can make the world better. It helps me continue to read academic case studies, turn this knowledge into real change, and share it with my community of world-changers. </li>
<li>This project is valuable to the world because the movement of world-changers hasn't had a manual before. We haven't had a big inspirational manifesto on how to get to work on making saving the world our art form. In a world that is often mired in doom, frustration, and politics, the approach in this book of looking at measurement, technology, and creativity is a beacon of positivity. Many world-changers are making mistakes without realizing it, and this book shines a light on these mistakes and new ways of fixing the world. </li>

Short Summary
You want to change the world. Maybe you’re even audacious enough to want saving the world to be fun. But real problems are messy, and it can often feel difficult to get people to care.  But what if saving the earth were a game? Not just any game, but the greatest game we’ve ever played?
I've just completed the ultimate ""how to"" manual that will turn you into a  world-changing superstar, and I want to share it with you. It's finished. It's in the final stages of editing, and it's ready to send to you at the end of this campaign in mid-November 2018.
How to Save the World is a workbook that helps social and environmental change professionals learn how to implement powerful techniques, drawn from behavioral psychology, measurement, design, data, storytelling, visualization, and game design that are proven to have impact.

The design framework taught in this workbook will take you through a journey of exercises, questions, and case studies that will teach you the art of changing the world — and it’s often not what you think it is.
For example, did you know that just showing people the number of cans recycled increased the recycling rate by 67%? Or that letting people know that prior customers chose vegan meals doubled the rate of plant-based meal orders? Jam-packed full of fascinating insights, this book will help unleash your highest creativity and help you take giant leaps in your capacity to create real and measurable change for the causes you most care about.
The approach taught in How to Save the World means not just tinkering around the edges, or merely talking about change. It will help you design solutions that reach the cores of your issues, so you can experience the incredible joy and satisfaction of seeing your work, really, actually change the world every single day.
 
 
What people are saying
 
""An urgent and useful guide for anyone who seeks to make a difference. It will change your work for the better."" - Seth Godin Author, This is Marketing
 
""I am loving How to Save the World  . . .  I am only halfway through it, and cannot wait to read it again soon. So many gems! Thanks for putting this out into the world."" - Erin Rhodes, Writer & Speaker on The Zero Waste Lifestyle
 
""How to Save the World – WOW!  This remarkable book continues Katie’s amazing journey. It is easy to read, practical and full of ways for you to act, and help us survive in a world where the evidence of climate change and sustainability collapse can be frightening, and even bring on despair. But, as Al Gore told us: “Never Despair, it’s a form of denial.”  Katie’s enthusiasm shines from every page, and fires hope for my grandchildren. I urge all to read this book, to “think beautifully”, and get out there and do epic things to save the world. Never has this call to action been more damn serious."" - Professor David A Hood AM HonFIEAust CPEng, Chairman, The Long Future Foundation, 2012 National President, Engineers Australia
 
""I am a complete novice at game design, yet I have found the book to be well designed, beautifully  explained, and crystal clear in terms of explanations. Katie presents her material brilliantly and passionately. This book and the games it will enable are a great opportunity to explore real innovation at the edge of how people are learning and changing behavior. This is a rare resource!"" -  Tim Bennet, Agricultural Scientist, Investor, Consultant to the United Nations Center for Alleviation of Poverty by Sustainable Agriculture



 

 



 
""Katie's teachings gave me a solid base to begin the challenging task of tracking change . . . having been turned down for a grant or two for this very reason (we didn't have the behavior-change data the foundations wanted), I hadn't understood how to even begin collecting this information in a meaningful way until I participated in this workshop."" - Constance Taylor, California Center for Natural History
 



 




 
“Katie’s book on approaching the sometimes fraught topic of global environmental change and the actions that can help save the world is exactly what “change-wanters” should read! By presenting the state of knowledge in what actually works, in a way that we can all understand, using beautiful and simple graphics, Katie has delivered something useful for all walks of life, from all corners of the world.” - Jeremy S. Hoffman, Ph.D., The Science Museum of Virginia
 


 

 

 

 

 
""Great stuff! Strong material presented in a very captivating way. The way Katie gave several hi-tech and lo-tech implementation ideas for each gamification technique made it feel both approachable and aspirational.""  - Eugene Otter, Software Engineer

Our campaign was relaunched.
Check out the NEW CAMPAIGN!

The heart of Vector scissors is a solution to a common problem which a lot of us already knows: If you want to cut a large piece of paper or some kind of material you have to pre-mark the line for which you need to use a ruler and a pencil.



If you use a cutting knife you will also need an under plate in case you don't want to scratch your tabletop. This is why I wanted to create a new type of scissors which can cut straight lines without using additional tools. 















The top/left part of Vector sits on top of the table while the bottom/right half presses against the side of it. 



To cut a straight line, you simply place your paper over the corner of a table, providing the right angle for you to begin cutting.


You start going forward and Voila!  A straight cut from a scissor – something you never could have done before!

Main advantages

- Straight
cuts without using additional tools 
- everyday
use besides straight cut 
- Unlimited
cutting length
- easy
handling
- Comfortable,
convenient use











""Yet when to comes to the common task of cutting in a straight line, craftspeople would have little choice but to break out heavy-duty solutions like paper cutters. Concepts like the Vector Scissors..., may someday fill that void...



""Genius! Scissors have evolved slowly over the years ... Designer Tamás Fekete has sliced through millennia of shear repetition and designed a new pair of scissors…""


Vector Scissors are one of those designs that make you say “duh!” For the 99.9% of us who can’t cut a straight line, they make getting it right each time a cinch.









The early concept of Vector scissors was the end result of my first year project at the Moholy-Nagy University of Art and Design where I study at the faculty of product design. After the concept created quite a buzz around the web and a lot of people were interested in having Vector Scissors, we decided to make it become a real product. 






Handcrafted in Hungary






The blades of Vector are handcrafted in
Hungary. They are made of stainless steel from Solingen which are tempered,
individually whetted and adjusted precisely by hand. Therefore Vector scissors are not just accurate, but  they are also beautiful pieces of craftsmanship.

Another portion will go toward paying someone to proofread the manuscript and do some minor editing. The rest will go towards purchasing the copies - 300 in total for the first print run, getting a .pdf version made for those who prefer their books digital, mailing out the preorders that I receive through this campaign, and promotion: getting posters made, sending out review copies, and transportation costs so I can do readings, etc. If there is any tiny amount of extra money left over, it will be put toward a second printing.</p>
<p>But I'm not asking for something for nothing - anyone who contributes over $10 gets a .pdf copy of the book, and the perks get better the more you contribute - signed copies of the book, poster prints of the cover art, and more.</p>
<p>If I don't reach my goal, I still plan on publishing the book. What not reaching my goal would mean is that I wouldn't be able to make the initial print run as big, but the book would still get printed. If the goal is not reached, I will put any funds I receive toward doing as big a print run as possible. However, it will take me longer to get it printed and mailed out if I don't reach the goal, so if you'd like your copy sooner rather than later, try and get the word out about my campaign and help me reach my funding goal.</p>

Not to mention, I had some success with more traditional publishing when I was younger, and it left a bad taste in my mouth. There was a lot of editing and cutting not only of extraneous things but of things that were intrinsic to the message of my writing. A lot of talk of certain things being unpublishable, either because of the risk of censorship, or because of market trends and what would sell. Well. I hate censorship and I don't care about market trends. In the case of <i>What We Talk About </i> - I'm a punk, I write for punks.</p>
<p>Self-publishing may be a shortcut on the one hand, but on the other hand it takes a whole lot of hard work. It means that I have ultimate control over the book, but also that I have ultimate responsibility. It means that I am responsible for finding an artist and an editor.

</div></div>","This is an extremely unique
project with profound personal and global implications. It is the
writing/co-birthing of a book entitled, ‘Water Lillies' – the story of an
Elongation – the story of a Waking Up’. If you have already viewed the
video introduction to this project offered by the writer, Ariole, you will know
how special this project is. The contents of this book are flowing through
Ariole and published daily online. The book is the magnet at the core of a Call
to Global Cooperation in response to the multi-faceted and interconnected global crises of which
we are all a part – more on this issue in a moment. Appearing in the form of a ‘book’, Water Lillies is also

its original memory of itself as Light. In simpler terms, The Call to Global
Cooperation through ‘Water Lillies’ is a real-time response to the
readiness of humanity to ‘grow up’ – to remember itself in its full radiant
glory.
The ‘story’ is accessible to readers from all walks of life – creeds,
colors, races, ideologies – as it bridges and connects multiple spokes of one
‘wheel’. Told in a
mystical, magical weave, it resembles Harry Potter, Mutant Messages Down Under, Raiders
of the Lost Ark, The DaVinci Code, Star Wars, The Men Who
Stare At Goats– and it
follows the sacred route of ‘Field of Dreams’ – bringing into manifest,
tangible experience what we have all long dreamed of – “peace on Earth, joy to
all humankind”. ‘Water
Lillies’ reveals in its mesmerizing pages why humanity has been
‘stuck’ for millennia – and how it is NOW that we are free to liberate
ourselves from the ‘cage’ of our own collective making . 
This Call to Global
Cooperation goes out to all among us (humanity) who are attuned to the
urgency of shifting up our species. It is a call to step out of the
perpetuation of suffering – duality – via our conditioned behaviour of
‘fighting against’ that which we do not want, to co-create a unified vision of

story of a young woman’s awakening to her full potential, it is meant to
expand our conditioned perceptions – thus easing our collective shift into
whole brain conceptions.

<p> 2. To encourage them to take a stand on such important issues as trophy hunting and the illegal trade in wild animals (which is one of the biggest illegal trades worldwide after modern-day slavery and drug trafficking); and<br/> </p>

“Our aim is to
inspire young people to become future 
conservation heroes,”
Tanya dos Santos,
Investec Rhino Lifeline
We
couldn’t agree more.  The African
Wildlife Series of children’s books has three inter-related aims:

To introduce sub-teenage and teenage
children to the wonders of Africa’s rich diversity of wild life;
To encourage them to take a stand on such
important issues as trophy hunting and the illegal trade in wild animals (which
is one of the biggest illegal trades worldwide after modern-day slavery and
drug trafficking – bigger even than illegal arms sales); and
To persuade them to embark on the wonderfully
rich journey of a lifelong relationship with books and reading.

There
is no argument that Africa’s wild life is under threat. The recent social media
storm around US dentist Robert Palmer and his killing of Cecil the Lion in
Southern Africa, shows that millions of people are vehemently opposed to trophy
hunting.  Sadly, as happens so often in
the new digital age, the storm died down and trophy hunting continues unabated,
despite protest marches in cities across the world.
The
rhino poaching saga shows how quickly criminal elements move in when they sense
an opportunity for profit.  
Twenty rhino
are slaughtered every week in Southern Africa, and the illegal trade in rhino
horn is showing no signs of slowing down. 
With rhino horn – which is nothing more than an agglomeration of hair follicles
– now worth more per ounce than gold, a couple of kilos of hair can bring the
gangsters more profit than a containerful of sex slaves.
It
is possible that your children may in the future be asked the question,
“Grandpa, what were rhinos?”  This is a
situation to be avoided at all costs.
But
the possibility of extinction for our only living link to the dinosaurs is not
the sole reason for action.  Lions are
not endangered and trophy hunting probably kills fewer than disease: our
opposition to trophy hunting is not just in order to save the lions – it is to
prevent humans from behaving in an amoral fashion.  And most people would agree that poking a gun
through a fence and shooting a caged lion is simply unacceptable.
However,
just because we are fully signed up to the cause of the wild animals, we should
not lose sight of the bad situations in which many humans find themselves in Africa.
Poverty is endemic here in Southern Africa, particularly in the rural areas,
and Zululand is as poor as anywhere else.
The
contrasts are stark.  In Johannesburg,
six-lane highways connect the city with its suburbs, million dollar
high-rise buildings glint in the sunshine, almost everyone carries a
cell-phone, internet banking is old news (and very efficient) and supermarkets
offer everything from imported Canadian salmon to fillet steak.
Where
I live, despite the government’s best efforts, people still use outside drop
toilets, many women and children walk miles every day to fetch water, and household
electricity is a distant dream. One little-known statistic is that 50% of South
Africans have never been inside a supermarket.
In
such a climate, with an unemployment rate above 25%, it is almost impossible
for rural people to find work, so any attempt to assist them deserves our help.
It
is for this reason that we have chosen the Zulu beadwork initiative as one of
the beneficiaries of our project.  There
are fewer than 800 qualified beaders in KwaZulu-Natal, with more undergoing
training.  We have chosen two beadwork
items to offer as perks to those people who join our team.
The
first one is a badge designed by our team, which we plan to sell later to raise
funds for the fight against rhino poaching, and the other is a standard
ballpoint pen, transformed by beading into a must-have conversation piece and
work of art.
Whichever
one of the two you choose (hopefully both), it will be shipped to you as soon
as possible after the close of our campaign. And your copy or copies of “Lennie
the Lion” will be shipped to you before Christmas.
We
are publishing two editions of the book – a “European/English” edition (ISBN
978-0-9946606-3-3) and a “United States/Canada” edition (ISBN 978-0-9946606-2-6),
so that you can choose whichever spelling your kids will find more acceptable.
You will find the two variants of Chapter 1 below, with the only change being the alternative spelling of the word color/colour (There are some chapters with several changes).

Chapter 1
When
Lennie was born, under a thornbush in the Imfolozi National Park in Zululand,
South Africa, he looked just like his brother and sisters. There were five of
them, two boys and three girls, and they all grew up together playing the games
that lion cubs play, while their mother rested after a long night of hunting
for food.
As
they got older, Lennie and his brother grew a little faster than their sisters,
so that by the time their first birthday rolled round, it was easy to see which
were the boys and which the girls.  Even
though Lennie and his brother were a little bigger, this did not mean they were
regular winners of the wrestling and pouncing games that the cubs played all
day long.
And
then, after the sad day when Lennie’s brother tried to play catch with a puff
adder, Lennie became the only boy in the brood. 
When
the four of them turned two, Lennie’s mane – which would make him look
different even to people who knew very little about lions – had started to
grow.  He no longer looked like his
sisters, and he wouldn’t grow up to look much like his father either, for the
first few hairs of Lennie’s mane were really, really black.
All
male lions have manes, the huge shaggy hairstyle that starts to grow when they
are about two years old. By the time they are grown-up, it covers not only
their heads and ears but also much of their shoulders as well.  This helps to protect them in a fight, and in
most male lions – almost all of them, in fact – that hair is the same golden color (colour) as the rest of their bodies. But a very few
male lions are blessed with a black mane, and this makes them rare and special.
Lennie
was going to be one of those.

</p>
<p>Im September 2014 wurde die Liste 
angeblich „sicherer Herkunftsstaaten“ auf Serbien, Mazedonien und 
Bosnien-Herzegowina erweitert. Trotz massiver Proteste von zahlreichen 
Menschenrechtsorganisationen. Ein Gutachten von Dr. Reinhard Marx und 
Dr. Karin Waringo aus dem vergangen Jahr zu Serbien, Mazedonien
 und Bosnien Herzegowina erläuterte die verfassungsrechtlichen Vorgaben 
und die menschenrechtliche Situation in den einzelnen Ländern und zeigt 
das Ausmaß an menschenrechtlichen Defiziten in den Balkanstaaten auf. 
Besonders gefährdet sind Minderheitsangehörige und Homosexuelle. Hetze 
und rassistische Angriffe sind an der Tagesordnung. Einen effektiven 
Schutz durch Polizei und Justiz gibt es nicht.<br/>
Dr Reinhard Marx schließt daraus, dass das Gesetz zur Einstufung von Serbien, Mazedonien und Bosnien Herzegowina als “Sichere Herkunfsstaaten mit EU-Recht nicht zu vereinbaren ist:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Es “stellt ausschließlich auf staatliche 
Verfolgungen und Übergriffe ab und verfehlt damit den unionsrechtlich 
maßgebenden Rechtsmaßstab für die Einstufung eines Staates als „sicherer
 Herkunftsstaat“.<br/>
Soweit festgestellt wird, es finde „keine Verfolgung oder sonstige 
systematische menschenrechtswidrige Behandlung“ statt, verfehlt er die 
maßgebenden verfassungs- und unionsrechtlichen Prüfkriterien. (…) Die 
Einschätzung, dass die Verhältnisse „ansonsten mit Staaten in der 
Region, darunter auch EU-Mitgliedstaaten, vergleichbar“ seien, wird 
durch Berichte internationaler und nichtstaatlicher Organisationen nicht
 bestätigt. (…)<br/>
Homo- und Transsexuelle sind häufig Opfer von Gewaltverbrechen. 
Homophobie ist in der mazedonischen Gesellschaft weitverbreitet und 
hindert diese daran, ihre Sexualität frei auszuleben. Diskriminierungen 
und Stigmatisierungen dieser Personengruppen sind weit verbreitet und 
werden insbesondere dadurch verstärkt, dass Mitglieder der Regierung, 
andere Politiker wie auch Medien Vorurteile gegen diese schüren.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dr. Karin Waringo beschreibt auf u.a. auf
 Basis von Dokumente der EU-Kommission, des US State Departments und des
 Menschenrechtskommissars des Europarats die Situation Schwule, Lesben 
und Transsexuelle:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Ähnlich wie in anderen Staaten 
Südosteuropas ist Homophobie in der mazedonischen Gesellschaft 
weitverbreitet und hindert Schwule, Lesben und Transsexuelle daran, ihre
 Sexualität frei auszuleben. Besonders bedenklich ist, dass sie in 
Mazedonien weder durch Aufklärung noch durch Sanktion bekämpft wird, 
sondern z.T. bis in Regierungskreise hinein geschürt wird. (…)<br/>
In der alljährlichen Bewertung der rechtlichen Gleichstellung von 
Schwulen, Lesben und Transsexuellen der Internationale Schwulen, Lesben 
und Transsexuellenvereinigung ILGA (International Lesbian and Gay 
Association) nimmt Mazedonien einen der letzten Plätze weltweit ein. 
(…) Damit rückt Mazedonien in der Bewertung der ILGA in den Bereich der 
Staaten, in denen die Rechte von Homo- und Transsexuellen grob 
missachtet werden. (…)<br/>
Bezeichnend ist, dass Mazedonien Diskriminierung aufgrund der sexuellen 
Orientierung trotz erheblichen Drucks von Seiten der Europäischen Union 
noch immer nicht als verbotenen Diskriminierungsgrund in sein 
Antidiskriminierungsgesetz aufgenommen hat. So ist es nach wie vor 
zulässig, Schwule und Lesben im Arbeitsprozess zu benachteiligen.”</p>

<p><b>Hej, mitt namn är Max Vesterlund Karlsson. </b></p>
<p>Jag är född &amp; uppvuxen i en förort utanför Stockholm och har länge kämpat för att fler röster ska höras i olika forum. Som ungdom från förorten kändes det smått hopplöst att försöka påverka lokala politiker - som vid tilltal ofta svarade med floskler som <i>""Ni kommer att förstå när ni är äldre"".  </i>Det här är inte en unik känsla, och jag är helt övertygad om att många känner igen sig i vuxensamhällets fördomar om unga oavsett om vi kommer från landsbygd, storstad eller förort.</p>
<p>Idag är jag ordförande för den partipolitiskt obundna föreningen <b>Fler Unga</b> <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">som har syftet att öka ungdomars politiska inflytande och att fungera som en plattform för spridning av kunskap &amp; verktyg för påverkan. </span></p>
<p><b>Initiativet till föreningen</b> Fler Unga kom sommaren 2013 efter att Almedalsveckan hade ägt rum. Över 200 evenemang där ungdomars tillvaro diskuterades men antalet ungdomar på plats var en besvikelse. Det kändes som om vi kunde räkna antal närvarande på fingrarna. Vad är det egentligen för mening att diskutera unga utan de är på plats?</p>
<p><b>Ungdomar idag</b> är mer engagerade än någonsin och vill vara med och påverka samhället. Att inte ta till vara på kraften hos unga, är att blunda för en enorm mängd kompetens, kreativitet och vilja. Genom att ifrågasätta den dystopiska fördomen om ""dagens unga"" som lat - vill vi visa vägen mot inkludering. Vi har under flera veckors tid tagit emot ansökningar (med stor spridning, från Boden till Helsingborg) - och mitt uppe i urvalsprocessen när detta skrivs.</p>
<p><b>Vi kommer att åka till almedalen i sommar</b> - <b>och det du kan bidra med</b>, är att göra det så billigt som möjligt för våra deltagare att åka med. Att priserna för att delta under veckan ofta är <b>löjligt höga</b> är ingen hemlighet och vi ställer oss emot att din inkomst ska vara en avgörande faktor för huruvida du blir lyssnad på eller inte under en av de största sammanslutningarna i Sveriges politiska etablissemang.</p>

Med din hjälp kan vi öppna upp Almedalen, sänka medelåldern - och på sikt bidra till ett mer inkluderande politiskt klimat. 
Fler Unga i Almedalen riktar sig till ungdomar mellan 15 och 25 år från olika delar av samhället, utan tidigare engagemang inom det svenska politiska etablissemanget och med vilja och drivkraft att bygga sin egna politiska kompass samt att få träffa och bygga broar med likasinnade. 

För att öppna upp Almedalen för dessa ungdomar erbjuder Fler Unga resa och gemensamt boende till ett kraftigt reducerat pris. Det är denna satsning du kan vara med och stötta! Väl på plats i Almedalen kommer Fler Unga delta i seminarier och event samt kartlägga arbetet med inkludering. 
Det är till allas fördel att ungdomar inkluderas: samhället gagnas något enormt av att medborgare är informerade, har reell makt & inte hamnar i förlegade fack. 
 Den här kampanjen är oerhört viktig som ledstjärna i arbetet att bemöta normer & fördomar om unga. Därför behövs varje gåva!

Fler Unga i Almedalen 2015 har syftet:



Att öppna upp det historiskt slutna politiska rummet för fler unga röster
Att öka representationen och sänka medelåldern där medelåldern är hög
Att bemöta normer kring ung kompetens
Att erbjuda unga ett forum & möjlighet till personlig utveckling

   Vad vi behöver & vad du får
Eftersom vi tidigare saknat större ekonomiska medel och inte funnits registrerade som förening tillräckligt länge för att söka de flesta större bidrag förlitar vi oss på er, allmänheten & samarbetspartners.

Behovet av Fler Unga i Almedalen är stort, vilket vi såg redan förra året. Fler Unga fick enormt genomslag på sociala medier & deltog bl.a. i SVT Debatt vid hela tre tillfällen. Ibland är det svårt att känna att du passar in helt inom ramarna för ungdomsförbunden eller att du måste ställa upp på alla krav som kanske finns i andra organisationer - därför är det viktigt att det finns ett alternativ som gör att du kan delta utan tidigare ställningstagande eller engagemang.


Det finns inga dolda avgifter och allt arbete sker idéellt, vilket betyder att ditt stöd aldrig kommer att hamna i någons privata ficka. Efter projektet kommer vi att sammanställa en rapport med det ekonomiska utfallet - och vi strävar efter en så hög transparens som möjligt. Vi har också ett konto avsatt just för det här projektet. Fler Unga kommer att delta från 29 juni till 3 juli (måndag till fredag), och våra kostnader ser ut som följer: 

Boende för 18 personer strax utanför Visby
- 24000 kr
1 x Minibussar på plats för resa mellan boende - Visby
- 4000 kr
Resa till Gotland
- 17000 kr

Mat under veckan (vi kommer att laga egen mat för att hålla nere priset)

- 4000 kr
Totalt
- 49000 kr


Allt som allt kommer det alltså att kosta cirka 2950 kr per person att delta. Allt som vi samlar in & som ni väljer att ge går oavkortat till att göra almedalen mer inkluderande, genom göra vistelsen så billig som möjligt för våra deltagare.


Alla gåvor över 1000 kronor kommer att tackas offentligt genom våra sociala medier.

   Vad kraften hos unga kommer att skapa på plats

Det bör utan tvekan vara ungas intresse som styr ungdomspolitiken. Fler Ungas idé är att agera som en plattform för spridning av kunskap och verktyg för påverkan med syftet att öka ungdomars inflytande. Det går inte att överdriva hur viktigt det är att inkludera alla i relevanta debatter & i samtal om framtiden; hur viktigt det är att unga ska ha en faktisk möjlighet att diskutera politik med landets makthavare.


Efter att ha undersökt vilka grupper som är underrepresenterade är det en som står ut: unga väljare utan existerande koppling till eventuellt ungdomsförbund eller lobbyorganisation samt ungdomar från ytterstad eller förort. Det är dessa som Fler Unga i Almedalen framför allt riktar sig till, med utgångsläget att hela det politiska etablissemanget i Almedalen och samhället i stort gagnas av så stor spridning på medborgare, väljare och olika röster som möjligt.


På plats kommer Fler Unga att delta på utvalda seminarier där medelåldern behöver sänkas eller när det diskuteras frågor som är relevanta för unga. Vi kommer att ställa frågor, ta plats i paneler, diskutera med andra organisationer & företag. Vi kommer att skapa ett inkluderande sammanhang för unga på plats, och rapportera arbetet dagligen på sociala medier!

taught by my nan first, and then my dad, how to even hold a pan, I have made an
unquantifiable number of desserts, pastries, cakes of any sort and kind. I love
creativity and exploring new tastes and flavours, experimenting new recipes
using genuine products. The secret is in the simplicity of the ingredients: flour,
water, milk, eggs and butter. My dream is to publish a
cookbook, in about 500 pages, at least 250/300 recipes. (out of about 1500 recipes
that I created, interpreted and calibrated in each dosages in these years of professional pastry chef). The
cookbook will include ingredients, method of preparation and a photo of how the
final product. I hope this campaign with your contribution make me reach my dream, I also hope to make everyone happy and remind me, when you eat a dessert done from my book.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432891983/d9bby5od2dlpyqgnlcuv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Below products both raw and cooked (not yet completed the final preparation).</p>

</span></span></p><p>The cookbook will include a big variety of recipes, cakes, mousses,
desserts and many others. The mission is to make the reader of that cookbook a
great chef by following simple instructions and revealing some secrets. You can
create any type of dessert for any event, birthday, breakfast, after dinner,
with this recipe you can impress your friends with a dessert created by you like
if you were a 'professional pastry chef'.</p>
<p>In the cookbook you will also find curiosities and variants of classic and
well known recipes, such as the the croissants:</p>
<p></p><p><span><span>- Italian

<p>Below in the photo,( deleted part has been deliberately hidden ) is an example of how to create croissants inserting inside the butter to the dough in layers. Many products particularly for breakfast (Croissant, Fagottino, Croissant salty, etc.) can be frozen when they are not cooked, and you can cook them if necessary.</p>
<p>The same method of incorporation of the butter in layer is valid for 'Millefoglie'( Puff pastry)  but with different number of folds (you'll find out in the book), this procedure of folds is very important to have the true 'Millefoglie', light and friable,(another little secret), this it not the only secret.</p>

(They can change the size, but not smaller of these).</div><div>The biggest challenge will be  to<strong> translate in the English language all such recipes</strong>, I need a long time, I have already contacted the professional translators for this job.<br/>THE NAMES OF DESSERTS remain in the original language, Italian, French (Tiramisu, Croissant), in some cases where it is possible there will be an English translation. (for example for the ingredients: Italian language 'Mela',  English language 'Apple')<br/>
</div><p></p><div>

(Kg. g.. oz. lb., Etc.). I wanted to convert the units of measurement to facilitate your work of preparation, but it is very complicated, there are too many recipes. I would need at least 1 year of work with a consequent delay in publication of the cookbook .

I do this job for 30 years, I love this job, when I create a dessert we put the soul. I want my every creation is unique ........ nice to see but mainly healthy, wholesome natural ingredients.The purpose of this campaign is to publish a cookbook which includes mainly Italian pastry recipes, but also pan-European, and a small extent of the world recipes.

In my over 30 years of experience behind the craft, since I was first
taught by my nan first, and then my dad, how to even hold a pan, I have made an
unquantifiable number of desserts, pastries, cakes of any sort and kind. I love
creativity and exploring new tastes and flavours, experimenting new recipes
using genuine products. The secret is in the simplicity of the ingredients: flour,
water, milk, eggs and butter. My dream is to publish a
cookbook, in about 500 pages, at least 250/300 recipes. (out of about 1500 recipes
that I created, interpreted and calibrated in each dosages in these years of professional pastry chef). The
cookbook will include ingredients, method of preparation and a photo of how the
final product. I hope this campaign with your contribution make me reach my dream, I also hope to make everyone happy and remind me, when you eat a dessert done from my book.Below products both raw and cooked (not yet completed the final preparation).


Below an example of the book 'The Art of Desserts'.








The cookbook will include a big variety of recipes, cakes, mousses,
desserts and many others. The mission is to make the reader of that cookbook a
great chef by following simple instructions and revealing some secrets. You can
create any type of dessert for any event, birthday, breakfast, after dinner,
with this recipe you can impress your friends with a dessert created by you like
if you were a 'professional pastry chef'.
In the cookbook you will also find curiosities and variants of classic and
well known recipes, such as the the croissants:
- Italian
style Croissant 
- French style Croissant 
- Fagottino Cioccolato (Italian)
- Pain au chocolat (French)Below are some pictures:



Below in the photo,( deleted part has been deliberately hidden ) is an example of how to create croissants inserting inside the butter to the dough in layers. Many products particularly for breakfast (Croissant, Fagottino, Croissant salty, etc.) can be frozen when they are not cooked, and you can cook them if necessary.
The same method of incorporation of the butter in layer is valid for 'Millefoglie'( Puff pastry)  but with different number of folds (you'll find out in the book), this procedure of folds is very important to have the true 'Millefoglie', light and friable,(another little secret), this it not the only secret.



In the book you will find all the information for this step of preparation, storage in the freezer (for preparation of large quantities) and cooking.
Similar products but different in taste, you are free to choose what to eat.The cookbook will be printed on coated paper 110/115 g., hardcover, the size will be about 24cm x 20cm. (They can change the size, but not smaller of these).The biggest challenge will be  to translate in the English language all such recipes, I need a long time, I have already contacted the professional translators for this job.THE NAMES OF DESSERTS remain in the original language, Italian, French (Tiramisu, Croissant), in some cases where it is possible there will be an English translation. (for example for the ingredients: Italian language 'Mela',  English language 'Apple')

The units of measurement of the various ingredients, will be according to the standard: Kilogram, gram, liter, temperature C° (celsius).There are no problems, in the stores can be purchased for $ 13/18 US dollars kitchen scales with the opportunity to weigh the ingredients in different units. (Kg. g.. oz. lb., Etc.). I wanted to convert the units of measurement to facilitate your work of preparation, but it is very complicated, there are too many recipes. I would need at least 1 year of work with a consequent delay in publication of the cookbook . I hope you can forgive me for this little problem.Here's an example of some delights to prepare for you, for your children and for your friends.This cookbook can also be useful to professionals around the world, chefs, pastry chefs. The recipes are all tested and calibrated, my customers are completely satisfied with my desserts, I hope for you is the same result.I will try to make the right choice of 250/300 recipes, and I hope they will like it too you.You like the Tiramisù? the Krapfen? The profiteroles with fruit?  Saint Honoré with choco Chantilly? Strudel with 'Apple and Pine nuts'?  'Millevoglie' with exotic fruits?................ no problem, in the book there will be.This is a delicious crepe with cherry jam and cereal, you can also do with Nutella and banana, and many other variants. Can also be done savory with 'Mozzarella and Prosciutto', 'Stracchino and Rucola', or other variants, to make a snack or for dinner.You will also find Savory Pastries for your party, anniversaries, or just to stay with family or friends and drink some beer, or a glass of fine wine.If during the campaign you want to ask me a recipe for a dessert that you like please contact me and I'll try to put it in the cookbook of course if the recipe is my availability in about 1500 that I know.









It's easy as pie.



Macarons Colorful and Multi flavor (vanilla, cherry, strawberry, banana), cookies smile with Nutella, Croissants and more ( included in the book ).

<div><b>An Introduction to the Children's Book project.</b></div>
<p>                Hello, this is Paul O'Moore of the band Coconut Milk, we are an indie-rock band with a good attitude, and radiate positivity where ever possible.  I am 27 years old, and I have extensive background and experience in the field of music, marketing, and entertainment.  I am also the oldest of 7 siblings, so it would be easy to say that I have a lot of experience with children.   Earlier this year I had the idea to write a Children's Book, when I first told my peers that I was interested in writing a book, most of them just shrugged it off, until I presented a full 24 page Hard Cover prototype of my book.  I had written a lot in the past, and always been generally well received, but the first reactions that the book garnered from random test marketing at the Cincinnati Public Library were overwhelmingly positive like nothing I had seen before.   The idea was inspired by our main source of artistic imagery Chris Baker.  Chris is an artist who spends a lot of time and passion doodling fun images reminiscent of the works of Dr. Seuss.   The book will also feature a CD in the back cover, and this CD will contain Slow Songs and Lullabies recorded by the individual members of Coconut Milk.   I originally intended on crafting and binding these books myself,  but then we were featured on Local 12 News on Mother's Day with the prototype copy that I had prepared.  Now the interest in the book is soaring, and I have to admit that I could use some help in order to ensure that we meet the demand.  </p>
<p>If my goals are met, I will be able to outsource the publishing and printing of this book through professional companies who can help me to distribute the book across the country.  I would like to see copies of this book in Libraries, Bookstores, and being read by Children everywhere, but I need your help!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>The various publishing deals that I have found on the internet range from $500 for a short run of about 100 hardcopy books, up to $5,000 for full publishing and distributions of 2500 copies.   I intend to work with whatever I can bring in on here to maximize the amount of product that I can produce with your funding. %100 of all funds brought in through this campaign will go towards pressing as many copies of the book as possible.</p>
<p>Of course I am not going to ask you to give me something for nothing, so here is a breakdown of what I can offer you!</p>
<p>$5 will get you a free Digital Download of all of the currently released Coconut Milk songs,  that is 11 songs for $5!  Literally %50 cheaper than ordering the tracks from our bandcamp page.</p>

 or read a piece of speculative fiction that not
 only included Christian themes but real-world content? It used to be 
hard to find, thanks to the narrow rules defined by the publishing 
industry. The Christian market can be unkind to pieces with edgy 
content, arguing that such material has no place in Christ-centered 
fiction. And most secular markets are not always welcoming to 
speculative pieces containing Christian content, basing their decision 
on the stereotypical 'Rated-G' Christian pieces that have come out over 
the years. </p><p>That's why The Crossover Alliance was created.</p><p>The Crossover Alliance is an online publishing company built around edgy
 Christian speculative fiction - in general terms, Christ-centered 
speculative fiction with edgy content, such as sexual themes, language,

fiction by merging apocalyptic fiction with Christian themes and 
real-world content. Since crossing the boundaries of Christian and 
secular fiction, a plethora of other authors came out of the woodwork,

<p>We
 are asking for $1,500 to cover marketing, cover design, and various other business expenses for our first year's catalog.</p>
<h1><b>Your First Year's Catalog?</b></h1>
<p>Our
 fiction catalog this first year will consist of at least six books 
which will include our short story Anthologies, novels from the Alliance
 community, and new outside submissions wanting to add their books to 
our eclectic lineup. We say at least six books, because that's the <b><i>minimum </i></b>we plan on publishing <i><b>each year</b></i>.
 This first year, we know we'll have more than six books to put out

deadly car accident days earlier.<br/><div>

guilt because of the death of a newborn in a fatal car wreck, finds 
herself questioning her own spiritual beliefs. Unable to come to terms

Cynthia finds more than she bargained for when a stranger from her past 
decides to exact his revenge on her for a prior rejection.</p>
<p>When 
hundreds of meteorites start falling from the sky, Nathan, Heather and 
Cynthia all come to realize that their problems are nothing compared to 
the global crisis. While the nations scramble to position themselves

 or read a piece of speculative fiction that not
 only included Christian themes but real-world content? It used to be 
hard to find, thanks to the narrow rules defined by the publishing 
industry. The Christian market can be unkind to pieces with edgy 
content, arguing that such material has no place in Christ-centered 
fiction. And most secular markets are not always welcoming to 
speculative pieces containing Christian content, basing their decision 
on the stereotypical 'Rated-G' Christian pieces that have come out over 
the years. That's why The Crossover Alliance was created.The Crossover Alliance is an online publishing company built around edgy
 Christian speculative fiction - in general terms, Christ-centered 
speculative fiction with edgy content, such as sexual themes, language, 
drug use, or violence. The term 'edgy' not only encompasses content 
though - it can also be applied to certain situations/themes/character 
deficiencies that are not typically found or ‘allowed’ in Christian 
fiction. This unique genre crosses the line of both secular fiction and 
Christian fiction and creates a new breed - not just to appeal to a

<p>A Marines Daughter is a novel written by Al Hague about a Viet Nam Veteran Marine near the end of his tour of duty in life and he is about to face his darkest fears, regrets and scattered memories of his past life in Viet Nam and in the Corps. SGT Jon Milo was a hero but has no idea that anyone thinks he is and he certainly does not think of himself as one. Jon has held a secret for many years from his family, friends and especially his only daughter.</p>
<p>Sara is a successful attorney who has always been close to her father but has suspected that he has always been holding back. Her desire to know the secrets that make her Dad the man he is has been a part of her life since she was old enough to sense the mystery.</p>
<p>Sara is determined to help her best friend, her father, to find peace with his past and as a side benefit gain him the recognition he deserves. During this quest, she realizes she has been missing an important part of her own life but it is not too late to make changes for herself.</p>
<p>Her father is tired of struggling with his past and finally understands the time has come to confide in his ""little girl"".</p>
<p>This story about their struggles to get to the truth and come to grips with the past is intended to help non-veterans have a better understanding of what many Veterans who fought in Viet Nam have endured for so long.</p>
<p>It is also a look back at what created this Marine and certainly many others to be willing to do what his country asked of him and his feelings about that yesterday and today.</p>
<p>My background is my work as a writer for magazines for the past ten years, The idea for this story came from a couple of other Vet friends who faced similar circumstances in this story. I too am a Viet Nam Vet 100% disabled with medical issues that really have no bearing on this except my desire to point out to the world this as one example of the internal struggles so many Vets of my time still suffer from. Hopefully, the families of those vets can gain some insight as to the struggles many still are trying to work through. The second message of the story is to fathers and the importance of a healthy and close relationship with their daughters. I live in Phoenix AZ with my wife of 27 years. Retired from a business and writing career a few years ago, I enjoy the story writing process. </p>
<p>Risks for this project is to reach a large audience which my professional marketing team will be responsible for. The obvious risk is perhaps readers may not care for the story but early reviews are extremely positive including by people who have no reason to be less than honest.</p>
<p>I am convinced the message is also valuable to today's returning veterans and for that reason, I will be donating  a portion of the proceeds of book sales to The American Legion Post 97 in San Tan Valley AZ and the local chapter of Viet Nam Veterans Association in Mesa AZ., two organizations devoted to helping Veterans both men and women from all wars. </p>
<p>If this project is not for you please utilize the tools here to let others know about this project. </p>
<p>It just might have an important message for them.</p>
<p>Perks</p>
<p>Any contribution over $50.00 will receive a signed copy of the novel <strong>A Marine's Daughter</strong>. Any donation of $20.00 or more will receive a copy of the novel as an E-Book. No shipping charges in the USA,</p>
<p>The purpose of this campaign is to allow Self-publishing which is the only way to retain all rights to the material.  The funds go to the actual printing, publishing, and distribution of the novel. It will be available on Amazon, Barnes, and Noble and local and chain bookstores. My marketing team will be arranging book signings and speaking engagements as well as all forms of social media.</p>
<p>The ebooks will be available on Kindle and many others. Because I am using professionals this project has a very solid chance to be successful.  I hope the message of this book will help many people who share a common history with the protagonist Sgt Jon Milo, USMC and his daughter Sara.</p>

<h2> </h2>
<h2>Welcome to My Great Big Positive Life!</h2>
<p> My name is Lorna Park, and along with my husband Chris we are the co-founder's of My Great Big Positive Life. We are passionate about helping kids break through their fears, build their resilience and boost their confidence using the principles of Growth Mindset, Positive Psychology and Mindfulness.</p>
<p>We all want our kids to be happy, right?  We want them to lead a successful and positive life?</p>
<p>Sadly statistics are showing that kids are growing up more stressed out and anxious than ever before. With little resilience and unable to cope with the challenges of life.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Where it all began.</h3>
<p>Alongside being a wife to Chris, I am also a proud mum of two incredible boys, Charlie (11) and Jacob (6). Being a parent is just the best job in the world, but it is definitely one of the hardest, especially when you know your child is struggling. </p>
<p> Two years ago we found ourselves in that very position when our son Charlie, went from a confident, happy little boy to developing a very negative mindset during his school years, believing he was failing at everything. Suffering from anxiety and lack of confidence he would give up at the slightest hurdle, so terrified of making mistakes that he’d rather not try. He was becoming increasingly frustrated with life, and as a result was becoming a victim of his own negative self-talk, stress and worries .</p>
<p>As if the planets were somehow aligned, I happened to be during this time committing to my own journey of self development, and was lucky enough to be introduced to the approach of Growth Mindset and Positive Psychology, via Positive Psychologist and Global success coach Niyc Pidgeon. Learning about the differences between fixed and growth mindset blew my mind, as I started to identify with Charlie’s problems and understand his behaviour more. </p>
<p>Armed with this knowledge, Chris and I began to understand how to support Charlie better and our parenting style totally changed. We started to praise his effort and hard work rather than his natural ability, we encouraged mistakes so they could be learnt from, but most of all we helped him understand how his brain was working and how he could take control of it.</p>
<p>Amazingly the results were immediate.</p>
<p>As soon as he understood how he could be the boss of his brain, his behaviour,  confidence, self belief, resilience, persistence, stress levels and over all health improved significantly.</p>
<p>Having seen first hand the impact of sharing with Charlie what I had learnt, I went on the hunt for child friendly content to pass directly onto him, but I couldn’t find anything that covered everything I wanted him to know, so I set about creating something myself to enable him to navigate his own way through the emotional rollercoasters of life.</p>
<p> After speaking to other parents and realising just how many were facing similar obstacles to our own, something that started out as a small guide for my own son, soon became a mission to help as many kids as possible empower themselves with the knowledge that could change their lives.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1539713555/bqdpqyksv54qigmkrywg.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>My Great Big Positive Life: The ultimate guide to all things happy, was born.</h3>
<p>Bringing this together has been a passion project of love, sweat, tears and joy. I have personally studied hundreds of books, studies and journals in the field of Child Psychology, Positive Psychology, Growth Mindset and Mindfulness. At times I have felt overwhelmed by need to make sure I get this right. I have checked, double checked and triple checked the information provided to make sure that it has been written responsibility and although from a place of love, it can all be backed up by the scientific research that has been done in this field.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What's inside?</h3>
<p>Our “Superstar Edition”  is the ultimate self development toolkit for kids ages 9+ that will help them understand who they are, who they want to be and how they can live a positive life.</p>
<p>Our 3 in 1 guide encourages reading, creativity, journaling and purposely planning for a positive life.</p>
<p>With over 460 pages (including planner), it comes in either a gorgeous blue or orange cover, which is beautifully embossed with silver**. The planner section has been deliberately left undated so it can be started at any point during the year. Inside, it has been creatively brought to life with stunning design and illustration by the immensly talented  Lucy Munro.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1539716717/lerbimty7mvpor5vopcb.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Included in the wide range of topics is Attitude of Gratitude, Making Friends With Failure, I am, I can, I will, The Power of Yet, You Ain’t Nothing But A Goal Digger, Choose Happy, Stay True To Who You Are, Random Acts of Kindness, The Road to Resilience, Understanding Emotional Intelligence, Let your Soul Sing, Mindfulness Matters and many more.</p>
<p>Encouraging personal engagement, the emphasises is on the child to develop a deep understanding of how their brain works, where their thoughts and feelings come from, and how by developing daily habits such as, gratitudes, affirmations and intentions they can go forward with the belief that they are not only capable, but that they are worthy of living their own Great Big Positive life.</p>
<h3>Who's it for?</h3>
<p>My Great Big Positive Life ""Superstar Edition"" is not just for kids that are suffering from lack of confidence, stress or anxiety at the moment. It is for all kids, to help them understand that they are in control of who they are and that they can choose to live a confident, happy and productive life.</p>
<p>Starting their own self development journey at this key stage in their lives, will help them manage their feelings, understand themselves better and hopefully stop negative thoughts for developing in the first place.</p>

<p> </p>
</div><div>

<li>This is just the beginning... Our first  ""Superstar Edition"" (ages9+) is just the start for us, we are committed to growing My Great Big Positive Life into a movement that will help change the future for generations of kids throughout the world. </li>

Where it all began.
Alongside being a wife to Chris, I am also a proud mum of two incredible boys, Charlie (11) and Jacob (6). Being a parent is just the best job in the world, but it is definitely one of the hardest, especially when you know your child is struggling. 
 Two years ago we found ourselves in that very position when our son Charlie, went from a confident, happy little boy to developing a very negative mindset during his school years, believing he was failing at everything. Suffering from anxiety and lack of confidence he would give up at the slightest hurdle, so terrified of making mistakes that he’d rather not try. He was becoming increasingly frustrated with life, and as a result was becoming a victim of his own negative self-talk, stress and worries .
As if the planets were somehow aligned, I happened to be during this time committing to my own journey of self development, and was lucky enough to be introduced to the approach of Growth Mindset and Positive Psychology, via Positive Psychologist and Global success coach Niyc Pidgeon. Learning about the differences between fixed and growth mindset blew my mind, as I started to identify with Charlie’s problems and understand his behaviour more. 
Armed with this knowledge, Chris and I began to understand how to support Charlie better and our parenting style totally changed. We started to praise his effort and hard work rather than his natural ability, we encouraged mistakes so they could be learnt from, but most of all we helped him understand how his brain was working and how he could take control of it.
Amazingly the results were immediate.
As soon as he understood how he could be the boss of his brain, his behaviour,  confidence, self belief, resilience, persistence, stress levels and over all health improved significantly.
Having seen first hand the impact of sharing with Charlie what I had learnt, I went on the hunt for child friendly content to pass directly onto him, but I couldn’t find anything that covered everything I wanted him to know, so I set about creating something myself to enable him to navigate his own way through the emotional rollercoasters of life.
 After speaking to other parents and realising just how many were facing similar obstacles to our own, something that started out as a small guide for my own son, soon became a mission to help as many kids as possible empower themselves with the knowledge that could change their lives.
 

 
My Great Big Positive Life: The ultimate guide to all things happy, was born.
Bringing this together has been a passion project of love, sweat, tears and joy. I have personally studied hundreds of books, studies and journals in the field of Child Psychology, Positive Psychology, Growth Mindset and Mindfulness. At times I have felt overwhelmed by need to make sure I get this right. I have checked, double checked and triple checked the information provided to make sure that it has been written responsibility and although from a place of love, it can all be backed up by the scientific research that has been done in this field.
 
What's inside?
Our “Superstar Edition”  is the ultimate self development toolkit for kids ages 9+ that will help them understand who they are, who they want to be and how they can live a positive life.
Our 3 in 1 guide encourages reading, creativity, journaling and purposely planning for a positive life.
With over 460 pages (including planner), it comes in either a gorgeous blue or orange cover, which is beautifully embossed with silver**. The planner section has been deliberately left undated so it can be started at any point during the year. Inside, it has been creatively brought to life with stunning design and illustration by the immensly talented  Lucy Munro.
 
Included in the wide range of topics is Attitude of Gratitude, Making Friends With Failure, I am, I can, I will, The Power of Yet, You Ain’t Nothing But A Goal Digger, Choose Happy, Stay True To Who You Are, Random Acts of Kindness, The Road to Resilience, Understanding Emotional Intelligence, Let your Soul Sing, Mindfulness Matters and many more.
Encouraging personal engagement, the emphasises is on the child to develop a deep understanding of how their brain works, where their thoughts and feelings come from, and how by developing daily habits such as, gratitudes, affirmations and intentions they can go forward with the belief that they are not only capable, but that they are worthy of living their own Great Big Positive life.
Who's it for?
My Great Big Positive Life ""Superstar Edition"" is not just for kids that are suffering from lack of confidence, stress or anxiety at the moment. It is for all kids, to help them understand that they are in control of who they are and that they can choose to live a confident, happy and productive life.
Starting their own self development journey at this key stage in their lives, will help them manage their feelings, understand themselves better and hopefully stop negative thoughts for developing in the first place.

<p>*Testimonial.</p>
<p>Carrol Nelson is an inspirational individual, who has had a significant impact in my life! Over the years, she has been able to speak words of encouragement into many people’s lives, which are like “rays of sunshine” dropping light into an individual’s life!  Carrol is a highly creative individual who is passionate about children and young people achieving their full potential.  I know that her book is going to be an uplifting read, which will inspire and encourage children from a range of backgrounds and cultures.Andrea Nelson (Deputy Headteacher)</p>
<p>*Testimonial</p>
<p>Carrol’s coaching sessions were extremely illuminating for me. Sessions were well-structured and extremely helpful. I was coached by Carrol during a period in my life when there were several different life paths that I could take. With Carrol, I developed strategies which enabled me to gain a sense of clarity amidst feelings of confusion. I was also encouraged to uphold positive thoughts. As a result, I was able to make the best life-changing decision. Additionally, sessions enhanced my self-awareness, allowing me to realise my full potential and purpose in life. I was tasked with answering questions which I had never considered, and this also made me increasingly self-aware and further enthused to accomplish my academic, professional and personal goals. I enjoyed completing the weekly worksheets and activities set by Carrol, they allowed me to become more self-reflective. I still have these worksheets and use them as a reference in the practise of looking back in order to move forward and continually progress. I can truly say that Carrol’s sessions allowed me to develop valuable skills, helping me to see and shape my life path (always setting goals and targets). I couldn’t have asked for a better coach, thank you Carrol. Trishauna Stewart (Master's Degree Student)</p>
<p>*Testimonial</p>
<p>I was struggling with the decision of whether or not to go back to university and lacked the motivation to complete the personal statement and applications. I sat down with Carrol and we spoke about my options and was tasked to clearly consider them. I decided I definitely wanted to attend a master’s course which started approximately 3 months later and get my degree. Carrol immediately helped me break down the work into pieces and create deadlines that were personally attenable for this very short- term goal by using my strengths and recognising my weaknesses. During the following sessions, I developed a life long plan with my long-term personal goals, created a timeline and acknowledged the short-term goals that are necessary to achieve them. We discussed the barriers that were delaying my progress and was tasked with short goals and habits to start developing to allow me to grow now and more so in the future. Carrol worked with me at my pace but was not afraid to point out when I was becoming lethargic in reaching my personal goals which I needed to give me the extra push.  Each session contained questions, worksheets and activities that made me reflect on myself, as well as, what I needed to do or gain to be the best version of myself in order to achieve my goals. Then was sent away with a weekly strategy to practice or activity to complete to allow continuous development. Without Carrol’s guidance and support, I would not have met the application deadline to attend university that October. I learned so much from Carrol about myself, my surroundings, life in general, how get over hurdles with confidence and power of the magic words “I will”. Nikuare Bisson(Master Degree Student)</p>
<p>*Testimonial</p>
<p>Carrol’s coaching sessions were a welcomed opportunity for me to become more focussed in the understanding of what I wanted  to achieve for myself both in regards to my professional and personal growth. Carrol is a very warm person and I immediately felt empowered and revitalised in knowing there was someone who was there to keep me on track in a supportive and informal way. In the sessions I was able to reconnect with past and present desires, acknowledge how my own language and thinking can create barriers to these desires as well as set the necessary steps to turning desires into achievable goals. One of my main issues was finding focus and prioritising my goals which Carrol provided guidance to, remaining continuously patient  Carrol helped me to realise things could be made manageable with determination, commitment and courage. Carrol naturally helped with feelings of confidence in allowing me to appreciate all that I had already accomplished in life producing many positive outcomes. The self appreciation I acquired  aroused an inner strength and clarity which saw me seek higher paid employment, make steps towards moving home and travelling all of which was accomplished thanks  to the support Carrol as well as other factors. However without Carrol's interventions my accomplishment of my goals may have come much later or remained desires with no structure of how I could make them a reality. Much Appreciation.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p><strong>Adventures with Watersnake -<i> Exploring the Waterways of British Columbia</i></strong> shares eight adventurous water stories written by young British Columbian authors. Each story/chapter features real waterbodies and facts; some stories are fictional, and some are inspired by the author's own experiences and adventures! The seven authors are volunteer members of <a href=""https://waterlution.org/youth-advisory-board/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Waterlution's Youth Advisory Board</a>.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1542326130/slbaj8hmmzlgwfta43ln.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><a href=""https://waterlution.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Waterlution is a non-profit organization</a> working to build future water leaders in Canada, and around the world. Annually, Waterlution trains and supports a nation-wide Youth Advisory Board comprised of young professionals and post-secondary students who are passionate about water and education! The Youth Advisory are champions of water and cultural education in their communities.</p>
<p>This campaign is so very important to the Youth Advisory Board, <strong>our dream is that Adventures with Watersnake inspires many to steward and protect our most precious resource, water! </strong> All <strong>funds raised </strong>during this campaign will support <strong>educational workshops for school-aged youth</strong> in Canada. Please <strong>support our dream</strong> <strong>by helping us reach our goal!</strong></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To continue to reach more school groups in BC and across Canada, our <strong>Youth Advisors are working to raise $5000 that can help cover the costs associated with delivering workshops</strong> (For instance, some volunteers have to drive far distances to reach their schools, and some workshops require resource guests and/or materials).  Your contribution supports educational workshops for the <a href=""https://waterlution.org/great-canoe-journey/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Great Canoe Journey </a>and <a href=""https://waterlution.org/gwc/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Great Waters Challenge</a> programs, delivered by the Youth Advisors and very knowledgeable resource guests.</p>
<p><u><b>Adventures with Watersnake includes:</b></u></p>
<p><strong>- Eight stories</strong> (presented as chapters) tied together with Watersnake's narration</p>
<p>-A <strong>few black and white sketches</strong> in each chapter (as seen throughout this campaign!)</p>
<p><strong>-Five printable colouring sheets </strong>of the sketches</p>
<p>-<strong>A glossary</strong> to help readers with big words and water terminology</p>
<p>-A place for readers to <strong>add in their own water story</strong>!</p>
<p><strong>- </strong><strong>It's</strong><strong> waterless! </strong>Though it is filled with water stories, the book itself is printed through a waterless printing company (most print shops use a ton of water for printing! See more below**). It makes perfect sense to raise awareness of water consumption while being an environmentally-conscious gift.</p>

</div><p><strong>Note on waterless printing</strong>: Yes, it costs more, but it is the right - and environmentally conscious - thing to do. Many large presses can consume hundreds of thousands of litres of water per year as part of the normal printing process. Waterless printing takes advantage of modern technology to reduce these environmental impacts. It eliminates chemicals and water altogether. Waterless presses are also praised for their high-quality colour reproduction and the reduced paper set-up waste for each job.</p><p><strong>Note on Canada Post Strike: </strong>Please be aware that regional Canada Post strikes are happening in some Canadian cities.

Adventures with Watersnake - Exploring the Waterways of British Columbia shares eight adventurous water stories written by young British Columbian authors. Each story/chapter features real waterbodies and facts; some stories are fictional, and some are inspired by the author's own experiences and adventures! The seven authors are volunteer members of Waterlution's Youth Advisory Board.

Waterlution is a non-profit organization working to build future water leaders in Canada, and around the world. Annually, Waterlution trains and supports a nation-wide Youth Advisory Board comprised of young professionals and post-secondary students who are passionate about water and education! The Youth Advisory are champions of water and cultural education in their communities.
This campaign is so very important to the Youth Advisory Board, our dream is that Adventures with Watersnake inspires many to steward and protect our most precious resource, water!  All funds raised during this campaign will support educational workshops for school-aged youth in Canada. Please support our dream by helping us reach our goal!

What We Need & What You Get
To continue to reach more school groups in BC and across Canada, our Youth Advisors are working to raise $5000 that can help cover the costs associated with delivering workshops (For instance, some volunteers have to drive far distances to reach their schools, and some workshops require resource guests and/or materials).  Your contribution supports educational workshops for the Great Canoe Journey and Great Waters Challenge programs, delivered by the Youth Advisors and very knowledgeable resource guests.
Adventures with Watersnake includes:
- Eight stories (presented as chapters) tied together with Watersnake's narration
-A few black and white sketches in each chapter (as seen throughout this campaign!)
-Five printable colouring sheets of the sketches
-A glossary to help readers with big words and water terminology
-A place for readers to add in their own water story!
- It's waterless! Though it is filled with water stories, the book itself is printed through a waterless printing company (most print shops use a ton of water for printing! See more below**). It makes perfect sense to raise awareness of water consumption while being an environmentally-conscious gift.

The campaign also features:
- A culturally informative 2019 water calendar, with photos of waterbodies from across Canada and the traditional territories these waterbodies belong to. Each month you'll learn how to say ""water"" in a different indigenous language. Available in English and French, printed on eco-friendly paper (French version shipping the first week or Jan 2019).
- Copies of Canada's Great Water Adventure storybook (from 2017), inviting readers to explore Canada and its waterways through the eyes of two young adventurers set out to visit each province and territory to learn about many breathtaking and unique waterways. Available in English and French, printed by Warren's Waterless Printing.

The Team
Sarah Alexis, Author and Narrator -Sarah is a member of the Okanagan Indian Band located at the head of Okanagan Lake in British Columbia, Canada. She has an undergraduate degree in Indigenous Studies with a minor in History from the University of British Columbia Okanagan. Sarah continues to focus on her work involved in the Natural Resource sector and the Okanagan Language in the Syilx Nation. 
Kirsten Mathison, Author and Editor- An adventure enthusiast and life-long learner, Kirsten is passionate about exploration and discovery – whether in a cave, on a boat, up a mountain, or behind a computer screen. Exploring and learning more about the natural world led to a recognition of our profound interdependence and connection to the environment, including the omnipresent force and flow of water.  Kirsten has BSc in Geography and Anthropology from UVic and now works as a Geomatics Analyst, mapping the ocean floor and making navigation charts for submarines.
Emma Squires, Author and Editor-  Emma has always felt connected to and in awe of the natural world.  After earning her B’Comm from Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario, the draw of the ocean, glaciers and mountains of the West Coast led her to BC. Emma works in management consulting, and spends her free time exploring the backcountry of BC, by way of foot or boat through the summer, and by skis through the winter.
Jackson MacPherson, Author- Jackson is a  student studying water and environmental engineering technologies at the Okanagan College and eventually hopes to attend BCIT to obtain a full Bachelors of Technology. Ever since a young age, Jackson has been captivated with the role of water in society and within the ecosystem. 
Noa Mayer, Author- Noa is a student at the University of British Columbia pursuing a BSc in Natural Resource Conservation. Social and environmental stewardship were key ethics in Noa’s elementary education, focusing on our collective responsibility to protect and repair the planet. These ethics have stayed with Noa into her adult life and guide both her academic endeavours and personal ideologies. 
Cairo Huntingford, Author- Cairo is a Simon Fraser University History grad and future social studies teacher. An avid backpacker, Cairo has traveled through several countries in the world, and has big plans on traveling more of her own. If she could have it her own way, Cairo would be on the water all the time, whether it be while paddle-boarding or swimming on the vast ocean and lake bodies throughout her province.
Alan Shapiro, Author- Alan is an environmental professional and science communicator. He has consulted on a range of water resource projects, from environmental assessments to hydrogeological investigations, and has a particular interest is in water resource planning and stakeholder engagement. He is also co-founder of LitScience – a science communication training firm that supports academic, research, and technical organizations – and Science Slam Canada, a non-profit organization that runs science outreach events across the country.
Christine Craig, Water Calendar Coordinator- Christine completed the Ecosystem Management Technician program and the Advanced Water Systems Operations and Management program both completed at Sir Sandford Fleming College. She has been a water and wastewater treatment plant operator/mechanic with Ontario Clean Water Agency (OCWA) for the last 2 years. Christine teaches grade eight students about water and wastewater treatment processes giving students perspective on the importance of conserving/protecting our water for future generations.

The Impact
In the first two years of the Youth Advisory Board, 36 young leaders were trained and delivered educational workshops to over 4200 school-aged youth! As part of the program's design, many school classes hosted their own water celebrations, educating even more young minds!
The first self-published book by the Youth Advisory Board was released in Dec 2017 and has sold over 600 copies to date!
Your donations help bring more youth-led educational workshops to schools across Canada!

Note on waterless printing: Yes, it costs more, but it is the right - and environmentally conscious - thing to do. Many large presses can consume hundreds of thousands of litres of water per year as part of the normal printing process. Waterless printing takes advantage of modern technology to reduce these environmental impacts. It eliminates chemicals and water altogether. Waterless presses are also praised for their high-quality colour reproduction and the reduced paper set-up waste for each job.Note on Canada Post Strike: Please be aware that regional Canada Post strikes are happening in some Canadian cities.

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>For 10 år siden blev Alethkars konge myrdet under fejringen af en fredsaftale. </i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Nu er aletherne og parshenderne igen i krig, og hver dag falder tusinder på hver side. </i></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Kaladin har set overklassens bagside … </i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>… og mistet håbet. </i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I 2017 udkom <i>En konges vej del 1</i> og <i>2</i> som er den danske oversættelse af første bog i Brandon Sandersons episke fantasyserie Stormlysfortællingerne. Ulven og Uglen stod bag udgivelsen som på dansk spænder over 1.600 sider fordelt på to bøger og er oversat af erfarne Jakob Levinsen.  </p>
<p>Bøgerne er blevet modtaget rigtig godt, og mange har allerede spurgt hvornår fortsættelsen kommer. Målet er at det bliver i 2019, men vi er et lille forlag, og bøger af den størrelse koster en del at oversætte. Derfor har vi brug for din hjælp inden vi kan sætte Jakob ordentligt i gang.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>”Fantasy for voksne fra øverste hylde” </h3>
<p>Citatet ovenfor er skrevet af Arne Larsen, bibliotekar og anmelder på Litteratursiden.dk, som bare er en af mange glade læsere af første bind i Stormlysfortællingerne.  </p>
<p>Siden 2013 har Ulven og Uglen tilstræbt at udgive fantasy for voksne, både i form af originale danske titler og, ligesom med Stormlysfortællingerne, som oversat litteratur. Vi er et lille forlag med to ejere, et par praktikanter og flere freelancere tilknyttet. Vi er dedikerede nørder, og vi er ovenud begejstrede for at udgive en stor amerikansk forfatter som Brandon Sanderson. <i>En konges vej</i> har solgt godt og bragt glæde blandt læserne, men den har grundet sin størrelse været dyr at oversætte, og det samme er tilfældet med bog nummer to som på engelsk bærer titlen <i>Words of Radiance</i>, og som på dansk vil blive delt i tre bind a cirka 500 sider hver.  </p>
<p>Ulven og Uglen kunne vente på at <i>En konges vej</i> tjener sig ind, før vi igangsætter oversættelsen af bog 2, men så går der måske et år mere, og det synes vi er ærgerligt for alle dem der allerede har læst <i>En konges vej</i>, og som går og venter på fortsættelsen.  </p>
<p>Derfor vil vi gerne i gang med første tredjedel allerede nu, og vi giver dig derfor mulighed for at hjælpe os – og sikre dig et eksemplar før alle andre! </p>
<p>Du kan støtte med et valgfrit beløb, men hvis du støtter med bare 300 kr., så får du del 1 af Stormlysfortællingerne 2. Bogen vil efter udgivelsen blive solgt for 399 kr. så hvis du bestiller den allerede nu, er det godt for både dig og os.  </p>
<p>Hvis du ikke allerede har læst <i>En konges vej</i>, kan du støtte med 900 kr. og få dem også. De koster normalt 399 kr. per styk.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>”Dansk oversættelse på højt niveau” </h3>
<p>Sådan skrev bibliotekernes lektør om <i>En konges vej del 1</i>, og det er ikke underligt at hun var imponeret for Jakob Levinsen har en lang række oversættelser bag sig, inkluderende værker af bl.a. Mary Shelley, Kazuo Ishiguro, Stephen King, Salman Rushdie og J.R.R. Tolkien. Jakobs litterære spænd er bredt, men ligesom med resten af holdet hos Ulven og Uglen har fantasygenren en særlig plads i hans hjerte. </p>
<p>Derfor valgte vi ham til at oversætte Stormlysfortællingerne, og vi har ikke et øjeblik fortrudt vores valg. Jakob er loyal mod originalteksten, men også kreativ og formår at omgå udfordringerne i forskellene på engelsk og dansk således at teksten bevarer tonen og charmen selvom en passage ikke kan oversættes ordret. </p>
<p>Jakob har allerede oversat først kapitel af <i>Words of Radiance</i>, og uanset hvilket beløb du støtter med, så får du det tilsendt som pdf.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Risiko og udfordringer </h3>
<p>Som det altid er med crowdfunding så er der desværre ingen garanti for at vi når vores mål. Derfor er der heller ingen garanti for at oversættelsen udkommer, eller at den udkommer i januar 2019 som planlagt. Selvom vi ikke når målet for indsamlingen, vil vi selvfølgelig gøre vores bedste for at alle får de perks de har betalt for, dog med det forbehold at vi ikke kan sende bogen før vi har den. Hvis vi ikke når målet, kan oversættelsen komme til at tage længere tid end planlagt, eller vise sig helt umulig at gennemføre, og i det tilfælde får bidragyderen derfor ikke hele sin perk.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Bliv en del af Stormlysfortællingernes univers </h3>
<p>Hvis du støtter med 3.000 kr. eller derover, så kan du få en tegning af dig selv som en person fra bøgernes univers. Tegningerne laves af dygtige Thorkild Skov som har lavet forsiderne til <i>En konges vej del 1</i> og <i>2</i>, og som også kommer til at lave de næste forsider i serien.  </p>
<p>Du kan vælge mellem fem forskellige typer karakterer: </p>
<ul>
<li>Skårbærer </li>
<li>Forsker </li>
<li>Bromand </li>
<li>Snigmorder i Hvidt </li>
<li>Parshender </li>
</ul>
<p>Hvis du bestiller denne perk, kontakter vi dig for at få billeder og andre informationer så Thorkild kan gøre tegningen så livagtig som muligt. Du kan se et eksempel på en tegning i vores billedgalleri øverst på siden. Den forestiller Jakob Levinsen som Skårbærer. </p>

Selvom vi ikke når målet for indsamlingen, vil vi selvfølgelig gøre vores bedste for at alle får de perks de har betalt for, dog med det forbehold at vi ikke kan sende bogen før vi har den. Hvis vi ikke når målet, kan oversættelsen komme til at tage længere tid end planlagt, eller vise sig helt umulig at gennemføre, og i det tilfælde får bidragyderen derfor ikke hele sin perk.  
 
Bliv en del af Stormlysfortællingernes univers 
Hvis du støtter med 3.000 kr. eller derover, så kan du få en tegning af dig selv som en person fra bøgernes univers. Tegningerne laves af dygtige Thorkild Skov som har lavet forsiderne til En konges vej del 1 og 2, og som også kommer til at lave de næste forsider i serien.  
Du kan vælge mellem fem forskellige typer karakterer: 

Skårbærer 
Forsker 
Bromand 
Snigmorder i Hvidt 
Parshender 

Hvis du bestiller denne perk, kontakter vi dig for at få billeder og andre informationer så Thorkild kan gøre tegningen så livagtig som muligt. Du kan se et eksempel på en tegning i vores billedgalleri øverst på siden. Den forestiller Jakob Levinsen som Skårbærer.

For The Planet - For The Animals - For Ourselves

Global Warming: The U.N. believes that a global shift toward plant-based food is vital if we are to combat the worst effects of climate change. A report published by the Worldwatch Institute shows that a staggering 51 percent or more of global greenhouse-gas emissions are caused by animal agriculture. 

Animal Rights: Being vegan is about living a lifestyle that does not cause suffering, harm or death to animals, and allowing animals to be free to choose the way they want to live. Other animals are sentient beings like us, with their own needs, desires and interests. We now know that like us, they can experience a wide range of sensations and emotions such as happiness, pain, pleasure, fear, hunger, sadness, boredom, frustration or contentment. 

Serious Diseases: Animal fats have been linked to a range of illnesses and conditions, including diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, heart disease, and various cancers. Animal sources are likely to account for 13 of the top 15 sources of cholesterol-raising fats in the U.S.

 WITH YOUR HELP AND CONTRIBUTION WE CAN MAKE THIS WORLD A BETTER PLACE FOR ALL OF US.
 

From Our Heart
We dream of living in a world where all animals are treated with respect, love and compassion. All of us at USA Vegan Magazine are devoted to this project, we have made many sacrifices, not only financially but personally as well. We've come a long way and we are all very proud of what we've accomplished so far. Now more than ever we are certain that our magazine will become the #1 publication of its type and will be at the forefront of veganism.

What We Need & What You Get 

This IndieGoGo campaign was initiated by my friends in
Corporate America who saw the passion dedicated towards this project. A few weeks ago, I made the decision to leave an established career to focus on
building this work. 
The work will go beyond the book. As I conduct research, I
will record the interviews on film and produce a documentary to help spread
awareness of the conditions that are exposed throughout this journey of
research, asking questions and building relationships.
Where Lost Dreams Go
will begin a conversation within underprivileged communities, families and
schools. This is not just a book, this is a movement.  
Donations will go towards: 
· 
The cost of conducting interviews, travelling,
and other related expenses 
· 
The cost of producing a documentary and
submitting it to film festivals
· 
The cost of publishing the books
I am writing this from an intense desire to reach the community
where I was born and bridge the gap from the struggle to the dream. 
As a supporter of this campaign, you will get the first word about the interviews, the stories, and the impact of this movement to make even the most unlikely dreams come true.

<p>Don’t leave writers high and dry! The book is written, but it still needs to be published. </p>
<p>Barbara Turner-Vesselago’s first book, <i>Writing Without a Parachute,</i> showed writers how to fall in love with writing. <i>Freefall into Fiction </i> shows them how to write fiction and memoir (without falling out of love). But her publisher has unexpectedly closed its doors.  </p>
<p>Barbara teaches <a href=""http://freefallwriting.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Freefall Writing™</a> Workshops privately and through universities in Canada, the US, England and Australia. She is a writer and an editor, with a doctorate from the University of Cambridge. Barbara has
published 3 books and many shorter pieces (fiction, memoir and non-fiction). </p>
<p>Barbara’s first book about writing, <i>Writing Without a Parachute: The Art of Freefall</i>, published in the UK by Vala (2013) and in Australia by Finch (2014) was widely acclaimed.</p>
<blockquote>“I used to have two shelves of books on writing,” wrote one bookseller, “Now I only stock this one.” </blockquote><blockquote>From reviewers: ""I'm on fire!"" ""An absolute lifesaver"" ""Do Freefall!""</blockquote>
<p><i>Freefall into Fiction</i>, designed to take this process to the next stage, was scheduled for publication this year. But Vala is closing shop -- and writers need this book now. </p>
<p>This campaign will bring <i>Freefall into Fiction</i> to market, funding the pre-production, production and marketing costs so that writers around the world can write the books they’ve always wanted to write. </p><p><b style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;""><br/></b></p><p><b style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">What we need, and what we would like to offer you</b></p>

Freefall into Fiction  is for writers who have found their voice, and now want to write fiction or memoir. Funding will bring this book through pre-production. 
Don’t leave writers high and dry! The book is written, but it still needs to be published. 
Barbara Turner-Vesselago’s first book, Writing Without a Parachute, showed writers how to fall in love with writing. Freefall into Fiction  shows them how to write fiction and memoir (without falling out of love). But her publisher has unexpectedly closed its doors.  
Barbara teaches Freefall Writing™ Workshops privately and through universities in Canada, the US, England and Australia. She is a writer and an editor, with a doctorate from the University of Cambridge. Barbara has
published 3 books and many shorter pieces (fiction, memoir and non-fiction). 
Barbara’s first book about writing, Writing Without a Parachute: The Art of Freefall, published in the UK by Vala (2013) and in Australia by Finch (2014) was widely acclaimed.
“I used to have two shelves of books on writing,” wrote one bookseller, “Now I only stock this one.” From reviewers: ""I'm on fire!"" ""An absolute lifesaver"" ""Do Freefall!""
Freefall into Fiction, designed to take this process to the next stage, was scheduled for publication this year. But Vala is closing shop -- and writers need this book now. 
This campaign will bring Freefall into Fiction to market, funding the pre-production, production and marketing costs so that writers around the world can write the books they’ve always wanted to write. What we need, and what we would like to offer you
The book is written and ready for pre-production. The funding is to take the book through the editing process, to print, and to market. To do this, we are seeking a total of CAD $14,756, which will fund:
Pre-publication costs:  $6,880
Initial Printing of 300 copies in UK, and 300 in CAN/US:  $2,896 
Marketing in UK, Australia, Canada and US: $5,000

Every dollar will help bring this book out sooner. We are grateful for all contributions, and are offering the following:
$50 contribution:  our personal thanks to you as a Supporter and an on-demand copy of Freefall into Fiction  
$200 contribution:  a pre-publication copy of the book posted to you and  special mention on the FreefallWriting.com website as a Silver Supporter
$500 contribution:  your name in print as a Gold Supporter in Freefall into Fiction, a pre-publication copy of which will be posted to you, plus special mention on the FreefallWriting.com website 

To Freefall Patrons and Founders we offer the following:

<h2><b>WHAT MARK NEEDS TO PUBLISH AND PROMOTE THIS BOOK</b></h2>
<h3><b>Budget </b></h3>
<h4><b>(Full details are below, before the FAQS section)</b></h4>
<p><b></b>
</p><h4><b>Minimum Goal: $7,000 to publish &amp; distribute the book</b></h4>
<ul>
<li>This is the goal we’re currently working on</li>
</ul>
<p><b></b>
</p><h4><b>Hope Goal: $12,000 total to publish and promote the book so people will know it exists</b></h4>
<ul>
<li>Includes the $7,000 to publish &amp; distribute the book PLUS an additional $5,000 to promote the book to pastors, churches, bookstores, etc.<b></b>
</li>
<li>Without promotional marketing, the typical book only sells about 100 copies.<b></b>
</li>
<li>While Mark trusts God to promote the book, God will need to help Mark purchase copies of the book to give to key people. God may be wanting you to contribute the money to help publish and promote the book.
</li>
</ul>
<h4><b>Dream Goal: $17,000 total to publish and promote the book, and for living expenses to allow Mark to devote time to jump start promotion of his missionary work and book</b></h4>
<ul>
<li><b>This is the amount Mark is asking God for</b></li>
<li>Includes the $7,000 to publish &amp; distribute the book, $5,000 to promote the book, PLUS an additional $5,000 for Mark’s living expenses.<b></b>
</li>
<li>Without a source of income to support ministry and book promotion, Mark will only be able to share his missionary work and market the book very part-time, while he earns a living through his life coaching. Having limited time to promote the book may put its success in jeopardy.</li>
<li>While Mark’s missionary and the book’s successes are ultimately in God’s hands, God will need to provide Mark with income to support his work; you may be one of the people God wants to contribute to Mark’s missionary work to reverse church decline and transform lives.</li>
</ul>
<p>Like most first-time authors, traditional publishing companies and literary agents aren’t interested in talking with Mark, so he must self-publish this book. Traditional publishing companies only accept manuscripts from literary agents. 
</p><p>Mark contacted numerous agents to obtain representation, but none were interested, with two explaining that the large costs incurred to publish and promote books causes publishing houses to refrain from taking risks on most first-time authors.</p><p><br/></p>

<br/>
<h2><b>ADVISORY TEAM OVERSIGHT</b></h2>
<p>Mark has an Advisory Team that provides counsel, oversight and accountability to Mark’s ministry. They are not a legally invested group, as Mark’s self-employed ministry is not incorporated. But Mark makes himself voluntarily accountable to them. All of these professionals have known Mark for over 10 years, and two for over 20 years.

areas.  <br/></p>While there is no specific expiration date for the coaching and training hours, practically speaking, they must be 
scheduled with Mark prior to his retirement from coaching sometime in 
the future (he has no plans for retiring at this time, but because we 
never know when health problems or accidents may interrupt our work 
life, it would be wise to schedule with Mark in a timely manner). There 
will be no refunds for unused hours upon his retirement. In other words, consider scheduling coaching or training with Mark in 2016.<br/><br/><h4>5.  Name your own perk for contributions of $2,500 or more<br/>
</h4>
<p>Contributors of amounts of $2,500 or more may discuss with Mark how they would like to receive their books or coaching or training.</p>
<p>Restrictions regarding the above perks may still apply. At this contribution level, paperback books may be able to be shipped overseas, though high shipping fees may limit the number of books that can be ordered, especially for international shipments. NOTE: The paperback book cannot be shipped to countries to which the U.S. prohibits exports.</p>

<h2><b>22 FAQS</b></h2>
<p><b>What's the book about?</b>
</p><p><i>Driving Through Heaven</i> will teach you how to live the way God designed us to live in order to experience the Abundant Life that Jesus promised us. It is the most comprehensive how-to book on Christian Living ever published. It is based on the premise that if we could go to heaven and see how they live there, then we could live that way on earth.
</p><p>The good news is that God teaches us in the New Testament how to live like they do in heaven. Because life here is not perfect like heaven, we still have stress and pain, but God has given us all of the spiritual blessings of heaven to enjoy now through a relationship with Jesus Christ (Ephesians 1:3).
</p><p>Applying God's principles and skills to life can greatly reduce earthly suffering, and increase our experience of the fruit of God's Spirit: love, joy, peace, patience, rest, etc. (see Galatians 5:22-23 for the full list). For more about the book, visit the book website at <b><a href=""http://drivingthroughheaven.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">DrivingThroughHeaven.com</a>.</b>
</p>
<p><b>Why did Mark write it?</b>
</p><p>Mark's answer: ""The original reason was that I was searching for a way to help my clients more quickly learn what they needed. But I couldn't find a book to give my clients that included all of God's New Testament principles and skills for living, which is what I was teaching them. So God told me to write it. Many excellent books on Christian living are based on just one area of God's design for living, like prayer, communications, or dealing with depression.  I've concisely included in one guidebook everything that you need to know to experience more of God in your life and more of the fruit of his Holy Spirit.""
</p><p>""The second reason is that the lack of skills training in churches means that Christ followers do not have the skills to reach out to the unchurched, invite them to become part of God's family, and train them to follow Jesus.  This lack of skills training is the primary cause for the closing of 7,000 churches annually in the U.S, and why researcher George Barna reported that only 1% of Americans experience the most fulfilling life God offers.""
</p>
<p><b>What topics are included?</b>
</p><p>The book is divided into seven parts: you can live in God’s kingdom on earth and experience the Abundant Life Jesus promised, on part on each of the five dimensions of life (spiritual, intellectual, emotional, relational, and physical), how to integrate life, and how to live life to the fullest. The actual <i>Table of Contents</i> from the book is included at the book website on the <a href=""http://drivingthroughheaven.com/?page_id=185"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b></b></a><a href=""http://drivingthroughheaven.com/?page_id=185"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sample Chapters page</a>.
</p>
<p><b>Can I read some sample chapters?</b>
</p><p>Sure. Several sample chapters are included at the book website on the <a href=""http://drivingthroughheaven.com/?page_id=185"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sample Chapters page</a>, including the <i>Introduction</i>, titled <i>What You Will Learn</i>.
</p>
<p><b>When will the book be published?</b>
</p><p>Mark will independently publish <i>Driving Through Heaven</i>. First, Mark must raise the funds to hire a company to design and publish the book in paperback and digital (e-book) formats. Once the minimum amount of $7,000 is raised, it will be 4-6 months until you can buy a copy. 
</p><p>But those who financially partner with Mark to make this book available, will receive a free copy of the book.  Mark hopes the book will be available in both formats by May 1, 2016.
</p>
<p><b>How many pages will it have?</b>
</p><p>The manuscript has 451 pages, but the actual count for the print editions won't be known until after the interior is designed and ""typeset."" We're guessing the paperback edition will be about 370 pages, but this answer will be updated as soon as we know, later this fall. <br/></p><p><b>Will it include questions for discussion?</b></p><p>Each chapter ends with Questions for Meditation or Discussion.<br/></p>
<p><b>How long did it take Mark to write it?</b>
</p><p>In December, 1995, God called Mark to write the book, and he began work shortly thereafter, but it wasn’t until 2000 that he produced the first three chapters of the first of three major drafts. He worked on and off on it after that until 2010, when he began the 2<sup>nd</sup> draft and completed it one year later. 
</p><p>Changes in the way people prefer to read books, led to a major revision as the 3<sup>rd</sup> draft, which was completed with the help of a couple of professional editors early in 2015. After a break of several months to create the book website, Mark began proofreading this past summer, with the help of two proofreaders.
</p><p>All together, he estimates he has devoted over 2,000 hours to the writing project, and many more to the website and the fundraising campaign.
</p><p><b>In what formats will the book be published?</b>
</p><p>The book will be released in paperback and digital (e-book) editions.  Hardcovers require a different printing process from paperbacks and expensive warehouse storage of copies, so hardcovers will not be available at this time.
</p>
<p><b>How many copies will be printed?</b>
</p><p>Individual copies will be printed when ordered. This ""print on demand"" method reduces the cost of publishing, so that Mark doesn't have to pay to store a lot of copies in a warehouse. Whenever you order a book from a retailer, a copy will be specially printed for you at the printing company, and usually shipped within one day.
</p><p>If you would like to own copies of the first-run edition of the paperback, you need to pre-order copies during this campaign. First run copies will not be available after the 40-day campaign ends! <br/></p><p><b>Why would I buy a book I haven't seen?</b></p><p>We don't expect you to! At the book website, <a href=""http://drivingthroughheaven.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">DrivingThroughHeaven.com</a>, you can read everything you would if you were holding a copy in your hand or ""looking inside"" at Amazon.com:</p><ul>
<li>Read the same information you would find on the back cover</li>
<li>See endorsements for the book (they're also on this page)</li>
<li>Read the Table of Contents, Introduction, and 7 full chapters.</li>
</ul><p>Plus, you can ask the author questions about the book using the forms at the bottom of the book website home page, or through the contact information at this site.<br/></p><p></p><p><b>Are contributions tax-deductible?</b>
</p><p>Sorry, no. Mark’s ministry is not an incorporated non-profit, and therefore does not qualify for tax-deductible contributions. The process to obtain non-profit status is complicated, expensive (legal and filing fees), and requires the ability to prove the way contributions are spent over a period of time. God has never led Mark to raise the hundreds of dollars required to incorporate at all, including as a not-for-profit organization. <br/></p><p><b>If I change my mind, can I upgrade to a different perk after I've already contributed?</b></p><p>Sure. Log in to your Indiegogo account and click to view your perk order. Select the perk you originally chose, then click ""Upgrade"" to select a new one.<br/></p><p><b>Will this Indiegogo site be available for contributions after the campaign ends on Nov. 25, 2015?</b></p><p>If the Minimum Goal of $7,000 is <i>not</i> reached by Nov. 25, then the site will no longer accept contributions. However, if the Minimum Goal is reached, then the site will continue to be open. Please help us reach that goal by contributing today.<br/></p>
<p><b>What if the minimum goal is not reached? Will I still get my books?</b>
</p><p>All books and coaching hours pre-ordered will be delivered as soon as possible after publication.
</p><p>We believe that God will raise the money needed to publish the book he told Mark to write, and that if those funds do not come through this campaign, that he will be provide them through other sources. Mark and Christie have funds saved for their retirement that God may ask them to use if needed.
</p>
<p><b>What if there’s money left over after publishing? Or,what if more than the minimum amount of $7,000 is raised?</b>
</p><p>Any funds remaining after the book is published will be used for promoting the book to pastors, churches, and readers so that book can become known. This marketing work will include purchasing paperback copies to send to people in positions to be able to recommend to others that they buy the book.
</p><p>If Mark’s Hope Goal of $12,000 is reached, some of the funds will be used for Mark to travel in the U.S. on book tours to promote the book.
</p><p>Any funds raised toward the Dream Goal of $17,000 (above the $12,000 Hope Goal) <i>will</i> be used for living expenses so that Mark can devote more time to book promotion. 
</p>
<p><b>Will any of the money raised be used by Mark for living expenses?</b>
</p><p><i>All </i>funds contributed toward the minimum goal of $7,000 will be used to purchase the services to publish the book and get it into distribution to online and physical bookstores. Above the minimum goal, all money contributed toward Mark’s Hope Goal of $12,000 will go toward promoting the book so that as many people as possible may hear about it. 
</p><p>Only if contributions exceed $12,000, will any funds be used for living expenses, which will allow Mark to devote more time to book promotion and sharing his disciple making mission work with others. 
</p><p><b>Has Mark contributed any of his own money to this project?</b>
</p><p>Yes. He spent about $2,500 to pay professional editors and over $100 for printer paper and ink. He will continue to support this project, as God directs, to help see that it succeeds.<br/></p><p><b>Won’t Mark receive royalties from books he sells once it’s published?</b>
</p><p>Mark does not expect to receive any personal income from book sales for the first year, or more.
</p><p>Income from book sales must exceed publishing and promotion costs for Mark to receive any personal income, which would then be applied to the professional costs of his self-employed ministry. Only when total income from his ministry, including book sales, exceeds his ministry expenses, will Mark benefit from book sales.
</p><p>To keep the book available for printing and distribution requires annual fees of about $500, plus the annual costs associated with bookstores returning unsold paperbacks of at least $199. These costs must be deducted from the estimated gross profit of $2.50 per paperback sold.
</p><p>Fortunately, the royalties from digital book sales are higher, with lower annual costs, so that e-book sales will help subsidize keeping the paperback version available. However, the typical book without promotion marketing sells less than 100 copies! So, Mark will need to devote time and approximately $5,000 per year to promotion just to cover the annual publishing expenses.
</p><p>Therefore, Mark will need to sell about 1,340 books per year to cover his costs (i.e., break even). This is why the Hope Goal of $12,000 is so important, because it will provide Mark with $5,000 above the publishing expenses to jump start book promotion to the pastors, churches, and people, like you, who will benefit from this amazing handbook of Christian living.
</p><p><b>Where will I be able to purchase copies?</b>
</p><p>During this fundraising project to publish the book, copies of the book are available to pre-order, allowing you to be among the first to own <i>Driving Through Heaven</i>. After the book is released, online retailers like Christian Book Distributors, Amazon, Barnes &amp; Noble, and others will carry both editions. Bookstores everywhere will be able to order paperback copies on request.
</p><p><b>How much will the book cost once it's published?</b>
</p><p>The final cost is not yet set, but is expected to be around $19.97 for the approximately 370 page paperback and $9.99 for the e-book. We'll update this answer as soon as we know, later this fall or early winter.

ABOUT THE AUTHOR


Mark Gardner, M.Min., founder of Gardner Coaching in 2005, has done counseling and personal life skills coaching for over 35 years. He is an expert disciple maker who empowers people to experience the Abundant Life Jesus promised, and he trains pastors and churches with the skills to use Jesus' disciple making method to transform and grow their churches.
Mark has worked one-on-one with over 3,000 people and taught seminars and workshops on more than 100 topics related to Christian living and life in God's church family. He has a B.A. in psychology and a masters in ministry.  Mark is married, has two daughters, and lives in a small town near Dayton, Ohio. 







WHAT MARK NEEDS TO PUBLISH AND PROMOTE THIS BOOK
Budget 
(Full details are below, before the FAQS section)

Minimum Goal: $7,000 to publish & distribute the book

This is the goal we’re currently working on


Hope Goal: $12,000 total to publish and promote the book so people will know it exists

Includes the $7,000 to publish & distribute the book PLUS an additional $5,000 to promote the book to pastors, churches, bookstores, etc.

Without promotional marketing, the typical book only sells about 100 copies.

While Mark trusts God to promote the book, God will need to help Mark purchase copies of the book to give to key people. God may be wanting you to contribute the money to help publish and promote the book.


Dream Goal: $17,000 total to publish and promote the book, and for living expenses to allow Mark to devote time to jump start promotion of his missionary work and book

This is the amount Mark is asking God for
Includes the $7,000 to publish & distribute the book, $5,000 to promote the book, PLUS an additional $5,000 for Mark’s living expenses.

Without a source of income to support ministry and book promotion, Mark will only be able to share his missionary work and market the book very part-time, while he earns a living through his life coaching. Having limited time to promote the book may put its success in jeopardy.
While Mark’s missionary and the book’s successes are ultimately in God’s hands, God will need to provide Mark with income to support his work; you may be one of the people God wants to contribute to Mark’s missionary work to reverse church decline and transform lives.

Like most first-time authors, traditional publishing companies and literary agents aren’t interested in talking with Mark, so he must self-publish this book. Traditional publishing companies only accept manuscripts from literary agents. 
Mark contacted numerous agents to obtain representation, but none were interested, with two explaining that the large costs incurred to publish and promote books causes publishing houses to refrain from taking risks on most first-time authors.


ADVISORY TEAM OVERSIGHT
Mark has an Advisory Team that provides counsel, oversight and accountability to Mark’s ministry. They are not a legally invested group, as Mark’s self-employed ministry is not incorporated. But Mark makes himself voluntarily accountable to them. All of these professionals have known Mark for over 10 years, and two for over 20 years.

HOW TO CONTRIBUTE AND PERKS FOR DOING IT
Please help Mark to make this valuable book available to as many people and churches as possible.
If everyone Mark knows pre-orders at least one paperback with a $25 contribution, we will easily make the $7,000 minimum goal. If everyone orders two copies with a $50 contribution we'll easily reach the $12,000 Hope Goal. If we can raise that amount, we’ll have funds to promote the book to make pastors and people aware of it. Please consider ordering at least two paperbacks or giving at least $50.
Pre-Order Books and Contribute to the Book’s Success

You can make contributions in any amount, and if you choose, depending on the level of your support, Mark will provide you with digital or paperback copies of the book, and free life skills coaching for you or your church.
Examples:

Contribute $15, and Mark will send you a copy of the PDF version of the book.
Contribute $25, and you will receive one signed paperback copy.
For $110, he’ll provide you with one hour of coaching you can use, give to a family member or friend, or have him do training for your church or organization. 
For $1,000, you’ll receive 5 paperback books plus 10 hours of coaching or training. 

Anyone who contributes any amount will be listed on the Thank You Page of the book website.

Thanks in advance for considering this opportunity to transform lives and churches

PERKS YOU CAN RECEIVE OR GIVE TO OTHERS

1.  Name listed in the book as a project partner, and on a Thank You Page on the book website, DrivingThroughHeaven.com for every contribution.
2. Everyone who contributes will receive 30-minutes of free Christian life skills coaching by phone or in Mark's Eaton, Ohio office.

2.  Copies of the PDF version

This will be the complete book, the same as the e-books and paperback versions. 
They will be sent to you via email as soon as it has been formatted, sometime in late 2015 or early 2016. 
We regret that distribution complexity of e-books prohibits Mark from making Kindle, Nook, and similar editions available.

3.  Author-signed copies of the paperback

Mark will hold several special Paperback Book Launch events in Preble County, Ohio soon as he receives the first run from the printer, approximately May 1, 2016.
Anyone living in the Preble County, Ohio area who is unable to attend will have their books delivered to them to reduce shipping costs.
Everyone else in the U.S. will receive their copies by U.S. Postal Service delivery as soon as possible after the books are received.
Pre-publication orders of the book are only available to be shipped inside the United States due to the high cost of international shipping.  The book will be available through retail outlets about May 1, 2016.


4.  Hours of Christian life skills coaching or training for your church or organization
Benefit from Mark’s 35 years of experience helping 3,000 people to improve their lives, pastoring 5 churches; over 12 years serving as an inner-city social worker, psychotherapist, and addictions counselor; and master Christian life skills coach, trainer, and expert disciple maker since 2005. He holds a Bachelors degree in Psychology and Masters in Ministry. 

Coaching for individuals, couples, and families in all areas of Christian living: know God better and his will for your life, overcome problems, improve relationships, learn how to have God’s healing, receive help with making decisions like career changes

Coaching for churches and organizations: clarify your mission and God’s vision for your future, identify challenges and opportunities, develop a strategic plan for success, determine what training and other resources are needed to grow and excel

Training for churches and organizations. Mark has created and presented over 100 public seminars and workshops on topics related to Christian living and church life. He specializes in training pastors and churches to use Jesus’ disciplemaking method, but can provide customized training according to your needs.


Coaching and training may be scheduled directly with Mark beginning 
in 
December, 2015. Coaching for individuals, couples, and families will be 
provided in-person in Mark's Eaton, Ohio office or by phone from 
anywhere in the world, at the client's expense for the call. Church and 
organizational coaching or training will be provided in-person within 3 
hours of Eaton, OH, and by Skype or other Internet service for all other 
areas.  While there is no specific expiration date for the coaching and training hours, practically speaking, they must be 
scheduled with Mark prior to his retirement from coaching sometime in 
the future (he has no plans for retiring at this time, but because we 
never know when health problems or accidents may interrupt our work 
life, it would be wise to schedule with Mark in a timely manner). There 
will be no refunds for unused hours upon his retirement. In other words, consider scheduling coaching or training with Mark in 2016.5.  Name your own perk for contributions of $2,500 or more

Contributors of amounts of $2,500 or more may discuss with Mark how they would like to receive their books or coaching or training.
Restrictions regarding the above perks may still apply. At this contribution level, paperback books may be able to be shipped overseas, though high shipping fees may limit the number of books that can be ordered, especially for international shipments. NOTE: The paperback book cannot be shipped to countries to which the U.S. prohibits exports.

22 FAQS
What's the book about?
Driving Through Heaven will teach you how to live the way God designed us to live in order to experience the Abundant Life that Jesus promised us. It is the most comprehensive how-to book on Christian Living ever published. It is based on the premise that if we could go to heaven and see how they live there, then we could live that way on earth.
The good news is that God teaches us in the New Testament how to live like they do in heaven. Because life here is not perfect like heaven, we still have stress and pain, but God has given us all of the spiritual blessings of heaven to enjoy now through a relationship with Jesus Christ (Ephesians 1:3).
Applying God's principles and skills to life can greatly reduce earthly suffering, and increase our experience of the fruit of God's Spirit: love, joy, peace, patience, rest, etc. (see Galatians 5:22-23 for the full list). For more about the book, visit the book website at DrivingThroughHeaven.com.

Why did Mark write it?
Mark's answer: ""The original reason was that I was searching for a way to help my clients more quickly learn what they needed. But I couldn't find a book to give my clients that included all of God's New Testament principles and skills for living, which is what I was teaching them. So God told me to write it. Many excellent books on Christian living are based on just one area of God's design for living, like prayer, communications, or dealing with depression.  I've concisely included in one guidebook everything that you need to know to experience more of God in your life and more of the fruit of his Holy Spirit.""
""The second reason is that the lack of skills training in churches means that Christ followers do not have the skills to reach out to the unchurched, invite them to become part of God's family, and train them to follow Jesus.  This lack of skills training is the primary cause for the closing of 7,000 churches annually in the U.S, and why researcher George Barna reported that only 1% of Americans experience the most fulfilling life God offers.""

What topics are included?
The book is divided into seven parts: you can live in God’s kingdom on earth and experience the Abundant Life Jesus promised, on part on each of the five dimensions of life (spiritual, intellectual, emotional, relational, and physical), how to integrate life, and how to live life to the fullest. The actual Table of Contents from the book is included at the book website on the Sample Chapters page.

Can I read some sample chapters?
Sure. Several sample chapters are included at the book website on the Sample Chapters page, including the Introduction, titled What You Will Learn.

When will the book be published?
Mark will independently publish Driving Through Heaven. First, Mark must raise the funds to hire a company to design and publish the book in paperback and digital (e-book) formats. Once the minimum amount of $7,000 is raised, it will be 4-6 months until you can buy a copy. 
But those who financially partner with Mark to make this book available, will receive a free copy of the book.  Mark hopes the book will be available in both formats by May 1, 2016.

How many pages will it have?
The manuscript has 451 pages, but the actual count for the print editions won't be known until after the interior is designed and ""typeset."" We're guessing the paperback edition will be about 370 pages, but this answer will be updated as soon as we know, later this fall. Will it include questions for discussion?Each chapter ends with Questions for Meditation or Discussion.
How long did it take Mark to write it?
In December, 1995, God called Mark to write the book, and he began work shortly thereafter, but it wasn’t until 2000 that he produced the first three chapters of the first of three major drafts. He worked on and off on it after that until 2010, when he began the 2nd draft and completed it one year later. 
Changes in the way people prefer to read books, led to a major revision as the 3rd draft, which was completed with the help of a couple of professional editors early in 2015. After a break of several months to create the book website, Mark began proofreading this past summer, with the help of two proofreaders.
All together, he estimates he has devoted over 2,000 hours to the writing project, and many more to the website and the fundraising campaign.
In what formats will the book be published?
The book will be released in paperback and digital (e-book) editions.  Hardcovers require a different printing process from paperbacks and expensive warehouse storage of copies, so hardcovers will not be available at this time.

How many copies will be printed?
Individual copies will be printed when ordered. This ""print on demand"" method reduces the cost of publishing, so that Mark doesn't have to pay to store a lot of copies in a warehouse. Whenever you order a book from a retailer, a copy will be specially printed for you at the printing company, and usually shipped within one day.
If you would like to own copies of the first-run edition of the paperback, you need to pre-order copies during this campaign. First run copies will not be available after the 40-day campaign ends! Why would I buy a book I haven't seen?We don't expect you to! At the book website, DrivingThroughHeaven.com, you can read everything you would if you were holding a copy in your hand or ""looking inside"" at Amazon.com:
Read the same information you would find on the back cover
See endorsements for the book (they're also on this page)
Read the Table of Contents, Introduction, and 7 full chapters.
Plus, you can ask the author questions about the book using the forms at the bottom of the book website home page, or through the contact information at this site.Are contributions tax-deductible?
Sorry, no. Mark’s ministry is not an incorporated non-profit, and therefore does not qualify for tax-deductible contributions. The process to obtain non-profit status is complicated, expensive (legal and filing fees), and requires the ability to prove the way contributions are spent over a period of time. God has never led Mark to raise the hundreds of dollars required to incorporate at all, including as a not-for-profit organization. If I change my mind, can I upgrade to a different perk after I've already contributed?Sure. Log in to your Indiegogo account and click to view your perk order. Select the perk you originally chose, then click ""Upgrade"" to select a new one.Will this Indiegogo site be available for contributions after the campaign ends on Nov. 25, 2015?If the Minimum Goal of $7,000 is not reached by Nov. 25, then the site will no longer accept contributions. However, if the Minimum Goal is reached, then the site will continue to be open. Please help us reach that goal by contributing today.
What if the minimum goal is not reached? Will I still get my books?
All books and coaching hours pre-ordered will be delivered as soon as possible after publication.
We believe that God will raise the money needed to publish the book he told Mark to write, and that if those funds do not come through this campaign, that he will be provide them through other sources. Mark and Christie have funds saved for their retirement that God may ask them to use if needed.

What if there’s money left over after publishing? Or,what if more than the minimum amount of $7,000 is raised?
Any funds remaining after the book is published will be used for promoting the book to pastors, churches, and readers so that book can become known. This marketing work will include purchasing paperback copies to send to people in positions to be able to recommend to others that they buy the book.
If Mark’s Hope Goal of $12,000 is reached, some of the funds will be used for Mark to travel in the U.S. on book tours to promote the book.
Any funds raised toward the Dream Goal of $17,000 (above the $12,000 Hope Goal) will be used for living expenses so that Mark can devote more time to book promotion. 

Will any of the money raised be used by Mark for living expenses?
All funds contributed toward the minimum goal of $7,000 will be used to purchase the services to publish the book and get it into distribution to online and physical bookstores. Above the minimum goal, all money contributed toward Mark’s Hope Goal of $12,000 will go toward promoting the book so that as many people as possible may hear about it. 
Only if contributions exceed $12,000, will any funds be used for living expenses, which will allow Mark to devote more time to book promotion and sharing his disciple making mission work with others. 
Has Mark contributed any of his own money to this project?
Yes. He spent about $2,500 to pay professional editors and over $100 for printer paper and ink. He will continue to support this project, as God directs, to help see that it succeeds.Won’t Mark receive royalties from books he sells once it’s published?
Mark does not expect to receive any personal income from book sales for the first year, or more.
Income from book sales must exceed publishing and promotion costs for Mark to receive any personal income, which would then be applied to the professional costs of his self-employed ministry. Only when total income from his ministry, including book sales, exceeds his ministry expenses, will Mark benefit from book sales.
To keep the book available for printing and distribution requires annual fees of about $500, plus the annual costs associated with bookstores returning unsold paperbacks of at least $199. These costs must be deducted from the estimated gross profit of $2.50 per paperback sold.
Fortunately, the royalties from digital book sales are higher, with lower annual costs, so that e-book sales will help subsidize keeping the paperback version available. However, the typical book without promotion marketing sells less than 100 copies! So, Mark will need to devote time and approximately $5,000 per year to promotion just to cover the annual publishing expenses.
Therefore, Mark will need to sell about 1,340 books per year to cover his costs (i.e., break even). This is why the Hope Goal of $12,000 is so important, because it will provide Mark with $5,000 above the publishing expenses to jump start book promotion to the pastors, churches, and people, like you, who will benefit from this amazing handbook of Christian living.
Where will I be able to purchase copies?
During this fundraising project to publish the book, copies of the book are available to pre-order, allowing you to be among the first to own Driving Through Heaven. After the book is released, online retailers like Christian Book Distributors, Amazon, Barnes & Noble, and others will carry both editions. Bookstores everywhere will be able to order paperback copies on request.
How much will the book cost once it's published?
The final cost is not yet set, but is expected to be around $19.97 for the approximately 370 page paperback and $9.99 for the e-book. We'll update this answer as soon as we know, later this fall or early winter.

  If you have a question for Mark, please contact him. You’ll receive a personal reply and your question may be added to this list.

Designed to question nearly half our Bill of Rights, JKAT is a bold daring book that challenges our freedom to write what we choose in a way that these constitutional rights may not have be contested since the days of Lenny Bruce. Vulgar, bold, opinionated and at times offensive, this book may set forth a new wave of American authors.
    Other Ways You Can Help Please share and advertise this message as well as links to the book JKAT on your social media and web pages, so that a true American message in this word can get out there!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><strong>Fantasy, but Everywhere</strong></h3>
<p>Hey! I'm Elle, a genre-defying writer who loves finding unique ideas and turning them into fantasy worlds. I'm so excited to bring you my first book.</p>
<p><i>Seastrider</i> is a Frankenstein of genres: gothic horror, coming-of-age fantasy, literary fiction. Literature readers love it. Fantasy readers are intrigued by its unique style. It's unlike anything you've read before.</p>
<p>That's exactly what my writing is: Fantasy, but everywhere.</p>

<p>Here's the summary:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i><strong>A footprint on a Sea. A curse, a devil, and an apocalypse. A queen who does not know she is a queen—or a warrior.</strong></i></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">She begins as a frayling—a creature torn from life itself by grief and guilt.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Her relentless, desperate quest to find the soul of a forgotten Starchild thrusts her into life. But a frayling does not know how to be alive—and she is haunted by a curse she cannot shake: every Starchild she loves will die.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Yet destiny, too, follows her—the legend of a queen that shall return to reclaim the Anonyma, the kingdom that was taken from her. To be worthy of her throne, she must break curses, shatter silence, and learn again and again how to live.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">And with the coming of an apocalypse, she must cross an impossible Sea.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">But should she fail to break the curse of circles...she will descend once more into darkness and lose everything she fought for.</p>

That's exactly what my writing is: Fantasy, but everywhere.

Here's the summary:
A footprint on a Sea. A curse, a devil, and an apocalypse. A queen who does not know she is a queen—or a warrior.
She begins as a frayling—a creature torn from life itself by grief and guilt.
Her relentless, desperate quest to find the soul of a forgotten Starchild thrusts her into life. But a frayling does not know how to be alive—and she is haunted by a curse she cannot shake: every Starchild she loves will die.
Yet destiny, too, follows her—the legend of a queen that shall return to reclaim the Anonyma, the kingdom that was taken from her. To be worthy of her throne, she must break curses, shatter silence, and learn again and again how to live.
And with the coming of an apocalypse, she must cross an impossible Sea.
But should she fail to break the curse of circles...she will descend once more into darkness and lose everything she fought for.
Told in a gothic style, Seastrider is the coming-of-age story of a young warrior queen’s journey from death to life—and the war to discover herself.
But this book is not just my first brainchild — it's me.

<h3><a href=""http://underratedreads.com/more-time-to-love-one-fathers-extraordinary-journal-of-living-longer-with-als-joseph-l-wions/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Read Our Review at www.underratedreads.com</a></h3>

<p>(Reviewed by <a href=""http://underratedreads.com/oac/pat-luboff/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Pat Luboff</a>)</p>
<p>I have a confession to make.  I finished reading this book a while ago.  I was stunned into silence, unable to approach writing the review. The book has haunted me since.</p>
<p>My father went the usual route of people diagnosed with ALS. The doctor says, “You have ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, aka Lou Gehrig’s Disease), you will die in two years.” Patient dies in two years, or, in the case of my father, less.  Joseph Wions traveled the road less taken. He decided that the usual medical model should be ignored because it offered no hope.  Instead, he explored a wide, I would say dazzling, and sometimes to me, confusing variety of alternative approaches to healing his body from the disease.</p>
<p>In this book, he describes this journey in intimate details.  He takes us from the first twinges that signaled something was wrong with his body to his ultimate spiritual triumph over the terror the disease inflicts on its victims.  Sidebars give us insights from his family and friends.  Excerpts from emails Wions broadcasted to family, friends and co-workers show his public persona, while his own journal writing takes us to the depths of his heart, mind and soul as he faces increasing physical limitations.  What emerges is a portrait of a human being of great intelligence and wisdom and love.</p>
<p>I’m still a little baffled as to how to tackle this review. I think it’s best to just give you a few quotations.  While he says these things in reference to his struggle with ALS, they ring true for me, and I bet they do for you:</p>
<p>”I learned that I had become addicted to a thought process that was not supportive of healing.  The conscious choice that I made to change it has pitted me against all conventional wisdom, which insists that escaping death from ALS is not only unrealistic, but impossible.”</p>
<p>“It takes considerable diligence to stay on the productive side of that fine line between surrender and resignation.  To effectively surrender, I must stay in the moment and abandon all judgments and projections that will invariably generate fear and doubt.  The minute a connection is made between the current circumstances and past experience or future expectations, the moment opens up to a frightening array of negative emotions, which limits me physically and further fuels the fears I have created.”</p>
<p>“When my muscles atrophied to the point that a motorized vehicle was required, I had to find new ways to have fun.”</p>
<p>”I can tell myself over and over again that I am going to beat this disease, but my gut is quick to remind me that I have not yet overcome my addiction to the fear of failure.”</p>
<p>“It took me a while to realize that letting others help me do things that I could no longer do myself was a way of helping them.”</p>
<p>“I have emerged from the nightmare of belief that a horrible and untimely death was rapidly approaching.  Several years after I was expected to be gone, I am still here and have enjoyed miraculous enhancements in my psychological, emotional, spiritual, and physical health.”</p>
<p>This is a must-read book for anyone who has a family member or friend diagnosed with ALS.  In addition to his incredible personal story, Wions offers an appendix of advice and resources on the services and equipment needed by a person who has ALS.  I also highly recommend it for anyone who is facing any physical or emotional challenge.  And who isn’t?</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>How and why did <a href=""http://www.moretimetolove.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong><i>More Time to Love</i></strong></a> come to exist?</h3>
<p>Joe's writing began as a journal of emotions during a dark time. With a diagnosis of ALS, he had little clarity as to how to move forward. What inspired this book was the journal's transformation from an outlet of despair into an inspiring journey of gratitude and love, which gave birth to the initial working title, <i>From Nightmares to Miracles</i>.  In his proposal to publishers, Joe stated:</p>
<p><i>""My purpose in writing this book is to share my story about the impact of ALS, how I have grown from the experience, and what I have learned as a result. It is my fondest wish that this story will provide hope and inspiration to others who are fighting this devastating disease, and to anyone who is facing a formidable challenge.""</i></p>
<p>When we look back on his writing, his growth and transformation, while extraordinary, are not the only engaging aspects of this book. Just as astonishing is how his community rose to the challenge of support, and embraced the Wions family's cause as their own. Joe's ability to motivate, teach, and enlist help from the people around him was just as impressive as what he was able to accomplish with regard to ALS. The more love and value he created around himself, the more he inspired and helped others. And so this book became not only about the extension and improvement of the life of an ALS patient, but about amplifying the love, and sharing his strategies for dealing with hardship with all who could benefit.</p>
<h3>How is this book different from other books about ALS patients? How was Joe Wions' approach unique?</h3>
<p>Joe was a tireless data collector and motivator, and an active member of a support group of ALS patients called <a href=""http://healingwithdrcraig.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Healers with ALS (HALS)</a>, many of whom are living 10-30 years beyond their prognosis. A few members from this community are in the process of writing their own books—some offering nutritional regimens through which they received positive results, others sharing their experience in an attempt to raise awareness and money for research. While Joe does both of these things, <a href=""http://www.moretimetolove.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong><i>More Time to Love</i></strong></a> is not just about dealing with ALS; it offers insight and inspiration to anyone faced with overwhelming challenge or hardship. Joe's book is designed to help people put their problems in perspective, give them hope, focus their energies on the good in their lives and the choices they have the power to make, and motivate them to act on those choices to live healthier, more deliberate and satisfying lives. <i><strong>Tuesdays With Morrie</strong></i>, by Mitch Album, inspired millions to make the most of each day through Morrie's example of appreciating the beauty and love in his life as he accepted his demise. However, while Morrie's story is about making peace with dying, Joe (with similar dignity, humor, wisdom, and grace) fought for his life, and fought to find a cure for the disease. The Joe Wions story has the potential to inspire and empower anyone struggling with chronic illness, by modeling an indefatigable intention to live fully, and an unwavering determination to do what it takes to beat the odds.</p>

<p>It's difficult for me to ask others for help, especially this much money. I always think I can/should do it all myself, but honestly, I can't. </p>
<p>Indiegogo.com suggests small realistic funding goals, perhaps divide the actual need into multiple campaigns with numbers that seem reasonable. Maybe I should have done that. $10,500 is a daunting number, but honestly, that is precisely what it's going to cost to get the editing done. </p>
<p>Incentives designed to reward your contributions are listed elsewhere on the page. Know that you will have my lasting gratitude for everything you do to help, even if all you can do is contribute a small amount. Even small contributions are very important!

Encourage your friends to join us at a level they can easily afford. </p>
<p><b>About Tim Brost</b></p>
<p>Like many writers, I rely on a rich open inner life to explore and explain
what I see around me. I allow my characters to be who
and what they are, aside from who I am. The goal is to let them roam freely without meddling mannerisms or authorial interference. As composite stand-ins for real people, they deserve to be read, to tell their stories,
impart insight and to entertain. <br/></p>
<p>My work experience is varied and somewhat irrelevant. What is relevant is the reduction in cost some acquired skills bring to the project. I've been a Creative Director and Webmaster. I've served on web and social media teams for various high-profile organizations for many years. I've worked in a tech company. Among the most relevant positions, I managed the publishing division of a prominent dot org. </p>
<p>In contrast with a rich marketing career, I have a degree in the study of Religion. I’m trained in, and for a time taught for a private organization called Advanced Tactical Reconnaissance. I also trained under a Zen master to be a teacher. I am not a teacher. Follow my spiritual path and you will simply arrive at impermanence and imperfection. Perhaps because of the breadth of seemingly conflicted avocations, I see the world differently than some. My own perspective inevitably, but with restraint, finds its way into the novels. </p>
<p><b>The team</b></p>
<p>I'm working with one of the best editing teams available. <a href=""http://ka-writing.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kevin Anderson and Associates</a> is excited to begin the laborious task of polishing 210,000 words. These novels deserve the best and we've already started to give them the attention they deserve.</p>
<p><b>How to advocate</b></p>
<p>Please tell your friends, on FB, Twitter, Instagram, on the phone and across the table. Send out a link through SMS or email. Give me a shout out. Mention that you know a novelist who writes about international conflict and cyber crime. To be specific, you can:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/authortimbrost/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Like authortimbrost on Facebook</a><br/>

</li>
<li>
<a href=""http://timbrost.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Send acquaintances to TimBrost.com</a><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>And it's not just about the novels. I already share links and other resources to the research behind these works of fiction, on my web site. Dig into the material as deeply as you want. Over time I'll add much more, and curate the information. I may even include interviews of prominent subject matter experts, so stick with me through the campaign and beyond. </p>
<p>As I'm fond of saying, ""Here we go!""</p>
<br/><p></p>
</div></div>","The most dangerous person in the world of cyber security, is the insider. In the world of global conflict, the insider is the most informative. I've created three new works of fiction that take the reader inside of these worlds, to points of view seldom experienced. Your contribution today will help me reach the market in July! 

Trade Bangkok, a novel, is the first read in the Trade Series. 


Trade Azerbaijan, a short read, sits between novels in the series. 


High-Rise Crew Dirty Money is the first book in the High-Rise Crew trilogy.

Releasing three major works of fiction at one time is possibly unique, certainly a challenge. I've been working for many years to prepare. The drive to bring these stories, these characters to life, is motivation to succeed. With your contributions, I will. 
The process
The writing is done. Thankfully, I don't need outside help for much of the marketing effort. Cover designs, book layouts, building and maintaining a web presence are all skills I've managed to collect over the years. The video at the top of the page was recorded by a great friend for free. I assembled the video in Premier to avoid the cost of a professional (I know. It shows.)
I understand marketing and the publishing business well enough to move forward, but there is no easy way around editing. Hiring competent editors is an unavoidable but necessary expense, and frankly, I just don't have the cash.
Other writers will relate to the need for a second, third and fourth set of eyes to point out substantive changes, hint at grammatical fixes and provide endless proofreading. I want all of that, can't yet afford it, here we are. This campaign is solely about resources for editing. Will these novels sell? I think so. Your contribution will help make the difference.

members currently on the front lines in the Middle East. I am in contact with a
counter-extremism think tank to verify assumptions applied to some of my characters. Trade novels explore the business side of managing conflict through
the medium of compelling fiction. Stakes could not be higher in Trade Azerbaijan. Are weapons of mass
destruction secured? Is the world at war? My characters imply what insiders say privately. You'll find that the pace and tone of the Trade Series builds with each installment, toward an amazing and unpredictable crescendo. Welcome to the trade.The third piece of fiction launches the High-Rise Crew Trilogy. The arc of these novels show cyber crime from many perspectives, beginning with the street-level black hat novel, High-Rise
Crew Dirty Money (95,000 words). Follow the nefarious activities of an
unlikely Chicago-based crew as they evolve through common theft, identity theft, carding, and corporate phishing expeditions, leading to the big con. No novel of this type would be complete without unpredictable conflicts between characters, and the promise of big money. If you like Dirty Money, you'll love what comes next, High-Rise Crew Financial Insiders will be released early in 2017. It raises the curtain on corporate espionage, insider theft and the prospect of global organized cyber crime. 

Subject matter experts for this series include a certified security specialist for the Federal Reserve, a retired Secret Service cyber crime specialist, and a military expert. Endless research further informs the novels. 
About the cost and perks
It's difficult for me to ask others for help, especially this much money. I always think I can/should do it all myself, but honestly, I can't. 
Indiegogo.com suggests small realistic funding goals, perhaps divide the actual need into multiple campaigns with numbers that seem reasonable. Maybe I should have done that. $10,500 is a daunting number, but honestly, that is precisely what it's going to cost to get the editing done.

About Tim Brost
Like many writers, I rely on a rich open inner life to explore and explain
what I see around me. I allow my characters to be who
and what they are, aside from who I am. The goal is to let them roam freely without meddling mannerisms or authorial interference. As composite stand-ins for real people, they deserve to be read, to tell their stories,
impart insight and to entertain. 
My work experience is varied and somewhat irrelevant. What is relevant is the reduction in cost some acquired skills bring to the project. I've been a Creative Director and Webmaster. I've served on web and social media teams for various high-profile organizations for many years. I've worked in a tech company. Among the most relevant positions, I managed the publishing division of a prominent dot org. 
In contrast with a rich marketing career, I have a degree in the study of Religion. I’m trained in, and for a time taught for a private organization called Advanced Tactical Reconnaissance. I also trained under a Zen master to be a teacher. I am not a teacher. Follow my spiritual path and you will simply arrive at impermanence and imperfection. Perhaps because of the breadth of seemingly conflicted avocations, I see the world differently than some. My own perspective inevitably, but with restraint, finds its way into the novels. 
The team
I'm working with one of the best editing teams available. Kevin Anderson and Associates is excited to begin the laborious task of polishing 210,000 words. These novels deserve the best and we've already started to give them the attention they deserve.
How to advocate
Please tell your friends, on FB, Twitter, Instagram, on the phone and across the table. Send out a link through SMS or email. Give me a shout out. Mention that you know a novelist who writes about international conflict and cyber crime. To be specific, you can:

Send acquaintances to TimBrost.com



And it's not just about the novels. I already share links and other resources to the research behind these works of fiction, on my web site. Dig into the material as deeply as you want. Over time I'll add much more, and curate the information. I may even include interviews of prominent subject matter experts, so stick with me through the campaign and beyond.

<p><b>  Desdemona’s
Dreams, Volume II: The Land of Mar</b></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h1></h1>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Hi, I'm Z.W. Mohr, published poet, and author of the series Desdemona's Dreams. I live in the city of New Orleans, a place fertile with inspiration.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">13 years ago, while living in California, I began to write a poem about a little girl named Desdemona that can bring her dreams into the real world. I had no idea at the time how meaningful this story would become, nor how far it would take me. I started to realize that the story I was writing was as much about me, as it was about Desdemona. I wanted to bridge the gap between just dreaming about something, and actually making it real. The farther into her dream world I went, the closer I came to my own aspirations of being an author.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">As Desdemona's imagination unlocked countless wonders, she stood up for what she believed in, and discovered who she really was, I was right there with her realizing the same things about myself. When I shared it with a close friend she brought it to my attention that this story has the chance to inspire other people in the same way that it did me. From there it was my personal quest to finish the story, find a talented illustrator, and release it as one giant book into the world. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">It took some years, but I finished the story, found Aaron Damon Porter, and then realized that for Desdemona's Dreams to become a reality, I needed to go back to the drawing board. As a massive poem, though beautiful, it was inaccessible to most readers, and that was the last thing I wanted my work to be. Aaron and I decided to break it up into volumes, and I've been converting the real world scenes into prose ever since. We published the first Volume, To Dream of Dancing, in February 2016, and have been overjoyed by the marvelous response it's received. Parents and children alike have been telling us how excited they are for another book in the series, and we have 14 more books to go.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> Aaron is going to be spending the Summer illustrating the next volume, and while he's creating beautiful images, I'll continue to edit, and fine tune the text. I'm in the process of editing The Land of Mar as I write this, and I can't wait to see what incredible artwork Aaron's going to come up with. We both want to put a series out that will inspire and nourish the minds of kids and adults alike, but we need your help to make that happen. </span></p></span></h1><br/>

</div>","Turning Dreams Into Realities


  Desdemona’s
Dreams, Volume II: The Land of Mar




Hi, I'm Z.W. Mohr, published poet, and author of the series Desdemona's Dreams. I live in the city of New Orleans, a place fertile with inspiration.
13 years ago, while living in California, I began to write a poem about a little girl named Desdemona that can bring her dreams into the real world. I had no idea at the time how meaningful this story would become, nor how far it would take me. I started to realize that the story I was writing was as much about me, as it was about Desdemona. I wanted to bridge the gap between just dreaming about something, and actually making it real. The farther into her dream world I went, the closer I came to my own aspirations of being an author.
As Desdemona's imagination unlocked countless wonders, she stood up for what she believed in, and discovered who she really was, I was right there with her realizing the same things about myself. When I shared it with a close friend she brought it to my attention that this story has the chance to inspire other people in the same way that it did me. From there it was my personal quest to finish the story, find a talented illustrator, and release it as one giant book into the world. 
It took some years, but I finished the story, found Aaron Damon Porter, and then realized that for Desdemona's Dreams to become a reality, I needed to go back to the drawing board. As a massive poem, though beautiful, it was inaccessible to most readers, and that was the last thing I wanted my work to be. Aaron and I decided to break it up into volumes, and I've been converting the real world scenes into prose ever since. We published the first Volume, To Dream of Dancing, in February 2016, and have been overjoyed by the marvelous response it's received. Parents and children alike have been telling us how excited they are for another book in the series, and we have 14 more books to go.
 Aaron is going to be spending the Summer illustrating the next volume, and while he's creating beautiful images, I'll continue to edit, and fine tune the text. I'm in the process of editing The Land of Mar as I write this, and I can't wait to see what incredible artwork Aaron's going to come up with. We both want to put a series out that will inspire and nourish the minds of kids and adults alike, but we need your help to make that happen. 


What Your Funding Will Do

Our Goal Is $16,000
1.$9,000 goes towards the artwork (materials and time,
supporting the illustrator as he  commits to this project full-time for
3 months.)

2.$3,000 will pay for a professional publicity
campaign,
marketing,
and entry fees for awards and festivals, so we can get the word out
to
everyone about this book. Let's pave the way for the rest of the series!

3. $3,000 will pay for the first printing run of books,
and for converting it into an E-book for tablets, kindles, computers and phones
- the more access to our story, the better.

4. $1,000 will pay the paperwork fees - copyrighting,
licensing renewal for our company, Desdemona’s Dreams L.L.C., etc. This segment
will also pay the production costs for a first-run of artist prints of the
original work from Volume II.

<p>""Reading Isaac Xavier’s poetry is a mindfulness exercise in itself. When he “looks”, he truly “sees”, whether he’s pondering the joys of love (not a “fall” into love but “an ascent”), enjoying the  “crimson hairdo” of a rambutan or watching a torrential rainstorm pound the sea. He’s “in the moment”. And he takes you, the reader, there with him.""</p>

What Others Have Said:
""Isaac Xavier is a unique poet.
On seeing Isaac you instantly know he is a very fit and healthy individual. The fact that he is Health Coach and Rehabilitation Specialist comes as no surprise.
On meeting, talking to, and then discovering  that he is such a moving poet, makes him an extraordinary individual.
Whether his body informs his mind, or his mind informs his body, the fact is Isaac's poetry is a rare combination of both.""
- Ellen Komesarook , Athlete and Montessori Educator, USA 
 
""Isaac Xavier’s skill as a rehabilitation specialist is in fixing bodies and focussing minds. In his debut as a poet, we come to realise he is also very much about healing hearts.'It began with a Hummingbird' is a sensitive collection through the eyes of a soulful man.""
- Martine Harte, Award winning television journalistDigital publisher - engaging women.com.au
 
""Reading Isaac Xavier’s poetry is a mindfulness exercise in itself. When he “looks”, he truly “sees”, whether he’s pondering the joys of love (not a “fall” into love but “an ascent”), enjoying the  “crimson hairdo” of a rambutan or watching a torrential rainstorm pound the sea. He’s “in the moment”. And he takes you, the reader, there with him.""
- Liz Porter, Award-winning Melbourne journalist, novelist and forensic science writer

<p><strong>More about this fund-raising appeal</strong></p>
<p>What it's about, above all, is helping get a vital piece of radical history back into the hands of those who made it.</p>
<p>The English-language edition of my book, ""Bolivia's Radical Tradition,"" came out several years ago. It has always been my goal to produce a Spanish-language version for a key Bolivian, and more broadly Latin American, audience. Bolivia is one of the places where this kind of radical history, together with the ideas and hard-fought struggles it emerged from, are deeply meaningful to significant numbers of working-class, indigenous, campesino and student activists. Yet many of the key documents and other sources were scattered through the world in archives from Paris to Potosi, El Alto to Palo Alto. An accurate account and interpretation was, moreover, lacking until now. At least that's how it always seemed to me.</p>
<p>To do the Spanish edition and be able to bring it back to Bolivia required years of work. This involved reviewing the original sources, making additions to the text, and translating the  book myself (with crucial input from a colleague in Mexico). This was a ""labor of love,"" and one I hoped to finish while the most important participants in this project -- the movement veterans I'd interviewed ---- were still alive. This has not been the case for more than a few of them, but others are still there in La Paz, El Alto, Cochabamba and elsewhere. I believe it is important to give them the book and talk with them about it while that's still possible.</p>
<p>I was asked to ""present"" (launch) the book (called ""El trotskismo boliviano"" in Spanish) at the International Book Fair in La Paz. For money and work reasons this could not be arranged (particularly not for an adjunct professor still waiting for the semester's first paycheck).</p>
<p>However, a book launch is being organized in La Paz very soon. My companion and I were able to use frequent flier miles to cover most of the airfare for us to get there in late September. The basic targets of the funds I need to raise are remaining travel expenses including visa, inoculation, travel, lodging, food and likely book-publicity expenses within Bolivia; a number of copies of the Spanish-language book for libraries and individuals; several copies of the English-language book (which, unlike the Spanish one, includes the collection of historic photos) for the same objective; as well as expenses for further related research.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Have you ever wanted to improve your life? </h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">To be a better woman tomorrow than you are today?</h3>
<p>Picture it:  Los Angeles, California, 1980-ish.  I sat quietly outside the kitchen and listened as my mother and other relatives ripped to shreds a book called <i>Fascinating Womanhood</i>.  After hearing about how much they hated the book, I could not wait to read it, thinking that the book would be full of racy details. </p>
<p>I was disappointed, in a way, because the book was, perhaps, PG-rated.  However, the book changed my life as no other book had or would, with the exception of <i>The Bible</i>. </p>
<p>Mrs. Andelin's book touched my heart and made me realize that I wanted my marriage to be different from those I had observed in my family and in my friend's families.  I realized that I wanted to become a more loving and feminine woman and to enjoy a happy, companionable relationship rather than a combative relationship.  I achieved my goals and wanted to share my experience with other women.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2004, when I began teaching marriage enrichment classes using Mrs. Andelin's book as a textbook.  Hundreds of women have benefited from my classes, and from those classes, I originated my own teaching materials and presentations: a curriculum, if you will.  I now wish to publish my curriculum beyond my classes, and I invite you to help me to improve women's lives the world over.</p>
<p><u><strong>What You Will Receive</strong></u></p>
<p>Contributors from the United States will receive their choice of a personalized PDF version of the book <i><strong>or</strong> </i>a softcover copy of the book inscribed to them and signed by me.</p>
<p>Contributors outside the United States will receive a personalized PDF version of the book.  Alas, due to shipping costs, the softcover copy of the book is not available as a perk to contributors beyond the borders of the United States.</p>
<p>After the book is published, I intend to donate ten percent of my profits to an organization that helps  parents.  You will enjoy the knowledge that you helped not only me but other women to improve their lives.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Renier Gertzen. Before we had children I was very involved as a dog trainer working with Rottweilers. Unfortunately our lives became too busy and we had to park dog training. These days we (my wife and I) employ the techniques and principles we used in dog training to make good citizens of our children.</p>
<p>Many people have asked us for advice in dealing with situations that they battle with. It started to dawn on us that we are doing something different. Everyone kept referring to that fact but we didn't quite knew what they meant. Then... One day we were battling with an issue with our eldest daughter and the wife turned to me and asked, how would I fix this in Qadesh (my Rottweiler bitch of 3 years)?  Then it dawned on me, we are doing something different, we are using the best tool we had... our knowledge of dog training. We sat down and discussed this at length and started to realize that since Isla was born, all the major obstacles we faced, we used dog training principles to overcome them. It was only recently that I decided that this is something worth sharing with other parents and promptly started to write this book.</p>
<p>We found that dog training principles work, because there are much less noise (tantrums, crying, yelling, screaming, arghhh....). With dogs, it is much easier to see the actual problem or behavior that needs to be corrected.</p>
<p>I have thought long and hard about how to approach this project and make this available to parent everywhere and eventually stumbled onto this website. Your support will make it possible to share this knowledge with parents, helping them to raise and... survive their toddler.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>My primary goal is to reach at the very least a stage where the book is professionally edited and printed. Estimated cost for reaching this goal is $6500.</p>
<p>Below I am attaching a breakdown of how the funds will be applied, should that level of funding be reached:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479793326/e2o8hp3bjvay0qz4mqgh.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>At the moment, all contributors ($5 and above) will receive an e-book. Should this campaign reach level 4, the book will finally go to print. When this happens, more perks will be unlocked, which will give contributors the opportunity to convert their e-books to printed books or add additional printed books (in addition to the e-books).</p>
<p>All funds would be applied towards this project, even if the goal is not reached. $90 will probably not afford editing of any kind, but at least it would go towards obtaining the ISBN numbers.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Many parents struggle with the same issues we had. This book will not detail how every problem a parent might face can be solved, but it will give a clear methodology in Part 1 of the book that will equip parents to deal with these problems. Part 2 of the book deals with things that a parent need to keep in mind when utilizing the techniques in Part 1. Lastly, some of the ""tools"" that makes coping with toddlers easeir are highlighted in Part 3. All this will enable a parent to influence situations to achieve the best possible outcome.</p>
<p>This is a book that every parent of a toddler out there should have.</p>
