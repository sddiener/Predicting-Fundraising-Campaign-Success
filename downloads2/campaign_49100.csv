However, all of our factory workers have come back from holidays, and will work on the project as soon as our project gets funded successfully. Our delivery business partner will provide fast and secured solutions to make sure your Evanana arrives within the estimated time frames. Once our project gets successfully funded on Kickstarter, we will send out a survey enquiring about all of our backers' measurements and size needed. We will also send emails to notify you when we have all of our products ready, when we dispatch your orders and your tracking numbers. You are very welcome to send us an email anytime or make an enquiry on our campaign page directly if you have any questions in regards to orders details, shipping times and so on. Our staff members will work on your request as soon as possible.</p><p> </p><h3>Environmental commitments</h3><p><strong>Long-lasting design</strong></p><p>All of our activewears have a minimalist, stylish and functional design. The sports bras are adjustable for different intensity level of trainings and our activewear sets are suitable for all kinds of sports. The ultrachlorine resistant and UV protection features also make it perfect for outdoor trainings and water activities. In addition, our activewears are made by ECONYL® regenerated nylon, featuring high quality, long-lasting and sustainable fabrics.</p><p><strong>Reusability and recyclability</strong></p><p>Our activewears are all using sustainable fabrics, which are made by ECONYL® regenerated nylon yarn derived from pre and post industrial waste such as discarded fishing nets, carpet fluff (the top part of Nylon carpets which have got to the end of their useful life), tulle etc. All such materials, once they have reached the end of their useful life, instead of being disposed of in the landfill, are recovered and regenerated by means of a complex chemical-physical process. The fabric has the same features as virgin nylon in terms of performance and quality, but with the plus of not having been produced with the use of non renewable fossil raw materials. We will also be using 100% degradable packagings for our activewears to minimise our waste as much as possible.</p><p><strong>Sustainable materials</strong></p><p>We will be using a sustainable techno-fabric, made of a ECONYL® regenerated Nylon, which boasts excellent recovery power and always the perfect muscular compression aimed at decreasing the production of lactic acid, thus boosting a faster recovery of energy. Soft and pleasant on the skin, compact and breathable, it is also highly UV protective ( UPF 50+).</p><p><strong>Environmentally friendly factories</strong></p><p>Our partnered fabrics suppliers have qualifications to show their commitment to the environment such as HIGG Facility environmental module, Certificate ISO 14001:2015 and so on. Both our fabric suppliers and manufacturers strictly follow global recycled standards and policies to contribute to the environment and ensure a safe and ethical working environment.</p><p><strong>Sustainable Distribution</strong></p><p>Our product packaging will all use environmental-friendly solutions such as 100% biodegradable bags. We are aiming to compensate for the CO2 emissions caused by the shipment of our products and leave the environmental footprint as low as possible.</p><h3> </h3></div>","FREE SHIPPING TO ALL OVER THE WORLD Designed for Performance and Freedom with an unapologetic commitment to Excellence. Ever feel frustrated by switching clothes for water sports?

The sports bras are adjustable for different intensity level of trainings and our activewear sets are suitable for all kinds of sports. The ultrachlorine resistant and UV protection features also make it perfect for outdoor trainings and water activities. In addition, our activewears are made by ECONYL® regenerated nylon, featuring high quality, long-lasting and sustainable fabrics.Reusability and recyclabilityOur activewears are all using sustainable fabrics, which are made by ECONYL® regenerated nylon yarn derived from pre and post industrial waste such as discarded fishing nets, carpet fluff (the top part of Nylon carpets which have got to the end of their useful life), tulle etc. All such materials, once they have reached the end of their useful life, instead of being disposed of in the landfill, are recovered and regenerated by means of a complex chemical-physical process. The fabric has the same features as virgin nylon in terms of performance and quality, but with the plus of not having been produced with the use of non renewable fossil raw materials. We will also be using 100% degradable packagings for our activewears to minimise our waste as much as possible.Sustainable materialsWe will be using a sustainable techno-fabric, made of a ECONYL® regenerated Nylon, which boasts excellent recovery power and always the perfect muscular compression aimed at decreasing the production of lactic acid, thus boosting a faster recovery of energy. Soft and pleasant on the skin, compact and breathable, it is also highly UV protective ( UPF 50+).Environmentally friendly factoriesOur partnered fabrics suppliers have qualifications to show their commitment to the environment such as HIGG Facility environmental module, Certificate ISO 14001:2015 and so on. Both our fabric suppliers and manufacturers strictly follow global recycled standards and policies to contribute to the environment and ensure a safe and ethical working environment.Sustainable DistributionOur product packaging will all use environmental-friendly solutions such as 100% biodegradable bags. We are aiming to compensate for the CO2 emissions caused by the shipment of our products and leave the environmental footprint as low as possible.",58.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div></div>","What is XIX BackPack?



The X shaped buckle attached to the bag allows the straps to be
  converted into an X shape as well allowing for equal weight distribution
  between the shoulders and the hips relieving overall stress and fatigue from extended period of carrying.









Differences
  between traditional backpacks & XIX 







Existing backpacks are designed to have two straps on each side
  and this places 100% of the weight on your
  back and shoulders.

  XIX backpack uses the X buckle and the side straps to create and X-shape
  with the straps, transferring weight distribution to be 60% on your back and
  40% to your front relieving your back and lower back from unnecessary
  fatigue. This design proves helpful for those that have back issues and
  especially helpful for children to carry around a lot of weight on their back
  due to school or other activities. 






When you connect the X buckle and tighten the the straps at the
  bottom, more than 40% of the weight will be distributed to the front of your
  body and not your back.






1. Body
  Correction






Carrying
  heavy bags during growth can cause spine issues in younger children. 


<By: Nicole Phillips, Intern APU>




Especially
  for children that carry more than 3.5 kg on average putting all the pressure
  on their back moving their center of gravity requiring them to lean forward
  in order to compensate. This can cause negative effects on their spines. 







From our
  previous statement, XIX Backpacks uses its X buckle to create an X shape with
  the straps distribution weight from 100% to the back to 60/40 back front. 








2. Fatigue ReliefIn today's day and age, people must carry around multiple items to adapt to
  today's highly developed society. Bags are used to carry laptops, tablets,
  smartphones, etc. and these can be carried all at the same time. 

  When
  walking around while carrying your bag, there is one thing in common you will
  find with others like yourself. 

  Even if each person has their own car, on average each person will carry
  around their own bag for about an hour a day experiencing discomfort in their
  shoulder, waist, or back. Most people repeat this behavior on a daily basis.
  

  XIX Backpack and its X buckle allows you to secure your bag tightly to your
  body for when doing other activities like hiking, bike riding, or other
  activities where having a secure bag helps reduce energy consumption and
  weight distribution.



Details












To accommodate for people that carry around the most common
  items like laptops, tablets, smartphones, etc. there are specialized and
  separate compartments for each so you know exactly where each of your devices
  is located for easy retrieval. Also, the side pockets have a space for
  an external battery to charge your devices while never exposing the battery
  or any cables to the outside. There's a hole on that leads into the main
  compartment of the bag allowing instant access for charging. 








The bag is constructed of extremely durable 100% nylon and on
  the inside and outside. And with its waterproof coating, the bag will stay
  dry in rain or now and will not damage the bag.

The team is lead by Eran Reuveni, an 
		industrial engineer, entrepreneur, co-founder of a successful software 
company that now employs 120 people, and inventor of the Smart Strap; and Gilad Kirshenboim, an experienced electronics engineer 
who participated in the development of many products before. We’re working with 
a great team of professional designers and developers.
Q: Who created the detailed design of the product?
The industrial design of the smart strap (mainly, the buckle) is the
work of the very talented team at Tenenbaum Hazan Design studio.
INDIEGOGO & PRE-ORDERS
Q: What is the Indiegogo crowdfunding platform?
Indiegogo enables inventors like us to bring our dreams to life while
focusing on what’s important: our customers – which is a lot better than chasing after
venture capital investors. Learn more here.
Q: What assurances do I get that you will deliver the product I am
ordering?
Once we reach our funding goal you’re in good hands (if we don’t
reach the goal, then you don’t pay anything). Technologically, we are not doing
anything too complex or risky, so we are very confident of our ability to
deliver on our promise. Also: learn how Indiegogo protects you from frauds.
Q: How can I follow up on my order and get updates?
Please follow our Indiegogo campaign page for general updates on the
development of the Modillian smart strap. When we begin manufacturing the final
products, we will contact you about your specific delivery.",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<br/></b><p></p></div>","Deerfield Beach's footwear design firm Brigands Militia www.brigmi.com brings you its Spring Collection with ""Sandals For The Homeless"" partnering with South Florida's Homeless Voice www.homelessvoice.org to  donate an  Exuberant amount of sandals PLUS 20% of all proceeds will be donated to the Homeless Voice!





Who is Brigands Militia?
Brigands Militia is a footwear design company, that designs and distributes the Brigmi Hybrid Sandal from Deerfield Beach, FL,  The sandals are designed to be lightweight like a flip flop, yet strong like a heavy sandal for durability, without the need to harm animals (shhh...  they are vegan sandals!)  
President of Brigands Militia, Carlos Lopez Avery  ""When it comes to sandals, we boot our best foot forward!"" he said  smiling ""Were hoping to be able to donate close to 500 pairs of sandals plus we are donating 20% of all proceeds to  the HOMELESS VOICE , with your help and that of our community!  Every Little Bit Helps!  Don't forget to tell a friend and a family member!""








The Perks
For every sandal that you purchase, there will also be a sandal donated to a homeless person, this is our One 4 One motto.  We will be starting off by allowing contributors to choose which price they wish to pay!  You can get a quality pair of sandals for your self and a homeless person for as little as $1!

YES I said $1!!!!


Each reward is limited to a certain amount so get yours at the best price before they are gone.
Each Perk up to the $25 gives you (1) One Pair of sandals for YOU & (1) One Pair for a Homeless person!! 
The $25 Reward, will be unlimited, allowing the community the leverage to drive this campaign as far as they wish.  This perk allows for the financial balancing of the loss of the sandals, and helps to gather more funds for the Homeless Voice.


Why Are We Doing This?
The homeless in South Florida have to struggle through some of the roughest heat spells that Spring and Summer bring to South Florida YEARLY, that most of use don't pay much mind too, because most of us have shoes, sandals or both, but not EVERYONE.  The heat can cause blistering on your feet from the high temperatures on the street.  The homeless should have adequate footwear to help prevent potential blister infections and diseases caused from walking barefoot on the streets.
.....they deserve better!!.  


The Homeless Voice, is the voice of the homeless in South Florida.  
They are a small non-profit that runs the #1 emergency and response shelter in South Florida. They serve, house, and care for 500 homeless every day, and have costs like any other business: water, power, rent, programs, staff and legal help. 
 The Homeless Voice is extremely effective. It is a place where anyone in need will get help. It is a safe place for people to go when they have nowhere else to turn. They take no government funds. They run on donations averaging about 33 cents. They Need You Help!



If helping people is important to you as it is important for us, Click on a Perk and buy a sandal for the cause, remember its One 4 One!



Some of the wonderful people that work there are Director Sean Cononie, Editor Mark Targett, and Coordinator/Manager Christine Jordan.

              



You buy a sandal, we donate a sandal, its as easy as that!
How can we do that??  We believe in community capitalism, we make a small profit to run the business and we pay it back by making a significant impact on our community.   




Our Success Is Up to You!  Every Penny Helps!!!!!!!!!


We need your help to make this a reality!

The Sandals
The Brigmi Hybrid Sandal is on its third design, and we know your going to love the designs for the Spring-Summer time.  

                             


The sandals bottom sole will be approximately 30% thicker, the upper sole will be a faux suede leather that feels soft to the touch, yet extremely durable. We have also added arch support to all our sandals.


                               
The Colors have gone through a redevelopment also. Now we have Rustic Red, Naval Blue, Camo Green and the Original Brigmi Orange


The Brigmi Sticker


This Sticker in Included in the $100 Perk! its a 6x6 and looks stunning!
Don't forget to tell us your size and color
SANDALS SIZES AVAILABLE:  Sizes 8 - 9 - 10 - 11 - 12


Why Do We Need $16,700?
We need to make a minimum order purchase to get the 4 colors manufactured, so we need a minimum of $16,700 to manufacture the sandals.  The inventory will be large enough where we should have more than enough sandals to fill all the orders.
This includes Everything






We need your help to make this a reality!





    Risks & Challenges Working with our manufacturer our timeline will be as follows:



January: Campaign Ends/Orders are Placed. 30 day turnaround


Febuary 15-28: Production run ending in approx 30 days. Sandals Shipped


April: Shipping can take approx 30 days, by Mid April, sandals have arrived.


All Shipping to contributors will occur immediately once shipment has arrived in Deerfield Beach, FL. 
We have been in communication with the footwear production company & we do not expect any delays.  All logistics are already set for shipping.

Sandals for the homeless will be transported by truck to the Homeless Voice, and distribution will occur there.  We plan on Streaming live the distribution of the sandals or recording the distribution, this has not been fully decided yet which, You The Community can decide, message us! ***
   Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, and we totally understand but that doesn't mean you can't help:  Help us out by asking folks to get the word out and make some noise about our campaign and what we are doing. Remember to share us out to the world using  Indiegogo,  Facebook, and Twitter!!  Tell your friends and family!!   Thank you All for your generosity and Kindness!  The Sandals For The Homeless Team, The Homeless Voice and the homeless of South Florida are very very grateful for your contributions, Thank You!!!!!!!!!                              Blessing to you all Our Team:  Carlos Lopez Avery, Christian Pareja, Maritza Tobon and Frankie Nordelus",22.0,0,"1 Campaign

OUR PHILOSOPHY / OUR TEAM



In 2012, we decided to launch the first fashion brand DESIGN TO COST.
Our concept is a direct offer to avoid a middlemen from creation to final sale. We call it Design to Cost.
So you can take advantage of wholesale prices as retailers for a premium positioning.This honest
proposition is based on the following observation  > the market prices are disconnected from the actual value of the products, raising questions about the sincerity of the offer.
catalogue De built clothes with functional fabrics : airy fluidity, smooth technology, sense of well-being and comfortable elegance. Light and clever clothes  to escape the rules of fashion trends. We use the most innovative and intelligent fabrics available to offer  you a feel good effect, the best protection and comfort. Their lightness, their textile structure, their transparency, their surprising and special touch is a strong feature of our style.
Manufacturers
Our clothes are carried out by experienced and reliable manufacturers who kept their production tool since several generations. Their struggle has allowed them to keep most European brands in premium sportswear. We prefer a manufacturing ""made with"" rather than ""made in"". We choose carefully among the world's best manufacturers in the field of textile technology. 
Team






catalogue De is a successful team of Young fashion and design school graduates surrounded by experts to ensure coordination, consistency, and a high quality of products. Our goal is to give voice and a showcase to Young graduates. their source of proposal is a plan for the future covering all aspect of creation : « each new upcoming generation is a breeding ground for innovation ». For this first session, we have selected the best post graduates from MOD’ART International school (fashion/Paris-France) and MARYSE ELOY school ( graphic design/Paris- France). Each of them, like us, is deeply involved in this project. The only compensation paid to each of them, like us, is a percentage depending of the success of this project.

To guarantee the total visual comfort, all lenses come with the multilayer antireflection and the hydrophobic and oleophobic treatments as well.Our sustainable lenses have a lifetime warranty.  Today, optic and fashion stores all over the world are selling sunglasses, whose frames, lenses and packaging are low-costly produced in Asia using extremely harmful plastics.  As a result, their emissions of C02 and highly polluting waste are not only threatening the health of our planet but the lifespan of their employees.We manufacture all our components in Europe in a sustainable and certified manner as a way of claiming things done right. We fully respect the policies that protect our environment and our labour rights. We only manufacture timeless and long-lasting products fairly produced.  AWARENESS AND BEING SMARTThe Spanish saying goes: «lo barato sale caro». Meaning that buying cheap is expensive. Whenever you are buying any kind of low-cost and low-quality product you are doing it at the expense of the planet, its labourers health and at the expense of your own pocket, because rather soon than later you would have to replace the product. Low-cost products are not only transient but also thrive at the cost of slowly destroying craftsmanship and small traditionalbusinesses. It is a matter of awareness. Remember, remember: ‘Lo barato sale caro’.  DESIGNED IN BARCELONA, HANDCRAFTED IN ITALYWe value craftsmanship and dedication over productivity at any cost and senseless velocity. We believe in true rhythms and free flow. Our final product is the result of a research that balances creativity and integrity, innovation and clarity, quality and design.  ​​ At Nolands we want to lead a change in the optic industry towards greater sustainability. Nonetheless, our environment awareness and our corporate social responsibility go way beyond simple intentions. Our goal is to empower communities at risk of poverty, increase people’s well-being and to protect our most precious treasure: the planet. Hence for every pair of glasses we sell we carry out definite actions and campaigns.That is why this year we are focusing our efforts on one super appealing project.  REDUCING CARBON FOOTPRINT & BRINGING BACK WILDLIFEWe strive to reduce the carbon footprint by planting trees in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil for each glasses sold, collaborating hand in hand with WeForest & WWF. Helping to improve the native forest ecosystem devastated by fires and agricultural expansion, and also giving protection and care to wildlife injured by deforestation. We hope that with your help we can help plant more than 10,000 trees.We humbly want to contribute. Will you help us?    WARRANTY​:Our highly resistant lenses have a lifetime warranty and our bio frames a 5-year one.  SHIPPING:WORLDWIDE FREE SHIPPING INCLUDED IN ALL ORDERS AND COUNTRIES.Please check out the following duty information in case you have any doubt: Europe:Backers with a shipping address in any of these 27 countries will not have to pay any additional duties:Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden. Rest of the World:Backers from all other countries may have to pay additional import duties or other applicable taxes depending on the import policies of their respective countries upon receipt of their goods.Custom policies and tax rates vary from country to country and we are unable to help you determine that for your shipment.

To complete this landscape, the smoked glass and the triangular honeycomb, KLYNT signature, offer a discreet glance at the movement.Selecting the ""petite seconde"" movement enabled this incredible design, where keen observers can detect that the dial is shaped as KLYNT logo. Enjoying a solid reputation and used by Tag Heuer, Bulgari, IWC... our mechanical automatic movement is engraved, decorated with Côtes de Genève and finely set by our Watchmaker.Harmonious as a wholeEvery detail of the bracelet was carefully studied, from the different grains of leather, the lining with the stamped signature pattern, to the custom manly buckle.Stamped lining with the signature pattern on the strapTo complete the package, each timepiece will be packed in the original KLYNT ELEGANCE CONTEMPORAINE Box, adopting the visual codes of the collection.KLYNT BoxIf you want more pictures and videos of the collection, have a look at our Youtube, Facebook and Instagram!Diameter:          43,5 mm Lug to Lug:        50 mmThickness:         11,3 mm Strap width:       22 mm Weight :             96 g Movement:Swiss Mechanical automatic SW 290 31 Jewels - Frequency 28,800 vph (4 Hz) - Power reserve: 38 hours - Average rate: 7±7s/d set by our Watchmaker.Straps are genuine calf leather with suede lining, 22m wide and equipped with a fast release system to be easily interchangeable. To get additional straps with your watch, add USD 60 per strap to your pledge.  This Founders' Edition is limited to 500 pieces, each one individually numbered on the caseback.

Both coming from an engineering background, the founders were attracted by mechanical structures. Growing around Geneva’s Watchmakers, no surprise their hearts were falling for Haute Horlogerie pieces, for they are truly pushing the boundaries of technicity and presenting astonishing complications. Unfortunately, such timepieces were out of their reach, and the two friends could only afford the classic and sober mainstream watches.     KLYNT was born from their entrepreneurial motivation to remedy this lack of creativity, and for more people to access such exceptional timepieces. This was the starting point to create contemporary watches with unique designs the Swiss way.  Why adopting the name KLYNT? In reference to a Swedish artist Hilma af Klint, who at her time pioneered Contemporary Art to fully satisfy her passion for creativity.ELEGANCE CONTEMPORAINE Collection is the result of a year and a half of work, on the design, development and supply chain set up. We are now fully ready to unlock production with your support!It's time to thank you all for your amazing support you expressed all along the project. For the advices, for your honest feedback to improve the prototypes, and for your enthusiasm when wearing the watches! Thank you to Studio Divine for their hard word and nice pictures, as well as Balázs Ferenczi for your great photos!",45.0,0,"1 Campaign

You don’t have to fear anymore while riding on a crowded bus, train or subway, or while standing in a queue close to other people.The crooks of today don't have to be very intelligent or dexterous - all they have to do is stand near you to steal precious data from your credit cards. Luckily, this is where Wiseward jumps in. You see, the RFID chips embedded in your cards work by using radio waves to communicate, and that's what makes it possible to read them without actual physical contact. But, that also means that someone with a skimmer device can easily scan through your pocket, without you realizing it.  Fortunately, radio waves can be interrupted and blocked, and that’s exactly how Wiseward Essential wallet works: it encases your credit cards in a material that interferes with radio waves. No radio waves – no skimming; you don't have to fear anymore while riding on a crowded bus, train or subway, or while standing in a queue close to other people.  To make things more practical, Wiseward Essential has special two-zone card sections: one with RFID protection, and the other without protection. The section without RFID protection enables you to use the cards that must stay unblocked all the time - so you don't have to pull them out of the wallet if you want to open your garage, enter a subway station etc. Go for practicality. Wiseward Essential features practical minimalist design, well organized interior with two internal pockets that allow you for more storage space, and handy external pocket for quick access. It also comes in a wide choice of nicely balanced two and three tone colour combinations.  Due to the design of its compartments, it's only 0.4"" (10 mm) thick when filled optimally (10 cards and cash).Wiseward Essential can hold up to 10 credit cards in two RFID protected sections, plus up to 6 cards in two internal pockets, intended for non-protected cards. The section without RFID protection enables you to use cards that must stay unblocked all the time - so you don't have to pull them out of the wallet if you want to open the garage, enter the subway station etc.Wiseward Essential can receive up to 15 credit cards and still remain slim, pocket-sized and easy to use. Carry it with pride. Wiseward Essential is designed and manufactured in the EU by an award winning product design team, skillfully made using first class materials and combining simplicity with good looks. Baggizmo Wiseward Essential has been designed in Croatia and is completely made in Europe. Personalize your Baggizmo Wiseward Essential.Engrave your wallet with up to three letters of Alphabet, and create a unique gift that anyone would be proud to carry.    Baggizmo Wiseward Essential wallet is available in 8 different color combinations and in two different patterns.  Baggizmo Wiseward Essential - Pumpkin Vintage BrownVintage brown tweed pattern material on the outside, smooth matt chocolate brown material on the inside with orange smooth external pocket. Baggizmo Wiseward Essential - True BlueMinimalistic true blue diamond shaped pattern material on the outside and  smooth matt mint green material on the inside with smooth green mint external pocket Baggizmo Wiseward Essential - Cardinal RedMinimalistic cardinal red diamond shaped pattern material on the outside and smooth matt ivory beige material on the inside with smooth matt ivory beige external pocket Baggizmo Wiseward Essential - Jet BlackMinimalistic jet black diamond shaped pattern material on the outside and smooth matt jet black material on the inside with smooth matt jet black external pocket. Baggizmo Wiseward Essential - Noble BlueNoble blue tweed pattern material on the outside and smooth matt midnight blue material on the inside with smooth matt midnight blue external pocket Baggizmo Wiseward Essential - Sandy BeigeSandy beige tweed pattern material on the outside and smooth matt ivory beige material on the inside with smooth matt ivory beige external pocket Baggizmo Wiseward Essential - Vintage BrownVintage brown tweed pattern material on the outside and smooth matt chocolate brown material on the inside with smooth matt chocolate brown  external pocket. Baggizmo Wiseward Essential - Limited EditionMinimalistic true blue diamond shaped pattern material on the outside and smooth matt gray material on the inside with smooth matt gray external pocket. Baggizmo Wiseward Essential wallet is packed in a sleek, black envelope and placed into electrostatic semi transparent envelope bag with a zipper  Baggizmo Wiseward Essential gift packaging is an elegant textile packaging bag like is often used for storing exclusive gift items.

They are guided by the philosophy that the design shouldn’t be dictated by seasons or trends; instead, it should be practical, comfortable and innovative. The entire Baggizmo team has been driven by this idea and this vision and it has resulted in the successive production of well-received wearable gadgets.Baggizmo team members:Ladislav Jurić _ Founder, CEO, product development managerIzvorka Jurić _ Product development and branding managerTomislav Petković _ Prototype developmentIgor Poturić _ Creative communication, copywritingMatija Tolić _ Website development and tech supportMarina Ravlić _ Baggizmo Project ManagerDinka Hadžović _ Operation and logistics associateKristina Ravlić _ Social network marketing, assistant and customer supportJurica Kos _ Graphic design and visual presentationand others who helped us in many ways.We would like to thank the whole team for their effort and enthusiasm.  Baggizmo® is a wearable tech-fashion brand that includes a unique EDC bag and technologically the most advanced smart wallet - Wiseward™, that was born from a great vision of innovative and practical design.After the successful Kickstarter campaign in 2015, Baggizmo® become the name on everyone’s lips.

</h3>

<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Jason wanted something cool and functional. Suzie and Peggy wanted a case that is fashionable to match their clothes. So Jason bought a £26 durable-looking case, Suzie got a £40 branded rubber-made case while Peggy customised hers within a £20 budget. Merely a week after, they got bored with these “one-timer” and wonder why they need to get a new case to give their phones a different.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Why can’t we have one that’s modifiable to be unique, irreplaceable and yet exclusive? The bottom line is: <u>Why can’t we have ONE that fits all?</u></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">From there, they know exactly what the people needs but lacks of. They know fashion and trends never stop changing. ""We want to create a multipurpose platform that suits all men &amp; women!"".</span></p>
<p><b>And the journey began...</b></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Upon graduating from Manchester Metropolitan University, the creators were nervous yet excited. They want to make this vision comes true using all the knowledge gained from their Masters.</span></p>
<p>It is not easy to create a new platform that allows jewellery and functional accessories attached to the oh-so-common smartphone- the iPhone. Different ideas came and went. Every possible considerations and aspects were looked into to make sure that they have given their best.</p>

A phone is not merely just a phone. It is no
longer a functional device to just make and receive calls. Ironically, it is not
bound to what an almighty smartphone is capable of doing. A phone is more than
that. 
A phone is a fashion statement.  

Meet HOST and CHARISM- the perfect duo that blends innovation and fashion.


HOST is a platform that houses CHARISM; a iPhone HOST is a phone case that will hold charms using patent pending magnetic
twist to lock.  It’s time to get
notice!


















iPhone Host : The Sleek iPhone Case


iPhone HOST is a
fine piece uniting 1.5mm thin bumper with 2.5mm magnetic slide
platform. The 1.5mm neodymium
magnet is mounted firmly on the 0.5mm stainless steel plate at the back of the
case that will not disrupt the built-in compass. 
iPhone HOST is also designed to ensure its compatibility
with iPhone 5s dual LED flash light through its precise measurement for a
camera window. The side buttons come with rubber extension for easy access to
the volume & power buttons. 
iPhone HOST is made of High Grade Polycarbonate and Anodised Stainless Steel with UV & Scratch Resistance coating.

CHARISM : More Than Just a Charm





CHARISM is the line of charms that will attach to HOST with a patent pending magnetic twist to lock. CHARISM - the name is a combination of our company’s name, Charis with charms. CHARISM also means the ‘gift of God’.
We at CharisCalais Limited aim to create fashionable and creative CHARISM with great flexibility to attach to HOST in any way you like.






                                             THE CHARISM STAND TOOLS

The BiG ""Ta-Da"": So how did the idea come along?

""GET AN AWESOME IPHONE CASE!"" That was what came to the creators’ minds when Jason, Suzie and Peggy first got their iPhone 5.
Jason wanted something cool and functional. Suzie and Peggy wanted a case that is fashionable to match their clothes. So Jason bought a £26 durable-looking case, Suzie got a £40 branded rubber-made case while Peggy customised hers within a £20 budget. Merely a week after, they got bored with these “one-timer” and wonder why they need to get a new case to give their phones a different.
Why can’t we have one that’s modifiable to be unique, irreplaceable and yet exclusive? The bottom line is: Why can’t we have ONE that fits all?
From there, they know exactly what the people needs but lacks of. They know fashion and trends never stop changing. ""We want to create a multipurpose platform that suits all men & women!"".
And the journey began...
Upon graduating from Manchester Metropolitan University, the creators were nervous yet excited. They want to make this vision comes true using all the knowledge gained from their Masters.
It is not easy to create a new platform that allows jewellery and functional accessories attached to the oh-so-common smartphone- the iPhone. Different ideas came and went. Every possible considerations and aspects were looked into to make sure that they have given their best.
The video above is the N's prototypes that the team had produced. It is by far the best yet!








PERKS : Some humble return from us 








Project Milestone : Where are we now?




Stretch goals: We wish to offer more!

We are also the only reflective backpack in the world created with cordura fabric.  FashionableAll reflective backpacks only allow a silver or gray color line because they coat their reflectivity with aluminum coating. LetMeLight, however, collaborates with cordura fabric to produce retro-reflective fabric utilizing the patented coating technology. INNO10 can make backpacks of any color with this special technology.(This version will only include a black color; however, we plan on manufacturing different colors for future campaigns based on backers' feedback and comments.)  ComfortableExperience breathability on a backpack like never before because the retro-reflective has premium air permeability--something that normal reflective tape does not have.  Easily AccessibleWith various pockets and multiple functions, you can easily access any of your items in LetMeLight while maintaining a simplistic and minimal design.   Retro-reflection is the reflection that reflects light back to its source with a minimum of scattering.By using a special printing technology, INNO10 was able to coat the glass beads directly on top of the fabric and film to create retro-reflectivity. Unlike most other reflective fabrics, INNO10's unique printing technology coats the glass beads directly on top of the fabric--something that no other company can do. Thanks to this technology, INNO10's retro-reflective fabric is highly breathable and can be used in apparel products as well.  The mirrored side of the countless glass beads inserted into the fiber tissue reflects it directly as a light source.    Most reflective fabric uses a reflective tape (3M) or film and it is applied to the garment or backpack. During the day, the tape can be visibly seen, and it can be visually unappealing. Also, this type of reflection can only be produced in a silver colorway. The type of fabric that can be used to produce this reflective technology is also very limited.  On the other hand, retro-reflective fabric by INNO10 is applied onto the entire backpack. It can function as a completely normal appearing backpack during the day, then transform into a highly reflective backpack at night. Our retro-reflective fabric can also be produced in many different colors and still exhibit the same level of retro reflection.  Because we are directly applying it on fabric, we are able to produce high quality breathable and washable apparel as well.   Reflective vs. Retro-Reflective Direct Comparison   Everyone is looking to pack their desired products, but no one enjoys a bulky backpack. With multiple pockets and wide space, LetMeLight will fit whatever you desire without it looking overwhelmingly bulky. Easy Access Laptop & Tablet PocketYou can fit up to a 13 inch laptop and seal it shut with the velcro seal to ensure maximum protection for your electronic goods.  OrganizationLetMeLight has amazing organization options with plenty of extra pockets in each area of the backpack to ensure the most optimal space for our wearers. We experimented and tested the design for months to achieve the most ideal configuration that will get our users the most out of these pockets.  Nylon ZipperThe usage of Nylon zippers makes the backpack stronger than ever--you don’t have to worry about the zippers ever becoming a problem.  High Quality Water Bottle PocketsTwo mesh water bottle pockets have been added to carry around any water bottle or tumbler of your choice. You can even use it to carry around your umbrella.  Compression Strap OR Strap for Extra Gear--You ChooseCompression straps to help make your backpack less bulky and can also be used as an attachment to any bulky item you want to carry around.  Adjustable Sternum Chest StrapNo matter how big or small you are, the adjustable sternum strap makes it easy to maximize your comfort while wearing LetMeLight.  Ergonomically Designed Back & Shoulder StrapsThe soft yet comfortable foam in the back keeps your back cool and dry while wearing LetMeLight at all times. The shoulder strap was also ergonomically designed to allow maximum comfort while wearing the backpack.  Unisex DesignLetMeLight was designed for both genders, so anybody can rock LetMeLight--literally!    LetMeLight wasn’t created with simply any type of fabric. It was created with the highest quality cordura fabric, and we can boast saying we are the world’s first and only backpack to use Cordura fabric and make it retro-reflective. Benefits of Cordura FabricCordura is approximately… 
Ten times more durable than cotton fabric
Three times more durable than polyester fabric
Two times more durable than nylon fabric
Cordura fabric is 25% lighter than polyester fabric.
Cordura fabric is water-resistant and does not change colors.
Cordura is a synthetic material, so it’s built to last with its high tensile strength fibers and will withstand long term wear.

<p>It takes quite a long time to break a belt in properly, to mold it to your body and have it develop a patina.</p>
<p>If you've ever had something for a long time, you know how attached you get to this kind of item. Some of these belts, I wore every day for years and when they broke I was devastated.</p>
<p>Most belts I found in shops seem to either be made of plastic or intended for a rodeo.</p>
<p>After going through too many belt shaped atrocities to keep track of I had enough and didn't want another belt to just hang in the closet or go with that one pair of shoes I have.</p>
<p>I wanted The belt. The one belt to rule them all.</p>

<p>I hit google and started looking for someone who could help me get my idea out of my head and onto my hips.</p>
<p>I live in Vienna, Austria and luckily we still have some amazing traditional workshops here that make beautiful handmade goods.</p>
<p>I spoke to dozens of people until I found Thomas. He is the young and passionate head of <a href=""http://www.karlinger.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>Karlinger</b></a>, a traditional leather workshop that feels like it belongs to a different age.</p>

<p>We adopted the indented lines and the folded back part of the Swedish army belt but changed the layout and outline of the belt to better fit our vision. The curved tip mirrors the bottom of the Tinker logo and the additional belt holes give you more flexibility when choosing a size.<br/></p>
<p>The undyed leather is extremely important because it allows you to create the look of the belt while wearing it.</p>

<p><b>The leather is going to change dramatically</b> over the lifetime of the belt and go from the initial sand color all the way to a deep brown. Just a couple of weeks wearing it will change it to a warm honey color.</p>
<p>But since it’s yours, you decide if that is what you want. Experiment: take some leather milk, beeswax or boot-fat and it becomes a different belt immediately.</p>
<p>We are going to include a piece of scrap leather with every belt so you can try your hand at dying, carving or painting the leather to your hearts content.</p>
<p>Since the <b>buckle and screws are removable</b> they won’t get in the way of your creative efforts and can of course be replaced with different ones if you so choose.</p>
<p>We designed it to last longer than the average lifespan so that your story, the life lived and embedded in the belt, lives on.</p>
<p><b style=""background-color: initial;"">We are making a belt that you can be proud of, that you would choose over any other belt out there and that you will enjoy wearing every day.</b></p>
<p>This belt is made to be a companion, a record, a heirloom and a gift.</p>
<blockquote><b>We are adventurers and we like to share our stories. Whether it's time you slapped a T-Rex or when you had to deal with a more urban threat like the common bouncer.

<p><b>The Tinkerbelt is made from full grain vegetable-tanned leather.</b></p>The process of tanning leather with vegetable tannins is a tradition that has been passed down from generation to generation of leather craftsmen. It is the classical method that gives the most beautiful results as it gives the leather unique characteristics. The tanning takes place in wooden drums, at a slow pace that allows the natural tanning acids found, in tree barks and leaves, to give the leather its warm light-brown hue, and a natural, woody smell.<br/><br/><p>In comparison to the other two popular tanning methods, which make use of harsh chemicals such as chromium and aldehyde, the vegetable tanning process takes considerably longer. While the other two methods take only one or  two days, the veg-tanning takes months (sometimes as long as one year) but is an environment-friendly method and the result is a beautiful, all-natural leather.</p>

<p><b>The 4mm thick full grain leather</b> ensures that this belt will outlast any other belt you may have in your closet. Full grain refers to leather that has not been sanded, buffed, or snuffed to remove natural marks on the surface of the hide. The grain that remains gives the fibers strength and durability. This also means the leather is more resistant to moisture, as the grain allows it to breathe.</p>

<h4>Ein besserer Gürtel</h4>
<p><span>Ich habe in meinem Leben einige Gürtel gehabt die ich wirklich geliebt habe und sie haben mir alle irgendwann das Herz gebrochen als sie auseinander gefallen sind. Egal ob die Nähte geplatzt sind oder die Schlaufen sich verabschiedet haben, ich immer sehr enttäuscht.</span></p>
<p>Es dauert ziemlich lange einen Gürtel richtig einzutragen, bis er sich deinem Körper anpasst und eine schöne Patina entwickelt.</p>
<p>Wenn du jemals etwas für lange Zeit in deinem Leben hattest dann weißt du wie sehr man, am Schluss, an diesen Gegenständen hängt.</p>
<p>Die meisten Gürtel die ich in Geschäften gefunden habe waren entweder aus Plastik oder sahen aus als ob Sie fürs Rodeo gedacht waren.</p>
<p>Nachdem ich mich durch unzählige Furcht erregende Gürtelatrappen gekämpft habe, hatte ich endlich genug. Ich will nicht noch einen Gürtel zum in den Schrank hängen oder der zu dem einen Paar Schuhe passt.</p>
<p>Ich will DEN GÜRTEL! </p>Den einen Gürtel auf den ich mich verlassen kann und der mich immer begleitet.<div>

<h2>DAS DESIGN</h2>
<p></p>
<p><span>Wir haben die seitlichen Linien und die umgeschlagene Schnallenhalterung des schwedischen Armee Gürtels übernommen aber das restliche Layout angepasst.</span></p>
<p>Die geschwungene Spitze spiegelt den unteren teil des Tinkerlogo wieder und die zusätzlichen Gürtellöcher geben dir mehr flexibilität bei der Größen Auswahl.</p>
<p>Das ungefärbte leder ist sehr wichtig weil es dafür sorgt das DU dem Gürtel den letzten Schliff gibst.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Dieser Gürtel ist nicht für jeden das richtige, du bekommst den Gürtel Roh und indem du ihn trägst, machst du ihn zu deinem Einzelstück.</span></p>
<p>Die Patina und Kratzer jedes Gürtels werden Einzigartig sein.<br/></p>
<p>Wir könnten eine gefärbte Version anbieten um mehr Gürtel zu verkaufen aber das wäre nicht der Gürtel den wir machen wollen.</p>
<p><b style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">Du vollendest den Gürtel indem du ihn trägst.</b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436216217/r48ykkjqgwxu5m5ynja0.jpg"" src="""" style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""/><br/></p>
<br/><p><b></b></p>
<p><b>Das Leder wird sich über die Lebzeit des Gürtels dramatisch verändern.</b></p>
<p>Die Farbe die zu Beginn an Wüstensand erinnert wird zuerst immer dünklere Honigtöne annehmen und in den folgenden Jahren ein immer tieferes Braun.</p>
<p>Aber da es dein Gürtel ist, entscheidest du was du mit dem Gürtel machen willst. Du kannst experimentieren: Nimm ein bisschen Ledermilch, Bienenwachs oder Stiefel Fett und es ist sofort ein ganz anderer Gürtel.</p>
<p>Damit ihr ohne gleich den Gürtel zu verändern, experimentieren könnt, werden wir zu jedem Gürtel ein Stück Restleder dazu packen an dem ihr das Färben und Schnitzen ausprobieren könnt.</p>
<p>Da ihr die Schnalle und Buchschrauben, die wir anstatt fixer Nieten verwenden, jederzeit entfernen und austauschen könnt, störten sie euch so bei eurer kreativen Arbeit auch nicht.</p>
<p><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Wir haben den Gürtel so konstruiert dass er länger hält als der durchschnittliche Mensch, damit deine Geschichte, das Leben das auf dem Gürtel aufgezeichnet wurde, weiter lebt.</i><br/></p>

<p><b><span>Wir wollen einen Gürtel auf den wir Stolz sein können, den wir jedem anderen Gürtel vorziehen und den es Spaß macht jeden Tag zu tragen.</span></b></p>

A better beltI've had several belts in my life that I've loved and all of them have broken my heart when they fell apart. Seams popped, belt-loops fell off. I was a sad puppy.
It takes quite a long time to break a belt in properly, to mold it to your body and have it develop a patina.
If you've ever had something for a long time, you know how attached you get to this kind of item. Some of these belts, I wore every day for years and when they broke I was devastated.
Most belts I found in shops seem to either be made of plastic or intended for a rodeo.
After going through too many belt shaped atrocities to keep track of I had enough and didn't want another belt to just hang in the closet or go with that one pair of shoes I have.
I wanted The belt. The one belt to rule them all.


How cool is it to still have your grandfather's military jacket or his amazing tools? We love those things because they come with a story.

How we built the Tinkerbelt
It took me a long time but in the end I found an old Swedish army belt, that had been lying in someone's basement since World War II.
It wasn't perfect but it served as the inspiration to build something truly awesome.
I hit google and started looking for someone who could help me get my idea out of my head and onto my hips.
I live in Vienna, Austria and luckily we still have some amazing traditional workshops here that make beautiful handmade goods.
I spoke to dozens of people until I found Thomas. He is the young and passionate head of Karlinger, a traditional leather workshop that feels like it belongs to a different age.



Karlinger has been making suspenders and belts for over 60 years and Thomas as the young successor of this esteemed legacy has been instrumental in bringing the Tinkerbelt to life.



THE DESIGN
We adopted the indented lines and the folded back part of the Swedish army belt but changed the layout and outline of the belt to better fit our vision. The curved tip mirrors the bottom of the Tinker logo and the additional belt holes give you more flexibility when choosing a size.
The undyed leather is extremely important because it allows you to create the look of the belt while wearing it.
The patina and scratches are going to be uniquely yours and the belt will tell your story.
This belt isn't right for everyone, it comes to you raw and changes with wear.

We could offer a dyed version to appeal to more people but we won't because this is the belt we wanted to make.

You finish it by wearing it.





The leather is going to change dramatically over the lifetime of the belt and go from the initial sand color all the way to a deep brown. Just a couple of weeks wearing it will change it to a warm honey color.
But since it’s yours, you decide if that is what you want. Experiment: take some leather milk, beeswax or boot-fat and it becomes a different belt immediately.
We are going to include a piece of scrap leather with every belt so you can try your hand at dying, carving or painting the leather to your hearts content.
Since the buckle and screws are removable they won’t get in the way of your creative efforts and can of course be replaced with different ones if you so choose.
We designed it to last longer than the average lifespan so that your story, the life lived and embedded in the belt, lives on.
We are making a belt that you can be proud of, that you would choose over any other belt out there and that you will enjoy wearing every day.
This belt is made to be a companion, a record, a heirloom and a gift.
We are adventurers and we like to share our stories. Whether it's time you slapped a T-Rex or when you had to deal with a more urban threat like the common bouncer. The marks on your belt will be the record of your life. Your autobiography will be holding your pants up.
We have the prototypes and they're amazing but now we need your help to fund the first real production run.




THE LEATHER



The Tinkerbelt is made from full grain vegetable-tanned leather.The process of tanning leather with vegetable tannins is a tradition that has been passed down from generation to generation of leather craftsmen. It is the classical method that gives the most beautiful results as it gives the leather unique characteristics. The tanning takes place in wooden drums, at a slow pace that allows the natural tanning acids found, in tree barks and leaves, to give the leather its warm light-brown hue, and a natural, woody smell.In comparison to the other two popular tanning methods, which make use of harsh chemicals such as chromium and aldehyde, the vegetable tanning process takes considerably longer. While the other two methods take only one or  two days, the veg-tanning takes months (sometimes as long as one year) but is an environment-friendly method and the result is a beautiful, all-natural leather.



The 4mm thick full grain leather ensures that this belt will outlast any other belt you may have in your closet. Full grain refers to leather that has not been sanded, buffed, or snuffed to remove natural marks on the surface of the hide. The grain that remains gives the fibers strength and durability. This also means the leather is more resistant to moisture, as the grain allows it to breathe.
The natural, warm toned leather makes for the ideal material for any long lasting accessory. Rather than getting worn out, it develops an amazing patina and looks better with age.
This leather does have some disadvantages, the top two being the long production time and the high price but the benefits far outweigh the costs and make it clearly the best choice.



These two images, found at www.leathermilk.com, show how beautiful  veg tan leather gets with age and use.
SIZING




The Tinkerbelt will be available in the sizes 85cm, 90cm, 95cm, 100cm, 105cm, 110cm, 115cm. Measured from the middle hole to the buckle.
Most peoples body changes over the years and I know from experience that I’m no exception. So if we are going to make a belt that lasts for a lifetime, we have to account for those changes in the design of the belt. That is why the Tinkerbelt has 10 belt holes instead of the usual 5-7. We want you to be able to actually wear it as long as it lasts. With 10 holes you have some extra leeway up and down.
Measure your waist or your belt from the most used hole to the middle of the buckle and pick the right belt from our sizing chart.
(Everyone who chose one or more Tinkerbelts as their reward will be asked what size or sizes they want after the campaign has ended.)
WHAT WE WILL DO WITH YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS
With a successfully funded campaign we have enough money to afford our first real production run of the Tinkerbelt. We can order the screws, buckles and leather we need for the first order and pay Thomas and his Team at Karlinger who have so far been working for free.It’s going to take several weeks for the leather and buckles to arrive so we can start to make the belts. That's why we’re very eager to get going as fast as possible.
The first production belts will be shipped directly to you, our Indiegogo Backers, as soon as they are ready.
OUR 100 YEAR GUARANTEE

We did everything we could think of to make sure this is the last belt you will ever need or want.
In fact we are so sure of it’s lasting power that we will replace any belt that doesn’t last at least 100 years of regular use.
As long as you use it for its intended purpose, as a belt, we will replace any Tinkerbelt that doesn't last at least 100 Years.
REWARDS
Here’s the loot my friends.First and foremost we are offering the Tinkerbelt that you guys are helping us bring to life as rewards. As a thank your for your support Indiegogo backers are able to get the Tinkerbelt an average discount of 40€ per belt compared to the post campaign price.

Ich habe in meinem Leben einige Gürtel gehabt die ich wirklich geliebt habe und sie haben mir alle irgendwann das Herz gebrochen als sie auseinander gefallen sind. Egal ob die Nähte geplatzt sind oder die Schlaufen sich verabschiedet haben, ich immer sehr enttäuscht.
Es dauert ziemlich lange einen Gürtel richtig einzutragen, bis er sich deinem Körper anpasst und eine schöne Patina entwickelt.
Wenn du jemals etwas für lange Zeit in deinem Leben hattest dann weißt du wie sehr man, am Schluss, an diesen Gegenständen hängt.
Die meisten Gürtel die ich in Geschäften gefunden habe waren entweder aus Plastik oder sahen aus als ob Sie fürs Rodeo gedacht waren.
Nachdem ich mich durch unzählige Furcht erregende Gürtelatrappen gekämpft habe, hatte ich endlich genug. Ich will nicht noch einen Gürtel zum in den Schrank hängen oder der zu dem einen Paar Schuhe passt.
Ich will DEN GÜRTEL! Den einen Gürtel auf den ich mich verlassen kann und der mich immer begleitet.


Wie cool ist es immer noch die Armee Jacke oder das Werkzeug von deinem Großvater zu haben? Wir lieben diese Sachen weil sie eine Geschichte haben.
Wie wir den Tinkerbelt gebaut haben
Es hat eine weile gedauert aber am Ende bin ich auf einen alten 2. Weltkriegsgürtel der schwedischen Armee gestossen.
Er war nicht perfekt aber er hat als Inspiration gedient um etwas wirklich großartiges zu bauen.

Ich habe mit Hilfe von Google angefangen nach jemandem zu suchen der mir dabei helfen kann diese Idee aus meinem Kopf und auf meine Hüfte zu bringen.
Ich wohne in Wien und zum Glück gibt es bei uns einige großartige, traditionelle Werkstätten die immer noch in Handarbeit wunderschöne Gegenstände herstellen.
Ich habe mit dutzende Menschen gesprochen bis ich Thomas gefunden habe.Er ist der junge und passionierte Kopf von Karlinger, einem unglaublichen, Traditionsbetrieb der den Eindruck vermittelt noch aus einer anderen Zeit zu kommen.



Karlinger macht seit über 60 Jahren Gürtel und Hosenträger und Thomas als der junge Nachfolger dieser großartigen Tradition war instrumental dabei unseren Gürtel Realität werden zu lassen.



DAS DESIGN

Wir haben die seitlichen Linien und die umgeschlagene Schnallenhalterung des schwedischen Armee Gürtels übernommen aber das restliche Layout angepasst.
Die geschwungene Spitze spiegelt den unteren teil des Tinkerlogo wieder und die zusätzlichen Gürtellöcher geben dir mehr flexibilität bei der Größen Auswahl.
Das ungefärbte leder ist sehr wichtig weil es dafür sorgt das DU dem Gürtel den letzten Schliff gibst.

Dieser Gürtel ist nicht für jeden das richtige, du bekommst den Gürtel Roh und indem du ihn trägst, machst du ihn zu deinem Einzelstück.
Die Patina und Kratzer jedes Gürtels werden Einzigartig sein.
Wir könnten eine gefärbte Version anbieten um mehr Gürtel zu verkaufen aber das wäre nicht der Gürtel den wir machen wollen.
Du vollendest den Gürtel indem du ihn trägst.

Das Leder wird sich über die Lebzeit des Gürtels dramatisch verändern.
Die Farbe die zu Beginn an Wüstensand erinnert wird zuerst immer dünklere Honigtöne annehmen und in den folgenden Jahren ein immer tieferes Braun.
Aber da es dein Gürtel ist, entscheidest du was du mit dem Gürtel machen willst. Du kannst experimentieren: Nimm ein bisschen Ledermilch, Bienenwachs oder Stiefel Fett und es ist sofort ein ganz anderer Gürtel.
Damit ihr ohne gleich den Gürtel zu verändern, experimentieren könnt, werden wir zu jedem Gürtel ein Stück Restleder dazu packen an dem ihr das Färben und Schnitzen ausprobieren könnt.
Da ihr die Schnalle und Buchschrauben, die wir anstatt fixer Nieten verwenden, jederzeit entfernen und austauschen könnt, störten sie euch so bei eurer kreativen Arbeit auch nicht.
Wir haben den Gürtel so konstruiert dass er länger hält als der durchschnittliche Mensch, damit deine Geschichte, das Leben das auf dem Gürtel aufgezeichnet wurde, weiter lebt.
Dieser Gürtel wurde gemacht um ein Begleiter, eine Aufzeichnung und ein Geschenk zu sein.
Wir sind Abenteurer und wir teilen gerne unsere Geschichten. Egal ob es die Geschichte ist von damals als du dem T-Rex eine verpasst hast oder doch die vom gemeinen Türsteher, die Spuren auf deinem Gürtel sind die Geschichte deines Lebens. Deine Autobiographie hält deine Hose fest.
Wir wollen einen Gürtel auf den wir Stolz sein können, den wir jedem anderen Gürtel vorziehen und den es Spaß macht jeden Tag zu tragen.


Wir haben unsere Prototypen und sie sind großartig geworden aber jetzt brauchen wir eure Unterstützung um den nächsten Schritt machen zu können.

DAS LEDER


Der Tinkerbelt ist aus pflanzlich gegärbten Vollrind Leder.
Das pflanzliche Gerben ist eine sehr alte Tradition und diese klassische Methode bringt immer noch die besten Ergebnisse. Man bekommt ein einzigartiges Leder das mit chemie gegerbten Ledern einfach nicht zu Vergleichen ist.Das gerben passiert in Holzfäßern in denen die natürlichen Säuren von Baumrinde und Blättern dem Leder das helle Braun und einen tollen holzigen Geruch verleihen.Verglichen mit den zwei anderen populären Gerbungsarten die von starken Chemikalien wie Chromium und Aldehyd Gebrauch machen braucht das pflanzliche Gerben erheblich länger. Während die anderen Methoden nur ein oder zwei Tage brauchen, dauert das veg-tanning (pflanzliche gerben) Monate oder sogar bis zu einem Jahr. Die pflanzliche Methode ist dafür komplett Umweltfreundlich und das Resultat ist ein wunderschönes, komplett natürliches Leder.Das 4mm dicke Vollrind Leder sorgt dafür das der Tinkerbelt jeden deiner anderen Gürtel überleben sollte. Vollrind bedeuted das die Lederoberfläche weder geschliffen noch poliert wurde um die natürlichen Markierungen zu entfernen. Die intakte Oberfläche mit ihren Fassern sorgt für Stärke und Haltbarkeit. Ausserdem ist das Leder resistenter gegen Feuchtigkeit da es durch die Maserung besser atmet.
Das natürliche warme Leder ist ideal für lang haltbare Gegenstände. Anstatt kaputt zu werden entwickelt sich langsam eine unglaubliche Patina, die mit der Zeit nur noch besser wird.
Das Leder hat auch einige negative Punkte, unter anderem die lange Produktionszeit und der dadurch hohe Preis aber die vielen Vorteile überwiegen und machen es eindeutig zur besten Wahl.
FARB ENTWICKLUNG:


Diese Bilder, gefunden auf www.leathermilk.com, zeigen wie wunderschön pflanzlich gegerbtes Leder mit Zeit und Benutzung wird.
GRÖSSEN




Den Tinkerbelt Gürtel gibt es in den Größen: 85cm, 90cm, 95cm, 100cm, 105cm, 110cm, 115cm gemessen von der Mitte der Schnalle zum mittleren Loch.
Der Körper der meisten Menschen verändert sich über die Jahre und ich weiß aus Erfahrung das ich keine Ausnahme bin. Wenn ich also einen Gürtel bauen will der dich dein ganzes Leben begleiten soll muss ich diese Veränderungen auch mit einkalkulieren. 
Deswegen hat unser Gürtel nicht die üblichen 5-7 Gürtel Löcher sonder ganze 10. Wir wollen das du den Gürtel auch wirklich so lange tragen kannst wie er hält. Mit 10 Löchern hat man mehr Spielraum.
Miss deine Hüfte oder deinen alten Gürtel von der Mitte der Schnalle bis zum meist benutzten Loch und such dir mit Hilfe unserer Größentabelle den richtigen Gürtel aus.(Jeder der sich einen oder mehrere Tinkerbelt Gürtel als Belohnung ausgesucht hat wird nach dem Ende der Kampagne gefragt welche Größen gewünscht sind.)
WAS WIR MIT EURER UNTERSTÜTZUNG MACHEN


Mit einer Erfolgreich finanzierten Kampagne haben wir genug Kapital um in Produktion zu gehen.
Wir können Schrauben, Schnallen und Leder bestellen und Thomas und sein Team mit der Produktion beauftragen. Das ganze Karlinger Team hat uns bis jetzt gratis geholfen!
Die fertigen Gürtel werden zusammen mit den anderen Belohnungen direkt an euch, unsere Indiegogo Unterstützer versandt.
UNSERE 100 JAHR GARANTIE

Wir haben alles was uns eingefallen ist getan um sicherzustellen das der Tinkerbelt der letzte Gürtel ist den du brauchst oder willst.
Wir sind so überzeugt von diesem Gürtel das wir versprechen jeden Gürtel der nicht mindestens 100 Jahre normalen Gebrauch aushält, zu ersetzen.So lange er als Gürtel benutzt wurde, ersetzen wir jeden Tinkerbelt der nicht mindestens 100 Jahre hält.
BELOHNUNGEN

Hier sind die Schätze!
Als erstes und wichtigstes bieten wir den Tinkerbelt Gürtel den wir mit eurer Hilfe produzieren werden als Belohnung an. Hier auf Indiegogo gibt es den Gürtel für mindestens 40€ unter dem Preis für den wir ihn nach der Kampagne verkaufen werden.
Zusätzlich haben wir uns speziell für Indiegogo ein paar exklusive Belohnungen einfallen lassen: Die Tinker Geldtasche, den Tinker Schlüsselanhänger und den unglaublich coolen Tinker Gitarrengurt.

<h3>A LITTLE HISTORY FIRST</h3>
<p>Hi guys, my name is Paul Leadbeatter and I live in the North of England, United Kingdom.</p>
<p>I am a part time worker in a local supermarket and am starting this campaign to hopefully get my clothing label, BuiltByNerdz Clothing, off the ground.</p>
<p>Our facebook page has near 400 likes with more adds every day and we have already produced small numbers of t-shirts and beanies which sold relatively quickly, so we know we have a good fan base.</p>
<p>BuiltByNerdz has gamers at its heart but t-shirt designs for everyone can be found with us. Our designs are great and we know people will love to wear them.</p>
<p>It is extremely hard trying to juggle a small income and attempt to fund this lifelong dream of mine and this is where indiegogo comes in.  The sheer simplicity of creating a campaign and telling your story drew me in straight away.</p>
<p>Our page has the help of an awesome graphic designer and great clothing model. Both ready to put their talents to use.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>THE INS &amp; OUTS</h3>
<p>So the funding amount is £500 and is a very small sum in comparison to what we would get in return. The independent t-shirt market is popular and booming of late, with no sign of dieing down. And we believe we can make it big with a little help.</p>
<p>Here is what the £500 would do for us;</p>
<p>*A total of 75 t-shirts of various sizes and colours (probably white, red and navy blue colours) the 75 will be then split in to 3 batches of 25, with each batch having a seperate design, meaning 3 designs in total.</p>
<p>*20 Beanie hats with a single design in a mutitude of colours (probably 5 each of bottle green, burgundy, bolt gun grey and black)</p>
<p>*50 black silicon wristbands with a white embossed print on them.</p>
<p><br/>The entire funding ammount will be used to print our selection of ready designs on to a variety of coloured t-shirts, vests, beanies and silicon wrist bands.</p>
If the funding goal is not met then no money will be lost on your part.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if funding is something you would not like to do, then just a general shout out on facebook or where ever would be greatly appreciated as every little really does help. The more people to see this, the better!</p>
Also don't forget to use the indiegogo share tools :)</div>

It seems to me that silk is a subtle world and a universe, which is the closest to the soul. It is the same as the soul: there are a lot of unsolved mysteries and secrets. Silk is a field that I can trust my most sincerest and honest stories.</p><h2>Layout creation process.</h2><p>When some thought becomes so overwhelming that it is difficult to keep it in mind, the idea of a new collection appears.

This is a live format in which a lot of strangers were involved. I knew that the result would be unpredictable! ""Let it have its swing"" - I said to myself. The creation of the collection began with the question of my interest: ""What is happiness for you?"". Then everyone could answer it in the social networks. I chose the answer that I really liked: ""To love and to be loved"" - so said one of the participants of the project - Valeriia. After that, I illustrated my question and the answer of Valeriia. The next question was asked by Valeriia. And so on, one by one, until the entire plane of the first scarf was filled. For the second scarf as the basic question a short but very comprehensive question of Konstantine was chosen: ""Who are we?"". All interested persons could express their versions. In this case, I illustrated all the answers. So what's the main idea of the project? It's very simple ! It is important to interact with the world. But much more important in life, what is your inner dialogue: what questions you ask to yourself, and how you answer them.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506422807/nl0gy3feh6hmden9h4dq.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506422824/jeel5tzaiwqxp0oglvto.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506422871/pn8nh9d1qt2o5ivxwtsi.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506422887/p2lcmdduixyjrnxf6hse.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506422935/f4a9q3ex57glxr8ryj86.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3>3.

The work on the collection began with a thought about an egg or more precisely with a thought of its perfection and uniqueness. It comes as no surprise that it is a symbol of the Universe. That’s how the idea of creating outer space on silk appeared. Roosters inside the eggs symbolize the divine spark, which stands for the creative ability, which every person holds inside. It is the beginning under the influence of thought, which has its roots to action, creating new and unknown.

The natural silk product is better to wash with hands in the cool water without soaking, using special liquid detergents for silk care. Usual detergent and soap are harmful to silk products. Rinse your silk thing in the water of the same temperature. During drying silk thing you need to spread it out on a towel on a horizontal surface away from direct sunlight, heaters and lamps with fluorescent light. Silk should be ironed when it’s wet, on “Silk” mode and only on the reverse side of the product.

Each new collection is a separate story, which I want to share with people. This is my way of interacting with the world.Why silk? It seems to me that silk is a subtle world and a universe, which is the closest to the soul. It is the same as the soul: there are a lot of unsolved mysteries and secrets. Silk is a field that I can trust my most sincerest and honest stories.Layout creation process.When some thought becomes so overwhelming that it is difficult to keep it in mind, the idea of a new collection appears. Before creation of each silk story, I make a series of sketches, where I'm looking for the right images and a colour palette which will represent the mood and essence of the collection in the best way. After that I transfer the sketches into computer, modify and detail them. Then I create a layout, which is going to be printed. About collections.And now it is the high time to introduce you My Silk Story collections. Four silk stories have been embodied for the time being of the project.1. ""Interaction""It's a story about love and understanding. I wish that all of us learn to hear and feel the nature, to be close to it, to be a part of it. Animals, birds, plants and insects on the scarf are not selected randomly. All the characters of this story are included in the Red Book of Ukraine. They are a confirmation and a reminder of what can happen if we don't learn to appreciate the nature and live in harmony with it. Just being a single entity, we can be truly happy. Phrases in Latin, which are located on the perimeter of the scarf, emphasize the concept of the collection ""Interaction"". 2. ""Dialogue""It is a completely experimental collection. This is a live format in which a lot of strangers were involved. I knew that the result would be unpredictable! ""Let it have its swing"" - I said to myself. The creation of the collection began with the question of my interest: ""What is happiness for you?"". Then everyone could answer it in the social networks. I chose the answer that I really liked: ""To love and to be loved"" - so said one of the participants of the project - Valeriia. After that, I illustrated my question and the answer of Valeriia. The next question was asked by Valeriia. And so on, one by one, until the entire plane of the first scarf was filled. For the second scarf as the basic question a short but very comprehensive question of Konstantine was chosen: ""Who are we?"". All interested persons could express their versions. In this case, I illustrated all the answers. So what's the main idea of the project? It's very simple ! It is important to interact with the world. But much more important in life, what is your inner dialogue: what questions you ask to yourself, and how you answer them.3. ""Universe""""Universe"" collection is dedicated to 2017 Fire Rooster Year. The work on the collection began with a thought about an egg or more precisely with a thought of its perfection and uniqueness. It comes as no surprise that it is a symbol of the Universe. That’s how the idea of creating outer space on silk appeared. Roosters inside the eggs symbolize the divine spark, which stands for the creative ability, which every person holds inside. It is the beginning under the influence of thought, which has its roots to action, creating new and unknown. In consequence we have changes too. “True wisdom comes to each of us when we realize how little we understand about life, ourselves, and the world around us.” Socrates. 4. ""Another life""  Alongside with our lives there is always another reality, another life, where many amazing creatures and energies live. We can’t make an image of them, but due to this they are even more wonderful. Loftiness, fusion in a riot of colours and life is the condition which accompanied the creation of the collection. Everything around is not just alive and growing, it is a start to something new. One energy flows into the other and nothing disappears completely. It continues to live in its other performance, which we may not even suspect. “Another life is another you”.Characteristics.All shawls are made of 100% silk (Crepe satin, 54g/m2 density). Print is applied by Italian equipment, so the picture is of high detailing and quality.  All products are sewed with thin neat lock-stitch:Care of the pure silk products.Don’t wash silk things in a washing machine. The natural silk product is better to wash with hands in the cool water without soaking, using special liquid detergents for silk care. Usual detergent and soap are harmful to silk products. Rinse your silk thing in the water of the same temperature. During drying silk thing you need to spread it out on a towel on a horizontal surface away from direct sunlight, heaters and lamps with fluorescent light. Silk should be ironed when it’s wet, on “Silk” mode and only on the reverse side of the product. It is not recommended to moisten the dried silk cloth by spraying - drops of water can leave spots.Why do I need people’s support on Indiegogo?With your help, I want to start printing in larger editions than I am printing now. It will help me to reduce the prime cost of fabric and therefore the final cost of it (now it is quite high). Thus, the products of the project My silk story will be more accessible to people.And also I would like to create a website for My silk story project.What You GetAny of your help is very important!

</div></div>","The World's first bag & backpack with a galoshWe asked ourselves why bags and backpacks are designed for carrying only, when we know that 99% of the time they are left on the floor, leaning against a wall, a chair, or our feet.Fast forward one and a half year, we have designed a collection of bags and backpacks with an exchangeable silicone galosh that makes the bags stand up by themselves, protecting them from dirt and water, as well as giving them a cool and customized look. If the galosh gets worn out, it can easily be replaced while the bag stays fresh and clean.Underneath the galosh you'll see a map of Sagene in Oslo. This is where the idea of t|k was born.Key featuresThe Backpack CollectionThe Roll-top Backpack

<p><b>WHY EVERYWEAR?</b></p>
<p>In Thailand, more than 70,000 people live on wheelchair and more 40,000 people have a paralysis. They have many inconvenience in their lives. Many of them don't want to go out because of lacking facilities and assistants. </p>

</p>
<p>“Everywear”, a project which is supported prototype by Thai Social Enterprise Office, encourages wheelchair users to live their life with designing the cloth which suitable for their body and routine. The project starts by designing 2 special pants for wheelchair users with paralysis, as facilities, giving them easier to move, go out, and do their job. To test the business prototype  I have to get 2,500 USD to produce the first 100 pants and sell it in affordable price in online shop.</p>

EVERYWEAR vs Normal pantsWheelchair users with paralysis don't feel anything on lower body. They don't use toilet but they use urinary bag  with long rubber tube which obstruct them to move their body. Some normal pants is caused of pressure unclers and smelly. 
Looking is  important as  function, many wheelchair users concern about how do they look?. Most of normal pants,which they can wear, is old fashion and too loose. 
Everywear designs functions to serve wheelchair user's need. The pants is easy to wear by themselves, have a hidden pocket for urinary bag, usable pocket for wallet and mobile phone.  On Everywear pants, they look cool and fashionable.
 I make the pants and sent to disbility wheelchair users in Mahathai Foundation, one of disability foundation in Thailand. 100% of them want this pants and believe they will have better living with this pants. 

What's fund for?
I want to sell the pants in affordable price. 50% of the price will come from wheelchair users and 50% comes from donors. Because most of disabled people in Thailand have low income (The government give them only 15 USD /month/person.  ) So your funding will help me testing this model.

<h2>Pony Scarves</h2>
<p>Hey Everypony, we’re ready for round 2! Let’s make it even bigger and better than the first campaign. This time we’re featuring Pinkie Pie and Rarity. You may notice some small differences between this campaign and the last one. We were a little naïve in our expectations last time, and there were some miscalculations and some costs we never considered. This time around we’re more experienced and have a more realistic approach and outlook. There are going to be 3-4 separate campaigns over the next several months, each featuring 2 scarves.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3></h3></span><h2><span class=""notranlsate"">We need your help to make our dream a reality!</span></h2>
<p><span class=""notranlsate"">We have several scarf designs finished and ready to be made into physical scarves, funding is all we are missing. With the purchase of either the Pinkie Pie or Rarity scarf, you will be helping us fund the production. The more people we get to help back this project the more scarves we can have made.</span></p>

Hey Everypony, we’re ready for round 2! Let’s make it even bigger and better than the first campaign. This time we’re featuring Pinkie Pie and Rarity. You may notice some small differences between this campaign and the last one. We were a little naïve in our expectations last time, and there were some miscalculations and some costs we never considered. This time around we’re more experienced and have a more realistic approach and outlook. There are going to be 3-4 separate campaigns over the next several months, each featuring 2 scarves.



We need your help to make our dream a reality!
We have several scarf designs finished and ready to be made into physical scarves, funding is all we are missing. With the purchase of either the Pinkie Pie or Rarity scarf, you will be helping us fund the production. The more people we get to help back this project the more scarves we can have made.

Of course, you will find the same B3 “ice-blue” illumination here as well.We’ve always put our company’s future first, both by constantly learning of ways to improve and by investing in higher quality components and equipment. Finally, it was time for us to go fully Swiss by using the famous high-end work-horse, ETA 2824-2 Top Grade automatic movement.Movement and Rotor, a two-stage rocket that separates us from the competition.The movement has been regulated to top-tier accuracy and been equipped with our own, in-house designed rotor, presented in a trilogy of color treatments: rose-gold, stainless steel and chalk white. You will have as much time as you want to study the works of the movement thru the AR-coated sapphire crystal. Although a totally new design, the case has an iconic look to it. Robust, sporty, yet tastefully classy and perfectly suitable for your any day situations, both in durability and style. Made from sandblasted 316L stainless steel with carefully polished edges that run thru the case like the flow of water.The E.C.A. Calypso is made pressure proof to 10 atmospheres, 100m water depth, thanks to robust built, solid screw-down crown, and thick sapphire crystal glass on top and bottom of the case.The link between the lugs is our way to connect your watch to our current and future strap options. It not only looks appealing, the use of a connector link makes the strap sit far more secure than on a conventional watch, thanks to the deep spring bar cut and screw-in bar.Our own calf-leather straps come standard with your Calypso watch, and you have the option to choose between dark chestnut brown and black, (or both of course!), each having wide-grained alligator texture. The width of the strap is 25mm on top, narrowing down to 20mm on mid to bottom end.No fake stuffing here - our straps are made flat, mostly because it’s better looking, but also to prevent unnecessary foam stuffing. This makes for a slim and comfortable appearance, measuring 2.8mm, a figure specifically chosen to harmoniously fit the watch’s case.All straps are equipped with our uni-mold buckle of 316L stainless steel, with a polished base and rugged details below the elevated E.C.A. logo text and solid steel buckle pin.We promised our first customers to deliver a steel bracelet as an option to the Calypso watch, and of course, you will have the same opportunity. The bracelet is in production and will be ready along with the watch. The computer-rendering above illustrates how it will look.Solid-link steel bracelet. 316L sandblasted stainless steel base, polished mid-links, and beveled edges, all equipped with a folding deployment clasp. All preparations are made to ensure the steel bracelet is delivered along with your watch, if you chose this option.We care just as much for the watch’s inside as we do for the exterior. Simply, we are not content by the bare knowledge that our watches run correctly, we want detailed numbers of how the watch performs. That’s why we have set up our own performance center, where we measure amplitude, beats error, accuracy, magnetic and pressure resistance in detail. More importantly, we have the tools to perfect those attributes.When receiving your E.C.Andersson Calypso, there will be a direct transcript print-out from our Timegrapher inside the box. This will show you all detailed facts about accuracy and the well-being of your individual timepiece. Even if you don’t care right now, such information can be both exciting and soothing to have stored. Attached to the transcript is a description of all values, so you can learn more about them. We would never send a watch that doesn’t perform absolutely perfect.The packaging is a vital part of the experience, and of course, we designed the box ourselves as well. Made out of wood, coated in a matte deep-blue finish with silver powder and polished logotype, the box makes a perfect match to the E.C.A Calypso watch. Inside, you’ll find a white leather lining, a pouch for important attachment, such as manual, timegraph transcript and E.C.Andersson Club details. In center, of course, is your watch resting on a leather pillow, attached to a custom made hang-tag.We aim to be a respected, well-known name in the watch community. That means that everything we do has to be completely over-the-top professional. To us, a custom designed hang-tag dots the I’s and symbolizes that dedication, no matter how silly it may sound.The Hang-tag is your printed proof that the E.C.A. Calypso watch is protected by three full years of warranty. It also bears the name of our watches origin, Göteborg, where all development, testing and quality assurance is located.The base color of the tag is sandblasted in deep blue with an elevated text of polished silver finish, perfectly reflecting the Calypso dial.This is an opportunity for you to receive a true high-end watch that will last a lifetime, for a fraction of the price compared to competing brands in the segment, and for 35% less than future listing price starting June. Furthermore, your contribution will help us continue to be one of the few serious independent watch brands out there, and to an exciting future of watchmaking that includes. Funding goal has already been reached, meaning all risks are eliminated by the wonderful people who pledged for the earliest pre-orders. This means production has already begun and delivery is guaranteed to all customers. Our philosophy is simple and can be described in a single sentence:  Creating versatile watches with high quality, developed to endure all challenges, occasions, and environments in your daily life. Raised into a proud tradition of sailing, we strive to create watches that match both the harsh climate out at sea and the more formal, social environment once docked in harbor. A people’s brand, fitting most wallets, without compromising quality. Always mechanical automatic, made of durable materials with a progressive, yet sophisticated design.  Watches made to endure YouThe Scandinavian way of design is clean, sophisticated, functional and durable.

<p>Last summer, you would probably get stressed from socks that sagged and slipped down into your shoes under the scorching sun.  </p>
<p>You have probably have bought them because it was advertised as “Never-Slip""    </p>
<p>Why do we have to get stressed from such drooping, slipping socks?   </p> <p>Yes, we focused on a size of socks, as one of the reasons why no show socks slip off that easily. </p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1562855841/m52vnanqplugub0y1llr.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Most socks on the market are made as only one ""free size"" for all, no matter people have smaller or bigger feet.   </p>
<p>People have different shapes and sizes of feet. But does free size really fit all? </p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1562855883/tmr2wywmpts5ory8mwlm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our conclusion is, that free size actually does not fit all and therefore is not comfortable because of a lot of variables, like different shapes and sizes of feet, for example, big or small, wide or narrow. And slip also starts from this inconvenience.   </p>
<p>Then, can socks have varied sizes?</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1562855953/enud2exrusnblx6xov7q.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p> </p>
<p>We found most colors chosen for socks are simply black and white, in spite of a wide spectrum of colors available in the world.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1562858351/v6ptshxs6edzcvjtlxrw.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p> </p>
<p>High quality yarn goes through a knitting process to build an overall shape of sock with both ends open, and knitted socks pass to a sewing process to stitch up open side for toes. And after fabricating and toll processing, it becomes premium Non-slip G-SOCKS.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Hello from ORCHARD!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1563973445/fxpwsueqaet2mt7jl6bu.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>ORCHARD is a company established to design and make a variety of innovative items to improve inconveniences that we have just accepted into our daily lives without question.    </p>
<p>Under the motto ""Better Idea, Better Life"", we will design and make various products for advanced lifestyle.      </p>
</div></div>","After manufacturing G-SOCKS, we carried out various pretests targeting people with different feet sizes, and here are those reviews.
 

 

 
Last summer, you would probably get stressed from socks that sagged and slipped down into your shoes under the scorching sun.  
You have probably have bought them because it was advertised as “Never-Slip""    
Why do we have to get stressed from such drooping, slipping socks?    Yes, we focused on a size of socks, as one of the reasons why no show socks slip off that easily. 
 

 
Most socks on the market are made as only one ""free size"" for all, no matter people have smaller or bigger feet.   
People have different shapes and sizes of feet. But does free size really fit all? 
 

 
Our conclusion is, that free size actually does not fit all and therefore is not comfortable because of a lot of variables, like different shapes and sizes of feet, for example, big or small, wide or narrow. And slip also starts from this inconvenience.   
Then, can socks have varied sizes?
 

 
G-SOCKS will bring you comfort to your feet. Non-slip socks can be realized by comfort that only the right size for your own feet could bring.  
It is available in four different sizes and stylish unisex designs both for men and women, with the optimized wearability.
 

Now, what you have to do is just to choose your right sizes. And G-SOCKS will bring you comfort to your feet. The next step after choosing the right size is colors, 
 

 
 

 
 
We found most colors chosen for socks are simply black and white, in spite of a wide spectrum of colors available in the world.
 

 
Because black and white colors go well with any style of outfits, like suit and casual, and any style of shoes, such as dress shoes and sneakers, in any places.
 

 
 
However, you probably thought that all would have been fine if it didn't slip off, but...
Last summer, slip was not the only problem.
 

 
Many of you would have got stressed from socks that slide down into your shoes under the sizzling sun.
 

 
Or, you may have an experience to try to hide your big toe that pokes out of your sock when you have to take your shoes off.
Well, looking back on last summer brings us memories about so much stresses from socks that easily slide down and get holes.
 

 

 

 

 




 
What you have to do is just to choose your size and color, and G-SOCKS will handle the rest for you.
 

 

 
SILICONE GRIP
 

 
4 Silicone grips at the heel side to fix socks tightly and keep them in position while walking.
 
ELASTIC BANDING
 


 
Elastic band at the middle sole to prevent socks from slipping off and twisting.
 
DUAL BANDING
 

Dual band at the heel side to fix four silicone to the heels in order to prevent socks from slipping off.
 
THICKNESS & DURABILITY
 

 
G-SOCKS guarantees greater durability and wearability with any kind of shoes, like sneakers or dress shoes, as cotton yarn is used more than twice. 
 


 
 LOW CUT LINER
 

 
With a low cut design, it is not exposed beyond shoes, making you look cool and stylish.
 
SIZE INDICATION
 

 
Various sizes, S, M, L, and XL, marked in each sock for great wearability and convenience to easily match pairs of socks after washing.
 

 
NON-SLIP
G-SOCKS available in four different sizes, with advanced elastic bands, four silicone grips, and dual bands, will bring our supporters great comfort free from slipping down.
 

 
NO-SHOW
 

Low cut liner for cool summer style
 
WEARING SENSATION
 

 
Thanks to a great amount of breathable cotton yarn used, G-SOCKS is highly wearable with appropriate thickness and also absorbs sweat quickly.
 
UNISEX DESIGN
 

 

 
As an unisex design both for men and women, you choose just the right size for your feet, and experience the optimized comfort.
 
G-SOCKS MAKING STORY
 
G-SOCKS is made of the highest quality yarn, instead of easily destroyed inferior one.
 


 
High quality yarn goes through a knitting process to build an overall shape of sock with both ends open, and knitted socks pass to a sewing process to stitch up open side for toes. And after fabricating and toll processing, it becomes premium Non-slip G-SOCKS.

<h2>Our mission</h2>
<p>Where’s Mom was born from our dream about connectivity and a more sustainable fashion industry. We need new fashion standards to balance between fashion's overpriced prestige and underpaid workers. We're here to create quality products at the foundation of every family’s wardrobe. We specialise in one product in addition to do it really well and we want to embrace the connectivity between people with the printed patterns we design.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Where’s Mom's first collection</h3>
<p>We both have always been fascinated by the wonders and mysteries of Space. From the vast emptiness of the stars to the possibility of a rich alien life, there's so much to learn and appreciate about our Universe. We've found this to be a perfect metaphor to our desire. We want to connect with the world by discovering and creating the values of tomorrow’s fashion. </p>
<p>The patterns you see printed on our clothes are the result of unfolding our fantasy around the shapes and symbols of Space.</p>
<p>Shirts are essentials. Non seasonal clothes, made of breathable and sustainable fabrics for any kind of occasion. With the custom printed details you can distinctively  match your outfit with your friends or family members.</p>
<p>The collection contains:</p>

<h3>Where's Mom signature postcards</h3>

<p>Our postcards are also inspired by Space and are made of recycled paper.<br/>Find the right mood for your loved ones and sent them a fun and supportive message!<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488946767/unxjjusjygemugp5db8u.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2>Our story</h2>
<p>Where's Mom is made by two people. Dóra Kovács <i>(W)</i> is an award-winning fashion designer who after her experiences in both high and fast fashion brands decided to make a shift. Her dream of a more conscious and open-minded consumer culture starts by creating a brand that cares about sustainability issues and tries to deal with the toxic and wasteful routine that the fashion industry has.</p>
<p>Joining her is Miklós Esterházy <i>(M)</i> who brings his visual creativity to use with the patterns and postcards he designed for the collection and the videos he created.</p>
<p>Our campaign pictures were shot by Richárd Kovács who is a talented student of London School of Fashion. We were helped and advised by a lot of lovely people including Erika Szabó who is consulting with us about the business side of production and Attila Ács who made our brand visuals.</p>

<p><strong>Sourcing materials responsibly</strong></p>
<p>It was really difficult to find the right supplier. We had a lot of questions and sometimes we didn't get our answers. Finally we found an Italian company, who produces high quality shirt fabrics.

<p>We are working with a French company who helped us developing our sample collection for our campaign. They have a long history and a OEKO-TEX® certificate for printing materials.

<p>After the sample collection was made and was photographed we went on finding the company that can produce on a larger scale. When we decide on using a certain company we have an obligation and a responsibility to get to know their methods first. The cutting and sewing of our shirt are done in Hungary. We have the opportunity to go there in person and check the circumstances and also the quality of their work. Making one garment needs many people.

<h3>We see a problem and we want to fix it</h3>
<p>It’s not difficult to fall in love with a minimalist design. Science tells us that we see beauty in simple symmetry. The minimalist aesthetic is something that appeals to many. Here lies the problem.</p>
<p>You buy a nice watch. Your new watch attracts compliments and admiration from everyone. The problem is – it’s too easy to like. Before long, everyone else has one. You attend a party and there are than two people wearing the exact same watch. That’s not cool, and this happens all too often with popular brands.</p>
<p>Enter Anonymous Wares. <br/></p>
<h3>What we do differently</h3>
<p>If you’re reading this, you probably like
minimalist watches like we do. We want to change the rules of the watch scene.
We will work directly with independent designers to bring you new models
produced in limited production runs not exceeding 1000 pieces per model. Each
watch we produce will be serial-numbered so no two watches will ever be the
same. </p>

be versatile and classy with a minimalist feel. After months of design
revisions and sample production, we finally chose a reputable manufacturer to
produce our designs. Using many of the same (if not better) materials found in our

</div></div>","We see a problem and we want to fix it
It’s not difficult to fall in love with a minimalist design. Science tells us that we see beauty in simple symmetry. The minimalist aesthetic is something that appeals to many. Here lies the problem.
You buy a nice watch. Your new watch attracts compliments and admiration from everyone. The problem is – it’s too easy to like. Before long, everyone else has one. You attend a party and there are than two people wearing the exact same watch. That’s not cool, and this happens all too often with popular brands.
Enter Anonymous Wares. 
What we do differently
If you’re reading this, you probably like
minimalist watches like we do. We want to change the rules of the watch scene.
We will work directly with independent designers to bring you new models
produced in limited production runs not exceeding 1000 pieces per model. Each
watch we produce will be serial-numbered so no two watches will ever be the
same.

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Bespoke Style Braces - No Tailor Required</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p>Traditional suspenders, “braces” for the sartorially inclined, are like the Scotch of Style.</p>
<p>The way the leather transitions the linen straps to your waistband is timeless, but unless you have your own tailor you most likely think they’re reserved for A-list actors or high finance.</p>
<p>The suspenders you wore to your best friend’s wedding felt more like a novelty; cheap elastic and tacky metal clips shimmer while yanking up, awkwardly, on your waistband.  You certainly didn’t feel like Marlon Brando in “A Streetcar Named Desire.”</p>
<p>Stratton Suspender Company has bridged this gap between the timeless look of traditional button-on braces without the hassle of tailoring.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1614203130/qky3tw8sw2l0hveszskq.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Men's fashion accessories serve a purpose, they project confidence, competence, and personality; they are functional, functional to the narrative you tell about who you are before you even say a word.</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p>Stratton Suspender Co. uses a Patent Pending “Modular Twin-Magnetic Clasp System” to give the user the look of traditional button-on suspenders with the convenience of clips; yet with a comfort and versatility unmatched in history.</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li><i><strong>The magnets are more than strong enough, we could have gotten away with half the magnet clasps but it would not have that classic look.</strong></i></li>
<li><i><strong>Guaranteed to not come off or your money back.</strong></i></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>More than that, the modularity of Stratton Suspenders allows you to interchange different straps adding an entirely new dimension to men’s style.</p>

<h3>Stratton Suspenders - The Subtlety is Magnetic</h3>
<p>Traditional button-on suspenders appeal to a certain kind of man, the capable, confident, and in control.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1614203340/ykef01rokiiglhbwgb8e.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>The perfect intersection of form and function - Stratton Suspenders</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>This powerhouse accessory defines many of Hollywood’s most iconic roles.  So what is it about these classic suspenders that leave such an impression?</p>
<ul>
<li>Suspenders reinforce good posture, reminding the user to pull his shoulders back and down, opening the chest up for a more commanding and confident presence.</li>
<li>Suspenders streamline your torso making you appear taller, unlike a belt, which chops your torso in half.</li>
<li>Suits were never made for belts. The buckle at the opening of your suit coat creates a distraction in an otherwise sleek, natural look.</li>
<li>The vertical suspender straps make your shoulders appear broader.</li>
<li>Traditional button-on suspenders use a twin-button leather attachment instead of the distracting eyesores that are metal clips.</li>
<li>The Leather enhances any style, you can dress it up or down; leather goes with everything and is ideal for any occasion.</li>
</ul>
<p>But the real reason, the only reason that matters, is that traditional button-on suspenders signal irreverence.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1614203453/n6w6roxwwogsl7dp5tug.png"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>Convenient Style - No Tailor Required</h3>
<p>Having just sang the praises of the look of traditional button-on suspenders/braces, there’s one glaring problem, and it has more to do with our modern lifestyle than anything.</p>
<p>Men tend to value convenience over style, but the two don’t have to be mutually exclusive.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1614203681/x4vpynfzeykmywmj2qln.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p>You want the look of traditional button-on suspenders, but the thought of having to choose which pants are going to be your “suspender pants,” and then taking them to a tailor only to lose a button later makes this option not worth most men’s time or effort.</p>
<p>The market is awash with patents attempting to solve this problem, but in every case the cure is worse than the disease.</p>
<p>The last project I funded through Kickstarter was exactly what I needed to bridge the gap.  I had patented a magnetic clasp with the ideal magnet and enclosure to provide maximum pull force without compromising on the strength of material.  I just didn’t realize the best use for my creation was in fashion not fitness.</p>

Bespoke Style Braces - No Tailor Required
 
Traditional suspenders, “braces” for the sartorially inclined, are like the Scotch of Style.
The way the leather transitions the linen straps to your waistband is timeless, but unless you have your own tailor you most likely think they’re reserved for A-list actors or high finance.
The suspenders you wore to your best friend’s wedding felt more like a novelty; cheap elastic and tacky metal clips shimmer while yanking up, awkwardly, on your waistband.  You certainly didn’t feel like Marlon Brando in “A Streetcar Named Desire.”
Stratton Suspender Company has bridged this gap between the timeless look of traditional button-on braces without the hassle of tailoring.
 

Men's fashion accessories serve a purpose, they project confidence, competence, and personality; they are functional, functional to the narrative you tell about who you are before you even say a word.
 
Stratton Suspender Co. uses a Patent Pending “Modular Twin-Magnetic Clasp System” to give the user the look of traditional button-on suspenders with the convenience of clips; yet with a comfort and versatility unmatched in history.
 

The magnets are more than strong enough, we could have gotten away with half the magnet clasps but it would not have that classic look.
Guaranteed to not come off or your money back.

 
More than that, the modularity of Stratton Suspenders allows you to interchange different straps adding an entirely new dimension to men’s style.
One set of Stratton Suspenders guarantees you’ll have the perfect look for any occasion.
 

Nothing too showy, mind you (the goal isn't to look like a peacock), but just noticeable enough so that a trained eye can recognize - and admire - the finer points of what makes your style special.
 
Stratton Suspenders - The Subtlety is Magnetic
Traditional button-on suspenders appeal to a certain kind of man, the capable, confident, and in control.
 

The perfect intersection of form and function - Stratton Suspenders
 
This powerhouse accessory defines many of Hollywood’s most iconic roles.  So what is it about these classic suspenders that leave such an impression?

Suspenders reinforce good posture, reminding the user to pull his shoulders back and down, opening the chest up for a more commanding and confident presence.
Suspenders streamline your torso making you appear taller, unlike a belt, which chops your torso in half.
Suits were never made for belts. The buckle at the opening of your suit coat creates a distraction in an otherwise sleek, natural look.
The vertical suspender straps make your shoulders appear broader.
Traditional button-on suspenders use a twin-button leather attachment instead of the distracting eyesores that are metal clips.
The Leather enhances any style, you can dress it up or down; leather goes with everything and is ideal for any occasion.

But the real reason, the only reason that matters, is that traditional button-on suspenders signal irreverence.
 

We are grown-ups now - Now we can dress like it, even in a t-shirt
 
You don’t seek permission; you set the tone.  You don’t crave acceptance with brand names plastered across your chest.  You’re you; you wear plain t-shirts, jeans, and well-tailored suits.
People are drawn to the way you make the ordinary look extraordinary.
 

An Austin Original
 
Convenient Style - No Tailor Required
Having just sang the praises of the look of traditional button-on suspenders/braces, there’s one glaring problem, and it has more to do with our modern lifestyle than anything.
Men tend to value convenience over style, but the two don’t have to be mutually exclusive.
 

Stratton Suspenders hopes to give men a reason to get creative with their style again - Get the look you love with the convenience you need without a tailor.​
 
You want the look of traditional button-on suspenders, but the thought of having to choose which pants are going to be your “suspender pants,” and then taking them to a tailor only to lose a button later makes this option not worth most men’s time or effort.
The market is awash with patents attempting to solve this problem, but in every case the cure is worse than the disease.
The last project I funded through Kickstarter was exactly what I needed to bridge the gap.  I had patented a magnetic clasp with the ideal magnet and enclosure to provide maximum pull force without compromising on the strength of material.  I just didn’t realize the best use for my creation was in fashion not fitness.
 

Product Testing Day - The Magnets are PLENTY Strong Enough
 
They Told Us It Wouldn't Work - So We Had To Do It Ourselves
“We’ve taken a look at your drawings and your description and our designers said that it won’t work.” - Largest Fashion and Design Product Development and Production Company in Texas
This was the reply I received after submitting my design and product description to a fashion product developer specializing in prototypes for fashion start-ups.
 

""Quit Lyin'?! It totally works!""
 
Years of research into magnets and textiles had uniquely positioned me to see an opportunity in the men’s accessory industry that no one in fashion could.
The twin-magnetic clasp of Stratton Suspenders is the product of a lot of trial and error in finding the perfect magnet, covering, and casing to ensure proper strength.
 

Exact Design Delivered to the ""Experts...""
 
Stratton Suspenders are so strong that they are comparable to the strongest clip-on suspenders, but with the soft mesh inside they will not rip the waistband of your dress pants like the sharp teeth of clips.
 

Custom Leather - Handpicked, Handmade, and Hand Stitched in Austin, Texas
 
Modularity - Any Style, Any Setting
After the “suits” at the big textile manufacturers told us it couldn’t be done, and then we did it, and having them turn out incredible, we decided to go all in.
Each pair of Stratton Suspenders is handmade at our Austin studio in the heart of Texas.  This affords us a great deal of flexibility in patterns and styles, the kind of customization we could never afford with a manufacturer.
But how do we translate that into something truly value-added to our customers?
 

Stratton Suspenders' unique modular design allows the user to remove the straps and interchange a color or pattern more befitting to your specific circumstance.
 
Well, the Stratton Suspenders “Modular Twin-Magnetic Clasp” is exactly that, modular.  The drop down leather “tongue” with stud is removable from the suspender strap itself, and the “ears” (the twin-magnetic clasp) are removable from the drop-down tongue.
 

We will be taking custom ""Wedding Runs"" to make sure your Wedding is seamless
 
This allows our customer the unique ability to purchase multiple “Stratton Suspender” straps without having to purchase an additional set of magnetic clasps.
 

Continually releasing new small batch, limited run colors and patterns to build your collection for any occasion.
 
We will constantly be updating our strap patterns and fabrics so our customers can continue to mix and match the straps and leather for the perfect look for any occasion.

Stratton Suspenders were designed with versatility in mind, and that is our commitment.  The leather and linen straps of Stratton Suspenders will never be “out of style.”

<h3>Hand-Sewn Saddle Stitching vs Machine Lock Stitching</h3>
<p>Hand-sewn saddle stitching uses the “running stitch” technique that offers a stronger construction for our products. Technically, hand-stitched line uses a single thread with needle on both end. Two independent thread intertwine with each other that will not unravel. As a result, the leather will not be separated even if one side of the thread happens to break.</p>
<p>In contrast, other products made by sewing machine with the “lock stitch” technique is more vulnerable since the entire thread will potentially unravel if the thread happens to break, as a result, separate the leather pieces.</p>

We reached and exceeded the funding goal, with the help of amazing supporters through personal network, and Indiegogo Representatives. After project success there's been an overwhelming demand of these watches, and those who knew of the running campaign missed out on the opportunity to support and wanted one. There's a demand, and now it's back on Indiegogo!The demand came after the first campaign, the production, product design and the delivery process, the success of the first project sparked interests in those who missed out. This universe works in strange ways, one doesn't have it and others want it! This now brings us this Encore Campaign, to give others the opportunity to support and receive their watch reward below retail value.Those who supported the campaign received their watch rewards, which meant Arrow Project potential supporters missed out on the watch rewards, technically being, sold out! It feels awesome on your skin as the watch is made from the highest grade sandalwood, which is not affected by the weather, such as heat or cold.Another great feature of sandalwood is it has a luxurious lasting natural aroma. And the wood gives you long life durability unlike leather bands.It's extremely light weight, in that it's not heavy on the wrist. It's natural, unique, simple and one of a kind. It's fashionable and looks great on!Note: This is a fashion watch; being a feature to your style. It's not a sport, swimming, exercising watch, etc. Not meant to be used during times of heavy duty activity, it can effect the wood flexibility, i.e., picking up furniture, or wrestling. Design. Package design. (This took weeks to finalize the box design.

If all you do is play mini-games and while doing so you also keep wifi/bluetooth on, then don't expect to get through the day. If all you do is use basic apps but then plug in and use the MicroSD (which automatically charges Gameband while in use) then you'll get a few days of use.  What we can say is that the 400mAh battery we've included is the upper end of what you normally see in Smartwatches, and together with Qualcomm and our ODM we will continually look for ways to extend battery life.</p><p><b>Water resistance:</b> For those worried about getting your Gameband wet, have no fear, Gameband will be be IPX7 compliant.

This is so we had more room, and more money, for the things we did put in.  We are looking at partners who can help us build optional straps that do these things, for customers who really want this functionality.</p><p><b>Trademarks and IP:</b> We've tried to respect everything we need to legally herein, both in terms of technology and marketing materials.

Another benefit of the Snapdragon processor is that it has already been designed for MicroSD support, which will further de-risk our development efforts.Other key hardware areas for us are the inclusion of a square, 1:1 AMOLED 1.63"" display, WiFi 802.11 and Bluetooth 4.2 (way better for audio).For those worried about getting your Gameband wet, have no fear: Gameband will be be IPX7 compliant! Learn more about Qualcomm and Gameband by viewing the full interview with Jim Merrick, Director of Marketing, Qualcomm. The upgradable MicroSD capability turns Gameband into a high-speed portable drive, hosting your PC Games, photos, music, files and more. Our software & unique IC switch mean that when plugged into a computer the MicroSD runs our PixelFurnace game management and launch platform at USB3.0 speeds, and when connected via Bluetooth data can be accessed via mobile or audio devices.Plug and Play from your MicroSD using PixelFurnance PixelFurnance is basically like an iTunes for Games, that you can take with you and plug in anywhere. PixelFurnace, Gameband's proprietary management and launch platform We're running Android Nougat 7.0Gameband is compatible with iOS and Android, and will have access to iOS and Android Phone based Companion Apps to help manage your Gameband. Apps shipping with Gameband include: Technically there are four key areas that make Gameband work:
Hardware (processor and connectivity)
Software: (Android Operating System & companion Apps)
MicroSD solution (accessible by PC)
PixelFurnace (game launch software)
Our team has already shipped a product, to over 20 countries and 35 retailers, that required experience in all of the above areas.With Qualcomm support we have been introduced and are working with a leading ODM with over a decade of experience in Android development and deployment, with multiple products already in market. Together we are making sure every feature we want to integrate in Gameband will be delivered as promised.The core functionalities we have been testing and prototyping are as follows:
Basic Android Operation
General productivity app use
Companion App capability
Bluetooth Audio
Voice control (Alexa)
Mini-game operation
PixelFurnace launch via MicroSD
Backup and other backend services
 Gameband was designed in San Francisco by MATTER; a design studio with a portfolio that includes Samsung, Google, Sonos, and Logitech. Their Chief designer, Max Burton, has been involved in almost 100 wearable projects, from Smartwatches to luxury watches. We had specific requirements for our design. It needed to be robust, as durable as a watch, while incorporating gaming influences and giving us the flexibility to create special editions, without overly complicating the manufacturing process. Drawing inspiration from rugged weaponry, vehicles and tools seen in games, the goal was to bring about a real-world device that you could just as easily imagine inside a game.The result was a two-piece frame, held in place with 4 bolt screws, delivering both a design objective, and a functionality objective all in one.Learn more about our design process by viewing full interviews with the team here: Interview with Max Burton, Founder and Chief Designer, MATTER Interview with Toby Stopper, Industrial Designer, MATTER  Special editions and mini-games: we've partnered for launch with two iconic brands to bring top name brands to your wrist. Atari, who brought gaming into the living room, are working with us to bring it to your wrist. Rewriting classic titles like Pong, Centipede and more for our 1:1 1.63"" display, with flush glass format for easy swiping, Gameband Atari Edition comes in Atari Red, with a variety of straps that let you show your love for this timeless gaming legend. Terraria, one of the most amazing indie game titles on the planet, is another launch partner we are fortunate to have onboard. Incorporating some of the well known images and design elements of the game, we are also working with Terraria on an exclusive mini-game version that will incorporate both the technology and the context of Gameband: i.e. a product you will take into the real-world and your daily life. It's about movement, gestures, voice, steps, location and lots more.  We believe that by building the right product, with the right technology and OS, partnered with great gaming studios.....you are going to see some amazing gaming experiences come to Gameband, and we can't wait to share them with you. Play Atari Retro games like Asteroids directly on your wrist.    There are four Gameband Editions available: Gameband Edition itself, Atari and Terraria Editions and Droid Edition. The differences between the various editions are colors, straps, packaging, and watchfaces. Here's the overview! Gameband Droid Edition The Gameband Droid Edition is a high-end Gameband offering that includes: Brushed aluminium finish, black leather strap and Gorilla Glass. Gameband Droid Edition 1.

Fill out this Google Doc form with your info and we'll include this FREE gift with your Gameband order (limit 1 gift per person) Thanks!Backer feedback on GamebandDisclaimers and other stuff you should knowShipping: We've done our best to be accurate on shipping fees, however please be aware that you may be on the hook personally for customers fees and import taxes.International orders: We will be shipping to most countries in the world barring the following countries due to logistical issues: Argentina, Belarus, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Myanmar/Burma, North Korea, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.Straps: There is almost no substance in nature or created by man that will not cause an allergic reaction to somebody, somewhere. Our straps are all made from basic and common materials (silicon, leather, canvas nylon) however it is up to you to ensure Gameband is safe to wear. If you have sensitive skin than contact your doctor before wearing!Battery life: People use devices like Gameband in so many different ways that it is almost impossible to say that the battery will last 'x' days. If all you do is play mini-games and while doing so you also keep wifi/bluetooth on, then don't expect to get through the day. If all you do is use basic apps but then plug in and use the MicroSD (which automatically charges Gameband while in use) then you'll get a few days of use.  What we can say is that the 400mAh battery we've included is the upper end of what you normally see in Smartwatches, and together with Qualcomm and our ODM we will continually look for ways to extend battery life.Water resistance: For those worried about getting your Gameband wet, have no fear, Gameband will be be IPX7 compliant. This means it is suitable for: Splashes Rain or Snow Showering Incidental exposure to water of up to 1 meter for up to 30 minutesHRM and GPS: In case you missed it in the specs: we do not have a heart rate monitor or GPS built in. This is so we had more room, and more money, for the things we did put in.  We are looking at partners who can help us build optional straps that do these things, for customers who really want this functionality.Trademarks and IP: We've tried to respect everything we need to legally herein, both in terms of technology and marketing materials. If we missed anything it was not deliberate, please drop us a line and let us know. For clarity: this Gameband is not affiliated to Mojang SA in anyway (the makers of Minecraft), although our team has worked with them on a wearable band in the past. If you have a Minecraft license then it should work on the new and improved PixelFurnace that will ship with this Gameband. We'll test and post an update on that in the future.Production: We are working with one of the worlds leading wearable manufacturers, with years of experience, and a design process that focused from day one on an objective of creating a product that can be produced on time and to scale.",31.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>What is 42aFurnace?</h3>
<p>    4  2  a  Furnace is an engine that generates funds for Christian missions (30% of profits go to the Christian missions) while at the same time spreading Gods word and glorifying him through clothing. The name is in reference to Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego and the Angel in Daniel 3.</p>
<p>    The Christian missions we support are <strong><em>Night Shift street ministries</em></strong> and <strong><em>Love Global</em></strong>. Hopefully when we are more developed we will be able to cycle in other charities as well.</p>
<p>    Your contribution either directly, or through sharing this with your friends and praying for us is such a blessing. And gets us one step closer to being able to save souls and point peoples’ lives towards Jesus through the clothing we wear.</p>

</div></div>","What is 42aFurnace?
    4  2  a  Furnace is an engine that generates funds for Christian missions (30% of profits go to the Christian missions) while at the same time spreading Gods word and glorifying him through clothing. The name is in reference to Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego and the Angel in Daniel 3.
    The Christian missions we support are Night Shift street ministries and Love Global. Hopefully when we are more developed we will be able to cycle in other charities as well.
    Your contribution either directly, or through sharing this with your friends and praying for us is such a blessing. And gets us one step closer to being able to save souls and point peoples’ lives towards Jesus through the clothing we wear.

What We Need & How you can help
 
    We need a minimum of $18000 dollars and are hoping for $24000 so we can make an order in bulk and get the printing prices to a manageable level to sell in retail stores.
    This is my purpose from God, it has taken a huge amount of time and effort over the past 2 years, but I truly believe that all of us together can make this happen.
    Why not a flexible campaign? We're dedicated to glorifying God and giving our best as an offering to Him. For all-over t-shirt printing this means screen printing, and you can't get shirts printed by this method in ones and twos. it only starts to be possible to get these shirts into retail stores at 900 or 1200 shirts per a design. so if on Indiegogo we only sold 100 shirts we wouldn’t be able to fulfill the order. That’s why we have a fixed campaign.
    What happens if you go over the $18000? We'll be able to start printing! This is the absolute minimum, we are hoping for $24000, and if we get an overwhelming outpour of support we'd love to offer some more of the designs we've got cooking and can't wait to get out there.
 
Questions
 
    When will I receive my shirt? In Canada and the continental U.S.A. they will arrive before Christmas (maybe not Alaska) everywhere else we will try our best to get them to you asap but the international shipping may not get to you in time. Hopefully it will, but we can't guarantee it, :) perhaps stuff a stocking with a coupon saying ""1 cool shirt coming"".
    What of and where from is my shirt made? These are high quality 100% cotton shirts. the cotton is grown and woven in the U.S.A., sewn together in Haiti under good working conditions approved by the International Labour Organization, the Better Work Program and the International Finance Corporation. The T-shirts are then high quality all-over printed in the U.S.A. 
    How do I select my size? Take one of your T-shirts that fit you well and measure from armpit to armpit and that is your 'chest size'. The shirts are 'slim fit' T-shirts. *Note sizes XL and above have more room around the stomach.

Traditional square-block protective mask is entirely replaced with aesthetic and seamless design of water-drop shape; thus, you can wear the mask with pride. Designed by a group of minimalist, INOCHI works as a compact facegear for activities, indoors and outdoors alike:(i) Lightweight and elastic;(ii) A built-in space for mini-sanitizer, refillable by users;(iii) Replaceable protective filtration;(iv) Super soft contours and adjustable loops for daylong comfort.    We aim to make INOCHI adaptable to multiple contexts and settings. In international places: airports, hotels, shopping centres, scenic and tourist spotsIn mass transportation: buses, cars, taxis, trams, ferries and boats, subwaysIn social places: restaurants, coffee shops, appointments and gatheringsIn daily activities: in supermarkets and  groceries, in retail storesIn working: on the streets, at schools, in the offices, meetings and business eventsIn activities: outdoor sports, team sports,  gym and physical training classesIn moments of companionship: datings, meetings, gatheringsINOCHI is built to last. Existing face masks - whether by disposable or cloth material, are intended for short duration if not single use. On the contrary, INOCHI - being reusable, easy to clean with replaceable filter, originally aims at long-term use. There is no point protecting ourselves today while harming the environment in future. Let us spend smarter! Below comparison tabulates the budget estimation for conventional protective mask versus INOCHI. The assumption made is 02 items per day for surgical masks and 6 items per month for washable ones, inclusive of 10 washes.By partnering with Abody.ai, a tech expert in providing solutions for body metrics data via artificial intelligence, we achieve better accuracy and convenience in face measurement to produce fit-to-face masks. Abody.ai app is ready on Apple Store for downloading. Face metrics shall be obtained via ONE self-portrait of your face via this app. Alternatively, conventional method with measurement tape remains intact.  Testing",45.0,1,"1 Campaign

LET'S DO THIS! A lifelong PASSION for film inspires us to create yet another film… our 4th! Our director Jivan Avetis yan who grew up in Artsakh has always been captivated by the world of cinema. Jivan’s fascination with film began when he was a little boy growing up in Khachmach, a village on the outskirts of Stepanakert. In fact, Jivan’s lifelong DREAM of creating a film in Khachmach was realized in 2015 with the production of our second feature film The Last Inhabitant, now streaming on Prime.Jivan’s deep-rooted passion for filmmaking is what brings us here to our crowdfunding campaign TODAY! There is so much to be told! We need to REWRITE stories and share it with a mainstream audience.

He will be integrating his findings in our film project.Jivan is no stranger to the international cinematic world as his three previous feature films, Tevanik (also streaming on Amazon Prime), The Last Inhabitant, and Gate to Heaven have their own individual global success stories. Jivan also rocked the Berlinale Talents 2020, a talent program within the framework of the Berlin International Film Festival.

Whether it was a distraction from problems at home, or an escape into a world greater than myself, he was there with me every step of the way – not as a flawless idol, but as someone I could directly relate to. Peter Parker is endearing because he isn't perfect – he gives up, he falls short, he collapses under pressure. Rather than an icon, he's there to reassure the world that they are not alone in their struggles...he is reacting, failing, and prevailing just like anyone else. With this film, we want to dive into his natural human flaws: What defines a man who is crushed by his own mind?

Whether it was a distraction from problems at home, or an escape into a world greater than myself, he was there with me every step of the way – not as a flawless idol, but as someone I could directly relate to. Peter Parker is endearing because he isn't perfect – he gives up, he falls short, he collapses under pressure. Rather than an icon, he's there to reassure the world that they are not alone in their struggles...he is reacting, failing, and prevailing just like anyone else. With this film, we want to dive into his natural human flaws: What defines a man who is crushed by his own mind? We pulled from hundreds of different comic books from over the years, whether it was written by Stan Lee, or Gerry Conway, or Tom DeFalco, or any other legendary writer to take on the character, all in an effort to craft a story that honors the character in the best way that we can.We decided to primarily take inspiration from 'Spider-Man: Blue' (along with many other stories during that era such as 'Death & Destiny' or Gerry Conway's run) and 'The Kid Who Collects Spider-Man', two grounded stories that focus on the melancholic life of the character.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>There's nobody more passionate about making a great zombie movie in all of Essex, maybe all of the UK, than us at Zombie House Productions - but unfortunately one cannot make a film on passion and good will alone, we also need the right equipment and locations, our cast and crew need food and housing, heck even our zombies need makeup (those vain bastards). To that end, we are working with a non-profit organization local to Southend on Sea, Essex, and also a collective community to get as much support as possible. But that still leaves us a bit short on the monetary side, so we're raising funds to cover costs of food, drinks, props, materials, writers, cast, crew and so much more. Every little helps, from £1 up, so please donate what you can and let‘s make this film project happen.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1622376434/oluky7w4honej170ai4d.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Time and again, we as a team have proven that we can make (and release) a feature film, so we are more than qualified to see through the production of a movie from beginning to end - so we would love to say this is risk-free, as we're determined to the teeth to make this movie ... but if 2020 and that virus that's named after a brand of beer (but for the life of it I can't remember which) have taught us anything, it's to expect the unexpected. But unless bad comes to worse and then some, we WILL see this movie through, as making zombie movies is in our blood!!!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Yes we do understand that money can occasionally be a bit on the tight side - heck, we're filmmakers, other than making movies the occasional lack of funds is also in our blood. So if you really want to help but are strapped for cash, why not share our campaign on all social media you can think of - and then some more you have only just googled and are surprised they exist. And tell your friends and family, and heck, even strangers about it incessantly. Paint a mural with the campaign link onto your housefront, spray the link onto planes, trains and automobiles, print out flyers to hand out to passers-by - in short, there are millions of ways to help if you're as passionate about raising the dead as we are - and a big thank you for that in advance!!!</p>

To that end, we are working with a non-profit organization local to Southend on Sea, Essex, and also a collective community to get as much support as possible. But that still leaves us a bit short on the monetary side, so we're raising funds to cover costs of food, drinks, props, materials, writers, cast, crew and so much more. Every little helps, from £1 up, so please donate what you can and let‘s make this film project happen.

 

Risks & Challenges
Time and again, we as a team have proven that we can make (and release) a feature film, so we are more than qualified to see through the production of a movie from beginning to end - so we would love to say this is risk-free, as we're determined to the teeth to make this movie ... but if 2020 and that virus that's named after a brand of beer (but for the life of it I can't remember which) have taught us anything, it's to expect the unexpected. But unless bad comes to worse and then some, we WILL see this movie through, as making zombie movies is in our blood!!!
 

Other Ways You Can Help
Yes we do understand that money can occasionally be a bit on the tight side - heck, we're filmmakers, other than making movies the occasional lack of funds is also in our blood. So if you really want to help but are strapped for cash, why not share our campaign on all social media you can think of - and then some more you have only just googled and are surprised they exist. And tell your friends and family, and heck, even strangers about it incessantly. Paint a mural with the campaign link onto your housefront, spray the link onto planes, trains and automobiles, print out flyers to hand out to passers-by - in short, there are millions of ways to help if you're as passionate about raising the dead as we are - and a big thank you for that in advance!!!",8.0,0,"9 Campaigns

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">ZOMBINATRIX - She's Into Whips and BRAINS!</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1542995727/mingsevbamhmksdtgfiu.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>ABOUT THE MOVIE</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Synopsis:</strong> After Mistress Tawny (Bianca Allaine), a beautiful dominatrix, is brutally murdered by an unsavory gang of thugs, she mysteriously rises from the grave to seek vengeance on her killers. As the supernatural <strong>ZOMBINATRIX</strong>, she takes great pleasure in incorporating her sadistic kinks into killing her enemies- and any poor soul who stands in her way. <strong>After all, she is into whips and BRAINS!</strong></p>
<p><strong>ZOMBINATRIX</strong><strong> </strong>is the hotly anticipated, heavy metal, zombie horror movie starring actress and scream queen, Bianca Allaine, and directed by award-winning filmmaker, Michael Kyne.</p>
<p><strong>ZOMBINATRIX </strong>is a very stylized, sleek, and sexy horror film, which follows the story of a tantalizing zombie dominatrix. As filmmakers, our love of the horror movies and heavy metal music of the late ‘80s and early ‘90s leaves an indelible mark on the aesthetics of our film, with elaborate costuming, striking locations, extravagant sets, and impeccable lighting.</p>
<p>However, this IS a <strong>zombie horror film</strong>, so expect to see ample amounts of blood, monsters,  classic <strong>practical special effects</strong>, and <strong>Hollywood visual effects </strong>including <strong>stop-motion animation</strong> courtesy of award-winning established artists<strong> Webster Colcord</strong> and <strong>Ralph Cordero</strong>.

The suffering I continue to endure after the loss of both Dixie and Molly have affected me in ways I had never expected.

We now know firsthand that life can change drastically in the blink of an eye.On March 11, 2016, Michael's father passed away from a very aggressive cancer, merely 3 days after his 58th birthday, and only months after he was diagnosed. We were by his side during his fight (and, boy, was he a fighter!), doing everything we could to bring what comfort we could. He was far too ill, though, and the outcome was inevitable. Along with family, we held his hand in hospice as he passed away.We attempted to move forward after the heartbreaking loss, but filming again came to a standstill after our beloved Shih Tzu, Molly, became increasingly ill in December 2016 and was diagnosed with Pulmonary Hypertension. Michael and I considered our dogs, Molly and Dixie, the love of our lives. We did everything in our power to save our beautiful, sweet little angel, but her disease had progressed to the point she could no longer breathe outside of an oxygen chamber. On October 27, 2017, we made the agonizing decision to finally end her suffering after having her in my life for nearly 15 years. It was the worst day of our lives.Just as I thought things couldn't get worse, life grew even darker. Only 7 months after Molly's passing, on May 30, 2018, we lost our beautiful Shih Tzu Dixie only days after her 17th birthday to cancer.Needless to say, after these losses, our lives were left completely shattered. The suffering I continue to endure after the loss of both Dixie and Molly have affected me in ways I had never expected. I will be forever grateful for having them as shining beacons in my life, but I will never be the same person again. I fell into an even deeper depression and began having debilitating panic attacks like I've never experienced before.Honestly, I was hesitant to even bother with our movie, but Michael lovingly encouraged me to continue. Some days are much more difficult than others, but we remain determined to finish our dream project, ZOMBINATRIX.Since this is an independent movie, there may be more challenges along the way. However, Michael and I are completely committed to bringing you the BEST movie possible. We know you work very hard for your money and therefore we take our work very seriously. We believe that through hard work, creative solutions to challenges, and the love and support of you all, we will finish this movie through sheer determination and will-power. Of course, it will be much easier and quicker to finish if we have you all on board!I want to thank you so much for reading this very personal portion of our story and for believing in and supporting our dream.Much love and light,Bianca Allaine",13.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><i><strong>Keep It A Secret </strong></i>recounts the inspiring <i><strong>true</strong></i> story of the dawn of Irish surfing and how the sport’s brave trailblazing pioneers found peace and escape in the water during the most violent years of The Troubles conflict between The Republic of Ireland and Britain in the late 1960s and 1970s.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you everyone for the generous support for the Keep It A Secret crowdfunding campaign! </strong></p>
<p>The financial support from the campaign will help final editing, music licensing costs and give us budget to shoot additional water and drone footage with renowned Irish surf and water cinematographer<strong><i> <a href=""http://www.kevlsmith.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Kev L. Smith</a></i></strong>. Kev's amazing footage will bring to life the majestic coast of Ireland, where world-class waves were first surfed by the pioneers of Irish surfing in the 1960s when the island was a surfing paradise completely unknown to the outside world. </p>
<p> </p>
<div> </div>
<h3><strong>About the director:</strong></h3>
<p>My name is Sean Duggan, I've spent much of my career working in radio/music and advertising. I've been thinking about making a film for years and five years ago I started to actively pursue and learn everything I could about filmmaking: watching more movies, reading every book I could get my hands on that relates to film, and making short films in Brooklyn.</p>

<h3><strong>About the film:</strong></h3>
<p>Three years ago I started to compile a list of film projects and stories which I thought would make interesting and entertaining movies. One story, I began to develop as a script was about a (fictional) California surfer who arrives in Ireland in the 1960s to bring the sport to island at the time when surfing was completely unknown and the West Coast Ireland was a remote place not yet touched by the modern world.</p>
<p>As I started doing some preliminary research for my script and began interviewing the Irish pioneers of surfing, many whom had never shared their stories before on film. I started to realize that the <i><strong>true</strong></i> story of how this group of trailblazing pioneers came together as the island was entering the most violent years of <i><strong>The Troubles</strong></i> conflict was an amazing story and better than <u><strong><i>any</i></strong></u> scripted film I could develop. And thus began the journey into making the documentary, <strong>Keep It A Secret</strong>. </p>
<p>This film covers.</p>
<ul>
<li>The story of a Dublin boy,  Kevin Cavey who would see a surfing photo in Reader's Digest at the age of 12 and make it his life's mission to bring surfing to Ireland.</li>
<li>The Troubles Conflict between Britain and The Republic of Ireland, how surfers on both sides of the conflict (Northern Ireland and The Republic of Ireland) came to find peace in the water</li>
<li>The Belfast Boys who would take a DIY approach to surfing and develop the sport on their own terms with fearlessness and creativity that was year's ahead of mainstream commercial surfing in California.</li>
<li>The Black Wetsuit Brigade a group of Irish surfers who would protest all major international surf contests and fight the commercialization of surfing in Ireland.</li>
<li>The 1972 European Surfing Championship in Lahinch, Ireland. When Ireland hosted their first major international surfing contest during the most violent year of The Troubles conflict.</li>

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">A Not So Typical Love Story:</span></h3>
<h3><i><font><span style=""font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;"">""Desperate times, Desperate measures""</span></font></i></h3>
<p>A line from the script that defines the whole story of <i>""Goin' Up""</i>. The film is about a young man who joins a team of criminals to steal money so he can reunite with the love of his life on a wealthy colonized station on the moon.</p>
<p>The concept for the story stayed in my head rent free since late 2019. I knew I wanted to do a story set in the near future, involving the moon and a love story in the middle of all of it, but I didn't know exactly. Then the year 2020 happened and I was able to fully form the script we have now.</p>
<p>On the Surface, the film is high octane Sci-Fi Crime Thriller set in an alternative near future (Within the next 10 years or so) where the Earth is in a state of collapse, but it really serves as a backdrop a few things: the lengths you can go for someone you love, how people can use societal movements or situations for their own gain and the metaphor of using space colonization to escape our problems rather than facing capitalism head on.</p>
<p>I pull influences from the films I love and inspire me to be the filmmaker I am.  Taking influence from <i>“Good Time”, “Elysium”, “If Beale Street Could Talk”</i> and <i>“Clockers”</i>. </p>
<p>The film is designed to be a thriller packed with colorful characters, dynamic/odd camera techniques and a unique use of combining genres that do not typically go together. The story is a nonlinear one, taking place within a few hours and you see fragments of his past with his Girlfriend. As the story takes place from the main character's perspective, you feel his sense of anxiety and suspicion.</p>
<h3><strong>The Budget:</strong></h3>
<p>Our budget goal is <strong>$35,000</strong>. Here is where that budget will go:</p>
<p>-$9,000 for Crew</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Films have always had a big impact on me as you can not only find entertainment in them, but they can open up your eyes to aspects of life you weren't aware of or remind you not to make the same mistakes of the past. Over this last year, I feel like my approach to filmmaking has changed significantly. Portraying realistic depictions of the region I was born and raised in felt important to me as there is so much culture under our beautiful California sun. Seeing films such as <i>""The Last Black Man in San Francisco""</i>, <i>""Blindspotting""</i> and <i>""Fruitvale Station"" </i>showed just how much we have to offer. </p>
<p>We have many talented artists from all walks of life coming together to work on this film, all with the potential to go far in our careers. With your support,  we could bring a vision to life that we're all so passionate about. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There will always be risks and challenges to making a film of any size. The usual risks of weather, loss of cast, crew and location that could cause delays. Of course now we have the new challenge of Covid and potential lockdown scenarios. As a crew, we are ambitious and crazy enough to take on every challenge that comes our way.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you were to support us in other ways, please spread the word about the project! </p>
<p>Share our IndieGoGo page, email your friends and family, post about us on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. You never know who might be looking.</p>
<p>We truly appreciate any support to achieve our goal.</p>

The film is designed to be a thriller packed with colorful characters, dynamic/odd camera techniques and a unique use of combining genres that do not typically go together. The story is a nonlinear one, taking place within a few hours and you see fragments of his past with his Girlfriend. As the story takes place from the main character's perspective, you feel his sense of anxiety and suspicion.

THE CAST:

Tyson Brown as Marcus Jordan: 
A 22 year old who comes from a hard upbringing but still means well in a world that challenges his morals and insecurities. As society on Earth begins to collapse, Marcus finds out that his wealthy girlfriend,  Abigail, and her family have been selected to go up to the colonized moon, elevating his fear of losing her and leading to an argument that puts their relationship on “break”. Marcus, desperate to recapture the love he let go because of his selfishness, takes an offer from a friend to rob a bank in order to gain the money needed to get smuggled to the moon.

 Abby Tozer as Abigail ""Abby"" Francis
A 21 year who comes from an upper class family. With her parents coming in and out of the house because of work, Abby developed a sense of independence and responsibility to take care of her two younger sisters. She meets Marcus through a chance encounter and falls in love with him despite his non wealthy background. When she discovers that her family has been chosen to be transported to the moon, she tells Marcus and sees he is upset at the idea of her leaving. After an argument, Abby decides she must do what’s best for her family, promising Marcus that even though they are on “break”, she still loves him.

Ian S. Peterson as Jackson
The handsome leader of the heist whose intentions are not as clear as they seem. 

Romeo Abasolo as Caesar Navarro
Marcus’s close friend who also comes from a low income household. After a successful series of robberies, Caesar invites  Marcus into a new heist that would allow him to gain enough money to get to the colonized moon.

Natalia Dominguez as Franceska ""Frankie"" Robins
A young woman who is in a relationship with her girlfriend, Millie. After some bad decisions, Millie gets arrested and Frankie joins the heist to get the money needed to get her out of jail and move far away.

Ray Raymundo as Zack Reyes
A naive former football player who’s looking to gain some money for an injury to his knee that put his career on indefinite hold.

Art Brown as Norman Fisher
A wealthy man who owns the building the group robs.
The Impact
Films have always had a big impact on me as you can not only find entertainment in them, but they can open up your eyes to aspects of life you weren't aware of or remind you not to make the same mistakes of the past. Over this last year, I feel like my approach to filmmaking has changed significantly. Portraying realistic depictions of the region I was born and raised in felt important to me as there is so much culture under our beautiful California sun. Seeing films such as ""The Last Black Man in San Francisco"", ""Blindspotting"" and ""Fruitvale Station"" showed just how much we have to offer. 
We have many talented artists from all walks of life coming together to work on this film, all with the potential to go far in our careers. With your support,  we could bring a vision to life that we're all so passionate about. 

Risks & Challenges
There will always be risks and challenges to making a film of any size. The usual risks of weather, loss of cast, crew and location that could cause delays. Of course now we have the new challenge of Covid and potential lockdown scenarios. As a crew, we are ambitious and crazy enough to take on every challenge that comes our way.

<p>Friends and family,</p>
<p>Appreciate you for opening the link! As some of you may know, I gave up my D1 football graduate scholarship at the University of Central to pursue a passion for film.  I also got into a top 5 film school at The University of Southern California.

<p>I'm super excited about this upcoming experience, but I'm even MORE EXCITED about the project I'm directing in October. I wrote a script that I'm very passionate about, I'm collaborating with an awesome/very skilled crew from up and down the east coast, and I'm also working with some really compelling actors. </p>
<p>With your help, I can give my craft some identity before I head off to school. Your donation will go to securing locations and equipment, Covid 19 protocols, craft services/meals, and housing arrangements.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Some incentives:</p>
<p>$50 for a major thanks in the film.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The Sunny Side is an observational documentary following the life of Alfred Engerer, a Toronto native and legendary glass-blower who lives in a slow, nostalgia-filled world, and invites the audience to reminisce through his musings. Alfred spends his time surrounding himself with art, music, and other things that inspire him, including sharing his work with young creatives. Despite achieving acclaimed status for his work, in the late 2010s, Alfred was evicted, along with other artists, from his studio of 20 years at 442 Dufferin. His space was demolished to make way for condo development, and Alfred has not found a studio space since, due to the absurdly high costs of living in Toronto. Alfred’s work is kept in storage and around his home, although the majority of his public installations have been destroyed. The studio’s destruction took a toll on his self-esteem and artistic endeavours, but ultimately he decided to embrace the odds and keep humble. While his artistic output is important, the film will act as a character study of a truly unique man by focusing on Alfred’s persona and lifestyle.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are looking to raise funds to help us tell this incredible story.</p>
<p>All contributors will receive:</p>
<p>- Personal thank you</p>
<p>$10+ donations:</p>
<p>-High-quality digital pack of stills from the film - great to print and frame or have as a wallpaper for a device</p>
<p>$20+ donations:</p>
<p>- Ticket to advance remote screening OR a digital copy of the doc</p>
<p>$40+ donations:</p>
<p>-Your name in the film credits</p>
<p>$50+ donations:</p>
<p>-Exclusive behind-the-scenes footage and deleted scenes</p>
<p>$100+ donations:</p>
<p>-Set of high-quality digital art prints including artwork by Alfred Engerer and Sam Kilpatrick </p>
<p>$200+ donations:</p>
<p>-Executive Producer Credit</p>
</div><p>If we raise enough to rent the hot shop studio, top-tier donors may be able to receive a piece of blown glass artwork made during the production of this documentary (TBC)</p><div><p>Primarily, the film will serve as an observation of an old soul and reveal that no matter the circumstances, we must stay true to ourselves and look on the bright side. This story is not an average artist biopic, but rather a tale of how a man who lost everything was able to come through to the other side. Alfred’s story is one that is needed now more than ever. The City of Toronto’s diminishing support for independent artists and working class citizens, not only affected Alfred but thousands of others. Sharing Alfred’s story not only sheds light on an unfortunate situation but offers a positive reflection for the next generation to take away from.</p></div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Renting studio space where we can capture Alfred working on blown glass artwork could prove to be difficult due to pandemic restrictions, given that glassblowing involves shared tools that go in the mouth and close proximity to instructors. While this issue is proving to become less and less concerning with pandemic restrictions opening up, it is still a possibility. On another note, rental fees for glass studios are incredibly expensive, so your help is needed now more than ever. </p> <p>We would also like to capture footage for either b-roll or a walking interview of places where his work is publicly on display, however, depending on the locations there may be permits and insurance which will need to be paid for. Since this is the element which holds the largest temporal value in the film, paying for location permits is something that needs to be accounted for and funded. </p>

Despite achieving acclaimed status for his work, in the late 2010s, Alfred was evicted, along with other artists, from his studio of 20 years at 442 Dufferin. His space was demolished to make way for condo development, and Alfred has not found a studio space since, due to the absurdly high costs of living in Toronto. Alfred’s work is kept in storage and around his home, although the majority of his public installations have been destroyed. The studio’s destruction took a toll on his self-esteem and artistic endeavours, but ultimately he decided to embrace the odds and keep humble. While his artistic output is important, the film will act as a character study of a truly unique man by focusing on Alfred’s persona and lifestyle.

What We Need & What You Get
We are looking to raise funds to help us tell this incredible story.
All contributors will receive:
- Personal thank you
$10+ donations:
-High-quality digital pack of stills from the film - great to print and frame or have as a wallpaper for a device
$20+ donations:
- Ticket to advance remote screening OR a digital copy of the doc
$40+ donations:
-Your name in the film credits
$50+ donations:
-Exclusive behind-the-scenes footage and deleted scenes
$100+ donations:
-Set of high-quality digital art prints including artwork by Alfred Engerer and Sam Kilpatrick 
$200+ donations:
-Executive Producer Credit
If we raise enough to rent the hot shop studio, top-tier donors may be able to receive a piece of blown glass artwork made during the production of this documentary (TBC)Primarily, the film will serve as an observation of an old soul and reveal that no matter the circumstances, we must stay true to ourselves and look on the bright side. This story is not an average artist biopic, but rather a tale of how a man who lost everything was able to come through to the other side. Alfred’s story is one that is needed now more than ever. The City of Toronto’s diminishing support for independent artists and working class citizens, not only affected Alfred but thousands of others. Sharing Alfred’s story not only sheds light on an unfortunate situation but offers a positive reflection for the next generation to take away from.
Risks & Challenges
Renting studio space where we can capture Alfred working on blown glass artwork could prove to be difficult due to pandemic restrictions, given that glassblowing involves shared tools that go in the mouth and close proximity to instructors. While this issue is proving to become less and less concerning with pandemic restrictions opening up, it is still a possibility. On another note, rental fees for glass studios are incredibly expensive, so your help is needed now more than ever.  We would also like to capture footage for either b-roll or a walking interview of places where his work is publicly on display, however, depending on the locations there may be permits and insurance which will need to be paid for. Since this is the element which holds the largest temporal value in the film, paying for location permits is something that needs to be accounted for and funded.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Welcome to The Sawyer Massacre final pre production Indiegogo campaign.  We have raised more than 20K towards our budget and now we need your help to get that final push to bring the CHAINSAW back to TEXAS! The Sawyer Massacre is a feature length fan film and unofficial prequel to the iconic horror film, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.      Because it's not only iconic but it's scary as hell!The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is the film that inspired director, Steve Merlo to become a filmmaker! It's also the first film to truly give him nightmares. It's just simply the most realistic horror film ever made and there are moments where you actually forget that it's just a film. It's incredibly inspiring how subtle the filmmakers were  able to display such strong messages and themes on the state of the social climate of that time period. In no way could that be duplicated but our script has small reflections of many similar themes happening today, paralleled with the social issues of the mid 60's, which is when our film takes place.It is our intent not to copy what the original did, but use it as influence in a stylistic way. Our film will have more blood and kills but will still be very subtle in it's delivery.  Our goal for the campaign is to raise $12,500 CAD (Approx $10,000 USD) towards our production budget. The money we raise will go into financing this film at the best possible level. The more money we raise, the more professional it will be. No profit will be made off of distribution of this film and none of the money raised will go into any other film projects. All funds received will go directly into this project only! The money raised will go into the pre-production, production and post production stages which include,Distributing all perksLocation feesProp rentalsEquipment rentalsInsuranceCast and CrewPermitsAccommodations for cast and crewCraft servicesEditing & Foley/ADR If we succeed in raising our 12.5K to film in Texas, we have a stretch goals to make our film even better! The more we raise, the better this film can be!Stretch Goal #1 - MORE SFX: If we reach a goal of $25,000 CAD ($20,000 USD Approx)we'll be able to make it much bloodier and have way cooler FX done by our awesome SFX artist, Stephanie Escamilla.Stretch Goal #2 - MORE SHOOTING DAYS: If we reach a goal of $37,000 CAD ($30,000 USD Approx) we'll be able to extend the shooting dates by 5 days giving us more flexibility to capture greater shots and better acting performances.Stretch Goal #3 - HIGH END POST PRODUCTION: If we reach a goal of 49,000 CAD ($40,000 USD Approx) we'll be able to hire a great post production team to help bring this film to life.  Jordan O’Neal is a Houston native actor and graduate from the University of Texas.

I recently played the AFC Richmond coach in Season 1 of the Golden Globe award winning Apple TV series, Ted Lasso, with Jason Sudeikis. My next two roles are both back in the horror genre; Playing Mr. Daniels in Mosaic (from the team behind the festival smash hit I Scream on the Beach) and Jared in Strawmen (from the Mycho team)</p>
<p>We have an amazing team who are essential in bringing the vision to the screen, be it cinematographer Andy Boothby (Black Lizard Tales), Editors Alex Churchyard and Michael Holiday (I Scream on the Beach, The Allotment), Visual Effects John Selling and Matt Westrup (Dr. Sleep and Gorillaz respectively) or musicians including the band Die Gruwel.

<p>We have a big flashback scene planned which I can only describe as Monster Squad Versus Cowboys. This means hiring the Wild West town for a day of filming as well as well as creation of the monsters.

<p><br/>'Ice Cream' is drawn from our lead actress and story producer Ellie Rose Boswell's own anorexia experiences. The film follows Amy, a woman<strong> recovering from anorexia,</strong> who gets caught between the illness and her overbearing mother while attempting to buy an ice cream for her young daughter.</p>
<p>We are aiming this film at <strong>loved ones of anorexia sufferers or anorexia sufferers who have made a step towards recovery</strong>. We want this film to provide a better understanding of how to talk to those suffering, the stumbling blocks both they and their loved ones may encounter along the way and to highlight that recovery isn't a straight forward, bound to succeed avenue.<br/> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1629842365/dfyq8yrmreqd4cmjiiwu.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p><br/>The portrayal of anorexia in the media has <strong>repeatedly been misrepresented</strong>, emphasising the illness’s misconceptions and misunderstanding to people who know little to no information. For example, anorexia is often glamorised through film, lending itself to the<strong> misconception that anorexia starts from a place of vanity - that it's a shallow problem and not seen as a mental health illness.</strong></p>
<p>'ICE CREAM’ aims to address these misconceptions,<strong> promote a more realistic portrayal of someone’s anorexia recovery journey </strong>and<strong> build a supportive community</strong> - via the Indiegogo platform - of anorexia survivors, sufferers, loved ones of anorexia sufferers and <strong>those interested in understanding more deeply the ups and downs of the recovery from anorexia.</strong></p>
<p>Moreover, <strong>few to no films deal with the path of recovery</strong> from the illness and those which do, still present a <strong>dramatised version far from reality,</strong> favouring drama for entertainment purposes rather than true information.</p>
<p>And of those few films, we’re usually only shown serious, somewhat miserable dramas, further increasing the stigma around anorexia and what is seen as a taboo subject. 'ICE CREAM' is a drama <strong>with dark comedic and lighter moments, as well a visually brighter palate: </strong>we'd like not to alienate our audience, but for them to actually absorb and learn, rather than feeling preached to or overwhelmed.<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1629897395/s6er1ziwziamdbyczwo1.png"" src=""""/></h3>
<p><br/>We need to raise around <strong>£14,000</strong> to cover part of the shoot production and ensure everyone’s safety on set through Indiegogo. </p>
<p>Indiegogo is a vital tool for filmmakers as it enables us to <strong>collaborate with fantastic people like yourself</strong> to make this film a reality. Each member of our team has given a lot of their spare time towards the creation and fine-tuning of 'ICE CREAM':</p>
<p>As a duty of care towards the anorexia community, <strong>we have consulted with both male and female anorexia sufferers and survivors</strong> to gather a variety of different opinions and experiences for our film; we've delved deeper into the script both as a result of these discussions and as new ideas have developed, tweaking phrases and dialogues to suit; we've reached out to members of crew we believe will help us to bring the story to life; we've researched and contacted locations to ensure we will capture the particularly challenging elements within the story... But if we don’t reach our goal, we can’t make this beautiful film. <strong>Every little bit helps and your support is greatly appreciated</strong>. If you can’t donate, sharing our film or crowdfunding link means a lot, as it would enable us to reach a greater number of people and hopefully those who will also resonate with our story.</p>
<p>And as mentioned, we really are hoping to grow an inspired and supportive community of anorexia survivors / anorexia sufferers and their loved ones through this campaign, which is another reason why we've chosen Indiegogo crowdfunding as one of our means of fundraising. <br/> </p>

<ul><li><strong>Director Audrey Gagneux</strong></li></ul>
<p>Audrey is a French and Canadian screenwriter/ director based in London. <br/>After years working in development and production for companies, she is now developing her own projects both in French and in English. Her debut short film, LILY MEETS CHARLIE which starred Tanya Reynolds (Sex Education) and Barry Ward (The End of the F***ing World), premiered at the BAFTA-qualifying Underwire film festival where she was nominated for Best Screenwriter Under 25. The film was released online in August 2020 and has gained over 1.5million views. She’s currently developing a limited series called INSANITY, which was as part of Torino Film Lab’s Next - TV workshop and earned her a writing grant from the CNC (Centre National du Cinéma et de l’Image Animée) in France.</p>
<p>Audrey also chairs the Rising Women working group for Time’s Up UK which aims to give a platform to female talents across all craft for Film &amp; TV, and worked with women's organisation Solace Women's Aid which fight violence against women. Audrey believes her work as a filmmaker goes hand-in-hand with her advocacy work toward intersectional women's rights. That's why, with her projects, she hopes to bring a better intersectional representation of women on screen; where female characters are realistic, flawed and most of all relatable.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Writer Neil Westley</strong></li></ul>
<p>Neil Westley co-wrote the critically acclaimed short film The Truth About Stanley with co-writer/director Lucy Tcherniak (The End of the F*cking World, Wanderlust), produced by Trademark Films.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Story Producer &amp; Lead Actress Ellie Rose Boswell</strong></li></ul>
<p>Ellie was referred to hospital for Anorexia Nervosa in her mid 20s.  Managing to dodge her referral appointment as she simultaneously relocated to the US, Ellie was never contacted about her Anorexia again. Fast forward a few years, recalling life changing diagnoses she had been warned about by continuing to appease her eating disorder, Ellie made a commitment that she, herself, needed to make a change and get better. Her health further declined, however Ellie was actually then on the road to recovery. Five years later, she wrote about her story to Neil. Now, for the first time, Ellie is opening up in more detail about her anorexia experiences, with the hope to create safe, open conversations around anorexia as a mental health illness and dealing with anorexia tendencies in the long term.</p>
<p>Ellie is an actress, film editor &amp; filmmaker. As an actress, Ellie's award winning portrayal of Allison in short film “Itsy” screened at festivals worldwide, including Newport Beach (California) and PostAlley (sponsored by Seattle International Film Festival); Ellie has worked for ""The King of Cannes"" Joe Pytka, alongside Carrie Fisher and George Takei, comedians and writers from SNL &amp; This Is Us; while in theatre, for Olivier award winning director Bob Carlton’s actor-musician repertory company.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Producer Oriane Pick and Candid Broads Productions</strong></li></ul>
<p>Oriane Pick is an actor and producer. In 2019, she produced and starred in the multi award-nominated short drama ‘Say Your Name’, for which she received two nominations as Best Actress. Having dreamt of creating her own series, Oriane is also the co-Showrunner, Executive Producer and one of the lead actresses in short form dramedy “Call It a Day”.

Since the company's creation, she has produced 'Smudged Smile' directed by Ella Greenwood, starring Mia McKenna and 'KOTTI' directed by Fabia Martin, starring Emma Appleton and Anna Savva.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Casting Director Shakyra Dowling</strong></li></ul>

<p>Thank you for your support and let's make this film together.</p>
</div></div>","'Ice Cream' is drawn from our lead actress and story producer Ellie Rose Boswell's own anorexia experiences. The film follows Amy, a woman recovering from anorexia, who gets caught between the illness and her overbearing mother while attempting to buy an ice cream for her young daughter.
We are aiming this film at loved ones of anorexia sufferers or anorexia sufferers who have made a step towards recovery. We want this film to provide a better understanding of how to talk to those suffering, the stumbling blocks both they and their loved ones may encounter along the way and to highlight that recovery isn't a straight forward, bound to succeed avenue. 

 


The portrayal of anorexia in the media has repeatedly been misrepresented, emphasising the illness’s misconceptions and misunderstanding to people who know little to no information. For example, anorexia is often glamorised through film, lending itself to the misconception that anorexia starts from a place of vanity - that it's a shallow problem and not seen as a mental health illness.
'ICE CREAM’ aims to address these misconceptions, promote a more realistic portrayal of someone’s anorexia recovery journey and build a supportive community - via the Indiegogo platform - of anorexia survivors, sufferers, loved ones of anorexia sufferers and those interested in understanding more deeply the ups and downs of the recovery from anorexia.
Moreover, few to no films deal with the path of recovery from the illness and those which do, still present a dramatised version far from reality, favouring drama for entertainment purposes rather than true information.
And of those few films, we’re usually only shown serious, somewhat miserable dramas, further increasing the stigma around anorexia and what is seen as a taboo subject. 'ICE CREAM' is a drama with dark comedic and lighter moments, as well a visually brighter palate: we'd like not to alienate our audience, but for them to actually absorb and learn, rather than feeling preached to or overwhelmed. 


We need to raise around £14,000 to cover part of the shoot production and ensure everyone’s safety on set through Indiegogo. 
Indiegogo is a vital tool for filmmakers as it enables us to collaborate with fantastic people like yourself to make this film a reality. Each member of our team has given a lot of their spare time towards the creation and fine-tuning of 'ICE CREAM':
As a duty of care towards the anorexia community, we have consulted with both male and female anorexia sufferers and survivors to gather a variety of different opinions and experiences for our film; we've delved deeper into the script both as a result of these discussions and as new ideas have developed, tweaking phrases and dialogues to suit; we've reached out to members of crew we believe will help us to bring the story to life; we've researched and contacted locations to ensure we will capture the particularly challenging elements within the story... But if we don’t reach our goal, we can’t make this beautiful film. Every little bit helps and your support is greatly appreciated. If you can’t donate, sharing our film or crowdfunding link means a lot, as it would enable us to reach a greater number of people and hopefully those who will also resonate with our story.
And as mentioned, we really are hoping to grow an inspired and supportive community of anorexia survivors / anorexia sufferers and their loved ones through this campaign, which is another reason why we've chosen Indiegogo crowdfunding as one of our means of fundraising.  

 


 
Director Audrey Gagneux
Audrey is a French and Canadian screenwriter/ director based in London. After years working in development and production for companies, she is now developing her own projects both in French and in English. Her debut short film, LILY MEETS CHARLIE which starred Tanya Reynolds (Sex Education) and Barry Ward (The End of the F***ing World), premiered at the BAFTA-qualifying Underwire film festival where she was nominated for Best Screenwriter Under 25. The film was released online in August 2020 and has gained over 1.5million views. She’s currently developing a limited series called INSANITY, which was as part of Torino Film Lab’s Next - TV workshop and earned her a writing grant from the CNC (Centre National du Cinéma et de l’Image Animée) in France.
Audrey also chairs the Rising Women working group for Time’s Up UK which aims to give a platform to female talents across all craft for Film & TV, and worked with women's organisation Solace Women's Aid which fight violence against women. Audrey believes her work as a filmmaker goes hand-in-hand with her advocacy work toward intersectional women's rights. That's why, with her projects, she hopes to bring a better intersectional representation of women on screen; where female characters are realistic, flawed and most of all relatable.
Writer Neil Westley
Neil Westley co-wrote the critically acclaimed short film The Truth About Stanley with co-writer/director Lucy Tcherniak (The End of the F*cking World, Wanderlust), produced by Trademark Films.
Story Producer & Lead Actress Ellie Rose Boswell
Ellie was referred to hospital for Anorexia Nervosa in her mid 20s.  Managing to dodge her referral appointment as she simultaneously relocated to the US, Ellie was never contacted about her Anorexia again. Fast forward a few years, recalling life changing diagnoses she had been warned about by continuing to appease her eating disorder, Ellie made a commitment that she, herself, needed to make a change and get better. Her health further declined, however Ellie was actually then on the road to recovery. Five years later, she wrote about her story to Neil. Now, for the first time, Ellie is opening up in more detail about her anorexia experiences, with the hope to create safe, open conversations around anorexia as a mental health illness and dealing with anorexia tendencies in the long term.
Ellie is an actress, film editor & filmmaker. As an actress, Ellie's award winning portrayal of Allison in short film “Itsy” screened at festivals worldwide, including Newport Beach (California) and PostAlley (sponsored by Seattle International Film Festival); Ellie has worked for ""The King of Cannes"" Joe Pytka, alongside Carrie Fisher and George Takei, comedians and writers from SNL & This Is Us; while in theatre, for Olivier award winning director Bob Carlton’s actor-musician repertory company.

<h3>#whoisDrNauberger</h3>
<p>Hi, I’m Andras Ostrom, writer-director-producer of Bad Psychiatrist. I’ve been making films since I was about 16 years old, so, roughly half my life... but only short films … This is my first feature. It’s important to me because I’ve always wanted to direct a real movie, but haven’t had a chance. This is it.</p>
<p>We’ve shot 55 minutes, using my own money and that from close friends/family, but now I need help finishing it up. If you contribute you’ll help expand a 55 minute movie into ‘feature film’ range, which is at least 80-90 minutes. That’s the goal. We plan on shooting in November or possibly December. Then we can start submitting to film festivals and find proper distribution.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We need $5,000 to film the additional 30 minutes. It’s mainly going into hiring actors, a cinematographer, a stills photographer, a script supervisor, and locations. I'll do a lot of the other roles myself. Then, when we’re done shooting - I'll need money for prints and advertising (marketing) costs in order to get the word out, and deliverables. Film festivals often require a DCP or digital cinema package and that itself can cost up to $1000 for a film of this length; and distribution companies require a laundry list of deliverables that can cost a lot of money to produce.</p>
<p>We do have perks if you back the film:</p>
<p>$10 - Addition into end credits under “Bad Psychiatrist Fan Club”</p>
<p>$25 - A PDF copy of the script with digitally signed title page sent to you electronically, as well as inclusion in credits under “Bad Psychiatrist Fan Club”</p>
<p>$50 - A full sized printable digital JPG of the movie poster, individually signed and numbered by me, sent to you electronically, as well as inclusion in credits under “Bad Psychiatrist Fan Club”</p>
<p>$75 - One black t-shirt (super soft American Apparel 100% cotton, made in USA) with Bad Psychiatrist title art and brand new Dr. Nauberger doodle, as well as inclusion in credits under ""Bad Psychiatrist Fan Club""</p>
<p>$100 - Inclusion in ‘special thanks’</p>
<p>$500 - Inclusion in credits as ‘Special assistant to Andras Ostrom’</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The story matters to me because it’s a personal story, and I really care about this character of Dr. Nauberger… The project kind of started as a jokey short film, but he’s grown into so much more of a human being. I've personally been through therapy and dealt with certain 'anxiety' much like Dr. Nauberger has, so I want to convey how someone can be helped and that they're not alone. I think at just 55 minutes Dr. Nauberger's story isn’t quite finished, but I don't really want to turn it into a series either. So I think feature length is the way to go. I’d just like to see a few more things in his life resolved.</p>
<p>A few of my previous credits include:</p>
<ul>
<li>12 Variations - successfully funded on IndieGoGo and fully completed. A classical music piano live video recording.</li>
<li>Massive Sonata - another music video</li>
<li>The Cyclist - An award winning (NFFTY Happy Hour Winner, Jay Sanders Film Festival 2nd place) short film about a bike messenger</li>
<li>The Letters - Editor on a feature epic based on the life of Mother Teresa, starring Juliet Stevenson, Rutger Hauer and Max von Sydow</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>My target goal is low for a feature film, even if it is just one third of a feature. But it's in the ballpark of what I think I can raise and we'll work with whatever we can get.</p>
</div><div>

<p>After enjoying his retirement in Florida, carving wood, enjoying the white sand beaches, and dancing to old disco, Uncle Stan (Leslie David Baker) gets a call from his nephew Lucky in Los Angeles asking for help with his two kids and running his motorcycle/flower shop. With his business failing, his kids growing up without enough attention, and on the brink of losing his patience with the cast of characters he has working in the shop, Lucky is going to need all the help he can get from no-nonsense Uncle Stan. </p>

<p> </p>
<p>When Lucky picks up his uncle at LAX in a motorcycle with a sidecar laden with flowers and no room for his luggage, Uncle Stan knows that he will be in for quite the adventure and challenge. With his unique personality and business acumen that he has acquired over decades, Stan is sure to clash once or twice with the wild personalities that Lucky has working in the shop. With his lady friend and soon-to-be fiancé completely in the dark, Uncle Stan must take swift action to make sure that not only his nephew comes out on top, but that he is able to maintain some semblance of his previously comfortable lifestyle moving forward.</p>

<h3>The Project<br/> </h3>
<p>My name is Calvin Romeyn, and I'm an award-winning visual effects artist with over a decade of industry experience.  My work is driven by my passion for using cutting-edge technology to create imagery that captivates, in the service of telling stories that inspire.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1628562651/f4fsoyfstus1ntq0mdkm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>In 2018, I released my first independent project, a crossover fan film titled <i>Galactic Battles.  </i>Featuring characters and settings from my favorite sci-fi franchises, from <i>Star Wars, </i>to<i> Star Trek, </i>to <i>Mass Effect </i>and <i><i>Halo. </i></i>with some of the characters voiced by their original voice actors - the film went viral on YouTube, and now has over five million views:</p>
<div>
<div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/eG9lTgu0R-M?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div><br/><br/>This year, I've begun work on my next project - <i>FIRMWARE, </i>a post-apocalyptic science-fiction short film inspired by the likes of <i>Half-Life 2, </i><i>S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl</i>, and my longtime interest in the real-life exclusion zones around Pripyat and Fukushima.<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1628549762/qkofvod6i83zifohscc5.png"" src=""""/><br/> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Zaraiah, a spunky, vivacious 20-something year old, is desperate to escape the only world she's ever known. Her best hope for liberation- a pessimistic, decommissioned war droid, ""AL-1"". I would love for you to be a part of her quest!</div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1629420989/iz2c1smyqvjxepnegha4.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Created entirely with state-of-the-art motion capture technology in Unreal Engine, <i>FIRMWARE </i>is on the cutting-edge of a new kind of film production  - where performances are captured at a comfortable pace in a controlled studio, without the pressures of long hours and a massive production crew.  Every creative decision can be created, tested, and workshopped in post-production, allowing the story to be perfected like never before.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1628549871/bd1irmrhvhnfmndgvyp5.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>FIRMWARE </i>is set in an alternate 1990 where the adoption of nuclear energy never ended.  Somewhere in Eastern Europe, long after civilization has collapsed and national borders have been forgotten, the walled-off ""Alcazar Exclusion Zone"" has emerged as a small functioning society, a melting pot of survivors from around the world. </p>

<p> </p>
<p>Kept together by an authoritarian government, citizens have almost no freedom in their daily lives, and are constantly fed propaganda that justifies military control under the guise of ""personal safety.""</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>The Inspiration</h3>
<p>Although this is an original work of art, as storytellers, we are always inspired by others. The inspirations for <i>FIRMWARE </i>come from real life photos of the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, <i>Half-Life 2, Children of Men, The Last Of Us</i>, and the artwork of Simon Stålenhag.</p>

<h3>
<br/>The Studio</h3>
<p>I'm excited to announce that we've partnered with Beyond Capture, a full-service performance capture studio in downtown Vancouver (<a href=""https://www.beyond-capture.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.beyond-capture.com</a>). They will be providing the studio space to capture all the required high fidelity data in order to translate the actor's dialogue, motion capture, and facial performances to their representative CG characters.</p>
<p>Beyond shares a physical space with Vancouver Film School, and strongly believes in opening up the field of motion capture technology to students and independent filmmakers.   </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1628743757/fuokacjdi4aqhqqq1toh.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>
<br/>Budget and Perks</h3>
<p>We've already completed our first motion capture shoot, in which we captured the majority of our background characters. The world that Zariah inhabits, along with a majority of the story's props, have already been modeled, textured, and made ready for animation.  The next phase of the project involves capturing the performance of the main cast.<br/><br/>In order to complete this project, we need your help to raise $6000: </p>
<ul>
<li>$4000 for production, including studio fees, transportation, and catering.</li>
<li>$1000 for post-production, including visual effects assets and hardware upgrades.</li>
<li>$1000 for festival applications and distribution, to reach audiences worldwide.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1629423503/tsa4ywgcbl27totmf2hi.png"" src=""""/>
</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>Once we reach our goal, any overflow contributions will be used to purchase additional visual effects assets to use in the film, and to give back to both the team at Beyond Capture and to our post-production team, all who are giving their time to be involved.<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why Support Us?</h3>
<p>Empowering and inspiring fellow creators is a passion of mine, and I love to mentor and to share my technical knowledge and skills with others. <br/><br/>My goal is to use the unique production process behind <i>FIRMWARE </i>to serve as a learning resource for other filmmakers, using in-depth behind-the-scenes breakdowns of our team's use of a ""virtual production"" workflow.  I believe that this technology will become an integral part of our industry's future, and will play a vital role in making the filmmaking process more accessible and more enjoyable for all.<br/><br/>I'm also a strong believer in representation for all.  Vancouver, BC is an incredibly diverse place, where almost every culture in the world has a voice.  The opportunities made available through my work, both for cast and crew, will represent that. <br/> </p>
<p>The final film will be released for free on YouTube, with 100% of all ad revenue being donated to Global Aid Network, a non-profit organization that provides relief for women living in injustice, poverty, and crisis around the world (<a href=""https://globalaid.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://globalaid.net/</a>).<br/> </p>

</div></div>","The Project 
My name is Calvin Romeyn, and I'm an award-winning visual effects artist with over a decade of industry experience.  My work is driven by my passion for using cutting-edge technology to create imagery that captivates, in the service of telling stories that inspire.

 
In 2018, I released my first independent project, a crossover fan film titled Galactic Battles.  Featuring characters and settings from my favorite sci-fi franchises, from Star Wars, to Star Trek, to Mass Effect and Halo. with some of the characters voiced by their original voice actors - the film went viral on YouTube, and now has over five million views:

This year, I've begun work on my next project - FIRMWARE, a post-apocalyptic science-fiction short film inspired by the likes of Half-Life 2, S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl, and my longtime interest in the real-life exclusion zones around Pripyat and Fukushima. 
 
Zaraiah, a spunky, vivacious 20-something year old, is desperate to escape the only world she's ever known. Her best hope for liberation- a pessimistic, decommissioned war droid, ""AL-1"". I would love for you to be a part of her quest!

 
Created entirely with state-of-the-art motion capture technology in Unreal Engine, FIRMWARE is on the cutting-edge of a new kind of film production  - where performances are captured at a comfortable pace in a controlled studio, without the pressures of long hours and a massive production crew.  Every creative decision can be created, tested, and workshopped in post-production, allowing the story to be perfected like never before.

 
FIRMWARE is set in an alternate 1990 where the adoption of nuclear energy never ended.  Somewhere in Eastern Europe, long after civilization has collapsed and national borders have been forgotten, the walled-off ""Alcazar Exclusion Zone"" has emerged as a small functioning society, a melting pot of survivors from around the world. 

 
Kept together by an authoritarian government, citizens have almost no freedom in their daily lives, and are constantly fed propaganda that justifies military control under the guise of ""personal safety.""

 
The Inspiration
Although this is an original work of art, as storytellers, we are always inspired by others. The inspirations for FIRMWARE come from real life photos of the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, Half-Life 2, Children of Men, The Last Of Us, and the artwork of Simon Stålenhag.


 

The Studio
I'm excited to announce that we've partnered with Beyond Capture, a full-service performance capture studio in downtown Vancouver (https://www.beyond-capture.com). They will be providing the studio space to capture all the required high fidelity data in order to translate the actor's dialogue, motion capture, and facial performances to their representative CG characters.
Beyond shares a physical space with Vancouver Film School, and strongly believes in opening up the field of motion capture technology to students and independent filmmakers.   



 

Budget and Perks
We've already completed our first motion capture shoot, in which we captured the majority of our background characters. The world that Zariah inhabits, along with a majority of the story's props, have already been modeled, textured, and made ready for animation.  The next phase of the project involves capturing the performance of the main cast.In order to complete this project, we need your help to raise $6000: 

$4000 for production, including studio fees, transportation, and catering.
$1000 for post-production, including visual effects assets and hardware upgrades.
$1000 for festival applications and distribution, to reach audiences worldwide.


Once we reach our goal, any overflow contributions will be used to purchase additional visual effects assets to use in the film, and to give back to both the team at Beyond Capture and to our post-production team, all who are giving their time to be involved. 

Why Support Us?
Empowering and inspiring fellow creators is a passion of mine, and I love to mentor and to share my technical knowledge and skills with others. My goal is to use the unique production process behind FIRMWARE to serve as a learning resource for other filmmakers, using in-depth behind-the-scenes breakdowns of our team's use of a ""virtual production"" workflow.  I believe that this technology will become an integral part of our industry's future, and will play a vital role in making the filmmaking process more accessible and more enjoyable for all.I'm also a strong believer in representation for all.  Vancouver, BC is an incredibly diverse place, where almost every culture in the world has a voice.  The opportunities made available through my work, both for cast and crew, will represent that.  
The final film will be released for free on YouTube, with 100% of all ad revenue being donated to Global Aid Network, a non-profit organization that provides relief for women living in injustice, poverty, and crisis around the world (https://globalaid.net/).

<h2><u>How did it start?</u></h2>
<p><i><strong>Dimeji wanted to explore a story about the effects trauma has on fathers and the issues they face when attempting to connect with their children. During the pandemic he shared the story with Shola and together, the two of them started writing the script. </strong></i> We believe that this project is so important. We organized a table read soon after completing the script and the reactions to Malik's story were overwhelming. This story has touched the hearts of so many people who have read the script so far.</p>
<h2><u>What is this film about?</u></h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1631476165/pofgoycqb1icvymm6hi2.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i><strong>This film is about Malik</strong></i>, a first-time dad, to a beautiful little girl. He is experiencing parenting for the first time with his successful wife. Malik loves his daughter but because of his deep painful trauma he can't bring himself to connect with her. When the film begins Malik is about to make a dark, life-altering decision concerning this, while his daughter is in his care. What he decides to do will not only alter his own life but those around him. As he tries to rise above his own trauma to be a better man and father to his child, we are led to an ending that is unexpected and shocking...yet hopeful.  <i><strong>Your contribution to the making of this film would give a voice to so many new fathers who are not given the space to process their traumas and also talk about the fears they have about fatherhood. </strong></i>We hope to share this film with communities and engage community members in conversations around the challenges with parenting while trying to be the best fathers they can be.</p>
<h2><u>Why do we want to make his film?</u></h2>
<p>This film provides a space to present various issues men face, especially, while navigating expectations thrusted onto them concerning their role as ""protector"".

<h3><strong>Thank you!</strong></h3>
</div></div>","A new father, in the midst of a life altering decision, is sidetracked when his daughter is thrust into his care.

How did it start?
Dimeji wanted to explore a story about the effects trauma has on fathers and the issues they face when attempting to connect with their children. During the pandemic he shared the story with Shola and together, the two of them started writing the script.  We believe that this project is so important. We organized a table read soon after completing the script and the reactions to Malik's story were overwhelming. This story has touched the hearts of so many people who have read the script so far.
What is this film about?

This film is about Malik, a first-time dad, to a beautiful little girl. He is experiencing parenting for the first time with his successful wife. Malik loves his daughter but because of his deep painful trauma he can't bring himself to connect with her. When the film begins Malik is about to make a dark, life-altering decision concerning this, while his daughter is in his care. What he decides to do will not only alter his own life but those around him. As he tries to rise above his own trauma to be a better man and father to his child, we are led to an ending that is unexpected and shocking...yet hopeful.  Your contribution to the making of this film would give a voice to so many new fathers who are not given the space to process their traumas and also talk about the fears they have about fatherhood. We hope to share this film with communities and engage community members in conversations around the challenges with parenting while trying to be the best fathers they can be.
Why do we want to make his film?
This film provides a space to present various issues men face, especially, while navigating expectations thrusted onto them concerning their role as ""protector"". We want explore the conflict men face balancing vulnerability and masculinity; all while trying to be good fathers to their children. By telling this story we look at the challenges some men experience trying to keep their children safe from a world and experiences that have negatively impacted their fathers and the burden that presents. It provides an opportunity for men of all races to also think about the relationships they have with their children and the desire to protect them from the effects of their own trauma. 


What is the money going to be used for?
In addition to applying for grants and sourcing for in kind donations we are working to raising $10,000 dollars towards the production of this film on Indiegogo.   
With the help of our amazing team of creatives, crew, and actors. We are aiming for a three-day shoot in Orlando, Fl. Our locations are set and our actors are ready to go.
Funding for the film will:

Rent equipment (lighting kits, audio equipment, etc.)

Pay actors & crew
COVID safety (daily masks, renting space to keep people who have been tested)
Post-production (color grading and sound mixing specifically)
Licenses and insurance

<h3>""So, what the heck is TRIVIAL?""</h3>
<p>TRIVIAL is a revenge based horror thriller written and directed by James L. Edwards(HER NAME WAS CHRISTA, BRIMSTONE INCORPORATED) that can best be described as the most twisted gameshow ever aired. Six strangers awaken to find themselves chained to chairs in a makeshift studio and forced into a bizarre televised trivia contest. Get the answers correct, they advance to the next round. Get the answers wrong and suffer grave consequences. </p>
<p>Our goal is to begin pre-production on the film in fall of this year with a projected release date of spring 2022, We hope to raise $10K on this campaign to put towards the budget. That's where you come in and I gotta tell you, we've got some fantastic perks in store for you.</p>
<h3>""Why do you want to make this movie so badly?""</h3>
<p>Quite frankly, I'm in love with the story. Since I began directing my own films, I've tried incredibly hard to not only stay within the horror genre, but also add elements of drama and dark comedy within the story. TRIVIAL is no exception, but it also will give me the opportunity to do something extremely gruesome. I believe it's an incredibly unique screenplay and, along with our phenomenally talented cast and crew, will be able to give horror audiences exactly what they have been craving.</p>
<h3>""Who stars in this movie?""</h3>

<p>Whether it be Indiana Jones or Back to The Future, adventure films have always been fun to us. <strong>We wanted to create a story with its own world and its own mythology behind it</strong> but has these characters really rooted into its history like Indiana Jones or Harry Potter. <strong>It’s a mash-up of those two mediums.

However, this still <strong>a story about closure and about the acceptance of death</strong>, even when you have the ability to reverse it.</p>We also believe <strong>this will give a new set of adventures to a younger generation</strong>. We think this could lead to more stories and adventures from the perspectives of the underdogs and is just <strong>the building block for a grand world that we hope to continue sharing with you throughout the years</strong>, but first, we want to prove we can do it. <strong>With your help, we will be one step closer. </strong>

1) Every donation made is going to be used in ways that utilize the local businesses where we intend to film as well as giving exposure to the area as more tourism begins opening back up.
2) You'll be helping us feed the cast and crew to no expense to them, as well as allowing us to expand and develop our skills. Your support really rocks, seriously. So thank you.
3) We have always been fans of the adventure genre.
Whether it be Indiana Jones or Back to The Future, adventure films have always been fun to us. We wanted to create a story with its own world and its own mythology behind it but has these characters really rooted into its history like Indiana Jones or Harry Potter. It’s a mash-up of those two mediums. The heart and the charm. 
Diversity will also be forward-facing. We hope to create an adventure of the magical world using the lens of a female perspective and BIPOC stories with world-building, which we hope will flip the anticipated story tropes, and explore other stories within established genre types. However, this still a story about closure and about the acceptance of death, even when you have the ability to reverse it.We also believe this will give a new set of adventures to a younger generation. We think this could lead to more stories and adventures from the perspectives of the underdogs and is just the building block for a grand world that we hope to continue sharing with you throughout the years, but first, we want to prove we can do it. With your help, we will be one step closer.",12.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p><strong>HBFilms and TrashArts Productions are proud to announce that they will be making a UK Slasher Horror feature film: ""<i><u>Terror At Black Tree Forest</u></i>"". This is an authorised reboot of a film originally made by the highly acclaimed US based genre film maker, Dustin Ferguson.<br/><br/><u>Who are we?</u></strong><br/>HBFilms and Trash Arts Productions are renowned as being highly prolific producers of horror feature films including ""<i>Lonely Hearts</i>"", ""<i>The Millennial Killer</i>"", ""<i>The Truth Will Out</i>"", ""<i>Monstrous Disunion</i>"", ""<i>Senseless</i>"" and many more.<br/><br/><u><strong>Why are we doing this?</strong></u><br/>We were, and are, honoured to have been asked by Dustin to remake his film. Originally he asked in 2018 and we were about to launch a crowdfunding campaign for the production costs at the start of 2020 - but held back whilst the covid pandemic took its course. Despite the pandemic, we were able to reschedule another feature, ""Senseless"", for production between UK lockdowns and remaining covid-secure, following all UK production guidelines, with no adverse effects on any of the cast and crew for that film. Now we are finally able to see a way of making this horror slasher, ""<strong><i>Terror at Black Tree Forest</i></strong>"", whilst remaining cautious and following production guidelines but we are now confident that we will be able to complete the, mainly outdoor, shoot safely and within a reasonable timeframe this summer (2021).<br/><br/>Past crowdfunding campaigns have been 100%+ supported and we are hopeful that you will be able to make this crowdfunding campaign a equally successful so that we can make ""<strong><i>Terror At Black Tree Forest</i></strong>"" our very first 'whodunnit'  horror slasher feature.</p>
<p><b><u>Stretch Goal</u></b></p>
<p>It's great to be able to see that we have achieved our initial funding target. So many people have supported us, and we thank all of them for that, and now we know we will be able to fully film everything we need to make sure that ""<i><strong>Terror At Black Tree Forest</strong></i>"" is a success. </p>
<p>But we want to go further. The amount funded is only about half of the Budget that we have agreed upon, and we want to add more! We are now adding our stretch target - if we can achieve another £1,000 on this funder, making a total of £4,000, then we will add an extra kill, a very special one. The extra kill will be played by Sam Mason Bell, the director, and will undoubtedly be the bloodiest, messiest, and slasher-ist death that we can come up with in association with our brilliant Make Up Artist, Katie Johnson, and fully in keeping with the the way our Slasher Killer works.</p>
<p>So, please, lets work to £4,000 and let's get messy!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><u><strong>Our Plan</strong></u></p>
<p>We are anticipating being able to complete the main shoot in five days at Hollybanks Woods and other locations in and around Portsmouth, Hampshire (UK). The shoot itself is budgeted to be around £6,500 / US$9,000.  Of that, about 50% is to pay for the Cast and Crew, 25% for costumes, props, and catering, and about 25% on other necessities such as insurance, covid testing, and post production!  <br/><br/>The Budget for this film is in line with our previous films so we know that we can achieve a good horror film that will be of interest to our fan base, Dustin's fan base, and one that we, and hopefully you, will be proud of.</p>
<p><strong><u>Your Reward</u></strong></p>
<p>We do hope that you will be able to support us and, in return, we are offering some good perks above the usual ""thank you"" on social media and ""here's a copy of the film you helped to make"".</p>
<p>Those are available too, of course, but we are also giving you the opportunity to own the Killer's mask, the Killer's costume, and a even a fake eyeball (spoiler: one of the character's has their eye popped out on the end of a knife.... not a spoiler: we're not telling you who!). Those items will all be 'as seen on screen' and we will even get the killer (whoever they are...) to sign and personalise their mask and costume. You can even choose to name one of the characters!</p>
<p>Have a look at the 'Rewards' for more details!</p>
<p><u><strong>Our Backup</strong></u></p>
<p>So we've said our Budget is around £6,500, but the crowd funder target is far less! We hope that we will achieve at least our target but we do have some stretch goals in mind that we will announce once we hit our initial goal. We really would like to achieve double our target and be able to fully fund the film production but, if we don't, here's what we will be planning to do.</p>
<p>Firstly, we will use all funds we receive on hitting the screen with the story, the kills, and the slasher killer to the best of our ability. If we need to make the kills smaller, or work around how messy we can make them, then we will and we know we can still give a decent story on screen.</p>
<p>Secondly, we have a great potential backer in place, renowned for their love of the horror genre and a supporter many previous films. They have underwritten this project to make sure it happens - but we'd really like to not take advantage of them, and with your help, we won't!</p>
<p>Thirdly, our cast and crew are great. We've built in an allowance for a daily rate above what we have paid in the past. We really, really, don't want to reduce that rate but if we don't achieve the full funding target then we may have to - but we know our cast and crew are dedicated and will help us with that. And we have built in the cost of having an additional pair of hands available 'behind the camera' (a production assistant) but we will be able to work everything out without that individual being required. ​</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What do we aim to achieve?</h3>
<p>We haven't made a true 'slasher horror' before so we are very much looking forward to adding ""<strong><i>Terror At Black Tree Forest</i></strong>"" into the great British pantheon of slasher films. With your help we can achieve that and continue to ensure that British Horror is held in the same high regard in the 21st Century as it has been for the 60 years or more.</p>
<p>We've worked for Dustin Ferguson before with short films and know that they have been very well received by him and his fan base in the United States - so this slasher killer feature film will be the first full length movie for him, and SRS Entertainment, and will be released by them on Video on Demand and Physical Media in 2022 (or possibly earlier).</p>
<p>Of our previous projects, one has been distributed by Troma Entertainment and six (yes, 6) have been distributed by Darkside Releasing. That doesn't mean we are making 'mega-bucks' but it does absolutely mean that other people, of influence in the film / movie world. have watched our past films and found them good enough to get out into the wider world. You're not being asked to support first time filmmakers with this project!</p>
<p>Past films have also received various awards from, and screenings at, film festivals in the UK, US, and around the world. We wouldn't have been successful unless film festival directors and selection panels liked our work. No independent film making team can truly say you will be backing a sure fire hit, and we aren't saying that about ourselves or this film, but we believe we have the skills and strengths to make ""<i><strong>Terror At Black Tree Forest</strong></i>"" a strong film that will not disappoint.<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The UK Film Industry, and other creative / entertainment / hospitality, industries have really suffered over the past year. The Film Industry has issued guidelines on producing feature films during the pandemic, and we were able to create ""<i>Senseless</i>"" in between lockdowns in the UK. That enabled us to lift our game with ensuring the safety of the cast and crew (no more than six people at anyone time on location, multitasking behind the camera, and re-arranging our shoot plan to reduce the risks for all, as well as daily temperature checks and covid awareness briefings). We also upskilled in our ability to shoot on location, away from electricity and at night, and gained invaluable knowledge with green screen filming.</p>
<p>We know that we will face similar risks on this shoot. So we will be doing very similar - covid testing, shoot planning, reducing risk wherever possible, and maintaining the production guidelines. Whilst the UK may be out of lockdown by the time we start to shoot, we will remain as cautious as we were in 2020.</p>
<p>We have already revisited the script since last year and ensured that cast members are comfortable with the script and any close work with others. Our make up artist is, now, experienced, with working in personal protective equipment and will, if necessary, be doing the same for this production. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Who is our cast and crew?</h3>We will be posting updates during the campaign about our great cast and crew, working with some new faces to the TrashArts / HB Films team as well as working with those who have worked with us before. <br/><br/>The Indie Horror community in the UK is a great place to be - so much talent in front and behind the screen - and we are keen to tell you who we have working with us so <i><u>watch this space</u></i>!<br/><br/> </div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Look, we know that some people just can't contribute much, but that doesn't mean you can't help us! Just by being here and reading this helps us.</p>
<p>Even if you can only contribute £5, it will make a difference.</p>
<p>And if you really can't then we'd like to just mention that funding campaigns really fly when they are talked about. If you can, mention us in your social media activity, share our campaign link, and return to it in a couple of days to share again. Every visit to this page does really make a difference for us!<br/><br/>But, at the end of it all is just a very simple statement that is meant wholeheartedly by all of us involved with ""<strong><i>Terror at Black Tree Forest</i></strong>"":</p>
<p><i><strong>Thank you for reading this, stay safe, and have a great day!<br/>Oh, and, whatever you do, do not go down to the Black Tree Forest alone! </strong></i><br/> </p>
