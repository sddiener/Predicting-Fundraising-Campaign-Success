      We began developing the Easycarb SmartScale with portability and
      reliability in mind. Once we had the initial concept on paper, we
      presented it to local </span><span style=""color: #4d4d4f;""> diabetes
      communities, who helped us tailor it to the needs of the users. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443258632/dk8zuqnjo1y9ypn5afjk.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 620px; height: 428px;""/><br/>
      We realized that the scale should be big enough to make weighing
      convenient for all kinds of foods, but should be kept small enough to fit
      into any pocket, to keep it both discrete and fully portable.<br/>
<br/>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443258646/pq88jcibv10ieh2dhsae.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>
<br/>
<br/>
      The scale features an extremely precise load cell sensor capable of
      detecting even the slightest difference in pressure. But just to be on a
      safe side, it will come equipped with a pressure overload safety
      mechanism, so you don't ever have to worry about it breaking down. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
      After months of rigorous testing at least a dozen variations we are proud
      to introduce the final version of the Easycarb SmartScale. We are
      convinced it's colourful, sleek design will captivate anyone who lays
      their hands and eyes on it – and its sturdy build will ensure it lasts. We
      also equipped it with a powerful coin battery and a smart automatic on/off
      mechanism, which eliminates the need for pesky cables and will provide
      months of smooth, reliable operation.<br/>

          world's first complete carb tracker for diabetics.

      Easycarb is the first complete solution for tracking carbohydrates,
      intended to make the process simple, accurate and efficient. It consists
      of a powerful app combined with a dedicated portable Bluetooth scale,
      which together automatically calculate the exact amount of carbs in a
      given meal, no matter where you are.

 


 




  

Total portability
Take control of your carbs wherever
              you go with the Bluetooth SmartScale. We designed it with
              portability and comfort in mind, and its long-life battery will
              provide you with months of smooth operation.




  

Cloud-based food database
The heart of the app is a
              comprehensive cloud-based food database that displays and logs
              nutritional information for basic, whole foods as well as prepared
              dishes.




  

Nutritional value calculator
The integrated Easycarb nutrition
              calculator provides users with accurate carbohydrate, fibre and
              other nutritional values for every meal – like never before
              possible.




  

Insulin dosing recommendation
The app instantly provides the user
              with precise corresponding insulin values for every meal, based on
              the user's insulin sensitivity profile.




  

PDF report exporter
The powerful integrated logger enables
              the user to export a personalised PDF report to share with their
              physician or caregiver.











 

   Step one


 The scale weighs the item and sends
              the data to the mobile app via Bluetooth.















  Step two

Select the same food article on the
              app, which automatically
                calculates the number of carbs and insulin values. 











  Step three

 Powerful logger logs everything, so
              you don't have to.
 



 



 
 
      We began developing the Easycarb SmartScale with portability and
      reliability in mind. Once we had the initial concept on paper, we
      presented it to local  diabetes
      communities, who helped us tailor it to the needs of the users. 
      We realized that the scale should be big enough to make weighing
      convenient for all kinds of foods, but should be kept small enough to fit
      into any pocket, to keep it both discrete and fully portable.




      The scale features an extremely precise load cell sensor capable of
      detecting even the slightest difference in pressure. But just to be on a
      safe side, it will come equipped with a pressure overload safety
      mechanism, so you don't ever have to worry about it breaking down. 

 

      After months of rigorous testing at least a dozen variations we are proud
      to introduce the final version of the Easycarb SmartScale. We are
      convinced it's colourful, sleek design will captivate anyone who lays
      their hands and eyes on it – and its sturdy build will ensure it lasts. We
      also equipped it with a powerful coin battery and a smart automatic on/off
      mechanism, which eliminates the need for pesky cables and will provide
      months of smooth, reliable operation.

 



 




 



We are a young, committed interdisciplinary
      team of experts from various sciences; biomedical professionals and
      researchers, programmers and developers, together with accomplished
      industrial and graphic designers. We believe interdisciplinary knowledge and sharing of experience and expertise
      produces the best results; but most of all, we are convinced we can
      revolutionize the way carbohydrates are managed and make people's lives
      better.


 

Like what we do and what we stand for? There
      are many ways how you can help us out. Spread the word about Easycarb on
      social media, join our newsletter or publish a story about us in your
      awesome magazine or blog. Thanks!

<h3>What Happened</h3>
<p>On Christmas Eve Mary and our Dad were walking from their car to midnight service at our church in Atlanta when two men approached them, fired a gun and stole their wallet, purse, and cell phones. </p>
<p>Mary had just recently received a brand new iPhone 4s for graduation, and as a student at UGA isn't in a position to buy a new one. Right now she's using one of our Dad's old phones and is perfectly content with it. </p>
<p>The police are working on tracking down the robbers, but it's very unlikely any property would ever be recovered.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>Although Mary hasn't asked for anyone to replace her phone, it upsets me that she had to endure a tramautic event like this, on Christmas Eve no less, and I would like to try and replace the phone for her. As it turns out, these iPhones are awfully expensive when your contract isn't up for renewal, and I'm not in a position to spend $550 on a brand new phone for her.</p>
<p>If, AND ONLY IF, you are in a position to contribute, I would love to see if her friends and family can pool together a small portion of their respective earnings to cover the expense of a new iPhone 4s. If we are able to exceed the goal I've set $550, then I will use the extra money to get her the best iPhone available.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Mary has no idea I'm setting this fund up, and I hope all of you will do your best to keep it that way. You may only be able to chip in $10, $5 or even $1, but if enough of us join together, we can remind my little sister that there is more good out there than evil.</p>
<p>I have set this group to expire in 30 days (early February) and if my goal of $550 isn't reached by that time, any money you contribute will be automatically refunded to your account. </p>

<h1>The Story Behind IPHOXY TV .</h1>
<p>We here at iphoxy accessories are really passionate about technology and new products, and we always hoped and tried to make people's lifes easier</p>
<p>with the amount of new technology that is being made every day,  we really wanted<br/>to add our own touch into the technology world, our first trial was with the projector X , the projector X  was accomplished after a lot of hard work and dedication that we worked on for 2 years , but it didn't go well  because the manufacturing price was too high so we stopped our campaign after 2 days of launching it ,so now we came up with a new concept with a similar idea called IPHOXY TV ,</p>

<br/><h2>Competitors ????</h2>
<div>
<p>Despite the best efforts of Panasonic, Samsung, Sony, LG and
others, most of the televisions in people's homes these days are not of the
smart variety. However, there are hundreds of millions of regular televisions
packing HDMI ports, and IPHOXY’S new IPHOXY TV<span> </span>device offers a way to put some brains
into those dumb TVs by giving them access to web-based content. Having AN
IPHOXY TV dongle connected to your TV means you can stream videos straight from
a Google Play, Netflix or YouTube app, or mirror the content from any device by
any device it means phone tablet PCs whether its apple android or windows.</p>
<p>sure, we've seen devices with some identical functionality, like plair , Chrome cast ,air tame, and others more. But IPHOXY TV it’s the first of its kind
to have android software mirroring and casting from other devices like
phones tablets and PCs (apple android windows ) ,not to mention the affordable
price of $84, is it a worthy addition to your living room? and is it really
""the easiest way to enjoy online videos and music on your TV""</p>

WHAT IS IPHOXY TV ?
 IPHOXY TV is the best HDMI dongle ever made ,that will turn your dumb TV into         a smart TV. It’s a wifi display dongle with 4.4 android software built in  and our own coded special software, and it also has a mirroring function from all devices (phones tablets PCs) windows android and apple  .
Mirroring simply means that you will be able to display the content of your phone tablet  or computer to a bigger screen with a touch of button .

IPHOXY TV runs on a Dual core RK3188 CPU  that will make the system run smoothly with no interruption, and you will be   able to view it on 2k - 4k screens, A sleek design that’s truly revolutionary , you are getting a full HD display from this little tiny device ,



The Story Behind IPHOXY TV .
We here at iphoxy accessories are really passionate about technology and new products, and we always hoped and tried to make people's lifes easier
with the amount of new technology that is being made every day,  we really wantedto add our own touch into the technology world, our first trial was with the projector X , the projector X  was accomplished after a lot of hard work and dedication that we worked on for 2 years , but it didn't go well  because the manufacturing price was too high so we stopped our campaign after 2 days of launching it ,so now we came up with a new concept with a similar idea called IPHOXY TV ,



Solving a Problem !!!

we have all
been there , facing huge TVs with small brains ,or connection problems with
wires cables and devices for the sake of multiple viewing , and this is what we
started working on here at iphoxy ,  a device that connects to phones
,  tablets and PCs and  by itself smart , with android 4.4 built in that is compatible to connect wirelessly with
all platforms ,

Windows ( xp 7 vista 8 and 8.1).

Competitors ????

Despite the best efforts of Panasonic, Samsung, Sony, LG and
others, most of the televisions in people's homes these days are not of the
smart variety. However, there are hundreds of millions of regular televisions
packing HDMI ports, and IPHOXY’S new IPHOXY TV device offers a way to put some brains
into those dumb TVs by giving them access to web-based content. Having AN
IPHOXY TV dongle connected to your TV means you can stream videos straight from
a Google Play, Netflix or YouTube app, or mirror the content from any device by
any device it means phone tablet PCs whether its apple android or windows.
sure, we've seen devices with some identical functionality, like plair , Chrome cast ,air tame, and others more. But IPHOXY TV it’s the first of its kind
to have android software mirroring and casting from other devices like
phones tablets and PCs (apple android windows ) ,not to mention the affordable
price of $84, is it a worthy addition to your living room? and is it really
""the easiest way to enjoy online videos and music on your TV""




yes we believe so!!!







why we need your help
?
We
have the whole manufacturing plan ready that will soon be
ready for production. Though we have big ambitions, we are a small company and
only have the capacity to finance modest production runs.  Placing an
order of multiple thousands of units is beyond our grasp.  
This is where you
come in.  You can help us to increase the amount of product we can order
from the factory as well as accelerate the speed with which we can get it into
the homes of our customers. Your support will make this possible and will be a
vital spark in growing a company obsessed with creating the best products ever.

<p><b>ALEX YOO BIO - FOUNDER</b></p>
<p>Originally from the suburbs of Chicago and currently residing in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn, Alex Yoo earned his first professional experience in the fast-paced financial world of Wall Street. For five years, he plied his trade diligently at Houlihan Lokey, Nomura Securities and Tri Artisan Partners.</p>
<p>However, he soon grew restless with the repetitive PowerPoint presentations and Excel sheets, so he decided to make a change. His next venture came about as a matter of necessity. A habitual sharp dresser, he’d always had difficulty finding dress shirts that worked for his body frame. He took a bold risk and launched an online custom shirt company called Alexander West. He poured all his energy and resources into the business, and Alexander West is presently an established player in the NYC custom clothing market.</p>
<p>Alex’s newest project is a tech venture called Dos Owls. The idea stemmed from a desire to enjoy his NetFlix/Hulu content on a more compact, multi-functional device. The first Dos Owls product is called ODIN, and it has several distinct features including an Android processor, portable theater-like viewing, wireless connectivity, exceptional sound output and innovative design.</p>

<h3>ODIN DEVELOPMENT STORY</h3>
<p>Alex Yoo:</p>
<p>The initial concept for what is now the Dos Owls ODIN first appeared about two years ago and I started working on developing ODIN in the Spring of 2013. Since I did not come from a technology / engineering background, I had to teach my self the basics of mechanical, industrial, optical, and electrical engineering in addition to design for manufacturing and software development (firmware/OS/application). </p>
<p>First, I attended as many hardware workshops as possible (e.g., Hardware Innovation Workshop by MAKE and Hardware Workshop organized by Marc Barros) and talked to anyone that was in hardware technology development as well as a lot of relevant reading. I also started attending relevant Meetup groups around the NYC area and joined Hack Manhattan hackerspace to hang around technology enthusiasts and makers.</p>
<p>The biggest development hurdle in the beginning was finding skilled and experienced engineers who could develop ODIN in addition to being economically feasible.  Due to limited resources, I looked to Asia. With persistence, patience and many trips to Asia, I created connections to talented and experienced Chinese engineers and manufacturers. Shezhen, China has an amazing infrastructure of experienced engineers and electronic production facilities that can't be compared to anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Our first prototype, based on a dual-core microprocessor, failed to meet our high expectations for performance and user experience. Therefore, we are currently upgrading all of our hardware specifications (to quad-core, more RAM, Bluetooth 4.0, among others) to have robust performance using Andorid 4.4 KitKat operating system. </p>

How Does ODIN Work?

ODIN combines an Android powered PC, state-of-the-art projector, Bluetooth speakers and WiFi in a compact, portable gadget. It is battery operated and can meet the demands of today's digital consumers and creators who value mobility and freedom.
OPTICAL DISPLAYContains state-of-the-art DMD optical technology that beams powerful LED light and a large screen size. 

Place ODIN 1 yard away from the wall, and it displays a 25” screen size
Place it 10 yards away for a 250"" screen size.
ODIN's optical lens is so strong, you can see the projected screen with normal indoor lighting at up to 45"" screen size, which is bigger than most flat screen TVs.


KITKAT ANDROID OS
Our intuitive user interface allows for simple navigation and organization of all your apps. ODIN uses a quad-core Android microprocessor and KitKat operating system, which provides access to over 1 million Android apps.  

Home Page (Preliminary)

Settings Page (Preliminary)

CONNECTIVITY
ODIN includes array of connection methods. Built in WiFi wirelessly connects to the Internet as well as a phone’s hotspot. Embedded Bluetooth allows for easy communication between external Bluetooth speakers, keyboard, mouse, and other accessories. ODIN has an HDMI port to connect to XBOX or Playstation, two USB drives for a keyboard, mouse, or flash drives, and a headphone plug.


BLUETOOTH SPEAKERS

ODIN has two play modes:
A: Full projector mode using the projector, speakers and access to Android appsB: Bluetooth speaker mode for streaming music from your phone directly to the two speakers  


ODIN sports two 4-watt Bluetooth speakers (to compare, iPhone 5 has one 0.8 watt speaker).
BATTERY
ODIN's battery provides about two (2) hours of run-time in portable mode. For extended viewing and charging, just connect ODIN to an outlet with the included power cord. 

FUNCTIONAL DESIGN
ODIN is designed with flexibility in mind. Beam onto a wall, or rotate the head 90 degrees and display content on the ceiling for a truly unique viewing experience. (Patent Pending)

ODIN DEVELOPMENT STORY
Alex Yoo:
The initial concept for what is now the Dos Owls ODIN first appeared about two years ago and I started working on developing ODIN in the Spring of 2013. Since I did not come from a technology / engineering background, I had to teach my self the basics of mechanical, industrial, optical, and electrical engineering in addition to design for manufacturing and software development (firmware/OS/application). 
First, I attended as many hardware workshops as possible (e.g., Hardware Innovation Workshop by MAKE and Hardware Workshop organized by Marc Barros) and talked to anyone that was in hardware technology development as well as a lot of relevant reading. I also started attending relevant Meetup groups around the NYC area and joined Hack Manhattan hackerspace to hang around technology enthusiasts and makers.
The biggest development hurdle in the beginning was finding skilled and experienced engineers who could develop ODIN in addition to being economically feasible.  Due to limited resources, I looked to Asia. With persistence, patience and many trips to Asia, I created connections to talented and experienced Chinese engineers and manufacturers. Shezhen, China has an amazing infrastructure of experienced engineers and electronic production facilities that can't be compared to anywhere in the world.
Our first prototype, based on a dual-core microprocessor, failed to meet our high expectations for performance and user experience. Therefore, we are currently upgrading all of our hardware specifications (to quad-core, more RAM, Bluetooth 4.0, among others) to have robust performance using Andorid 4.4 KitKat operating system.

ODIN can be a Bluetooth speaker when it is not projecting anything. It will replace the Pill, Jambox, etc.
Also, lumen figures can be very deceiving. It is never consistent from one projector to a another.


Is ODIN compatible with iOS?


Can ODIN screenshare with my mobile device?
ODIN supports Android's native Miracast. For iOS, see below.

Yes, ODIN is currently capable of streaming audio from iOS via Bluetooth and using your iOS device as a mobile hotspot. Wirelessly streaming photos and videos from iOS is on our roadmap. While we don't have a set date, ODIN's software is upgradeable to provide it with enhancements and improvements.

What is ODIN's resolution?
ODIN displays at 854 × 480 pixels (WVGA). Please see update #1 where we stream Netflix to see the optical quality.


What is ODIN's battery life?
ODIN will run for 2 hours in Projector Mode (projector, speakers, and access to Android apps) and 8 hours in Speaker Mode (audio only + Bluetooth). The battery will not be user replaceable.


Does ODIN support keystoning?
ODIN was made for direct straight shots and direct ceiling shots. It does not have keystoning for angles.


What is the lifespan of the bulb?
ODIN's LED lifespan is good for 20,000 hours. This equals 2.25 years of continuous playback. 


What is the warranty on ODIN?
ODIN comes with Dos Owls' standard one year warranty on parts and labor for manufacturer defects from the date of shipment.


Will I be able to update the version of Android on ODIN?
Yes. ODIN will ship with KitKat/Android 4.4, but we are designing a software update push through capability. 99.5% is Android. 0.5% is to make it more aesthetically inviting and functional for a big screen experience.


Will ODIN be compatible with my country?
Yes, we will send the correct AC plug for your specified country.


Does ODIN support HDCP?
This is on our roadmap but currently more testing needs to be done.


Can I run Steambox on ODIN?
Unfortunately, no, but we are currently exploring this option for future versions.",28.0,2,"1 Campaign

<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">How often do you dial someone, only to realize it's was not a good time to call. With EmotiDial, you no longer have to be worried about this. Before you dial someone, just check what mood that person is in. Similarly, when you receive a call, the caller's mood will also be indicated, so you decide if you really wish to take that call.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">If you are in a mood for a movie, just check who else is in the same mood as you, then dial from within the App, using our innovative Dialer Dashboard. You can update your mood as often as you like  and also design and upload your own moods for private use  - or publish them online for all to use. </span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">You can also upload all your Contacts on our Cloud and restore them to any phone at any time you wish. Upgrading your phone, or moving across platforms (e.g. from iOS to Android or vice versa)? No worries, just download the EmotiDial App on your new phone and simply LogIn and click on Restore and you are done! No more wasting hours on trying to copy your Address Book to a new phone/OS. EmotiDial makes managing your Contacts a breeze - and does it much more securely too.</span></p>

<p><b>Never worry about your Contacts/Address Book ever again</b></p>We all change our phones once in a while and the biggest challenge is to transfer or copy our Contacts/Address Book to the new phone. With EmotiDial this is no longer an issue as you can create, backup and restore all your Contacts on and from the Cloud. The EmotiDial cloud also supports restoring Contacts across different Operating Systems; so for instance, if you wish to migrate from iOS to Android, simply backup your Contacts using your iOS Phone, and restore all the Contacts to your new Android.  For added security, you can also backup all Contact data from the Cloud to your own SD Card if you so desire.

</div>Our Indiegogo Campaign is designed to help make EmotiDial available to everyone globally who has a Smart Phone; and the Funds we raise will help us to specifically achieve the following goals:
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">More quickly migrate from Testing Phase (Beta)  to a fully functional app - that will be available for download globally.</span></li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Broaden our prospective user-base by adding iOS, Windows and other versions of EmotiDial. Currently we can only support Android, (which is circa 85% of all Smart phone owners).  With your help, we wish to make this available to <i>every smart phone owner in every country in the world.</i></span></li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Enable FREE VOIP Calls and Messaging - just like Viber and Whatsapp but with a few fun thrills thrown in. (We wish not to be imitated, so regret we can not disclose all these features here at this time).</span><br/>
</li>
<li>Offer the world's first ""MOSS"" feature, or <i>Multi-user Optimized Security Settings</i>  Features to all our Users. If you wish to have your messages deleted upon being read, just select that Option and it will be done. If you wish to save and archive them, or delete them every 24 hours, just a few clicks will do that too, and much more... For the first time ever, <b>you</b> will be able to decide how you wish to manage your communications security. This feature is currently in advanced stages of development by us.</li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Offer EmotiDial in the world's Top 50 languages. Currently we only offer the Top 24 Languages.</span></li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The concept of knowing your contacts' /mood <b>before you dial</b> them is the brainchild of Ray Nasir, who now has a ""Patent-pending"" on this concept and the processes involved. Work on making this concept a reality began in late 2013 and we have gotten thus far making EmotiDial a reality today. Our Team has a life-long passion to help people through technology and whilst EmotiDial is by no means our first such initiative, it is certainly the one we feel that is the most promising  and truly has the potential to some day be even bigger than Facebook, God-willing!<br/></p>

<p></p>
</div><div> <p>We estimate that we need about US$150,000 to help us move to the next immediate phase, from where we can then have a sufficiently large user base to generate enough revenues to keep the service live and current. Revenue sources will primarily be Premium subscriptions as well as the non-intrusive banner ads.</p>
<p>EmotiDial is a Freemium App, and we expect over 90% of our Users to be using the Service for Free for life. The remaining 10% will be Premium customers who are willing to pay a small annual fee for extra features that we will offer them. Being realistic, we have incorporated the banner ads from day one, as this helps us to cover some of the costs incurred in offering this service for free.</p>
<p>We are confident of reaching, if not exceeding our goal of raising US$150,000 for this Project. If we exceed this, we can grow faster and make this powerful App available to more people sooner everywhere. If we fail to meet the full goal that we have set, then we will still do the best we can to achieve as many of the tasks we have set ourselves, as possible within whatever amount we do raise. In all cases, we promise we will keep you posted via email, if you so desire.</p>

</div></div>","Summary






EmotiDial is an extremely compelling and powerful App that empowers any smart phone user to explore what mood his/her friends are in before they dial them.
How often do you dial someone, only to realize it's was not a good time to call. With EmotiDial, you no longer have to be worried about this. Before you dial someone, just check what mood that person is in. Similarly, when you receive a call, the caller's mood will also be indicated, so you decide if you really wish to take that call.
If you are in a mood for a movie, just check who else is in the same mood as you, then dial from within the App, using our innovative Dialer Dashboard. You can update your mood as often as you like  and also design and upload your own moods for private use  - or publish them online for all to use. 
You can also upload all your Contacts on our Cloud and restore them to any phone at any time you wish. Upgrading your phone, or moving across platforms (e.g. from iOS to Android or vice versa)? No worries, just download the EmotiDial App on your new phone and simply LogIn and click on Restore and you are done! No more wasting hours on trying to copy your Address Book to a new phone/OS. EmotiDial makes managing your Contacts a breeze - and does it much more securely too.
Best of all: Not only is this all FREE, its also loads of FUN too! 


Almost 100 default moods to choose from, and counting....




Feel Empowered
Incoming calls from fellow EmotiDial Contacts will indicate both their current mood and  location. Now you decide if you really want to take that call.


One-Touch Dialing, Chat or Messaging Click on any Contact in your Address Book and choose how you wish to communicate with them  - a simple voice call, SMS, chat, Viber, Whatsapp, Skype etc. No need to open different Apps separately.  


Design your own Dial-pad Choose your style of keys, the color theme, font size and even the type of font you wish to use for the keys on your customized Dial-pad.





Never worry about your Contacts/Address Book ever againWe all change our phones once in a while and the biggest challenge is to transfer or copy our Contacts/Address Book to the new phone. With EmotiDial this is no longer an issue as you can create, backup and restore all your Contacts on and from the Cloud. The EmotiDial cloud also supports restoring Contacts across different Operating Systems; so for instance, if you wish to migrate from iOS to Android, simply backup your Contacts using your iOS Phone, and restore all the Contacts to your new Android.  For added security, you can also backup all Contact data from the Cloud to your own SD Card if you so desire.



Mutilingual
Available today in 24 languages, and we are working hard to add more...


Our Indiegogo Campaign is designed to help make EmotiDial available to everyone globally who has a Smart Phone; and the Funds we raise will help us to specifically achieve the following goals:


More quickly migrate from Testing Phase (Beta)  to a fully functional app - that will be available for download globally.
Broaden our prospective user-base by adding iOS, Windows and other versions of EmotiDial. Currently we can only support Android, (which is circa 85% of all Smart phone owners).  With your help, we wish to make this available to every smart phone owner in every country in the world.

Enable FREE VOIP Calls and Messaging - just like Viber and Whatsapp but with a few fun thrills thrown in. (We wish not to be imitated, so regret we can not disclose all these features here at this time).

Offer the world's first ""MOSS"" feature, or Multi-user Optimized Security Settings  Features to all our Users. If you wish to have your messages deleted upon being read, just select that Option and it will be done. If you wish to save and archive them, or delete them every 24 hours, just a few clicks will do that too, and much more... For the first time ever, you will be able to decide how you wish to manage your communications security. This feature is currently in advanced stages of development by us.
Offer EmotiDial in the world's Top 50 languages. Currently we only offer the Top 24 Languages.



The concept of knowing your contacts' /mood before you dial them is the brainchild of Ray Nasir, who now has a ""Patent-pending"" on this concept and the processes involved. Work on making this concept a reality began in late 2013 and we have gotten thus far making EmotiDial a reality today. Our Team has a life-long passion to help people through technology and whilst EmotiDial is by no means our first such initiative, it is certainly the one we feel that is the most promising  and truly has the potential to some day be even bigger than Facebook, God-willing!

What We Need & What You Get

 We estimate that we need about US$150,000 to help us move to the next immediate phase, from where we can then have a sufficiently large user base to generate enough revenues to keep the service live and current. Revenue sources will primarily be Premium subscriptions as well as the non-intrusive banner ads.
EmotiDial is a Freemium App, and we expect over 90% of our Users to be using the Service for Free for life. The remaining 10% will be Premium customers who are willing to pay a small annual fee for extra features that we will offer them. Being realistic, we have incorporated the banner ads from day one, as this helps us to cover some of the costs incurred in offering this service for free.
We are confident of reaching, if not exceeding our goal of raising US$150,000 for this Project. If we exceed this, we can grow faster and make this powerful App available to more people sooner everywhere. If we fail to meet the full goal that we have set, then we will still do the best we can to achieve as many of the tasks we have set ourselves, as possible within whatever amount we do raise. In all cases, we promise we will keep you posted via email, if you so desire.

                                                       
Every contribution made matters, and we are grateful for this. As
a humble thank you, your name will be permanently listed on our
website for life;  even once we grow bigger
than Facebook :)  To be part of something that we hope and believe will someday be on billions of Smart phones globally is not an opportunity to be missed. Ambitious as this may sound, the math behind this ambition is really quite simple: 



Facebook is about 1 Billion Users and counting;


Total number of cell/mobile phones globally: 6+ Billion; of which Smart phones are almost 2 Billion and counting (growing faster than Facebook's growth rate)


Not everybody is on social media, but everybody who has a phone, does dial! With this free App, there is no reason why they would not EmotiDial instead! 




For every contribution made, we have tried to be as fair as we can at this time, and offer various tiers of Premium Membership as generously as we can. 



$10  contribution -  One Years FREE Premium Membership

$25  contribution -  Two Years FREE Premium Membership
$50 contribution -  Five Years FREE Premium Membership
$250 contribution -  Life Time FREE Premium Membership

$1,000 contribution -  Life Time FREE Premium Membership for you and 5 family/friends




                                                         

Restricted to the first visionary Contributor only, who contributes US$150,000+, we are happy to award him/her a Co-Founder status, with virtually all privileges that come with this. Your contribution will make this all possible much sooner - so it is only fair that you earn this special recognition, because you made it happen! Since we are a bit media shy, we would be delighted for you to take some (or possibly all) of the media attention if you so desire.

<p><strong>Who We Are</strong></p>
<p>We are a team of devoted developers, called DevLis Innovation, who love to create new things from amazing ideas.<br/>We think that there is something missing in the gaming industry, something that needs to break the limitations that we encounter in most game systems available nowadays. We want to create a new concept of interaction between the gamer and the game itself!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>We decided to have this project posted on IndieGoGo.com so we could have a starting point for the development of a production model, but more important, we need to prove that this idea can work and it will help every ""game lover"" all around the world to benefit even more from their gaming systems.</p>
<p>Just like it was shown in the presentation video, if this idea comes to life, every person will be capable of ""pluging in"" a powerful controller, the ouPad gamepad, and take the game experience to a whole new level.</p>
<p>We are not only looking for funds, we are also looking for supporters that can help us making this possible. Ideas and ""mind support"" are welcome and very important to us.</p>
<p>If by some reason we are unable to reach our desired goal, the funds that were acquired by us will be returned to their respective owners.</p>
<p>We will not give up if this happens, but unfortunately we'll not have all the means necessary.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>With the ouPad, any developer or enthusiast will be able to program and create something new for this device, since it will be completely open source! With this amazing capability, new contents will emerge into the game industry, giving anyone a chance to show their idea to the world.</p>

So we decided to create the Beacoin. This coin sized bluetooth device will act as a beacon for both iOS (iBeacon) and Android. We have decided to open source the SDK for iOS and Android and will be made available on out github page once the funding goal has been achieved. The device will run off a 3V button battery that is designed to last for up to a year.</p><ul>

<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">My name is Basil and I am the technical Co-Founder of TECSOL. We started our company in 2009 and are into development of software services related to iOS, Android and Web Applications. We are also into the business of electrical consulting and deal with electrical simulations at the grid level.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>The current solutions for iBeacon only support iOS and are expensive. iOS implementation only speaks of beacon development between two iOS devices. We are currently developing the SDK to support Android as well. Also there is no need to have an iOS device to act as a transmit beacon. Beacoin will help you setup beacons and you can use our SDK for any custom development that you are looking to deploy. Most beacons available in the market cost 5 times as much. We are looking to pull the cost of the device down.</li>

It works well on iOS7 and Android devices that support BLE. We have tested it on the iPhone 5, Samsung Galaxy S4 and the iPad Air </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">and are looking to mass produce this device. Our designs are fully verified by TI and we are working closely with the TI engineers to make this happen. We are already a part of the TI development community.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Our device will also support firmware upgrades in case the beacon bluetooth profile changes at any time. This will be done with a micro usb connection and software that will be made available once we have reached our goal.</span><br/>

</ul></div>","BeacoinOf late the new bluetooth 4.0 specification has been getting a lot of  hype due to its extremely low voltage specifications and  bluetooth beacon implementation. So we decided to create the Beacoin. This coin sized bluetooth device will act as a beacon for both iOS (iBeacon) and Android. We have decided to open source the SDK for iOS and Android and will be made available on out github page once the funding goal has been achieved. The device will run off a 3V button battery that is designed to last for up to a year.

My name is Basil and I am the technical Co-Founder of TECSOL. We started our company in 2009 and are into development of software services related to iOS, Android and Web Applications. We are also into the business of electrical consulting and deal with electrical simulations at the grid level.

The current solutions for iBeacon only support iOS and are expensive. iOS implementation only speaks of beacon development between two iOS devices. We are currently developing the SDK to support Android as well. Also there is no need to have an iOS device to act as a transmit beacon. Beacoin will help you setup beacons and you can use our SDK for any custom development that you are looking to deploy. Most beacons available in the market cost 5 times as much. We are looking to pull the cost of the device down.

We already have the prototype design that runs on the TI2541 BLE chip on the CC2541DK-MINI - CC2541 Mini Development Kit. It works well on iOS7 and Android devices that support BLE. We have tested it on the iPhone 5, Samsung Galaxy S4 and the iPad Air and are looking to mass produce this device. Our designs are fully verified by TI and we are working closely with the TI engineers to make this happen. We are already a part of the TI development community.


Our device will also support firmware upgrades in case the beacon bluetooth profile changes at any time. This will be done with a micro usb connection and software that will be made available once we have reached our goal.

Product Design ConceptProduct Use CaseThe concept was best explained by Apple during during their developer conference. Here they have used of another iOS device to act as a beacon. Our product eliminates the need of this.This video only speaks of beacon implementation on iOS. We will be releasing an open source SDK for Android on our github page once we reach the funding goal.CNET iBeacon VideoiBeacon in the news

<p>iSafer presents a simple, compact and integrated solution to users.

<p>Tests were performed in an indoor environment, at a room temperature of 29°C. After running for 2 hours, the laptop temperature went up to around 42°C. With iSafer padding, users would only feel temperatures of around 34-36 °C, which is almost the same as human body temperature. </p>
<p>Did you know that by running your laptop for 1 hour, you are actually producing 0.0189kg of carbon?  Even more if you are using an external USB cooling fan. The iSafer sleeve bag is an easy way to lower laptop temperature without the need for electricity.

... For the benefits of some who doesn't really understand a  3D Printer ..




I have found a short animated film for you. This animated film is created by ""funk-e Studios"": 



... Why such an affordable 3D Printer? :)3D printers can bring about changes, such as crafting ideas into tangibles, schools use them to evoke creativity in students, personalizing gifts, printing houses, and much more. But generally speaking, only those with cash to spare can afford to pay an exorbitant price for the 3D printers.     Therefore, we are here to...

     

share what the world brings to us, to everyone.
do our little part to ""affortify creativities"".

TWO goals to achieve in this Short Term: To bring you affordable PrinterM3 in hope to invoke creativity and fun in our stressful lives; To make profit to start a neuron-related business for ourselves.

...Ah! And the love story I am supposed to tell.Maybe bring forth some love, to your classmates in need... Perhaps some simple can't afford it.

Where will the monies go to and what was done thus far?


			 

			For all the 3D Printernias, we knows the cost down to the screws used, and we have to thank the Internet for this. By looking at the price-tags we have put on, I believe you know our profit margins are really minimal. 

For all the kind souls out there, please kindly spread the words on our behalf!

			We have chosen the All-or-Nothing scheme, as we would like to see a project from the beginning to end. Also, we have done up contract with the manufacturer, so that the pledges would not be disappointed of not receiving their rewards (except for Acts of gods etc).

This allows rating a particular user. Collecting a number of negative ratings bans a user from chat temporarily. A banned user will need to solve an anti-spam token to be able to use chat again. If the same user will collect another particular number of negative ratings it will block the user permanently from using our service. On the other hand, collecting positive ratings eliminates negatives and lets the user to chat without any restrictions.<br/>Another thing that makes gaday.net different form other chat services is stating your own sex is compulsory. You don’t need to choose the other chat user sex, but before you can enter a chat room you need to state yours. If you want to chat with man / woman only you may select one and you will be assigned to the other user with chosen by you sex. <br/>One more difference is choosing the language you want to talk in. It is quite common that on Omegle you are connected with the person talking in another language that you don’t know. In <a href=""http://gaday.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">gaday.net</a> you choose the language you want to talk in and only users who talk this language will be connected with you. It doesn’t matter if you speak English, German, Polish or Spanish .We will find someone speaking in the language you can easily communicate in.<strong id=""internal-source-marker_0.14603353757411242""><br/><br/><span>What is the money needed for?</span><br/></strong>We are looking for funds to prepare a mobile app for all popular mobile operating systems(iOS, Android, Symbian and Windows Mobile).Preparing a native application for those systems will cost around 10k $<br/>Gaday.net has been born form an idea for mobile application. We think it is the ideal idea for mobile users. It doesn’t matter where you are ( a bus, boring meeting at work, or relaxing at your favorite armchair after work) ,you can meet and chat to someone interesting. As a mobile application we can also use such mobile features as GPS, compass and camera. With users’ permissions, we want a mobile application to find other chat users close to them using a GPS or let them choose areas from a map where to look for chat users they want to talk to.  <br/>We think about two types of application: Basic and Premium. Premium application will not contain any adverts. We need adverts in the basic version of application to maintain high standards of servers and application performance.<br/>The web version of gaday.net is working now. The project has been made by a team of three people. We spent a lot of our time and our own money, but funding the developing of mobile application is out of our reach but we really want it to be as good as our idea.<strong id=""internal-source-marker_0.14603353757411242""><br/><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Why we did not add promotion video?</strong></p>
<p>We could make a nice and interesting video for this project<br/>but we decided not to wast the time for something that doesn't make the idea any better.<br/>Instead in our opinion it's better to gain funds as soon as possible<br/>and start working on mobile application so everyone can enjoy the chatting anywhere you are.</p>

If you want to chat with man / woman only you may select one and you will be assigned to the other user with chosen by you sex. One more difference is choosing the language you want to talk in. It is quite common that on Omegle you are connected with the person talking in another language that you don’t know. In gaday.net you choose the language you want to talk in and only users who talk this language will be connected with you. It doesn’t matter if you speak English, German, Polish or Spanish .We will find someone speaking in the language you can easily communicate in.What is the money needed for?We are looking for funds to prepare a mobile app for all popular mobile operating systems(iOS, Android, Symbian and Windows Mobile).Preparing a native application for those systems will cost around 10k $Gaday.net has been born form an idea for mobile application. We think it is the ideal idea for mobile users. It doesn’t matter where you are ( a bus, boring meeting at work, or relaxing at your favorite armchair after work) ,you can meet and chat to someone interesting. As a mobile application we can also use such mobile features as GPS, compass and camera. With users’ permissions, we want a mobile application to find other chat users close to them using a GPS or let them choose areas from a map where to look for chat users they want to talk to.  We think about two types of application: Basic and Premium. Premium application will not contain any adverts. We need adverts in the basic version of application to maintain high standards of servers and application performance.The web version of gaday.net is working now. The project has been made by a team of three people. We spent a lot of our time and our own money, but funding the developing of mobile application is out of our reach but we really want it to be as good as our idea.
Why we did not add promotion video?
We could make a nice and interesting video for this projectbut we decided not to wast the time for something that doesn't make the idea any better.Instead in our opinion it's better to gain funds as soon as possibleand start working on mobile application so everyone can enjoy the chatting anywhere you are.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Scaleno is an iPhone docking station made entirely out of wood using a unique technology. Scaleno is shaped to passively amplify the audio coming out of the integrated speaker and to redirect it towards you. Scaleno is also designed to allow the original charging cable to be connected while listening to your favorite music. On top of that, Scaleno will also act as a perfect hands-free speaker for your calls, keeping your ears away from potentially harmful waves!</p>
<p>We created Scaleno working alongside Giulia, a young and talented Italian designer, and a small artisan company with a huge know-how thanks to hundreds of years of experience in woodcarving.</p>

<p>Ciao,</p>
<p>Il mio nome è Giacomo, sono il fondatore di designerwannabe.com e sono qui per presentarvi il nostro nuovo progetto, Scaleno.</p>
<p>La nostra azienda ha sviluppato una piattaforma che mette in contatto aziende manifatturiere medio-piccole con giovani designer di talento. Negli scorsi 8 mesi abbiamo ricevuto numerose proposte interessanti dai membri della nostra community, ma ci siamo innamorati di una, Scaleno. La designer che lo ha creato si chiama Giulia e vogliamo trasformare questo progetto in realtà.</p>
<p><img alt=""Drawing"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.scaleno.it/indiegogo/disegno.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: baseline;"" title=""Drawing""/></p>
<p>Scaleno è una docking station per iPhone costruita interamente in legno a partire da un unico pezzo con una tecnologia unica. La particolare forma di Scaleno amplifica passivamente il suono proveniente dall’altoparlante del telefono e lo ridirige verso l’ascoltatore. Scaleno è inoltre progettato per ospitare il cavo di ricarica originale Apple, tenendo il telefono in carica durante l’ascolto delle tue canzoni preferite. Inoltre, Scaleno è un perfetto accessorio per telefonare in viva-voce con le mani libere e un suono chiaro.</p>
<p>Abbiamo creato Scaleno grazie all’aiuto di Giulia, una giovane designer di talento, ed una piccola realtà artigiana con un enorme know-how dovuto a generazioni di esperienza nella lavorazione del legno.</p>
<p>La nostra missione è di proporre prodotti <em>Made in Italy</em> investendo in giovani designer e cercando di scoprire piccole eccellenze artigiane. Design e artigianato, fattori per cui il nostro paese è famoso nel mondo!</p>

<p><em>Giacomo</em>: Dopo aver condotto una brillante carriera nel settore della comunicazione, Giacomo ha deciso di iniziare la sua avventura imprenditoriale poco meno di un anno fa. Oggi collabora con diverse aziende assistendole nella fase di creazione di nuove idee ed aiutandole ad innovare il loro portfolio.</p>
<p><em>Alessandra</em>: Dopo aver lavorato per alcuni anni come interior designer e come architetto (e dopo aver dato alla luce due bellissimi bimbi), Alessandra si è unita a Giacomo nella sua avventura. Oggi lo assiste nella gestione delle relazioni con i designer e con i clienti.</p>
<p><em>Giulia</em>: La più giovane del team, ha già vinto dei concorsi nel campo del design industriale.</p>
<p><strong>Cosa faremo con la somma raccolta?</strong></p>
<p>Ora, per fare la differenza, abbiamo bisogno del vostro aiuto. Con i vostri contributi saremo in grado di:</p>
<p>-       Produrre il primo lotto di Scaleno</p>
<p>-       Produrre il packaging che Scaleno merita</p>
<p>-       Realizzare un e-shop e promuovere scaleno presso negozi del settore</p>
<p><strong>Quali ricompense?</strong></p>
<p>Anche 1$ ci è utile, quindi non ci sono scuse J Con un’offerta di almeno 1$ il vostro nome sarà pubblicato nella pagina dei ringraziamenti sul nostro sito <a href=""http://www.scaleno.it/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.scaleno.it</a>. Ovviamente saremo ben felici di accettare donazioni più importanti, ed ecco cosa vi aspetta in questo caso:</p>
<p>Se doni 10$ ti invieremo una versione cartacea di Scaleno, personalizzata con il tuo nome, da tagliare, piegare ed incollare. Potrai tagliarne e costruirne quanti vorrai per ricordarti sempre di noi.</p>

Quali ricompense?
Anche 1$ ci è utile, quindi non ci sono scuse J Con un’offerta di almeno 1$ il vostro nome sarà pubblicato nella pagina dei ringraziamenti sul nostro sito www.scaleno.it. Ovviamente saremo ben felici di accettare donazioni più importanti, ed ecco cosa vi aspetta in questo caso:
Se doni 10$ ti invieremo una versione cartacea di Scaleno, personalizzata con il tuo nome, da tagliare, piegare ed incollare. Potrai tagliarne e costruirne quanti vorrai per ricordarti sempre di noi.

Se contribuisci con 59$, per uno dei primi 50pezzi o 69$ successivamente, riceverai uno Scaleno del nostro primo lotto. Potrai scegliere tra le seguenti essenze di legno:
 
Acero

Mogano

Faggio

Rovere

Ciliegio

Frassino

Noce

Per 64$ se sei veloce, o per $79 se non lo sei, potrai avere uno Scaleno personalizzato con due linee di testo incise (massimo 30 caratteri per linea).

Se doni 69$ puoi ricevere un pezzo della nostra Limited Edition di Scaleno. L’edizione limitata sarà realizzata in cirmolo non trattato, un legno tipico delle nostre montagne. Ogni esemplare sarà numerato e firmato da Giulia, la nostra designer. Con il legno di cirmolo verrà realizzata solo questa seria limitata e non verrà più utilizzato per produrre altri pezzi cosicché il tuo pezzo sia davvero unico.

Per contributi ancora maggiori, potrai ricevere maggiori quantità di Scaleno e saremo felici di fornire grandi quantità con i pacchetti per negozi.
Tabella di conversione dollari-Euro $/€:
Per noi europei, abituati ad utilizzare gli Euro, una tabella che ti aiuterà a capire quanto valgono le diverse donazioni:
1$ = 0,80€ (ti costerebbe di più offrirci un caffè!!)
10$ = 8€
59$ = 45,50€
64$ = 49,30€
69$ = 53,10€
79$ = 60,80€
135$ = 103,90€
149$ = 114,70€
399$ = 307€ (30,70€ a pezzo)
759$ = 584€ (29,20€ a pezzo)
E se non riesco a donare?

<p>The Bark Arcade is an online platform for HTML5 games played directly in your browser. The admission gives you access to the complete game collection. A special controlling system allows you to play the games on a big screen, using your smartphone or tablet device as a controller. Ultimately, the Web Arcade presents not only a low priced alternative to conventional online game stores, but also to regular game consoles. </p>
<p><strong>PLAY AWESOME HTML5 GAMES ON YOUR BIG SCREEN</strong><br/><strong> USE YOUR TABLET, SMARTPHONE OR COMPUTER AS A CONTROLLER</strong><br/><strong> PLAY HOT MULTIPLAYER MATCHES</strong></p>
<p>The platform gives you immediate access to all featured games, without needing to download them separately. There will also be an App provided, which enables you to play on a big screen, using your smartphone or tablet device as a controller. This makes playing HTML5 games into a whole new experience.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/536786/pictures/full/20121113154830-main.jpg?1352850514"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h2>KEY FEATURES</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>HTML5 games platform</strong></li>
<li><strong>Social payment support for game developers</strong></li>
<li><strong>Mobile devices as controller</strong></li>
<li><strong>Customizable game controller</strong></li>
<li><strong>Hotseat multiplayer matches in the Browser</strong></li>
<li><strong>Everything is in the browser: Desktop, Notebooks and Tablets can be used for the game or as controller either</strong></li>
</ul><p> </p>
<h3>HTML5</h3>
<p>HTML5 is an upcoming technology, also for game development. With more and more developers, the community is growing constantly. However, HTML5 games are still kind of rare. So after developing a HTML5 game for iOS, I couldn’t help but wonder: why aren’t more developers using this convenient technology?</p>
<p>What is missing, is an online platform with a correspondant payment model, where indie games can be released for free and still make money.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>CONTROLLER</h3>
<p>Your smartphone is your controller and thus has many more capabilities that can be used to enchance your gaming experience. Each game can provide it's own controller layout or use one of the standard controller provided by the platform. It can interact with the controller, changing whats displayed or even how things work while the game is running. All this is done in simple HTML and Javascript.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>TIME BASED SOCIAL PAYMENT MODEL</h3>
<p>The admission is based on a monthly payment of $2, but can be increased voluntarily. It allows access to the complete game collection in the library.</p>
<p>The games played by a user are being tracked, so that these games can take share in the sales according to the play time. 60% of the total income will be distributed among the game developers, 40% will be used for server costs, platform-development and -service.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>SUPPORTED GAMES ON RELEASE</h3>
<p>Game developers will not only take share in the earnings, but will also be promoted on the platform. Therefore, we are confident of finding studios which will provide their games. At least, we will support a few nice HTML5 open source games, like <a href=""http://operasoftware.github.com/Emberwind/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Emberwind HTML5</a>, and our own games, like <a href=""http://www.steamclash.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Steamclash</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>WHAT WE NEED YOU FOR</h3>
<p>With your help, we could employ two developers (Malte and Philip) to get the Bark Arcade started. After a first alpha version with correspondent API, the next steps would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setting up server structures</li>
<li>Development of the Bark Network</li>
<li>Further development of the API</li>
<li>Further development of Controller Apps for Android and iOS</li>
<li>Optional Desktop Apps</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<h3>PERKS</h3>
<p><strong>Free access </strong></p>
<p>All donations above $2 gives you free access to Bark Arcade for a period of time. In comparison, the regular minimum monthly admission to the platform is $2.</p>
<p><strong>Premium contributor status</strong></p>
<p>On top of that, you will permanently have the premium contributor status, which gives you an extra contributor badge in highscores and ladders, yearly exclusive premium ingame material and features, like extra characters and levels. It will also show other players that you supported the project from the beginning in your profile.</p>
<p><strong>Closed beta</strong></p>
<p>And of course, you will get the closed beta version of the Bark Arcade as soon as it’s out. This won’t only help us to refine the product, but it will also give you the opportunity to check out the whole thing.</p>
<p><strong>Signed T-shirt</strong></p>
<p>All donations of $64 and more will be given a Bark Arcade T-shirt, signed exclusively by Malte!</p>
<p><strong>You telling the game advice</strong></p>
<p>The $256 “You telling the game advice” perk offers a personal thank you from us by mentioning your name in the loading screens. Your picture and name will randomly be shown next to the game advice speech balloon for the Bark Arcade games.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>IF WE GET MORE</h3>
<p>In case we raise more than our goal of $16.000, we contemplate on what we could further develop - purely hypothetical.</p>
<p>Above $30.000: We will produce a free to play game for Bark Arcade.</p>
<p>Above $40.000: We will support Windows Phone 8</p>
<p>Above $50.000: We will support offline games.</p>
<p>Above $150.000: We will develop a set-top box for Bark Arcade!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>RISKS</h3>
<p>Since this is a fixed funding, there will be no risk for you in making a donation. In the case of not reaching our goal, you will get your money back.</p>
<p>If we achieve our goal, you will naturally get your perks. However, we are not sure how long it will take to launch the beta version, but we are confident that it will take no longer than six months after the successful funding.</p>
<p>In order to use Bark Arcade, you need a WiFi connection. Modern home WiFis are stable and fast enough.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>TIMELINE</h3>
<ul>
<li>January 2013 – crowdfunding finished</li>
<li>January 2013 – Beginning of work: development of Beta version, servers ect.</li>
<li>July 2012 - Closed Beta</li>
<li>October 2012 - Release and start of the contributor memberships</li>
</ul><p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3>FOR GAME DEVELOPERS</h3>
<p>We are always on the lookout for new contacts and ideas. If you are a developer and interested in the project, we would love to hear from you so why don’t you <a href=""mailto:developer@barkarcade.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">give us a shout</a>!</p>
<p>In addition to the input and network API, we also plan to provide cool game APIs for highscores, ladders, achievements and eventually even online games. Yay!</p>
<p>Please take note that we will need the money raised by this campaign for developing and for server structures. That is to say that any income can only be distributed to game developers after new memberships have been created.</p>
<p>However, the advantage of publishing a game in an early stage is that your game will be promoted and established on the platform from the start on.</p>

</ul></div>","The Radgile Vic 2020 is a better way to work and play.  Instead of being forced to sit hunched over a desk in order to enjoy a large monitor up close, the innovative console enables computer users, gamers and people who conduct business from home to enjoy a versatile workstation – complete with their large screen monitor and/or video projector, computing device or game console, keyboard, mouse and power supply – to be used with their optimal seating choice.  The Vic 2020 can be viewed as a perfect complement to your existing work setup, or, as a complete desk replacement.  For many, using the Vic 2020 as a standing station along side their current setup will provide a new option.  For many others, using the Vic 2020 with an existing sofa, recliner, or chaise will be the perfect alternative to using a laptop on their lap.In addition, the Vic 2020 can be fitted with accessories such as a planned device charging station and additional shelves and bins for endless versatility.  Lastly, the shelving system houses a cord management system that is integrated with a power supply chamber in the base, completely concealing all cords except the one going to the power source.That is not an endorsement, but we think Jony's quote succinctly captures the essence of good design.  Which is why we've designed the Vic 2020 with those same ideas and principles in mind. As a result, the Vic 2020 is as stylish as it is functional.  With a footprint measured in inches rather than feet, the Vic 2020 can fit anywhere, and it can even serve as a desk replacement.  Due to its modular design, the Vic 2020 is endlessly versatile.  With its integrated cord management system and adjustable shelving system, the Vic 2020 can serve many purposes and elegantly handle many scenarios.The Vic 2020 has no mechanical mechanisms and almost no moving parts.  The only parts that move are the castors.  Everything else is designed for strength and enduring beauty.Sit high or sit low.  The adjustable shelving system can accommodate casual seating positioned close to the ground as easily as it can be used at typical seating heights.Or stand.  For many, the Vic 2020 is fine for a standing scenario right out of the box.  For others, we are actively developing a standing adapter that will allow you to effortlessy extend the vertical range of the shelving system and position a keyboard and mousing surface as high as 45"" from the ground.You can also add additional shelves and storage options, such as drawers and bins.  Other accessories, such as a device charging station, will add additional utility to the Vic 2020 for many people.  For others, the included shelves will meet their needs for years to come, which of course, is also great!Do you have 10 minutes?  The Vic 2020 will come in three main pieces, plus the shelves.  Connect the three main pieces (just 4 bolts required - tool included), add the shelves, castors and ballast, and you're done.  You can probably even sip your coffee a few times during assembling and still come in under 10 minutes.One look at the console reveals how all of the components lock together to form a single component that directs all forces directly to the base - the same way that houses and other buildings are designed to rest on their footings.  With no mechanical parts, the result is a solid build that looks sleek and is designed to last.The material used to build the Vic 2020 will be selected as part of 
finalizing the design for manufacturing and final testing.  We will 
select a high quality resin that provides a stylish appearance and the 
structural integrity that the Vic 2020 requires.Well, make that no maintenance.  Once assembled, just use and enjoy the Vic 2020.Today, you may use your laptop plugged into a docking station at the Vic 2020.  Tomorrow, you may place a tablet on a shelf and after a brief automatic sync, you will have instant access to the available mouse, keyboard, display and power source.  Either way, you have convenient infrastructure services at the ready, and your favorite choice of seating to allow you to enjoy it all.  With the Vic 2020, you're ready for today and tomorrow.ShapesBecause of the high cost of tooling, depending on how we do during this campaign, we will likely initially only be able to produce one embodiment of the Vic 2020.  Contributors at the designated levels will get to have a vote on which shape they like best.  Due to many other factors that need to be considered, we cannot guarantee that the vote will control.  However, you can be certain that the result of that vote will be a major factor in our decision about which embodiment to build first.ColorsClassic Black and Stone Grey, with matching color shelves, will be the initial colors available.More Options & AccessoriesWe have exciting plans for the Vic 2020.  More colors, translucent shelves, a standing adapter that increases the functional range of the shelving system, a charging station for neatly charging all of your devices, drawers and bins for organizing your stuff - these things are all validated concepts which we look forward to delivering as soon as possible!Summary

Not only is the current/power data needed but also when and how long the load is on. <br/><br/>A smart phone or tablet, which is Bluetooth enabled, is the choice of most homeowners for reviewing such information. Both peak and average power of an air conditioner, for example, can be measured over days or weeks. The current on standby (off current) and full operation of an appliance, such as a computer or TV, can be recorded, as well as when it is on (something a parent may want to know).<br/>In addition to local readings, the meter has network capabilities, ready for the smart grid and Internet of  Things. And also, being non-contact, is completely safe. <br/><br/>In addition to local readings, the meter has network capabilities, ready for the smart grid and Internet of Things. <br/></p></span></span></span></span><h3>Our Non-contact Meter</h3>
<span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><p>The thin, credit-card sized power meter simply slips over a standard electrical plug as it is plugged into the receptacle. No electrical contact is made with the plug prongs because of a unique current and voltage sensors involving inductive and capacitive pickup. Power calculations, timing and logging are done by an internal microcomputer. Data is taken every 10 seconds and transmitted via Bluetooth upon request. It may be programmed to send alerts if operation is detected outside of preset conditions (e.g. on too long or at wrong time of day). Because of the internal battery the meter retains logged data and will respond wirelessly even if unplugged. <br/>    </p>

Point-of-load electrical AC power meters are able to provide detailed information on power usage but data must be recorded over days or weeks and displayed in an easily understood format to be useful. Not only is the current/power data needed but also when and how long the load is on. A smart phone or tablet, which is Bluetooth enabled, is the choice of most homeowners for reviewing such information. Both peak and average power of an air conditioner, for example, can be measured over days or weeks. The current on standby (off current) and full operation of an appliance, such as a computer or TV, can be recorded, as well as when it is on (something a parent may want to know).In addition to local readings, the meter has network capabilities, ready for the smart grid and Internet of  Things. And also, being non-contact, is completely safe. In addition to local readings, the meter has network capabilities, ready for the smart grid and Internet of Things. Our Non-contact Meter
The thin, credit-card sized power meter simply slips over a standard electrical plug as it is plugged into the receptacle. No electrical contact is made with the plug prongs because of a unique current and voltage sensors involving inductive and capacitive pickup. Power calculations, timing and logging are done by an internal microcomputer. Data is taken every 10 seconds and transmitted via Bluetooth upon request. It may be programmed to send alerts if operation is detected outside of preset conditions (e.g. on too long or at wrong time of day). Because of the internal battery the meter retains logged data and will respond wirelessly even if unplugged.     
          
 
 
Smartphone Display
Data from the meter is transmitted wireless via Bluetooth to a nearby smart phone or tablet. The meter may be programmed to send updates if there is a change of load (e.g. TV on). The meter continues to log data (weeks) even when the wireless connection is unavailable and updates when it becomes available. User graphs indicate when the load changes (on or off) occur. Also analysis of energy usage over time is provided.
     
         
 

Why Load Monitoring?

This wireless meter is convenient for the following applications:Appliance energy usage  ---     Data is averaged over days or weeks
Screen time tracking   ---    Logs when and how long TV, video games or PC is on
Identify vampire loads  --    Standby current or phantom loads
Smart grid ready   ----         Suitable for smart buildings and IoT applications

Saving Energy by Monitoring

Studies by utilities have shown that 5% to 20% of electrical energy is wasted in residential and commercial spaces. Some diligence is needed by homeowners and office managers to avoid this waste but they need to know where the waste is occurring. For the average homeowner annual saving of $200 can be realized. A simple one-time reading can be of some help but what is really needed is long-term monitoring over days or weeks to understand where energy is being wasted. This is why logging is an easily graphical readout or dashboard is needed. Features

The Development Process
We are well along in the development process and have a prototype of the non-contact power meter, although not in the thin form which slips over a plug. The prototype was presented at a technical conference and a discussion of our concepts and the background of the project are given in a white paper: We are experienced in developing and manufacturing wireless sensors but have not married the non-contact prototype with Bluetooth – this is the project for which we are requesting funding. 
             Our prototype
Smart Grid and IoT
A major goal of the smart grid is to achieve control and monitoring of the grid from the generators down to the individual load level with data communicated in real time via the Internet. Our wireless meter has the necessary networking capability when the grid is ready for it. Our meter can also suitable as a sensor node for the Internet of Things, a grand concept where all sensors on the Internet, numbering in the billions, are interconnected. Business Model
After supplying the meters as perks we expect to continue production of the meters and sell through our website as we do our other networked sensor products. However we believe that a large market might be reached through resellers and distributors, and perhaps technology transfer. WiFi Option – stretch goal of $70k
Bluetooth LE has become a preferred choice for many wireless sensors but these can only be accessed by smart phones or tablets when they are within range. Where smart phones are not available WiFi is often a better option. As a stretch goal we will provide WiFi as an option. Two versions are being considered: (1) a small sensor board with a attached electronics and (2) a dual plug the size of the cover. The second plug allows two independent loads to be monitored.

<p>Modern smartphones are such great devices but, until now, making full use of their extraordinary features (hands-free via Bluetooth, GPS, location-based-reminders, etc.) would quickly render the phone useless from lack of power.<br/><br/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0065/1122/files/E-Fusion_on_dock_vertical_-_charging_grande.jpg?93"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0065/1122/files/E-Fusion_on_dock_horizontal_-_movie_grande.jpg?91"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0065/1122/files/Sharplines_E-Fusion_iPhone5_connection_interface_grande_grande.jpg?85"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0065/1122/files/Sharplines_E-Fusion_iPhone_4_and_5_with_docks_grande_grande.jpg?87"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>This is just the beginning of the journey!

<p>We want this to become the standard for smart-device magnetic charging dock. And so we will be offering 3D models and design guides as an Open Source project for the connector used on the device side. If you are a case manufacturer and want early access to those documents as well as the ones for the dock side, check out our HDK kit on the right.<br/>With inexpensive rapid prototyping services (such as Shapeways) we look forward to DYIers creating amazing designs to connect all their devices.<br/><br/></p>

<p>It took multiple rounds of prototypes to get to the sweet spot we are at now. Although the idea for such a magnetic charging case came to life many years ago, we were sure somebody was going to create one for us to use. After waiting and waiting we realized the great opportunity we had on our hands. So we got to work, about a year ago, and went through many design iterations, as you can see on the picture below. The case kept on getting better every time with more accessories to go along with it, like the low profile car mount and bike mount, as well as adding the 1/4-20 tripod mount and wall mount to our Universal Dock. We're now at the mature point where we're ready to start production tooling and just need you to help us get there.</p>

<p><strong>How does it affect battery life?</strong><br/>Your battery life improves! Don't listen to those stuck in the Ni-Cad batteries era (where full charge/discharge cycles where beneficial). The battery type used in most modern electronics (Lithium-ion) actually benefit from frequent recharge. For example, assuming you use 100% of your phone battery charge per day, recharging it twice a day vs. just at the end of the day will give your battery approximately 250 additional days of life.<br/>(<em>sources: <a href=""http://www.mpoweruk.com/life.htm#dod"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Electropaedia</a>, <a href=""http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/how_to_prolong_lithium_based_batteries"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Battery University</a></em>)</p>
<p><strong>Why not use induction wireless charging technology?</strong><br/>As cool as induction wireless charging technology is, it comes with some drawbacks. First, it takes longer to charge. Second, it doesn't provide USB connectivity to sync your device to your computer or car. Third and perhaps most importantly, the heat it generates can actually reduce battery life.<br/>(<em>source: <a href=""http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/charging_without_wires"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Battery University</a></em>)</p>
<p><strong>Don't the strong magnets affect the phone functions in any way?</strong><br/>This was our fear from the very beginning and we conducted a vast array of tests to confirm this project was feasible before starting any development on the cases. The result from all those tests boils down to our ""secret sauce"" which provide surprisingly strong magnet pull to keeps the phone securely held in place, while not letting any magnetic field bleed pass the case.</p>
<p><strong>When will a case be available for my XYZ phone?</strong><br/>Because we want as many phones as possible to be included we will be offering the technology (case side) as an Open Source project for any person or company to use free of charge. So you are likely to see a selection of cases available shortly after launch. The best way to ensure this happen is to make this project a success by either backing the project (get a set for your cousin's iPhone) or spread the word about E-Fusion to all your friends.<br/>UPDATE 6/27/13: We just added a post on our Facebook page where you can vote for your phone of choice: <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/Sharplines"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Vote!</a></p>

How about a wire-free lifestyle where simply touching your desk/car/office dock charges and connects your phone? This is what you'll get with E-Fusion:

Wireless connection! No dangling wires to clutter your car or your desk
True USB connection let you sync with iTunes or download your photos with no additional wires to plug in!
Keep your phone charged whether in your car, home, office...
Quickly rotate from portrait to landscape while maintaining electrical contact
Fully adjustable docks let you orient your phone just right
Dock and undock easily! Our heavy base doesn't follow your phone
Finally use the GPS without worrying about draining your battery!
Powerful magnets keep you phone in place while biking around town (6 Lbs of pull force to hold the 5 oz phone in place)
Replaces the original phone connector with our sturdier version
1/4-20 tripod mount under the Universal Dock makes it easy to keep the same setting for your podcast videos, etc.
Keep the same docks regardless of which brand of phone you go to next or which new connector the manufacturer decide to use (just get the appropriate case for your phone)
Home, office, car, bike, boat, wall, tripod, etc.
 
Modern smartphones are such great devices but, until now, making full use of their extraordinary features (hands-free via Bluetooth, GPS, location-based-reminders, etc.) would quickly render the phone useless from lack of power.
This is just the beginning of the journey! We want to make sure most phones are supported (either by doing the cases ourselves or supporting existing cases manufacturer to do so) so your whole family and friends can connect to the same dock. And with your help on this project we can make this dream a reality!
 
How do we stack up against the competition?
You may have heard of the Duracell Powermat or the Qi wireless charging standard being used on some of the latest phones (Google Nexus 4, Nokia Lumina, etc.). So how does the E-Fusion wireless charging system compares? The chart below is pretty self explanatory:

 
How it works
Wireless Conductive Charging is quite simple. It relies on physical contacts between spring pins on the dock side and matching traces on the back of the phone. In principle it works just like your old cordless phone did when you returned it to its base for charging. Ours differ in the ability to rotate the device while maintaining contact.We house this clever connector in the center of a magnetic ring in the dock so that when the phone is placed near it, it is attracted to the dock to form a solid bond.

<p><b>What is Bump 2 Know? </b>Bump 2 Know is a mobile app that handles multiple types of data to allow two people to verify each other and pass confidential STD data. We have developed apps in the past and we have experience in secure systems reducing the risks of completing the project to near zero. Dr. Bernstein has extensive knowledge in patient data and data handling assuring the proper handling of patient data.</p>

Mr. Perkins has been developing technologies in the areas of AI, Internet Marketing and Marketing Systems and Apps for the last two decades. Collectively, we have the skills to develop and market Bump 2 Know and to navigate the laws and relations necessary in the medical industry to make this happen.</p>
<p><b>Our Vision </b>We hope that our app becomes an integral part of organizations like planned parenthood and other support organizations to change the way couples engage each other and hopefully greatly increasing the awareness of STDs.</p>

Our<br/>manufacturer has been in business for 11 years making power banks and is a<br/>leading expert in the field or power bank technology.</p><p>Now, we are looking to you, our friends, for help raising the funds that we need<br/>to make this product a reality. $15,000 should do the trick. Every dollar counts<br/>toward this goal and we appreciate all the feedback and support we are getting.<br/>                                                                  <br/><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong><br/>We have come to you, Indiegogo, for help raising $15,000. These funds are<br/>going to cover the costs of manufacturing, marketing, and distributing the initial<br/>run of the Power Snap Band line. As a thank-you, we have put together some<br/>excellent deals as rewards for all our contributors, including huge discounts on power snap band itself.</p><p><strong>The Impact</strong><br/>This device is going to save people money and make charging your devices<br/>more convenient than ever before. We are confident in the unique utility of Power Snap Band and excited to bring it to market.</p><p><strong>Our Commitment</strong><br/>The last few months have been filled with hard work partnering with the best<br/>factories in China to bring the best new technology in to your life. We are ready to move forward with manufacturing our product. This will be ship out by end of Feb/Mar 2018 time frame.</p><p><strong>Why Indiegogo</strong> - We have been working on brand new product over the last<br/>couple of months and investing our personal money, time, research and<br/>resources. We have come far and we have refined the Power Snap Band to make<br/>it the best powerbank on the market.</p><p>The funds raised with our indiegogo will be used to finalize molding, meet small order for the first run, marketing, and order production bringing Power Snap Band to the world for everyone to enjoy. We chose Indiegogo because over the last several years this has been a hub for entrepreneurs and dream-chasers to realize their goals and bring an idea to life. Check out our Website <a href=""http://www.powersnapband.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.powersnapband.com</a>, bring advance technology to<br/>your devices.</p><p><strong>Risks and challenges</strong></p><p>With any project, there are risks and challenges that must be considered before going forward. These can include:</p><p>● Supply Chain: Manufacturing Delay</p><p>A delay in the supply chain would cause us to miss our promised shipping deadlines. We don’t anticipate that this will become a problem, as we have developed really close relationships with our suppliers and have worked out a generous timeline that we intend to beat.</p><p>● Fulfillment Capacity</p><p>If we generate a lot of interest and we get swamped with orders, it is possible that fulfillment and shipping will be delayed.

The problem is that I use it so much I run out of power.Hi my name is Todd Burnham,I am the co-founder and creator of the Power Snap Band. Do you remember the 90’s when the snap bracelet was “THE” thing? Well I do and I know how much fun people had with them. I took that blast from the past and made it the new “IT” thing! How? I put in a 800 MAH rechargeable battery that is just enough power to get you through until the next charge! It is lightweight, stylish, fun and comes with 3 tips integrated into the band to allow you to charge any device that uses micro USB, USB-C or Lightning charging.Power Snap Band is perfect for an active lifestyle or for a night on the town when you really want to make sure you have access to your Map apps or so you can make sure you have enough juice to use your ride apps.When might I need a Power Snap Band? The short answer is you never know BUT times where I have used my Power Snap Band: Concerts, Jogging, Vacation, Airports, Kids ball games, when I saw Big Foot (just kidding he was too fast). You can get a power bank with a lot more power and trust me I have those to but I love the Power Snap Band for emergencies. I don’t always carry my bigger charger because I don’t want to be tethered to the cords I have to carry or if I take the one that has the built in cord it is too large to put in my pocket. Power Snap Band is small but mighty. You can’t plan an emergency BUT you can have an emergency plan. Make Power Snap Band part of your emergency prep and always be prepared!   Power Snap Band Let Your Charge Apple Devices!Power Snap Band Also Charge Type-C or USB-C Devices!Power Snap Band Also Charge Micro Devices!Photo GalleryPower Snap Band 360 View Video Showing More Videos and Demo of Power Snap Band Working Prototype

<h3>     WiFiBoostGo: #CyberWiFi not science-fiction</h3>
<p>You've probably wasted tons of precious MB's with your
carrier; you may have even switched companies in the hope of a better network,
but have discovered that </p>
<p><b><i>            the more things change the more they stay the
same.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i></i></b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1031784/files/20141120043033-scene4.jpg?1416486633"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p><b>We know the score</b>. That's why we've developed WiFiBoostGo. You see,
our phones are the problem. My phone (no matter what phone I use) and ALL other
devices trying to get a decent WiFi connection contribute to huge traffic
spikes, low bandwidth sharing &amp; poor- or no-WiFi reception, even at
powerful HotSpots.</p>
<p> No-one will ever tell you this; especially if they're trying
to sell you the latest edition of the ""Supernova Smartphone"" or
whatever.</p>
<p>Cue MonzGear - <i>that's us</i> -
a tech-savvy group of developers based in Hong Kong, where we've developed the
WiFiBoostGo; an environment where the chances of winning the Lottery are <b>better</b> than getting an uninterrupted WiFi
signal.</p>
<p></p>

<br/>
<p> During Research and Development on the <b>WiFiBoostGo</b> we focused  on smartphones, but since we're tech junkies, we discovered
during our stringent R&amp;D process, that WiFiBoostGo can also <b>super-charge</b> Notebooks,
Tablets, Laptops &amp; even Desktop PC's.</p>

<h3>Technical Specifications:</h3>
<p>The tech specs for WiFiBoostGo depend on the weight
class. We are currently appraising 2 versions: <i>SLIM</i> &amp; <b>BOLD</b>. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1031815/files/20141120044502-WiFiweight.png?1416487502"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<p>The SLIM version is a 3000mAh
battery powered unit, which gives up to 3 charges for a mobile phone, and the <b>BOLD</b> version, with a 6000mAh battery
which can recharge any mobile phone 5 times before recharging.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Phone recharging with WiFiBoostGo is an exchange of the same power source, thus your battery
does not strain to convert the energy. </span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">WiFiBoostGo itself requires a power
socket to recharge once the juice runs dry, but once topped-up it will drive
your mobile devices once they start to fade.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Both <i>SLIM</i> &amp; <b>BOLD</b> are lightweight,
compact &amp; robust power-houses -what else would you expect from a #CyberWiFi
concept?</span></p>

<h3>WiFiBoostGo &amp; The Indiegogo Campaign: Why we need you</h3>
<p>We’ve turned to Indiegogo to open our idea to you, the
awesome community of tech-savvy travelers of the world; to learn from you and with
your support get this product faster to market. Our product components are
almost ready for tooling and then mass production, but only your help will get
us there. </p>
<p>The expertise for manufacturing products is at hand;
we have partnered with manufacturers with tremendous experiences in the
electronics industry eager to give the recycled bit a shot: and together we can
make this happen.</p>
<p>R &amp; D (Research &amp; Development) is done, and
our prototype is ready to hit the production line.</p>
<p>With this campaign we want to ensure that our
resources and final product are environmentally safe. Components that can be
recycled &amp; are environment friendly and bio-degradable.  We want to do
our part for a cleaner eco-system.</p>
<p>As most electronic manufacturers are in Asia, the
biggest problem is pollution, our designs include plans for a fully
bio-gradable casing as well as all non-essential components be made from
recycled materials.</p>
<p>Funds from the campaign will resource 5 steps of the
production &amp; distribution  process:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Finalize the
     Design &amp; Procure Recycled raw materials</b></li>
<li><b>Meet
     Minimum Production Requirements</b></li>
<li><b>Trial

<h3>Color Coded Coolness:</h3>
<p>WiFiBoostGo is dressed in the coolest color of them
all: Black.</p>
<p>They say that the devil is in the details, and so
we've created 4 color schemes for both <i>SLIM</i>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges: </h3>
<h3>Development, Production &amp; Distribution</h3>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">As we've already developed the WiFiBoostGo prototype
and have tested it in the most demanding of WiFi reception environments (bars,
restaurants, lounges &amp; cafes in Hong Kong)  the main challenge is in maintaining the same
high standards with the proposed procurement plan in an awesome design. Global
electronic device requirements have already been met, including the stringent
FCC in effect in most of North America and Europe.</span><br/></p>
<p><b>""...we'd rather plan for the greatest margin of error... than sell you some half-baked lie every month with a vague email...""<br/></b></p>
<p>
<br/>
Being located in Shenzhen's manufacturing hub, we are in situ of the planet's
greatest software and electronics production environment (Hint: it's not
Silicon Valley), so it is very simple for us to focus on these research,
development and manufacturing issues. We are working directly with the
component suppliers and recycled-parts manufactures to ensure the highest
quality for WiFiBoostGo. We appreciate your confidence in us and we promise to
deliver to you the best *boosting* experience possible.</p>
<p>Intellectual Property(IP) Rights are very important and we ensure that all our parts are manufactured in separate and undisclosed OEM's so that there will be no chance of some hacked-product hitting the market 6 months after you've received your WiFiBoostGo. <br/></p>
<p>We've given Alpha &amp; Beta Testing a large time-window for incidentals. </p>
<p>After the Alpha production run at these separate facilities, the componnets are assemebled, tested, tweaked and modified if necessary and the re-design is sent for Beta production and the cycle repeats. When we're satisfied that the product is reaady, we order the main production run, collect &amp; assemble the components, marvel and gleam at this cool invention that YOU have held make possible and ship the WiFiBoostGlo to YOU. These large time windows are there to ensure that we can deliver in the time that we have stated. </p>
<p>We don't want to burst your bubble by sending you an ""Oops! Sorry, but production has been postponed"" sop-story. No! We'd rather be straight-up and plan for the greatest margin of error than try to pull the wool over your eyes and keep feeding you some half-baked lie every month with an obscure &amp; vague email...</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Our Research &amp; Development facilities lack the necessary Tooling &amp; Construction platforms, so we have budgeted for the purchase and/or production of specific tooling for moulds and components. Quality, Assurance and Certificates for Health, Safety and other Regulatory organizations are obtained through an inspection process by globally recognized entities within the industry.</span></p>

and bio-degradable materials on the non-essential parts, such as the casing and
other components. The sensitive hardware has been made from materials that are not
toxic to the environment even if they are discarded. Our approach is to
minimize damage to the environment. We can say that WiFiBoostGo is 100%
Eco-Friendly.</p>

Smartphones have become a daily part of our lives. For business,
pleasure or a bit of both, we all use our phones to surf the web and to connect
with our own. 

                                                                                                                                    


We've Research and Developed the concept of a #WiFiSignal booster and we're confident that with your help we can raise the funds necessary to produce #WiFiBoostGo and make it available to the public.
       WiFiBoostGo: 4 power-ups for your iPhone!


 #SciFiReality for #TheInternetOfThings...
So what do we need the most for our phones?  We all  love
our smart-phones, although sometimes we wish they could do more!
Ideally we want crystal-clear WiFi
reception, a super-long battery life and some extra storage wouldn't hurt. And we want to manage it all from a cool app.   

1. Excellent! Your new smartphone can brew coffee, lock the garage and draw your bath with the apps you’ve just installed. But you find that you’ve got to go to the kitchen and turn the machine on, stand right next to the garage to lock it and you might as well just take a shower.
WiFiBoostGo increases the range of the WiFi signal that your phone can actually achieve what these cool apps promise they can deliver.        

Even on new devices -  just like the iPhone 6
Plus with massive storage and a ""solid
24 hours talk-time "" - battery-drain & storage issues still
remain.  
2. WiFiBoostGo is packed with a huge battery which can recharge your phone in less than an hour and is good for 5 recharges; so you’ll never have to worry about looking for an outlet when your battery runs low.
3. Transfer files to the SD Card on the #WiFiBoostGo to free up space on your phone. We all know how quickly those GB’s can fill up: with WiFiBoostGo you can record and upload those viral videos you’ve never been able to capture at the time.
4. A Free App to find all WiFi spots, boost your phones WiFi signal, manage your smartphone so you can surf and store everything on the internet. You can download the WiFiBoostGo app for free from GooglePlay and the Apple Store.
A portable power-house for your mobile
phone; WiFiBoostGo boosts 4
aspects of your device:

Signal & Speed: Increases WiFi range by
     600%* for a stable WiFi internet signal - live streaming is a breeze
Stamina & Power: The super sized battery
     acts as an auxiliary power source to recharge your phone under any
     conditions
Storage & Space: A secondary external
     storage device; WiFiBoostGo can handle SD cards for added storage
     connections.
App Control: Download the WiFiBoostGo App
     for FREE on Google Play and the App Store and manage your content easily.


#WifiBoostGo features
state-of-the-art technology for maximum power gain on all devices: a portable
#PowerBank and extra storage for your iPhone.
                                                                                                                                 
     WiFiBoostGo: #CyberWiFi not science-fiction
You've probably wasted tons of precious MB's with your
carrier; you may have even switched companies in the hope of a better network,
but have discovered that 
            the more things change the more they stay the
same.



We know the score. That's why we've developed WiFiBoostGo. You see,
our phones are the problem. My phone (no matter what phone I use) and ALL other
devices trying to get a decent WiFi connection contribute to huge traffic
spikes, low bandwidth sharing & poor- or no-WiFi reception, even at
powerful HotSpots.
 No-one will ever tell you this; especially if they're trying
to sell you the latest edition of the ""Supernova Smartphone"" or
whatever.
Cue MonzGear - that's us -
a tech-savvy group of developers based in Hong Kong, where we've developed the
WiFiBoostGo; an environment where the chances of winning the Lottery are better than getting an uninterrupted WiFi
signal.



 During Research and Development on the WiFiBoostGo we focused  on smartphones, but since we're tech junkies, we discovered
during our stringent R&D process, that WiFiBoostGo can also super-charge Notebooks,
Tablets, Laptops & even Desktop PC's.
                                                                                                                                    
""In a nutshell, smart-phones really need an intelligent boost to make them
work properly...""



Speed, Stamina & Storage: we should have just said Sexy & Sleek!
The WiFiBoostGo Antenna : By improving the three fundamental antenna
parameters - antenna efficiency, antenna impedance and size which in this case really
does matter – WiFiBoostGo triples your phones’s WiFi signal range at
once. The LED display lights indicate the connection levels of WiFi
signals in the vicinity. Activate the Signal Booster and juice up the range to
600%*.

Outdoors:



The following  images illustrate the extraordinary
gain in WiFi reception, boosted Frame & Ping rates, plus amazing gains in
connection (The results are screenshots from the OOKLA Speedtest App for
iPhones. For in-depth results go to www.monzgear.com.)

       
  <-- Before & After -->   

Speed: Light is almost as fast!
OK. So this is really an over-the-top exaggeration, but with WiFiBoostGo you can stream live videos, play games, Skype and chat all with amazing clarity and not delay! WiFiBoostGo juices up your signal range by up to 600% so that your smart phone is always connected. 'Nuff said!



""...both SLIM & BOLD... are lightweight, compact & robust power-houses...what else would you expect from a #CyberWiFi concept?""





Stamina: High Nitro Factor
WiFiBoostGo has a high capacity 6000mAh Lithium
Polymer Battery (BOLD Version) with a High Nitro Factor, high-speed charging
technology which can recharge your phone 5X faster than an ordinary
adapter. 
This makes WiFiBoostGo the fastest charging portable battery pack
on the market. Super-charge
your phone in just 30 minutes; fully charge an iPhone, Sony, Samsung, Nokia or
HTC Smartphone on-the-go without
the need of a power outlet. 
A PowerBank with huge reserves (The NITRO  version is even bigger!)
The WiFiBoostGo's  power bank rapid
charge design allows for seamless power transfer.

USB2.0 to transfer energy to your iPhone and
     tablet
Supports Qualcomm Quick-Charge 2.0 rapid charge
Supports Apple 2.4mode (Maximun 2.4A@5V)
Samsung
     Galaxy Tablet & Samsung Phones
Power adapter for global sockets to
     charge the WiFiBoostGo

The #PowerBank battery
utilizes the HVDCP* method for rapid power exchange 



* High-Voltage Dedicated Charging Port 
Storage: Stockpile your Database
WiFiBoostGo  also has  SD Card Storage slot with which
you can increase your phones storage capacity by up to 128 GB. All SD cards can
be accommodated. Transfer files from your Camera Roll or from your Docs folder
or store your favourite playlists without filling-up your phone.



App Control: Dashboard Dominance
Manage all of #WiFiBoostGo from the Home Screen on your
iPhone or Tablet. Download the App and manage your WiFi connections, transfer
files seamlessly to other devices, find strong signals in the area and link
them so that you're never off-line. Once WiFiBoostGo hits the production line, the app will be made available for Free on GooglePlay, the Apple Store and our own website.
The App will also tell you when you
smartphone's battery is low so you can BOOST with the WiFiBoostGo  and also how many recharges of your phone it can handle before you
need to fill-it-up, so to speak.
                             
(The above image is from the prototype app for iPhones, Android & Blackberry smartphones. For an example of a working version, head on over to http://monzgear.com)
Technical Specifications:
The tech specs for WiFiBoostGo depend on the weight
class. We are currently appraising 2 versions: SLIM & BOLD. 

The SLIM version is a 3000mAh
battery powered unit, which gives up to 3 charges for a mobile phone, and the BOLD version, with a 6000mAh battery
which can recharge any mobile phone 5 times before recharging.
Phone recharging with WiFiBoostGo is an exchange of the same power source, thus your battery
does not strain to convert the energy. 
WiFiBoostGo itself requires a power
socket to recharge once the juice runs dry, but once topped-up it will drive
your mobile devices once they start to fade.
Both SLIM & BOLD are lightweight,
compact & robust power-houses -what else would you expect from a #CyberWiFi
concept?
                                                                                                                                   
WiFiBoostGo & The Indiegogo Campaign: Why we need you
We’ve turned to Indiegogo to open our idea to you, the
awesome community of tech-savvy travelers of the world; to learn from you and with
your support get this product faster to market. Our product components are
almost ready for tooling and then mass production, but only your help will get
us there. 
The expertise for manufacturing products is at hand;
we have partnered with manufacturers with tremendous experiences in the
electronics industry eager to give the recycled bit a shot: and together we can
make this happen.
R & D (Research & Development) is done, and
our prototype is ready to hit the production line.
With this campaign we want to ensure that our
resources and final product are environmentally safe. Components that can be
recycled & are environment friendly and bio-degradable.  We want to do
our part for a cleaner eco-system.
As most electronic manufacturers are in Asia, the
biggest problem is pollution, our designs include plans for a fully
bio-gradable casing as well as all non-essential components be made from
recycled materials.
Funds from the campaign will resource 5 steps of the
production & distribution  process:

Finalize the
     Design & Procure Recycled raw materials
Meet
     Minimum Production Requirements
Trial
     Production & Final Testing 
Final
     Production

Monster
     SKY
WiFi
     Surveillance Camcorder

(Both are application driven devices to enhance various features of your smartphone/tablet)
Our development team has contributed to the Wireless Technology
that drives other Portable Wireless Devices on the market
Our vision is to design and develop innovative
products directly for consumers, without the middleman; producing  environmentally sound and #EcoFriendly
electronics. This makes for flexible products, with an intrinsic value based on
more than just economics! 
                                                                                                                                  



Color Coded Coolness:
WiFiBoostGo is dressed in the coolest color of them
all: Black.
They say that the devil is in the details, and so
we've created 4 color schemes for both SLIM
& BOLD versions: These are
Cherry Acid Red, Gold Flow Stallion, Lime Wire Green & Electric Heaven
Blue. Cool names for cool colours!


Exclusively for our Indiegogo sponsors, we've created
the WiFiBoostGlo, yes you read correctly it was not a typo, WiFiBoostGlo has a glowing antenna to
indicate power status.

                                                                                                                                  
Risks & Challenges: 
Development, Production & Distribution
As we've already developed the WiFiBoostGo prototype
and have tested it in the most demanding of WiFi reception environments (bars,
restaurants, lounges & cafes in Hong Kong)  the main challenge is in maintaining the same
high standards with the proposed procurement plan in an awesome design. Global
electronic device requirements have already been met, including the stringent
FCC in effect in most of North America and Europe.
""...we'd rather plan for the greatest margin of error... than sell you some half-baked lie every month with a vague email...""


Being located in Shenzhen's manufacturing hub, we are in situ of the planet's
greatest software and electronics production environment (Hint: it's not
Silicon Valley), so it is very simple for us to focus on these research,
development and manufacturing issues. We are working directly with the
component suppliers and recycled-parts manufactures to ensure the highest
quality for WiFiBoostGo. We appreciate your confidence in us and we promise to
deliver to you the best *boosting* experience possible.
Intellectual Property(IP) Rights are very important and we ensure that all our parts are manufactured in separate and undisclosed OEM's so that there will be no chance of some hacked-product hitting the market 6 months after you've received your WiFiBoostGo. 
We've given Alpha & Beta Testing a large time-window for incidentals. 
After the Alpha production run at these separate facilities, the componnets are assemebled, tested, tweaked and modified if necessary and the re-design is sent for Beta production and the cycle repeats. When we're satisfied that the product is reaady, we order the main production run, collect & assemble the components, marvel and gleam at this cool invention that YOU have held make possible and ship the WiFiBoostGlo to YOU. These large time windows are there to ensure that we can deliver in the time that we have stated. 
We don't want to burst your bubble by sending you an ""Oops! Sorry, but production has been postponed"" sop-story. No! We'd rather be straight-up and plan for the greatest margin of error than try to pull the wool over your eyes and keep feeding you some half-baked lie every month with an obscure & vague email...
Our Research & Development facilities lack the necessary Tooling & Construction platforms, so we have budgeted for the purchase and/or production of specific tooling for moulds and components. Quality, Assurance and Certificates for Health, Safety and other Regulatory organizations are obtained through an inspection process by globally recognized entities within the industry.
                                                                                                                                  
Perks For Our Backers
A note to our Backers: A $10 Shipping Fee has been included into
the amount for the Perks.

The $5 perk is a Big Banner with your name on it! This
too will find it's way to your inbox. You can use this Banner on your own
web-page if you wish, but your name will go down in Monzgear history and onto

We are a group of passionate tertiary students aspiring to be technopreneurs. Our idea for EzBand came about when we were having difficulty making payment on public transports. We noticed that many students carry their laptops with one hand and use the other to dig around their bags or wallet looking for their payment card. We also realise that elderly usually hang their passes around their neck. We were inspired to do something about this and thus EzBand.

Handy Thumbdrive 



Why EzBand?EzBand will not only ease peoples’ life, it can also act as a fashion accessory and also helps forgetful elderly, teenagers who are in a rush, people who frequently misplace their cards, people who have too many cards.

<br/>Primary range of the Findy covers a distance of up to 150 feet. Keep in mind that the Findy is not currently able to calculate that distance and reflect its measurement on the interface of the control panel, but it is programmed to help you to easily and quickly determine the strength of the signal as you get closer to and farther away from the object that is being tracked.<br/><br/><p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/108607/files/20130921121341-leash.png?1380727382"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p></p>
<p>As soon as one of the devices being tracked gets disconnected or goes out of range and loses the actual signal, the control panel will notify the user so that they can resolve the issue accordingly. This feature will also map the last location when that device was connected so that you can effectively retrace your steps in order to retrieve the item if necessary.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/108609/files/20130921121532-share.png?1380727398"" src="""" style=""width: 577.4666666666667px; height: 305px;""/></p>
<br/><p></p>
<p>Another benefit of the Findy is that you will be able to stay connected with your friends through this system so that you can help them to keep track of their things as they help you to keep track of yours. A ""Friend's Findy"" signal will flash whenever you are close to their devices so that you can quickly contact the owner to let them know what you have found. There truly is so much that you can accomplish by using the Findy system and its innovative design has still left plenty of room for growth and more enhancements in the near future.<br/></p>

These buttons were designed to be stylish and discreet in order to prevent any visual eyesores from emerging. For example, if you were to attach one of the buttons to your car keys, it would appear to be just another key chain that easily blends in with all of the other key chains that you have accumulated.Each button comes with a tiny light that flashes and flickers as well as a small speaker,so you will be able to hear and even see them once they have been activated through your control panel during a search.


""Findy Remote is small, priceless controller with Bluetooth  4.0 technology, that helps you keep track of everything.This device is especially created for those people who would like to have separate controller at their home, office, or even garage instead of using their daily phone. It makes finding things even more comfortable! It is also wonderful solution for those who own older models of phones that do not support Bluetooth 4.0 technology.""

































Primary range of the Findy covers a distance of up to 150 feet. Keep in mind that the Findy is not currently able to calculate that distance and reflect its measurement on the interface of the control panel, but it is programmed to help you to easily and quickly determine the strength of the signal as you get closer to and farther away from the object that is being tracked.


As soon as one of the devices being tracked gets disconnected or goes out of range and loses the actual signal, the control panel will notify the user so that they can resolve the issue accordingly. This feature will also map the last location when that device was connected so that you can effectively retrace your steps in order to retrieve the item if necessary.



Another benefit of the Findy is that you will be able to stay connected with your friends through this system so that you can help them to keep track of their things as they help you to keep track of yours. A ""Friend's Findy"" signal will flash whenever you are close to their devices so that you can quickly contact the owner to let them know what you have found. There truly is so much that you can accomplish by using the Findy system and its innovative design has still left plenty of room for growth and more enhancements in the near future.

<p>We have been working on arco since March 2014. We now have a functioning prototype which we are quite excited about. As you can see arco works quite well with iOS devices. However, we don't want to stop here. We want arco to be accessible even for android users. Hence we are developing the app to do so. </p>
<p>We would also like you to have features that will allow you to customise arco. The app will allow you to play with vivid colours and assign it to your notification types. More information on specifics will be provided as we progress.</p>
<p>The next phase for arco will be to finalise the electronics designs and develop the PCB. This will enable us to make arco slimmer than our prototype. In parallel we will be working on the app development to add the customisation features.</p>
<p>The prototype was developed in house. However, to provide best quality product, we will outsource PCB design and App development to an expert team that we have good relations with. Details on this and our manufacturers will be provided once they allow us to share.</p>
<p>Once the campaign ends, we will give a green signal to our manufacturers to create the mould for the casing. It should take 40 days for them to make one. Meanwhile we will also send our final PCB designs for mass manufacturing. </p>
<p>Once we receive them, we will integrate it, test it and ship it to you as soon as possible. We expect to ship arco in April 2015.</p>
<p>We will keep you updated throughout our journey. However, if you need any more details, please contact us directly on hello@meworksco.com and we will be happy to answer your queries.</p>

<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div>We have come a long way to create a prototype that works with iOS device without an app. However, since we want android users to be able to use arco and allow customisation, we are developing the app. </div>
<div>The only risk that we see is the app development taking a longer than expected time. However, we have enough time to complete the app before we ship the product and we are positive that we can achieve it. Android connectivity to send notifications is possible as it already exists in other products. So we are not facing any difficult challenges of implementing these extra features. We will keep you updated with our progress.</div>
<div>To make this project a reality, we need to achieve our minimum goal of $40,000 so we can get our moulds made, app developed etc. The main challenge that we see is not being able to achieve this goal through Indiegogo. However, we would like to be positive and  we are not going to give up till we reach our goal.</div>

<p><span><b>What is arco?</b></span></p>
<p>Arco is a smart reactor that connects to your smartphone via bluetooth and reacts to your phone notifications. Never miss important notifications or phone calls when you are away from your phone in style.</p>
<p><b>  </b></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FLQw9DOCiJdg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DLQw9DOCiJdg%26list%3DUU935XcUMmkV9umM2_b05krg%26index%3D6&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FLQw9DOCiJdg%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p></p>
<p><b>How does it work?</b></p>
<p>Its simple. Just connect it to your smartphone by pairing bluetooth and wait for notifications. Depending on your notification, it will blink different colours. For example, if you get a facebook notification, it will blink blue. If you are getting call it will notify you with red flash, if you get an email it will blink green and so on. (It works without any app with iOS devices)</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>How can I use it?</b><b style=""background-color: initial;""></b></p>
<p style=""display: inline !important;"">You can wear it on your t shirt, place it on your work desk, keep it on your bed side table or place it on your car dash. Basically anywhere you like to be visually notified of your important notifications.</p>

 </p><p>Chris Stahel started VividLite in 2009 when he handmade his 
first wireless led up-light.  He had been working in the event industry 
at that time and was searching for a solution to his own lighting 
frustrations. He was tired of running wires and wasting hours of each 
day setting up event lighting only to break it down again at the end of 
the day.  When he couldn't find the wireless light that he was looking 
for... He set out to make one himself and a few weeks later, VividLite 
was born.

As soon as word got out about the new light, sales started to come in 
quickly.  Chris knew that he needed help and wanted someone on his team 
to help bring products to the next level.</p><p>Ken Wu joined shortly 
after the company was created and had a strong background in product 
development and manufacturing.  Having worked for years in smartphone

that working together with Chris was a great match.  The two of them 
partnered up to bring the original product to new levels as well as to 
create new innovative and exciting products.

<h2>Welcome!</h2>
<h3>What's My Page?</h3>
<p>My Page is an app, which allows you to create your own website in just a few minutes. You just need to choose a website-design, set the title and description and fill in the content you want to place on your website. The app is currently only available on the iOS App Store and this is what i want to change.</p>
<p>Everything started 6 month ago, as my mother asked me to build her, her own website. As i started working on her website, i got the idea to create an app, which allows her to build up her website on her own.</p>
<p>After many sleepless nights of constructing, programming, drinking coffee and performing magic tricks, i created an prototype of the app, which is now available for iPhones, iPads and iPods. <a href=""http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/my-page/id500797356?mt=8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">[Get it!]</a>.</p>

What's My Page?
My Page is an app, which allows you to create your own website in just a few minutes. You just need to choose a website-design, set the title and description and fill in the content you want to place on your website. The app is currently only available on the iOS App Store and this is what i want to change.
Everything started 6 month ago, as my mother asked me to build her, her own website. As i started working on her website, i got the idea to create an app, which allows her to build up her website on her own.
After many sleepless nights of constructing, programming, drinking coffee and performing magic tricks, i created an prototype of the app, which is now available for iPhones, iPads and iPods. [Get it!].
Give me website-samples!
The following link provides a sample website, which has been created with the app My Page.

What's next?
I'm currently working on the following points. Your support would help me a lot to finish everything quite faster.

For this reason, <b>the Mountek SWITCH will only work in Canada, Mexico, and the USA at this time</b>. However, if you live in any other country, you can still benefit by mounting your devices and mobile accessories on your wall. The <b>SWITCH GLOBAL </b>is<b> </b>the only perk that will ship worldwide, since it does not have to be installed over a specific type of light switch.<b> </b>It<b> </b>comes non-powered WITHOUT USB ports or LED lighting. To install, simply peel off 3M adhesive backing and stick to a smooth surface. As shown below, it will ship with a removable switch cover (highlighted in blue). You'll also have the add-on option to replace the two screws with accessory pegs. As an added bonus, the SWITCH GLOBAL ships in October, earlier than any other perk:<br/></p>

</div></div>","The Mountek SWITCH celebrates our 5th crowdfunding campaign! It's never been easy to deliver on thousands of orders at once, but with the faith and generosity of the Indiegogo community, we've successfully delivered on four innovations to date. See our most recent InDemand campaigns for the Mountek AIRSNAP and Mountek GRIP+, both now featured on Amazon Launchpad. Our smartphone car mounts have moved on to become best sellers on Amazon with rave editorial reviews. With your help, we aim to do the same with the Mountek SWITCH, for seamless integration between you, your phone, your car, and your home. 



If you like what you've seen so far, that was just practice. Shown in the campaign video are merely proof of concept protoypes. At this time, we'd like to share the updated 3D drawings of the Mountek SWITCH (as of May 24, 2016).
WE MAKE MOUNTS. That's our specialty. The Mountek SWITCH was designed with elegance and function in mind. When not in use, it hides flush with the wall. So your visitors won't even notice that it's anything but a regular light switch! When you need the mount, side grips and support legs spring open to accept your device.The Mountek SWITCH has been designed to support any smartphone and tablet up to the width of a full-size iPad.



Engineered to support the weight of a full-size iPad, the Mountek SWITCH features a 3-way pivot arm made of galvanized steel. 

USB ports have now been hidden underneath the SWITCH panels. 2 ports are positioned beneath the actual switches, and 1 port is positioned beneath the mounting platform.


[Unlocked if $50K stretch goal is met]


[Unlocked if $100K stretch goal is met]









One of the biggest challenges in designing the Mountek SWITCH is that switch panels are all different around the world. For this reason, the Mountek SWITCH will only work in Canada, Mexico, and the USA at this time. However, if you live in any other country, you can still benefit by mounting your devices and mobile accessories on your wall. The SWITCH GLOBAL is the only perk that will ship worldwide, since it does not have to be installed over a specific type of light switch. It comes non-powered WITHOUT USB ports or LED lighting. To install, simply peel off 3M adhesive backing and stick to a smooth surface. As shown below, it will ship with a removable switch cover (highlighted in blue). You'll also have the add-on option to replace the two screws with accessory pegs. As an added bonus, the SWITCH GLOBAL ships in October, earlier than any other perk:






The Mountek SWITCH is compatible with the following four switch types. If you have any of these standardized switch plates, your Mountek SWITCH will install into the existing screw pattern. No drilling necessary. 




At the end of the campaign, you'll receive an email to select from 4 different types of switch patterns. Contribution amount for each perk is the same regardless of which types you will choose. Here are the 4 available types:



Completely cut the cords with wireless charging. Every Mountek SWITCH can be upgraded to wirelessly charge your Qi enabled devices. Wireless charging at the fastest speeds available will be unlocked if we reach our $100k stretch goal. At that amount, we can procure supplies in high volume and pass the savings onto you. Our target price point for each Qi Wireless upgrade is $30. NOTE: The newer Samsung phones are already Qi enabled. Apple smartphones do not have built-in wireless charging yet, but you can buy aftermarket cases that will give your iPhone this capability. Not sure if your phone is Qi enabled? Visit this link from your smartphone and this website will let you know:  http://qi-wireless-charging.net/check/







Single tool install. Only a screwdriver is required to install the Mountek SWITCH.

No drilling. The Mountek SWITCH replaces your current faceplate and installs into existing screw holes. 


Minimal wiring. Your existing light switch(es) will remain in place. Simply clamp into existing wiring to power the Mountek SWITCH. *Step-by-step instructions will be included to ensure safe and proper installation.

Reversible. Worried about wall space? The convertible device mounting platform can be installed on either the left OR right side of your existing switch(es).















This is the absolute minimum amount we need to deliver a feature rich Mountek SWITCH. Help us make our vision a reality and never lose your charger again!




For loyal Mountek backers, we've created a Mountek Connector. Snap your car mount onto a connecting ball joint, so you can mount a SECOND device on the same switch! More details later...Keep your keys, shades, and bluetooth headset where you can find them. 
















We believe in complete transparency and keeping our backers informed. Campaign updates will be posted with progress pics and videos, once each key milestone is met.

<div style=""text-align: justify;"">G-Power contains Li-polymer batteries. Thus they are lighter and have negligible memory effect which means they are efficient and lightweight with no false charge indicators.

</div></div>","Tired of charging your smartphone or tablet? Use a power bank to keep you moving. But what capacity? Why limit yourself with lower capacity chargers or add bulk to your bags with those heavy bricks. Go ahead and build your own custom capacity charger in seconds. Yes, thats true. Welcome G-Power from Mustustech!
What is G-Power?
G-Power is the ultimate power bank for all your needs. Be it your iPhone, iPad, Kindle or any such device in the market, this charger will add juice to its veins in no time. Based on the building blocks philosophy, the user decides what capacity power bank he wants to have. Just add the desired number of add-on modules and multiply the capacity. The best part is, the add-on modules also provide unique functions of their own. So, why limit yourself to a single function, uninteresting charger when you can have this awesome piece of technology!
 





G-Power contains Li-polymer batteries. Thus they are lighter and have negligible memory effect which means they are efficient and lightweight with no false charge indicators. Even the common problem with the cheaper Li-Ion batteries where after little use, the battery charge would drop suddenly, is not an issue here. Due to their inherent quality, Li-Polymer batteries are found in all the high quality devices like iPhones and what can be a better companion than the G-Power. 
Every G-Power unit contains three important pieces:


Main Controller Board (6000 mAh capacity inbuilt)
Daughter Board (6000 mAh capacity add-on)
Solar Board (Yup, environment friendly and makes life easy!)





























This highly efficient solar board would charge the G-Power throughout the day. It even works in shade. Don't expect miracles from it, its not a fast charger but it will come in handy when you are stuck on a mountain with no power to charge your GPS. 




The solar panel is of very high efficiency. It will work even in very low light conditions


The Charge Base
Wait a sec !  Have I mentioned a ""Fast Charger"" ?
 



Yes, this is the charge base for the G-Power. It will completely charge the 12000 mAh battery in approximately 3 hours. Simply connect it to the mains using the supplied wall charger and you have the G-Power charge base up and running in no time. It also contains a micro-usb input so your phone charger can also be used to power it.

Here are the dimensions:


That empty slot? Well, that contains a high quality tangle free flat cable for you!

Here's the deal. This charge base not only helps in charging the G-Power, it also helps in using it in its full glory. As I have mentioned earlier, you decide what capacity you want. This added capacity has heavier charging needs. Here you see how it goes :






 Isn't this amazing !

Decide what you want....











Something more to add!
Now, here's the icing on this multi-layered cake...

I am hoping to start shipping these world-wide before August 2015, but early adopters and crowd-sourced backers will get them far in advance of that. My patent covers the technology behind the speed of these systems, and can be used in almost any device requiring a computer processor - watches, phones, tablets, laptops, desktops, servers, televisions, cars, drones... the list goes on. That should be enough to get you hooked... but if not, please read on. The Fenton processing system will require less energy to run as it is using the latest technologies under the hood – things like graphene, spintronics and tunnelling resonators. No cooling fans, and equipped with solid state drives, mean as close to silent operation as you can get, and all running on less energy… GREEN, GREENER, GREENEST! What do I need from you? I am trying to raise some cash to start production of this device, and with 2-billion tablets, laptops and computers out there being replaced almost every three years, you don’t want to be left behind. So, please be a pioneer and help me get this product to market. I am offering a fantastic deal for early adopters as the first of these devices will expect to go to market at around the £1000 mark. So, step into the future and jump on board. Thank you for reading this far.Martin Inventor, Pioneer... the David in the Goliath.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3 style=""padding-top: 10px;"">Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>We are working hard to make Pixsso a high-quality product that fits just right into our lives; however, unexpected challenges can occur in this journey that we are planning to mitigate as follows:</p>
<p><b>Procurement:</b> We have already established a relationship with our electronic paper provider to license their technology into our product but we have yet to finalize the purchase. To minimize risks, we are planning to purchase the core electronics components first, followed by the remaining commodity components.</p>
<p><b>Manufacturing:</b> Our team has manufactured several hardware solutions and we are confident we can deliver Pixsso to you. However, to mitigate any potential manufacturing delays, we are ramping up manufacturing slowly and negotiating quality standards from our partners.</p>
<p><b>Software:</b> Our team has experience shipping backend professional software. However, there is a potential risk of being rejected from the app store during the review process. To mitigate this risk, we would ship Android first followed by a delayed version of the iPhone app.</p>
<p>We are committed to make the right calls for you, our customer. With your support, there is no doubt we will make Pixsso a success!</p><p><br/></p>
<h3 style=""padding-top: 10px;"">FAQ</h3>

Q: There is almost no information on the app, and no information about integrating with my own software (important for myself and others!). <div>
<div>
<br/><div><i> A: At Pixsso we believe in open source software, we are planning on making all of the code available in Github under MIT license. </i></div>
<div><i><br/></i></div>
<div> Q: The price point seems a bit steep, what's up with that?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><i> A: We would like more than anything to offer a lower price point, but since this a hardware project and we need to source all the materials this is the lowest we can go. If we end up selling more Pixsso's we might be able to go lower! </i></div>
<div><i><br/></i></div>
<div> Q: The display is too small! (or too big) I think you should make it bigger/smaller. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><i> A: We hear you, the current size is what we decided on after much deliberation as to what size would be the most useful. But if the people want something larger in the future we are open to it.</i></div>

Manufacturing: Our team has manufactured several hardware solutions and we are confident we can deliver Pixsso to you. However, to mitigate any potential manufacturing delays, we are ramping up manufacturing slowly and negotiating quality standards from our partners.
Software: Our team has experience shipping backend professional software. However, there is a potential risk of being rejected from the app store during the review process. To mitigate this risk, we would ship Android first followed by a delayed version of the iPhone app.
We are committed to make the right calls for you, our customer. With your support, there is no doubt we will make Pixsso a success!
FAQ

Q: There is almost no information on the app, and no information about integrating with my own software (important for myself and others!). 

 A: At Pixsso we believe in open source software, we are planning on making all of the code available in Github under MIT license. 

 Q: The price point seems a bit steep, what's up with that?

 A: We would like more than anything to offer a lower price point, but since this a hardware project and we need to source all the materials this is the lowest we can go. If we end up selling more Pixsso's we might be able to go lower! 

 Q: The display is too small! (or too big) I think you should make it bigger/smaller. 

 A: We hear you, the current size is what we decided on after much deliberation as to what size would be the most useful. But if the people want something larger in the future we are open to it.",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div><h3>6-Port USB with up to 2.4A each  </h3><p>The Sawtooth dock has six (6) USB ports. Each port is capable of charging up to 2.4 A (amps) of current independently. Each port is equipped with firmware to automatically detect and select the optimal charging amps specifically for your device.</p><p><br/></p><h3>Standard and Qualcomm Quick Charge™ 2.0 Editions</h3><p>Choose from two versions. The Quick Charge 2.0 Edition has these USB ports that can detect Qualcomm Snapdragon chipset with Quick Charge 2.0 charging capability to charge at either 5V, 9V or 12V and charges up to 75% faster. The rest of the three USB ports will be configured with standard detection technology to charge Apple devices at 5V up to 2.4A. The Standard Edition, as the name implied, comes with six standard USB ports. </p><p>The Standard Edition is currently available and we will ship immediately. You will get your shipment within 7 days. The Quick Charge 2.0 Edition has to go through Qualcomm/UL compliance testing. It’s currently being tested by the chip manufacturer and an independent testing company in Shenzhen. The target delivery date of the Quick Charge 2.0 Edition is January/February 2016. </p><p><br/></p><h3>Charging, ECO, Safety and Protection</h3><p>Longer battery life and faster charging are what we demand of our smartphones.</p><p>High-end devices are now equipped with smart charging technology that signals the charger for appropriate voltage and current (amps). A smart charger, like the Sawtooth, analyses the signals and delivers the requested outputs.  </p><p>When the device is done charging, a smart charger should indicate it is done. Sawtooth does this with a white LED light, the light will go off when charging is complete. No further current is delivered to the port, a cool ECO friendly feature. </p><p>As a safety feature, Sawtooth is equipped with a surge protector. It also has protection for over-current, over-heating, over-voltage, and short-circuit. </p><p><br/></p><h3>BEST FOR </h3><h4>Reception Area of Your Business </h4><p>Increase customer happiness with a Sawtooth dock and charger in your reception area, waiting room, co-working area, bar, saloon, coffee shop, or restaurant.

We are prepared this time. We are starting early to plan our survey, stretch goals, packaging, invoicing and picking slips. We have identified and will apply appropriate human resources to prepare for fulfillment and to support the backers. All inquiries and questions will be answered within 24 hours, except on weekends.</p><p><br/></p><h3>Our Design Story, Innovation &amp; your Awesome Experience</h3><p>We received a request to have a multi device charger with the cables on the outside, specifically for use in public places. Having the cable outside is more manageable for businesses, libraries and other public areas where they may have no idea how many of their customers/patrons use Android or iPhone, and having the cable inside the box does not really work. With the sawtooth design and short and flat charging cables, we believe Sawtooth can also be used anywhere.</p><p>We started exploring various design ideas in October and adopted the sawtooth roof design very early in the design phase. We now have a final prototype and are ready for manufacturing.</p><p>We are also very serious about Quality Control in our manufacturing process. We not only have to develop test procedures for the circuit board assembly process, but also we need to impose Quality Control on our suppliers, especially the cable manufacturers. The cost to replace and reship defective units is very high, and everyone in Plashr strives to achieve no defects. </p><p>As you can see in the schedule below, Design and Prototyping, Printed Circuit Board Assembly (PCBA) Design and Testing, and QC Testing take up most of the time in our schedule.</p><p>Furthermore, we are very serious about preparing for fulfillment and supporting our backers. We are updating our IT infrastructure to use better Help Desk, Invoicing, Shipping, Billing and Payment systems. We want to answer all inquiries and questions within 24 hours except on weekends. We want to ship as early as possible. We want to send you notifications when your package is in transit and the tracking number when it’s with the carrier or postal service.</p><p>We are aiming for a totally awesome experience from the day you backed us, keeping you connected with us until you receive and open your reward.</p><p><br/></p><h3>Risks and challenges</h3><p>When we got involved in the All Dock project, we always felt very uncomfortable because we were in a weak position to manage the risk. The project was sourcing from different companies that did not communicate with each other, and it was questionable whether we were dealing with a trading company or an actual manufacturer. We parachuted into the project to get it delivered. There was no quality management system, nor was there an IT infrastructure to support fulfillment and customer service. What we experienced was typical of many crowdfunding projects, making them very risky.</p><p>We founded the Plashr platform because of our risky experience. Our goal with Plashr is to mitigate the manufacturing risk and to build the infrastructure to better distribute our products and serve our customers globally. We achieved this by partnering and offering a compelling value proposition to the right manufacturers. With a manufacturer in the founding team, we are now vertically integrated with access to everything; PCB (design, assembly and firmware programming), injection molding design/production and product assembly. We are also putting in place a Quality Management System across the entire supply chain, including at our supplier factory. In short, we are addressing the risk at the root of the problem.</p><p>Nevertheless, there will still be unforeseen circumstances going forward. Some we can foresee early, but some may pop up during execution. For example, we have been told there is a backlog in the supply of Apple-certified chipsets for lightning connectors. We are still engineering our circuit board to combine Qualcomm Quick Charge 2.0 and existing USB handshake protocols/standards. We will announce how we will support Quick Charge 2.0 at 9V, 12V and 20V.</p><p>On the fulfillment front, we are working with logistic companies to pin down the most efficient and cost effective way to ship in the USA, EU countries, Australia, Canada, Japan and Greater China with no shipping and import duty/tax. Our goal is not to make money on shipping but to lower the cost of ownership of our product for everyone around the world. Today, we know where we can send with no shipping charges, and many countries have no import duty/tax below a certain amount. For the rest of the countries (not listed above) we have to impose a $20 shipping surcharge. As we uncover ways to ship to new countries, we will update you. If you know of a cheaper and effective way to ship to your country, please let us know.</p><p>Finally, we would like to add that our challenges go beyond Indiegogo. Indiegogo is a valuable launchpad to connect with our backers. We would be doing a disservice to our backers if we did not grow and bring more innovations to market. The Plashr brand is also the platform for how we are going to get there. We are developing the capability of selling online everywhere, including China.</p><p><br/></p><h3>FAQ</h3><h4>The width of the groove - does it fit device with thick cover/case?</h4><p>Yes, The groove between the ridges is about 0.91 inches (23 mm) at the top and 0.63 inches (16 mm) at the bottom. The groove is also deeper. It should be wide and deep enough to hold iPad and tablet with all cases and covers in the market today.</p><br/></div>","Inspired by the sawtooth roof architecture of the early 19th century, Sawtooth is a docking station comprising of a series of ridges to stand devices while charging on your desk, office, meeting room, classroom and anywhere at homeFeatured in

My name is Róbert Lencsés and i love to work with wood. At the time of mobile phones and TVs, made from plastic and electronics , people forget the essence and beauty of wood.My goal is to give every home a piece of nature reshaped into something nice and practical.And i need your help to achieve it.I invested a lot of hard work, effort and enthusiasm in design and production of wooden stands in order to provide my clients with first-class products. Types of wood that I useFrom left to rightWalnut, mahogany, mountain ash and zebrawood.  What I produce?I produce wooden stands for Apple products. So far I've made stands for : iPhone Docking station for iPhone  iPad mini, iPad 9.7"", iPad 12.9"" Universal stand for MacBook Apple Keyboard with Numeric KeypadRisk and challengesThere is no risk ! Even if the campaign failes, i still can make the wooden stand for you. It just takes a little longer. What i need For this project i need this amount of funds - 13 530 $9 723 $ for new CNC mill. For faster production.  The one i use is slow, old and in bad condition.2 264 $ for drum sander.  For surface sanding of wooden stands. Many times faster than me. 1 543 $ for oscillating spindle sander. As the previous machine, but this is for sanding edges.Also you can help me by telling your friends about my campaign,and/or sharing on Facebook.   What you getYou will get limited edition of my wooden stands with heart shape instead of Wood Stuffs logo.And big thank you from me.  What is needed to make a wooden stand ?Production begins by sawing  dry wooden timber to the required size.This process produces wood waste that finds use by my friend. He makes wooden handles for knives.  Then I plane the timber to produce a nice flat plate, which is then inserted into the CNC milling machine. On CNC mill i create a program for milling. When it is finished, each product must be manually sanded.Then is modified by radius cutter. At the end is every wooden stand treated with mineral oil and beeswax.   Features1. Made from real wood2. Durability3. Lifetime4. Unique FutureIn future i plan to create stands for more Apple products. I already have prototypes of wooden stands for Beats by dr.

We have spent quiet much time now and lots of brainstorming and waiting for the next prototype as well as lots of fun time up to this moment. </p>
<p>From the first scratch of a single travel backgammon to finally a 4 in 1 game set.</p>
<p>Proudly we can say, we are still alive and happy... due to our supporting friends and family.</p>
<p>In order to bring 2roll to you and the market. We have monetary goals to achieve.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;""><b>GOAL Indiegogo  = 15.888 USD</b></p>
<p>This money is necessary in order to produce at least 1 – 2 game colour combinations.</p>
<p>This is our biggest challenge to face - the minimum by colour (1000 pieces) and production MOQs for all items from tokens to fabric to labels and even screen printing. </p>
<p>We love our fashionable range, but we also understand now, that we need to watch our internal costs. We also understand, why there are only black and white and brown and white games on the market!!! Because who wants to take the risk to make a PINK game...the answer is: US! But therefore we need your support. </p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;""><b>GOAL SALES = 1.000 pcs / game combo</b></p>
<p>We are ambitious and eager to achieve 1.000 pcs by game combo colour. <span><br/></span>Then we will not have any leftovers of dices or tokens. </p>
<p>Therefore any corporate orders of airlines, banks or hotel chains are <span><br/></span>very welcome!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/524844/files/20140422044643-personalise_your_2roll.jpg?1398167203"" src="""" style=""""/></p> <p></p>
<p>But for sure we believe in every single  of „you“ who loves chess or backgammon, checkers or Nine Inch Morris to play while traveling. </p>

<p>As with all start-up projects, the main risk is to deliver everything within the estimated timeframe.</p>
<p>We have taken all possible production issues into consideration and planned our schedule accordingly. </p>
<p>All designs and material parts are finalized, tested and ready for production. <span><br/></span>If we raise our USD 15.888 target, we should all be right to delivery 2roll by Autumn 2014.</p>
<p>We also feel it's extremely important to make clear that 2roll in it's current format is a limited edition hobbyist product, and that is what supporters will essentially be acquiring through the play set rewards. </p>
<p>By backing the project you are helping us along with development and design of a better 2roll for the future, while acquiring the current version of the set.<span><br/></span></p><p></p></div>","2roll is a portable and lightweight game set containing the most popular board games: Backgammon, Chess, Checkers and Nine Men's Morris.

27 June 2014Ordering all items and handing over the production time lines with its deadlines to be reached.
30 June March 2014Getting
all confirmations of each single supplier to manage all deadlines
1 - 31 July 2014Production
of all trims and accessories. As well as fabric.
1 - 15 August 2014Sending
all materials to the test laboratory in order to underline and secure our quality standards.
After tests all show pass, we start sending all goods into the sewing line.365 days – almost! We have spent quiet much time now and lots of brainstorming and waiting for the next prototype as well as lots of fun time up to this moment. 
From the first scratch of a single travel backgammon to finally a 4 in 1 game set.
Proudly we can say, we are still alive and happy... due to our supporting friends and family.
In order to bring 2roll to you and the market. We have monetary goals to achieve.
GOAL Indiegogo  = 15.888 USD
This money is necessary in order to produce at least 1 – 2 game colour combinations.
This is our biggest challenge to face - the minimum by colour (1000 pieces) and production MOQs for all items from tokens to fabric to labels and even screen printing. 
We love our fashionable range, but we also understand now, that we need to watch our internal costs. We also understand, why there are only black and white and brown and white games on the market!!! Because who wants to take the risk to make a PINK game...the answer is: US! But therefore we need your support. 
GOAL SALES = 1.000 pcs / game combo
We are ambitious and eager to achieve 1.000 pcs by game combo colour. Then we will not have any leftovers of dices or tokens. 
Therefore any corporate orders of airlines, banks or hotel chains are very welcome! 
But for sure we believe in every single  of „you“ who loves chess or backgammon, checkers or Nine Inch Morris to play while traveling. 
Visit our new launch homepage on www.2roll.com
As with all start-up projects, the main risk is to deliver everything within the estimated timeframe.
We have taken all possible production issues into consideration and planned our schedule accordingly. 
All designs and material parts are finalized, tested and ready for production. If we raise our USD 15.888 target, we should all be right to delivery 2roll by Autumn 2014.
We also feel it's extremely important to make clear that 2roll in it's current format is a limited edition hobbyist product, and that is what supporters will essentially be acquiring through the play set rewards. 
By backing the project you are helping us along with development and design of a better 2roll for the future, while acquiring the current version of the set.",27.0,0,"1 Campaign

</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">One weekend while talking over a beer on some random topics we both realized that alcohol level myths were present in our life on a regular basis, and there wasn't a reliable and easy way to know how alcohol affects our body. And digging around we found that people want to avoid breaking the law, but still want to have just a beer or a cup of wine with a meal. And almost nobody has a clue about the alcohol levels when they drink. So we knew we could do something to solve this, and there started the journey!<br/></p>

<h3>FAQ</h3>
<b>Q: How accurate is it the sensor? </b><br/>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>A: </b>We use a high-precision semiconductor sensor, also the device is designed so you can cup your hand around it and use it as mouthpiece so you can get a more affordable and yet precise device. With that configuration, we have measured great results compared with a professional breathalyzer (+/-0.004% BAC, the limit allowed in the U.S. is 0.08% so you form an idea of the accuracy). Also, we <i>up-compensate</i> the measure on the app so a false negative is way less likely to happen. <br/></p>
<b>Q: Let's talk money, honey. What if you don't reach the goal?</b><br/>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>A: </b>Don't worry a bit, we have a fixed goal. That means you will have a FULL refund if we don't reach the 100%.

That being said, if you backed us you better be sharing the campaign the most you can ;)</p>
<b>Q: How long does the battery last?<br/></b>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>A: </b>Cautoh uses a single AAA Alkaline battery, and it has an autonomy of almost 100 tests with it.</p>
<b>Q: Is it safe to share it?<br/></b>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>A: </b>Most definitely. Cautoh is designed so you never touch the plastic case with your mouth as you blow trough your cupped hand, so feel free to find who's your drunkest friend.</p>
<b>Q: Does Cautoh come with a warranty?<br/></b>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>A: </b>Absolutely!  Every Cautoh will come with a 1-year warranty from any manufacturing faults or defects.</p>
<b>Q: Why do you need Indiegogo for?<br/></b>

A new way to be a smart drinker 

We have been drinking for centuries, and yet we still don't know much about what really happens when we do it. There's technology in every step of our lives, and yet not much when you pour that beer... Cautoh is a portable breathalyzer that uses an advanced alcohol sensor to help you track your alcohol intake and make more responsible drinking choices. With Cautoh, you can see if and when you're ready to drive after a few glasses of wine, avoid pesky hangovers, and remind yourself when enough is enough. Cautoh is small, portable, and discrete. 
Our team has been working hard to take the guesswork out of drinking leaving more room for fun!  And now, a year later, we are proud to present Cautoh - your perfect drinking partner for a night out with friends.

As seen in:




With you since you walk into the bar...

Get a forecast with your drink-buddy, Cautoh. The app will be there from start telling you how will you react in advance to each drink. Do you know that kind of guy that always impress with their use of technology? Well... you can be that guy!




Are you dinning and want a cup of wine?... 

What about a good ale with that steak... While you enjoy that sublime moment Cautoh will got you backed. Enjoy and let the app tell you when you should be sober after that drink!


Support your team, nothing else.

Watching a game with friends tends to get a little crazy sometimes. But that's OK. You can always use Cautoh to know who can drive, or to get an Uber if all resulted too buzzed. 





How does it work




Awesome Features









Really small and portableBeautiful designReally easy to use!                                       Hit the play below! 
 
How is that it doesn't need a mouthpiece? Well, we found out that you can cup your hand around the breathalyzer to form one and still get pretty accurate results. Once you learn how to blow in it you won't hesitate sharing it with your friends. At the end in the FAQ we dig more in the accuracy.
 


But we are not just a breathalyzer

we go a second time. This time it is all about the OS that transforms any of
your devices (PC, MAC, Amiga and Raspberry Pi) into a sort of Steambox. On PC
and Mac we will also provide access to Steam, Desuara and other App-Stores as
well.  </p>
<p>The goal

<p>The
INDIEGO! is about retro, indie and NexGen gaming. Why rebuy your old retro

<p>Based on
our experiences we made with our work around AROS and the creation of AEROS (<a href=""http://www.aeros-os.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>www.aeros-os.org</span></a>). We provide you a single
Operating system which can run your existing Amiga (CD32), AROS, C64, DOS, Mac,
Windows and Linux games. But not only limited to those. </p>
<p>Due to
the open character and the support for Homebrew everyone is invited to add more
support for more platforms and games. </p>
<p>INDIEGO!-OS
will offer a media centric User-Interface (based on our experience with AMC -
Amiga mediaCenter). You can access the INDIEGO!-Marketplace straight from your
sofa. You will find games, demos, movies, music and more for virtually any
gaming system released since digital Stone Age. As long it is legal. </p>
<p>Enjoy
your favorite games from your childhood... play again milestones in gaming
history.  </p>
<p>The
INDIEGO!-Marketplace can also be accessed from Windows, Linux, OSX (PPC and

<p>INDIEGO!
the Video Gaming Console- Operating system funded on indiegogo</p>
<p>Q: Is
this like steamOS? Copycat?</p>
<p>A: No,
just slow developing gives the impression that the others came first : ) Oh and
on ARM devices there is no SteamOS so we fill a gap there. Also not so rich
countries could have fun re-enjoying thousands of games from DOS, AMIGA, C64
era.  </p>
<p>Q: Debian
based? What is the difference to a ""normal"" PC running Ubuntu with a
bunch of emulators?</p>
<p>You get a
easy to use interface which allows to manage, run, buy or freely browse a huge
library</p>
<p>You get a
highly optimized OS which works on PC's with only 500MHZ and 64MR RAM. Ubuntu
who?</p>
<p>And on a
Raspberry Pi... Common... Ubuntu who?</p>
<p>A: We
don't use ""just"" debian as it is. See <a href=""http://www.aeros-os.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>www.aeros-os.org</span></a> and <a href=""http://www.aros.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.aros.org</a> for details. We are running a
mixture of operating systems to have the best from both sides. Compatibility of
Linux and the speed of AROS. Minus the overhead resulting from an normally
bloated Linux environment. </p>
<p>Q: Amiga
Kickstart isn't free, how do you provide compatibility to old consoles?</p>
<p>A: We use
AROS which is an open source reimplementation of AmigaOS 3.1. So it is legal.
During the development Jason McMullan already improved the compatibility to run
ECS/OCS/AGA and CD32 based games. AEROS is a hybrid and run anything a
developer could ask for.</p>
<p>With one
click a developer can make an .igo package of his game for one of the supported
Platforms. </p>
<p>Q: Is my
money lost if I donate and you don't reach the target?</p>
<p>A: No,
you will be automatically be refunded. </p>
<p>This
fundraising is mainly to collect money in advance and to show potential
resellers the public interest. Sure if it would be successful ""money
wise"" it would speed up development. But getting Facebook followers is
nice too. </p>
<p>Q: Will
it have parental controls</p>
<p>A: Fore
sure, that sure hat we didn't thought to announce it : ) Yes of course.</p>
<p>It will
be a multiuser system. Every person in your home will get its own account and
parents can take care about software being allowed. </p>
<p>Q: What
about educational apps?</p>
<p>A: Oh
yes! There are already some educational games available on our App Store. </p>
<p>Q: Can I
use Windows application on a Raspberry Pi running INDIEGO!-OS</p>
<p>A:Yes you
can... you can run some Windows 8 ARM applications when using wine.  But
it is in no way perfect.</p>
<p>Performance
wise the EFIKA MX53 is better suited for i386 emulation.</p>
<p>Q: What if I buy a App using
the Amiga IndieGO!-Client, can I
download it on my PC as well?</p>
<p>A: Yes,
purchases are bound to your user profile. When you log into another machine you
have still access to your paid software. </p>
<p>Q: What
are indieCoins? Something like light coins/bitcoins?</p>
<p>A: No. It
is a kind of bonus system to strengthen our small niche eco-system.</p>
<p><b>Where can i get those indieCoins?</b> You can:</p>
<p>•<span> 
</span><b>get them as a gift</b></p>
<p>•<span> 
</span><b>get them as cash back from partners</b></p>
<p>•<span> 
</span><b>get them from partners in exchange for real money</b></p>
<p>•<span> 
</span><b>you can get them as donation (requires additional membership in a club)</b></p>
<p>•<span> 
</span><b>you can earn them with voluntary jobs</b></p>
<p>Q: Can I
play Steam Games on my Pi? </p>
<p>A: Yes,
but only in combination with a Nvidia powered PC. You can stream them using
limelight.</p><p></p><h3>State of development:</h3><p>We already released a Text based BBS-style client for testing purposes.</p><p>Actually we are in testing phase for the stand alone Clients for Windows, OS X, AROS, AmigaOS, MorphOS and Linux. </p><p>Find the latest Amiga relate News announcement here, giving additional details:</p><p><a href=""http://amigaworld.net/modules/news/article.php?storyid=7085"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://amigaworld.net/modules/news/article.php?storyid=7085</a><br/></p><p>First alpha build running on old Macbook (screen recording in OSX 10.9 became jerky)</p><p> </p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FPi0bRoLzlQQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DPi0bRoLzlQQ&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FPi0bRoLzlQQ%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p></p><p>First alpha on AmigaOS4.x</p><p>Here is another try at 1080p on a SAM733 with a window (borderless).

INDIEGO! was planned as
gaming console but we failed because people told us that they don't
need another PC.. they just asked for the Software.
So here
we go a second time. This time it is all about the OS that transforms any of
your devices (PC, MAC, Amiga and Raspberry Pi) into a sort of Steambox. On PC
and Mac we will also provide access to Steam, Desuara and other App-Stores as
well.  
The goal
is to deliver a custom user interface that was specifically designed for gaming
in living rooms and on large screens.  
The
INDIEGO! is about retro, indie and NexGen gaming. Why rebuy your old retro
games all the time...? Play your originals with INDIEGO!
Based on
our experiences we made with our work around AROS and the creation of AEROS (www.aeros-os.org). We provide you a single
Operating system which can run your existing Amiga (CD32), AROS, C64, DOS, Mac,
Windows and Linux games. But not only limited to those. 
Due to
the open character and the support for Homebrew everyone is invited to add more
support for more platforms and games. 
INDIEGO!-OS
will offer a media centric User-Interface (based on our experience with AMC -
Amiga mediaCenter). You can access the INDIEGO!-Marketplace straight from your
sofa. You will find games, demos, movies, music and more for virtually any
gaming system released since digital Stone Age. As long it is legal. 
Enjoy
your favorite games from your childhood... play again milestones in gaming
history.  
The
INDIEGO!-Marketplace can also be accessed from Windows, Linux, OSX (PPC and
i386), AmigaOS 3.x, AmigaOS 4.x, MorphOS and more. 

We will optimize INDIEGO!-OS for several devices. But thankfully we have
now the trust of Genesi USA and we are proud to bring INDIEGO!-OS(and AEROS) to
the EFIKA MX53 and the Raspberry Pi.
Step
1(already done partially for Raspberry Pi www.aeros-os.org):
AEROS for
EFIKA MX53
incl. 68K emulation for free.
Step 2:
INDIEGO!-Client
for ARM Linux
Step 3:
INDIEGO-OS
for Raspberry Pi and EFIKA MX53
and other devices.
You will
be able to access your games from AEROS with a Client (window-mode or full
screen) or you login straight into INDIEGO!-OS ideal for big TV's.
EFIKA
MX53 brings enough performance to emulate faster Amigas.
A PI
reaches roughly A500 speed. The Efika will allow emulation of A1200 - we will
check this and report back! 
When we reach the final stretch goal we will release also AEROS including
the lx-command for free on all named Platforms. 
So far
there is a free version and a ""Plus"" version available that offer
extended features. 

INDIEGO-OS WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR FREE anyway!!! 
Compatible devices will be called INDIEGO!-certified. 
One of those
IndieGO!-/Steam/boxes is the AresOne 2014.
To make things affordable for everyone we will switch focus on small,
efficient ARM devices as the Raspberry Pi and the Efika MX53.
You can even transform a sub 30$ Net client into a retro console with
access of thousand or more hours of entertainment. Mostly for free.
The EFIKA MX53 platform
creates a solid foundation for consumer and embedded products, including
netbooks, tablets 
INDIEGO-Marketplace
will be full of free software, an ideal platform for not so rich people. As you

Kickstart isn't free, how do you provide compatibility to old consoles?
A: We use
AROS which is an open source reimplementation of AmigaOS 3.1. So it is legal.
During the development Jason McMullan already improved the compatibility to run
ECS/OCS/AGA and CD32 based games. AEROS is a hybrid and run anything a
developer could ask for.
With one
click a developer can make an .igo package of his game for one of the supported
Platforms. 
Q: Is my
money lost if I donate and you don't reach the target?
A: No,
you will be automatically be refunded. 
This
fundraising is mainly to collect money in advance and to show potential
resellers the public interest. Sure if it would be successful ""money
wise"" it would speed up development. But getting Facebook followers is
nice too. 
Q: Will
it have parental controls
A: Fore
sure, that sure hat we didn't thought to announce it : ) Yes of course.
It will
be a multiuser system. Every person in your home will get its own account and
parents can take care about software being allowed. 
Q: What
about educational apps?
A: Oh
yes! There are already some educational games available on our App Store. 
Q: Can I
use Windows application on a Raspberry Pi running INDIEGO!-OS
A:Yes you
can... you can run some Windows 8 ARM applications when using wine.  But
it is in no way perfect.
Performance
wise the EFIKA MX53 is better suited for i386 emulation.
Q: What if I buy a App using
the Amiga IndieGO!-Client, can I
download it on my PC as well?
A: Yes,
purchases are bound to your user profile. When you log into another machine you
have still access to your paid software. 
Q: What
are indieCoins? Something like light coins/bitcoins?
A: No. It
is a kind of bonus system to strengthen our small niche eco-system.
Where can i get those indieCoins? You can:
• 
get them as a gift
• 
get them as cash back from partners
• 
get them from partners in exchange for real money
• 
you can get them as donation (requires additional membership in a club)
• 
you can earn them with voluntary jobs
Q: Can I
play Steam Games on my Pi? 
A: Yes,
but only in combination with a Nvidia powered PC. You can stream them using
limelight.State of development:We already released a Text based BBS-style client for testing purposes.Actually we are in testing phase for the stand alone Clients for Windows, OS X, AROS, AmigaOS, MorphOS and Linux. Find the latest Amiga relate News announcement here, giving additional details:http://amigaworld.net/modules/news/article.php?storyid=7085First alpha build running on old Macbook (screen recording in OSX 10.9 became jerky) First alpha on AmigaOS4.xHere is another try at 1080p on a SAM733 with a window (borderless). With all effects ""on"" as previously shown:Pandora XXL anyone ? ; ) Here is the same running on a 667MHZ EEEPC and Broadway EEEPC Edition:We are still optimizing and we will show a new version for lowend-machines in a few days.Our targets (and stretch goals):First target is a small one:Creating a version of AEROS for EfikaMX53 and a INDIEGO!- Client for which works on existing ARM Linux distributions. Enhancing server api to allow user reviews and more.

<b>How did this all start?</b><p></p>
<p>So I am a flight instructor who was born in Australia but I've been living in the U.S. for the last 20 years. I have been flying for about 10 years and ever since I started I could never understand why all the small planes were so small. Why can't they be spacious like a car? Over the years I have researched many planes but I couldn't seem to find one that had everything I was looking for in a plane. So a few months ago I decided I would design my own with no initial intention of where that might lead.</p>
<p>The first requirement was that it was roomy, like a mid size sedan or SUV with around 62"" across at the pilot shoulders. I wanted to feel comfortable because I really like to do cross country travelling where you might be spending 4 hours on board. So I started with a virtual box which would outline the cabin space comfortable for 6'2"" passengers and proceeded to create an aircraft around those dimensions. </p>
<p>The next requirement was it had to look cool. Most planes are ugly and you have to paint stripes on them just to attempt to make them look exciting. I wanted my plane to be sleek and sexy (no stripes necessary). So I started with a sleek shape. I wanted the windows to have the a wrap around effect, like my plane was wearing a cool pair of shades. I also wanted this effect without tricking anyone using paint. I knew it would be difficult, but possible, to construct a frameless window.</p>
<p>Next I wanted a canard design because inherently they are faster than a conventional tractor design. They call it a tractor because it's slow like a tractor :^P. In a tractor design the horizontal tail must generate downforce to keep the aircraft stable because the center of lift from the main wing is behind the center of mass. In any aircraft you need to be developing lift overall so creating downforce anywhere on the airframe seems like a waste of energy. A canard design has the center of mass between the main and fore wings and so both are generating lift to keep it stable. This is a much more efficient design. Also with a canard design the forward wing or fore plane is at a higher angle of attack and therefore will stall before the main wing. When this happens the nose simply drops a little and the fore plane begins flying again. Therefore it's not possible to stall the main wing. If the main wing can't stall then there is no way to spin a canard design and therefore they are safer. No ballistic parachute required.</p>
<p>Then I decided that I wanted to reduce drag wherever possible and go for a cruising speed at altitude of 300 knots true. At 25K feet this equates to 200 knots indicated. That's about 345mph or 556kph across the ground. Now we're going places! The sleekest airframes are composite construction (no rivets) so composite was the way to go. Obviously I would want to be able to pressurize it if I was going to be flying that high and composite construction also provides the strength required.</p>
<p>Next on the list was visibility. Most of the planes I have flown have the engine out the front and a high (too high) glare shield so the visibility out the front is nothing short of horrible. I wanted it to be like my car where I can see everything and the hood or dash are nowhere near my line of sight. For example, in a Cessna 182 the top of the glare shield is only 1 inch below my horizontal line of sight. I cant even imagine how someone shorter could fly that plane without sitting on a couple of phone books. Anyway, in my design the top of the glare shield is 6 inches below my line of sight, even lower on the passenger side. Not only that, the seats slide on an incline so shorter passengers will sit higher when they slide their seat forward. For a change your spouse will be able to see out the front and will enjoy flying even more.</p>
<p>The next consideration was how it would be powered. Most light aircraft use piston engines that burn 100 octane low lead fuel. This fuel is more expensive than other fuels and becoming even more so as it is considered a specialty fuel by the oil companies and eventually it will be phased out much like leaded auto fuel was. Diesel engines in aircraft are becoming available but they are heavy and require a lot of air for cooling. That air requirement creates drag. Recall that I am going for low drag. The ideal engine was a small turboprop. They burn jet fuel which is readily available (and will be for decades) and is cheaper than 100LL. So I did some research and found the Allison (now Rolls Royce owned) M250 series engines. They have been around since the 60's and are a reliable engine with a fuel burn of about 21 gallons an hour at altitude. So let's see, 345mph @ 21 gph works out to about 16 miles per gallon. Not bad considering you'll be taking 4 or 5 almost anywhere in no time. This is cheaper than driving if you factor in hotel overnight stays that are inevitable on longer trips. </p>
<p>OK, so that was the plan. Now the question remained, would I be able to design such an aircraft. I decided to try and just see what happened.</p>
<p>So as you can see below it turns out I can. Before you check out all the details let me finish the story. About 2 months into the design I figured it was a viable proposition so I decided to take a trip to Florida to visit a composite construction company that uses 5-axis CNC milling machines to make pieces and ultimately molds from a design like I have done. Everything was cool there and they can quite easily create the initial parts and then molds from those pieces. Using those molds, pieces can be created again and again. At this point I figured that it would be selfish of me to create only one of these planes so let's make molds and allow others to create the plane as well.</p>
<p>So the next step was to find someone to help me build it once the molds are ready. So I headed off to a composite shop, also in Florida, and after spending a day there and learning a lot I got on the web and did some more research and came across the website of a guy named Jeff Kerlo who had already designed, built and flown his own canard aircraft a few years earlier. My immediate thought was 'this is the guy I need to talk to'. So I gave him a call and an our later he called me back and we talked for about 3 hours. I showed him my design via the web page that I had created a week earlier and he was excited about it. Turns out he's back in Atlanta so the next morning I'm in the car headed North. I met with Jeff and he *IS* the guy and not only that, he wants to partner with me and create a company from this design. Turns out he planned to do the same thing with his aircraft but it did not work out for various reasons that are too detailed to go into here. Anyway, he already had figured out a 4 week in house initial build process and setting up a facility and tooling in Atlanta. So it seems like we were destined to meet and tackle this project.</p>
<p>So I spent a full day talking with Jeff and he gave me loads of ideas for changes and improvements to the design. Since then I have spent the last 4 weeks making all the changes and what you see below is the result of all that. </p>
<p>So now here we are, trying to raise the money to get started via Indiegogo. We think this design can really change what a small aircraft should be like but we need your help to prove this to the world. The question remains... will enough people think this is cool enough to want to be a part of it? We shall see. Thanks for reading my story.</p>

<p><span class=""notranlsate""></span></p>
<p>Although first discovered by a German, in the 50's a bright NACA engineer independently discovered the Area Rule and it was later used on the F102. Before the changes suggested by the Area Rule the aircraft was not able to go supersonic and afterwards it readily made Mach 1.2. All they did was modify the fuselage to have a coke bottle shape where the main wing was. That's a performance gain of close to 30%. </p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/171040/files/20131102114018-f102-1.jpg?1383417618"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Here you can see the improvements that were made to the F102.

<p>As you can see from the chart above that overlays the cross sectional area over the airframe profile, the design of the Raptor results in almost a perfect area rule distribution. This means that instead of having pressure fluctuations as the air moves around the aircraft the pressure instead increases smoothly and decreases smoothly.

<p>With a conventional tractor design there is a big jump in cross sectional area where the cockpit and wing begin and likewise a large drop where they end.

This new design virtually eliminates this problem.</p>

<p>Compare the area Rule distribution of the Raptor with this one of the Cirrus SR22. As you can see there is an obvious problem with this design. The widest part of the cockpit is in the same longitudinal position as the wing. This results in a maximum cross sectional area that is 33% larger (160 vs. 120 in the chart) than the Raptor. So even though the Raptor has a wider cabin than the SR22 it's maximum cross sectional area is way less, meaning it can squeeze through the air without having to displace as much air as what the SR22 does. This makes for a much faster and more efficient design.</p>

<p>All customers will come to our build facility to be located in Atlanta, GA to spend the first 4 weeks under supervision while they build their airframe. At the end of that period the airframe will be complete. You can then take it home or complete it at our facility. It will be up on the gear and all composite work will be complete. Engine, avionics, interior and paint will remain to be completed on your own schedule.</p>
<p>All parts will be created from molds prior to you beginning construction of your airframe. This way you will see immediate progress from day one. This new approach to construction means that you can have your plane done in half the time of traditional composite construction methods that instead require a great deal of custom fabrication.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/170742/files/20131102091621-detail_view.jpg?1383408981"" src="""" style=""""/>All of the parts will either be molded or CNC cut virtually eliminating the need for the builder to fabricate anything.</p>

All of the parts have been flanged and where indenting is not possible or practical we will have a jig for accurately locating each part.</p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>Engine Options</b></span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/171129/files/20131102121424-M250.png?1383419664"" src="""" style=""""/></p>The aircraft was designed to accept an Allison/Rolls Royce M250 turboprop that produces 420-650 hp but it could it just as easily be fitted with a Pratt and Whitney or Walter engine or a piston engine that provided at least 260 hp. In the future it could also use an electric powerplant if one becomes available. Note that the Allison engine only weighs just over 200 lbs. The weight saving over other engine options comes back to you as increased useful load. For example, if you decide to install a TSIO550 instead, you lose 350 lbs of useful load due to the increased engine weight. <p></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">As for the Allison engine there are many variations and depending on availability we may look into setting up a channel where we can convert those used in Bell helicopters from the turboshaft configuration to a turboprop. These engines should come in at around $100K reconditioned. The design has been around for over 50 years. Their TBO is over 3500 hours and they are extremely reliable and efficient and are the perfect fit for this project.</span></p>
<p><b>Performance</b></p>
<p>With the Allison engine it should climb at least 3000 fpm and max cruise at 300 KTAS at FL250 while burning 21 gph. With a 260 hp engine it should cruise at 200 KTAS on 12 gph. Fuel capacity is 52.3 in each wing and 28.9 gals in the sump tank behind the rear seats. The total of 133.5 gals should provide a range of 1600nm with IFR reserves.</p>
<p><b>Design Advantages and Safety</b></p>
<p>A canard aircraft such as this has many advantages over a conventional design. Note that the Wright brothers original aircraft was a pusher canard design. They had the right idea from the start but somehow the tractor(slow) design became more popular. A canard aircraft will not stall and therefore will not spin. In fact you can hold the stick all the way back and the aircraft will gently rock while you maintain full aileron control. This means there is no real need for a ballistic parachute because with the stick all the way back the airplane will sink with a rate not much faster than with a parachute. </p>
<p>Another huge advantage for a canard is that both surfaces are generating lift whereas on a tractor design the tail is generating down force which is simply a waste. On any aircraft the faster you go the more you have to trim the plane nose down because the surfaces generate more lift that you no longer need when simply trying to maintain altitude. On a tractor design this nose down attitude actually increases the angle of attack on the horizontal tail and it generates more down force that must ultimately be negated by the elevator being trimmed down. That combination creates even more drag. On a canard both surfaces reduce lift as the attitude goes nose down and less lift means less drag. Simply put, canards are more efficient and therefore faster and more efficient than a tractor design.</p>
<p>Having the engine in the back improves forward visibility and provides for safety in case of an oil leak or engine fire. You can also safely have passengers enter and exit the aircraft while the prop is turning without worrying too much about them getting close to the prop. </p>
<p>The prop in the back also eliminates the need for right rudder on climb out. Also, the noise is behind you making for a quieter cabin.</p>
<p><b>Other Options</b></p>
<p>The cabin will be pressurized providing superior comfort for you and your passengers. The glass will be 5/8"" Lexan providing not only for safety in the case of a bird strike but also durability. </p>
<p>If the demand is there, a fixed gear option will also be available. This would involve locking pins on the retractable gear that could be removed at a later date if the option to switch back to retractable was required.</p>
<p><b>Pricing</b></p>
<p>The kit will most likely be priced at $80K and provide everything except, engine, avionics, paint and interior finish. All interior panels will be included and will just need to be covered. Allison engines are available reconditioned for around $100K and we will be making efforts to get a ready supply of them at reasonable prices. You should expect to spend about $250K total for a turboprop version or $190K total for a piston version.</p>
<p><b>Construction</b></p>
<p>Given that all the parts will already be cut and no major fabrication is required the build time should be as low as 500 hours, perhaps even less. It will be very similar to building an aircraft model from a set of pre-molded plastic parts, more assembly than fabrication.</p>
<p><b>Where are we at now</b></p>
<p>The design phase is about 98% complete. At this point the funding needs to be secured. As soon as funding is confirmed a reservation will be made for the molds to be constructed. Molds could be ready as soon as late March and the first prototype aircraft construction will begin immediately.</p>
<p><b>Where does your contribution go</b></p>
<p>Your contribution will initially pay for the molds to be constructed by a professional shop that uses 5 axis CNC machines to mill a plug version of each part. They then create a mold from that part. The molds will then be transported to the build center and the first set of parts will be created. Assembly will begin. An engine will be procured and fitted. Avionics, electrical, interior and paint will be completed and the aircraft will have it's initial 40 hours flown. At that time the barnstorming tour will be planned and all contribution rides fulfilled in a timely manner. Kit's will become available soon after the first flight.</p>
<p><b>Where do we go from there</b></p>
<p>Hopefully there are other people out there that find this aircraft design exciting and want to build their own. If that's the case, kits will be available as well as support and help to get each of them flying as quickly and safely as possible. </p>

<p></p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","How did this all start?
So I am a flight instructor who was born in Australia but I've been living in the U.S. for the last 20 years. I have been flying for about 10 years and ever since I started I could never understand why all the small planes were so small. Why can't they be spacious like a car? Over the years I have researched many planes but I couldn't seem to find one that had everything I was looking for in a plane. So a few months ago I decided I would design my own with no initial intention of where that might lead.
The first requirement was that it was roomy, like a mid size sedan or SUV with around 62"" across at the pilot shoulders. I wanted to feel comfortable because I really like to do cross country travelling where you might be spending 4 hours on board. So I started with a virtual box which would outline the cabin space comfortable for 6'2"" passengers and proceeded to create an aircraft around those dimensions. 
The next requirement was it had to look cool. Most planes are ugly and you have to paint stripes on them just to attempt to make them look exciting. I wanted my plane to be sleek and sexy (no stripes necessary). So I started with a sleek shape. I wanted the windows to have the a wrap around effect, like my plane was wearing a cool pair of shades. I also wanted this effect without tricking anyone using paint. I knew it would be difficult, but possible, to construct a frameless window.
Next I wanted a canard design because inherently they are faster than a conventional tractor design. They call it a tractor because it's slow like a tractor :^P. In a tractor design the horizontal tail must generate downforce to keep the aircraft stable because the center of lift from the main wing is behind the center of mass. In any aircraft you need to be developing lift overall so creating downforce anywhere on the airframe seems like a waste of energy. A canard design has the center of mass between the main and fore wings and so both are generating lift to keep it stable. This is a much more efficient design. Also with a canard design the forward wing or fore plane is at a higher angle of attack and therefore will stall before the main wing. When this happens the nose simply drops a little and the fore plane begins flying again. Therefore it's not possible to stall the main wing. If the main wing can't stall then there is no way to spin a canard design and therefore they are safer. No ballistic parachute required.
Then I decided that I wanted to reduce drag wherever possible and go for a cruising speed at altitude of 300 knots true. At 25K feet this equates to 200 knots indicated. That's about 345mph or 556kph across the ground. Now we're going places! The sleekest airframes are composite construction (no rivets) so composite was the way to go. Obviously I would want to be able to pressurize it if I was going to be flying that high and composite construction also provides the strength required.
Next on the list was visibility. Most of the planes I have flown have the engine out the front and a high (too high) glare shield so the visibility out the front is nothing short of horrible. I wanted it to be like my car where I can see everything and the hood or dash are nowhere near my line of sight. For example, in a Cessna 182 the top of the glare shield is only 1 inch below my horizontal line of sight. I cant even imagine how someone shorter could fly that plane without sitting on a couple of phone books. Anyway, in my design the top of the glare shield is 6 inches below my line of sight, even lower on the passenger side. Not only that, the seats slide on an incline so shorter passengers will sit higher when they slide their seat forward. For a change your spouse will be able to see out the front and will enjoy flying even more.
The next consideration was how it would be powered. Most light aircraft use piston engines that burn 100 octane low lead fuel. This fuel is more expensive than other fuels and becoming even more so as it is considered a specialty fuel by the oil companies and eventually it will be phased out much like leaded auto fuel was. Diesel engines in aircraft are becoming available but they are heavy and require a lot of air for cooling. That air requirement creates drag. Recall that I am going for low drag. The ideal engine was a small turboprop. They burn jet fuel which is readily available (and will be for decades) and is cheaper than 100LL. So I did some research and found the Allison (now Rolls Royce owned) M250 series engines. They have been around since the 60's and are a reliable engine with a fuel burn of about 21 gallons an hour at altitude. So let's see, 345mph @ 21 gph works out to about 16 miles per gallon. Not bad considering you'll be taking 4 or 5 almost anywhere in no time. This is cheaper than driving if you factor in hotel overnight stays that are inevitable on longer trips. 
OK, so that was the plan. Now the question remained, would I be able to design such an aircraft. I decided to try and just see what happened.
So as you can see below it turns out I can. Before you check out all the details let me finish the story. About 2 months into the design I figured it was a viable proposition so I decided to take a trip to Florida to visit a composite construction company that uses 5-axis CNC milling machines to make pieces and ultimately molds from a design like I have done. Everything was cool there and they can quite easily create the initial parts and then molds from those pieces. Using those molds, pieces can be created again and again. At this point I figured that it would be selfish of me to create only one of these planes so let's make molds and allow others to create the plane as well.
So the next step was to find someone to help me build it once the molds are ready. So I headed off to a composite shop, also in Florida, and after spending a day there and learning a lot I got on the web and did some more research and came across the website of a guy named Jeff Kerlo who had already designed, built and flown his own canard aircraft a few years earlier. My immediate thought was 'this is the guy I need to talk to'. So I gave him a call and an our later he called me back and we talked for about 3 hours. I showed him my design via the web page that I had created a week earlier and he was excited about it. Turns out he's back in Atlanta so the next morning I'm in the car headed North. I met with Jeff and he *IS* the guy and not only that, he wants to partner with me and create a company from this design. Turns out he planned to do the same thing with his aircraft but it did not work out for various reasons that are too detailed to go into here. Anyway, he already had figured out a 4 week in house initial build process and setting up a facility and tooling in Atlanta. So it seems like we were destined to meet and tackle this project.
So I spent a full day talking with Jeff and he gave me loads of ideas for changes and improvements to the design. Since then I have spent the last 4 weeks making all the changes and what you see below is the result of all that. 
So now here we are, trying to raise the money to get started via Indiegogo. We think this design can really change what a small aircraft should be like but we need your help to prove this to the world. The question remains... will enough people think this is cool enough to want to be a part of it? We shall see. Thanks for reading my story.

Design Analysis and Drag Reduction
I have done a lot of flow modeling to ensure that the design does not create any unwanted disturbances that can result in dreaded drag.

This plot shows the vorticity or turbulence. I would still like to clean up the intake a bit but it was considerably worse on my first design.


Background coloring shows how the cabin shape accelerates the air thereby creating lift. The colors on the airframe show the relative air pressure distribution.

Background colors show surrounding air pressure and airframe colors show shear stress levels.
This plot shows air density distribution.

Area Rule Analysis of Airframe when compared with other designs

Although first discovered by a German, in the 50's a bright NACA engineer independently discovered the Area Rule and it was later used on the F102. Before the changes suggested by the Area Rule the aircraft was not able to go supersonic and afterwards it readily made Mach 1.2. All they did was modify the fuselage to have a coke bottle shape where the main wing was. That's a performance gain of close to 30%. 

Here you can see the improvements that were made to the F102. Note that the cross sectional plot was improved but was still not ideal.

The cross sectional area transition smoothness that was achieved with the Raptor design is beyond what they achieved back then and will result in a major drag reduction, improved performance and greater efficiency.

The area rule plot shows that pressure changes are almost perfectly smooth as air flows from nose to tail. This design is a huge improvement over traditional tractor configurations. Compare this smooth bell curve with the plot from the Cirrus SR22 below.

As you can see from the chart above that overlays the cross sectional area over the airframe profile, the design of the Raptor results in almost a perfect area rule distribution. This means that instead of having pressure fluctuations as the air moves around the aircraft the pressure instead increases smoothly and decreases smoothly. This minimizes any turbulence and further reduces drag. 
With a conventional tractor design there is a big jump in cross sectional area where the cockpit and wing begin and likewise a large drop where they end. Then you have another increase and decrease on the tail section, These abrupt cross sectional area increases and decreases on conventional aircraft create large pressure fluctuations which disrupt air flow creating turbulence and therefore create a lot of drag. This new design virtually eliminates this problem.

As you can see here the pressure fluctuations over the airframe of the Cirrus are dramatic. These cause turbulence and ultimately drag. It's called a 'tractor' configuration for a reason... tractors are SLOW.
Compare the area Rule distribution of the Raptor with this one of the Cirrus SR22. As you can see there is an obvious problem with this design. The widest part of the cockpit is in the same longitudinal position as the wing. This results in a maximum cross sectional area that is 33% larger (160 vs. 120 in the chart) than the Raptor. So even though the Raptor has a wider cabin than the SR22 it's maximum cross sectional area is way less, meaning it can squeeze through the air without having to displace as much air as what the SR22 does. This makes for a much faster and more efficient design.
You can read more about the Area Rule here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_rule.
Cabin Space

The Raptor has, by far, more interior cabin space than any GA aircraft. The cabin is 62"" across at both the pilot and back seat passenger shoulders. Compare that with only 49"" for the Cirrus (even less in the back). Even a KingAir only has 54"" of cabin width. Not only that but the back seats of the Raptor have just as much leg room as business class on an airline. The seats are cantilever suspended on carbon fiber braces allowing you to place your feet or bags underneath without the hassle of seat leg posts. This is truly state of the art design and ergonomics.

As you can see here there is as much space as your regular SUV. This pic shows the 4 seat option but you could just as easily install a bench seat in the back and carry 5 people.
There's no need risk falling by having to climb up on the wing to enter this aircraft. Just slide on in. The seat is at 32"" which is higher than a car seat but lower than an SUV making it the perfect height for everyone to easily get in and out. The doors are 48"" wide allowing easy access to the back seats.


As you can see from this cross section there is loads of space. These passengers are 6' tall. Notice the knee room for the rear passenger.

If we take the roof off (and part of one guy's head. ouch!) you can see again how much space there is. There's enough room for the back seat passengers to place their luggage on the floor next to them.
Of course if you wanted to put 3 across seating in the back the width at shoulder level is 61"". That's definitely a comfy back seat for the kids.
There's also plenty of head room for even the tallest person. The seats slide on an incline and so as the seat moves forward it comes up. With the increased visibility of not having the engine out front even the shortest pilot will have a great view out front. The rudder pedal position will be adjustable so whether you're 5' or 6'5"" the aircraft will feel like it was made just for you.

Side sticks allow precise and comfortable aircraft control while not blocking your view of the panel.

The instrument panel is designed to tilt back for easy access when installing or maintaining the avionics.

A great view for the pilot with the glare shield not blocking the view out the front yet everything on the panel is still readily visible. Note that the camera angle is somewhat tilted down for this view. The top of the glare shield is about 6"" below your horizontal line of sight.

Copilot also gets a great view and will have an optional pop-up instrument or iPad panel that retracts to be hidden in the dash.

Even the back seat passengers get a great view out the front.

Specifications

Wingspan is just under 32' 9"", length is just under 20' 7"".

Excellent visibility for pilots and passengers. The rear seats are slightly higher and offset to the center.

Exhaust configuration for turboprop can also be used for piston option.
A single large intake where the airflow is the fastest provides for all the air requirements. This also reduces drag by not having multiple inlets and outlets.
The air intake will be channeled to provide intake air for the turboprop as well as cabin air. For the piston option it provides intake, cooling and cabin air. In the piston option the spinner diameter will be reduced to allow cooling air to escape. We are still in the process of designing a variable intake opening so just the right amount of air can be taken in.


Build Process
All customers will come to our build facility to be located in Atlanta, GA to spend the first 4 weeks under supervision while they build their airframe. At the end of that period the airframe will be complete. You can then take it home or complete it at our facility. It will be up on the gear and all composite work will be complete. Engine, avionics, interior and paint will remain to be completed on your own schedule.
All parts will be created from molds prior to you beginning construction of your airframe. This way you will see immediate progress from day one. This new approach to construction means that you can have your plane done in half the time of traditional composite construction methods that instead require a great deal of custom fabrication.

All of the parts will either be molded or CNC cut virtually eliminating the need for the builder to fabricate anything.

An example of how a wing rib will look ready for installation into the spar and wing.
Given the precision of CNC of machining, all of the parts will fit together with ease thereby reducing build time and ensuring that your aircraft has the highest quality possible for a home-built. All of the parts have been flanged and where indenting is not possible or practical we will have a jig for accurately locating each part.
Engine Options

The aircraft was designed to accept an Allison/Rolls Royce M250 turboprop that produces 420-650 hp but it could it just as easily be fitted with a Pratt and Whitney or Walter engine or a piston engine that provided at least 260 hp. In the future it could also use an electric powerplant if one becomes available. Note that the Allison engine only weighs just over 200 lbs. The weight saving over other engine options comes back to you as increased useful load. For example, if you decide to install a TSIO550 instead, you lose 350 lbs of useful load due to the increased engine weight. 
As for the Allison engine there are many variations and depending on availability we may look into setting up a channel where we can convert those used in Bell helicopters from the turboshaft configuration to a turboprop. These engines should come in at around $100K reconditioned. The design has been around for over 50 years. Their TBO is over 3500 hours and they are extremely reliable and efficient and are the perfect fit for this project.
Performance
With the Allison engine it should climb at least 3000 fpm and max cruise at 300 KTAS at FL250 while burning 21 gph. With a 260 hp engine it should cruise at 200 KTAS on 12 gph. Fuel capacity is 52.3 in each wing and 28.9 gals in the sump tank behind the rear seats. The total of 133.5 gals should provide a range of 1600nm with IFR reserves.
Design Advantages and Safety
A canard aircraft such as this has many advantages over a conventional design. Note that the Wright brothers original aircraft was a pusher canard design. They had the right idea from the start but somehow the tractor(slow) design became more popular. A canard aircraft will not stall and therefore will not spin. In fact you can hold the stick all the way back and the aircraft will gently rock while you maintain full aileron control. This means there is no real need for a ballistic parachute because with the stick all the way back the airplane will sink with a rate not much faster than with a parachute. 
Another huge advantage for a canard is that both surfaces are generating lift whereas on a tractor design the tail is generating down force which is simply a waste. On any aircraft the faster you go the more you have to trim the plane nose down because the surfaces generate more lift that you no longer need when simply trying to maintain altitude. On a tractor design this nose down attitude actually increases the angle of attack on the horizontal tail and it generates more down force that must ultimately be negated by the elevator being trimmed down. That combination creates even more drag. On a canard both surfaces reduce lift as the attitude goes nose down and less lift means less drag. Simply put, canards are more efficient and therefore faster and more efficient than a tractor design.
Having the engine in the back improves forward visibility and provides for safety in case of an oil leak or engine fire. You can also safely have passengers enter and exit the aircraft while the prop is turning without worrying too much about them getting close to the prop. 
The prop in the back also eliminates the need for right rudder on climb out. Also, the noise is behind you making for a quieter cabin.
Other Options
The cabin will be pressurized providing superior comfort for you and your passengers. The glass will be 5/8"" Lexan providing not only for safety in the case of a bird strike but also durability. 
If the demand is there, a fixed gear option will also be available. This would involve locking pins on the retractable gear that could be removed at a later date if the option to switch back to retractable was required.
Pricing
The kit will most likely be priced at $80K and provide everything except, engine, avionics, paint and interior finish. All interior panels will be included and will just need to be covered. Allison engines are available reconditioned for around $100K and we will be making efforts to get a ready supply of them at reasonable prices. You should expect to spend about $250K total for a turboprop version or $190K total for a piston version.
Construction
Given that all the parts will already be cut and no major fabrication is required the build time should be as low as 500 hours, perhaps even less. It will be very similar to building an aircraft model from a set of pre-molded plastic parts, more assembly than fabrication.
Where are we at now
The design phase is about 98% complete. At this point the funding needs to be secured. As soon as funding is confirmed a reservation will be made for the molds to be constructed. Molds could be ready as soon as late March and the first prototype aircraft construction will begin immediately.
Where does your contribution go
Your contribution will initially pay for the molds to be constructed by a professional shop that uses 5 axis CNC machines to mill a plug version of each part. They then create a mold from that part. The molds will then be transported to the build center and the first set of parts will be created. Assembly will begin. An engine will be procured and fitted. Avionics, electrical, interior and paint will be completed and the aircraft will have it's initial 40 hours flown. At that time the barnstorming tour will be planned and all contribution rides fulfilled in a timely manner. Kit's will become available soon after the first flight.
Where do we go from there
Hopefully there are other people out there that find this aircraft design exciting and want to build their own. If that's the case, kits will be available as well as support and help to get each of them flying as quickly and safely as possible. 
Please spread the word of this project to all of your friends. Your help is greatly appreciated.




Colors other than white will be possible. Please see our website for other examples.

It's free!iOS version will be implemented right after the campaign and will be delivered with the product. Why?Well, after some years of flying giant scale planes on numerous airfields, I found that current power supply box were not that easy to setup and that there was a lack of features:
I had to remove the canopy to see the vital informations,
I was unable to setup a correct servo matching on the overall throw.
I needed a 2 meters (6 ft) long arm to press the setting buttons while looking at the elevators.
Servo sequencers were hard to setup.
I had to unplug all servos to find that the one I was looking for was the last one.
The overall user interface was, let's say... a bit old school at a time when every device is connected.
For these reasons, I decided to put my experience as software engineer (and 3 years in professinal UAV development) in this project: Building the easiest to use and most powerfull box ever.Where are we?Today, several prototypes are fliying every day. There are used, of course as the last validation stage but also to gather maximum user feedback to adjust the app to the real world needs. A new generation of power supplySafetyEven if you have the best user interface, you're nothing without safety.Internal monitoringSticksGuru features four onboard voltage regulations for various uses (servos, receivers, processor). Each of them is redundant and continuously monitored by the device. If any half regulation fails for any reason, you'll be warned by telemetry or buzzer and be able to service the device before the other half dies.SticksGuru also monitors internal temperature.Overcurrent protectionSticksGuru features overcurrent protection on all outputs. That means that if a shortcircuit happens on an external component (servo for example), This component will be deactivated and the device will still run.Buzzer, telemetry, notificationsAny alarm or request for action is reported through sound alarm and telemetry. Get detailed information about it by checking notifications on your phone. On old systems, you had to check if everything is all right. We think that this approach is failure prone. We prefered to push the information to the user as soon as possible (before or after flying with the buzzer or during flight with telemetry). PowerSticksGuru runs a 32 bits ARM Cortex-M3 microcontroler. It's the fastest box on the planet! Safe start-upAll informations required for start-up are clearly available: Batteries remaining capacity, batteries voltage, receivers status. Named inputs       
Replace channel Id by a comprehensive name
Names are used in all the software.
        One second outputs affectation
Use a comprehensive servo name instead of outputId
Auto suggestion of servo name.
Frame rate from 6 to 21 ms.
 Advanced servo matching
Match your servos using 3 to 13 points curves without using your transmitter

2 sets of curves for each output switched on an external channel. It's ideal for two differents kinematics on the same control surrface (pattern / freestyle).
Easy set-up using accessory functions: neutral, all neutral, interpolate, copy, paste, temporary deactivation of an output...
More power, less consumption, less servo and frame usuaries.

<p><b>Why  bother with car amplifier while there is the original audio system ?</b></p>
<p>--The original ones are usually  not satisfying, totally not
acceptable if you're music enthusiast like us.Talking about upgrading, Raising
the soundstage and enhancing the detail in every song at any volume, you
must be thinking about those very expensive upgrading devices including an
amplifier and several speakers, subwoofers.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Now let's get to know carmuse with several questions:</p>
<p><b>1. How did you get tuned with traditional car amplifier?</b></p>
<p>--Go to a car shop, find professional
ones, get a computer, and get tuned once,</p>
<p>later when you want to tune a song, take
your computer and get tuned by yourself.</p><p><b style=""background-color: initial;"">And with Carmuse amplifier?</b></p>

DSP?</b></p>
<p>The digital sound processor strips away the
sound-shaping limitations enforced by your factory stereo and sends a clean

<p>Carmuse is a 4 channel amplifier with 50w
wattage output wattage for each channel, so does it mean it could only drive
speakers of 50 wattage? Nope!</p>
<p>We have tested for
many times and the result proves that it could drive speakers up to 100w due to
its conversion rate as we’re getting power from head unit .Unlike getting power
from the battery , it doesn’t supply power for other uses like navigator etc and
focus on supplying power for amplifier to drive speakers, it is the part our
engineers is proud of after many days of hardwork.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1467870009/10_yb21qc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>So what more could you ask for?<div><b>6.

--The original ones are usually  not satisfying, totally not
acceptable if you're music enthusiast like us.Talking about upgrading, Raising
the soundstage and enhancing the detail in every song at any volume, you
must be thinking about those very expensive upgrading devices including an
amplifier and several speakers, subwoofers.
And you also paid for services like installation and tuning.
We love getting things done by ourselves! what about you? without going to
car shop and complicated installation, We made Carmuse amplifier so easy
to install and get tuned with professional but intuitive app which will utterly
thrill music enthusiasts, get your car audio upgrading done by yourself with
simple and cheap way, Take Carmuse amplifier with you to enjoy quite  a
trip!

Now let's get to know carmuse with several questions:
1. How did you get tuned with traditional car amplifier?
--Go to a car shop, find professional
ones, get a computer, and get tuned once,
later when you want to tune a song, take
your computer and get tuned by yourself.And with Carmuse amplifier?
--simply with a move of the finger on
the app of your smartphone screen!

And we moved all the operation on computer to the screen and visualized
the tuning process!

Through the app , you have options.  Switch between different sound channels, control volume output, name your own personal tuning preferences, enjoy phase control to set up for subwoofer installation and best of all locate the balanced area for sound.  It will even divide up different styles of music. And if you are the same car type with your friend, you could even share the tuned setup with him. Let's start a competition of who can get the same song tuned best!2. How does the tuning of Carmuse actually work?With over 20,000 kinds of setups Carmuse helps you personalize their favorite music.  With cross points and a curve across five vertical lines that denote bass, alto and tweeter, the amplifier app will heighten the resonance of music.  The customization begins with the manipulation of the curve.  For instance, a movement of the app’s virtual curve, either up or down, weakens or strengthens the bass.  The same can be said of the alto or tweeter features.And it visualize the process of locating the sound field inside the car!
to ensures stereo sound effect!with over 20,000 set up, Our app will amplify any type of music, rock or classical, define your own style!
3.  How to install a car amplifier traditionally?
Here is what crutchfield says: http://tinyurl.com/z5fa49m
Step #1: Running power wire
Step #2: Running turn-on wire and signal
cables
Step #3: Ground the amplifier
blablah, anyway, it requires disconnecting the battery and
a lot of wiring work!
And with Carmuse amplifier?
Sidestepping unnerving firewall hassles, the car audio boon has a one-step
installation process: simply connecting the Carmuse app cable into the
head unit’s power outlet. Why ? now it gets power from the head unit
instead of the battery inside your car, it's a major breakthrough we
thought of! So we deserve some applause here:-)4. How is the actual performance of Carmuse amplifier?
Class D and DSP Gurantees the premium sound quality!
Get some info if you doesn’t know
Class D: http://tinyurl.com/z3cb7ma
DSP: http://tinyurl.com/gsyfto2
What’s
good about Class D?
Making a car amplifier smaller, with lower
heat dissipation, and less electricity consumption, Hi-Fi sound quality is now
on tap.Why
DSP?
The digital sound processor strips away the
sound-shaping limitations enforced by your factory stereo and sends a clean
signal to your external amplifiers. The amps send the signal to your speakers
and subs. Your reward will be resonant lows, sparkling highs, and a realistic
sense of space and depth.5. What
speakers does it drive?
Carmuse is a 4 channel amplifier with 50w
wattage output wattage for each channel, so does it mean it could only drive
speakers of 50 wattage? Nope!
We have tested for
many times and the result proves that it could drive speakers up to 100w due to
its conversion rate as we’re getting power from head unit .Unlike getting power
from the battery , it doesn’t supply power for other uses like navigator etc and
focus on supplying power for amplifier to drive speakers, it is the part our
engineers is proud of after many days of hardwork.So what more could you ask for?6. Compatibility statementCarmuse amplifier can only be suitable for Volkswagen and some of Skoda car right now。After success on Indiegogo, connection for wiring kit compatible with more car models will be provided, please refer to our official website about the compatibility statement and  leave note of the right connection kit type when ordering, or you could provide the info of: car brand, model, year of manufacturing and category( basic/general/delux).

tell you about Guardian Key.<span>  As you can
probably relate, we were tired of seeing bulky inefficient options on the
market for self-protection. Not only
were they inconvenient but also we don’t believe they would keep you safe. That is why we have created The Guardian Key and
now anyone can feel safe and protected with ease.  The Guardian Key is a lightweight, easy to
use protection tool.  The Guardian Key
can inflict mass amounts of pain in three ways against your assailant; you can
slash, jab and twist the key with minimal effort to cause immense pain.  We feel we have revolutionized the way we can
defend ourselves, no matter what your size or strength.  </span>
<p>The goal of this campaign is to reach
like-minded people for collaboration, raise money in exchange for early access
and rewards, and we also want to spread the word.<span>  The more people we can get using The Guardian
Key the more functional and successful it will be.  So this campaign will give you the basics on
our efforts and progress.  Beyond that we
encourage you to ask us questions, donate and get involved.  We developed “The Guardian Key” for your
benefit, so enjoy!  We believe we are
really onto an easier way to protect ourselves with maximum efficiency.</span></p>

yourself a breeze. The Guardian Key comes packed with scientific evidence that
backs up our methods of inflicting pain using the least amount of effort.<span>  The current options are heavy, bulky and
therefore not accessible in times of need, well not anymore. With our device

<img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><b>Overview</b>
</h2>
<p>Our popular culture reinforces the idea
that finding proper protection for yourself is hard, time consuming to utilize
and sometimes not reachable in times of need. We're out to change that one “The
Guardian Key” at a time! Help us establish this initiative to serve people in
need of a solution. As
little as $10 gets<span>  “The Guardian Key” to
an individual and can change their ideas and their personal safety for the rest
of their life. </span><span>Finding out
you can take care of yourself and feel protected against crime will be life
changing. Empower us to make this vision a reality with a donation to this
project today!</span></p>
<h2><b><span>More about the Project</span></b></h2>
<p>If your neighborhood is not as safe as it used
to be, then you have something in common with the rest of the country.<span>  All over America, crime is on the rise.  According to a government survey that was
just released, violent crime in the United States increased by 15 percent last
year, and property crime was up by 12 percent. 
If violent crime keeps increasing at this rate, it will approximately
double in just six years.– This
fact prompted us to dig deeper into a solution. 
This is where we started to envision “The Guardian Key” and all the
possible benefits we could bring to people:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>Efficient protective
measures</li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>Increased sense of safety</li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>Ability for smaller or
weaker people to protect without force</li>
</ul>
<p>When
reviewing these benefits, features and much more, it inspired and assured us
that this is a product that needs to be created. We feel if executed properly
we can reach a large market of people in need of an easier way to gain
confidence in their safety and security in uncertain times.<span>  Our features will make us incredibly
qualified to succeed in the self-security industry.  This paired with attention to detail and
quality service will make us a key player if not leader in the industry. Our
mission is to take care of every funder, supporter and customer with the utmost
respect and care.  We feel this will be
the key to our growth.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445034788/dawpsckbgylmwofdig5s.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><br/><p></p>

<br/><b></b><p></p></div>","Hello, my name is Jim and I am here to
tell you about Guardian Key.  As you can
probably relate, we were tired of seeing bulky inefficient options on the
market for self-protection. Not only
were they inconvenient but also we don’t believe they would keep you safe. That is why we have created The Guardian Key and
now anyone can feel safe and protected with ease.  The Guardian Key is a lightweight, easy to
use protection tool.  The Guardian Key
can inflict mass amounts of pain in three ways against your assailant; you can
slash, jab and twist the key with minimal effort to cause immense pain.  We feel we have revolutionized the way we can
defend ourselves, no matter what your size or strength.  
The goal of this campaign is to reach
like-minded people for collaboration, raise money in exchange for early access
and rewards, and we also want to spread the word.  The more people we can get using The Guardian
Key the more functional and successful it will be.  So this campaign will give you the basics on
our efforts and progress.  Beyond that we
encourage you to ask us questions, donate and get involved.  We developed “The Guardian Key” for your
benefit, so enjoy!  We believe we are
really onto an easier way to protect ourselves with maximum efficiency.


Do you ever think about what you would do if
you were attacked?


Do you want to learn how to better protect
yourself but don’t know how?


Are you interested in learning more about self-defense
but don’t have the time?


If you answered, “Yes” to any of these
questions, you may want to keep reading…

Crime is on the rise:
With our economy in the tank some people are finding themselves becoming desperate.  And as we all know desperate people resort to desperate crimes.   A crime takes place every 5 seconds in the United States.  Crimes like Rape, Assault and Robbery are happening around us every day.  There is no need for anyone to become a horrible statistic anymore.                       We are here to introduce the solution!!
                                              
The Guardian Key: From the Secret Service to Your Pocket!
Welcome
to the new and improved way to protect yourself! A simple flick or twist of your
wrist with the guardian key and you will be inflicting enormous pain on your
assailant. These precious seconds will help you escape a dangerous situation
and seek safety.  We developed our patented designed device to make defending
yourself a breeze. The Guardian Key comes packed with scientific evidence that
backs up our methods of inflicting pain using the least amount of effort.  The current options are heavy, bulky and
therefore not accessible in times of need, well not anymore. With our device
you can make self-defense a seamless reaction. Guardian Keys allow people to take advantage
of our education from the secret service along with years of experience as a
design engineer that we have poured into our product design. 



Overview

Our popular culture reinforces the idea
that finding proper protection for yourself is hard, time consuming to utilize
and sometimes not reachable in times of need. We're out to change that one “The
Guardian Key” at a time! Help us establish this initiative to serve people in
need of a solution. As
little as $10 gets  “The Guardian Key” to
an individual and can change their ideas and their personal safety for the rest
of their life. Finding out
you can take care of yourself and feel protected against crime will be life
changing. Empower us to make this vision a reality with a donation to this
project today!
More about the Project
If your neighborhood is not as safe as it used
to be, then you have something in common with the rest of the country.  All over America, crime is on the rise.  According to a government survey that was
just released, violent crime in the United States increased by 15 percent last
year, and property crime was up by 12 percent. 
If violent crime keeps increasing at this rate, it will approximately
double in just six years.– This
fact prompted us to dig deeper into a solution. 
This is where we started to envision “The Guardian Key” and all the
possible benefits we could bring to people:


Efficient protective
measures

Increased sense of safety

Ability for smaller or
weaker people to protect without force

When
reviewing these benefits, features and much more, it inspired and assured us
that this is a product that needs to be created. We feel if executed properly
we can reach a large market of people in need of an easier way to gain
confidence in their safety and security in uncertain times.  Our features will make us incredibly
qualified to succeed in the self-security industry.  This paired with attention to detail and
quality service will make us a key player if not leader in the industry. Our
mission is to take care of every funder, supporter and customer with the utmost
respect and care.  We feel this will be
the key to our growth.

About Us

the first version of the Guardian key over 20 years ago, and now acts as our

the camera as a director and now our marketing lead. And I'm Jim Story our spokesperson
and engineer. I have been a design engineer for over the last 15 years and have

product I'm responsible for engineering design and manufacturing.  Collaboratively we will be utilizing all of
our strengths to push Guardian Key onto the market and into your homes, pockets

Guardian Key in reach.

<p>Packing with plastics

developed a surprising carton packing especially for our product.</p>

<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>we decided instead
of expensive packing, to give a free world wide shipping !!! </p>
<p>by that, we will minimize our impact on the environment, by avoiding unnecessary waste from

 you will never
miss again your calendar alerts, any notifications, and breaking news, such as
facebook notifications, whatsapp meesseges, or Bloomberg financial alerts and live charts, and other important online push notifications.
Why Trapez?The Trapez unit is
named after its patented mirror trapezoid shape magnet holder.

 When removably attached to
the computer screen frame, the Trapez forms  a virtual Trapezoid gap under
the back of the smart-phone, parallel along to the computer screen. This shape
enables you operating with your fingers the main control
button of the cellular phone, while the cellular phone is attach to the computer
screen.
It enable you to remove the phone from the computer screen frame, and grab Trapez from any metal surface, ergonomically, easily and
smoothly because of its mirror trapezoid shape.
 
                     
                     
      
because shape mettersThanks to its clever patented magnetic holding system you can attach Trapez vertically to the screen
frame, and mount your smart phone In a vertical manner at eye level to trapez, such that phone stands vertically to the computer screen, or you can
hold your phone and other gadgets on the computer screen frame.  thanks to the Trapez
compactic size ( just the size of a match-box
) ,you can put it in your pocket, and attach it anywhere you want. Attach trapez
to a metal surface on your way, and attach it simulaneously to your cellular
phone to garden pole/street light and like, for making selfie or self-Film up to 10 meters range. dock your phone for charging

Because size matters                                                                             


            
NO OTHER PRODUCT LIKE THIS  IN THE MARKET, UNTIL TODAY!

Features
We spend over half of our day next to a computer screen, but we
don’t want to miss our cellular phone calendar alerts, and breaking news
and notifications.
All your push data
alerts comes ""near to you"" from 4000 miles, but you don’t have to
miss it, while concentrating in two screens, not at your eyes level                                   

                  TRAPEZ designed to be Carried in your Pocket for fast use

Packaging
Packing with plastics
and metals makes product costs higher,  with no actual benefits. That is why we
developed a surprising carton packing especially for our product.
                                  



we decided instead
of expensive packing, to give a free world wide shipping !!! 
by that, we will minimize our impact on the environment, by avoiding unnecessary waste from
packing materials.

<p></p></div>","The IdeaWe live in the 21 century with the amazing smartphones; capable of doing almost everything. Sometimes even keep your coffee warm. But there is still one task it’s not able to perform. That is to gather the control of every piece of remote-controlled electronic in the palm of your hand. We still have a ton of old plastic remote controls for our TV's and Sterios and other devices, but that time is at an end. With INOO you will gain back the control of all your devices.The project INOO IR removes the need separate remote controls for your TV, Audio players  and other electronic solutions based on infrared technology. With this elegant solution, you will not have to go look for lost remotes and such. With your phone you have the same options as you have on a normal remote, just with a few improvements and a ton of awesome. IR is still the operating standard on the market, so for old and new devices there will be a 100 % compatibility.Since the screen of the phone acts as control surface, you automatically have a backlit keyboard and it will be no problem to find the right button in the dark, nor will you ever loose your remote. Just phone it! The ringing should pinpoint the location  Control from anywhereThe box is placed in the desired room and is connected through wifi. So as long as you are on your own network, you will be able to control all the INOO devices you own. No more running down the stairs to turn off the television or stereo. How it worksIt’s quite simple. When you use the INOO application your phone sends a WIFI signal to the INOO box. The box then decodes the signal and transfers it as a standard IR signal to your appliances. Easy peacy! Even if your remote isn't to be found in our database which ha remotes for products from over 200 different brands, we have built in a feature which let your teach the application your remote control. So no matter what device you have, it will be supported.If you get a new phone you don't have to go through learning all the remotes again, you can store your settings and remotes on the INOO Box and just retrieve them from the box. Setting up the deviceJust power on the INOO type in your WIFI password into our app and that's it.Our appDesign“Less is more” - Van der Rohe The INOO electronic will be fitted in a nice black slim box, no more than a centimeter thick. Nice to see and easy to hide. We quote “A delecious little device”. Simplicity and functionality in perfect harmony.DevicesWe will natively support iPhone and Android Phones. Based on our goals we will support tablets as well. But remember this project is entirely open platform so even if your device isn't support, 3rd party developers will easily be able to create their own apps. Stretch goalsRewardsOpen SourceWe strive

 Hello every one! Greetings from Viorel Manoila and Steve Smith, My name is Viorel Manoila, designer and co-producer of ""DANMANN"" SmartPhone stand. Well, like my partner Steve Smith said, after a long way of tryings and errors finally we designed a minimalistic and elegant Smartphone Stand that uses NanoTechnology Suction pads to hold your phone in place.The DANMANN stand is affordable, functional, and simple. It’s extremely lightweight and is really useful. The best part about this stand is that it will not work only with your present SmartPhone, it will work with your past and future SmartPhones as well, given they have a flat back cover. 

Materials- aircraft grade aluminum + 2 NanoSuction pads.
 
NanoSuction- grips the phone and grips the stand to surface but is not sticky to the touch.

 
 Universal- works with all SmartPhones and most hard cases.
 Cord Management- Laser Triangle/Heart shape cut  is compatible with all OEM SmartPhone charging cables.
 Timeless Design- works with past, present and future SmartPhones and cords.  The DANMANN Stand comes in Black, White, Silver, Pink and few Blue and two types of cord management: Triangle shape and Heart Shape.DANMANN stand was designed to perform better than traditional phone stands or docks.

<b><span>In brief</span></b><p><span><b><br/></b>
We have worked in security for over 15 years designing applications in physical
secure access (high value production lines, nuclear plants, etc.) and secure
data access (corporate intellectual property, bank client data, etc.).<br/>
While the concept of security is nowadays quite well established when it comes
to protecting physical assets or data, voice conversations are largely
forgotten and it is quite an easy task for anyone with basic electrical
knowledge to tap a phone line.<br/>
With the recent headlines on phone conversation eavesdropping, we decided it
was time something was done in this field because today, when you are chatting
with a friend, or with a business partner, the question isn't if someone else
is listening but how many others are listening.<br/><br/>
In order to bring our concept to life, we decided to involve those who are
concerned in the first line, that is YOU !<br/>
With your help, we will bring a device which secures voice conversations from
end to end.<br/>
It already has a name : ""<b><i>HUSH</i></b>"" and we already developed
a working prototype. <br/>
Thanks to the Indiegogo financing we will finalize the development and
industrialize it.<br/><b><br/><br/>
The system</b><br/><br/>
Telephone tapping can take place anywhere the signal travels along the path :
in the telephone itself, in the wires which run to the wall, the home lines,
the street lines and for well equipped individuals or governments, in the
telephone centrals, antennas or major communication axis. For this reason, it
was clear to us that the voice data should be encrypted as soon as possible : <i>right
off the microphone</i>. <br/><br/><b><i>HUSH</i></b> is put into action between the telephone handset and the
telephone body. This way, the voice data is already encrypted before it even
enters the telephone.<br/>
In case of a cell phone, it can be used by acting as a relay between a
bluetooth headset and the phone.<br/>
This way, even if someone is able to hack the phone itself, for example with a
malicious software installed on your smartphone, the voice data already is
protected.<br/><br/>
The encryption is based on a proprietary variation of the SSL protocol which is
used for protecting internet secure transactions.<br/>
The data not only is encrypted but also the system makes sure that your correspondent
is indeed the person you expect. <br/><br/>
For now, we have developed and assembled two prototypes which we successfully
put to work on a 500 km conversation between Switzerland and France.<br/><br/><br/><b>Use of your contribution</b><br/><br/>
We have set the financing goal to 50'000 USD.<br/><br/>
The first 25'000 $ will allow us to complete the development and produce the 10
first prototypes for field testing.<br/>
The next 18'000 $ will be invested for the industrialization of the device and
the manufacturing of a small series of 50 pieces for further field testing.<br/>
The rest will allow us to correct the bugs detected during the field testing
and be ready for mass production.<br/><br/>
Because this project only makes sense if it is completed, we opted for the full
financing option.<br/>
We believe that it does answer a real need and that many people will support
it.<br/><br/>
If the fundraising goes over the limit, the money will be invested in reducing
the manufacturing cost as well as extending the capabilities of <b><i>HUSH</i></b>
 to DECT phones (which is otherwise
planned for version 2).<br/></span></p>

And on top of that you will help us giving back its true meaning to
""private"" conversations.<br/><br/><br/><b>Wanna know more ?</b><br/><br/>
Recent news have taken a toll on many persons' confidence that nobody is spying
on their conversation.<br/>
For many, it is now a fact and nobody can do anything about it. <br/><br/>
We don't agree. While it is indeed a fact that spying equipment is easily
available on the internet and that criminal or government data collection is
virtually impossible to dismantle, it is possible to make sure that the
information collected is useless.<br/>
With <b><i>HUSH</i></b> in action, people will be able to exchange information, either casual
or valuable, being certain that a nosy neighbour, a competitor or any other ill
intentioned individual will only collect garbage.<br/><br/>
And <b><i>HUSH</i></b> is taking things one step further in protecting you by
making sure that you are talking to the right person. <br/>
In companies, especially large and/or international ones, individuals don't
always know each other very well.<br/>
Social engineering has been increasingly used by scammers against such
companies to obtain information or money.<br/>
While it is easy to pretend to be someone or mandated by someone if you know
the right information, it is virtually impossible to do so if you, or at least
your telephone, is signed by a certificate.<br/>
This same principle is used in banking transactions to insure the bank that you
are the client you pretend to be and that you are indeed connected to the bank
and not on a fraudulent third-party website. <span><b><i>HUSH</i></b> is based on a powerful processor which allows complex online encryption.<br/><br/>
Once a clear communication is established, the two speakers activate their <b><i>HUSH</i></b>
device. A certificate is exchanged and validates the encryption key.<br/>
The data from the microphone is then digitized and compressed. After
encryption, a modem transforms the encrypted data into signals compatible with
the telephone line requirements.<br/>
On the receiving end, the data is decoded and the clear signal is sent to the
receiver's handset.<br/><br/>
If a cell phone is used, <b><i>HUSH</i></b> will use the bluetooth interface. <br/><br/>
DECT phones will be included in a future version of <b><i>HUSH</i></b> unless
the project gets financed well over the goal, in which case we will include it
in version 1.<br/><br/>
Many current projects propose a specific phone with multiple locks so that no
hacking of the phone is possible. But this means you have to buy a new phone,
learn how to use it, transfer all your data, contacts, etc.<br/>
We decided to add a function to your existing installation. You dont' change
your habits, Hush is plug and play and you can activate it at any time, right
in the middle of a conversation.<br/><br/><b><br/>
How can you help</b> ?<br/><br/>
First, of course, you can help this project by participating in the funding.<br/>
Check the rewards section to see what each level of funding entitles you to
get.</span></p>
<p>You can also help us by funding a ‘beta-test’ level.<br/><br/>
If you cannot afford to support us financially but you do think that the
project is cool, talk about it around you, tweet it, write in local newspapers,

<p><b>En bref</b></p>
<p>Nous avons travaillé dans le domaine de la
sécurité pendant plus de 15 ans dans des projets tels que la sécurisation
d'accès physique (centres de production de produits de valeur, centrales
nucléaires, etc.) et la sécurisation d'accès aux données (données bancaires,
propriété intellectuelle, etc.)</p>
<p>Si le concept de sécurité est à présent
relativement bien établi lorsqu'il s'agit d'éléments physiques ou de données,
les conversations téléphoniques sont par contre largement oubliées. Il est
pourtant facile, pour une personne possédant des connaissances techniques de
base, de se connecter à une ligne téléphonique tierce.</p>
<p>Avec les récents développements concernant des
programmes d'écoute systématiques, nous avons décidé qu'il était temps d'agir.
Car aujourd'hui, lorsque vous conversez avec un ami ou un partenaire
commercial, la question n'est pas de savoir si quelqu'un vous écoute mais
combien de personnes le font.</p>
<p>Pour donner vie à notre idée, nous avons
décidé d'inclure dans notre projet les personnes les plus concernées,
c'est-à-dire VOUS !</p>
<p>Avec votre aide, nous mettrons sur le marché

<p><b>Le système</b></p>
<p>L'écoute téléphonique peut prendre place en
tout point du cheminement de l'information : dans le téléphone lui-même, le
câble qui le relie à la prise murale, les câbles de l'immeuble ou de liaison au
central de quartier et, pour des individus bien équipés ou un gouvernement, au
niveau des centraux, des antennes ou des axes de transmission internationaux.
Pour cette raison, il nous est clairement apparu que les données devaient être
cryptées le plus tôt possible: dès la sortie du microphone.</p>
<p>HUSH se place entre le combiné et le téléphone
lui-même. De cette manière, le signal vocal est déjà crypté lorsqu'il atteint
le téléphone. </p>
<p>Dans le cas d'un téléphone cellulaire
(téléphone portable), l'appareil agit comme un relais entre une oreillette
bluetooth et le téléphone.</p>
<p>De cette manière, même si une personne est en
mesure de hacker le téléphone, par exemple avec une application malveillante,
les données vocales sont déjà protégées.</p>
<p>Le cryptage est basé sur une variante
propriétaire du protocole SSL utilisé pour la protection des transactions
sécurisées sur Internet. De plus, non seulement les données sont chiffrées mais
en plus le système s'assure que votre correspondant est bien la bonne personne.</p>
<p>Pour le moment, nous avons mis en oeuvre deux

Lampp is a smart light


that uses your phone screen as its light source.


It comes with an app to let you choose the adequate atmosphere for each situation.


Lampp started with a unique approach to light sources, a smart light that uses the light of our smart phones. LAMPP is a lamp shade and an app that allows you to control the color and the intensity of the light, play music or define the connectivity on your device. With LAMPP you can choose the adequate atmosphere for each situation.
We’ve designed a durable, economic and beautiful product to accompany your intimate moments. This versatile product allows you to instantly create a great atmosphere while covering your phone when you don’t want to be disturbed. It is made in silicon so you can easily take it with you anywhere you go.
We need your support to be able to produce the first ever LAMPPs. With your support, we will be able to start up programming the app and investing in tooling to manufacture the first batch. With our goal we are making sure we can deliver the best quality product at an affordable price.





SIZES; WILL THE LAMPP FIT MY PHONE?

Yes! the
design suits ALL STANDARD PHONE SIZES up to the new iPhone6 or Samsung Gallaxy

SCHEDULE

With regard
to the production we have partnered with our friends Andrew and David @ Haythotnthwaite Design in China,
known for their exquisite quality standards. They have extensive experience
producing different types of products, some of them with silicon parts. So
we are confident that production will be carried out to perfection.
We’ve
been working with them and everything is set to start production immediately when we reach our goal.
Here are
the steps we’ll take:

January: End of the campaign. Set up to
start manufacturing. Make tooling and organise manufacturing. The app will be
fully programmed and running by the end of January.
February: Lampp manufacturing, quality
control and packaging + Shiping Lampps;
Backers that have chosen the Direct Courier Service (extra
cost of $10) will receive their LAMPP.
March: Backers that have chosen the Standard
Courier Service -sea shipping takes up to 5 weeks, will receive their LAMPP.



HOW IT WORKS


Lampp is a combination of an APP and a silicon SHADE that addapts to your
smartphone, to instantly create a Smart mood light.
Below we explain in more detail how we’ve designed each element.



Choose the appropriate atmosphere for each situation.



The app
comes with 6 preset modes, which can also be used on plane mode if you wish to totally disconnect your phone and use it
only as a light source.
Get in
touch and let us know how you’d like LAMPP to change the atmospheres in your
own life! We propose:
— Sunrise: Set your alarm and the light will dimm up before your alarm goes off— Light: Choose the desired color— Relax: Harmonious warm rainbow coloured light + jazz— Party: Music reactive— Romantic: Warm-reddish steady or fading light— Night: Intimate, slow fading rainbow

*To be developed for Android and IOS.



Stretch goal $100.000
Imagine you
can define the lighting and colour effects for each mood, play your
favourite tunes and control the connectivity of your device when you don't
want to be disturbed.
If we reach
$100.000 we will be able to develop the app that we envision. It would come
with extensive software to let you edit and pre-set your very own atmospheres.
Light and colour effects— Choose a specific light tone.— Have the color and the intensity of the light changing at the desirable speed.— Preset movement effects such as shading, flashing or blinking.— Let it react to the rhythm of your music
Music— It connects to your music library.— Preset your own playlists for each mood.
Disconnect— Control the connectivity of your device and get notified by light instead of sound when you get a call or a message.— Less intrusive; it silences your phone and alerts you with light instead of sound.— For Android only, for iOS simply silent your phone or set plane mode.









The LAMPP shade was designed
to optimise and redirect the light emitted by the
screens of our devices, like
if we could physically inflate the flat screen of our phones.
Our goal
was how to better optimise and redirect the light coming from the screen. We
searched for the perfect form by making prototypes across a range of materials
from blown glass to casting plaster in balloons. 
The final form balances the
joyful, organic inflation of a “light balloon” with a proportioned junction
between LAMPP and your device.





Material: Injected Silicon.
We tested different materials and found that injection moulded silicon has the ideal properties for our purposes.


We've chosen Silicon for the following reasons.
— It is the material that best glows under most circumstances.— We are able to control its rigidity.— It is a very tough and durable material.— It is easy to move around, pack up and take with you everywhere you go.

will be packed and ship individually in their own packaging.

That’s why we used high quality materials to build a cord that matches your high-end devices. The top part of the connector is designed using a laser cut plexiglass sheet that allows light to pass through the connector and give the right amount of light. The connector head itself is constructed out of a beautiful anodized aluminum with hair lining treatment to match your other Apple products. The cord is made of a durable and flexible gooseneck material that gives you the ability to bend it in many different shapes with enough strength to hold the weight of your iPhone5/5S in any position. By engineering the smallest possible structure, we were able to use these fine materials and still bring FiLUX to you at an affordable price. Great things do come in small packages.<br/><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/332751/files/20140127110400-technical-data.png?1390849440"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/332815/files/20140127111713-whatitcando.png?1390850233"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/332821/files/20140127111753-howstarted.png?1390850273"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>After I upgraded to the iPhone 5, I automatically lost the ability to use all of my previously purchased accessories that were compatible with the older iPhones. Apple changed the old connector that was around for more than a decade and replaced it with a thin reversible lightning connector. In fact, Apple changed all of their devices to work only with the new connector. For an Apple geek who tries to stay within one platform, this was devastating.  Long hours of FaceTime, watching movies, and surfing the web seemed to be impossible without my previous docks and accessories. At the same time, my major problem has always been plugging my phone into the charger at night. With the new smaller connector, this task seemed even harder in the dark.</p><p>My initial step towards creating FiLUX was to sketch the design. The intent was to create a product that would work as a dock, be portable, be strong and also be a solution to my long-lasting issue of plugging the phone to the connector in the dark. After months of trial and error, my final idea was to create a flexible cord that would not only charge the phone, but also sync it and work as a flashlight. That’s how FiLUX was born. You can view some pictures of my initial sketches in the Prototype Process section.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/332825/files/20140127111847-prototype.png?1390850327"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>We went through three prototype stages before we finalized our design and basic functionalities. Our first prototype was designed and handmade using a plexiglass tube as the complete head of the connector. It took a couple of tries to come up with the perfect thickness for the gooseneck material to be able to hold the phone in different positions. The microcontroller chip hardware and software design was the hardest part of the project. We've managed to position enough LED lights that fit within the connector and give the user enough light to be able to carry on with normal tasks in complete darkness. </p><p><b>Here is a video of our first prototype stage:</b></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe border=""0"" height=""326"" src=""https://media.embed.ly/1/frame?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F63637649&amp;width=580&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;height=326&amp;secure=true"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><p>After the first prototype stage, we started redesigning the head of the connector. The finalized design is now using a beautiful anodized aluminum with a hair lining treatment to match other Apple products and provide a more reliable hold for the cord. We increased the number of LEDs from the previous prototypes to provide more intense light, which is useful for reading and writing. We have also added a blue indicator light that lights up after connecting the device to FiLUX. The indicator light is a great way to make sure the cable is charging, and it works as a night light. <br/></p><p></p><p><b></b></p><p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/332841/files/20140127112126-PCBs.png?1390850486"" src="""" style=""""/></b></p><p></p><p><b>Design - </b>We finalized our design, component's materials, microcontroller chip software, hardware design, and gooseneck material's ideal thickness.</p><p><b>Manufacturer</b> – We have established a great working relationship with our licensed contract manufacturer and have scheduled manufacturing of the parts right after project's successful funding.</p><p><b>Process</b> – We have already tried out various production processes and are figuring out what works best.</p><p><b>Costs</b> – We set up a financial calculation based on the experience from our previous project and have addressed hidden costs.</p><p><b>Samples</b> – We now have working samples and are testing the effect of its long term use.

Follow Vamepo on Twitter@vampeo and for more specification, please visit our blog!Compatibility:Works with every Apple iPhone, iPad & iPod with a Lightning connector. This includes the iPhone 5, 5C & 5S, iPad 4, iPad Mini, iPod Touch, iPod Nano and all new iOS devices. For an updated compatibility list, click here.Remarkable lighting & Smart Features:There are 6 bright white LED lights inside that connector that give a luminous intensity of 270 lux from an 18"" distance. It is perfect for reading and writing in a low light environment. There is also one blue LED light that turns on as soon as the device is connected to the cord. This light is intended to help you locate your device in the dark and doubles as a great night light.USB Powered:FiLUX can be powered by any laptop computer (or universal charger) with a USB jack. As LEDs have become more and more efficient, it is now possible to provide excellent levels of task lighting by connecting the FiLUX to a standard 5V USB charger.Refined Design, Beautiful Materials & Finishes:It was important for the final product to not only look good, but feel good from the very first touch. That’s why we used high quality materials to build a cord that matches your high-end devices. The top part of the connector is designed using a laser cut plexiglass sheet that allows light to pass through the connector and give the right amount of light. The connector head itself is constructed out of a beautiful anodized aluminum with hair lining treatment to match your other Apple products. The cord is made of a durable and flexible gooseneck material that gives you the ability to bend it in many different shapes with enough strength to hold the weight of your iPhone5/5S in any position. By engineering the smallest possible structure, we were able to use these fine materials and still bring FiLUX to you at an affordable price. Great things do come in small packages.After I upgraded to the iPhone 5, I automatically lost the ability to use all of my previously purchased accessories that were compatible with the older iPhones. Apple changed the old connector that was around for more than a decade and replaced it with a thin reversible lightning connector. In fact, Apple changed all of their devices to work only with the new connector. For an Apple geek who tries to stay within one platform, this was devastating.  Long hours of FaceTime, watching movies, and surfing the web seemed to be impossible without my previous docks and accessories. At the same time, my major problem has always been plugging my phone into the charger at night. With the new smaller connector, this task seemed even harder in the dark.My initial step towards creating FiLUX was to sketch the design. The intent was to create a product that would work as a dock, be portable, be strong and also be a solution to my long-lasting issue of plugging the phone to the connector in the dark. After months of trial and error, my final idea was to create a flexible cord that would not only charge the phone, but also sync it and work as a flashlight. That’s how FiLUX was born. You can view some pictures of my initial sketches in the Prototype Process section.We went through three prototype stages before we finalized our design and basic functionalities. Our first prototype was designed and handmade using a plexiglass tube as the complete head of the connector. It took a couple of tries to come up with the perfect thickness for the gooseneck material to be able to hold the phone in different positions. The microcontroller chip hardware and software design was the hardest part of the project. We've managed to position enough LED lights that fit within the connector and give the user enough light to be able to carry on with normal tasks in complete darkness. Here is a video of our first prototype stage:After the first prototype stage, we started redesigning the head of the connector. The finalized design is now using a beautiful anodized aluminum with a hair lining treatment to match other Apple products and provide a more reliable hold for the cord. We increased the number of LEDs from the previous prototypes to provide more intense light, which is useful for reading and writing. We have also added a blue indicator light that lights up after connecting the device to FiLUX. The indicator light is a great way to make sure the cable is charging, and it works as a night light. Design - We finalized our design, component's materials, microcontroller chip software, hardware design, and gooseneck material's ideal thickness.Manufacturer – We have established a great working relationship with our licensed contract manufacturer and have scheduled manufacturing of the parts right after project's successful funding.Process – We have already tried out various production processes and are figuring out what works best.Costs – We set up a financial calculation based on the experience from our previous project and have addressed hidden costs.Samples – We now have working samples and are testing the effect of its long term use. We are ready to go to the next step.Why We Need You?Lightning connector, Male USB - The components that make up the cord connectors.Tooling – We have to create custom tools for every part. (Very expensive!)Manufacturing - The FiLUX look and feel is very important to us, so the actual production is a specialized series of steps.Packaging – Concepts for packaging are in progress. You will be able to help us with this!Shipping - Getting your FiLUX to you, wherever you are in the world.Stretch GoalOur goal is to improve the design and functionality of FiLUX to its maximum capacity. Therefore, we have set ourselves a milestone with a precise calculated budget in order to add these new innovative features to FiLUX. To keep the excitement active, we will unlock each feature once we hit or get very close to the intended goal.

<p><strong>What </strong><strong>is </strong><strong>The </strong><strong>Volt </strong><strong>Makers?</strong></p>
<p>It's just us, Christophe, Alexandre, Tristan and Bertrand and many people that have volunteered tons of time toward the company. The Volt Makers is based in Paris, France. Alex loves long trips on the back of a horse or on a bike, Christophe, an electronic engineer is fond of innovation, the third one is an expert in green products and a keen surfer and Bertrand is a talented designer. The Volt Makers came out of these four mindsets.</p>
<p><strong>Is </strong><strong>the </strong><strong>Voltm</strong><strong>aker </strong><strong>patented?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. Our product has been proudly patented since shortly after having being invented in April 2012.</p>
<p><strong>How </strong><strong>big </strong><strong>is </strong><strong>the </strong><strong>Voltmaker?</strong></p>
<p>It's 3.6 cm (1.4 '') in diameter and 15.5 cm (6.1 '') long. It weighs around 300 grams (10.6 ounces). It's actually smaller than the one you can see in the movie which is not the latest version. </p>
<p><strong>How </strong><strong>are </strong><strong>the </strong><strong>Voltmakers </strong><strong>made?</strong></p>
<p>The Voltmakers will be produced by our industrial partner whose offices and production units are located in Europe and China.</p>
<p><strong>When </strong><strong>will </strong><strong>the </strong><strong>Voltmakers </strong><strong>shipped </strong><strong>exactly?</strong></p>
<p>The product will be available before Christmas 2013. Most probably on October / November.</p>
<p><strong>Which </strong><strong>devices </strong><strong>can </strong><strong>I </strong><strong>charge </strong><strong>with </strong><strong>the </strong><strong>Volt</strong><strong>m</strong><strong>aker?</strong></p>
<p>You can charge any very low voltage electronic device that has a USB port, such as your phone, your MP3 player, your camera, your GPS device….</p>
<p><strong>Will </strong><strong>I </strong><strong>be </strong><strong>able </strong><strong>to </strong><strong>order </strong><strong>replacement </strong><strong>parts?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, please contact customer service at customer@thevoltmakers.com.</p>
<p><strong>Will </strong><strong>The </strong><strong>Volt </strong><strong>Makers </strong><strong>affect </strong><strong>my </strong><strong>phone?</strong></p>
<p>No, the product we develop won’t affect your phone. The 5V regulated output guaranties security of your devices. The USB output is exactly the same as your computer, laptop…</p>
<p><strong>Can </strong><strong>I </strong><strong>choose </strong><strong>the </strong><strong>color </strong><strong>of </strong><strong>my V</strong><strong>oltmaker?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, you can choose between the following colors: pink, blue, green and aluminum. You will receive an email before the shipping so you can confirm the color you want. Buy now, choose later!</p>
<p><strong>How long should I spin the ratchet to be able to make a phone call?</strong></p>
<p>Basically, the ratio is between 1:1 and 1:4 depending on the way you turn the ratchet, the strength of the gesture and the type of phone you have. On average, 2 minutes of spinning will give you enough battery power to make a few minutes long urgent call.<strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>How long should I spin the ratchet to be able to use the flashlight?</strong></p>
<p>Two minutes of spinning will give you around 20 minutes of lighting.<strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>How long should I generate energy to be able to fully charge the battery?</strong></p>
<p>Due to the fact that the Voltmaker is equipped with a very powerful battery (2,000mAh - able to fully charge your iPhone), fully recharging the battery by spinning the ratchet would take you about 2-3 hours! This is why we recommend that you should recharge your Voltmaker using your standard USB wall charger at home. You should only use the manual generator in case of emergency in order to give a few minutes long phone call.<strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Is the cable included with the Voltmaker?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. Each Voltmaker will be delivered with a USB cable (standard type A/micro USB).</p>

Head over to www.thevoltmakers.com for more info and to place a pre-order or click directly here.

The Volt Makers' team thanks you a lot for your support. Even if we didn't achieve our goal on Indiegogo, we are still working to produce the Voltmaker before Christmas!

Want to help The Volt Makers? Follow us on Facebook or Twitter or contact us at contact@thevoltmakers.com!
We invented, designed and tested this awesome tool and our partners are ready to industrialize the production and make it available for everyone! All we need is a kick-start. Thank you so much for making it all happen!

Power your electronic devices wherever and whenever you need to!


Are you sick of your batteries dying at the very moment you need them to make an urgent call, use a torch to change a blown fuse or find your position on a GPS when you are lost in the outdoors?
Let us introduce the Voltmaker, designed to save the day in such situations. An innovative universal device which can be operated with one single hand in case of emergency but which can also be  charged up at home to offer you security.
This innovation provides the security of charging up a device immediately and also acts as a second battery. This is definitely a endless source of power for your smartphone, using renewable energy.

The Voltmaker is ideal for hikers, travellers and urbanites whether in the city or in the countryside and in particular in places where electricity is scarce. Being small and compact, this device tucks away nicely in your backpack, handbag, glove box or even your jacket pocket ready to save the day.

How does it work?

1/ At home: fully charge the Voltmaker with your standard USB wall charger.

2/ Is your phone's battery dead? Plug the Voltmaker into your phone. You can fully charge it with the energy contained in your Voltmaker's battery.

3/ Are your phone AND your Voltmaker's batteries dead?

With a unique, simple, fast, and fun charging system, anyone can generate energy for all kinds of portable electronics including cell phones, smartphones, iPods, among others.
With a few twists of the wrist this hand-held device is capable of generating a few extra minutes of power for your telephone or other small appliances that demand lower power levels (MP3 players, torches, GPS devices, cameras, etc.). This system uses kinetic energy.
4/ Need some light? a clever USB system transforms the Voltmaker into a torch, making the device multi-purpose.

Specifications
Battery: 2,000mAh Lithium Output: 5V USB (standard A) Input: 5V USB (micro)  Weight: Approximately 300 grams / 10.6 ounces Size: 15,5cm/6.1'' (length), 3,6 cm/1.4'' (diameter)
Accessories: flashlight module

Design
We have decided to develop a high-end dynamo product with high performance by focusing on details. We wanted the Voltmaker to be cool. We made it! We gave it a pure and uncluttered aspect.
We have gone above and beyond all the existing autonomous charging solutions to develop a unique product presenting outstanding features: playful use, robustness, multipurposeness and smartness.
Its tubular form makes it perfectly ergonomic, the simple impulse of the ratchet being enough for the generator to work.
What we have thought up and designed requires very few efforts - it can be operated using only one hand and it's actually very fun to use. The innovation lies in the gesture itself.


A scalable product

The Voltmaker is designed to be scalable. Additional modules can be plugged into it thanks to its ingenious USB interconnection system (a standard Type A female connector). As of today, we have developed a flashlight module and our engineers are currently designing the modules of tomorrow: a radio, a fan, an emergency stroboscopic module, a water sterilizer….

 
Security at all times
We wanted a high-performing charger built with the most recent technology. You can charge the Voltmaker with your standard USB wall charger. The Voltmaker then acts as a backup power source for your USB-powered devices. You can charge your phone, and other devices simply by plugging your standard charging cable into to the standard USB port on the Voltmaker.

The Voltmaker contains a battery which can fully recharge a smartphone under all circumstances. Its smart electronic system manages the charging process in a way that increases the battery life cycles, allowing years of use.
 
What they say about us:
Christophe Bricout (Embedded Electronic System’s Advisor at Cap'Tronic, a French government-funded program): ""an innovative project mixing a smart and optimized power solution""
Watt Consulting: "" We have been working months to optimize the electronic system and ensure the best efficiency compared with what exists on the market.""
 
The Voltmaker: a smart charger

 

Keyfeatures


Elegant: a bold design
A fast and entertaining recharging system
An eco-friendly technology
Apps for Android
An ingenious USB Connection
Smart with the use of microcontroller (for use of GPL, check our website)
Robust

 
 
 
Smartcharge on open source software (GNU GPL license)
The Voltmaker contains a microcontroller that ensures the communication with other devices plugged into it via USB.

The microcontrollers will provide endless opportunities: detection of the modules plugged in via USB, assessment of the amount of generated power, etc. Thanks to the microcontrollers, the process of charging up a device becomes smart. For example, they can modify the resistance of the generator.
The Voltmaker thus adapts itself to its user's strength, whether he or she is an adult or a child.

All our code will be released as free software, licensed under the GNU GPL, so that everyone can study and adapt the code according to his or her own needs.
Play with apps
The Volt Makers is composed of smart electronic devices which will enable you to:
- Play with apps during the charging up process and to use your Voltmaker as a video game controller
- Know the exact quantity of remaining energy
- And if you like, they'll enable you to join the Voltmakers’ community in order to know when and where the Voltmakers have been used by others: lost in the Sahara, on mount Kilimanjaro, etc…
If you're an app developer, big or small, please keep The Volt Makers in mind! Contact us.

Apps will be developed for Android phones.
Use of Funds
The Voltmaker has been designed, developed, tested and is operational. We need your help to take the next step. With you contribution we will put the Voltmaker into production.
We are an experienced team supported by highly professional partners. We’ve been working on The Volt Makers for more than 2 years now. Your contribution will help fund:

Production tooling
Large component order

Use it as a lighting device
Play games on your phone
Power any low voltage electronic device
The Voltmaker is perfect for camping, performing any outdoor activities, travelling, making a gift, etc… and soon it will be a solution for the off-grid population which needs both reliable phone charging and lighting systems.
Will there be future The Volt Makers products?
We have designed a unique system which is able to charge any extra low voltage device. We are already developing new products which you'll be able to connect to your Voltmaker: radios, lighting security systems, lighters … 
Send us a Twitter or Facebook message if you have an idea about a module you'd particularly like to add to your Voltmaker!
What is The Volt Makers?
It's just us, Christophe, Alexandre, Tristan and Bertrand and many people that have volunteered tons of time toward the company. The Volt Makers is based in Paris, France. Alex loves long trips on the back of a horse or on a bike, Christophe, an electronic engineer is fond of innovation, the third one is an expert in green products and a keen surfer and Bertrand is a talented designer. The Volt Makers came out of these four mindsets.
Is the Voltmaker patented?
Yes. Our product has been proudly patented since shortly after having being invented in April 2012.
How big is the Voltmaker?
It's 3.6 cm (1.4 '') in diameter and 15.5 cm (6.1 '') long. It weighs around 300 grams (10.6 ounces). It's actually smaller than the one you can see in the movie which is not the latest version. 
How are the Voltmakers made?
The Voltmakers will be produced by our industrial partner whose offices and production units are located in Europe and China.
When will the Voltmakers shipped exactly?
The product will be available before Christmas 2013. Most probably on October / November.
Which devices can I charge with the Voltmaker?
You can charge any very low voltage electronic device that has a USB port, such as your phone, your MP3 player, your camera, your GPS device….
Will I be able to order replacement parts?
Yes, please contact customer service at customer@thevoltmakers.com.
Will The Volt Makers affect my phone?
No, the product we develop won’t affect your phone. The 5V regulated output guaranties security of your devices. The USB output is exactly the same as your computer, laptop…
Can I choose the color of my Voltmaker?
Yes, you can choose between the following colors: pink, blue, green and aluminum. You will receive an email before the shipping so you can confirm the color you want. Buy now, choose later!
How long should I spin the ratchet to be able to make a phone call?
Basically, the ratio is between 1:1 and 1:4 depending on the way you turn the ratchet, the strength of the gesture and the type of phone you have. On average, 2 minutes of spinning will give you enough battery power to make a few minutes long urgent call.
How long should I spin the ratchet to be able to use the flashlight?
Two minutes of spinning will give you around 20 minutes of lighting.
How long should I generate energy to be able to fully charge the battery?
Due to the fact that the Voltmaker is equipped with a very powerful battery (2,000mAh - able to fully charge your iPhone), fully recharging the battery by spinning the ratchet would take you about 2-3 hours! This is why we recommend that you should recharge your Voltmaker using your standard USB wall charger at home. You should only use the manual generator in case of emergency in order to give a few minutes long phone call.
Is the cable included with the Voltmaker?
Yes. Each Voltmaker will be delivered with a USB cable (standard type A/micro USB).

The phone is almost dead, so you’d better charge it during the night. But where is the charger? Left at work? Maybe in another room? No, it has to be here somewhere, but where is that darn cable? You were already comfy, tucked in like a human burrito, and now you need to get up on a mission to find a charger. Don’t let this happen again! Use the Magnetic Charging Pad by your bed or on your nightstand and stay cozy and warm in bed.  Our time is valuable, that’s why our Magnetic Pad keeps it simple.Just connect it to an energy source, put the device on the top and the charging will start in the blink of an eye. Simple.   Three inductive coilsWhat makes the Magnetic Pad special are its THREE inductive coils. Most ordinary charging pads are equipped with just one, which makes it impossible to quickly connect them the smartphone. With three, you will always hit the right spot, because the inductive field is much stronger. It doesn’t matter where you put your device, it will ALWAYS work.    Suitable for iPhones!Some of you gadget geeks might say: that it’s impossible to wirelessly charge iPhones. IMPOSSIBLE IS NOTHING! We wouldn’t abandon Apple users, so we thought of a way to connect your phones too.It’s the Wireless Charging iPhone Cover, equipped with the inductive technology transmitter, designed especially for Apple devices. Available for iPhones models  5S, 5SE, 6, 6S, 6 Plus, 6S Plus. Just put the phone inside the cover, then on the top of the pad.

<h2>The NANO-EQ system (wireless controlled Digital Audio Equalizer 24bit/96KHz)</h2>
<p><img alt=""The complete set of NANO-EQ system modules compared to an iPhone"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img22.imageshack.us/img22/6494/ggx.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""The complete set of NANO-EQ system modules compared to an iPhone""/></p>
<h3>The NANO-EQ system is a Digital Audio Equalizer. But ... What is an Audio Equalizer?<span style=""font-size: 1.17em;""><br/></span>
</h3>
<p><strong>An Audio Equalizer is a typical component of a Hi-Fi system</strong> for listening to music (but can also be used in Home Cinema systems, if specifically designed), and <strong>its purpose is to make the sound more pleasing to the listener according to his musical tastes</strong>.</p>
<p>To achieve this goal, <strong>an Audio Equalizer divides the sound into several bands (audio components) and enables the listener to give more or less emphasis</strong> (through the equalization parameters)<strong> to these audio bands</strong>, according to his tastes. For example, it allows:</p>
<ul>
<li>to emphasize some treble to better listen to the voice of the singers;</li>
<li>to emphasize some bass to better listen the sound produced by a guitar or a bass instrument;</li>
<li>and so on ...</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In any typical equalizer, the equalization parameters can be changed only on the instrument itself, via buttons or levers to slide.</strong></p>
<p><strong>High-quality equalizers with low distortions may cost hundreds of dollars, while having not very small dimensions.</strong></p>
<p><strong><img alt=""Scheme of a typical Audio System"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img833.imageshack.us/img833/293/l4k.png"" src="""" style=""margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;"" title=""Scheme of a typical Audio System""/></strong></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>So, What is the NANO-EQ system goal?</h3>
</div>
<div>The NANO-EQ system goal is to give you:</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>a high quality Digital Audio Equalizer with 7 bands, or more (so, 7 equalization parameters that can be adjusted independently);</strong></li>
<li><strong>a reasonable low cost;</strong></li>
<li><strong>the feature to be connected to virtually any audio source type (turntables, CD players, DVD players, Blu-Ray players) thanks to the presence of the most common analog and digital connections;</strong></li>
<li><strong>a nice-looking and small packages;</strong></li>
<li><strong>easiness to transport thanks to its small size;</strong></li>
<li><strong>the feature to be able to use it both at home or in a car, thanks to the standard 12V input power connector;</strong></li>
<li><strong>the feature to control your equalization parameters via a simple iPhone or Android App, wireless;</strong></li>
<li><strong>the feature to use it in a Home Cinema system (<strong>systems </strong>up to 8 channels);</strong></li>
<li><strong>linearize the acoustics of the listening environment, to have a better listening experience.</strong></li>
</ul>
<div>
<h3>Why NANO-EQ system?</h3>
<p>The NANO-EQ is unique in the world because is designed following a ""get-only-what-you-need"" thought:<strong> the NANO-EQ system is composed of many small modules each of which gives you a specific feature; these modules can be connected togheter to compose your personal NANO-EQ system</strong>.</p>
<p>In this way, you can drastically reduce the overall size of your equalizations system and save your money if you don't need optional features.</p>
<h3>What Are The Advantages Of NANO-EQ system?</h3>
<p>There are many advatnages versus the traditional equalizer:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>the size</strong>: the target is to be able to offer a NANO-EQ 2 channel system (typical for audio stereo applications) by using only two modules in a very small space, estimated in 12x4x4 cm;</li>
<li>
<strong>the cost</strong>: the target is to make available to all consumers a simple NANO-EQ 2 channels system for around 150$, and we hope less (obviously our funders will receive their gifts first, and only some time later will be available a worldwide sale through a web site);</li>
<li>
<strong>the quality</strong>: best in class digital components will be used for the Analog-to-Digital and Digital-to-Analog Audio conversions with 24bit/96KHz sampling rate and Signal-to-Noise-Ratio &gt;120db; a powerful Signal Processor with &gt;1200MFLOPs computational power will be used for Audio filtering and equalization process;</li>
<li>
<strong>the flexibility</strong>: with our extremely modular design, you can get only the modules (so, the features) that you really want, saving your money;</li>
<li>
<strong>the portability</strong>: the NANO-EQ system is powered by a simple 12V adapter, which makes it easy to use at home or in car;</li>
<li>
<strong>the available input and output connections:</strong> the presence of RCA analog connections, 3.5mm jack connections and S/PDIF digital connections, allows it to be connected to virtually any audio source type and audio amplifiers / speakers system;</li>
<li>
<strong>the environment equalization feature</strong>: by using the specific modules and a microphone, you can linearize the acoustisc of the listening environment to have a listen close to perfection (this feature will be available by reaching the higher level goals, please see below);</li>
<li>
<strong>the home theater sorround feature</strong>: by using the specific modules, you can compose an 8 channels NANO-EQ system capable to decode some Dolby and DTS multi-channel codecs (such as Dolby 5.1 and DTS 5.1) without external decoder equipments (this feature will be available by reaching the higher goals, please see below);</li>
<li>
<strong>the graphic display feature (bonus)</strong>: by using the specific module, you can have a real-time graphic-style display, which displays in real-time the audio levels with a series of led bars (this feature will be available by reaching the higher level goals, please see below);</li>
</ul>

<h2>The NANO-EQ system in details</h2>
<p>The NANO-EQ system is composed of 5 modules plus 1 bonus module (in case all the goals are successfully achieved), each of which gives you a spcific feature: in the followings lines are described all the modules and the goal needed to fully develop them.</p>
<h3>The basic modules needed for all: NANO-POWER and NANO-EQ modules</h3>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">NANO-POWER module</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;""><img alt=""NANO-POWER module, front view"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://imageshack.us/a/img24/2598/0ute.png"" src="""" style=""margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px; vertical-align: top;"" title=""NANO-POWER module, front view""/><img alt=""NANO-POWER module, back view"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://imageshack.us/a/img43/1652/udy0.png"" src="""" style=""margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px; vertical-align: top;"" title=""NANO-POWER module, back view""/></span></p>
<p><strong>The NANO-POWER module</strong> is a basic module with which you can <strong>turn on/off the NANO-EQ system and turn on/off the wireless communication feature</strong> to save power (or to reduce the RF interferences) when there is no need to change equalization parameters.</p>
<p>This module has a <strong>standard connector for receiving the 12V input power</strong> needed by the NANO-EQ system to work: the other modules receive the input power by this NANO-POWER module by connecting to the connectors on the left and right panel (see the images above).</p>
<p><strong>Through a simple iPhone or Android application it is possible to communicate with the NANO-POWER module to control and edit the equalization parameters</strong> of each audio band available, for each channel of the NANO-EQ system.</p>
<p>Only 1 NANO-POWER module is needed for each NANO-EQ system to work.</p>
<p>Estimated size: 4(w)x4(h)x4(d) cm (without connectors);   estimated material: plastic</p>
<p><strong><em>GOAL TO REACH FOR DEVELOPMENT OF THIS MODULE: $110.000</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>The NANO-EQ module</strong> is a basic module which <strong>is responsible to execute the real-time audio filtering and equalization process (7 or more bands equalization, 20Hz - 20KHz range)</strong>; this module can perform audio equalization for 2 audio channels simultaneously.</p>
<p><img alt=""Homogeneous Audio Frequency Bands"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img194.imageshack.us/img194/3372/jusn.png"" src="""" style=""margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;"" title=""Homogeneous Audio Frequency Bands""/></p>
<p>To<strong> create a 2 channel NANO-EQ system</strong> (typical audio stereo application) the NANO-EQ module must be connected to the NANO-POWER module by using the connector on the left panel (see the images above); it is also possible to <strong>create a multi-channel NANO-EQ system</strong> by connecting in a cascade fashion more than one NANO-EQ modules for up to 4 NANO-EQ modules (8 channel NANO-EQ system) by using the same connector.</p>
<p>This module accommodates plenty of connections: <strong>there are one pair of RCA analog input and output connectors for analog audio, one input and output 3.5mm jack for analog audio and one S/PDIF  input and output connector for digital audio</strong>; it is also possible to use a digital input with an analog output and vice versa, or use digital input and output or analog input and ouput.</p>
<p>The NANO-EQ module input connections can manage only uncompressed audio. For compressed audio (such as Dolby or DTS), see the other modules below.</p>
<p>The front expansion connector will be used to connect the bonus module, if the higher goals will be achieved (see below).</p>
<p><strong>Heart of NANO-EQ is a powerful SHARC signal processor with &gt;1200MFLOPs computational power, assisted by best-in-class A/D and D/A converters with Signal-to-Noise-Ratio &gt; 120db.</strong></p>
<p>Estimated size: 8(w)x4(h)x4(d) cm (without connectors);   estimated material: plastic</p>

<h3>The pro modules for who needs environment equalization feature: NANO-PLAYER and NANO-MIC modules</h3>
<p>The NANO-PLAYER and NANO-MIC are two modules needed for the environment equalization feature: <strong>this feature allows you to equalize the sound from your desired listening position, considering the surrounding environment</strong>. For this feature, it is  needed an external microphone to be connected to one of these modules; further improvements could eliminate the need for an external microphone, integrating one directly into one of the modules.</p>
<h3>NANO-PLAYER module</h3>
<p><img alt=""The NANO-PLAYER module, front view"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://imageshack.us/a/img833/5497/kq5r.png"" src="""" style=""margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;"" title=""The NANO-PLAYER module, front view""/></p>

<p><strong>The NANO-PLAYER module is needed only to run the environment equalization feature</strong>; it has a power led on the front panel to indicate normal operation, and has to be connected to the NANO-POWER module by using the male connector on the right panel (on left side of the back view image, see above); the digital S/PDIF out connector has to be connected to the digital S/PDIF input  connector of the NANO-EQ module, using a cable (in this case, your normal audio source must be disconnected from the NANO-EQ modules).</p>
<p>By using the iPhone or Android App, it is possible to run the environment equalization feature: <strong>the NANO-PLAYER will replace your normal audio source to play a predefined audio track for a few seconds while simultaneously the NANO-MIC module will capture the audio signals</strong>, to allow the computation of correct audio equalization.</p>
<p>If your NANO-EQ system has more than 2 channels (so, more than one NANO-EQ modules) the environment equalization feature must be executed one time for each NANO-EQ module present in the system, each time connecting the S/PDIF out of the NANO-PLAYER module to the S/PDIF in of the desired NANO-EQ module (just follows the on-screen advices of the iPhone or Android app).</p>
<p>When the operations are ended, the NANO-PLAYER module can be disconnected from NANO-POWER and NANO-EQ modules and your normal audio source can be reconnected to the NANO-EQ module.</p>
<p>Estimated size: 4(w)x4(h)x4(d) cm (without connectors);   estimated material: plastic</p>
<p><strong><em>GOAL TO REACH FOR DEVELOPMENT OF THIS MODULE: $160.000</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>The NANO-MIC module is needed only to run the environment equalization feature, togheter with the NANO-PLAYER module</strong>; it has a <strong>replaceable battery pack</strong> as power source, with a Power/led button to turn on/off the module on the front panel and a standard input connector on the right panel (left side of the back view image, see above) to connect an external microphone (further improvements could eliminate the need for an external microphone).</p>
<p>This module<strong> integrates a wirelss communication feature</strong>, needed to further synchronize all operations with the iPhone or Android app for the environment equalization feature.</p>
<p>When the operations are started, the NANO-MIC module will captures the audio signals, which will be after sent to the iPhone or Android app to get the correct equalization parameters.</p>
<p>When the operations are ended, the NANO-MIC module can be turned off.</p>

<p><strong>The NANO-DECODER module is specifically designed</strong> to be used in a NANO-EQ system <strong>for Home Cinema applications</strong>: this module has the <strong>feature to decode some Dolby Digital and DTS audio codec</strong> (used in DVD and Blu-Ray discs).</p>
<p>The NANO-DECODER module must be connected to the NANO-POWER module with the connector on the left panel (using a cable); on the front panel it has a power led to indicate normal operation, and at least three S/PDIF out connectors; on the back panel it has one S/PDIF IN connector.</p>
<p>This module <strong>can decode</strong> the most common Home Cinema Sorround codecs, <strong>the Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS 5.1</strong>, by connecting the audio source (typical a DVD or Blu-Ray player) to the S/PDIF IN connector: in this case the S/PDIF OUT connector for channels 1/2 must be connected to the S/PDIF IN connector of the first NANO-EQ module, the S/PDIF OUT connector for channels 3/4 must be connected to the S/PDIF IN connector of the second NANO-EQ module, and the S/PDIF OUT connector for channels 5/6 must be connected to the S/PDIF IN connector of the third NANO-EQ module (because one NANO-EQ module can manage 2 channels, to create a 6 channels NANO-EQ system three NANO-EQ modules must be used in a cascade fashion).</p>
<p><strong>Our target is to include also one HDMI IN and OUT</strong> connectors (see the image above) to allow the NANO-DECODER module <strong>to decode the High Definition audio codecs Dolby TrueHD and DTS HD Master Audio 7.1 channels</strong> for a perfect Home Cinema Entertainment (a fourth S/PDIF OUT connector will be used to transmit channels 7 and 8 to a fourth NANO-EQ module). <strong>Anyway, HDMI with HDCP connections are subject to high costs of annual license: approximately 25.000$ for year, so the HDMI connections will be included only if will be collected many extra funds higher than the last goal: help us!!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Heart of NANO-DECODER is a powerful SHARC signal processor with &gt;1200MFLOPs computational power.</strong></p>
<p>Estimated size: 8(w)x4(h)x4(d) cm (without connectors);   estimated material: plastic</p>
<p><strong><em>GOAL TO REACH FOR DEVELOPMENT OF THIS MODULE: $200.000 (plus great extra funds for licensing costs of HDMI and HD Audio Codecs)</em></strong></p>

The NANO-EQ system is a Digital Audio Equalizer. But ... What is an Audio Equalizer?

An Audio Equalizer is a typical component of a Hi-Fi system for listening to music (but can also be used in Home Cinema systems, if specifically designed), and its purpose is to make the sound more pleasing to the listener according to his musical tastes.
To achieve this goal, an Audio Equalizer divides the sound into several bands (audio components) and enables the listener to give more or less emphasis (through the equalization parameters) to these audio bands, according to his tastes. For example, it allows:

to emphasize some treble to better listen to the voice of the singers;
to emphasize some bass to better listen the sound produced by a guitar or a bass instrument;
and so on ...

In any typical equalizer, the equalization parameters can be changed only on the instrument itself, via buttons or levers to slide.
High-quality equalizers with low distortions may cost hundreds of dollars, while having not very small dimensions.

 
So, What is the NANO-EQ system goal?

The NANO-EQ system goal is to give you:

a high quality Digital Audio Equalizer with 7 bands, or more (so, 7 equalization parameters that can be adjusted independently);
a reasonable low cost;
the feature to be connected to virtually any audio source type (turntables, CD players, DVD players, Blu-Ray players) thanks to the presence of the most common analog and digital connections;
a nice-looking and small packages;
easiness to transport thanks to its small size;
the feature to be able to use it both at home or in a car, thanks to the standard 12V input power connector;
the feature to control your equalization parameters via a simple iPhone or Android App, wireless;
the feature to use it in a Home Cinema system (systems up to 8 channels);
linearize the acoustics of the listening environment, to have a better listening experience.


Why NANO-EQ system?
The NANO-EQ is unique in the world because is designed following a ""get-only-what-you-need"" thought: the NANO-EQ system is composed of many small modules each of which gives you a specific feature; these modules can be connected togheter to compose your personal NANO-EQ system.
In this way, you can drastically reduce the overall size of your equalizations system and save your money if you don't need optional features.
What Are The Advantages Of NANO-EQ system?
There are many advatnages versus the traditional equalizer:


the size: the target is to be able to offer a NANO-EQ 2 channel system (typical for audio stereo applications) by using only two modules in a very small space, estimated in 12x4x4 cm;

the cost: the target is to make available to all consumers a simple NANO-EQ 2 channels system for around 150$, and we hope less (obviously our funders will receive their gifts first, and only some time later will be available a worldwide sale through a web site);

the quality: best in class digital components will be used for the Analog-to-Digital and Digital-to-Analog Audio conversions with 24bit/96KHz sampling rate and Signal-to-Noise-Ratio >120db; a powerful Signal Processor with >1200MFLOPs computational power will be used for Audio filtering and equalization process;

the flexibility: with our extremely modular design, you can get only the modules (so, the features) that you really want, saving your money;

the portability: the NANO-EQ system is powered by a simple 12V adapter, which makes it easy to use at home or in car;

the available input and output connections: the presence of RCA analog connections, 3.5mm jack connections and S/PDIF digital connections, allows it to be connected to virtually any audio source type and audio amplifiers / speakers system;

the environment equalization feature: by using the specific modules and a microphone, you can linearize the acoustisc of the listening environment to have a listen close to perfection (this feature will be available by reaching the higher level goals, please see below);

the home theater sorround feature: by using the specific modules, you can compose an 8 channels NANO-EQ system capable to decode some Dolby and DTS multi-channel codecs (such as Dolby 5.1 and DTS 5.1) without external decoder equipments (this feature will be available by reaching the higher goals, please see below);

the graphic display feature (bonus): by using the specific module, you can have a real-time graphic-style display, which displays in real-time the audio levels with a series of led bars (this feature will be available by reaching the higher level goals, please see below);



Why We Need Your Funds?
It is simply: We need your funds to make our idea and our studies reality!! We want to offer to you the NANO-EQ system because we believe it is a great new piece of technology for audio applications,
BUT
we need your help:
we have developed the idea and selected most of the components with our funds, but now to complete the development process we need to:

The NANO-EQ system in details
The NANO-EQ system is composed of 5 modules plus 1 bonus module (in case all the goals are successfully achieved), each of which gives you a spcific feature: in the followings lines are described all the modules and the goal needed to fully develop them.
The basic modules needed for all: NANO-POWER and NANO-EQ modules
NANO-POWER module

The NANO-POWER module is a basic module with which you can turn on/off the NANO-EQ system and turn on/off the wireless communication feature to save power (or to reduce the RF interferences) when there is no need to change equalization parameters.
This module has a standard connector for receiving the 12V input power needed by the NANO-EQ system to work: the other modules receive the input power by this NANO-POWER module by connecting to the connectors on the left and right panel (see the images above).
Through a simple iPhone or Android application it is possible to communicate with the NANO-POWER module to control and edit the equalization parameters of each audio band available, for each channel of the NANO-EQ system.
Only 1 NANO-POWER module is needed for each NANO-EQ system to work.
Estimated size: 4(w)x4(h)x4(d) cm (without connectors);   estimated material: plastic
GOAL TO REACH FOR DEVELOPMENT OF THIS MODULE: $110.000
 
NANO-EQ module


The NANO-EQ module is a basic module which is responsible to execute the real-time audio filtering and equalization process (7 or more bands equalization, 20Hz - 20KHz range); this module can perform audio equalization for 2 audio channels simultaneously.

To create a 2 channel NANO-EQ system (typical audio stereo application) the NANO-EQ module must be connected to the NANO-POWER module by using the connector on the left panel (see the images above); it is also possible to create a multi-channel NANO-EQ system by connecting in a cascade fashion more than one NANO-EQ modules for up to 4 NANO-EQ modules (8 channel NANO-EQ system) by using the same connector.
This module accommodates plenty of connections: there are one pair of RCA analog input and output connectors for analog audio, one input and output 3.5mm jack for analog audio and one S/PDIF  input and output connector for digital audio; it is also possible to use a digital input with an analog output and vice versa, or use digital input and output or analog input and ouput.
The NANO-EQ module input connections can manage only uncompressed audio. For compressed audio (such as Dolby or DTS), see the other modules below.
The front expansion connector will be used to connect the bonus module, if the higher goals will be achieved (see below).
Heart of NANO-EQ is a powerful SHARC signal processor with >1200MFLOPs computational power, assisted by best-in-class A/D and D/A converters with Signal-to-Noise-Ratio > 120db.
Estimated size: 8(w)x4(h)x4(d) cm (without connectors);   estimated material: plastic
GOAL TO REACH FOR DEVELOPMENT OF THIS MODULE: $110.000

Below you can see an 8 channel NANO-EQ system for sorround application (7.1 typical), compared to an iPhone:

 
 
The pro modules for who needs environment equalization feature: NANO-PLAYER and NANO-MIC modules
The NANO-PLAYER and NANO-MIC are two modules needed for the environment equalization feature: this feature allows you to equalize the sound from your desired listening position, considering the surrounding environment. For this feature, it is  needed an external microphone to be connected to one of these modules; further improvements could eliminate the need for an external microphone, integrating one directly into one of the modules.
NANO-PLAYER module


The NANO-PLAYER module is needed only to run the environment equalization feature; it has a power led on the front panel to indicate normal operation, and has to be connected to the NANO-POWER module by using the male connector on the right panel (on left side of the back view image, see above); the digital S/PDIF out connector has to be connected to the digital S/PDIF input  connector of the NANO-EQ module, using a cable (in this case, your normal audio source must be disconnected from the NANO-EQ modules).
By using the iPhone or Android App, it is possible to run the environment equalization feature: the NANO-PLAYER will replace your normal audio source to play a predefined audio track for a few seconds while simultaneously the NANO-MIC module will capture the audio signals, to allow the computation of correct audio equalization.
If your NANO-EQ system has more than 2 channels (so, more than one NANO-EQ modules) the environment equalization feature must be executed one time for each NANO-EQ module present in the system, each time connecting the S/PDIF out of the NANO-PLAYER module to the S/PDIF in of the desired NANO-EQ module (just follows the on-screen advices of the iPhone or Android app).
When the operations are ended, the NANO-PLAYER module can be disconnected from NANO-POWER and NANO-EQ modules and your normal audio source can be reconnected to the NANO-EQ module.
Estimated size: 4(w)x4(h)x4(d) cm (without connectors);   estimated material: plastic
GOAL TO REACH FOR DEVELOPMENT OF THIS MODULE: $160.000
 
The NANO-MIC module


The NANO-MIC module is needed only to run the environment equalization feature, togheter with the NANO-PLAYER module; it has a replaceable battery pack as power source, with a Power/led button to turn on/off the module on the front panel and a standard input connector on the right panel (left side of the back view image, see above) to connect an external microphone (further improvements could eliminate the need for an external microphone).
This module integrates a wirelss communication feature, needed to further synchronize all operations with the iPhone or Android app for the environment equalization feature.
When the operations are started, the NANO-MIC module will captures the audio signals, which will be after sent to the iPhone or Android app to get the correct equalization parameters.
When the operations are ended, the NANO-MIC module can be turned off.
Estimated size: 4(w)x4(h)x4(d) cm (without connectors);   estimated material: plastic
GOAL TO REACH FOR DEVELOPMENT OF THIS MODULE: $160.000
 
 
The advanced module for who has a Home Cinema system: NANO-DECODER module


The NANO-DECODER module is specifically designed to be used in a NANO-EQ system for Home Cinema applications: this module has the feature to decode some Dolby Digital and DTS audio codec (used in DVD and Blu-Ray discs).
The NANO-DECODER module must be connected to the NANO-POWER module with the connector on the left panel (using a cable); on the front panel it has a power led to indicate normal operation, and at least three S/PDIF out connectors; on the back panel it has one S/PDIF IN connector.
This module can decode the most common Home Cinema Sorround codecs, the Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS 5.1, by connecting the audio source (typical a DVD or Blu-Ray player) to the S/PDIF IN connector: in this case the S/PDIF OUT connector for channels 1/2 must be connected to the S/PDIF IN connector of the first NANO-EQ module, the S/PDIF OUT connector for channels 3/4 must be connected to the S/PDIF IN connector of the second NANO-EQ module, and the S/PDIF OUT connector for channels 5/6 must be connected to the S/PDIF IN connector of the third NANO-EQ module (because one NANO-EQ module can manage 2 channels, to create a 6 channels NANO-EQ system three NANO-EQ modules must be used in a cascade fashion).
Our target is to include also one HDMI IN and OUT connectors (see the image above) to allow the NANO-DECODER module to decode the High Definition audio codecs Dolby TrueHD and DTS HD Master Audio 7.1 channels for a perfect Home Cinema Entertainment (a fourth S/PDIF OUT connector will be used to transmit channels 7 and 8 to a fourth NANO-EQ module). Anyway, HDMI with HDCP connections are subject to high costs of annual license: approximately 25.000$ for year, so the HDMI connections will be included only if will be collected many extra funds higher than the last goal: help us!!
Heart of NANO-DECODER is a powerful SHARC signal processor with >1200MFLOPs computational power.
Estimated size: 8(w)x4(h)x4(d) cm (without connectors);   estimated material: plastic
GOAL TO REACH FOR DEVELOPMENT OF THIS MODULE: $200.000 (plus great extra funds for licensing costs of HDMI and HD Audio Codecs)
 
 
The bonus module: NANO-EQ-GRAPHIC module


The NANO-EQ-GRAPHIC module is a bonus module developed by collecting extra funds over $200.000 threshold.
This module provides you the feature to graphically display the audio levels of each channel, by using a series of led bars. Using the connector present on the back panel, it can be connected to the expansion connector on the front panel of NANO-EQ module.
Estimated size: 8(w)x4(h)x1.5(d) cm (without connectors);   estimated material: plastic
GOAL TO REACH FOR DEVELOPMENT OF THIS MODULE:  >$200.000
 
Below you can see a simple 2 channel NANO-EQ system for stereo application with NANO-EQ-GRAPHIC module, compared to an iPhone:

 
 
What Are The Difficulties?
Our target is to pack in these small sizes, a high level of audio quality and flexibility; we will evaluates thermal heating problems or audio interferences and the best solutions to solve them.
Due to these possibilities, the size or external layout may slightly change for the final products: please come back here to know the latest updates of our NANO-EQ system!
The GOALS: Why $110.000 minimum?
This is the minimum goal we have calculated to allow us to develop the NANO-EQ basic system and ensure the production of all the NANO-EQ gifts for our funders: so, for you!

lowering people's diseases caused by hands hypothermia;
the creation of additional industrial facilities and jobs (our production will be implemented in the United States).
Difficulties in the implementation of the project are associated with the problem of entering a new product on the market. The lack of customs demand at the first stage of the project will be due to the limited advertising budget. We will solve this problem by using such modern means of communication as social networks in an advertising campaign. We believe that social networks will help promote such a healthy and necessary product for all people who live permanently or travel to regions of the planet with a cold climate.
We appeal to everyone who is ready to support our project with a request to place links to this page on their social networks.
Together we will warm the hands of millions!

<p><b>JOURNEY OF DESIGNING Ez Hold</b></p>
<p>Our journey in designing <b>Ez Hold</b> started in <b>December 2014.</b></p>
<p>Having experienced discomfort while using mobiles and feeling the need of having a utility that hold mobile devices, we have come up with <b>Ez Hold. </b>Our experience in <i>Engineering and Rubber industries</i> helped us to design and build <b>Ez Hold</b>.</p>
<p>In <b>March 2015</b>, first Design was completed, after working for many days. And by <b>April 2015</b> our first Prototype was ready. We have achieved success in our first step and started to re-design to fine tune the way the device stands.</p>
<p>During <b>May 2015</b>, after making changes to the earlier design, we made a second prototype to finalize the size, design and outer look of<b> Ez Hold.</b> This has given us confidence that, we can now work for a more refined product.</p>
<p><b>June 2015</b> was the time when we tested our <i>first self-adjustment technique </i>of this holder. We finalized this technique right after the first trial and got the rubber designed for self adjustment. <span>This is where we achieved a major milestone in materializing the design into a product.</span></p>
<p><b>July 2015</b> was when we decided the product should have a 90 degree locking position for a better hold of a mobile device. </p>
<p><b>September 2015</b>, saw the completion of a completely designed product and that is how the device got its name <b>Ez Hold. </b>We decided to enhance <b>Ez Hold by adding an </b><b>Aluminum Caribiner</b> for easy carrying.</p>

JOURNEY OF DESIGNING Ez Hold
Our journey in designing Ez Hold started in December 2014.
Having experienced discomfort while using mobiles and feeling the need of having a utility that hold mobile devices, we have come up with Ez Hold. Our experience in Engineering and Rubber industries helped us to design and build Ez Hold.
In March 2015, first Design was completed, after working for many days. And by April 2015 our first Prototype was ready. We have achieved success in our first step and started to re-design to fine tune the way the device stands.
During May 2015, after making changes to the earlier design, we made a second prototype to finalize the size, design and outer look of Ez Hold. This has given us confidence that, we can now work for a more refined product.
June 2015 was the time when we tested our first self-adjustment technique of this holder. We finalized this technique right after the first trial and got the rubber designed for self adjustment. This is where we achieved a major milestone in materializing the design into a product.
July 2015 was when we decided the product should have a 90 degree locking position for a better hold of a mobile device. 
September 2015, saw the completion of a completely designed product and that is how the device got its name Ez Hold. We decided to enhance Ez Hold by adding an Aluminum Caribiner for easy carrying.
A Look at Ez Hold prototypes after 3D Printing



In October 2015 We started promotions, in that process we made videos exhibiting Uses and Advantages of Ez Hold. We successfully Completed trials with various devices and few surveys to check how the response would be. And we were glad to see a very positive response.

All the PrePromotional activities were completed by November 2015, including our website www.ezhold.in

Now We are ready to Promote and Launch Ez Hold through 
Indiegogo campaign in December 2015.
Starting Massive production and shipment in January & February 2016.
We are ready with a very useful product, designed based on an individual's everyday requirement.
Now, its time for you to join our journey, as a most valuable customer.

The following extremely large devices won´t fit inside the TOCA sleeve: - Samsung Galaxy Tab A 7.0;- Huawei Honor Note 8;- Sony Xperia Z Ultra; Sony Tablet P 3G;- LG Optimus L3 E400; HTC Nexus 9;- Samsung Galaxy C9 Pro or any bigger than (165mm x 82mm). Our suggestion so far: To have a real offline experience with your smartphone - besides taking the battery out - we suggest you activate the Airplane Mode, put inside the Faraday Pocket of your TOCA and fold twice until the magnets closed it. In this way, the smartphone not only stops sending information but also stops receiving information, because the metal fabric blocks* the signals coming from the antennas around you.If our project grows, we want to be able to invest in our own researchers to give you more detailed information about this kind of subject.Thanks for your support!Toca Team!Delivery Timeframes:Orders will begin shipping in December via a fully tracked door-to-door service.",16.0,0,"1 Campaign

trend continues – you’ll have to switch between 20 or even 50 different apps in
order to control your home and still, these apps won’t work together. This
doesn’t sound like the future form the Sci-Fi movies. The solution is one <b>universal platform</b>, one operating

The <i>b</i>OS SDK provides a rich application framework that allows you to build plugins for any device, develop custom logical functions and user interface controls. The SDK is based on C# programming language for .NET and Mono framework. Development can be done in Microsoft Visual Studio or MonoDevelop environment. SDK includes examples to easily implement any communication protocol or to create additional logical functions. Plugins can use existing UI controls or include a custom user interface based on HTML5 and JavaScript. <br/></p><p> For some developers the final results is the prize by itself, but why not make some money on the way. After you’ll be done developing and testing your plugin, you’ll be able to submit it to the <a href=""http://bos.comfortclick.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""http://bridge.comfortclick.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ComfortClick Bridge</a> plugins library. We’ll review the driver and if it will be in compliance with our standards, will publish it.

</h1></div>","The first building operating system (bOS) for your homeComfortClick
bOS is the first building operating system that features building
automation plugins market - ComfortClick
Bridge.  ComfortClick bOS is the
easiest way to set-up a smart home. Select your supported devices from our
growing device library in the ComfortClick Bridge plugins market and control
everything in your home from a single
app on your favorite mobile device. 


Try bOS (User name: User, Password: Pass)
What is ComfortClick bOS? 1. The first building operating system 
Over the years we
have watched the number of home devices increasing almost exponentially. However these
devices are operating independently. You have to get a separate app for each device,
meaning different user experience each time. Now imagine the future, if this
trend continues – you’ll have to switch between 20 or even 50 different apps in
order to control your home and still, these apps won’t work together. This
doesn’t sound like the future form the Sci-Fi movies. The solution is one universal platform, one operating
system, where all devices are working together, in short ComfortClick bOS – the first building operating system.2. One app to rule them all 
With ComfortClick bOS there is no need for switching between
apps to control various devices. Our refined and stylish GUI ensures a unique
user experience that makes control of your environment simple, intuitive and
fun. 
We speak a lot of
languages and are eager to learn more. Choose between a range of supported
devices, systems, standards and manufacturers. Our plugins library keeps
growing rapidly and with the help of our 3rd party developer community we plan
to speed-up the process. The library already features an array of supported
devices  and protocols to choose from
(KNX, Modbus, S BUS, etc.). We really mean it
when we say you’ll be able to control and monitor any electronic device in your
environment via one app from virtually any location.3. The first home automation plugins market  - ComfortClick Bridge 
ComfortClick Bridge

ComfortClick bOS is the first building automation platform
to feature a plugins market – ComfortClick Bridge, where you’ll be able to get plugins for your home devices. ComfortClick Bridge is a device
ready one-stop-shop. It makes smart device set-up and configuration as simple
as plug-and-play.4. Use it with any mobile deviceChoose your favorite smart phone or tablet to control your system. If you’re an Apple fan use iOS application and if you prefer Android use the Android app. The same GUI fits all controlling devices and gives you the same user experience on every platform. 5. Developer communityWe are aware one single company can never cover all the devices that are out there. We’ll offer a playground for 3rd party developer community and give the developers a chance to earn money for their work by selling their plugins in ComfortClick Bridge. Example: integrate your existing Arduino project into bOS and use the advanced logic that ComfortClick bOS offers (schedules, scenes, etc.). 6. No monthly feesNo monthly fees. Pay only for what you need. ComfortClick doesn’t charge a monthly fee, you pay only for devices you want to control. Upgrade or downgrade your existing configuration whenever you want.  Many, many practical applicationsOne universal platform where all devices are working together offers a limitless number of different features. Below are just a few examples:bOS helps you reduce your energy consumption up to 30 %ComfortClick bOS enables you to save energy and reduce the carbon footprint of your home by: 
Automating various everyday tasks, (e.g. when you leave home bOS will turn off the lights, electrical sockets and the reduce the heating)
Monitoring energy consumption.  Accurate information on how much electricity, water or gas gets consumed at any given time leads to energy efficient habits.

Control all devices in your home

Heating / cooling / air-conditioning Alarm

Energy consumption monitoring

Lighting

Audio / video Irrigation

ComfortClick bOS can be used also for commercial buildings (hotels, office buildings, etc.)
We think big – hotels, office buildings, hospitals, etc. We don’t want to limit ourselves to only residential buildings. Automation system offers numerous benefits also for commercial buildings such as office buildings, hotels and hospitals. Imagine coming into a hotel, you already have ComfortClick bOS
on your phone, by entering hotel’s ComfortClick bOS
username and password you’ll be able to control your room. 
ComfortClick bOS for
hotels

How it works?


Install ComfortClick bOS on your computer or get a ComfortClick Hub with
pre-installed bOS
from us. We'll sent you ComfortClick Hub, if you get bOS & hub perk. 


Set-up a configuration of how you want to control your
devices. The process is simple, intuitive and fun. Define multiple devices
scenes, schedules, logical operations (if this, then that). Design your own GUI, use
your own backgrounds, colors and icons or choose from our icons library
and different skins. Upload your configuration and start
enjoying the comfort of your smart home control. 

Simply add new devices whenever you
want. No matter how many devices you’ll add to your ComfortClick bOS
, you
will still be able to control them all from just one application on your
smartphone or tablet.
Developers corner - Have fun and earn some money on the way
Anyone who knows a little bit about programming can start developing plugins for ComfortClick bOS using the bOS software development kit (SDK). The bOS SDK provides a rich application framework that allows you to build plugins for any device, develop custom logical functions and user interface controls. The SDK is based on C# programming language for .NET and Mono framework. Development can be done in Microsoft Visual Studio or MonoDevelop environment. SDK includes examples to easily implement any communication protocol or to create additional logical functions. Plugins can use existing UI controls or include a custom user interface based on HTML5 and JavaScript.  For some developers the final results is the prize by itself, but why not make some money on the way. After you’ll be done developing and testing your plugin, you’ll be able to submit it to the ComfortClick Bridge plugins library. We’ll review the driver and if it will be in compliance with our standards, will publish it. With each purchase of this driver you’ll be making money.Big-players join usAs participants in developer community we see enthusiasts who will decide to develop plugins because they won’t be able to find it on the ComfortClick Bridge. We would also like to invite all hardware manufacturers to join our developer community and have ComfortClick bOS
in mind when they’ll be launching their next great product.Roll-out planWe already have a fully functional software platform, which we have successfully implemented in building automation projects all over the globe. After Indiegogo campaign we’ll finalize ComfortClick Bridge, publish the SDK and offer the Linux version of ComfortClick software platform. We’ll also add a few new plugins (Z-Wave, Hue). By the end of 2014 we plan to expand ComfortClick Bridge plugins library with a number of new plugins  (ZigBee, Nest, Sonos, etc.).Tech Specs

<p>When I was a child, I dreamed to become a hero with super natural power and fight for justice. I love to play hero
role-play game with my neighbors. One of my favorite “power tools” is Slap
Band. When it is straight, it will become a magic sword to fight against bad guys.
When it slaps on my wrist, it will become a magic bracelet acting like a
walkie-talkie to communicate with my ally or a power tool to give me strength.
</p>
<p>Nowadays, technology makes everything come
true. You can always get on line to communicate with people and declare war
with your friends in the online game world with a smart phone.</p>
<p>Once Apple announced to launch their smart
watch products, an idea came into my mind. My “Power Tool” in
childhood can finally come true!<br/></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<h3><b>Concept</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>I create a Protective Case for Apple Watch by
integrating the slap band as Watch Band!</p>
<p>Named as ABCase, you can wear and protect
your Apple Watch as easy as ABC.</p>

<p>In Feb 2015,
we started thinking how to combine the Slap Band with the Protective case into
one unit. Since there was lack of information about Apple Watch dimension, we could only
create the product drawing in our estimation.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434377658/yh7spw9fge0bne3lkdmo.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>There were two main difficulties that we encountered with:</p>
<p>1)<span> 
</span>How to make holes for Apple Watch sensor and make sure the Slap Band is still

</div></div>","Story 
When I was a child, I dreamed to become a hero with super natural power and fight for justice. I love to play hero
role-play game with my neighbors. One of my favorite “power tools” is Slap
Band. When it is straight, it will become a magic sword to fight against bad guys.
When it slaps on my wrist, it will become a magic bracelet acting like a
walkie-talkie to communicate with my ally or a power tool to give me strength.

Nowadays, technology makes everything come
true. You can always get on line to communicate with people and declare war
with your friends in the online game world with a smart phone.
Once Apple announced to launch their smart
watch products, an idea came into my mind. My “Power Tool” in
childhood can finally come true!

Concept

I create a Protective Case for Apple Watch by
integrating the slap band as Watch Band!
Named as ABCase, you can wear and protect
your Apple Watch as easy as ABC.
Draft Drawing

In Feb 2015,
we started thinking how to combine the Slap Band with the Protective case into
one unit. Since there was lack of information about Apple Watch dimension, we could only
create the product drawing in our estimation.There were two main difficulties that we encountered with:
1) 
How to make holes for Apple Watch sensor and make sure the Slap Band is still
workable
2) 
How to secure and protect the Apple Watch 
So, we went ahead for making prototype ABCase “Zero” for evaluation.The Birth of ABCase ""Zero""We started having:
1) 
Metal Stamping Tool for slap band2) 
Prototype Tool for ABCase3) 
3D printing of Apple Watch mockup for testing (Apple Watch was still not yet
launched at that moment)Finally,
ABCase “Zero” came to this world!


Demonstration

Easy to
Install
You can install Apple Watch into ABCase within 10 sec!Easy to
Wear
Comparsion:
You may need to spend over 20 sec to wear Apple Watch with Original Watch Band.It is
easy to slap and go when using ABCase!

Give Protection
Silicon is a kind of very tough and durable material.It is secure and your Apple Watch can be well protected!


One meter Drop Test






No
barrier between Apple Watch and your wrist

The
lighting sensor still works with ABCase!

<p>My name is Aaron Hendon and I have the great idea for an app.</p>
<p>Ever think ""Hey, why isn't there an app for ""<em>this""</em>?  Me too.  So I am doing something about it.  And I need your help. </p>
<p>As much as I want this app to exist, as much as I would love for it to take off and be the next BIG THING, I also really think it would be cool if a whole lot of people could walk around and say that they helped make it happen.</p>
<h3><strong>But What Is It?</strong></h3>
<p>It's a game I have played (in analog) for years - in fact, if you know me then the odds are good that we've played some version of it together (in fact, I got a buck that says we've played it together).  When I show people how to play they continue to play long after I leave.  It is popular for kids and adults, men and women. </p>
<p>It lends itself perfectly to the addictive nature of mobile - and frankly, I am more than happy to exploit this aspect of human nature.  Read about this phenomenon <a href=""http://www.mobilemarketer.com/cms/opinion/columns/13143.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>. </p>
<p>It is a social networking game.  You play it with your own community much the way you play Words With Friends.  It is highly customizable, addictive and there is nothing like it on the market.</p>
<p>There are multiple ways to monetize it - there will be a free and a paid version, with the free version being ad supported, there is an in game currency that can be replenished by buying additional funds and there are multiple add-ons that can be purchased.  </p>
<p>Plus there will be swag you can win commensurate with the level you attain, the highest of which is <strong>BACON</strong>.  Yes, I said it.  This game will have a <strong>BACON LEVEL.  </strong>For many of you that is probably all you need to know.  </p>
<h3>So You Really Aren't Going To Tell Us?</h3>
<p>Unfortunately one cannot protect a cool thought - one cannot patent an idea - and the technological hurdles of building it are tiny for anybody who is already set up to do such a thing.  It is for that reason that I am hesitant to divulge more details here (more about how you can get around this later).  </p>
<p>Also unfortunate is the fact that I am not set up to do anything about this.  I know as much about coding an app as Sarah Palin does about foreign policy (i.e. I can see apps from my phone).</p>
<h3>Do The Math</h3>
<p>Great idea + Easy for someone else to make + Impossible for me to make on my own = I need to raise money to pay someone to code this while not divulging the details until a prototype is rolled out.</p>
<h3>Help Me Help You</h3>
<p>The coders I have spoken with pretty much agree that I can expect to get a good quality prototype for about $20K.  So then the question is can I find enough people to give enough money, sight unseen, to get this rolling?  </p>
<p>I don't know - can I?  Can I get 1,000 people to give $20?  2,000 people to give $10?</p>
<p><strong><em>I think I can!  </em></strong>And with your generous help I am sure to get this rolling.</p>
<h3>Be The First Kid On Your Block</h3>
<p>How cool would it be to actually be a material part of making the next Words with Friends?  And to do so for a mere $10?  Fuggedaboudit!</p>
<p>Not only do you get to make a real and profound difference bringing something into existence that people all over the world will use but you get perks like these:</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Everyone who contributes will be part of the beta roll out.  Not only will you get the prototype to play with but everyone who contributes will get a lifetime supply of the paid version of every itereation forever. You will never have to buy the paid version.  Never.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">At higher contributions you will get significant bonuses of the currency used in the game.  </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Still higher contributions will warrant automatic advances to the highest level of the game.  All contributuions of $500 or more will get a <strong>LIFETIME BACON LEVEL STATUS</strong>.  </p>
<p>There are other <strong>REALLY REALLY GREAT</strong> perks.  </p>
<p><strong>REALLY REALLY GREAT</strong> ones.  </p>
<p><strong>REALLY</strong>.  </p>
<p>Just check them out to the right.</p>
<p>If you are interested in contributing more that $500 you are welcome to contact me directly and we can talk about off menu perks.</p>
<h3>Do You Need More Information?</h3>
<p>Listen, if you must know the details, or you are out to contribute a larger sum, I am happy to send you a Mutual Non Disclosure Agreement and share with you anything you want to know.</p>
<p>However, I really do think that for a $10 investment we can both sleep well knowing you will be DELIGHTED with the outcome of your blind faith.</p>
<h3>The Bottom Line</h3>
<p><strong>I want your money</strong>.  I want you to stop right now and give me at least $10.  More if you feel like it.  And maybe later down the road when you see someone playing the game you can say ""Hey I am one of the founders.  Buy me a drink.""</p>
<p><strong>TELL EVERYONE YOU KNOW about this campaign with everyone</strong>.  Tell everyone you know that some crazy guy is asking for money but not telling anybody exacty what for. For $10 you get to be a part of someone's dream.  </p>
<p>For the record, the initial money will go directly to the programmers.  Any money raised above what is required to develop a working prototype will be set aside for debugging, revisions and marketing.</p>
<h2><strong>THANK YOU!</strong></h2>
<p>I can't thank you enough for even considering such a bizzaro request.  Whether you actually contribute or not, whether you pass this on or just pass on it, the fact that you are still reading is pretty darn flattering and I appreciate your time and interest.</p>

There are multiple ways to monetize it - there will be a free and a paid version, with the free version being ad supported, there is an in game currency that can be replenished by buying additional funds and there are multiple add-ons that can be purchased.  
Plus there will be swag you can win commensurate with the level you attain, the highest of which is BACON.  Yes, I said it.  This game will have a BACON LEVEL.  For many of you that is probably all you need to know.  
So You Really Aren't Going To Tell Us?
Unfortunately one cannot protect a cool thought - one cannot patent an idea - and the technological hurdles of building it are tiny for anybody who is already set up to do such a thing.  It is for that reason that I am hesitant to divulge more details here (more about how you can get around this later).  
Also unfortunate is the fact that I am not set up to do anything about this.  I know as much about coding an app as Sarah Palin does about foreign policy (i.e. I can see apps from my phone).
Do The Math
Great idea + Easy for someone else to make + Impossible for me to make on my own = I need to raise money to pay someone to code this while not divulging the details until a prototype is rolled out.
Help Me Help You
The coders I have spoken with pretty much agree that I can expect to get a good quality prototype for about $20K.  So then the question is can I find enough people to give enough money, sight unseen, to get this rolling?  
I don't know - can I?  Can I get 1,000 people to give $20?  2,000 people to give $10?
I think I can!  And with your generous help I am sure to get this rolling.
Be The First Kid On Your Block
How cool would it be to actually be a material part of making the next Words with Friends?  And to do so for a mere $10?  Fuggedaboudit!
Not only do you get to make a real and profound difference bringing something into existence that people all over the world will use but you get perks like these:
Everyone who contributes will be part of the beta roll out.  Not only will you get the prototype to play with but everyone who contributes will get a lifetime supply of the paid version of every itereation forever. You will never have to buy the paid version.  Never.
At higher contributions you will get significant bonuses of the currency used in the game.  
Still higher contributions will warrant automatic advances to the highest level of the game.  All contributuions of $500 or more will get a LIFETIME BACON LEVEL STATUS.  
There are other REALLY REALLY GREAT perks.  
REALLY REALLY GREAT ones.  
REALLY.  
Just check them out to the right.
If you are interested in contributing more that $500 you are welcome to contact me directly and we can talk about off menu perks.
Do You Need More Information?
Listen, if you must know the details, or you are out to contribute a larger sum, I am happy to send you a Mutual Non Disclosure Agreement and share with you anything you want to know.
However, I really do think that for a $10 investment we can both sleep well knowing you will be DELIGHTED with the outcome of your blind faith.
The Bottom Line
I want your money.  I want you to stop right now and give me at least $10.  More if you feel like it.  And maybe later down the road when you see someone playing the game you can say ""Hey I am one of the founders.  Buy me a drink.""
TELL EVERYONE YOU KNOW about this campaign with everyone.  Tell everyone you know that some crazy guy is asking for money but not telling anybody exacty what for. For $10 you get to be a part of someone's dream.  
For the record, the initial money will go directly to the programmers.  Any money raised above what is required to develop a working prototype will be set aside for debugging, revisions and marketing.
THANK YOU!
I can't thank you enough for even considering such a bizzaro request.  Whether you actually contribute or not, whether you pass this on or just pass on it, the fact that you are still reading is pretty darn flattering and I appreciate your time and interest.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>TAB IT (patent pending) can be used to track any IOU and split bills automatically, without ever having to take out your wallet.  Whether you’re hitting the town with friends, on a business trip with colleagues, or planning a family vacation TAB IT allows you to easily keep track of your debts so that you always know what is owed to you (or what you owe).</p>
<p>The uses for this app are endless!  The user interface allows you to keep track of  what you owe and what others owe you.  Simply enter an amount into the dashboard where you can provide a geotag and photo to help you remember what the IOU is for - add a description and send it to the other party for approval.  When an IOU is approved, the app updates your running balance and you can track what you owe and what is owed you. This not only allows you to reconcile debts easily among yourself and other parties, but it also allows you to track IOU's over time to get a robust picture of your financial behavior.  Because your TABIT credits are verified, you can “Sell Credit” between parties. (This is a great way to reconcile debts you have in-app without having to trade cash back and forth).  The TAB IT Multi-tab function allows you to effortlessly split a bill amongst a group of friends while still providing the opportunity for modifications if there are differences in what each party owes.</p>

<br/><p>TAB IT allows users to confirm or deny debts sent to them via in­app verification system, thusly certifying each debt as accurate and legitimate. Further, TAB IT allows users to “sell” debts owed them to other users in order to settle debts between parties. Users can add additional incentives to “sweeten” the debt sale. For example: If Party A agrees that he/she owes Party B $10, Party B can then trade Party A’s $10 debt to Party C to pay off a debt between Party B and Party C.</p>
<p>This innovative, social debt calculating app makes keeping track of what you owe and what is owed to you easy, mobile and fun! It’s a great way to keep track of all those little debts within a social circle ­that add up to hundreds of lost dollars every year ­ without having to keep track of paper receipts or debate back and forth with your friends who paid for what, when. It’s also a great tool to help teach teenagers and young adults how credit and debt works and to help them become responsible spenders as they enter the financial world.</p>
<p>TAB IT allows users to:</p>
<p>●  Interact with an easy to use, clean looking user interface</p>
<p>●  Add notes and photos of receipts to your TAB IT tabs</p>
<p>●  Connect to Facebook and share TAB IT with friends</p>
<p>●  Invite friends to TAB IT</p>
<p>●  Use TAB IT to teach teenagers and young adults how credit and debt works</p>
<p>●  Send and receive “tabs” from anyone via data services built into the app</p>

6 month ago we created and patented TAB IT , A really cool and new debt and credit tracking system (full description below). However we made some mistakes in the UI leading to a bit of userfriendliness issues (sign up process annoying). Also a tight budget did not allow a thorough marketing strategy so people did not get how amazing this app is, how it simplifies your life and relations, how it puts you in a condition where you do not need to think about any money interactions with your friends but only enjoy their company. TAB IT works in the background to have everything clear, precise and honest.

TAB IT puts annoying cash cash interaction in a well organized limbo!!!

We would like to fix this few flaws add a cool extra function to make it perfect.
