<p></p>
<p>R-U-MAD™ stands for the Revolutionary Ultimate Mixed Martial Arts Dummy™  Patent Application Number GB1502559.6. </p>
<p>My name is Ronnie Smith, I
have thirty years’ experience in the fighting &amp; combat arts and have been an instructor
for twenty years.  </p>
<p>As an independent designer
for twenty years, I work in conjunction with other companies who provide the
necessary skills required to fulfil any projects potential. </p>
<p></p>
<p>In training, I was known
as the mauler or I ron for iron; this was due to my heavy handedness. I did not
like the nicknames because it was never my intent to hurt anyone while training.
</p>
<p>Back in the eighties and nineties, I used to think wouldn’t it be
good if we had robots to train with.  </p>
<p>Then came the grappling dummies,
which are great but without going into too much detail, they lacked some basic abilities
for all round fighting &amp; training and like the punch bag, seemed more
focused on a certain type of fighting style. I still found myself longing for my
robot.</p>
<p>Then one day whilst training,
as I was going from the punch bag to the grappling dummy to the wooden Dummy, which
we in the fighting arts use for blocking conditioning of the arms and legs, it
came to me. </p>
<p>If I put all three
together into one product, I could have my robot, the next best thing to an actual
training partner; and it would never complain or get hurt and that is how  the Revolutionary Ultimate Mixed Martial Arts Dummy™ was born.  </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1409566/files/20150423112745-RUMAD_FULL_F_1.png?1429813665"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""/><br/></p>

statement but here is why I believe it is true when compared to today’s punch
bag &amp; grappling dummies.</p>
<p>R-U-MAD™ is an all in one
multi-functional, multi combinational punch bag and grappling dummy. What makes
it unique is its patent pending detachable parts, which allow the R-U-MAD™ to
transform from a normal punch bag dummy, into a full-bodied grappling dummy.
What’s more, because of its patent pending joint system, the robust joints move
almost human like with a smooth rotational movement and with the patent pending
tension and resistance system, an adjustable stiffness and resistance can be
applied.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1409580/files/20150423113327-RUMAD_AFV_1A.png?1429814007"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

pending stand is designed to allow use not just as a standard punch bag stand,
but it too has detachable parts that allow for multi uses; from a standard
punch bag stand to a grappling dummy throwing stand. It is designed to allow
the full-bodied grappling dummy to be hit with high and low kicks, as its
design keeps the dummy at a distance away from the base of the stand, unlike
the normal punch bag stands that place the dummy over its centre.</span></p>

also designed to store free weights at its base and has retractable and
lockable wheels that allow for push and pull wrestling type training, which is
aided by removing or adding the free weights that are able to be stored on its
base. And if that’s not enough to allow me to call it revolutionary and
ultimate, it may also comes with storage space.</span><br/></p>

<br/>
<p><b>All drawings are for illustration purposes only and do not represent the exact look of the finished product. </b><br/></p><p>Oh and one
final important point, the R-U-MAD™ is able to be sold as an all in one unit or
in separate parts, due to the fact the arms are designed to work with other
punch bag dummies and the stand is designed to be used with other grappling
dummies. Meaning the arms can be sold as a single item, the stand can be sold
on its own, the grappling dummy is for use with or without the stand and so may
also be sold separately, and the body and stand may be sold as one unit, as a
punch bag dummy without the arms and legs. 
</p>
<p>I hope that
is enough to convince you that it is a truly revolutionary and ultimate
product. </p>

<p><b>All drawings are for illustration purposes only and do not represent the exact look of the finished product. </b><br/></p><p>Here at R-U-MAD™ we are
dedicated and determined to design, develop and produce the ultimate all in one hybrid
punch bag &amp; grappling dummy.</p>
<p>We have identified a void
in the market, created by the rise of the mixed martial arts market.  </p>
<p>We do not say this to
criticize but to merely point out the great opportunity this market offers to
innovation and design, I designed the R-U-MAD™ to fill this void.</p>
<p>Market research suggests
it is long overdue, that the merge between grappling dummy and punch bag be made
properly; as the market is crying out for the equipment in this area to be more
suited to the martial artist of the 21st century. </p>
<p>I hope I have begun that
innovation step with the Revolutionary Ultimate Mixed Martial Arts Dummy™</p>
<p><b><u>Here is a quick summary of how it works.  </u></b></p>
<p>By designing detachable
parts, the R-U-MAD™ is able to transform from a fully functional grappling
dummy into a punch bag dummy.</p>
<p>Simply detach the arms and
legs from the fully functional grappling dummy, place the head and body on the
stand and the R-U-MAD™ is now a punch bag.</p>
<p>With the R-U-MAD™ in punch
bag mode, you can also attach arms and/ or legs whilst on the stand.</p>
<p>By designing the R-U-MAD
joints system ™ that mimic the human body joint movement, the fully functional
grappling dummy has the ability to have its joints locked and twisted, as if
they were human joints.</p>
<p>The R-U-MAD stand ™ is
designed with a removable arm that allows the arm to be used in two positions,
one for throwing and one for striking.</p>
<p>The stand and dummy are
also designed to allow the dummy to be attached or removed from the stand.  This means the user can go from a full
body-grappling dummy on the floor, to a free standing-grappling dummy, and
because of the lockable retractable wheels, the user is able to wrestle,
grapple, and throw the dummy while it is standing upright.</p>
<p>After extensive research, design, development, engineering and testing, we have been
able to turn an idea into a working prototype. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1409635/files/20150423115332-RUMAD_AOFV_1A.png?1429815212"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b>All drawings are for illustration purposes only and do not represent the exact look of the finished product. </b><br/></p><p>The detachable arms used
in the demonstration video are called the Revolutionary Ultimate Mixed Martial
Arts Dummy arms™. They are a part of the R-U-MAD™ range; however, they have the
ability to be used with other makes of similar type punch bag dummies.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">We are extremely excited
about R-U-MAD™ and hope you will be to.</span><br/></p>
<p>Currently, there is
nothing on the market that offers the flexibility and multi functionality of
R-U-MAD™.</p>
<p><b>Now we need you to help us
</b>bring the world’s first Revolutionary Ultimate Mixed Martial Arts Dummy™ to
market, starting with Phase 1.</p>
<p><b><u>What is Phase 1?</u></b></p>
<p>With the crowd funding
communities help, I hope to take the design and create the punch bag/grappling
dummies of the future, where fighting/martial arts practitioners of all genres
can practice some of the more painful moves at full strength repeatedly,
without risk of injury to their training partners.</p>
<p>Depending on how much
money is raised from crowd funding, the design and production of R-U-MAD™ may
take two or more phases to reach its ultimate goal.</p>
<p><b>Phase 1’s</b>
route to market may be to design and develop the Revolutionary Ultimate Mixed
Martial Arts Dummy arms™ first.</p>
<p>For the following reasons:
the cost to develop and produce the arms is lower than that of the fully
functional grappling dummy at this stage, the lead-time for design to
production is quicker and the market potential is vast with the millions of
punch bag dummies already been sold worldwide. This will allow cash flow projections
to be achieved at a faster pace, while allowing for time in R &amp; D on the
more complex fully functional version.</p>
<p><b>I have covered the first
stage attorney filing cost</b> of £4,500 along with the £3,000 cost for the first
two types of prototyping for Phase 1.</p>
<p>Which are <b>Visual prototype</b> - This type of
prototype conveys the overall shape and size of the product but does not
usually prove the function of the idea. It is not designed to represent the
materials or production methods of a final mass produced product.</p>
<p>And <b>Proof of concept prototype</b>. - A prototype that demonstrates the
main functionality of the idea. This type of prototype will probably make use
of ‘off the shelf’ components and is unlikely to look like the final product.</p>
<p><b><u>How can you help</u></b></p>
<p></p>
<p>You can take part in our
project simply by sharing it on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest etc. It
will mean a lot to us. If we gather and meet the funding goal, we can all bring
this project into reality.</p>
<p>Your pledge makes
everything possible. 100% of the money raised will go towards finishing phase 1
&amp; starting phase 2. </p>
<p>The minimum target
Investment required is <b>£3,000 = $4,673</b></p><p> The maximum target investment for all of phase 1 is <b>£18,670 = $29,084 </b>.</p>
<p>This is what is required
to kick-start the revolution and begin the journey towards taking full
advantage of and filling the void in the market. </p>

R-U-MAD™ stands for the Revolutionary Ultimate Mixed Martial Arts Dummy™  Patent Application Number GB1502559.6. 
My name is Ronnie Smith, I
have thirty years’ experience in the fighting & combat arts and have been an instructor
for twenty years.  
As an independent designer
for twenty years, I work in conjunction with other companies who provide the
necessary skills required to fulfil any projects potential. 

In training, I was known
as the mauler or I ron for iron; this was due to my heavy handedness. I did not
like the nicknames because it was never my intent to hurt anyone while training.

Back in the eighties and nineties, I used to think wouldn’t it be
good if we had robots to train with.  
Then came the grappling dummies,
which are great but without going into too much detail, they lacked some basic abilities
for all round fighting & training and like the punch bag, seemed more
focused on a certain type of fighting style. I still found myself longing for my
robot.
Then one day whilst training,
as I was going from the punch bag to the grappling dummy to the wooden Dummy, which
we in the fighting arts use for blocking conditioning of the arms and legs, it
came to me. 
If I put all three
together into one product, I could have my robot, the next best thing to an actual
training partner; and it would never complain or get hurt and that is how  the Revolutionary Ultimate Mixed Martial Arts Dummy™ was born.  
All drawings are for illustration purposes only and do not represent the exact look of the finished product. The Revolutionary Ultimate Mixed Martial Arts Dummy™ is a bold
statement but here is why I believe it is true when compared to today’s punch
bag & grappling dummies.
R-U-MAD™ is an all in one
multi-functional, multi combinational punch bag and grappling dummy. What makes
it unique is its patent pending detachable parts, which allow the R-U-MAD™ to
transform from a normal punch bag dummy, into a full-bodied grappling dummy.
What’s more, because of its patent pending joint system, the robust joints move
almost human like with a smooth rotational movement and with the patent pending
tension and resistance system, an adjustable stiffness and resistance can be
applied.



All drawings are for illustration purposes only and do not represent the exact look of the finished product. The patent
pending stand is designed to allow use not just as a standard punch bag stand,
but it too has detachable parts that allow for multi uses; from a standard
punch bag stand to a grappling dummy throwing stand. It is designed to allow
the full-bodied grappling dummy to be hit with high and low kicks, as its
design keeps the dummy at a distance away from the base of the stand, unlike
the normal punch bag stands that place the dummy over its centre.

All drawings are for illustration purposes only and do not represent the exact look of the finished product. The stand is
also designed to store free weights at its base and has retractable and
lockable wheels that allow for push and pull wrestling type training, which is
aided by removing or adding the free weights that are able to be stored on its
base. And if that’s not enough to allow me to call it revolutionary and
ultimate, it may also comes with storage space.



All drawings are for illustration purposes only and do not represent the exact look of the finished product. Oh and one
final important point, the R-U-MAD™ is able to be sold as an all in one unit or
in separate parts, due to the fact the arms are designed to work with other
punch bag dummies and the stand is designed to be used with other grappling
dummies. Meaning the arms can be sold as a single item, the stand can be sold
on its own, the grappling dummy is for use with or without the stand and so may
also be sold separately, and the body and stand may be sold as one unit, as a
punch bag dummy without the arms and legs. 

I hope that
is enough to convince you that it is a truly revolutionary and ultimate
product. 

All drawings are for illustration purposes only and do not represent the exact look of the finished product. Here at R-U-MAD™ we are
dedicated and determined to design, develop and produce the ultimate all in one hybrid
punch bag & grappling dummy.
We have identified a void
in the market, created by the rise of the mixed martial arts market.  
We do not say this to
criticize but to merely point out the great opportunity this market offers to
innovation and design, I designed the R-U-MAD™ to fill this void.
Market research suggests
it is long overdue, that the merge between grappling dummy and punch bag be made
properly; as the market is crying out for the equipment in this area to be more
suited to the martial artist of the 21st century. 
I hope I have begun that
innovation step with the Revolutionary Ultimate Mixed Martial Arts Dummy™
Here is a quick summary of how it works.  
By designing detachable
parts, the R-U-MAD™ is able to transform from a fully functional grappling
dummy into a punch bag dummy.
Simply detach the arms and
legs from the fully functional grappling dummy, place the head and body on the
stand and the R-U-MAD™ is now a punch bag.
With the R-U-MAD™ in punch
bag mode, you can also attach arms and/ or legs whilst on the stand.
By designing the R-U-MAD
joints system ™ that mimic the human body joint movement, the fully functional
grappling dummy has the ability to have its joints locked and twisted, as if
they were human joints.
The R-U-MAD stand ™ is
designed with a removable arm that allows the arm to be used in two positions,
one for throwing and one for striking.
The stand and dummy are
also designed to allow the dummy to be attached or removed from the stand.  This means the user can go from a full
body-grappling dummy on the floor, to a free standing-grappling dummy, and
because of the lockable retractable wheels, the user is able to wrestle,
grapple, and throw the dummy while it is standing upright.
After extensive research, design, development, engineering and testing, we have been
able to turn an idea into a working prototype. 


All drawings are for illustration purposes only and do not represent the exact look of the finished product. The detachable arms used
in the demonstration video are called the Revolutionary Ultimate Mixed Martial
Arts Dummy arms™. They are a part of the R-U-MAD™ range; however, they have the
ability to be used with other makes of similar type punch bag dummies.
We are extremely excited
about R-U-MAD™ and hope you will be to.
Currently, there is
nothing on the market that offers the flexibility and multi functionality of
R-U-MAD™.
Now we need you to help us
bring the world’s first Revolutionary Ultimate Mixed Martial Arts Dummy™ to
market, starting with Phase 1.
What is Phase 1?
With the crowd funding
communities help, I hope to take the design and create the punch bag/grappling
dummies of the future, where fighting/martial arts practitioners of all genres
can practice some of the more painful moves at full strength repeatedly,
without risk of injury to their training partners.
Depending on how much
money is raised from crowd funding, the design and production of R-U-MAD™ may
take two or more phases to reach its ultimate goal.
Phase 1’s
route to market may be to design and develop the Revolutionary Ultimate Mixed
Martial Arts Dummy arms™ first.
For the following reasons:
the cost to develop and produce the arms is lower than that of the fully
functional grappling dummy at this stage, the lead-time for design to
production is quicker and the market potential is vast with the millions of
punch bag dummies already been sold worldwide. This will allow cash flow projections
to be achieved at a faster pace, while allowing for time in R & D on the
more complex fully functional version.
I have covered the first
stage attorney filing cost of £4,500 along with the £3,000 cost for the first
two types of prototyping for Phase 1.
Which are Visual prototype - This type of
prototype conveys the overall shape and size of the product but does not
usually prove the function of the idea. It is not designed to represent the
materials or production methods of a final mass produced product.
And Proof of concept prototype. - A prototype that demonstrates the
main functionality of the idea. This type of prototype will probably make use
of ‘off the shelf’ components and is unlikely to look like the final product.
How can you help

You can take part in our
project simply by sharing it on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest etc. It
will mean a lot to us. If we gather and meet the funding goal, we can all bring
this project into reality.
Your pledge makes
everything possible. 100% of the money raised will go towards finishing phase 1
& starting phase 2. 
The minimum target
Investment required is £3,000 = $4,673 The maximum target investment for all of phase 1 is £18,670 = $29,084 .
This is what is required
to kick-start the revolution and begin the journey towards taking full
advantage of and filling the void in the market. 
Below is what we will
spend your donations on for phase 1 
Investment
The next 6 months of phase 1 Prototyping 
Presentation prototype. - This type of prototype combines the functionality
of the product with the overall appearance, often using bespoke parts. It is
likely that production grade materials will be used. 
At a cost of £3000
Pre-Production prototype. - This type of prototype builds on the work of a
presentation prototype, by fully considering mass production manufacturing
methods and production. The parts are likely to be created using production
methods and materials. 
At a cost of £5000.

If we reach £25,000 plus,
we will reach the minimum production requirements for phase 1.
If we reach £30,000, then
we can start phase 2 which is the fully functional Revolutionary Ultimate Mixed
Martial Arts Dummy™. We will begin with a Proof
of concept prototype. 
Then if we reach £35,000
we can move on to the Presentation
prototype. 
If we reach £45,000 plus,
we can then move on to the Pre-Production
prototype.
If we reach £50,000 plus
we will begin phase 2 patent procedures which is an international (PCT) patent
application.
R-U-MAD™ has all relevant
protection with patents pending in the following areas, with international
patents to be filed as part of phase 2 in the near future.

€150 AMUCHI (Personalized Mochila Bags)



Model: Ariana von Bandemer
Photographer: Oliver Ajkovic




The rich cultural heritage of the Wayuu is carefully
woven into each mochila. These bags are crocheted by hand through traditional techniques that have been passed on from generation to generation. The process can take over a month to complete, resulting in a object that is not just a bag, but a reflection of deeply rooted traditions and values.

On the surface the bucket-shaped mochila features bold and bright patterns that are designed by the Wayuu people. Each mochila has a unique, natural and bohemian appeal. 
A sturdy shoulder strap makes the bag a
functional item that is convenient for both work and leisure use. You can choose the colors of the pattern so is 100% personalized!The livelihood of the Wayuu people depends on the production of the mochila. The Wayuu community consists of generations of artisans that are rarely recognized for their skills and hard work, and as a result often live in impoverished conditions. By purchasing this item, you are recognizing the value of their artistry, and ultimately extending support to the community.

150€ AMUCHI (Personalisierte Mochila Taschen)
Das Wissen und die Technik eine Mochila zu weben wird von Generation zu Generation weitergegeben. Der Prozess des Webens kosten pro Tasche ca. einen ganzen Monat täglicher Arbeit. 
Eine Mochila ist nicht einfach nur eine Tasche, sie zeigt eine tiefverwurzelte Tradition und die Werte der Menschen der Wayuu. 
Auch hier werden mit besonderen Mustern und Farben gearbeitet, doch speziell für dieses Crowdfunding-Event haben wir realisiert, dass 25 Taschen in der Farbe frei wählbar sind. Ihr könnt entscheiden mit welchen Farben ihr eure Taschen gerne hättet – sie sind so 100 % personalisiert!
Ihr unterstützt mit dem Kauf dieser Tasche die Existenz der Wayuu.

<p style=""text-align: center;"">_______________________________________________________________</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">FROM SICKNESS TO SUCCESS</h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A little over 11 years ago I moved to Temecula and was hired to work as a sales manager for a construction equipment company. Toward the end of my first year I was injured on a jobsite that ultimately left me disabled and unable to work or sometimes even walk. I had injured my spine and going through over a year of seeing different doctors, attempting ways to try and cure the injury and control the pain, nothing was working; I had tried every neuropathic pain medication known to man and refused to take any type of narcotic pain medications fearing it would only add to my problems.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">After three years of testing, hoping and praying I was finally diagnosed with a plethora of autoimmune diseases that were exacerbated by the spinal injury. To name a few, Lupus, Sjogren's, and Fibromylagia as well as moderate osteoarthritis and bone spurs on my neck and spine. My neuro-surgeon said he wouldn't touch me with a 10 foot pole because doing surgery on me ""would be disastrous"". It didn't sound very hopeful... There was and is no cure for any of it. The only hope that I had was trusting in God and giving it over to the Lord. </p>
<h4><br/></h4>
<h4><i>Feeling so scared, I still went into a serious depression...</i></h4>
<div><br/></div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">So many days that I could not walk or even get out of bed left me feeling worthless and hopeless, and especially to my family that depended on me. I was always a very active woman and to say the least, an absolute go-getter. In June of 2009 I often tried to go for short walks with my pups to get out for some fresh air....as we were walking one day I remember thinking that it was really difficult carrying my cell phone, my ID and my keys in one hand and a cane in the other, all while holding 2 leashes attached to my little dogs. After several walks I started to realize that I needed something that was lightweight and of course ""fashionable"" that I could carry these little necessities in. I searched for a couple of months looking on all the designers sites as well as many other online accessory sites, looking for something other than a plain black leather belt pouch or a hot pink neoprene phone bag.</div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Finally giving up on my search, one day I searched through my closet looking for something to cut up that I could make into something that I could use. I found a little black patent leather drawstring bag. I cut it into a rectangle shaped piece about 10"" x 4"", folded it in half and stapled it together. I then tied a dog leash snap lock to it so that I could hang it on a belt loop or the strap of my dresses and voila! There I had it! Wherever I went I received so many compliments and had friends asking me to make some for them in various fabrics and colors... they told their friends who told their friends and I was amazed at the response!</span><br/>

</div><div style=""text-align: center;"">
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">THE MIRACLE</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">After a few weeks of this I started to think... This could be a business....I decided to take it a step further and took a dozen or so of these little bags that I had made over to a beautiful upscale boutique in town and presented them to the owner. She went crazy and insisted that I get this patented... She really scared me! I thought to myself ""I really have to do something before this gets out"". I didn't have the strength or energy to do this... How would this at all be possible? I prayed about it and thought to myself... I have no money, my husband lost his job and I had to battle with my long term disability every year to maintain my benefits. How could I possibly do this? And well, there was also the fact that the President of the United States was on TV stating that we were on the brink of a depression... I thought I could never make it. All I had was my monthly disability check that was $4000...Those funds were supposed to be used to pay the house payment, the car payment and the utilities that were due. I took the chance and used those funds to move forward...</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In September 2009, I filed for my patent on the Original B Bag, started my company and sold about $5000 in the first month, recouped the $4000, was left with $1000 working capital and then November - December 2009, I sold $12,000; this was with no sales representatives or showrooms, only referrals and my family working for me and helping me make my bags. All of my B Bags and handbags were named after my children, grandchildren and scripture. In November of 2010 we sold almost $80,000 in just that month. I was then branded by Swarovski to be an exclusive Swarovski branded product.  </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">__________________________________________________________________</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><b>RECORD BREAKING SALES </b></h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The company exploded and had record breaking sales... 2010 - Our first full year in business we sold close to a quarter of a million dollars and then came 2011, ending with close to half of a million dollars in revenue. Magazine articles, a celebrity following and the line was all the buzz! Even voted Top Hottest Teen Brands!</p>

<h3>SET BACK</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">And then came 2012... more than 100 retailers that carried the line closed their doors and went out of business. Sales went from nearly half of a million dollars in 2011, to just over $120,000 in 2012 and less than half of that in 2013.  And to add salt to the wound, one of my very own nationwide representatives took the B Bag to China to replicate it in faux leathers and plastic crystals. Once leaked, the B Bag replica was sold all over the world at every airport and casino. I still kept the fire burning for my company and refused to let it get me down.</span><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">_______________________________________________________________</span></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">NEVER GIVE UP</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In January 2013 I decided to take a step back and went to work full time in a completely different industry working only part time for my company and hoping for the economy to heal... I always prayed for direction and finally, in September 2014, I came back to working full time for my company and have been so blessed to have an average of $10,000 in sales monthly since then. These sales are only obtained through emails and phone calls...</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Thankful that I NEVER gave up, it is now time to get back to presenting the line at the major market venues and let the world see the brand new LisaBerck designs. The line has grown to be much more than just the B Bag; some of our top selling handbags are the Suraya fringe crossbody bag... And our convertible foldover crossbody tote. </p>

After three years of testing, hoping and praying I was finally diagnosed with a plethora of autoimmune diseases that were exacerbated by the spinal injury. To name a few, Lupus, Sjogren's, and Fibromylagia as well as moderate osteoarthritis and bone spurs on my neck and spine. My neuro-surgeon said he wouldn't touch me with a 10 foot pole because doing surgery on me ""would be disastrous"". It didn't sound very hopeful... There was and is no cure for any of it. The only hope that I had was trusting in God and giving it over to the Lord. 

Feeling so scared, I still went into a serious depression...

So many days that I could not walk or even get out of bed left me feeling worthless and hopeless, and especially to my family that depended on me. I was always a very active woman and to say the least, an absolute go-getter. In June of 2009 I often tried to go for short walks with my pups to get out for some fresh air....as we were walking one day I remember thinking that it was really difficult carrying my cell phone, my ID and my keys in one hand and a cane in the other, all while holding 2 leashes attached to my little dogs. After several walks I started to realize that I needed something that was lightweight and of course ""fashionable"" that I could carry these little necessities in. I searched for a couple of months looking on all the designers sites as well as many other online accessory sites, looking for something other than a plain black leather belt pouch or a hot pink neoprene phone bag.

Finally giving up on my search, one day I searched through my closet looking for something to cut up that I could make into something that I could use. I found a little black patent leather drawstring bag. I cut it into a rectangle shaped piece about 10"" x 4"", folded it in half and stapled it together. I then tied a dog leash snap lock to it so that I could hang it on a belt loop or the strap of my dresses and voila! There I had it! Wherever I went I received so many compliments and had friends asking me to make some for them in various fabrics and colors... they told their friends who told their friends and I was amazed at the response!

__________________________________________________________________



THE MIRACLE
After a few weeks of this I started to think... This could be a business....I decided to take it a step further and took a dozen or so of these little bags that I had made over to a beautiful upscale boutique in town and presented them to the owner. She went crazy and insisted that I get this patented... She really scared me! I thought to myself ""I really have to do something before this gets out"". I didn't have the strength or energy to do this... How would this at all be possible? I prayed about it and thought to myself... I have no money, my husband lost his job and I had to battle with my long term disability every year to maintain my benefits. How could I possibly do this? And well, there was also the fact that the President of the United States was on TV stating that we were on the brink of a depression... I thought I could never make it. All I had was my monthly disability check that was $4000...Those funds were supposed to be used to pay the house payment, the car payment and the utilities that were due. I took the chance and used those funds to move forward...
In September 2009, I filed for my patent on the Original B Bag, started my company and sold about $5000 in the first month, recouped the $4000, was left with $1000 working capital and then November - December 2009, I sold $12,000; this was with no sales representatives or showrooms, only referrals and my family working for me and helping me make my bags. All of my B Bags and handbags were named after my children, grandchildren and scripture. In November of 2010 we sold almost $80,000 in just that month. I was then branded by Swarovski to be an exclusive Swarovski branded product.  
__________________________________________________________________
RECORD BREAKING SALES 
The company exploded and had record breaking sales... 2010 - Our first full year in business we sold close to a quarter of a million dollars and then came 2011, ending with close to half of a million dollars in revenue. Magazine articles, a celebrity following and the line was all the buzz! Even voted Top Hottest Teen Brands!

SET BACK
And then came 2012... more than 100 retailers that carried the line closed their doors and went out of business. Sales went from nearly half of a million dollars in 2011, to just over $120,000 in 2012 and less than half of that in 2013.  And to add salt to the wound, one of my very own nationwide representatives took the B Bag to China to replicate it in faux leathers and plastic crystals. Once leaked, the B Bag replica was sold all over the world at every airport and casino. I still kept the fire burning for my company and refused to let it get me down.
_______________________________________________________________
NEVER GIVE UP
In January 2013 I decided to take a step back and went to work full time in a completely different industry working only part time for my company and hoping for the economy to heal... I always prayed for direction and finally, in September 2014, I came back to working full time for my company and have been so blessed to have an average of $10,000 in sales monthly since then. These sales are only obtained through emails and phone calls...
Thankful that I NEVER gave up, it is now time to get back to presenting the line at the major market venues and let the world see the brand new LisaBerck designs. The line has grown to be much more than just the B Bag; some of our top selling handbags are the Suraya fringe crossbody bag... And our convertible foldover crossbody tote.

Our products are made of the finest materials and are hand crafted by skilled artisans who meticulously make each and every item, one by one. No two pieces will be exactly alike. With the variations in the natural hides, each bag or wallet will uniquely form it's own personality over time and as each piece ages with graceful beauty you will find yourself with a luxurious, expertly made leather product  that will last a lifetime.
We are so thankful for making it through one of the toughest times in history as a small business and are wanting to take it to the next level... We want to relaunch the line by being able to present at one of the biggest venues in the world; the Las Vegas Project Show. It was by juried selection that we were chosen, and now we are in need of funding to pay for the booth, samples to show and our stay for the event. This one show will propel the brand to the next level. We are determined to keep the brand manufactured locally and to keep the line exclusive to the small business owners rather than big box retailers. We currently only sell to small boutiques that love and appreciate handmade quality goods manufactured in our United States and that love sharing the story of success, setback and relaunch!

<p>What started as a seemingly simple product to manufacture turned out to 
be quite exotic. No company in the United States produces suction cup 
matting. It's all manufactured in the Asian countries. The mold had to
 be designed from scratch. Pulling suction cups from an injection mold 
without tearing is no easy task. Mark Prestwood owner of Cad Design 
Manufacturing has worked diligently to insure this complicated mold will
 produce an outstanding component. In addition, Mark's price quote of 
$25,000 for the production mold beat China's price by $17,000.</p>

My name is James Monday and i am an architect with experience in large & small projects over a period of 35 years. After visiting Haiti in the aftermath of the devastating earthquake in 2010, working on assessments for rebuilding schools and preparing sustainable preservation and reconstruction guidelines for the town of Jacmel, I realized that the most critical need for survivors of natural and geo-political disasters is medical care, durable shelter and relief aid infrastructure. I believe that providing essential infrastructure facilities are key elements in any effort to rebuild the fabric of a damaged society. This habitat offers a prototypical solution for rapidly deployable infrastructure facilities: specifically modular medical health clinics.The modular medical clinic will able to be shipped anywhere in the world in standard cargo containers and can be erected and fully functioning in a matter of days. Constructed of durable materials and systems, the wwMH Medical Module is designed to be ready to stand alone off the damaged infrastructure grid and remain in place for as long as it is needed; or moved to other sites with a minimum effort.
We are currently developing prototype models and are seeking partners who are willing to collaborate with us to put these ideas and ideals into action. This is a  campaign to establish a non-profit business venture for the purpose of the design and manufacturing of sustainable modular structures where they are needed most for the following market groups:
Group 1: Farm workers housing (providing habitat with dignity to those who tie the knot between field & market & table). Estimate population 120 million worldwide.
Group 2: Community housing for new urban edge villages with co-op based gardens. Estimate population 12 million worldwide.
Group 3: Research community housing for artists, writers, musicians, painters & scientists. Estimate population 120,000 worldwide.
Group 4: Construction site office/Guest cottage for developers/landowners. Estimate population 12,000 worldwide.
Group 5: Disaster relief infrastructure facilities; specifically mobile modular medical clinics for devastated disaster areas and areas of critical endemic disease outbreaks. Estimate of this condition: unknown.WHAT WE NEED

In order to demonstrate the viability of this design idea and be able to provide these habitats to government and non-government organizations on a non-profit basis, initial investment capital in the amount of $300,000 is being sought to fund the development and marketing of 2 prototypes: one for demonstration of viability in Groups 1-4 and one in the Group 5 infrastructure facilities (ModularMedicalClinic) described above. We estimate $100,000 is needed to complete the design research and $200,000 to build the 2 prototypes. If we do not reach our outside goal of $300,000, we will apply whatever is raised to further the completion of the specific design effort. If we exceed our goal, we will extend our effort to implement production of specific prototypes by an outreach program to international relief organizations and NGOs (UNESCO, Partners in Health, Doctors Without Borders, Red Cross et. al). Perks (Rewards) will be offered for various donation levels, including custom pendant necklaces & wristbands; limited edition pamphlet & broadsides;  and custom design services and products for large donors.
IMPACT
Initially, the prototype habitat will serve as a laboratory model in different environments to explore modifications and refine techniques for future sustainable facilities on sites wherever they are needed, acquiring their own regional identities.  The worldwide modular habitat will promote independence from non-renewable resources, raise standards of sustainable design in mobile modular developments and will contribute to a bio-diverse permaculture landscape program with its “tread lightly” eco-efficient footprint. It is being designed for on-grid and off-grid installations and is targeted for a Net Zero Carbon Footprint.RISKS & CHALLENGES

The major risks facing the venture will be lack of capital for developing the products and marketing them successfully; failure to reach new markets and customers; failure to recognize a downturn in the general economy and make necessary adjustments; slow cash flow from accounts receivable; failure of owners to manage the business successfully.  The major risk to donors & investors will be the loss of funds ventured. We intend to manage these risks with care and due diligence to protect our joint investment and embrace the challenge to succeed.

It is less variable than clothing, does not give up so easily the passage of time and brings into our lives lots of additional colors and positive energy.

With your help I would like to expand my ideas and intentions to create gold and silver, modern and in ancient style. Plain and multicolored patterns characterized by beauty, elegance and high quality.   <br/><br/>By bypassing middlemen and web galleries receiving high commissions, my jewelry will not reach astronomical price and would be available to all. During the last months, I have gained a lot of new valuable experience and I established contacts with specialized companies and experienced people, so that the whole project is possible. I am a person well familiar with the fashion industry, and I know that it is not enough to think of anything immediately translated into a lasting success. That's why my approach is very pragmatic and hence the first projects alludes to the two consistently popular patterns which are the heart and a diamond, in a very trendy oriental and openwork variants.</p><p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440850498/y0a18tn5symb2wjvhycc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p> <b>                                            ABOUT JEWELRY OF CIO GIO</b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440853116/fxvkt1osozsnln4otejt.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>                                                                  <b> MATERIALS</b><br/><b><br/></b>Chains and earwires for earrings are made of 925 silver covered with the 24 carat  gold.

Yourself,  by ordering jewelry, someone of your friends who you can give it as a gift and me, approaching me to achieve the objective and fulfill my dreams.                                                   WHO I AM AND WHAT I MAKEMy name is Richard and from several months I am creating jewelry for women under the name of Cio Gio. Before that I was designing leather clothing and accessories but I decided to create something under my own brand and something more permanent that does not change with every coming season.Jewelry is a fascinating thing, from the beginning of mankind constitutes an essential element of human adornment. It is less variable than clothing, does not give up so easily the passage of time and brings into our lives lots of additional colors and positive energy. Creating jewelry is a new adventure for me that brings me a lot of satisfaction and eventually became my passion. I would like to continue and expand it, but for that I need your support.                                                           MY MISSIONWhat made me to establish Indiegogo campaign is striving to collect the missing funds to produce the minimum number of models that is needed to start selling it in my own online store. The opening of the store linked to the presence and campaign on all major social media could be a big step towards the promotion of my jewelry and allow me to further development and implementation of further designs.                                                           MY GOAL  6,000 USD  In preparation I have many projects and I am inspired by the minimalist and sophisticated jewelry that does not need to spend hundreds of dollars, pounds or euros to wear it. With your help I would like to expand my ideas and intentions to create gold and silver, modern and in ancient style. Plain and multicolored patterns characterized by beauty, elegance and high quality.   By bypassing middlemen and web galleries receiving high commissions, my jewelry will not reach astronomical price and would be available to all. During the last months, I have gained a lot of new valuable experience and I established contacts with specialized companies and experienced people, so that the whole project is possible. I am a person well familiar with the fashion industry, and I know that it is not enough to think of anything immediately translated into a lasting success. That's why my approach is very pragmatic and hence the first projects alludes to the two consistently popular patterns which are the heart and a diamond, in a very trendy oriental and openwork variants.                                             ABOUT JEWELRY OF CIO GIO                                                                   MATERIALSChains and earwires for earrings are made of 925 silver covered with the 24 carat  gold. Bracelets, pendants and most additives are made of brass coated with a 24 carat gold.                                                             CRAFTSMANSHIPChains and additions made of silver and brass are produced in two craft factories with a long tradition. Labels according to my design are manufactured with the latest CNC technology, ground and polished in a specialized subcontracting factory. I personally deal with assembly of jewelry in the finished product.                                                                                                            GILDINGJewelry as a whole is covered with galvanic coating of 24 carat yellow gold and on request can be also covered with galvanic coating of 18 carat white gold. It contains gold alloy of the highest quality with the addition of special materials, which increase the resistance for human sweat and atrition. Gilding finished jewelry is done by an experienced and specialized in this direction galvanic plant.                                                             DESIGN                         All jewelry designs are my idea and executed on my own.                                                         FAIR PRICESPrices of jewelry are attractive and reasonable in comparison to a      
 similar due to two factors. The first is that the production and       
gilding takes place in Poland, where production costs are much       
lower than in the UK and the US. The second is that you are buying      
 directly from the manufacturer bypassing intermediaries or online      
 galleries receiving high commissions of designers.                          COMPARE WITH LUXURY BRANDS AND GALLERIES                                                      YOUR REWARDSDeciding to buy PRE - SALE one or more of the models offered here, you invest in my project, and you allow the start of my store.

Now what I need is your full support to my dream could become a reality.Firstly, the payment will be used to purchase necessary materials and elegant packaging, the start of production, gilding finished products and finally send the jewelry to you.Secondly, it allows me to register a company with oficial office in London and will allow me to run an online store where you can buy jewelry with a fixed discount.Thirdly, it allows me to implement further projects and produce more models jewelry and will allow me to organize a professional photo shoot with models for the best presentation of my products in the online store.                                         --------------------   PERKS   --------------------                                                                                                          EARRINGS - OPENWORK HEARTS                                                                            25 USD Made of 24ct yellow gold plated brass or on request of 18ct white gold plated brass.  Hearts 4cm x 4cm,  length of earrings 5,5cm.                                  NECKLACE WITH OPENWORK PENDANT HEART                                                                  35 USD,  39 USD Made of 24ct yellow gold plated brass or on request of 18ct white gold plated brass.  Pendant 4cm x 4cm.                                                                            35 USD Short chain  15"" - 17"",  38cm - 43cm length ( adjustable to smaller an larger sizes )Medium chain  18"" - 20"",  46cm - 51cm length ( adjustable to smaller an larger sizes)                                                                           39 USD Long chain  23"" - 25"",  58cm - 63cm length ( adjustable to smaller an larger sizes )             NECKLACE WITH OPENWORK PENDANT HEART AND SHORT CHAINS                                                                             39 USDMade of 24ct yellow gold plated brass or on request of 18ct white gold plated brass.  Pendant 4cm x 4cm.

<h1>Why use technology to make frames for glasses in your iPhone protection case?</h1>
<div>
<b></b><p></p>
<p>The frames for glasses need to be super lightweight, ultra-flexible, extremely durable and also stylish – the exact qualities needed for your iPhone protection case.</p>
<p>We use stainless steel metal sheet technology – perfected in the glasses industry – to reinvent iPhone protection cases.</p>
<p>Super flexible stainless steel metal sheet is 10 times harder than plastic, 5 times harder than aluminum alloy, and has a thickness of only 0.5mm.</p>

<p>ice! bumper is a super-thin, ultra-light, spring stainless steel bumper with minimal weight and maximum protection. And it’s crafted with style. By using polishing technology we’ve learnt from the eyewear industry, the smooth rounded edges of ice! bumper are cool to the touch. Because the ice! bumper is neither screwed, soldered, or welded, it maintains an element of simplicity, clarity and ingenuity.<br/></p>

<h2><b>Focus on corner protection</b></h2>
<p>Having analyzed more than 1,000 iPhones with broken screens, 92% of the initial cracking points start from the corner of the phone. And that’s precisely why ice! bumper has 0.3mm corner walls to provide full protection for your iPhone.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442405996/qcoeilxlmd2air0cdnk9.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>When placing your iPhone on a surface table, the cornerwalls prevent contact between the screen and the table – so no scratches at all!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

<h2><br/></h2>
<h2>Why ice! bumper you say?</h2>
<div><br/></div>
<ul>
<li>Lighter and gives you more</li>
</ul>
<p>The 0.5mm thick ultra-light weight stainless steel makes ice! bumper 75% lighter than other cases on the market. iPhone gets lighter and thinner with each new model – your bumper should be too.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

<p><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul>
<li>Thinner and harder</li>
</ul>
<p>The hardness of spring stainless steel is 5 times that of aluminum, 10 times stronger than plastic, and it’s only 50% as thick as those materials. Nothing comes close to it – ice! bumper gives better protection for your iPhone.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>Awesome protection</li>
</ul>
<p>Specially designed 0.3mm corner walls provide full protection for your iPhone. No matter how the phone gets dropped, it doesn’t come into contact with the ground.</p>

<div><b><br/></b></div>
<ul>
<li>The ice! bumper 5 / 5s in 2013</li>
</ul>
<p>Back in 2013, when the iPhone 5s was launched, we designed and released the ice! bumper 5 / 5s, our first iPhone bumper. It was great and more than 10,000 units were sold.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441785739/npdutbyfrkkf1ud1h8ny.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul>
<li>Better design, better production process, better quality in 2015</li>
</ul>
<p>Our team spent a year re-designing the ice! bumper after the launch of iPhone 6. The shape has evolved into a simpler form, providing a low-key and reserved style that is more mature and even easier to handle.</p>

<br/><h2><span>Risk &amp; challenges</span></h2>
<p>This is not our first product. We already have many products on the market, so the risks are minimized due to experience.</p>
<p>We have a goal of shipping units in Dec 2015. Your support will help us speed up mass-production, acquire parts and tooling, and hire additional manpower to get units shipping asap.  If we don't meet the funding goal, we will still continue with the project and will bring this revolutionary product to market. We believe in this product concept and will make it happen. We've done this on our own with ice! bumper 5 / 5s, and  other products, but here we are looking to speed things up via crowd-funding.

Why use technology to make frames for glasses in your iPhone protection case?


The frames for glasses need to be super lightweight, ultra-flexible, extremely durable and also stylish – the exact qualities needed for your iPhone protection case.
We use stainless steel metal sheet technology – perfected in the glasses industry – to reinvent iPhone protection cases.
Super flexible stainless steel metal sheet is 10 times harder than plastic, 5 times harder than aluminum alloy, and has a thickness of only 0.5mm.




Meet the ice! bumper 6S




ice! bumper is a super-thin, ultra-light, spring stainless steel bumper with minimal weight and maximum protection. And it’s crafted with style. By using polishing technology we’ve learnt from the eyewear industry, the smooth rounded edges of ice! bumper are cool to the touch. Because the ice! bumper is neither screwed, soldered, or welded, it maintains an element of simplicity, clarity and ingenuity.






Focus on corner protection
Having analyzed more than 1,000 iPhones with broken screens, 92% of the initial cracking points start from the corner of the phone. And that’s precisely why ice! bumper has 0.3mm corner walls to provide full protection for your iPhone.





When placing your iPhone on a surface table, the cornerwalls prevent contact between the screen and the table – so no scratches at all!





Why ice! bumper you say?


Lighter and gives you more

The 0.5mm thick ultra-light weight stainless steel makes ice! bumper 75% lighter than other cases on the market. iPhone gets lighter and thinner with each new model – your bumper should be too.









Thinner and harder

The hardness of spring stainless steel is 5 times that of aluminum, 10 times stronger than plastic, and it’s only 50% as thick as those materials. Nothing comes close to it – ice! bumper gives better protection for your iPhone.





Awesome protection

Specially designed 0.3mm corner walls provide full protection for your iPhone. No matter how the phone gets dropped, it doesn’t come into contact with the ground.








No signal drop

The ice! bumper do not cover the antenna area of the iPhone and it will not affect the cellular signal, wifi, and bluetooth reception.




Not the first time we’ve used stainless steel for an iPhone bumper


The ice! bumper 5 / 5s in 2013

Back in 2013, when the iPhone 5s was launched, we designed and released the ice! bumper 5 / 5s, our first iPhone bumper. It was great and more than 10,000 units were sold.





Better design, better production process, better quality in 2015

Our team spent a year re-designing the ice! bumper after the launch of iPhone 6. The shape has evolved into a simpler form, providing a low-key and reserved style that is more mature and even easier to handle.









Risk & challenges
This is not our first product. We already have many products on the market, so the risks are minimized due to experience.
We have a goal of shipping units in Dec 2015. Your support will help us speed up mass-production, acquire parts and tooling, and hire additional manpower to get units shipping asap.  If we don't meet the funding goal, we will still continue with the project and will bring this revolutionary product to market. We believe in this product concept and will make it happen. We've done this on our own with ice! bumper 5 / 5s, and  other products, but here we are looking to speed things up via crowd-funding. So speed the main risk, which you can help mitigate by contributing today. Help us deliver the product as fast as possible!

เคส iPhone ของคุณตกยุคไปแล้ว?
iPhone รุ่นใหม่ ๆ ที่ทำด้วยโลหะผสมอลูมิเนียมสวยหรูนั้นล้วนบางและเบาลงเรื่อย ๆ
แล้วคุณยังจะใช้เคส iPhone หนาเตอะแบบเมื่อห้าปีที่แล้วอยู่เหรอ
เพื่ออะไรกัน?

ไม่ใช่ความผิดคุณหรอก!
เพราะว่าตัวเครื่องอลูมิเนียมนั้นเป็นรอยง่าย ส่วนหน้าจอก็อาจแตกเอาได้ถ้าคุณเผลอทำโทรศัพท์หล่น
แต่ทำไงได้ล่ะ คุณก็ไม่อยากให้สิ่งเหล่านั้นเกิดขึ้นกับโทรศัพท์ราคาแพงของคุณนี่นา เลยจำใจต้องใช้เคสทั่ว ๆ ไปที่ทั้งหนาและใหญ่เทอะทะ

เชิญพบกับ ice! bumper 6S



ice! bumper คือเคสสแตนเลสที่บางเฉียบ เบาหวิว และยืดหยุ่น ซึ่งช่วยให้โทรศัพท์ของคุณได้รับการปกป้องสูงสุด
มันถูกผลิตมาอย่างมีสไตล์ด้วยเทคโนโลยีการขัดมันแบบเดียวกับที่ใช้ในอุตสาหกรรมแว่นตา ทำให้ได้เคส ice! bumper ที่เรียบเนียนชวนให้น่าสัมผัส
ice! bumper ไม่ต้องการการขันน็อตหรือการเชื่อมใด ๆ ทั้งสิ้น มันจึงดูสวยเฉียบในแบบที่เรียบง่าย





แล้วทำไมถึงต้องเลือก ice! bumper?



เบากว่าและให้อะไรมากกว่า

ด้วยเคสสแตนเลสที่บางเพียง 0.5 ม.ม. ทำให้ ice! bumper นั้นเบากว่าเคสเจ้าอื่น ๆ ในตลาดถึง 75% 
iPhone รุ่นใหม่ ๆ ที่เบาและบางลงเรื่อย ๆ นั้นคู่ควรกับเคสที่เบาและบางกว่าเดิมเช่นกัน





บางลงแต่ทนทานขึ้น

เคสสแตนเลสนี้มีความทนทานมากกว่าอลูมิเนียม 5 เท่าและมากกว่ากรอบพลาสติกถึง 10 เท่า แต่เคสตัวนี้กลับบางกว่าเคสที่ทำด้วยวัสดุเหล่านั้นถึง 50%
ไม่มีอะไรที่จะดีไปกว่านี้อีกแล้วสำหรับ ice! bumper ตัวนี้ที่ช่วยปกป้อง iPhone ของคุณได้ดีกว่า



การปกป้องที่ยอดเยี่ยม

หัวมุมของเคสที่ยกสูงขึ้น 0.3 ม.ม. เป็นพิเศษนั้นช่วยปกป้อง iPhone ของคุณได้อย่างเต็มที่
ไม่ว่าจะทำโทรศัพท์ตกอีท่าไหนก็ตาม หน้าจอก็จะไม่สัมผัสกับพื้นอีกต่อไป







สัญญาณไม่ตก

เคส ice! bumper ไม่ได้บดบังบริเวณเสาอากาศของตัว iPhone ทำให้สัญญาณโทรศัพท์ ไวไฟ หรือการเชื่อมต่อบลูทูธนั้นล้วนเป็นไปอย่างปกติ




ทำไมต้องเน้นการปกป้องตรงหัวมุม?
จากการวิเคราะห์การแตกของหน้าจอ iPhone มากกว่า 1,000 เครื่องพบว่ารอยแตกของหน้าจอนั้นมักเริ่มเกิดจากตรงบริเวณหัวมุมของโทรศัพท์ถึง 92%
นั่นคือสาเหตุว่าทำไมหัวมุมของเคส ice! bumper จึงต้องสูงกว่าบริเวณอื่น 0.3 ม.ม. ก็เพื่อที่จะได้ปกป้อง iPhone ของคุณได้อย่างเต็มที่นั่นเอง


เจ้าขอบหัวมุมที่ว่ายังป้องกันไม่ให้หน้าจอสัมผัสกับโต๊ะเมื่อคุณวาง iPhone ไว้บนโต๊ะด้วย ทำให้หน้าจอไม่มีทางเป็นรอยได้อย่างเด็ดขาด!



นี่ไม่ใช่ครั้งแรกที่เราใช้สแตนเลสทำเคส iPhone



เคส ice! bumper 5 / 5s ในปี 2013

ย้อนไปเมื่อปี 2013 เมื่อ iPhone 5s ได้เปิดตัวนั้น เราได้ออกแบบและจำหน่าย ice! bumper 5 / 5s ซึ่งคือเคส iPhone ตัวแรกของเรา
และด้วยยอดจำหน่ายที่มากกว่า 10,000 ชิ้นนั้นคือสิ่งยืนยันถึงความยอดเยี่ยมของมัน




การออกแบบที่ดีกว่า กระบวนการผลิตที่ดีกว่า คุณภาพที่ดีกว่า ในปี 2015

ทีมของเราใช้เวลาร่วมปีในการพัฒนา ice! bumper หลังจากการเปิดตัวของ iPhone 6 ทำให้ได้เคสใหม่ที่มีรูปร่างเรียบง่ายกว่าเดิมแต่ยังคงไว้ซึ่งสไตล์ที่เฉียบและการใช้งานที่สะดวกกว่าเดิม







ความเสี่ยงและความท้าทาย
นี่ไม่ใช่ผลิตภัณฑ์ตัวแรกของเรา
ประสบการณ์ของเราในการป้อนผลิตภัณฑ์มากมายลงสู่ตลาดนั้น ช่วยลดความเสี่ยงให้อยู่ในระดับน้อยสุดได้
เรามีแผนป้อนผลิตภัณฑ์นี้สู่ตลาดในเดือนธันวาคม 2015 แต่ยอดสั่งซื้อของคุณสามารถช่วยให้เราป้อนผลิตภัณฑ์ได้เร็วกว่านั้นได้ เพราะเราจะนำทุนที่ได้มาเพิ่มความเร็วในการผลิต เสาะหาชิ้นส่วนและเครื่องมือ และจ้างแรงงานเพิ่มเติม
แต่ถึงแม้จะระดมทุนได้ไม่ถึงเป้าก็ตาม เราก็ยังจะเดินหน้าโครงการนี้ต่อไปเพื่อป้อนผลิตภัณฑ์ที่เป็นการปฏิวัติวงการชิ้นนี้สู่ตลาดให้ได้
เราเชื่อมั่นในผลิตภัณฑ์ชิ้นนี้และจะสร้างมันให้สำเร็จ
เราเคยสร้างผลิตภัณฑ์แบบนี้มาแล้วด้วยกำลังผลิตของเราเองกับ ice! bumper 5 / 5s และผลิตภัณฑ์ตัวอื่น ๆ แต่ครั้งนี้เราต้องการระดมทุนเพื่อหวังที่จะสร้างสรรค์ผลงานให้ได้เร็วยิ่งขึ้น
ดังนั้นความเสี่ยงเดียวของผลิตภัณฑ์นี้ก็คือความเร็วในการผลิตนั่นเอง ซึ่งคุณสามารถช่วยลดมันลงได้ด้วยการสนับสนุนเราในวันนี้
มาช่วยให้เราส่งมอบผลิตภัณฑ์ได้เร็วขึ้นกัน!

I am completely self taught, and thanks to the age of the internet and social media I have made great strides in a short amount of time.  I have always been a creative person, and find myself changing from one hobby to another often. It wasn't until I found machining that I finally found something that was challenging enough to keep me coming back for more.  </p>
<p>After purchasing a CNC lathe, I needed to learn how use the thing. So I needed to create something, but what? That's when I realized how often I was searching for tools, and looking for pieces of tape to hold my drawings on the machine. A few years back I was really into salt water aquariums and used N52 (Rare Earth Magnets) to hold Coral Racks inside the tank. That's when I realized I could use that same type of magnet and create a utility magnet, that I could use for a variety of applications. I made a few magnets for myself and friends. They became so popular among my friends and family I decided to go ahead and create this project to share with this community.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, I am just a hard working guy, trying to run a small home based CNC business. We all have dreams, but not all of us get to live those dreams. Without the support from this awesome crowdfunding site, I wouldn't be living mine. So Please take a look at my project and support if you like! </p>

</div><div>
<div>Yes, I  really only need $500 to get this project going. I want to get as many magnets out there as I can. So I am keeping this part simple. I am asking for $500 dollars. This low funding number should guarantee the project gets funded. I am in a unique position, I own all of my machinery and it's located in my back yard. Once funding is reached, I can purchase the materials needed and start manufacturing the magnets immediately. This will allow me to stay ahead of the game, and get the product shipped on time. I will not be at the mercy of busy machine shops who under quote and over promise quick timelines.</div>

My name is Ryan and like most of you guys, I work a full-time job, and spend most of my free time in my shop. I have always been fascinated with CNC machining and was fortunate enough to acquire a few pieces of machinery in the last few years. I am completely self taught, and thanks to the age of the internet and social media I have made great strides in a short amount of time.  I have always been a creative person, and find myself changing from one hobby to another often. It wasn't until I found machining that I finally found something that was challenging enough to keep me coming back for more.  
After purchasing a CNC lathe, I needed to learn how use the thing. So I needed to create something, but what? That's when I realized how often I was searching for tools, and looking for pieces of tape to hold my drawings on the machine. A few years back I was really into salt water aquariums and used N52 (Rare Earth Magnets) to hold Coral Racks inside the tank. That's when I realized I could use that same type of magnet and create a utility magnet, that I could use for a variety of applications. I made a few magnets for myself and friends. They became so popular among my friends and family I decided to go ahead and create this project to share with this community.
At the end of the day, I am just a hard working guy, trying to run a small home based CNC business. We all have dreams, but not all of us get to live those dreams. Without the support from this awesome crowdfunding site, I wouldn't be living mine. So Please take a look at my project and support if you like! 
   What is it?









The Affordable Utility Magnet, is truly what it sounds like. It's an affordable utility magnet with a variety of uses around your home or shop. Only your imagination will be it's limit. 
Let's face it, I am not re-inventing the wheel, but with that being said, there is always a little room for different tread patterns. After doing a little research, I realized most of the magnets on the marketplace were either too small or made of some exotic material that drove the price up. Trust me, I love all those materials just as much as the next guy, but personally didn't feel it was right for this application. 
After taking that into consideration I decided I wanted to focus in on a few areas that were lacking on the market, and decided on the 3 areas listed below.






 1. Size and Style 
Length: 1.2""
Diameter .60"" - .55""

Most of the magnets on the market are very small. I wanted to create a larger magnet that was easier to grab onto and easy to see.  I also created what I call the ""Double Magnet"" This versatile Magnet has 2 magnets pressed in giving even more options for applications. You can choose the Single Magnet or the Double Magnet in the Perks Section.
 
2. Materials
Black or White Delrin
Polished C360 Brass

After testing different materials, I decided to go with a material called Delrin, if you have never heard of Delrin before that's ok, I won't bore you with all the technical terms. It's manufactured by Dupont and also called Acetal Resin. It's a very durable light weight crystalline plastic. Quite frankly, it's the perfect application for the Affordable Utility Magnet. 
I also decided to offer the Affordable Utility Magnet in a Polished Brass version, for those looking to add a touch of class to their Affordable Utility Magnet. To keep the cost down, I am only offering this version in the Single Magnet version. 
The magnet is called a N52 (Rare Earth Magnet) it has an approximate pull force of 7.7lbs. I tested different strengths and chose this model for it's versatility. Strong enough to hold wrenches, kitchen utensils and notes for the refrigerator. 
C360 Polished Brass - For those looking for a Magnet that is still affordable, but has an extra touch of class! 


3. Price
""Affordable""

This is where my magnet shines. Take a look at the Perks and you will see how ""Affordable"" my utility magnet is.

    Risks & Challenges Like everything we do in life this project will have certain risks and challenges. Seeing that I am a perfectionist in every aspect of my life, I have already laid out 95% of the ground work before deciding to launch this campaign.
I truly don't foresee any major issues coming up for this project. I have already created the final project. All the prototyping and re-designs have been completed.

<h4> Risks &amp; Challenges</h4>
<p>We've been in the industry for over 7 years so we've got some great experience under our belt on how this industry works.</p>
<p>We also have experience dealing with completely unexpected issues, and we have always dealt with them in a way that leaves our customers happy with their purchase and proud to support our company.</p>
<p>Our existing customers know that we always try to go the extra mile, no matter what. In short, we know what we're doing, and you should be very confident that we will deliver what we say we will, when we say we will. And we solemnly swear that should unforeseen issues come up, we will handle them with the utmost transparency and care for you, our backers. That is our guarantee.</p>
<p>Shipping &amp; Fulfillment: With us already having a boutique we are very connected in the fashion world which allows us to reach out to other brands that carry similar products should a fulfillment issue arise with one of our vendors. Shipping large numbers of packages is a new venture for us and with our hub being in Alaska shipments can be a bit slower. We have researched shipping subscription boxes extensively and added in some padding for time frames because of our location. We feel confident that we will be able to manage any shipping issue that may arise effectively and efficiently.</p>
<p>Scale: From an operations perspective, we've structured our business on scale-able platforms, so we'll be capable of seamless, tiered growth. But because we are a small business, fast exponential growth could be challenging(but definitely a good problem).</p>
<p>As with all businesses, we'll have some interesting and exciting challenges to overcome, but we're confident we have the business experience, foresight, and tools that we need to address these issues, and manage our scheduling appropriately.</p>
<p>Thank you, again, for your consideration and backing! We truly appreciate the outpouring of support we have received from all of our customers, friends, family, and collaborators!</p>

</div></div>","A boutique customized to your personal preferences and shipped to your door! Sounds amazing? Yes it is! A new way of shopping that removes problems like crowds, digging through racks of things that don’t appeal to you, knowing if things will work with what is in your current closet, and minimizes the time required to get clothes you love! Each time you order a Personal Boutique Box , your Personal Shopper will pick 5 items for you based on your personal clothing preferences and body shape/type. These items will then be boxed up and shipped to your door so you can try them on in the comfort of your home. Each of our Personal Shoppers work on the sales floor in a successful boutique and therefore are very knowledgeable about how things fit, what trends are hot right now, and what items are top sellers because they look amazing on!
   

 All of our Personal Shoppers work on the sales floor at our boutique as well as create Personalized Boutique Boxes.

Because of this they are incredibly knowledgeable about current trends, how things fit different body shapes/styles, and what items are selling fast! This allows them to pick items for you with a much higher chance of them being perfect for you! It also means that the Personal Shoppers are touching every piece they pack for you and know they are sending quality items you should LOVE!

it…it’s a triumph you will never forget. Ever since I started my Bachelor

to invest properly. When you google about fashion, beauty or journeys you
always end up finding a great number of articles or blogs written by people who
are not really  involved with this subject.
My life is full of Men and I pretty much know that both in business and life “this
is a Man's World”. However, Men do not know how to live it in the most stylish,
successful, luxurious, worthwhile way. Even if some of them know the secret of
being a Man to remember and a role model they do not have a proper “way""
to speak it out loud in order for others to follow their lead and become also a

</p><p>When growing up, not a day went by where I did not dream of
big lights, large crowds of people, and a finished product too grand for my own
eyes to believe. I was an artist by nature always ready to create but not just
anything. The concepts were rare, grand, and more importantly strategic.</p>
<p>The older I became the smaller my dreams seemed and the less
important I became to myself. I was so busy chasing someone else’s dream my vision became blurry and eventually I was lost in a deep gray cloud.</p>
<p>As years passed, I gained experience and education in
multiple areas such as public relations, marketing, business management, event
planning, photography, and videography. I graduated from S.I. Newhouse School
of Public Communications at Syracuse University with a bachelor’s and a
master’s degree. I was beyond confident my talents would be a key attribute to
a company someday. The more I worked achieving the dreams of others the less
appreciation I had for myself. I began to live what Pastor Rick Warren refers
to as the 4F Life, “A life filled with frustration, failure, fatigue, and
fear.” </p>
<p>My passion for fashion, people, culture, and innovation will
have a measurable impact on the world and the people who live in it. So rather
than live in gray clouds, I decided to sweep away the dust and shine some light
on the beautiful gifts God shaped me with. I decided to be my own boss.</p>
<p>With this being said, I humbly invite you and others to
invest in me. All I need is the freedom and the opportunity to make my visions
become a reality.</p>
<p>On Saturday, February 27<sup>th</sup>, 2016. I will be
launching my fashion and lifestyle brand called TZB with an art exhibit launch party. The money raised will help
pay for the venue called The Bridge Multicultural Project located in Brooklyn,
New York. Though I wish the space was free it’s not but it is everything I
need.  At the launch I will be presenting
various pieces of artwork I’ve created over the years. The pieces are a glimpse
of the beauty in my head ranging from fashion to abstract paintings. It’s about
time I introduced the world to TZB.</p>
<p>If you cannot make a financial contribution, I ask you
spread the word about the event and myself. Tell family, friends, coworkers,

<p><b>i.b.b.i. Collection: Designs for Your
Curvy Body</b></p>
<p><i>Fashionable, on trend, plus sized
knit dresses celebrating you and your curves</i></p>
<p>There is no more powerful inspiration than identifying a significant void
and filling it. The i.b.b.i. Collection understands sophisticated, curvy, plus-size
women want to be on trend for fashion, but her desires and needs are being ignored
by the fashion industry.</p>
<p><b><br/><br/></b></p><p><b></b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1453845644/lnxi853z9v0hufqmxush.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>
</p><p>We
learned the plus-sized woman is different from her smaller sisters only
in size—she wants to celebrate her curves, not disguise them! She represents 67% of the
female population and she's being ignored, marginalized, by the fashion
industry.  Because her options are
so limited and off-trend, we built the i.b.b.i. Collection to deliver what she
wants and desires.  We believe
there is no reason--business or social--for her not to celebrate her curves in
fashion-forward, on trend, sexy, sumptuous dresses!</p>

<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>It’s time to celebrate your
curves!</b></p>
<p>i.b.b.i. Collection believes it's time to celebrate curvy, sexy, confident
plus-sized women and give them the attention they deserve, dressing her the way
she wants to dress. In body conscious youthful styling, vibrant colors and

<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>We’ve done our homework</b></p>
<p>For the sophisticated plus-sized woman today’s fashion marketplace offers few
quality, on-trend options appropriate for her lifestyle. Her choices at the
high end of the market are limited to shapeless, disguising, bland colored
garments. Simply put: most plus-sized fashions are designed to cover up and
conceal her curves, rather than celebrate them.</p>
<p>The i.b.b.i. woman doesn't live her life in t-shirts and polyester pull-ons.
We're listening to her and giving her fashion, quality and fit.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1453845969/umkf7kromndxwa5haw5y.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>What makes us different? Why should plus-size women trust us?</b></p>
<p>We work from a foundation of eight guiding
principles honed in the workshop of experience and a desire to bring the
i.b.b.i. woman uncompromising quality, consistent fit and cutting edge fashion.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>One:</b> 
     Our inspiration comes directly from what plus-sized women tell us they
     want. Plus-size fashionistas from all around the blogosphere are stating
     their desires loud and clear in on-going interactive dialogues with their
     followers and we’re listening.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>
<b>Two:</b> Typically,
     plus-size garments are graded from a size 6 or 8 and we know from
     experience these grades do not account for the real life body proportions
     of a curvy woman! We've re-calibrated 
     the grading ratios and have very carefully designed our dresses to
     suit five curvy body types (the Wedge, the Triangle, the Oval, the
     Rectangle and the Hour-glass). We have engineered creative construction
     details to solve fitting issues, giving curvy women multiple choices.
     Bottom line: our garments fit and make women feel good!</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>
<b>Three:</b> We’re
     making it easy to find the right size, style and fit! Not only do we believe in
     clearly labeling our garments  14/16/18/20/22/24 but we offer a clear how-to-measure her body instruction which will help her make wise choices in her size and style. And we offer key symbols with each dress to further help her consider her options. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1453846234/epwio9cibbmxhivqccdm.jpg"" src="""" style=""background-color: initial;""/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Four: </b>We exclusively offer knit garments, created using a luxurious blended yarn with stretch that gives our dresses a fresh look, from morning through to evening. Our dresses are knit to shape, fully fashioned and have a slight compression for a better fit and easy care. The hand touch is smooth, soft and inviting. Our knits feel wonderful on the body and best of all, they move with her—without creep or twist—and pay homage to her curves.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Five:</b> We're translators taking
     trends, color and style direction from the runway and translating them into
     a plus-size friendly construction, creating garments specifically
     engineered for the curvy body. The plus-sized woman needs the technical
     attention we provide to create dresses that caress her curves, highlight
     her big, beautiful assets, but she also wants the fashion-forward mindset
     that comes with them.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Six:</b> We
     recognize we’re serving a demographically well-defined marketplace, filled
     with ethnically diverse women. Through our brand and style, i.b.b.i.
     Collection acknowledges women who are sophisticated, educated, career
     driven, fashion savvy, confident and vested in quality when it comes to
     her wardrobe. We don’t just make clothes: we honor the women who wear them.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Seven</b><b>:</b>
     i.b.b.i. Collection garments are already in demand! We’ve developed two
     capsule lines of clothing that have been widely embraced, proving not only
     our understanding of the women we’re making clothing for, but exemplifying
     our mission of bringing fashion-forward designs to this niche market.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Eight</b><b>:</b>
     On a risk/reward scale, i.b.b.i. Collection has the tools to succeed. Our solid experience
     in the garment industry; longstanding relationship with our factory;
     success in predicting trends and translating the runway into wear now plus-size
     garments; and, technical expertise and innovative solutions put us far out
     front in the vanguard of designers just starting to focus on the needs of
     the plus-size woman.</li>

</div>","i.b.b.i. Collection: Designs for Your
Curvy Body
Fashionable, on trend, plus sized
knit dresses celebrating you and your curves
There is no more powerful inspiration than identifying a significant void
and filling it. The i.b.b.i. Collection understands sophisticated, curvy, plus-size
women want to be on trend for fashion, but her desires and needs are being ignored
by the fashion industry.


We
learned the plus-sized woman is different from her smaller sisters only
in size—she wants to celebrate her curves, not disguise them! She represents 67% of the
female population and she's being ignored, marginalized, by the fashion
industry.  Because her options are
so limited and off-trend, we built the i.b.b.i. Collection to deliver what she
wants and desires.  We believe
there is no reason--business or social--for her not to celebrate her curves in
fashion-forward, on trend, sexy, sumptuous dresses!


It’s time to celebrate your
curves!
i.b.b.i. Collection believes it's time to celebrate curvy, sexy, confident
plus-sized women and give them the attention they deserve, dressing her the way
she wants to dress. In body conscious youthful styling, vibrant colors and
patterns, in on-trend designs the i.b.b.i. Collection provides her with
sophisticated, fashion smart knit dresses she can wear now.

Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute financially, but that doesn't mean you can't help us.  Please help us to spread the word about our campaign. We all have a network of people and I'm asking that you will spread the word about Goliath's Gear with your network of family and friends.  To share our campaign use the Indiegogo share tools

<p>Astonishing. Now start thinking at all the possibilities brought by this technology...</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>RTK technology is not new but only recently it has become possible to compute this algorithm in real-time. Two GNSS receivers are used instead of one, in order to calculate <i>double differences</i>. A static receiver is motionless and called <i>base</i>.<i> </i>The other receiver is called <i>rover</i>. A datalink is needed between <i>base </i>and <i>rover </i>to send differential data.</p>
<p>Quite a lot of factors affect GNSS signals. First, you have to keep in mind that these signals are extremely weak. They are emitted by satellites at a power of roughly 30 W (that is 30 times lower than the power used by your microwave oven). Additionnally they have to travel 20 000 km before reaching the atmosphere. There, they have to cross ionosphere (which, as its name states, is heavily ionised and ends up refracting and reflecting signals) and troposphere before reaching your receiver. Quite a long trip!</p>
<p>All these factors result in a fair decrease of classical GNSS devices. RTK corrects a lot of the introduced error by using differential data. In the end, it reaches a centimeter accuracy.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Why is this product so special?</h2>
<p>This is just like comparing computers in the 90's and right now. At that time a whole floor was needed to compute very simple arithmetic. Nowadays we embed dual-core processors in footprints smaller than 1 square centimeter. The logic of this design is to make this technology highly embedabble for a high number of applications.</p>
<p>Older RTK devices are dual frequency receivers, that means they are able to use L1 (1575.42 MHz) and L2 (1227.60 MHz) frequencies. The problem is that hardware capable of demultiplexing L2 signals is very expensive (we are talking of 10+k €). In order to keep it low cost, we deal only with L1 frequency. It has been shown that this does not know decrease the precision of the solution, but only its availability (that means L1/L2 will perform better in complex scenarios, where sky view is highly obstructed, but that is a very specific and rare use case).</p>
<p>As stated before, you need a base in order to provide your rover with differential data. Companies generally sell a monthly subscription in order to get differential data from a network of pre-established bases. The cost of this subscription is about 3k € per year, which is not negligible. We offer you to have your own base, so you can be completely autonomous on all fronts! </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>""Drotek's integrated solution makes centimeter-level positioning technology more accessible for applications such as commercial UAVs and robotic guidance systems. As all RTK algorithms are pre-integrated into the u-blox NEO-M8P module, size and weight are significantly reduced compared to existing solutions, and power consumption is five times lower, therefore dramatically cutting costs and improving usability.""</i></p>

<h3>What is Guardian Module ?  </h3>
<p>This is the module that will keep your things safe. Your phone will be difficult to steal, but if such an unfortunate event happens, you will be able to find it even if it is rebooted, if the accounts are deleted, the SIM card removed and if it has no range to an internet connection. Sounds too great to be true but it is now possible. You can connect your phone and a tracker to your guardian modular feature (the tracker can be attached to any object you do not wish to lose and keep safe). You can preset a distance from where you will be alerted if your phone and/or tracker overpasses the safety range of the modular system. The distance can be set from 50 cm to 30 meters. If your phone is stolen you can press the two buttons at the same time. This feature triggers the App Guardian and it does the following: It blocks the phone - the device cannot be shut down, only if the battery is removed, otherwise all of the features from the guardian app will keep working until the battery is empty. An alarm is triggered with the maximum ringtone capacity. A program called Thieves Nightmare will start working. If it is installed and activated, it has the following effect: In case the person who took the device deletes all the accounts, resets the phone and then uses a new SIM card, the program reinstalls itself automatically, recognizes that the SIM card does not belong to its owner and sends a text message with the exact location of the phone, and now pay attention: NO INTERNET CONNECTION REQUIRED for those features and it also gives you the possibility to communicate with the person that has your device.</p>

<h3>What is The Storage Module ?</h3>
<p>The Off-Line Cloud module was designed to increase the storage capacity of your phone by 128 GB and to facilitate the access of data without using internet connection.</p>
<p>If the phone’s memory is full you have an extra 128 GB for your needs. The module can synchronize with the phone through the IBee Off-Line Cloud and can make a backup of the phone’s system. The new files that are created can automatically be saved in the module. All data is AES 128 bit encrypted and you can separately create passwords on the files you want to protect.</p>
<p>The data delivering between the phone and the module is also encrypted. Downloading and uploading the data can be made with the use of the USB belt on the bracelet via of the Notification module. The module has a safety system in case it is lost. It can communicate periodically with the phone app. In the exact moment the connection is lost, the module is blocked.</p>
<p>Every time the module is used in the bracelet’s system you must register a random password generated by the App in order to be initialized. (The system is just like the token system used for Internet banking)</p>

IBee Fashion
We managed to combine technology with fashion in such an extraordinary way that we are really proud of. We didn't just create a smart modular bracelet, we created a development system of smart jewelry. 
IBee project came from the desire of creating something beautiful, wearable, extremely intelligent, an everyday jewelry, capable of making your life easier through the special functions tailored on your particular needs.


 
If you want to help us, support our project by sharing it.
Together we can make a difference!
 

 
IBee Modular System
 

 
The modular concept was implemented in the hardware field as well as in software. Both the device and the app are designed this way and they are linked to an open development platform. This platform will give developers the possibility to create innovative hardware and software specifications using our concept and add new functionality to the modular system created by our company.
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
If you want to discuss technical details, we hope that this section will clear everything up for you.
 
What is Guardian Module ?  
This is the module that will keep your things safe. Your phone will be difficult to steal, but if such an unfortunate event happens, you will be able to find it even if it is rebooted, if the accounts are deleted, the SIM card removed and if it has no range to an internet connection. Sounds too great to be true but it is now possible. You can connect your phone and a tracker to your guardian modular feature (the tracker can be attached to any object you do not wish to lose and keep safe). You can preset a distance from where you will be alerted if your phone and/or tracker overpasses the safety range of the modular system. The distance can be set from 50 cm to 30 meters. If your phone is stolen you can press the two buttons at the same time. This feature triggers the App Guardian and it does the following: It blocks the phone - the device cannot be shut down, only if the battery is removed, otherwise all of the features from the guardian app will keep working until the battery is empty. An alarm is triggered with the maximum ringtone capacity. A program called Thieves Nightmare will start working. If it is installed and activated, it has the following effect: In case the person who took the device deletes all the accounts, resets the phone and then uses a new SIM card, the program reinstalls itself automatically, recognizes that the SIM card does not belong to its owner and sends a text message with the exact location of the phone, and now pay attention: NO INTERNET CONNECTION REQUIRED for those features and it also gives you the possibility to communicate with the person that has your device.

<h2><u>INTRO</u></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Hi!</p>
<p>My name is Loulou João. I am an illustrator from Belgium with a passion for embroidery. While I'm still pursuing my studies, I run a little company to promote and sell my artwork: longlasting and wearable apparel, accessories and hopefully much more to come!</p>
<p>I hope that one day my business can grow to become a fulltime activity. Your help will get me closer to this dream! By reaching my goal, I'll be able to get some funds back after the purchase of  my own embroidery machine that I will use to expand my brand. You can support me through donations, and in return I offer you amazing rewards!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<p>By donating, you are supporting me to continue my practice. It would be really nice to collect €1500, but it is even better to reach more!</p>
<p>The perks I'm offering are items I particularly designed for this crowdfunding. All profit I make out of selling these, goes straight to my little company. I've tried my best to keep my prices as low as possible so everybody would get the opportunity to choose something they really like!</p>

Hi!
My name is Loulou João. I am an illustrator from Belgium with a passion for embroidery. While I'm still pursuing my studies, I run a little company to promote and sell my artwork: longlasting and wearable apparel, accessories and hopefully much more to come!
I hope that one day my business can grow to become a fulltime activity. Your help will get me closer to this dream! By reaching my goal, I'll be able to get some funds back after the purchase of  my own embroidery machine that I will use to expand my brand. You can support me through donations, and in return I offer you amazing rewards!
 

By donating, you are supporting me to continue my practice. It would be really nice to collect €1500, but it is even better to reach more!
The perks I'm offering are items I particularly designed for this crowdfunding. All profit I make out of selling these, goes straight to my little company. I've tried my best to keep my prices as low as possible so everybody would get the opportunity to choose something they really like!
If I don't reach my entire goal, I'll still have some funds to put in to making more products. Every donation helps! Let's take a look at the perks you can get!

1. PATCHES
These patches are the first perk I offer. It's an iron-on patch, making very easy to attach on fabric and give it that something extra. Diameter +/- 6 cm.

<p> </p>
<p>Lisa and I started in Artist Alley as little known artists with a desire to go big! We ventured into uncharted territory with Salt Lake Comic Con being our first convention. Armed with a smile and Kinko prints we took on the waves of 100,000 people cramming the aisles for new things to buy. We learned so much from that first show and continued our quest to become better than before! Since then we've sold art at several Comic Cons all across the country and are looking to level up our game by adding t-shirts, onesies and more. </p>
<center><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1502161823/dytzhzydjqrqakumyeee.png"" src="""" style=""""/></center>
<p> </p>
<p>We were originally selling to a part of the market that we felt was lacking gamer related stuff, and that was our littlest gamers, babies! Henceforth, Level1Gamers was born! But we thought, why stop there? Parents need gamer related stuff too, so we created adult sized t-shirts as well! We've covered topics from video gaming to role-playing and everything in-between. </p>
<p>Our passion has created a loyal fan base online and here is what some of them have to say from Etsy:</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">It's time to change the story on assault and violence.</h3>
<p>The G|B Defender by Guardian Band is getting fear off your mind by putting safety in your hands. </p>
<p>The G|B Defender is the only smartwatch on the market that streams live video, audio, and GPS location via a 4G cellular network with just a touch of the SOS button. When every second counts, there’s no need to fumble through apps, scroll through screens, or even pull out your phone. Pressing the easily accessible SOS button alerts your Guardian Network of your GPS location and starts streaming live video that can help identify your attacker. Best of all, the G|B Defender isn’t Bluetooth dependent. With its own SIM card and number, it doesn’t need a nearby cell phone to operate. </p>
<p>The annual statistics of assault and violence around the world are staggering: </p>
<ul>
<li>Every 92 seconds, an American is sexually assaulted. (1) </li>
<li>The FBI filed 424,066 missing-children reports in 2018. (2) </li>
<li>20% ER visits by senior adults are due to assault or neglect. One-fourth of serious nursing home cases of abuse are not reported to police. (3) </li>
<li>482 cases of sexual assault from a ride-share driver have been reported since 2014. (4) One ride-share company received 7 different lawsuits for sexual assault in JUST ONE DAY.  (5) </li>
<li>23% of female and 5% of male undergraduates experience rape or sexual assault during their college tenure. (6) </li>
</ul>
<p>It is time to change these statistics. It's time to stop living in fear. It's time for the G|B Defender.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Our Campaign and Goals</h3>
<p>Guardian Band's campaign goal is to raise $500,000. With these funds we can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continue to hone the G|B Defender's interface and software to ensure it will always be both cutting-edge and user friendly. </li>
<li>Continue researching and developing a child-specific version of the G|B Defender to address the safety concerns that affect our kids. </li>
<li>Keep up with design and style trends so that wearing the G|B Defender will not only keep you safe, you'll look good while doing it.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><strong>We have all become aware of the threats that worry college students walking at night, parents dropping kids at the mall, people entering a ride share, elderly people in nursing homes, real estate agents meeting potential clients, and even hotel workers entering a guest’s room.</strong> But consequences for rapists and assailants are still discouragingly low. Only 6% of rapists will ever spend a day in jail, and 15 out of 16 rapist will walk free. (7)</p>
<p><u>The G|B Defender works to change these statistics in three ways: </u></p>
<p>1. Prevention. Studies in criminology show that attacks are much less likely to occur if the assailants know they are being filmed. </p>
<p>2. Rescue. A quick touch of the SOS fires off your GPS location and begins streaming live video/audio alerting your Guardian Network that you need help. You don't even have to say a word. </p>
<p>3. Evidence. Once activated, your Guardian Network captures video, audio, and your GPS location on their GB Defender app, which can be handed over to authorities to help incriminate and prosecute your assailant. </p>
<p>In addition, Guardian Band is partnering with A Call to Men and NO MORE, two non-profit organizations working tirelessly to change the worldwide culture of assault and violence. With each G|B Defender sold, Guardian Band will donate 2.5% of the proceeds to each of these organizations. </p>
<p>By contributing to our campaign, you are changing the outcomes of assault and violence for victims all over the world. </p>
<h3>Fashionably Fearless</h3>
<p>The G|B Defender is a heavyweight in technology, but it’s lightweight on your arm while tracking your daily steps. With the G|B Defender, you can make and receive calls, take photos, count your steps, monitor your heartbeat and more. Its sleek, streamlined design looks great as you count your steps from the laundry room to the boardroom to the taproom. The G|B Defender comes in 3 color choices and is packaged with a backup quick-charge battery small enough to attach to your keychain. In addition, Guardian Band is partnering with name-brand designers to create a range of custom and limited edition watchband styles so you can change up your look as easily as you change your plans. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Our Background</h3>
<p>Guardian Band started on a treadmill at the gym. Sweating through a workout, Lisa Geyer recognized a friend being interviewed on the overhead TV. That's how Lisa found out one of her friends had been sexually assaulted by a rideshare driver. What was worse, the assailant was never identified. Angry and frustrated, Lisa channeled her energy into developing the most powerful wearable safety device on the market today.  </p>
<p>With 20 years experience in setting up and running national and international businesses and non-profit organizations, Lisa was uniquely situated to recruit the best engineers and technology experts from all over the world. Countless hours of research and development have resulted in the brand-new powerful technology only offered by the G|B Defender. </p>
<h3>Our Future</h3>
<p>We realize how quickly technology changes and evolves. Since we began developing the G|B Defender, we have already been able to improve the efficiency of our technology in ways we could never dream of two years ago. Our engineers are dedicated to the Guardian Band goals  and continue to research and develop improvements to ensure we deliver the most reliable, current, and cutting-edge product to our customers. </p>
<p>The cultural impact of streaming video has unlimited possibilities. Our goal is to partner with communities all over the country to help vulnerable populations feel safe, protected, and empowered.</p>

Greg, borderline reckless, challenged the conventional norm, and started a skate brand called Peg. Marsh, a bit more cautious, started flying helicopters in Africa. So starting a global sunglasses business would be easy. Not really, but they did it anyway.Today Mawu has 4 warehouses located across the globe in the USA, UK, Australia and South Africa.Mawu sunglasses are handcrafted with acetate; a natural plant based material – the highest quality material for eyeglasses. This material is comfortable to wear, feels good and looks even better. Acetate is strong, lightweight and highly flexible, which means the shades can be shaped and reshaped for the perfect fit. Oh, and it’s also made from renewable materials. Our metal frames are electroplated stainless steel, made to withstand life on the go. Nobody wants flimsy shades when they're living audaciously.Check out our video on how to reshape your Mawu sunglasses - because every face is unique.Our CR39 Polarized lenses provide 400 UVA + UVB protection, enhancing visibility, reducing sun glare and blocking out harmful UV rays from the sun.We create eyewear for the audacious. But who are the audacious? It’s those people who are willing to tell their story their way, through living a life of epic experiences.From hitch hiking through Africa, cliff jumping in the Philippines, kayaking with whales in Alaska to shredding the streets on your board or creating art in your city – Mawu wants to experience these moments with you. Mawu provides you with supreme quality polarized sunglasses, which enhance the colors and details of your surroundings, allowing you to live audaciously.We've created a whole range of different styles to suit all kinds of audacious lifestyles and personalities. While anyone can enjoy the supreme quality and unique style of Mawu eyewear, wearers can enjoy a distinctive product that is not owned by everyone on the street. Because not everyone is unique.We are offering you outrageous prices on our current range, which is warehoused and ready to ship across 5 locations around the globe. We've done all the hard work, but now we need you...We're almost there...We don’t want to be like other luxury sunglasses brands, or even try and appeal to everyone like them. We only want to live alongside the audacious.We've done everything we can to build an epic product — now we need you to join us in the next chapter of our journey.How can you help?Back us by supporting our Indiegogo campaign and choosing a style of our epic shades at a smashing once off offer.

<h3>Meet Prisca Nnko</h3>
<p>She is a self-taught Tanzanian designer who learned her craft by watching online tutorial videos and improving her artistry one bag at a time. She started out on a very old second-hand sewing machine and quickly learned different techniques to handle the kitenge (African printed textile) and turn it into colourful and affordable bags for everyday use. Prisca is the only designer in her family. This means that she makes decisions about her craft alone. She invests what she earns to improve her infrastructure and to steadily grow her range of products. She has accumulated significant tacit knowledge over the past years and is looking forward to exchange her experience with other designers. </p>

<p>Prislo is handmade, simple and functional. The prints are carefully selected and there is a conscious intention behind the colours and textures of each bag.</p>

<h3>What do we want to achieve?</h3>
<p>With your support, we want Prisca to gain more experience making bags with other designers in Europe. We want her to travel to Germany for 2 months to visit bag companies, look at their infrastructure, and exchange with other designers and manufacturers. She will also share with the European designers her sensibility for colour and patterns. It’s important that Prisca learns more about quality control early on and identifies the machinery that will help her work more efficiently.</p>
<p>Your help will contribute to 2 main goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Goal 1 &gt;&gt;&gt; To improve Prisca’s technical skills and influence her design with new ideas, and patterns while in Germany</li>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>What we need</h3>
<p>We need €3,500 to allow Prisca to travel to Germany for 2 months (mid-June through mid August 2018). This amount will be used to purchase her roundtrip flights and to cover all related expenses such as visa and health insurance. This sum also includes the cost associated with her stay in Germany such as accommodation, local transportation and food allowance. Prisca will self-fund 10% of the total amount donated. She has already invested in her line of products, your contribution will boost her effort and help her gain more experience locally and abroad.</p>

The uniforms will be the front and center of our brand.</p><p>• <u>Give back</u>: This is most important and the reason we want to do this. We are committed to the health, safety and welfare of all veterans, so 10% of all sales will be donated to support veterans.

We believe military uniforms are priceless and something to be treasured. Each uniform has a different story, but all have been worn by individuals with the same core values of honor, courage and commitment. Civvies offers a unique opportunity to wear high-quality apparel, designed with a piece of history while supporting our veterans. Our apparel is designed with military uniforms actually worn by men and women during their service to our great nation. 10% of each sale is donated to benefit our Veterans.    Our message is a call for everyone to recognize and thank our heroes and their families for their sacrifices. Help us give back a little to those who gave us a lot.Upcycling uniforms on pocket teesWho We AreWe are average Americans who appreciate the sacrifices and enjoy the freedom made possible by our men and women in uniform. We are not veterans but this doesn’t stop us from doing our part to support those who wore the uniforms. We understand that the privilege to wear a uniform must be earned, and that’s why we pay homage to each member of the service who wore the uniform. We are not attempting to allow those who have not served to be imposters. We deeply respect every service member’s sacrifice and have taken great care to ensure each piece is selected to pay tribute to military service, not replicate it. Our mission is to get everyone involved, give back and support our veterans while looking stylish doing it.Why we do itSimply, because we care. We believe it is a great way to connect with our veterans by reusing their uniforms on high-quality apparel. It's our way of giving back.Steve Vargas, a Veteran, twice elected council member, and congressional candidate, donated his uniform.How we will do it• Create a community: We want to hear from our veterans. We will work on connecting with our veterans, ask them to share their stories and/or send us their uniforms to be used for our apparel.• Collect uniforms: We found out that a lot of used uniforms sadly end up where they don’t belong - thrown away, in the bottom of closets, collecting dust in the garage, etc. These uniforms and who wore them need to be recognized for their service.• Upcycle and design: We will start with tees and hats and subsequently begin to develop our brand through further designs and apparel offerings. The uniforms will be the front and center of our brand.• Give back: This is most important and the reason we want to do this. We are committed to the health, safety and welfare of all veterans, so 10% of all sales will be donated to support veterans. Each month we will select one of our heroes' story to publish and showcase it with every purchase. Ten percent of sales for that month will go to his or her choice of charity (a list of the leading service provider organizations that will be determined once our brand is funded).Thus farWe have received enormous support from veterans and are excited about the future. To date, we’ve produced t-shirts and trucker hats. We have already tested materials, designs and suppliers and we’ve developed a website to start our mission. We have a good start but we still have a long way to go.Below are the reward styles:Styles For HimHonor Pocket TeeFreedom Flag TeeHeritage Flag TeeStyles For HerHonor Pocket TeeFreedom Flag TeeHeritage Flag TeePledge Tank Legacy Trucker Hatfor Him & Her Going forward The funds will be used for: 
Producing our initial collection line of tees and hats 
Developing our brand through further designs and apparel offerings 
Developing a professional website for our community, including e-commerce 
Deploying our online marketing strategy
Note: The 10% is built in to our business model. Your backing will indirectly support our veterans by allowing us to build a larger platform to make this 10% have a great future impact.Risks and challengesIf we can meet our goal, we can quickly scale the message and shirts through our online advertising strategy. Civvies relies on small suppliers and craftsmen, so if we receive a lot of orders we could experience a slight slowdown in order to scale up the production process. Also, our production might be limited as each shirt is made with reused uniforms, so each shirt ordered is custom-made and will vary based on materials/uniforms available.Thank you for checking out our campaign!

<p>On their first trip together she forgot her neck pillow.</p>
<p>It made it hard to sleep and they both arrived unrested and exhausted, unable to enjoy the day.</p>

Traveling doesn’t have to mean pulling out the cargo shorts from the back of your drawer or wearing that bulky jacket you bought 10 years ago that you only use for international flights.
Own the jacket that’s not only great for travel...but one you’d want to wear year-round. 
 No matter how you travel, be the alpha.
Alpha Jacket is perfect for the forgetful traveler, the chic business exec, or the wandering nomad. 
Durable, fashionable, and with convenient pockets designed for everyday use.

The fashionable travel jacket built not just for a comfortable flight, but a comfortable adventure.
You don’t want 100 features that lead to awkward bulges and bulky pockets.
You just want what you need.
 Reduce your stress: Sleep better in transit with our comfortable (and detachable) memory foam neck pillow. The jacket will keep you cozy and warm on those cold long flights.
  Turn heads on the tarmac instead of turning into a fashion-disaster: Fashion-forward, utilitarian, and high-quality materials. Detachable hood turns the jacket into a bomber perfect for everyday city use.

 Have everything you need that’s essential to a fun trip - keep your wallet handy, your passport safe, and your AirPods at the ready for those loud talkers (and heavy snorers).

For everyday commuting & long extended trips

Exactly what you need for a great adventure.
  Detachable hood & ergonomic memory foam neck pillow- Easily remove the pillow after sleeping. Detach the entire hood to transform the jacket into a bomber. 

 Secure pockets - Stop fretting about losing the thing that’s hardest to replace

 Power Bank Pocket - Keep your phone charged and never miss another perfect moment.

 Slim-view water bladder - For hikes, biking, or long walks down the riviera

 Secure keys pocket - Don’t get locked out of your rental

PinFin has partnered with one of the top apparel manufacturers in Vietnam. Along with sourcing our fabric, embellishments, and zippers directly from the suppliers. No middlemen! We have dialed in our lead time and are excited to start our first production run. 

The inspiration behind the jacket
Dan, the founder of PinFin, travels a lot with his wife.  

On their first trip together she forgot her neck pillow.
It made it hard to sleep and they both arrived unrested and exhausted, unable to enjoy the day.
It didn’t help that current travel neck pillows are big, bulky and are a pain to carry around. They are the pinnacle of “useful yet ugly” products.
So Dan thought - why don’t we come up with a way to easily sleep and look good on the trip? 

The idea quickly evolved, focusing in on the key principles of design as simple and beautiful.

Pinfin was created, centered around our vision to create innovative, useful, and fashionable wear that has infinite uses. 

 

Dan and his wife Linh have spent the last two years building the Alpha jacket. Sourcing every component directly from every source. They have partnered with one of the top apparel manufacturers in Vietnam. A passionate couple, eager to deliver you the best travel jacket on the market, promises to maintain a consistent and transparent line of communication to their loyal backers.Support their project today and be one of the first to travel like an Alpha.

<h2>Algara's Smart Journey</h2>
<p>From design to prototypes and now testing, we have certainly
come a long way. With your help, we’re excited to lead this next evolution in
electronic fashion jewelry design. </p>
<h2>Where We Stand</h2>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>After more than 12 months of hard work, we have finally completed the
design phase and are in the process of completing all technical testing
requirements. Since ALGARA is packed with so many features we can’t wait to
include, we’re taking the time to test more features out before handing the
specs over to our manufacturer. We are definitely proud of the progress we’ve
made this year and can’t wait to get the ALGARA to you by
the scheduled delivery timeline of April 2015. </p>
<p></p>

<h2><b>Help
Make Fashion History</b></h2>
<p>We are turning to the Indiegogo
community for your participation in making fashion
history. We are asking this awesome international community to support
ALGARA because we have designed it just for you. We want to listen to your
feedback, suggestions and source for more ideas because we believe this is all
part of the creative process. Besides your help in realizing the contribution
goal, any other ideas or input will be greatly appreciated to accelerate and
bring this groundbreaking product into mass production.</p>
<p>From drawings to realization, we
have partnered up with the best manufacturers in mobile electronic and fashion
jewelry, so let’s make history together! </p>
<p><b style=""font-size: 30px; letter-spacing: 1px; line-height: 38px;"">Let’s
Work Together</b><br/></p>
<p>We have spent a great deal of time
in research and development, as well as designing the look and feel of the
brand. With your help, we aim to provide a better user experience by
integrating the app, user interface and develop more features on the ALGARA
Mobile App. With more resources for R&amp;D, we can improve and integrate
better applications and services to the ALGARA core and collection of designer
accessories. We are always open to creative ideas, so please contact us at support@jewelectric.comand tell us how you’ll love to use your
ALGARA. </p>
<h2>Meet The Team</h2>
<p>The ALGARA team is comprised of jewelry designers with
decades of experience, passionate engineers, app developers and marketing
professionals. We don’t mean to brag, but if you add up all our years of
experience, that comes up to be an impressive century of development experience
in gemstone jewelry and consumer electronic design. We mean business when it
comes to bringing an evolution of wearable smart jewelry to fashionistas around
the world.</p>

<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>After more than a year, we are now getting ALGARA ready for
commercial production. </p>
<p>Extensive testing and experience has prepared the team for
challenges during the transfer process. We have plans to mitigate all these
risks and have enlisted a brilliant team on our board to provide the essential
expertise. </p>
<h2>Manufacturing </h2>
<p>The most time-consuming step will be tooling. This process
is complex and requires time. Most of the budget from contributions will be
spent on this stage. With enough resources, complications that emerge can be
quickly resolved and prevent delays to the production schedule. To mitigate
these risks, we've collaborated with a prolific technical manufacturing
partner, who will work closely with the design team throughout the
manufacturing process.</p>
<h2>Software Application </h2>

<br/>
</div>
<p>We still have work to do building all the features we want
to include in the ALGARA ecosystem. Software development can be tricky when
ideas go wild and we’re trying to pack all these awesome features into a
central application system. It’s taking a longer time than expected and that’s
why we need your help, alongside our very capable team of software developers.
There are risks, but we’ve been managing well, keeping challenges to a minimal
level and are on track with our plans. </p>

Wireless Power Charging



Forget about messing around with cables when you can enjoy
the ease of wirelessly charging anytime, anywhere and automatically via
Bluetooth. Every ALGARA system comes with its own wireless power charger and
USB cable. Simply connect the charger to a power source, pop out the stone core
from the O-Mount casing and place it on the inductive charger. The stone core
will be fully charged overnight or if you prefer, set your ALGARA to charge
wirelessly while still wearing it.

Algara's Smart Journey
From design to prototypes and now testing, we have certainly
come a long way. With your help, we’re excited to lead this next evolution in
electronic fashion jewelry design. 
Where We Stand


After more than 12 months of hard work, we have finally completed the
design phase and are in the process of completing all technical testing
requirements. Since ALGARA is packed with so many features we can’t wait to
include, we’re taking the time to test more features out before handing the
specs over to our manufacturer. We are definitely proud of the progress we’ve
made this year and can’t wait to get the ALGARA to you by
the scheduled delivery timeline of April 2015. 



Help
Make Fashion History
We are turning to the Indiegogo
community for your participation in making fashion
history. We are asking this awesome international community to support
ALGARA because we have designed it just for you. We want to listen to your
feedback, suggestions and source for more ideas because we believe this is all
part of the creative process. Besides your help in realizing the contribution
goal, any other ideas or input will be greatly appreciated to accelerate and
bring this groundbreaking product into mass production.
From drawings to realization, we
have partnered up with the best manufacturers in mobile electronic and fashion
jewelry, so let’s make history together! 
Let’s
Work Together
We have spent a great deal of time
in research and development, as well as designing the look and feel of the
brand. With your help, we aim to provide a better user experience by
integrating the app, user interface and develop more features on the ALGARA
Mobile App. With more resources for R&D, we can improve and integrate
better applications and services to the ALGARA core and collection of designer
accessories. We are always open to creative ideas, so please contact us at support@jewelectric.comand tell us how you’ll love to use your
ALGARA.

Risks & Challenges
After more than a year, we are now getting ALGARA ready for
commercial production. 
Extensive testing and experience has prepared the team for
challenges during the transfer process. We have plans to mitigate all these
risks and have enlisted a brilliant team on our board to provide the essential
expertise. 
Manufacturing 
The most time-consuming step will be tooling. This process
is complex and requires time. Most of the budget from contributions will be
spent on this stage. With enough resources, complications that emerge can be
quickly resolved and prevent delays to the production schedule. To mitigate
these risks, we've collaborated with a prolific technical manufacturing
partner, who will work closely with the design team throughout the
manufacturing process.
Software Application 




We still have work to do building all the features we want
to include in the ALGARA ecosystem. Software development can be tricky when
ideas go wild and we’re trying to pack all these awesome features into a
central application system. It’s taking a longer time than expected and that’s
why we need your help, alongside our very capable team of software developers.
There are risks, but we’ve been managing well, keeping challenges to a minimal
level and are on track with our plans.

Organic cork material in our backpack is as strong, durable and resistant to outside elements as leather is but with the additional advantage of being three times lighter than leather. 
We combine the highest quality materials and the craftsmanship to make our bags so you can proudly carry it around for many years. Montage bags are made to last.


Premium Portuguese cork that we use for our bags, is highly water resistant so it can be worn in the rain with confidence. 
  
 We use premium Portuguese cork that is completely organic and ethically harvested. Our vegan leather is about 3 times lighter than leather while it is as durable & resistant as leather. Harvesting the bark from cork tree does not harm the tree (no trees are cut down during the harvesting process), in fact it lets the tree breathe and release more oxygen so it can grow healthier!
Available in three eye-catching colors.
After each harvest the Cork tree fully regenerates within 7 to 9 years after harvest. The process extends the life of the tree by 200 years. This wonderful material is completely organic, sustainable, vegan, and eco friendly. 

For every bag you pledge, a tree will be planted through our partner, Kijani Forestry. And we will share every step of this planting progress with our Kickstarter updates.

<p>Hey there, we're Noire Velvet.</p>
<p>This is our story: the creator has a friend who often complained to her how difficult it was for her to get into regular store and buy a single top or even pants since she wears XL. One day, she decided to go shopping  to get that friend a birthday gift, and even after doing several stores in a very well reknown place in PARIS (CHATELET LES HALLES), she couldn't find any top, dress or even pants that was over L size. She felt desperate and through this event understood and decided to do something about it, and change the way plus size women are left aside by big brands.</p>
<p>As women, we've noticed that it's often difficult to find our size with major clothing brands. As soon as you're considered ""plus size"", you have to get to a different shop. That's not normal. Women shouldn't be ostracized because of their size. We want all women to have access to the same products, no matter their build.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our garment are not only in wax clothes, we will make regular clothing such as Jeans, velvet fabric, plaine cotton fabric, mix and match items.</p>
<p>What we're offering is a wider sizing chart than the usual ones, from 10 to 22 for the UK and 4 to 18 for the US.</p>

Why do you stand it? You deserve the best!You should wear natural clothes. We believe that it is very important!We offer only handmade down-filled products, natural from Orenburg down.Garments and accessories from the wool of the Orenburg goats are made from natural and ecologically clean raw materials grown without the use of chemicals.

MADE WITH LOVE. Products from natural Orenburg fluff are the embodiment of tenderness and comfort. They absorbed the warmth of the hands and the kindness of the needlewoman, the softness of our rivers and power of mountains.Orenburg area has always been famous for knitting shawls from the wool. It is an ancient craft, which originated in the Orenburg region about 250 years ago.Orenburg goats fluff is the thinnest in the world. Therefore, products made of Orenburg fluff especially gentle and soft. That is why the Orenburg fluff is called “a soft gold”.However, the fluff is very strong - stronger than wool. Orenburg downy goats are unique. On formation of the valuable wool has affected the climate of our region. Winters are strong with winds and hard frosts (fluff to – 400F) and summers are very hot (1040F). This difference of extreme temperatures and climate formed a long, solid, very thin, extremely soft and silky fluff.Why the clothes from the wool of these unique goats are not spread everywhere?The problem is that the process of creating this handmade shawl is not fast and difficult.For the month a knitter can link two webs of medium size or three tippets. The manufacturing of large size scarf or kerchief with pattern or inscription takes a month or more.The creation process of down products. We scratch fluff from goats in early February and then in March repeat the procedure with the help of special combs.Then fluff carefully washed, cleaned and dried, and in the summer all the fluff additionally washed in the waters of the cold mountain river. The water in it is very soft and it gives our fluff even more tenderness.We knit shawl from a specially-prepared yarn: first, the fluff is scratched and spun a thin, strong thread made of goat down, and then cheat on strings of silk that held its shape. Really warm and lightweight shawl will work only from the correct thread. And only after that you can start tinkering and bring to life your fantasies.The final stage is a drying process of down products. For this we use special wooden frames. On the frame put a wet handkerchief, gently stretching the cloth, and left to dry at room temperature. This is one of the most important steps, because if the product does not pull, it is deformed and reduced in size.Shawl (or scarf) at first doesn't look fluffy. Products start getting fluffy after some time.Each scarf is an original artwork, which required a lot of creative work and patience.

Think: dressed up, not buttoned up, day-to-date wear, with a price point you can afford. Plus, it’s made in the USA and is designed with and for women, to encourage women, and to support women.</p><p><i>Make each day a little more inspired, a little easier, and much more emboldened.</i></p><h2> </h2><h2>The vision</h2><p>When I launched Cotton Canary, I had two goals in mind: to design clothing that dresses the every-day woman as the modern superwoman that she is, and gives women more of a say in fashion.</p><p>While the world has changed to bring more equality and empowerment to women, fashion in the workplace is still very stifled. We default to suits or been-there, done-that pants with button-down shirts.</p><p>I say it’s time to celebrate femininity while maintaining the girl boss edge and have a polished look that transitions seamlessly from boardroom to bar.</p><p>It’s also time to bring the woman’s voice into the design process. Let’s make the evolution of our personal style a bit more, well…evolved. You should participate in how collections are put together and weigh in on the fit, color, and style you need and want.</p><p>This concept is virtually non-existent in the fashion industry, and yet it offers so many advantages. By selling directly to you and sidestepping the retailers, we are able to balance quality with affordability and offer collections at a below-market price. A $100 dress purchased through Cotton Canary would cost you almost double at a retail shop, because we have cut out the middle man. </p><p>We have also cut out the waste. Not carrying an inventory means we relieve the pressure of producing as cheaply as possible and the practice of trying to offload products that don't sell. Our model is demand-driven, and it allows us to focus more on the quality of each piece to bring you a limited edition design. </p><p>All of these ambitions come to life in Cotton Canary. I have bootstrapped the development of this clothing line with my own savings and business background until now. But like any ambitious undertaking, the brand needs more resources.</p><p>It typically takes at least two seasons to build a following strong enough to give a fashion brand its wings. I have set a goal of $46,500 to help fuel Cotton Canary to launch and maintain sustainability. With your support, we will reach and surpass that goal so that we can continue to ramp up operations and deliver more of the clothes you’ll love.</p><p> </p><h2><strong>Breakdown of how the money will be spent</strong></h2><p>You work hard for your money, and it’s important you know exactly how your donation will be used:</p><ul>
<li><u>100% of your donation will be used to fuel the brand and operations.</u></li>

<li>…fashion, like other industries, needs to be more democratic, and more fine-tuned to what women, like you, need. Cotton Canary wants to give the choice of fashion back into rightful hands -- yours.</li>
<li>…you refuse to struggle with the office wear dilemma: professional but stiff and unfeminine; quality but at an unaffordable price; inexpensively made and barely lasts a season; not cute enough for post-work play; and the list goes on!</li>
<li>…you’d rather not spend a fortune on dry cleaning.</li>
<li>…we want to make our collections with you. Your voice is the most important element – let’s design together.</li>

From day one, Cotton Canary will provide a portion of its proceeds to provide financial assistance to families seeking to adopt kids and to help break women and children out of human trafficking.</p><p> </p><h2>Timeline and the fun stuff</h2><p><u>BRAND</u></p><p>With your support, we are excited to celebrate these milestones together:</p><ul>

Think: dressed up, not buttoned up, day-to-date wear, with a price point you can afford. Plus, it’s made in the USA and is designed with and for women, to encourage women, and to support women.Make each day a little more inspired, a little easier, and much more emboldened. The visionWhen I launched Cotton Canary, I had two goals in mind: to design clothing that dresses the every-day woman as the modern superwoman that she is, and gives women more of a say in fashion.While the world has changed to bring more equality and empowerment to women, fashion in the workplace is still very stifled. We default to suits or been-there, done-that pants with button-down shirts.I say it’s time to celebrate femininity while maintaining the girl boss edge and have a polished look that transitions seamlessly from boardroom to bar.It’s also time to bring the woman’s voice into the design process. Let’s make the evolution of our personal style a bit more, well…evolved. You should participate in how collections are put together and weigh in on the fit, color, and style you need and want.This concept is virtually non-existent in the fashion industry, and yet it offers so many advantages. By selling directly to you and sidestepping the retailers, we are able to balance quality with affordability and offer collections at a below-market price. A $100 dress purchased through Cotton Canary would cost you almost double at a retail shop, because we have cut out the middle man. We have also cut out the waste. Not carrying an inventory means we relieve the pressure of producing as cheaply as possible and the practice of trying to offload products that don't sell. Our model is demand-driven, and it allows us to focus more on the quality of each piece to bring you a limited edition design. All of these ambitions come to life in Cotton Canary. I have bootstrapped the development of this clothing line with my own savings and business background until now. But like any ambitious undertaking, the brand needs more resources.It typically takes at least two seasons to build a following strong enough to give a fashion brand its wings. I have set a goal of $46,500 to help fuel Cotton Canary to launch and maintain sustainability. With your support, we will reach and surpass that goal so that we can continue to ramp up operations and deliver more of the clothes you’ll love. Breakdown of how the money will be spentYou work hard for your money, and it’s important you know exactly how your donation will be used:
100% of your donation will be used to fuel the brand and operations.
Zero percent of your gift will be used to pay a salary for me.
More specifically:
You--Front and Center (Creating a Platform To Hear All Your Ideas For Design): $6,000
The Fun Part (Garment Design, Pattern Making, Perfecting the Fit): $12,500
No Emperor’s New Clothes Here (Fabric Sourcing and Perfecting the Fit): $5,000
Seeing is Believing (Photo Shoot, plus Web Design, UX Testing): $8,500
How You’ll Hear About Us (Marketing): $10,000
Bow On Top (Packaging): $4,500
Whatever you can give is appreciated and so very helpful.  You and Cotton CanaryYou care about this because…
…fashion, like other industries, needs to be more democratic, and more fine-tuned to what women, like you, need. Cotton Canary wants to give the choice of fashion back into rightful hands -- yours.
…you refuse to struggle with the office wear dilemma: professional but stiff and unfeminine; quality but at an unaffordable price; inexpensively made and barely lasts a season; not cute enough for post-work play; and the list goes on!
…you’d rather not spend a fortune on dry cleaning.
…we want to make our collections with you. Your voice is the most important element – let’s design together.
…And we have ambitions outside of ourselves as well. From day one, Cotton Canary will provide a portion of its proceeds to provide financial assistance to families seeking to adopt kids and to help break women and children out of human trafficking. Timeline and the fun stuffBRANDWith your support, we are excited to celebrate these milestones together:
September 15: Our fundraising goes live and you good folks donate!
October 6: We close our fundraising shop and shift gears to...
October 10: The inaugural collection launch (yay!). 
PERKSWe are impatient to give you perks for your good deed of the day. Once the fundraising has ended, we will contact you to claim your prize! Stay tuned for updates towards the end of the campaign and continue passing on the word about Cotton Canary. THANK YOU!THANK YOU for your support, your encouragement, and your participation. It really does mean the world to us. We are grateful to have you join our movement.Once you have donated, share your new donor title (see more in Perks) on social media and inspire others to join your ranks.

<h3>The Boots on the Ground in Detroit</h3>
<p>Our team of designers, artists, engineers, organizers, and entrepreneurs are working together to hire and train veterans to become boot makers in Detroit. We started Pingree Mfg., a worker-owned company, with the primary objective of employing veterans to make and sell durable, sustainable, versatile boots and gear as rugged and resilient as the city they are forged in. </p>
<p>We have outgrown the basements we are working out of in Detroit and are ready to get our veteran crafters trained and working full-time.We have acquired the majority of our materials and a portion of equipment necessary to get fully up and running and have secured a production location in Detroit that needs minimal renovations.  All we need now is this initial funding. </p>

<p>All profit generated from the sales of these boots go towards getting veterans to work building boots in Detroit. Estimated Shipping by Spring 2017</p>
<h3><strong>HERE IS WHERE YOU COME IN</strong></h3>
<p>Every dollar will amplify our ability to transform the lives of veterans in Detroit. Funds from this crowd funding campaign will enable us to produce this limited 1st run of 500 unisex pairs of both our <i>Detroit Classic</i> boot &amp; the <i>Resurget Recondo</i> boot made in Michigan. This capital will also quicken our pace for hiring and training our full team of veteran crafters and getting our operation fully functional.</p>
<p>We believe anything is possible &amp; if you see a better way, find a way to make it happen. With your support, we see an opportunity in Detroit to make high-quality, veteran-made footwear &amp; gear that redefines sustainability and maximizes the health and well being of our workforce, our neighbors, and our customers.</p>
<h3>COMFORT &amp; FIT</h3>
<p>Pingree boots fit true to size. For example, if you measure as an 9 on a Brannock device (those metal devices used at nearly every shoe store), we suggest you purchase an 9. We recommend a snug fit as the leather and midsole will stretch and conform to your foot. All widths are D, which accommodates most feet. Because of limited tooling for the 1st run we are able to offer limited sizing options. We apologize if we don't have your size. We will work to produce a much wider range of shoe sizes including less common widths in future runs. </p>
<p>If you don't know your size and you don't feel like swinging by a shoe store, this <a href=""http://www.famousfootwear.com/shoe-size-chart"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">printable version of the Brannock device </a>will work.</p>
<p>Still ordered the wrong size? No worries. Simply send the boots back and let us take care of the shipping &amp; handling. <i>Note: </i>we can only afford to make this offer for unused shoes, so try to decide if they fit or not before you go on a month-long motorcycle trip or decide to hike the Appalachian Trail.</p>
<p>We will email you at the end of the campaign to collect your size information. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478818425/jryqde1lm2tzldhlnzw5.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>WHY BOOTS? </h3>
<p>No one knows boots like veterans do. With no capital, yet a clear idea of the kind of impact we wanted to make, we set out two years ago exploring ideas of what we could have our future veteran crafters hand-build sustainably and locally. We asked the questions, what could embody the rugged resilience of Detroiters, could employ veterans across Metro Detroit who want to work but don’t have an opportunity, and has no carbon “footprint”? Our answer; build boots for the region as tough as the workers who make them!</p>
<h3>WHY VETERANS?</h3>
<p>Every company or organization could benefit from the discipline and mission driven nature of those who have served. Our focus on a veteran workforce took shape two years ago when our co-founder Jarret A. Schlaff met Mike, a young Marine veteran on Woodward avenue in downtown, who asked him for change to cover busfare so he could get home. This veteran had been out dropping off resumes and going from business to business all day and for months. He had been in and out of stable work for the previous three years. His home was his car at the time. After this connection Jarret spent weeks sitting down and talking with a number of veterans' organizations across Metro Detroit. He learned there was an unacceptable gap in gainful employment opportunities for veterans. So instead of waiting for someone else to do something about it, he decided to be part of the solution and started Project Boots on the Ground that has since grown into Pingree Mfg. </p>
<h3>WHY THE NAME?</h3>
<p>Hazen S. Pingree, trailblazer of progressive social reform, fought for the city of Detroit as a brilliant bootmaker, businessman and Republican mayor, after his service in the Civil War. In his time as Mayor, following exemplary Union service and the establishment of his boot company, Pingree and Smith, he exposed corporate corruption and made more food, transportation, and electricity publicly accessible in one of the city’s greatest times of need. The name embodies the kind of service, leadership, and action humanity needs at this time on the clock of the world.   </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478749117/wj5acxqo62d5fddmne3h.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>THE IMPACT</h3>
<p>Pingree Mfg is a worker-owned enterprise with a 501C3 non-profit and a L3C low-profit social impact arm to maximize the difference we make.</p>
<p>Having encountered countless highly qualified, educated, motivated yet still homeless vets, we founded Pingree Mfg on the idea that veterans are best suited to relate to and help other veterans achieve employment and stability.</p>
<p>We are creating transitional part-time work for 20-35 veterans with our street team and full-time employment and housing for 8-12 crafters who are on path to become co-owners of this enterprise over the next two years. Our team-based support systems house and create the context for our workers to heal from their trauma, to have a regained sense of purpose, and to contribute to a mission as large as ours. This creates a huge impact on local neighborhoods and families, and on their ability to be powerful messengers of the transformative potential of local resiliency.  </p>
<p>Full-time employees start at $15/hr and the initial 8-12 veterans we employ as crafters are put on path to worker-ownership, connected with stable and affordable housing, provided with 4-6 hours of paid leadership development &amp; financial literacy classes weekly, and supplemental health care.</p>
<h3><strong>SUSTAINABILITY</strong></h3>
<p>It makes sense to localize production and source our materials and labor locally to support American jobs, limit the costs and instability associated with global markets, and make a positive impact on our surrounding environment. We see opportunities moving forward to maximize well being while meeting the emerging demands of millions, by creating footwear and gear that are carbon neutral and toxic free.</p>
<p>We can’t depend on our government to get us to where we need to be, so we have the duty to create the localized resiliency and alternatives we seek.     </p>
<h3><strong>WHAT WE'VE DONE</strong></h3>
<p>Since the 1<sup>st</sup> crowd-funding campaign in 2015 where we raised $15k we have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supported pre-production operations for 1 year</li>
<li>Employed 3 veterans part-time</li>
<li>Produced &amp; market tested 3 generations of prototypes</li>
<li>Team members dedicated 1,400+ hours to research, product testing, and development</li>
<li>Acquired 30% of our production equipment</li>
<li>Obtained a majority of the materials necessary for production</li>
<li>Secured a production facility and have a storage facility for our reclaimed leather</li>
<li>Fostered partnerships with a footwear manufacturer in Michigan to mentor our team and co-produce 1<sup>st</sup> run of boots</li>
<li>Partnered with LEAR to reclaim their “scrap” leather and put it to good use</li>
<li>Created logo and branding for Pingree Mfg</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.detroitboots.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Created our new website</a></li>
<li>Hosted &amp; co-facilitated art therapy event in Detroit for 5 veterans</li>
<li>Finalist in the Pitch Detroit competition</li>
<li>Finalist in the Motor City Match Program</li>
</ul>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Quantity: The minimum run at our factory is 400 pairs per style. While we anticipate selling out in the first two weeks, if we don’t meet that threshold we may have to delay production for a short period until that quantity is reached.</p>
<p>Scale: Our social impact low profit business model has made it challenging to acquire traditional financing and investment. We are committed to maintaining the triple bottom-line focus of our enterprise without sacrificing the integrity or resiliency of our organization. This requires continued creativity, strong relationships, and perseverance to gain the necessary capital and expertise to scale our operations and remain profitable.  </p>
<p>Proven Leadership: Since 2007, our CEO has co-founded four non-profit organizations, all currently making a difference in economic, food, climate, and environmental justice across Metro Detroit. Our team has personally established regional relationships to garner in-kind donations of materials, equipment, services, and technical assistance for our boots organization valued over $250,000.</p>

<h3><span style=""font-size: 16px;line-height: 26px;background-color: initial;font-weight: normal;""> <p>I believe most parents have at one point had to deal with
their child leaving home with a jacket and not coming back with one. Children
of all ages don’t want to carry, wear, or stuff a jacket into to their backpack
in the compartment where the books and papers are. This makes it easy for them
to lose or leave the jacket behind. </p>
<p>We as parents want the best for our children and look out
for them best we can, high school and college are no exception. One day after
talking to some other parents, we agreed, that we want the security of knowing
our children has their jacket on hand if they need it, in case the weather or
temperature changes while they are away from home. That is what led me to
invent this stylish 2 in 1 backpack. A backpack that comes with and attached,
detachable jacket stored in its own compartment on the backside of the backpack. </p>
<p>This would also be so convenient for people with disabilities. Having
a disability myself, I’m familiar with not wanting to carry anything extra, but
needing to keep up with what I do carry with me. This clever backpack gives us two
important items used by many when they leave the house, a jacket and backpack
together. </p></span></h3>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 16px;line-height: 26px;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;font-weight: normal;"">This campaign is important to my family, friends, and I because so much was sacrificed and we believe in the good it will be for students, hikers, couriers, people who walk, ride bikes, travel by city buses, and more. I am fortunate to be able to now devote the time and energy needed to pursue our dreams of seeing the Jacket and Backpack Assembly on the market.</span></h3>
<ul> <li>With your contributions I will be able to get a prototype, some samples made, and attend at least one trade show. I will use any money left for any other business expenses.</li>
</ul>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <ul> <li>The funding of $30,000 will secure a manufacture to make a quality jacket and backpack Assembly and samples. It will also pay for me attending at least on trade show, and other business expenses.</li> <li>Though all donations in any amount are greatly appreciated, a sample of the Jacket and Backpack Assembly will be given to anyone who donates $150.00 or more. </li> <li>If we do not reach our goal we will start with what comes first, and that is securing a manufacturer that can have a prototype and samples made. Next get a business plan finished to go pitch to investors. We will proceed from there stretching the dollars as far as possible.</li> </ul>
<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <ul> <li>The Jacket and Backpack Assembly is valuable to anyone who knows what it is like to want to have a jacket on hand but don't want to wear, carry, or stuff it in your backpack, taking up valuable room in the main compartment. Together we will finally solve a problem that has troubled backpack wearers for years.</li> </ul>
<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Some things that will help me over come risks and obstacles I may face on the way to achieving my goal:</p> <ul> <li>The patent will give me some security with getting it out. </li>
<li>Being counseled helps keep me stay on track, provides me with important information, and gives me support. </li> </ul>
<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help. I know what it is like to want to help but you just are not financially equipped. There are other ways that you can help:</p> <ul> <li>I will greatly appreciate you spreading the word and asking people for their support, remember the sooner this gets on the market the sooner it will help so many.</li> <li>Please use the Indiegogo share tools to spread the word.</li>
<li>Also like us on Facebook and feel free to leave comments on how you feel about the Jacket and Backpack Assembly and share the page with all of your friends.</li>

in the compartment where the books and papers are. This makes it easy for them
to lose or leave the jacket behind. 
We as parents want the best for our children and look out
for them best we can, high school and college are no exception. One day after
talking to some other parents, we agreed, that we want the security of knowing
our children has their jacket on hand if they need it, in case the weather or
temperature changes while they are away from home. That is what led me to
invent this stylish 2 in 1 backpack. A backpack that comes with and attached,
detachable jacket stored in its own compartment on the backside of the backpack. 
This would also be so convenient for people with disabilities. Having
a disability myself, I’m familiar with not wanting to carry anything extra, but
needing to keep up with what I do carry with me. This clever backpack gives us two
important items used by many when they leave the house, a jacket and backpack
together. 
This campaign is important to my family, friends, and I because so much was sacrificed and we believe in the good it will be for students, hikers, couriers, people who walk, ride bikes, travel by city buses, and more. I am fortunate to be able to now devote the time and energy needed to pursue our dreams of seeing the Jacket and Backpack Assembly on the market.
 With your contributions I will be able to get a prototype, some samples made, and attend at least one trade show. I will use any money left for any other business expenses.

   What We Need & What You Get  The funding of $30,000 will secure a manufacture to make a quality jacket and backpack Assembly and samples. It will also pay for me attending at least on trade show, and other business expenses. Though all donations in any amount are greatly appreciated, a sample of the Jacket and Backpack Assembly will be given to anyone who donates $150.00 or more.  If we do not reach our goal we will start with what comes first, and that is securing a manufacturer that can have a prototype and samples made. Next get a business plan finished to go pitch to investors. We will proceed from there stretching the dollars as far as possible. 
   The Impact  The Jacket and Backpack Assembly is valuable to anyone who knows what it is like to want to have a jacket on hand but don't want to wear, carry, or stuff it in your backpack, taking up valuable room in the main compartment. Together we will finally solve a problem that has troubled backpack wearers for years. 
   Risks & Challenges Some things that will help me over come risks and obstacles I may face on the way to achieving my goal:  The patent will give me some security with getting it out. 
Being counseled helps keep me stay on track, provides me with important information, and gives me support.  
   Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help. I know what it is like to want to help but you just are not financially equipped. There are other ways that you can help:  I will greatly appreciate you spreading the word and asking people for their support, remember the sooner this gets on the market the sooner it will help so many. Please use the Indiegogo share tools to spread the word.
Also like us on Facebook and feel free to leave comments on how you feel about the Jacket and Backpack Assembly and share the page with all of your friends.
If you feel that you would be interested in being an investor please let me know and I will contact you with more information.
   Thank you in advance for donating, sharing the campaign, and for your overall support of the Jacket and Backpack Assembly!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Story behind the cards

A few months before the birth our boy (Noah), my wife and I were given a pack of Landmark Moment Cards. We flicked through them in anticipation of what parenthood had in store for us - we were delighted - parenting seemed dandy.
Now we have Noah (he's the crying baby in the video) and we love him to bits but, as you can see, he can be a bit of a butthead. And speaking to parent-friends of ours... it turns out that their babies could be too.
After the weeks and months went on, we wrote down all the situations Noah dumped us into; and that's when Honest Landmark Moments was born... as painful and unglamorous as it was.
Features


Each pack is made up of 38 cards.
The cards track all sorts of baby landmarks; from sleep deprivation to sharting and all sorts in-between.
The cards measure 15cm X 19cm.
They are gender neutral and make hilariously embarrassing keep-sakes.
Each of the 38 cards were conceived & written by Reid Leigh; and illustrated by  Eva M Steiner.


Why 10K?

It sounds like a lot, and it is. But the £10,000 will be put to good use:

PR and advertising to help spread the word.
Development of new editions.

<p>Hey Wanderer is a call to
those who are dreamers, thinkers, adventurers and believers. It’s a call to be
better. We are all wanderers. We are all looking for something off the beaten
path that will quench our thirst for knowledge, for being ahead, for being the
best, and for living out dreams. Hey Wanderer is asking you not to settle, not
to compromise, and to accept the struggle.</p>
<p>Behind Hey Wanderer, you can
rest assured that you will find honesty, transparency and mistakes. We hope to
inspire you to create, to dream, to lead, to follow, to think, to act and to
embrace your path.</p>
<p>The truth is, we all fall on
our faces, not finding what we are seeking because we are trapped by our choices
to do what is easy, instead of what is right. But what is right is simple. What
is right is gratifying. What is right can change the world. So, let’s the
change the world together!</p>

<h3>About our Name</h3>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The name Hey Wanderer emerged
from a text conversation between Savannah and Casey as they weighed the merits
of different ideas. While tossing ideas back and forth, the partners realized
that they both love the classic hymn, “Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing.” The
song contains the phrase ""prone to wander” – a sentiment that both women
could relate to and that they believed others would, as well. But, as further
lines in the song reveal, God binds his heart to us, no matter where we wander.
To the company’s owners, the name Hey Wanderer is a soothing reminder to all who
stray. You are understood. And you are safe here. </p>
<h3>Brand Story</h3>
<div>
<p>Hey Wanderer is a company
founded on friendship and creativity. Owners Casey Freeman and Savannah McNeill
met in 2011, waiting tables at a downtown Nashville restaurant. Savannah, a
native Texan, was a former art student, new to town; Casey, who hails from
Tennessee, was in nursing school. </p>
<p>They quickly became close,
bonding over their pursuit of beauty and truth. Those two touchstones marked their
first creative co-venture: a blog called Oh So Pretty the Diaries, featuring
beauty tutorials, fashion posts, DIY craft tips and recipes. Savannah and
Casey’s posts received broad exposure on Pinterest; at the height of Oh So
Pretty’s popularity, their instructional videos were getting as many as 200,000
page views a day.</p>
<p>The year 2014 brought change.
With the goal of assuming a more mature voice and broadening their coverage, they
agreed to call the blog Hey Wanderer. Charged with putting together a DIY post,
Savannah sewed a simple but luxurious kimono, which she then hand-dyed. They knew
they had something special. Savannah’s design instructions never made it online.
Hey Wanderer had become a fashion business.</p>
<p>Savannah got to work making
more kimonos, which they sold at pop-up sales. When the time came to expand
their production, they did so ethically, by employing members of Nashville’s
large refugee community.</p>
<p>They expanded their reach to
festivals, and continued to build their brand through the rest of 2014 and into
2015. Early that year, the launch of a Hey Wanderer Kickstarter campaign brought
a new round of customers and press recognition to Hey Wanderer. Sales continued
to grow. They began to explore wholesale.</p>
<p>Today, the women operate Hey
Wanderer out of the home they share in East Nashville. Last year, their house became
part of their operation: Savannah and Casey live and work on the first floor,
while the second is devoted to McGavock Manor, a popular AirBNB rental that has
been featured in Apartment Therapy and Domino.</p>

The conclusion seemed clear and shared by all: the earth is sick. Very sick. And if we continue to pollute as we do, without thinking about the consequences, we will leave our children a planet virtually uninhabitable. Why give us much trouble to access the progress, and continue to write the history of humanity, if it is to destroy nature, that which gives us life, feeds us and protect us? What if interest to work hard to reach with comfort and technology if, at the same time, you set fire to your house?</strong></p><p><i>Nous parlions d'environnement avec des membres de l'association. Le constat semblait clair et partagé par tous : la Terre est malade. Très malade. Et si nous continuons à la polluer comme nous le faisons, sans penser aux conséquences, nous laisserons à nos enfants une planète quasi-invivable. Pourquoi nous donner tant de mal pour accéder au progrès, et continuer d'écrire l'Histoire de l'humanité, si c'est pour détruire la nature, celle qui nous donne la vie, nous nourrit, et nous protège ? Quel intérêt de travailler dur pour accéder au confort et à la technologie si, dans le même temps, vous mettez le feu à votre maison ?​</i></p><p><strong>What is amazing is that, until around us, and despite the immense media coverage of the COP21, very few people know what global warming. Too few people are aware of the disasters that await us.</strong></p><p><i>Ce qui est étonnant, c'est que, jusqu'autour de nous, et malgré l'immense couverture médiatique dont à bénéficié la COP21, très peu de gens savent ce qu'est le réchauffement climatique. Trop peu de gens sont conscients des catastrophes qui nous guettent​</i></p><p><strong>We then had the idea to design a new symbol to endorse the fight against climate change and hold high the banner of the 17 sustainable development goals. Our model? The Olympic torch. No introduction of, and I think she has all our sympathy. Whoever we are, wherever we are, there are high chances may have been heard.  When she passes in a place, she unleashes the crowds. But instead of fire, we chose to consecrate the light...</strong></p><p><i>Nous avons alors eu l'idée de concevoir un nouveau symbole pour incarner la lutte contre le changement climatique et porter haut l'étendard des 17 objectifs de développement durable. Notre modèle ? La torche olympique. On ne la présente plus, et je pense qu'elle a toute notre sympathie. Qui que l'on soit, où que l'on soit, il y a  de grande chances qu'on en ait entendu parler.

It would even be its origin. Some 3 billion years ago there was an innovation that revolutionized life. Some cells developed the capability to transform the solar energy into chemical power, thus creating photosynthesis, which is essential for life on Earth. Thanks to it vegetal species generate oxygen, grow cereals, fruits and vegetables we feed upon and that feed our animals.</strong></p><p><i>La lumière représente la vie depuis toujours. Elle en serait même à l’origine. Il y a environ 3 milliards d’années apparut une innovation qui allait révolutionner la vie. Certaines cellules développèrent la faculté de transformer l’énergie du rayonnement solaire en énergie chimique, créant ainsi la photosynthèse. Cette dernière est essentielle à la vie sur Terre : à travers elle, les espèces végétales nous fournissent de l’oxygène, et produisent les céréales, les fruits et les légumes dont nous nous nourrissons, et avec lesquels nous alimentons nos bêtes.</i></p><p><strong>THANKS TO THOMAS EDISON, THE ELECTRIC BULB, AN EVOLUTION FOR EVERYDAY LIFE ​</strong><i>Grâce à Thomas Edison, l’ampoule électrique révolution de la vie quotidienne</i></p><p><strong>As a major element in comfort and modernity lighting is part of the things that enable the well being in our societies. Until the 19th century, fire was the main source of light, principally using torches or candles. Candles were mostly used because they were easy to use and cheap to buy.</strong></p><p><i>Élément majeur dans le confort et la modernité, l’éclairage fait partie des choses qui assurent le bon fonctionnement de nos sociétés. Jusqu’au 19è siècle, le feu a été la principale source de lumière, notamment par l’utilisation de torches, de chandelles ou de bougies. Les bougies étaient les plus utilisées, pour leur facilité de fonctionnement et leur faible coût qui les rendait accessibles.</i></p><p><strong>On Oct.22 1879, a brilliant engineer invented electric lighting. After numerous attempts, tha American Thomas Edison managed to produce a lasting lighting, he got current through a carbon filament in a vaccum bulb. Its use has drastically changed the everyday life of man. Nowadays electric lighting represents one of the most spread sources of energy in the world.</strong></p><p><i>Le 22 octobre 1879, un ingénieur génial invente l'éclairage électrique. Après d'innombrables essais, l'Américain Thomas Edison réussit à produire un éclairage durable en faisant passer du courant à travers un filament de carbone dans une ampoule sous vide. Son usage a bouleversé la vie quotidienne des individus. De nos jours, l’éclairage électrique représente l’une des sources de lumière les plus répandues au monde.</i></p><p><strong>TOWARD A NEW ENLIGHTENMENT </strong><i>Vers un nouveau Siècle des Lumières ?</i></p><p><strong>The Age of the Enlightenment traditionally took place during the 18th century. The Enlightenment is a European philosiphical and literary movement of the 18th century, based on reason which allows, according to those philosophers,to break the barriers of prejudices and intolerance to lead mankind toward happiness, freedom and knowledge.</strong></p><p><i>Le Siècle des Lumières désigne traditionnellement le 18è siècle. Les Lumières sont un mouvement philosophique et littéraire européen du 18è siècle fondé sur la raison qui permet, selon les philosophes des lumières, de sortir des préjugés et de l’intolérance, et de faire progresser les hommes vers le bonheur, la liberté et le savoir.</i></p><p><strong>Thanks to ‘Light Us’ everybody will be able to get tools to preserve life, to light their path toward a brighter future.</strong></p><p><i>A travers « Light Us », chacun pourra disposer d’outils pour préserver la vie, éclairer son quotidien et illuminer les chemins de l’avenir.</i></p><h3> </h3><h3><strong>TRAVELLING POLLUTION</strong></h3><p><i>LA POLLUTION EN VOYAGE</i></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473084672/bbeqqpaiu1jdvzwmrvcc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><strong>Every year more than 2.5 million Moroccans living abroad come back home to visit their relatives and get some holidays, to go back to their roots and keep in touch with their mother country.</strong></p><p><i>Chaque année, plus de 2,5 millions de marocains résidents hors des frontières du Royaume rentrent au pays pour rendre visite à leurs familles et profiter des vacances pour se ressourcer et maintenir le lien qui unit les marocains du monde à leur patrie.</i></p><p><strong>That mass migration takes place in summer between June and September, essentially by car, as most of the Moroccans living abroad are settled in Western Europe.</strong></p><p><strong>So during the summer 2015 2,474,348 Moroccans living abroad went back to Morocco ; a figure steadily rising (+4.56%) compared to the same period in 2014.

Thank you Google ! Traduit à l'aide de Google. Merci Google ! :p :pHello the world ! Salut la Terre !I am Zach, PR officer, 30 years old. Nice to meet you ! Je suis Zach, Consultant en RP, j'ai 30 ans. Enchanté !I launched a few months ago a think tank with the objective to provide innovative solutions for a sustainable world. As I am Franco-Moroccan, I have an extraordinary opportunity... I have the privilege of hosting two successive COP ! The COP21 was held in Paris ( France ) and the COP22 to be held in November in Marrakech ( Morocco ).J'ai lancé il y a quelques mois un think tant dans le but de proposer des solutions innovantes pour batir un monde durable. Je suis franco-marocain. Comme tous les franco-marocains, j'ai le privilège de recevoir 2 COP successives !! La COP21 a eu lieu à Paris (France) et la COP22 aura lieu à Marrakech (Maroc) en novembre prochain !I would like to take this opportunity to offer you to participate in a project history : I propose to produce a new symbol for sustainable development : the smart torch « Light Us ». Designed and produced by ordinary citizens of the world , she will educate humanity on the issue of global warming that threatens our future.J'aimerais saisir cette opportunité pour vous proposer de participer à un projet historique: je propose de produire un nouveau symbole pour le développement durable : la Torche intelligente ""Light Us"" ! Conçue et produite par d'ordinaires citoyens du monde, elle permettra de sensibiliser l'humanité sur la question de réchauffement climatique qui menace notre avenir.To present this torch, we will forward it from Paris to Marrakech in electric vehicle  during a single event : The Light Us Sustainable Relay. This will allow us to demonstrate that we can design to travel differently , in the interest of all.Pour présenter cette torche, nous l'acheminerons de Paris à Marrakech en véhicule électrique dans le cadre d'un événement unique : Le Relais Durable ""Light us"". Cela démontrera que nous pouvons concevoir de voyager autrement, dans l'intérêt de tous.From the COP22 , the states receiving the COP will pass the torch as in an Olympic relay. If we can defeat global warming, then we are all gold medalists . We have offered a future for our children .À partir de la COP22, les Etats qui recevront la COP se transmettront la torche comme lors d'un relais Olympique. Si nous parvenons à endiguer le réchauffement climatique, alors nous serons tous médaillés d'or !!! Nous aurons offert un avenir à nos enfants. We of course first contacted the organizers of COP21 and COP22 . Nous avons, bien sur, d'abord contacté les organisateurs des COP21 et COP22.We have submitted the project to the scientific committee of the COP22 , which was evaluated positively , and we will send the Official COP22 Label for our side event . We thank the organizing committee of the COP22 and the Minister of Environment of Morocco , Mrs. Hakima El Haite , who testified his support on Facebook !Nous avons soumis le projet au Comité Scientifique de la COP22, qui l'a évalué positivement, et nous enverra dans les jours à venir le Label Officiel de la COP22 pour notre événement !Nous remercions le Comité d'Organisation de la COP22, et la Ministre de l'Environnement du Maroc, Madame  Hakima El Haite, qui nous a témoigné son soutien sur Facebook !We also discuss with private partners , we hope to see many around this event. Of course we will keep you informed of our progress during the campaign. Nous discutons également avec des partenaires privés. Nous espérons les voir nombreux à cet événement. Let's discover below the 17 Sustainable Development Goals. Découvrez ci-dessous les 17 Objecifs de Développement Durable Before getting into the thick of it , I invite you to discover the actors in this great initiative in the photo gallery !Avant d'entrer dans le vif du sujet, je vous invite à découvrir les acteurs de cette belle initiative dans la gallerie photo !WHY WE HAVE LAUNCHED THIS PROJECTPOURQUOI NOUS AVONS LANCÉ​ CE PROJET We were talking about environment with members. The conclusion seemed clear and shared by all: the earth is sick. Very sick. And if we continue to pollute as we do, without thinking about the consequences, we will leave our children a planet virtually uninhabitable. Why give us much trouble to access the progress, and continue to write the history of humanity, if it is to destroy nature, that which gives us life, feeds us and protect us? What if interest to work hard to reach with comfort and technology if, at the same time, you set fire to your house?Nous parlions d'environnement avec des membres de l'association. Le constat semblait clair et partagé par tous : la Terre est malade. Très malade. Et si nous continuons à la polluer comme nous le faisons, sans penser aux conséquences, nous laisserons à nos enfants une planète quasi-invivable. Pourquoi nous donner tant de mal pour accéder au progrès, et continuer d'écrire l'Histoire de l'humanité, si c'est pour détruire la nature, celle qui nous donne la vie, nous nourrit, et nous protège ? Quel intérêt de travailler dur pour accéder au confort et à la technologie si, dans le même temps, vous mettez le feu à votre maison ?​What is amazing is that, until around us, and despite the immense media coverage of the COP21, very few people know what global warming. Too few people are aware of the disasters that await us.Ce qui est étonnant, c'est que, jusqu'autour de nous, et malgré l'immense couverture médiatique dont à bénéficié la COP21, très peu de gens savent ce qu'est le réchauffement climatique. Trop peu de gens sont conscients des catastrophes qui nous guettent​We then had the idea to design a new symbol to endorse the fight against climate change and hold high the banner of the 17 sustainable development goals. Our model? The Olympic torch. No introduction of, and I think she has all our sympathy. Whoever we are, wherever we are, there are high chances may have been heard.  When she passes in a place, she unleashes the crowds. But instead of fire, we chose to consecrate the light...Nous avons alors eu l'idée de concevoir un nouveau symbole pour incarner la lutte contre le changement climatique et porter haut l'étendard des 17 objectifs de développement durable. Notre modèle ? La torche olympique. On ne la présente plus, et je pense qu'elle a toute notre sympathie. Qui que l'on soit, où que l'on soit, il y a  de grande chances qu'on en ait entendu parler. A son passage, elle déchaîne les foules. Sauf qu'à la place du feu, nous voulons consacrer la lumière...THE LIGHT US SUSTAINABLE TORCHLA TORCHE DURABLE ""LIGHT US"" CHARACTERISTICS OF THE LIGHT US TORCH:CARACTERISTIQUES DE LA TORCHE LIGHT US:
Luminous and photovoltaic, it lights and reloads thanks to sunrays. Lumineuse et photovoltaïque : elle produira de la lumière et se rechargera grâce aux rayons du soleil

Ecological and biodegradable, it is manufactured with 100% biodegradable materials to promote a ‘clean product’. Ecologique et Biodégradable : elle sera façonnée dans des matériaux 100% biodégradables pour promouvoir le « produire propre ».


Smart and connected, to favor interaction between the torch and the public. Intelligente et connectée : pour permettre la création d’interactions entre la torche et le public.

 THE SYMBOLISM OF LIGHT :LA SYMBOLIQUE DE LA LUMIÈRE LIGHT : SOURCE OF LIFE  La lumière aux origines de la vie. The light has always represented life. It would even be its origin. Some 3 billion years ago there was an innovation that revolutionized life. Some cells developed the capability to transform the solar energy into chemical power, thus creating photosynthesis, which is essential for life on Earth. Thanks to it vegetal species generate oxygen, grow cereals, fruits and vegetables we feed upon and that feed our animals.La lumière représente la vie depuis toujours. Elle en serait même à l’origine. Il y a environ 3 milliards d’années apparut une innovation qui allait révolutionner la vie. Certaines cellules développèrent la faculté de transformer l’énergie du rayonnement solaire en énergie chimique, créant ainsi la photosynthèse. Cette dernière est essentielle à la vie sur Terre : à travers elle, les espèces végétales nous fournissent de l’oxygène, et produisent les céréales, les fruits et les légumes dont nous nous nourrissons, et avec lesquels nous alimentons nos bêtes.THANKS TO THOMAS EDISON, THE ELECTRIC BULB, AN EVOLUTION FOR EVERYDAY LIFE ​Grâce à Thomas Edison, l’ampoule électrique révolution de la vie quotidienneAs a major element in comfort and modernity lighting is part of the things that enable the well being in our societies. Until the 19th century, fire was the main source of light, principally using torches or candles. Candles were mostly used because they were easy to use and cheap to buy.Élément majeur dans le confort et la modernité, l’éclairage fait partie des choses qui assurent le bon fonctionnement de nos sociétés. Jusqu’au 19è siècle, le feu a été la principale source de lumière, notamment par l’utilisation de torches, de chandelles ou de bougies. Les bougies étaient les plus utilisées, pour leur facilité de fonctionnement et leur faible coût qui les rendait accessibles.On Oct.22 1879, a brilliant engineer invented electric lighting. After numerous attempts, tha American Thomas Edison managed to produce a lasting lighting, he got current through a carbon filament in a vaccum bulb. Its use has drastically changed the everyday life of man. Nowadays electric lighting represents one of the most spread sources of energy in the world.Le 22 octobre 1879, un ingénieur génial invente l'éclairage électrique. Après d'innombrables essais, l'Américain Thomas Edison réussit à produire un éclairage durable en faisant passer du courant à travers un filament de carbone dans une ampoule sous vide. Son usage a bouleversé la vie quotidienne des individus. De nos jours, l’éclairage électrique représente l’une des sources de lumière les plus répandues au monde.TOWARD A NEW ENLIGHTENMENT Vers un nouveau Siècle des Lumières ?The Age of the Enlightenment traditionally took place during the 18th century. The Enlightenment is a European philosiphical and literary movement of the 18th century, based on reason which allows, according to those philosophers,to break the barriers of prejudices and intolerance to lead mankind toward happiness, freedom and knowledge.Le Siècle des Lumières désigne traditionnellement le 18è siècle. Les Lumières sont un mouvement philosophique et littéraire européen du 18è siècle fondé sur la raison qui permet, selon les philosophes des lumières, de sortir des préjugés et de l’intolérance, et de faire progresser les hommes vers le bonheur, la liberté et le savoir.Thanks to ‘Light Us’ everybody will be able to get tools to preserve life, to light their path toward a brighter future.A travers « Light Us », chacun pourra disposer d’outils pour préserver la vie, éclairer son quotidien et illuminer les chemins de l’avenir. TRAVELLING POLLUTIONLA POLLUTION EN VOYAGEEvery year more than 2.5 million Moroccans living abroad come back home to visit their relatives and get some holidays, to go back to their roots and keep in touch with their mother country.Chaque année, plus de 2,5 millions de marocains résidents hors des frontières du Royaume rentrent au pays pour rendre visite à leurs familles et profiter des vacances pour se ressourcer et maintenir le lien qui unit les marocains du monde à leur patrie.That mass migration takes place in summer between June and September, essentially by car, as most of the Moroccans living abroad are settled in Western Europe.So during the summer 2015 2,474,348 Moroccans living abroad went back to Morocco ; a figure steadily rising (+4.56%) compared to the same period in 2014. (cf Department in charge of Moroccans living abroad and migration).Cette migration massive, qui a lieu lors des mois d’été, entre juin et septembre, se fait essentiellement par la route, l’immense majorité des marocains du monde habitant l’Europe de l’ouest.Ainsi, au cours de l’été 2015, 2.474.348 Marocains résidant à l'étranger (MRE) ont regagné le Maroc, un chiffre en une hausse de 4,56 % par rapport à la même période de l'année précédente (cf. ministère chargé des Marocains résidant à l'étranger et des Affaires de la migration).These transits are made easier by the Fundation Mohammed V for Solidarity under the patronage of His Majesty King Mohammed VI and by the ‘Operation Marhaba’, whose objective is to welcome during summer Moroccans living abroad. The 2015 edition was a real success especially thanks to the constant cooperation between the Moroccan and Spanish authorities and thank to the implication of many partners (private companies, associations,…)Ces transits sont facilités par la mise en place par la Fondation Mohammed V pour la Solidarité, et sous le Haut Patronage de Sa Majesté le Roi Mohamed VI, de « l’Opération Marhaba », dont l’objectif est de faciliter l'accueil des Marocains résidant à l'étranger (MRE) au cours des périodes estivales.L’édition 2015 a connu un grand succès, notamment grâce à la coordination permanente entre les autorités marocaines et espagnoles et à l’implication de nombreux intervenants (entreprises privées, associations etc.).According to the figures we have the road through Spain is still the most important European way for Moroccan travelers. The massive summer migration of Moroccans from Europe may be a cause of pollution and increase the CO2 greenhouse gas emissions in that era of the world at a period when the temperatures are higher. We also have to add the incivilities travelers may be responsible for on the road (garbage, damage,…). Those behaviors are of course common to every nation, they are not specific to Moroccans.Au regard des chiffres dont nous disposons, l’accès par l’Espagne constitue donc le plus important dans l’itinéraire européen des voyageurs marocains.La migration estivale massive des marocains d’Europe peut constituer un vecteur de pollution et une source d’accroissement de l’émission des gaz à effet de serre non négligeable dans cette région du monde, au moment de l’année où les températures y sont les plus élevées. A cela s’ajoutent les incivilités dont peuvent se monter coupables ceux qui voyagent par la route (déchets, dégradations etc.). Ces comportements sont bien entendu inhérents à tous les peuples, et ne se limitent pas seulement aux voyageurs marocains.EVENT : THE LIGHT US SUSTAINABLE RELAY​ÉVÉNEMENT : LE RELAIS DURABLE ""LIGHT US""So we're going from Paris , and repeat the route we take from childhood to go to Morocco , but this time in the electric vehicle, proudly wearing the new symbol of the fight against global warming : Torch Light Us !Nous partirons donc de Paris, et prendrons la route comme nous le faisons depuis notre plus tendre enfance pour rejoindre le Maroc. Mais cette fois-ci, nous le ferons en véhicule électrique, portant fièrement le nouveau Symbole de la lutte contre le Changement Climatique : La Torche ""Light us"" !The trip will be broadcast live and uninterrupted on the internet, and all the chains that agree to disseminate us. Animations will enhance the trip, during which we expect three shows : in Paris, in Madrid and Marrakech.Le voyage sera diffusé en direct et sans interruption sur internet, et sur toutes les chaînes qui accepteraient de nous diffuser. Des animations viendront agrémenter le voyage, durant lequel nous avons prévu d'organiser trois grands spectacles : à Paris pour le départ, à Madrid, et à l'arrivée à Marrakech. THE LIGHT US WEB PLATFORMA web platform dedicated to the Light Us Project would be created. It would be composed of a web site and of an application that would allow :Une plateforme web dédiée au projet Light Us verrait le jour. Elle serait composée d’un site internet et d’une application qui permettraient :

To get multilingual information for citizens about sustainable development. D’informer, dans plusieurs langues, les citoyens sur les questions de développement durable

</p><p><b>Are
you passionate about fashion?</b></p>
<p>So are we. And that is why we want
to connect fashion fans and fashion designers worldwide. At Guedias.com, we aim
to build an online platform were the best designers and manufacturers can
showcase their products to buyers and fans around the world. We seek to promote
only quality creations that are original.</p>
<p>Our dream is to be unlike any other
shop you’ve ever seen: what you’ll see at Guedias, you won’t find anywhere
else.</p>
<p><b>For
fashion lovers: all in one place</b></p>
<p>At Guedias, we’ve always admired
luxury shops that offer a wide range of goods and brands all in one place. So
we thought “how great would it be to create a recognized launchpad that could
give up-and-coming manufacturers throughout the world the same chance?”</p>
<p>However, more than luxury, the
Guedias culture is based on high-end originality, authenticity, topnotch
innovation and honesty. We want the buyers to have an unforgettable experience
each time they come by, with fresh and surprising discoveries every time. </p>
<p><b>For
designers: an amazing opportunity</b></p>
<p>But, most of all, we want to give an
opportunity to budding designers to show their point of view. We believe
talents should be nourished by audiences, not locked in nine-to-five jobs
somewhere.</p>
<p>Culture can have a big influence on
a designer’s aesthetic. And that is why we want to recruit all over the world -
and not just in a few countries! We’re looking for truly 100% original, 100%
unique, 100% exclusive creations.</p>
<p>Additionally, we know it can be hard
for designers coming from less fortunate countries to have their voices heard.
And, more than anything, we want to tackle that. We want to give an opportunity
to everyone’s talent, regardless of their nationality, country of origin,
sexual orientation, gender identification, ethnicity or race.</p>
<p>We hope Guedias.com will establish
itself has a launchpad for all those who share our dream of growing in fashion.</p>
<p><b>How
can you be sure of the quality?</b></p>
<p>Because we want to assure that each
product sold through Guedias.com has the highest quality standards, we make
sure each of our vendors can guarantee good raw materials, exceptional
manufacturing and careful attention to every detail.</p>
<p>When we first created our
partnership with our first vendor, <i>Le
Beau Paysan</i>, we verified if the factories could build true leather goods
that would pass the test of time. Then, we worked closely with the product
designers to understand the whole process and how leather can be suitable for
an iPhone case and, in fact, complement the high-end design that characterizes
Apple.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1458449607/vzinnqhqtaihgng0sazi.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>
</p><p><b>Why
do we need the money?</b></p>
<p>To expand our platform, we have to
invest our own time in finding new vendors and creative minds. If you want to
help us by promoting our platform, you will be welcomed. </p>

<br/></div>","Are
you passionate about fashion?
So are we. And that is why we want
to connect fashion fans and fashion designers worldwide. At Guedias.com, we aim
to build an online platform were the best designers and manufacturers can
showcase their products to buyers and fans around the world. We seek to promote
only quality creations that are original.
Our dream is to be unlike any other
shop you’ve ever seen: what you’ll see at Guedias, you won’t find anywhere
else.
For
fashion lovers: all in one place
At Guedias, we’ve always admired
luxury shops that offer a wide range of goods and brands all in one place. So
we thought “how great would it be to create a recognized launchpad that could
give up-and-coming manufacturers throughout the world the same chance?”
However, more than luxury, the
Guedias culture is based on high-end originality, authenticity, topnotch
innovation and honesty. We want the buyers to have an unforgettable experience
each time they come by, with fresh and surprising discoveries every time. 
For
designers: an amazing opportunity
But, most of all, we want to give an
opportunity to budding designers to show their point of view. We believe
talents should be nourished by audiences, not locked in nine-to-five jobs
somewhere.
Culture can have a big influence on
a designer’s aesthetic. And that is why we want to recruit all over the world -
and not just in a few countries! We’re looking for truly 100% original, 100%
unique, 100% exclusive creations.
Additionally, we know it can be hard
for designers coming from less fortunate countries to have their voices heard.
And, more than anything, we want to tackle that. We want to give an opportunity
to everyone’s talent, regardless of their nationality, country of origin,
sexual orientation, gender identification, ethnicity or race.
We hope Guedias.com will establish
itself has a launchpad for all those who share our dream of growing in fashion.
How
can you be sure of the quality?
Because we want to assure that each
product sold through Guedias.com has the highest quality standards, we make
sure each of our vendors can guarantee good raw materials, exceptional
manufacturing and careful attention to every detail.
When we first created our
partnership with our first vendor, Le
Beau Paysan, we verified if the factories could build true leather goods
that would pass the test of time. Then, we worked closely with the product
designers to understand the whole process and how leather can be suitable for
an iPhone case and, in fact, complement the high-end design that characterizes
Apple.

Why
do we need the money?
To expand our platform, we have to
invest our own time in finding new vendors and creative minds. If you want to
help us by promoting our platform, you will be welcomed. 
However, if you can, help us improve
our platform by funding this project. We want to take every possible step to
assure the platform will function without considerable downtimes and without a
huge load time for those of us living in the most remote places. We also intend
to purchase the most efficient software to assure the security of our payments

<p>When does a garment turn from a simple thing into a sentimental object? When do we begin to love what we wear? Each of us has a favorite garment, in most cases even this is a T-shirt Usually the favorite garment is the one that looks well on us, brings a memory created by carrying it or has its own history and may be a symbol of something or someone valuable to us, perhaps even helps us to express ourselves. It's good when the garment influences, when it's not just stuff when it has a meaning. That was how the idea of Roilly was born - a cause, a message, an emotion in a T-shirt.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Who are we? </strong></p>
<p>Our team consists of two people - Robert and Iliyana, hence the name of the brand. We define ourselves as young entrepreneurs, ambassadors of children's art, sometimes dreamers, but rather a team with a cause, willing to put our energy into the garment we wear and make you smile by wearing it.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Our</strong><strong> idea and how </strong><strong>it </strong><strong>was born</strong><strong>:</strong></p>
<p>Our idea is to create T-shirts with children's drawings. Not just any drawings, but those containing the children inside us (we believe that it is not lost :)), drawings that have a message, that set a good mood, that add color to our gray everyday life, drawings creating emotion. The Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-Exupery drew a snake that swallowed an elefant that was visible to adults only as hat. It is a great example of the simple beauty of the children‘s art.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Who is involved in the process? </strong></p>
<p>Of course the children, little artists who are willing to show their work to anyone. Our involvement is in the selection and distribution of the provided drawings. At this stage, we do not own the copyrights of these works. All rights belong to the legal owner. The use of these works is not intended to commit an intellectual property offense.</p>
<p>At a later stage, we have the desire to organize prize competitions for children's drawings so that we can offer a wider catalog of drawing choices. We will provide brief information for each drawing, including the age and name of the little artist, a description of the painting or the message it carries. We believe that when we know what it means and we can express that meaning through the art of the youngest, we build an emotional connection.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Why are we doing this?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Getting the children's art out of the </strong><strong>drawing sheets.</strong></p>
<p>We believe that children draw pictures with meaning, recreate the way they perceive the world and that deserves attention and appreciation. We believe that the endless mind of a child can create drawings capable of reaching your soul..</p>

<p><strong>What is the contribution to society - social responsibility?</strong></p>
<p>We want to engage the society towards the young ones.  We want to give everyone the opportunity to appreciate how children draw dreams, thoughts, memories, and the surrounding environment. Provide the opportunity for society to see the world through the pure eyes of a child, a world recreated through the child consciousness and imagination.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Starting point, where are we now and where do we want to go? </strong></p>
<p>At this stage, we start with children's drawings printed on white T-shirts, and later on we intend to add other colors of T-shirts. The print is digital with high quality, eco-friendly paint. The print is resistant to washing, stretching and it does not crack. In this way, we achieve the durability of colors in long-term wear and washing. We have different fits for each gender and variety of sizes. The fabric is made of 100% high quality cotton to make our T-shirt comfortable and soft.</p>

<h3>My Past is Like a Nightmare</h3>
<p>Written by:  Sabina Tamang</p>
<p>It is upsetting whenever I think about my past. The kind of life I lived in Mumbai brothel and the kind of work I had to do, was a nightmare.... In 1996, when the Indian Police raided the brothels in Mumbai, I was among one of them to be rescued... But, then I think again I was lucky to get a second chance. Many of my friends died in the same hell. These days I am extremely busy and happy. I want to be an artist in the future, but only the future will tell if I will be successful in fulfilling my dream. </p>

It is upsetting whenever I think about my past. The kind of life I lived in Mumbai brothel and the kind of work I had to do, was a nightmare.... In 1996, when the Indian Police raided the brothels in Mumbai, I was among one of them to be rescued... But, then I think again I was lucky to get a second chance. Many of my friends died in the same hell. These days I am extremely busy and happy. I want to be an artist in the future, but only the future will tell if I will be successful in fulfilling my dream.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p></p>
<h4>What is the difference between the two movements?</h4>
<b>A quartz movement</b> is the most abundant type of watch movement you see today. They are electronic devices that <b>use battery</b> current to pulse a quartz crystal, measuring its vibration and calculating time based on that. A combination of extremely low cost and high stability makes it a common choice for other high-quality watch manufacturers.<br/><p><b>An automatic movement</b> is a mechanical watch movement with a<b> self-winding</b> device. Mechanical watch movements pre-date quartz movements, and are the old, traditional way of watchmaking. They are entirely gear-driven devices that are powered by the tension of a wound spring. The expression ""wind a watch"" comes from these designs. The key improvement of an Automatic is that if you wear the watch regularly, you seldom ever need to wind it. A weighted rotor in the back is designed to swing with your body movement and wind it for you. The other benefit is that mechanical watches have heirloom potential, when periodically serviced, a mechanical movement can potentially last many generations longer than quartz. This is why you see 100 year old pocket watches that still tick.<br/></p>
<p><b>We use Swiss made ""Ronda 713"" movement:</b><br/><b>Type:</b> Electronic quartz movement<br/><b>Description:</b> A high quality Swiss made electronic movement with five jewel seatings. Uses a 371 style battery.<br/><b>Reason to choose:</b> The excellent value and low cost of a quartz movement cannot be beat. Though there is the undeniable charm of owning a mechanical watch, with quartz you get dependable timekeeping, a low hassle experience, and a level of quality synonymous with Swiss Made.<br/><b>Specifications: </b></p>
<ul>
<li>60 month battery life</li>
<li>Serviceable design</li>
<li>5 jewels</li>

Aegaon delivered all the watches of the previous campaign and shall do it this time as well.</p></div>","OUR STORY, THAT JUST KEEPS ON GETTING BETTER The man who gave the world rock n roll, gave us the idea for AEGAON. Just a mear glimpse at Elvis's huge wrist watch in the video ""Always On My Mind"", was enough to spark the idea. That was in 2012. Two years later, the ""Peacemaker 65"" was released. It became a success on Indiegogo. Estonian media was impressed, for it was also the first watch made in Estonia, ever. More than 75 000 followers on Aegaon Watches Facebook page. We had done something right. Now, a year later, we are honored to be back on Indiegogo with our great new  design – ""Tabula Rasa"".""AEGA ON"" is what we say for ""take your time""...

We
come from a small European country named Estonia – the home of Skype,
TransfereWise, Ewert And The Two Dragons, the great sumo wrestler Baruto Kaido
Höövelson along with other great names. Estonia is known for combining innovation with high technology
and that´s just what we have done with AEGAON.

SECOND DESIGN ""TABULA RASA""
The design is named after a classical music composition “Tabula Rasa” by Estonia’s world famous composer Mr. Arvo Pärt, who celebrated his 80th birthday this year. ""Tabula Rasa""  is a Latin phrase often translated as ""blank slate"" or the idea, that individuals are born without built-in mental content and therefore all knowledge comes from experience or perception. A perfect match for our watch.




Tabula Rasa automatic black with black bracelet

Tabula Rasa stainless steel quartz with brown leather strap

We designed it to be comfortable to wear by placing the crown under an angle. Be modern with an electronic quartz movement or go old school with a mechanical automatic movement, that winds itself as you wear it on your wrist. Make your choice between a black and stainless steel casing, quartz or mechanical movement.



Specifications


Case Dimensions: 44MM x 10.5MM

Case Material: 316L brushed stainless steel

Optics: sapphire crystal 

Water Resistant: 328 feet / 100 meters (10 ATM)

Strap: black or brown genuine leather band / black or stainless steel braceletP.S Please note that we will personally verify your choice of strap right after the campaign!


Choice of movements:

 Swiss ""Ronda 713"" electronic quartz
 Japan ""Miyota 9015"" mechanical automatic
 Warranty: 2 years




TWO DESIGNS & TWO MOVEMENTS

Be modern with an electronic quartz movement, that runs on battery or go old school with a self-winding, mechanical automatic movement. Both are available for each design.




What is the difference between the two movements?
A quartz movement is the most abundant type of watch movement you see today. They are electronic devices that use battery current to pulse a quartz crystal, measuring its vibration and calculating time based on that. A combination of extremely low cost and high stability makes it a common choice for other high-quality watch manufacturers.An automatic movement is a mechanical watch movement with a self-winding device. Mechanical watch movements pre-date quartz movements, and are the old, traditional way of watchmaking. They are entirely gear-driven devices that are powered by the tension of a wound spring. The expression ""wind a watch"" comes from these designs. The key improvement of an Automatic is that if you wear the watch regularly, you seldom ever need to wind it. A weighted rotor in the back is designed to swing with your body movement and wind it for you. The other benefit is that mechanical watches have heirloom potential, when periodically serviced, a mechanical movement can potentially last many generations longer than quartz. This is why you see 100 year old pocket watches that still tick.
We use Swiss made ""Ronda 713"" movement:Type: Electronic quartz movementDescription: A high quality Swiss made electronic movement with five jewel seatings. Uses a 371 style battery.Reason to choose: The excellent value and low cost of a quartz movement cannot be beat. Though there is the undeniable charm of owning a mechanical watch, with quartz you get dependable timekeeping, a low hassle experience, and a level of quality synonymous with Swiss Made.Specifications:

<h3>The Lowdown.</h3>
<p>We’ve put careful consideration into the leather selected to create the Gear S bracelet. We
thought that <b>Gear S users don't need ""another plastic thing""</b> on their wrist. </p>
<p>We wanted to make our bracelets to be as 'hand-friendly' as possible. That's why plastic
and silicon were out of the question (<i>even though we’ve made several samples
out of these materials</i>). Eventually we’ve reached the leather. Being a <b>beautiful,
strong and durable material</b> it feels really natural when touches the skin. </p>

</div></div>","Samsung Gear S Wrist Fashion Due date there is a vast majority of smartwatches, but just a few of them can get the job done. Samsung Gear S is one of those wearables that can replace your smartphone and save your pocket space, which is consumed by large smartphones and your everyday carry essentials.
As you know, there is always a fly in the ointment, Gear S wasn't an exception. creating an outstanding gadget Samsung for some reason gave it a strap that can definitely spoil the feel of this tech.
As an owner of this smartwatch I also faced this problem and decided to fix it.
Here's what we have for you guys, we've designed and created leather straps that would be an ideal fit for your Gear S smartwatch.


As you know the fitting of the smartwatch is really out of this world (not in a good sense), that's why we had to wrack our heads over this. 
In spite of everything we've made Gear S sit tightly inside the leather strap, the same way it rests in the standard silicone strap.

So, Silicone or Leather?
All materials have their own pluses and minuses, we'd like to show you the benefits of a leather strap comparing to the standard one.





SILICONE


LEATHER






Silicone looks quite shabby after long wear.





Shabby leather looks even more sexy (ask any girl, she will prove it).







In summer your hand feels really sweaty under silicone strap.





Leather inevitably absorbs your skin oils and sweat, still your hand feels well under leather strap.







Silicone is an artificial material, not recommended for allergic
  people.





Natural material, best for allergic people.







Best for sports and outdoor activities, is not a good option for your white shirt.





Fits casual, dress and outdoor wear, definitely a good accent for your shirt, and jacket.







Cold air hardens silicone.





Cold air does not affect natural leather at all.







Can be cleaned easily, but the scratches still remain.





If soiled leather strap can be cleaned with soap, and covered with castor oil.





As you can see leather strap really ""pulls off the winner's blanket"", and becomes a big plus to your style.


So What We've Got Here for You?
 Depending on your taste, you can choose among several leather colors, even though black is preferable we can make it look the way you want it:


choose among six basic colors: black, white, dark/light brown, olive and red.

Depending on your style and accessories you wear, we can add number of dingles to your strap, those include:



buckles;

buttons;
spikes;
rivets;
etc.



What We Need & What You Get?
We've invested time, money and efforts to design Gear S bracelet concepts. We've made friends with leather experts who helped us develop bracelet with the best specifications that are needed to keep your Gear S safe on your wrist.

Please note! The cradle snaps easily to the Gear S hosted within leather bracelet.



Now we are ready to
manufacture and deliver the Gear S leather bracelets and we need your
help to raise the funds needed for the following steps:


We've selected premium quality cow skin, that would look really awesome on your wrist.

We need to purchase tens of square meters of leather, thousands items of accessories, supplies (including thread, needs) and package materials.
We need to cover the costs of production of the bracelets.

NB! By backing our campaign you are guaranteed to get the strap you opt for.

Don't forget to measure your wrist, we need to know if it's too big or too small. If you have an average sized wrist the strap for sure will be a perfect fit for you.

The Lowdown.
We’ve put careful consideration into the leather selected to create the Gear S bracelet. We
thought that Gear S users don't need ""another plastic thing"" on their wrist. 
We wanted to make our bracelets to be as 'hand-friendly' as possible. That's why plastic
and silicon were out of the question (even though we’ve made several samples
out of these materials). Eventually we’ve reached the leather. Being a beautiful,
strong and durable material it feels really natural when touches the skin. 

If you care about your wrist than choosing leather when wearing the Gear
S is the best possible decision.



Other Ways You Can Help. Probably there is a number of reasons why you can't help us and back our campaign. Either you're wearing some other smartwatch, or there is something you don't like. 
Anyways you can help! 
Social media sharing matters a lot, probably one of your friends is a Gear S owner who's looking for some cool leather bracelet.




Please share our campaign on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Instagram,
tumblr or any other social network you're using.


Forward the link and
the information by email to your friends and acquaintance and ask them to do
the same.

Tell us about blogs or
other media channels that could be interested in writing or talking about the Gear
S leather bracelet. We’ll be happy to reach out and provide them with everything they
need to spread the word.

P.S. In case you own some other Gear smartwatch or Pebble Steel (or any other) and you like what you see here, contact us cause we'll definitely be able to serve you.",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Bienvenidos a Qul 3D Printing!</h3> <p>La primera comunidad de 3D Printing en Colombia. Este es un espacio para diseñar y construir lo pensado e inimaginable, un espacio para aprender, para innovar y para revolucionar el mundo. Solo imaginen lo que es posible.</p>
<p>Nuestro sueño es llevar esta increíble tecnología a todos los rincones de Colombia, a los niños, adultos y profesionales para que transformen su pensamiento y educación de lo que es posible y contribuir con el futuro de nuestro país y nuestra sociedad.</p>
<p>Nuestro propósito si llegamos a Cumplir la meta de los $6.500 USD, es adquirir un kit de impresora y scanner ""portable"" algo un poco más pequeño de lo que tenemos, para realizar demostraciones y dar a conocer más esta nueva y magnífica tecnología. Nuestra idea es llegar  a escuelas públicas de municipios cercanos a Bogotá, lugares cercanos a universidades entre otros y hacer talleres de innovación utilizando la tecnología del 3D printing. Para lograr esto, tenemos en mente una impresora que nos permite imprimir en dos materiales (PLA - ABS)  también nos permite imprimir en dos colores simultáneamente. Creemos que es un buen punto de partida. Actualmente existen impresoras muy sofisticadas que pueden llegar a imprimir prótesis de muy alta calidad a unos costos súper bajos (ESTA ES LA META MAS ADELANTE). Es increíble que hoy existan impresoras que imprimen comida, oro, plata, cerámica y hasta células humanas. Por ahora empezaremos con las de PLA.</p>
<p>Creemos de corazón que es un proyecto que puede llegar a jugar un papel importante en nuestro País, pues esto permitirá mucha innovación y muchos caminos por explorar especialmente con todos los niños cuya creatividad es <b><i>infinita.</i></b></p>
<p>Para lograr nuestra meta hemos creado 5 recompensas diferentes por cada donación. Estas son las recompensas:</p> <ul> <li>
<b>$10: Gracias! </b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Como todo en la vida, un paso a la vez se llega a lugares inimaginables. Recibirás una carta digital personalizada con mucho cariño y dedicación. Gracias por tu granito de arena. </span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul> <li>
<b>$25: TuNombre Por Siempre 3D</b> - Tu nombre quedará por siempre en los libros de Qul 3D Printing. Recibirás tu nombre impreso en 5 x 5 cm con una tarjeta personalizada que tendrá la información técnica de tu impresión. Paso a paso llegaremos a la meta...</li>
</ul>
<ul> <li>
<b>$50: Con Paso de Elefante - </b>Como un elefante con determinación y fuerza llegaremos lejos. Recibirás un elefante articulable inspirado en su fuerza y potencial. Gracias por estos pasos de gigante.</li> </ul>
<div>
<ul><li>
<b>$100: Atlas Sosteniendo el Mundo - </b>Atlas no puede sostener el mundo pero tal vez tu celular si :) Con esta inmensurable fuerza seguro lo lograremos. Recibirás un increíble porta celulares para que utilices en tu casa u oficina.</li></ul>
<div>
<ul><li>
<b>$250: Casi vemos la luz! - </b>Podemos ver la luz al final del túnel. Gracias por tu magnífica ayuda. Recibirás una pequeña lámpara  con diseño muy especial.</li></ul>

</div>
<p>Cualquiera que sea la donación que escojas te lo agradecemos de corazón y creénos que nos servirá mucho. Esperamos te gusten las recompensas!</p>
<p>Queremos compartir un caso de éxito y lo que podemos lograr con esta magnífica tecnología. Estuvimos con un Ing. Mecatrónico a quien conocerán en el video, es un increíble proyecto. Él diseño un brazo inteligente para ayudar a personas con problemas de parálisis facial. Hubiese sido muy difícil lograrlo puesto que hacerlo tenía un costo muy elevado. Sin embargo con nuestra ayuda su proyecto se convirtió en realidad y con seguridad podrá llegar a cambiar la vida de muchas personas. Podrás tener más información sobre este proyecto en el video.</p>
<p>Esperamos seguir adelante con este increíble proyecto con tu ayuda. Una gran forma de ayudarnos es difundiendo nuestro mensaje con todas las personas que puedas.</p>

<h1>The Inspiration</h1>
<p>We love our dogs. Years of walking them and being frustrated by the available leash options inspired us to invent something new. Our challenge was to find the right combination of design and materials to provide a versatile, simple, non-mechanical leash, which lets you and your dog enjoy a hands-free walk together - where you manage your dog not the leash!</p>

<p>I am Mark Noonan, inventor, lover of physics and all around professional. My job is to make everyday life simpler but creating simple, intuitive and functional products.

<p>Before launching Nootools, I designed and developed products for some of the world’s leading companies - with many US and international awards and recognitions (including Time Magazine's Best Inventions for our Snow Wolf).

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>While the fabrics and hardware component suppliers have already been sourced, there is always some possibility that once we deliver the final engineering designs for the injection molding, the company doing our tool building may have slightly longer backlogs and lead times which could delay our production.

</div></div>","The story of two friends with one idea We are a team of young italian yacht enthusiasts with a common dream: design the most ecologic boats ever, with an uncompromised design. And, of course, be the very firsts starting up a yacht design studio with a crowdfounding operation.






Dharma Yachts is the direct consequence of a strong friendship born on Instagram over one year ago, when the founder, Jacopo, and Fedor, the co-founder, began sharing their passion for yachting.
We started working everyday, imagine the most ecologic super yacht ever. As the team grew up, we designed ONE, a 30 meters long motor concept-yacht, but she was still really far from our vision. 



We focussed on a smaller boat and we managed to design this boat all around eco-friendly technologies. Other yacht brands offer hybrid yachts of course, but they are generally just a version in the range. Instead, we wanted our boat to be standardly ecologic: we designed a boat all around the best green technologies available nowadays, and not viceversa, creating a boat then trying to fill her with ecologic stuff. 
That's why we created Dharma 99.



Dharma 99 is a 9.9 meters motor daycruiser made with strong and sporty lines and designed to be made at least 30% of recycled materials.

Dharma 99 is designed for those who want to experience the sea or the lake for a one day or a weekend-long trip, to escape the city and to relax with friends or family. 
Dharma 99 is available in two versions: a four-bedded and a single bedroom one. All the interiors are made with the best recycled woods and composite materials, not only to reduce weight but also to reduce the impact on environment. Moving the kitchen outside, hidding it in a locker just behind the passenger seat allowed us to improve the usability of the space under the deck. The bathroom is just under the driver's helm and it's really confortable.
Dharma 99 is also incredibly low fuel consumption, due to two gasoline Volvo Penta D6 330 engines and to the special shape of her hull. Maximum speed is around 38 Kts (extimated). 







In Italy there are famous and expert shipyards: that's the reason why Dharma 99 will be built in the Belpaese - a nice way to call our country - and delivered worldwide, with a very competitive launch price: from 239,000 Euros  + VAT, depending on the shipyard.




We have a very important chance now
 This May, we are officially invited to Capri Island, Italy, for the world première of Dharma 99 during the famous Rolex Sailing Week.




But we need also your help to make it real.
We planned to spend around 20,000 Euros to start-up and set our world première in Capri, but every little help makes the difference.

And if we don't reach our goal, we will still keep our dream alive by using the money for further initiatives and events.
We are everybody under 30, our journey has just begun!







What's next?

We are quite optimistic. We really believe in our project and this is basically the reason why we planned our steps as following, if we overtake our primary 20k Euro goal:



35.000 Euro: massive communication. In case we reach this important goal, we'd invest this extra money for a strong brand communication, to find our first customer. Communication is the key for a successful selling.


50.000 Euro: hybrid version of Dharma 99. With this huge amount of extra money, our team will be finally able to achieve an important goal we decided for our company: make our first full-hybrid yacht.

<h3>How it Started</h3>
<p>It all started when a guy name, Nuzli Hakiim realized that cigar accessories are getting boring. The ones that look amazing and unique, will cost thousands. So he decides that he will design his own cigar accessories. Being a designer and photographer, Nuzli had experience working in the fashion industry and was highly influenced by designers like Alexander McQueen, Emilio Pucci and so on.</p>
<p>After tons of prototypes and designs, he decided to release 3 designs, Draekon(the dragon), Shinikami(the god of death), and lastly a collab with a cigar company called Jas Sum Kral(the smoking lion). </p>
<p>The stands were carefully designed and were made sure that they are small enough to fit in any bags and also heavy enough so that they won't fly off by strong winds. The top curve, the rest, was carefully designed so it fits any ring gauge of cigars.</p>
<p><strong>From a sketch to 3d design to 3d printed to actual prototype</strong></p>

<p>Greatly inspired by Alexander McQueen and Thomassabo, the stand is made of a skull being ripped apart, hence Shinikami or shinigami(死神, “god of death” or “death spirit”) are gods or supernatural spirits that invite humans toward death and can be seen to be present or interpreted to be present in certain aspects of Japanese religion and culture.

<p>Jas Sum Kral or JSK or 'I am King' in Macedonian, is a cigar company that blends amazing cigars. They are the first cigar label that Nuzli has designed. He also ended up designing an illustration of a smoking lion for their brand's t-shirt. And that inspired him to do a collaboration with JSK and designed a smoking lion cigar stand. </p>

</div></div>","How it Started
It all started when a guy name, Nuzli Hakiim realized that cigar accessories are getting boring. The ones that look amazing and unique, will cost thousands. So he decides that he will design his own cigar accessories. Being a designer and photographer, Nuzli had experience working in the fashion industry and was highly influenced by designers like Alexander McQueen, Emilio Pucci and so on.
After tons of prototypes and designs, he decided to release 3 designs, Draekon(the dragon), Shinikami(the god of death), and lastly a collab with a cigar company called Jas Sum Kral(the smoking lion). 
The stands were carefully designed and were made sure that they are small enough to fit in any bags and also heavy enough so that they won't fly off by strong winds. The top curve, the rest, was carefully designed so it fits any ring gauge of cigars.
From a sketch to 3d design to 3d printed to actual prototype

Shinikami Cigar Stand | 1000pcs only

Greatly inspired by Alexander McQueen and Thomassabo, the stand is made of a skull being ripped apart, hence Shinikami or shinigami(死神, “god of death” or “death spirit”) are gods or supernatural spirits that invite humans toward death and can be seen to be present or interpreted to be present in certain aspects of Japanese religion and culture. Yes the hands are shinigami and not the skull.

Jas Sum Kral or JSK or 'I am King' in Macedonian, is a cigar company that blends amazing cigars. They are the first cigar label that Nuzli has designed.

Today, women are finally making real gains in leadership roles, and we have so much to offer with a more creative, inspired approach each day to our work – including how we dress.</p><p>An Alice Riot dress, skirt or scarf is a limited-edition print and a wise investment that brings that creative spark with you, no matter the role you play or where you work.

See more of Kate's work at www.kateiversonart.com.Details: Indiegogo campaign This Indiegogo campaign raises capital (net after production costs for the perks) that will help Alice Riot establish operating space and inventory management for future collections. It also provides women with the opportunity to:
own a first-issue, limited-edition collection garment at a 20% discount off retail price;
provide the co-founders with feedback on product features, packaging and shipping, out of box experience, and ideal delivery windows for future orders; and 
help the co-founders build an ideal sales and inventory model for future collections.
The typical working woman spends on average $3,000 each year on her professional wardrobe. By backing this campaign, you'll be dedicating a small portion of your annual spend on clothes for work - and in return:
You'll own a beautiful, well constructed, limited-edition piece that stands out, no matter where you wear it; 
You'll be helping a woman-owned startup stand up its business; and
You will directly support a business that has a clear purpose: to encourage women to lift other women!
An Alice Riot dress, skirt or scarf is a limited-edition print and a wise investment that helps women #WearTheGallery – to bring that creative spark with them, no matter the role they play or where they work.

Our customer archetype is a leader in her work – whether in corporate, arts, entertainment, government or nonprofit sectors.Price point and category comparisonsAlice Riot prides itself on providing women an accessible option to original works of art at a price point comparable with mass-retail women’s apparel brands. The Story of Alice Riot - Kelly Groehler, co-founder and CEOIt started one morning with a simple statement that flew out of my mouth like an expletive:“I want that as a skirt!”It was March 17, 2015. Perched on my couch, I was shopping online and trying to decide what to wear to job interviews. My entire wardrobe was a study in monochromatic, classic styles that I loved: suits, pencil skirts, sheath dresses. But I wanted to add a piece or two that added dimension to my style and spoke to my creative personality. None of the options I found that morning inspired me. I was resigned to invest in yet-another black suit.Then my phone pinged as Kate Iverson, the brilliant contemporary artist, posted one of her latest gorgeous paintings on Instagram. I looked at it, and the idea hit me: I wanted to support my friend’s incredible, striking art – so why not wear it to work?And that was the beginning of Alice Riot.Model: Amanda Brinkman – chief brand and communications officer, Deluxe; series host and executive producer, The Small Business Revolution - Main Street  // Photo: Sarah WhiteAlice Riot speaks to the creative spark that drives our work as women. Through simple, classic cuts, wrinkle-free fabrics, and limited-edition prints, we encourage women at work to celebrate contemporary women artists. We also provide the option for women to invest in the artists’ original works. I'm thrilled that our first collection features ""Riot No. 2"" - the very painting that started Kate and I on this journey together. The name Alice Riot holds special meaning for both Kate and myself. Alice is Kate’s young niece. Alyce is my beloved, late great aunt. Alice Riot honors both the girl and the woman: the encouragement to disrupt tradition, to support each other as women, to embrace creativity and authentically chase our dreams.For centuries, women have driven culture (despite lack of credit) through breakthrough advances in math, science, business and the arts. Today, women are finally making real gains in leadership roles, and we have so much to offer with a more creative, inspired approach each day to our work – including how we dress.An Alice Riot dress, skirt or scarf is a limited-edition print and a wise investment that brings that creative spark with you, no matter the role you play or where you work. We have girls to inspire, women to raise up with us, and a world to change for the better.Let’s get dressed, ladies.Kate & Kelly#WearTheGalleryCo-Founders, Kelly Groehler (L) and Kate Iverson (R) / Photo by Denny ParkSPECIAL THANKS: Studio Six & Flyover Films (video), Sarah White Photography (lookbook)",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>The Tick Toke 4:20 Wristwatch</h3>
<p>Is it 4:20 yet?</p>
<p>If you or someone you admire is apt to ask this question, the Tick Toke 4:20 is the wristwatch for you. It’s a high quality custom-made stainless steel-case beauty sporting reliable performant Japanese quartz and automatic movements. Beyond 4:20 am <i>and</i> pm, this timeless timepiece displays all times of day and night <i>as they happen</i>, offering true chronographic versatility.</p>
<p>No mere pipe dream, the Tick Toke 4:20 has been meticulously designed by a proven watch-development team to manifest the natural synergy between Cannabis Culture and wristwatch enthusiasts. With its durable sapphire crystal, single hand and complement of stylish bands, the Tick Toke will be yours to enjoy for a lifetime — and to bequeath to a worthy heir.</p>
<p>Though less than a decade old, Svalbard Watches, Ltd. has already produced some of the world's finest reasonably priced 24-hour and single-hand watches. They’ve helped us refine the watch’s design, and all Tick Toke 4:20s will be expertly crafted in their dedicated production facility.</p>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1631639299/cu9druo38dp3k01cmafm.png"" src=""""/></h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Tick Toke watches is starting this campaign to begin the process of normalizing Cannabis culture in a post-prohibition world. We want to establish a company that resonates with both collectors of unusual wristwatches and those who enjoy and benefit from Cannabis use. </p>
<p>Watch production is a long, expensive process. This campaign will help us recover the raw materials and production costs to create the first of many annual series of Tick Toke watches.</p>
<p>We have focused on creating watches that are affordable, practical and of high quality for the price. All of our materials and production will be managed by a known, established manufacturer in a biannual production process starting this Autumn, so we need to get some contributions to get our new company rolling. We are looking to fund 50% of the full production and distribution costs of the watches through this campaign and to keep margins and markups low as possible. We all have full-time jobs, so this is a hobby! We don't need or want to make a fortune, we just want people to have these cool watches!</p>
<p>By helping us fund these watches, you will help our company start and grow - and own a unique and special timepiece that is a great conversation starter and a fabulous gift.<br/><br/>Backers will get - your choice of automatic or two styles of quartz watches. Our automatic watch comes in at a comfortable 42mm stainless steel case with a 22mm lug width. For bargain conscious watch collectors, we also offer a 42mm quartz version and slim quartz version that is a 40.5mm x 9mm thin and fashionable case.</p>
<p>With your pledge you will also get your choice of band and an opportunity to purchase add-on bands as well!</p>
<h3>Tick Toke Special Edition</h3>
<p>The Tick Toke Special Edition is limited to TEN WATCHES. Each will have a custom display/storage box, an alligator-style leather deployant band, and your choice of an additional extra band at no cost. The Tick Toke special edition will have custom hands and a unique serial number. These usually go fast!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The decriminalization and legalization of Cannabis products has been a major step forward in combatting a racist and classist bias against people who use mild, generally beneficial elements of the Cannabis plant. After almost a century of failed prohibition, the world is again waking to the benefits of the Cannabis plant - not just from a medical standpoint, but also from an industrial standpoint.</p>
<p>Hemp, which is made from non-psychoactive members of the Cannabis family, may help restore balance to the Earth by consuming massive amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and locking it up in the cellulose and other organic polymers that make this fast growing plant. Hemp plants require little water and practically no fertilizer and produce far more paper than the equivalent acreage of tree and far more cloth than the equivalent acreage of cotton.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Cannabis is still illegal in most states and in many countries, but watches like the Tick Toke are perfectly legal. Nonetheless we are pressing on with our campaign to try and overcome these hurdles. Our goal is to remove this stigma by having high quality fashion accessories for people to show they support legalization and legal medical and recreational use of Cannabis without any kind of stigma.</p>
<p>Also a concern is that this is a joke watch! This is not a joke! It's a damn good watch and you will never need to know how far away 4:20 is. Who could ask for anything more?</p>

<p>Mastectomies save lives but leave visible and invisible scars on women. Lack of confidence, low self esteem and a terrible perspective on their own body image are common feelings among women that go through the process of losing a breast. No surprise that putting a bikini and going to the beach becomes such a challenge.</p>
<p>But it doesn't need to be that way!</p>
<h3>One of Us was created for this reason: for those women who want a fun, safe, easy-to-wear, eco-friendly and chic swimwear that does not define them as breast cancer survivors or patients.</h3>
<p>Our mission is to make these women feel "" One of Us"". Dealing with such a scary prognosis can feel easily overwhelming, but we acknowledge how fashion can be a powerful tool to empower confidence on women of all ages.</p>

<p>One of Us</p>
<p>One of Us is an initiative of swimwear brand AURAI SWIMWEAR, in collaboration with Karin Horen. <a href=""http://www.auraiswimwear.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">AURAI SWIMWEAR</a> is an eco &amp; ethical swimwear brand created by italo-brazilian designer Natalia Bertolo. AURAI SWIMWEAR is based in Auckland and made in Natalia's hometown in southern Brazil. </p>
<p>Karin Horen, twice breast cancer survivor, NZ Starboard ambassador and co-founder of Paddle For Hope, was looking for a mastectomy-friendly swimwear that would suit her lifestyle, age and figure, but she couldn't find what she was looking for.</p>
<p>Very often, swimwear designed especially for women that had mastectomy is not stylish or elegant, and the fit is big and usually representative of an older target audience.  According to the NZ Breast Cancer Foundation, while breast cancer is less common in women under the age of 40, women in their 20s and 30s can get it too (approximately 6% of cases are in this age group). Karin is an example of that, her first breast cancer (and partial mastectomy) happened when she was only 26!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>THE COLLECTION</p>
<p>Functionality is one of the key elements for eco-friendly fashion, so offering innovative and inclusive products is part of AURAI's ethos.</p>
<p>Inspired by Karin's story, Natalia started to research the best way to convert her new collection into mastectomy-friendly designs, without compromising style and silhouette.  AURAI's tops are already fully lined and include removable padding, which makes the project very easy.</p>
<p>Based on the design of a post-mastectomy bra, an extra layer and a small change in the shape of the lining will allow breast cancer survivors to replace the padding with their prosthesis. Simple as that! </p>

<p> </p>
<p>THE MATERIALS</p>
<p>From the SS17/18 collection, AURAI started using ECONYL®, a revolutionary polyamide fibre made from 100% regenerated material, pre and post-consumer nylon waste such as nylon plastic scraps, old carpets and fish nets that litter our oceans.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>For the SS18/19 collection, AURAI is also introducing AMNI SOUL ECO®, made from a polyamide with an improved formulation that accelerates biodegradation in the anaerobic (oxygen-free) environment, common in most landfills. As the clothes break down quicker, the impact on landfills is reduced. </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<p>THE PLEDGE</p>
<p>We decided to open a crowdfunding project to share our idea with the community, hopefully inspiring other businesses to take action and improve their designs to be more inclusive. Also, because making the swimwear mastectomy-friendly will incur a few extra costs, especially for manufacturing and materials. To create the ""pocket"" where the prosthesis go, 2 layers of lining is necessary, so it's imperceptible when the top is worn. Below an overview of our cost structure. If you have any questions, please contact us and we'll be happy to help!</p>

<p>MANUFACTURING is definitely the biggest portion of our budget. Swimwear is a very specific product and it requires skillful workmanship. AURAI SWIMWEAR is proud to work with an ethical family-run small atelier in Natalia's hometown in southern Brazil.</p>
<p>MATERIALS represent nearly 25% of our budget. AURAI collections use Econyl, a fabric that is 100% regenerated nylon ( from old carpets, recovered fish nets and other recyclable plastics) and Amni Soul Eco, a biodegradable yarn that decompose in only 5 years in an anaerobic environment. </p>
<p>PRINTS represent approximately 15% of our costs. All our prints are exclusive ( meaning they are our own designs) and made with digital print, a low-impact technique that doesn't require water or harmful chemicals, and it's zero waste.</p>
<p>PACKAGING AND LABELS include sew-in labels, paper tags, fabric drawstring bag, recycled paper box, ecc.</p>

<p>Very important! The rewards can be chosen from the entire AURAI SWIMWEAR collection (SS18/19)!

<p>Jehan, the brand behind Mosneaks, is a Canadian fusion fashion apparel brand embodying the Woman of the World; the woman who is industrious, fierce and empathetic. Our vision exudes the right amount of pantones and block colors, all the while culminating the simplicity and elegance of diverse crafts and cultures.</p>
<p>We are currently in the works, and have launched our first line of Mosneaks. ""Mosneaks"" are a modern day version of the Mojaris (centuries old footwear produced by artisans from the South Asian region), combined with a sleek white sole for that perfect edgy look. Each Mosneak has a memory foam insole cushioning, so all you gorgeous ladies out there don't have to compromise on comfort! </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1524531577/zocdq3eygnu6woizc8bi.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>How did we establish this brand ?</strong></p>
<p>The brand Jehan was launched amidst the rising need for something different and unique; something that was not found at every store. Something that felt good to wear, yet does not let you compromise on comfort, style or money. Something that was well made and gave you your moneys worth. Style continues to evolve, however we rarely see new concepts being introduced in the fashion market. As a fashion enthusiast, I always found it difficult to shop, and reasons were the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apparel that was well-made was expensive</li>
<li>Apparel that was in my budget was not stylish</li>
<li>If it was stylish, it was not well-made and not good quality</li>
<li>Footwear from leading brands was way out of my budget</li>
<li>Footwear that was in my budget was not comfortable</li>
<li>Footwear in my budget and stylish was never comfortable - had to bear a few blisters before I broke into them</li>
<li>Footwear that was stylish, comfortable for walking around and budget-friendly was no where to be found</li>
<li>Lastly, all stores carried the same thing, nothing ""new"" was ever to be found and my creative mind was always looking for something unique </li>
</ul>
<p>All of these struggles compelled me to work on a brand that was budget-friendly, stylish, well-made and a time-capsule collection in itself. Therefore I launched Mosneaks, an entirely new concept in the footwear industry that is an epitome of the brand's philosophy, unique, comfortable and creative footwear.</p>
<p><strong>What have we done so far ? </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Found a manufacturer and established a relationship with them - A manufacturer who was willing to work with my idea of a shoe that they had never seen before.</li>
<li>Successfully designed the prototypes of six Mosneaks designs</li>
<li>Set up our website</li>
<li>Did a fashion shoot with the help of friends - yes we have creative friends too ;) </li>
<li>With a few personal savings, ordered a few pairs for each design to finally get our online store going</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> How can you help us ?</strong></p>
<p>We now need your help in ensuring we have our production going for the six beautiful designs of our first collection of Mosneaks, since we have very limited inventory.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>How much funding do we need ? <strong>$10,000</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>$<strong>8000 </strong>towards the production cost ( materials, manufacturing, packaging ) </li>
<li>$<strong>2000 </strong>towards shipping costs, handling, duties from the production country to Canada</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Mosneaks have received great feedback from people who have bought them! They're comfortable, stylish, unique, and at a fraction of the price considering their quality and make. The world needs a place for apparel that is creative and practical, and we need your help in ensuring our Mosneaks find their way into the fashion world! </p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Every business has challenges, we encountered a few as well on our journey so far. What might they be ? </p>
<ul>
<li>One of the greatest risks was finding a manufacturer who understood the concept. It took months to find someone who understood exactly what I was trying to create. We have a great relationship with our supplier and samples for each design and hence we've overcome this problem</li>
<li>Another challenge was convincing the manufacturer to produce below their required MOQ for our first shipment. However, they believed in the product and they believed in our love for the product and hence helped us. There were tradeoffs though, we had to pay a higher price/pair for a lower MOQ per design.</li>
<li>With your help, we can ensure we meet their MOQs for our next order, which means a lower cost price, which leads to a lower selling price as well.</li>

<p>We have had many people who have loved our Mosneaks, believed in the concept and the design, but cannot back us up financially. If you are one of them, not to worry! We appreciate all the love and support we can get, help us spread the word about these one of a kind shoes!</p>
</div></div>","Who are we ? 
Jehan, the brand behind Mosneaks, is a Canadian fusion fashion apparel brand embodying the Woman of the World; the woman who is industrious, fierce and empathetic. Our vision exudes the right amount of pantones and block colors, all the while culminating the simplicity and elegance of diverse crafts and cultures.
We are currently in the works, and have launched our first line of Mosneaks. ""Mosneaks"" are a modern day version of the Mojaris (centuries old footwear produced by artisans from the South Asian region), combined with a sleek white sole for that perfect edgy look. Each Mosneak has a memory foam insole cushioning, so all you gorgeous ladies out there don't have to compromise on comfort! 

How did we establish this brand ?
The brand Jehan was launched amidst the rising need for something different and unique; something that was not found at every store. Something that felt good to wear, yet does not let you compromise on comfort, style or money. Something that was well made and gave you your moneys worth. Style continues to evolve, however we rarely see new concepts being introduced in the fashion market. As a fashion enthusiast, I always found it difficult to shop, and reasons were the following:

Apparel that was well-made was expensive
Apparel that was in my budget was not stylish
If it was stylish, it was not well-made and not good quality
Footwear from leading brands was way out of my budget
Footwear that was in my budget was not comfortable
Footwear in my budget and stylish was never comfortable - had to bear a few blisters before I broke into them
Footwear that was stylish, comfortable for walking around and budget-friendly was no where to be found
Lastly, all stores carried the same thing, nothing ""new"" was ever to be found and my creative mind was always looking for something unique 

All of these struggles compelled me to work on a brand that was budget-friendly, stylish, well-made and a time-capsule collection in itself. Therefore I launched Mosneaks, an entirely new concept in the footwear industry that is an epitome of the brand's philosophy, unique, comfortable and creative footwear.
What have we done so far ? 

Found a manufacturer and established a relationship with them - A manufacturer who was willing to work with my idea of a shoe that they had never seen before.
Successfully designed the prototypes of six Mosneaks designs
Set up our website
Did a fashion shoot with the help of friends - yes we have creative friends too ;) 
With a few personal savings, ordered a few pairs for each design to finally get our online store going

 How can you help us ?
We now need your help in ensuring we have our production going for the six beautiful designs of our first collection of Mosneaks, since we have very limited inventory.

 
What We Need
How much funding do we need ? $10,000

$8000 towards the production cost ( materials, manufacturing, packaging ) 
$2000 towards shipping costs, handling, duties from the production country to Canada

 

The Impact
Mosneaks have received great feedback from people who have bought them! They're comfortable, stylish, unique, and at a fraction of the price considering their quality and make. The world needs a place for apparel that is creative and practical, and we need your help in ensuring our Mosneaks find their way into the fashion world! 

 
Risks & Challenges
Every business has challenges, we encountered a few as well on our journey so far. What might they be ? 

One of the greatest risks was finding a manufacturer who understood the concept. It took months to find someone who understood exactly what I was trying to create. We have a great relationship with our supplier and samples for each design and hence we've overcome this problem
Another challenge was convincing the manufacturer to produce below their required MOQ for our first shipment. However, they believed in the product and they believed in our love for the product and hence helped us. There were tradeoffs though, we had to pay a higher price/pair for a lower MOQ per design.
With your help, we can ensure we meet their MOQs for our next order, which means a lower cost price, which leads to a lower selling price as well.

<p>Hello! My name is Glenda Pettaway. I am the owner of K.E.M. Supply Enterprises Group LLC located in Detroit, Michigan.  We are<strong> “<i>A company on a mission with a vision to get it done.”</i></strong> I am a 58-year-old mother of two (Gabriel, 35 and Kayla, 21) with one grandson (Michael, 3). I grew up in Detroit since the age of five and I remember the vibrant neighborhoods and the bustling manufacturing that went on in the city.  As a retired Chrysler worker of 10 years, I established this company out of a need for my son and other mothers’ children who were coming from a past that left them unable to find decent employment opportunities. My thought was that if other employers wouldn’t give them a good job, I would create one for them.  Gratefully, in 2015, my son and a few other individuals were able to secure productive employment. However, there are so many others who are still in need of good employment. Through this experience, I discovered that the need I had to elevate my own son was also a need to elevate other sons and daughters.  This vision could only be accomplished through outreach and job creation and these two projects needed long-term funding. This vision is the driving force behind me and my company.  The magnitude of what each contributor can help us achieve by way of this campaign is life-altering on so many levels.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>I am seeking to raise $110,000.  This campaign is intended to be a vehicle for funding the production and distribution of my company’s patented K.E.M. Wear Uniform Blouse w/underpinning. Our blouse comes in four colors: white, blue, pink and yellow. It also comes in two styles: short sleeve and long sleeve. The vision for the blouse will unfold in two stages. <strong>Stage #1,</strong> I will use the funds to have the blouse manufactured in the U.S. by Velvet Vision in San Diego, CA. and shipped to our Logistic and Fulfillment Center (Evans Distributions) here in Detroit. Evans will handle orders from all sales venues.  This point is very important to me because I want the blouse to be produced in America in order to support the resurgence of manufacturing here, particularly here in Detroit.<strong>  </strong>The funds will also be used for the marketing campaigns for our e-commerce website via Twitter, Facebook etc., as well as targeted electronic direct mail. We are positioned for the opportunity which will enable our blouse to be sold on three major cable shopping channels. We will also purchase two delivery trucks for the east side and the west side deliveries of the sales generated through local school uniform stores and charter and parochial schools. </p>
<p><strong>Stage #2 is long term</strong>. Funds generated from sales will then fund the company’s vision of job creation, as we eventually begin manufacturing the blouse ourselves. I envision creating jobs for the citizens of Detroit and other impoverished cities across America by reopening one of the five smaller manufacturing plants now closed here in Detroit. The healthy and productive restoration of any of these smaller plants revitalizes our neighborhood and community for my grandson and the many families living in the plight of the poverty which surrounds us.  It is a bold vision, nevertheless, an achievable one as we focus on <strong>“one blouse at a time.”</strong> With your help, this campaign will launch the  K.E.M. Wear Uniform Blouse in the trajectory of the second major step towards our vision.  My fervent hope and unwavering faith are that it will touch lives for the better and secure a future for the community of young people that I can reach.  My heart is to help as many as I can to be better and do better <strong>“one blouse at a time”</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Impact (SEE ABOVE)</strong></p>
<p>This project is valuable to you, the contributors. Any effort that you make toward affecting positive change in someone’s life by helping them rise up from their lowest point adds momentum to an immediately better world at large. This may sound a little corny; nevertheless, it is so true! What you make happen for someone else opens the door for it to happen for you too. My success is only demonstrated by the fact that I made it to this point.  However, with your help, I know that I can finish the journey with an even greater level of success!!!</p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>In 2015, I began this journey by cobbling together my first prototype of the uniform blouse and contacting Wal-Mart.  They were impressed but told me I was not far enough along in the manufacturing process. I have faced many obstacles and setbacks. Each setback only served to fuel my determination to see and be the change I am striving for.  From then until now, I have worked hard to educate myself and become knowledgeable in this area. My hard work allowed me to receive my patent for the blouse and a Wal-Mart <strong>vendor’s contract</strong>. The task was daunting; however, with grace, favor and hard work, it was done.  The first leg of the journey, I believe, qualified me for the next step. It taught me diligence, tenancy, humility and gave me an ability to adjust and educate myself as needed.  It taught me that the vision is at an appointed time and not to give up.  I now understand that if I wait (stay diligent, work hard) for it, it would surely come to fruition one day. Financing this vision has been elusive because I have run into some unrelenting obstacles via the conventional way—until now. Because I did not give up, I heard about Indiegogo. Indiegogo’s platform allows me to take the blouse to its next level by seeking help and support from other people, who “get” the struggle and the drive to see a vision come to fruition. I am trusting that there are people who have the heart to see positive change implemented by one company that will then affect one life, one family, one neighborhood, and one community through the production and selling of  <strong>“one blouse at a time.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>For those of you who can help monetarily, I thank you. Your financial donations are needed and appreciated. I trust that this campaign will do exceedingly and abundantly more than I could ask or imagine. Once again, thank you!!! For those who have a desire to give but are unable to (I’ve been there many times), I ask for your support by making some noise and getting the word out regarding this unique, patented uniform blouse.  Please use the Indiegogo share tool.  Thank you in advance for your support in either way. It is greatly appreciated!!!</p>

<p>Swiss company Osmotex has developed a revolutionary <strong>actively</strong> sterilising textile - the Osmotex Steriliser! Our new product is developed with many years of experience of specialising in electro osmotic and electro chemical reactions in textiles and membranes.</p>
<p>Osmotex Steriliser is a quick, effective, safe and environmentally friendly technology.  Through a controlled interaction of moisture and electric pulses we create an anti-viral and anti-bacterial effect inside and on the surface of a textile, proven by the Zürich University of Applied Sciences.

The face mask is a reusable textile facemask with a lifespan of two months. In addition to the Osmotex Steriliser technology, we have also implemented a N95 filter to meet the regular standards for face masks and optimise the safety for the wearer. The mask is powered by a fully reusable electronic control unit connected to the face mask with a textile cable. In our initial production we use a control box the user can put in a pocket, but in the volume production we are setting up we are planning to integrate the control box on the back of the head - similar to a head-light.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1607353401/x48techfez0lxql8lxon.png"" src=""""/></p><p>The Osmotex Steriliser facemask is unique, as the textile is auto-sterilising and protecting the wearer from breathing in virus, and at the same time the sterilising effect allows the wearer to touch the mask without the risk of contamination. As part of a usability study, the facemask has been used for several weeks at the Pfützner Science &amp; Health Institute in Mainz, Germany. On this base we have gained important feedback including the usability of the mask design, but also a solid confirmation that the safety and protection provided meets the standards of a professional medical institute with daily patient contact.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1606741498/iqmy7rp7mzrbnbi7q4ez.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>The usage areas of our sterilising textile are practically limitless, and we plan to extend the product range in the first stage with a sterilising bag. Later development is planned to include textiles for different touch surfaces in places like shops, offices, medical institutions etc. This will strongly reduce the risk of touch contamination in public spaces, hence potentially contribute strongly to a general reduced risk for spreading of viruses on a larger scale.  Sterilising apparel and other equipment within the health sector is also on the agenda.</p><p>Here is a video of our proto Osmotex Steriliser bag for effective sterilisation of personal belongings:</p><div>

</div><p>The Osmotex Steriliser technology is highly innovative and revolutionary. The technology is positioned to make a difference for both the user of Osmotex Steriliser application, as well as the global society. The high and rapid sterilising effect protects the user from negative impact from virus and bacterias, including the Covid-19 virus. In addition, the technology has the potential to reduce the infection and contamination risks through immediate and effective sterilisation of masks, touch surfaces and in the end clothes worn by professionals in health care, as well as non-professionals. The technology is easy to implement on applications that are stationary and fixed, as well as non-stationary applications. Osmotex Steriliser is powered by moisture and electric pulses from a small battery. There are no need for added chemicals and the technology does not represent any risk for the users, the surroundings or the environment.  </p><p>To bring this unique technology to the market we have teamed up with the Swiss company <strong>Topa Konfektions AG</strong> (<a href=""http://www.topa-ag.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.topa-ag.com</a>) as our main development partner. Topa brings a very high expertise on implementing high-tech in textiles to the cooperation.

Development and production of electronics is done by <strong>VarioSystems AG</strong> (<a href=""http://www.variosystems.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.variosystems.com</a>)</p><p>We aim to reach a funding of CHF 200 000 with this campaign and will use the funds to finance set up costs and the start of volume production for masks and electronics. Our first priority is  to finance the production to deliver the perks, although the early bird perks are already produced and ready for immediate delivery in January 2021. </p><p>This campaign is important for us to continue our work to further develop new products, not reaching our funding goal is what we see as our biggest risk. We know from experience that building a volume production always will include the need to solve arising challenges and hurdles, but based on the extensive experience within our partnership team we are confident that we will solve the challenges ahead.   </p><p>We need all the help we can get to spread the word of this unique new product and we hope that you will support us with both funding and promoting within your network. </p><p>If you have any question relates to our technology, please take a look at the Q &amp; A's or email us at info@osmotex.ch. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1607354052/z31qdru8jgbkltc7plsw.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1607355245/fv5ficzsivmduhslupxc.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1607355273/xkqxwigdmphqklt0a8vk.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1607355294/pm1kh0jyuggsn9j0xyuq.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1607355311/ph4uqfby7m8ih73fzw1n.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h3> </h3></div>","Swiss company Osmotex has developed a revolutionary actively sterilising textile - the Osmotex Steriliser! Our new product is developed with many years of experience of specialising in electro osmotic and electro chemical reactions in textiles and membranes.

Osmotex Steriliser being tested at the lab of Zürich university of Applied Sciences The Osmotex Sterilser kills 99,999% of viruses and bacteria within minutes based on interaction of moisture and electric pulse creating sterilising agents O3 and H2O2 in quantities that are completely harmless for humans but deadly for all viruses. The effect of the Osmotex Steriliser kills viruses and bacteria extremely rapid compared to other passive technologies using up to two hours to achieve a sterilising effect:The Osmotex Steriliser cannot be compared to passive technologies based on passive properties of metal yarns and coatings, as the effect of these technologies are depending on the microorganisms to get in contact with the passive elements of the textile - opposite to the Osmotex Steriliser active sterilisation where the sterilising agents hunt down and eradicate any virus and bacterias.   The Osmotex Steriliser face mask is our first commercial sterilising product. The face mask is a reusable textile facemask with a lifespan of two months. In addition to the Osmotex Steriliser technology, we have also implemented a N95 filter to meet the regular standards for face masks and optimise the safety for the wearer. The mask is powered by a fully reusable electronic control unit connected to the face mask with a textile cable. In our initial production we use a control box the user can put in a pocket, but in the volume production we are setting up we are planning to integrate the control box on the back of the head - similar to a head-light.The Osmotex Steriliser facemask is unique, as the textile is auto-sterilising and protecting the wearer from breathing in virus, and at the same time the sterilising effect allows the wearer to touch the mask without the risk of contamination. As part of a usability study, the facemask has been used for several weeks at the Pfützner Science & Health Institute in Mainz, Germany. On this base we have gained important feedback including the usability of the mask design, but also a solid confirmation that the safety and protection provided meets the standards of a professional medical institute with daily patient contact. The usage areas of our sterilising textile are practically limitless, and we plan to extend the product range in the first stage with a sterilising bag. Later development is planned to include textiles for different touch surfaces in places like shops, offices, medical institutions etc. This will strongly reduce the risk of touch contamination in public spaces, hence potentially contribute strongly to a general reduced risk for spreading of viruses on a larger scale.  Sterilising apparel and other equipment within the health sector is also on the agenda.Here is a video of our proto Osmotex Steriliser bag for effective sterilisation of personal belongings:

 
The Osmotex Steriliser technology is highly innovative and revolutionary. The technology is positioned to make a difference for both the user of Osmotex Steriliser application, as well as the global society. The high and rapid sterilising effect protects the user from negative impact from virus and bacterias, including the Covid-19 virus. In addition, the technology has the potential to reduce the infection and contamination risks through immediate and effective sterilisation of masks, touch surfaces and in the end clothes worn by professionals in health care, as well as non-professionals. The technology is easy to implement on applications that are stationary and fixed, as well as non-stationary applications. Osmotex Steriliser is powered by moisture and electric pulses from a small battery. There are no need for added chemicals and the technology does not represent any risk for the users, the surroundings or the environment.  To bring this unique technology to the market we have teamed up with the Swiss company Topa Konfektions AG (www.topa-ag.com) as our main development partner. Topa brings a very high expertise on implementing high-tech in textiles to the cooperation. We have also engaged the Zürich University of Applied Sciences (Zürcher Hochschule für Angewandte Wissenschaften - www.zhaw.ch) to take handle laboratory testing, independent evaluation and advising. Our main medical advisor is the Pfützner Science & Health Institute in Mainz, Germany (www.pfuetzner-mainz.com). We use high quality textiles from WidePlus International Co., Ltd, New Taipei City, Taiwan (www.wideplustex.com). Development and production of electronics is done by VarioSystems AG (www.variosystems.com)We aim to reach a funding of CHF 200 000 with this campaign and will use the funds to finance set up costs and the start of volume production for masks and electronics. Our first priority is  to finance the production to deliver the perks, although the early bird perks are already produced and ready for immediate delivery in January 2021. This campaign is important for us to continue our work to further develop new products, not reaching our funding goal is what we see as our biggest risk. We know from experience that building a volume production always will include the need to solve arising challenges and hurdles, but based on the extensive experience within our partnership team we are confident that we will solve the challenges ahead.   We need all the help we can get to spread the word of this unique new product and we hope that you will support us with both funding and promoting within your network. If you have any question relates to our technology, please take a look at the Q & A's or email us at info@osmotex.ch.",9.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p>We are so stoked to share our first ever Kickstarter campaign with you!  We're passionate about making a hat that can be worn, beat up, washed, and packed for any and all of your adventures and still rebound to keep its shape and crisp, good-as-new look.   We wanted a hat for EVRYday use, for EVRYone, and can withstand EVRYactivity.  </p>
<p>Why the name Movi?  Movi comes from the latin root Movere meaning to mean or be moved.   We created Movi to 1) be the absolute best technical and durable trucker in the market and 2) create a motivational message within the hat to get people moving and advancing their life story and reaching their goals EVRYday. </p>

<p>To answer this question, we asked why do some people end up ditching their favorite Trucker Hats because EVRYone loves a good Trucker until…..</p>
<p>...it gets accidentally sat on, or squished, or bent during packing and loses that crisp front-panel look.  Or that white salty sweatband develops over a hot summer day and then it just looks gross and if you wash it, it then looks deformed.  Or perhaps mid day when you just can’t take the squeezing, pressing forehead pressure of the front brim digging into your noggin and you’d rather ditch the hat to relieve yourself of your now headache but you’re hairs a mess so you deal with it.</p>
<p>So what’s different about the MOVI Trucker? We set out to create the ultimate Trucker Hat that would address everything current Trucker hats don’t. We wanted a hat that could be stuffed, rolled, packed and that would still look good and rebound to its original shape post. A hat that after a 4 day through a hike, you could machine wash it and it would look good as new.  A hat that was super lightweight, form-fitting right out of the box, and could be worn all day, EVRYday with a non-existent feel.  Ultimately a Trucker that could create history with you each step of your journey and one you’d never have to toss.  Welcome to a new Hat regimen: Smash, Pack, Wear, Wash - REPEAT.</p>

<p>While being Packable - this hat is also reboundable; meaning no matter what you cram this hat into, once you pull it out and give it a few seconds it will rebound back to its original, crispy look. You'll be AMAZED at what this hat can go through and then come back to life to and keep it's shape.  No more worrying about your hat accidentally getting a crease, wrinkle, or getting smashed and never looking good again. </p>

</div></div>","We are so stoked to share our first ever Kickstarter campaign with you!  We're passionate about making a hat that can be worn, beat up, washed, and packed for any and all of your adventures and still rebound to keep its shape and crisp, good-as-new look.   We wanted a hat for EVRYday use, for EVRYone, and can withstand EVRYactivity.  
Why the name Movi?  Movi comes from the latin root Movere meaning to mean or be moved.   We created Movi to 1) be the absolute best technical and durable trucker in the market and 2) create a motivational message within the hat to get people moving and advancing their life story and reaching their goals EVRYday.

To answer this question, we asked why do some people end up ditching their favorite Trucker Hats because EVRYone loves a good Trucker until…..
...it gets accidentally sat on, or squished, or bent during packing and loses that crisp front-panel look.  Or that white salty sweatband develops over a hot summer day and then it just looks gross and if you wash it, it then looks deformed.  Or perhaps mid day when you just can’t take the squeezing, pressing forehead pressure of the front brim digging into your noggin and you’d rather ditch the hat to relieve yourself of your now headache but you’re hairs a mess so you deal with it.
So what’s different about the MOVI Trucker? We set out to create the ultimate Trucker Hat that would address everything current Trucker hats don’t. We wanted a hat that could be stuffed, rolled, packed and that would still look good and rebound to its original shape post. A hat that after a 4 day through a hike, you could machine wash it and it would look good as new.  A hat that was super lightweight, form-fitting right out of the box, and could be worn all day, EVRYday with a non-existent feel.  Ultimately a Trucker that could create history with you each step of your journey and one you’d never have to toss.  Welcome to a new Hat regimen: Smash, Pack, Wear, Wash - REPEAT.

Yes, this hat you can actually CRUSH into your bag or suitcase for your hike or while you travel.  No more worrying about permanent creases, wrinkles or your hat losing it's shape - the Movi hat can be completely smashed and will come back to it's original shape. 
GIF SMASHING THE HAT




 
 
 

 
While being Packable - this hat is also reboundable; meaning no matter what you cram this hat into, once you pull it out and give it a few seconds it will rebound back to its original, crispy look. You'll be AMAZED at what this hat can go through and then come back to life to and keep it's shape.  No more worrying about your hat accidentally getting a crease, wrinkle, or getting smashed and never looking good again.

OTHER PIC OF HAT 


 
Due to the careful selection of foams, padding and rigid material the hat rebounds once pulled out of the bottom of your duffle, day pack or suitcase in a matter of seconds.
  

 
 
This hat was built to breath for your outdoor adventures. Fully lined QUIK WIK MESH material and it’s blend of breathable polyfoam and hex mesh backing, staying cool on a high-intensity run, ski, hike or climb is a cinch for the hat.

Movi has been tested on a wide range of heads and every time the feedback is overwhelming at how comfortable this thing is!  This hat can be worn for hours and you won't feel any pressure points of discomfort in your forehead or anywhere really.  This hat is a go-to for trail runners, travelers, hikers, backpackers, rocker climbers and even walkers, and drivers.



 
When the sun’s out or you're simply wanting to look good on the weekend, the weight, feel, and nature of the hat seems non-existent while still providing all the shade, effects and appearance you're looking for without that squeezing, pressing, and forehead pressure.
 


 
 

 
We wouldn’t have included this if it didn’t mean a more advanced product than the status quo.  We truly feel and believe with all it’s features and benefits this is possibly the most technical (trucker style) hat on the market. 






 
 


 
Once your activity comes to a halt, so does the sweat, dirt, dust and grime - on your hat that is. No worries though, throw your Movi hat directly in the wash for that brand-new out of the box look.

contribuire in maniera attiva e positiva alla diffusione di una<b> cultura 
eco friendly</b>. Poiché al giorno d'oggi viviamo tutto in maniera veloce e 
frenetica, si sente il bisogno di rallentare, <b>tornare alle origini</b>, alle
 nostre fondamenta, semplicemente di poter avere maggiore consapevolezza
 e coscienza di ciò che ci circonda. Quindi crediamo che ogni singola 
azione rivolta al <b>rispetto della natura ed alla salvaguardia 
dell'ambiente</b>, contribuisca a un generale miglioramento dell'intero 
pianeta. Attraverso una progressiva progettazione di <b>design, semplicità 
ed ecosostenibilità</b>, il compito principale di Elemento è dunque di 
impegnarsi a creare delle collezioni di orologi da polso in legno 
derivante da foreste giapponesi a raccolto controllato. Tutto questo per
 dare un ulteriore sostegno ad una nostra azienda Partner, una delle tante realtà italiane 
che si occupa di creare nuove aree boschive per la riduzione di 
emissioni nocive nell'atmosfera. Da qui proprio l'idea che ogni nostro 
orologio sarà venduto con un certificato che attesti la coltivazione di 
una pianta, la quale sarà geolocalizzata per poter mostrare 
concretamente il contributo che ogni singola persona vorrà dare a questo
 progetto.</p><p>Ora siamo qui, su Indiegogo, con un prototipo completamente funzionale. <b>Abbiamo solo bisogno di una cosa ... il vostro sostegno!</b></p><p>
<b>Gli orologi ELEMENTO sono venduti con la 
Garanzia internazionale. Noi siamo così sicuri della qualità e la durata
 dei nostri orologi, ma se qualcosa dovesse accadere entro il primo 
anno, non esitate a spedirci indietro l'orologio. Questa garanzia copre i
 difetti di fabbricazione su l'orologio stesso (movimento, vetro 
rovinato).</b><br/>La riparazione / sostituzione sarà addebitata nei seguenti casi, anche durante il periodo di garanzia.
 - Danni causati da un uso improprio o disattenzione (colpi, ammaccature, urti, vetro rotto, ecc)
 - Danni causati da riparazione o modifica ingiustificabile
 - Danni causati dal fuoco o acqua
 - Cambiamenti estetici che si verificano 
durante la normale usura e di invecchiamento (piccoli graffi sul vetro, 
alterazione del colore sul cinturino)
 - Nel caso in cui la vendita al dettaglio
 e la data di acquisto non sono indicati su questa garanzia o se queste 
informazioni sono state riscritte.
<span> - Se la garanzia non è presentata insieme con l'orologio.</span></p><p>L’idea affonda le sue radici dalla mente

We Need Your Support

We need YOU, too! We remind you that Indiegogo will allow us to raise the
funds only if we reach our goal. We will try to promote the project in
different ways,online and offline, and we hope, through the use of social media
and the blogs we can address all traffic here. Sharing the page, promoting the
project, publishing picture with the #hashtag elementowatches You can really
contribute to the spread of this fund-raiser. You have just to subscribe in the
Facebook page and Instagram to receive the latest news and share it with all
your friends and the followers of our work.

If funded, how will
you fulfill the orders?

We have 
optimised the initial prototype, studied the different kinds of wood,
perfected the design and choose our producer who has a great experience in our
business.Once the Indiegogo campaign is over and
we'll get your funds, we can start the production which could take about 30
days according to the amount of the order. We'll do everything we can to
respect the time of delivery and we'll keep you updated about your order.
Risks and
challenges
The challenge for Elemento Watches are
many. Once  we collected funds that are
necessary  to production we will try all
over the world to promote our watches with our echo-loyal concept.
To make this work we need the help of
all to spread this project: blogger, friends, relatives, magazines, every
channel is important to bring more and more visibility to our collection.Some features may change the original watches. It all depends if we reach our goal .Lo scopo primario è quello di poter 
contribuire in maniera attiva e positiva alla diffusione di una cultura 
eco friendly. Poiché al giorno d'oggi viviamo tutto in maniera veloce e 
frenetica, si sente il bisogno di rallentare, tornare alle origini, alle
 nostre fondamenta, semplicemente di poter avere maggiore consapevolezza
 e coscienza di ciò che ci circonda. Quindi crediamo che ogni singola 
azione rivolta al rispetto della natura ed alla salvaguardia 
dell'ambiente, contribuisca a un generale miglioramento dell'intero 
pianeta. Attraverso una progressiva progettazione di design, semplicità 
ed ecosostenibilità, il compito principale di Elemento è dunque di 
impegnarsi a creare delle collezioni di orologi da polso in legno 
derivante da foreste giapponesi a raccolto controllato. Tutto questo per
 dare un ulteriore sostegno ad una nostra azienda Partner, una delle tante realtà italiane 
che si occupa di creare nuove aree boschive per la riduzione di 
emissioni nocive nell'atmosfera. Da qui proprio l'idea che ogni nostro 
orologio sarà venduto con un certificato che attesti la coltivazione di 
una pianta, la quale sarà geolocalizzata per poter mostrare 
concretamente il contributo che ogni singola persona vorrà dare a questo
 progetto.Ora siamo qui, su Indiegogo, con un prototipo completamente funzionale. Abbiamo solo bisogno di una cosa ... il vostro sostegno!
Gli orologi ELEMENTO sono venduti con la 
Garanzia internazionale. Noi siamo così sicuri della qualità e la durata
 dei nostri orologi, ma se qualcosa dovesse accadere entro il primo 
anno, non esitate a spedirci indietro l'orologio. Questa garanzia copre i
 difetti di fabbricazione su l'orologio stesso (movimento, vetro 
rovinato).La riparazione / sostituzione sarà addebitata nei seguenti casi, anche durante il periodo di garanzia.
 - Danni causati da un uso improprio o disattenzione (colpi, ammaccature, urti, vetro rotto, ecc)
 - Danni causati da riparazione o modifica ingiustificabile
 - Danni causati dal fuoco o acqua
 - Cambiamenti estetici che si verificano 
durante la normale usura e di invecchiamento (piccoli graffi sul vetro, 
alterazione del colore sul cinturino)
 - Nel caso in cui la vendita al dettaglio
 e la data di acquisto non sono indicati su questa garanzia o se queste 
informazioni sono state riscritte.
 - Se la garanzia non è presentata insieme con l'orologio.L’idea affonda le sue radici dalla mente 
di Davide Zanon, un giovane imprenditore appassionato di fotografia e amante 
dei viaggi. Stanco della routine e affascinato dalla cultura orientale 
incontra in Germania Mayo, una ragazza giapponese con la quale condivide
 il suo sogno di poter contribuire alla salvaguardia dell’ambiente, da 
quel momento, tornato in Italia comincia a sviluppare la sua idea 
imprenditoriale che potesse permettere a tutti di poterlo aiutare a 
finanziare i suoi progetti legati all’ambiente. Nel suo percorso 
incontra l’amico Geshe Mancini, un giovane regista cinematografico ed insieme 
pianificano ogni dettaglio di promozione e comunicazione online e 
offline. Nel team, fanno parte anche Marco Trestini (marketing), Amina 
(traduttrice), Matteo (controllo qualità e sviluppo), Fabiano 
(fotografo).C'è bisogno anche di VOI!!
 Ricordiamo che Indiegogo ci permetterà di raccogliere i fondi solo al raggiungimento del nostro goal.
 Noi cercheremo di promuovere il progetto 
in tutti i canali online e offline e ci auguriamo che attraverso l’uso 
dei social media e dei blog riusciremo ad indirizzare tutto il traffico 
qui.
 Condividendo la pagina, promuovendo il 
progetto, pubblicando foto con l’hashtag #elementowatches si può davvero
 contribuire alla diffusione di questa raccolta fondi. E’ sufficiente 
iscriversi alla pagina Facebook e Instagram per ricevere le ultime 
notizie ed avere modo di condividere a tutti i vostri amici e followers 
il nostro lavoro.Abbiamo ottimizzato il prototipo iniziale,
 studiato i vari tipi di legno, perfezionato il design e selezionato il 
nostro produttore che una grande esperienza nel nostro settore.
 Una volta che la campagna Indiegogo sarà 
finita e riceveremo i vostri fondi potremo avviare la produzione la 
quale richederà circa 30 giorni a seconda della quantità dell’ordine. 
Faremo il possibile per rispettare i tempi di consegna e tenervi 
aggiornati sul vostro ordine.Le sfide per Elemento watches sono 
moteplici. Una volta raccolti i fondi neccessari alla produzione 
cercheremo di promuovere i nostri orologi insieme al nostro concept eco 
solidale in tutto il mondo.
 Perché questo possa funzionare 
abbiamo bisogno dell’aiuto di tutti per diffondere questo progetto: 
blogger, amici, parenti, riviste, ogni canale è importante per portare 
maggiore visibilità alla nostra raccolta fondi.",12.0,2,"2 Campaigns

<h4><b>BACKGROUND</b></h4>
<p>My name is Tim Scapillato. I live in Wakefield, Quebec, Canada. For me, 2015 is a year of milestones.<br/></p>
<p>Thirty years ago, in the spring of 1985, I quit smoking and took up running. In fairly short order, I became a marathon runner and set my sights on the Boston Marathon. I ran my first one in 1991, and since then have completed 13 more. I will be returning this year for my 15th Boston Marathon. Another milestone.</p>
<p>But this one is going to be special in another way, because I'm using it to raise funds for an organization called <a href=""http://www.wonwithone.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><b>Won With One.</b> </a></p>
<p>Won with One supports people who are visually or physically challenged to realize their dreams as athletes in the sport of triathlon by providing equipment, opportunities and solutions. We support their individual journeys to leave the sidelines and step onto the race course to experience the empowerment that comes from crossing a finish line.</p>

<p>Won with One helps physically and visually challenged athletes re-imagine what can be achieved by building a community of support which transforms lives and breaks down barriers.</p>
<p>In 2010 I joined Won With One as an athlete guide. Since then I have guided blind and visually challenged athletes in triathlons and marathons. I guided a blind runner in the 2011, 2012 and 2013 Boston Marathons. Running Boston is an experience like no other, but running it as a set of eyes for a blind runner made it even more special. <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tim-scapillato/boston-marathon_b_3082551.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Read about our experience in 2013</a>, the year of the tragic bombing.</p>

<p>Shelley-Anne Morris of Ottawa is a visually challenged triathlete whose life has been changed by the support she has received from Won With One. Here's what she has to say about what Won With One means to her:</p>
<p><i>In the past four years, I have grown and developed both as an athlete and as a person. I’ve pushed myself physically. I’ve conquered 15 sprint distance/early bird tris and now hope to go on to participate in an Olympic distance in 2015. I’ve learned a lot about working as an athlete/guide team: one brain, two bodies. Triathlon takes logistical and organizational skill. I’ve learned a lot about preparing for the sport from my teammates. I’ve grown in confidence as a writer and as a communicator. That new-found confidence has led me to become a co-host on a disabilities radio show on one of Ottawa’s community radio shows.</i></p>
<p><i>When I am wearing my team uniform, I am standing proud, knowing that despite all the harshness and misconceptions that the world can dish out, my team has got my back. When we all show up en masse we take a definitive stance against discrimination, stereotype and the backward thinking that still holds many of us back from achieving our potential.  </i></p>
<p><i>Won With One has introduced me to some incredible people, each of whom has a story to tell. Athlete and guide alike, each and every one of us has a reason for being here. Many of my fellow teammates have lost vision and have had to re-define themselves within a ‘new normal.’ For some, vision loss meant a loss of employment and/or the need to ‘give up’ much-loved activities. Some never even considered becoming a triathlete until the opportunity presented itself.</i></p>
<p><i>All athletes have said that being part of the Won with One triathlon team has been ‘life-changing.’ Along with being a fitter, faster 52-year-old, I am doing things that once were out of my realm of possibilities. Being able to say “I’m a triathlete” has given me an incredible confidence boost. In 2013, I ran my first half-marathon!</i></p>
<p><i>Thank you for helping to change the lives of visually and physically challenged athletes who want nothing more than the chance to stand at the start line and test their limits.</i></p>

<p>The benefits of bamboo fibers and viscose in clothing is the natural ability to wick moisture away from your skin to help keep you cool and dry. Bamboo has natural antibacterial properties which helps prevent the growth of odour causing bacteria in your clothes. Combat sweat. Eliminate stank. Less washing. Less wear and tear. Bamboo fabrics do not retain odours well, and do not stain easily. That's longer lasting clothes. Period.</p>

<p><b>SUSTAINABILITY</b><br/>We manufacture some of our goods in Canada, USA, Mexico, China, India, and Indonesia. To help our economy, we can limit the carbon footprint caused by transportation of goods by delivering our products directly from our eCommerce and have our products made to order to limit the amount of needless overconsumption of products. Our definition of sustainability is not defined as being dependent on any one single source. In fact, we believe the definition of sustainability comes from collectively working together in a diverse global economy. The people involved with the sustainability movement are typically grassroots and often there is no incentive from governments, politics or media. We are working on changing this issue, and that's why you should invest in our campaign to raise funds. Plus, you're get some cool new sustainable product too!<br/>
<br/><b>HIGHLY RENEWABLE</b><br/>
In order for us to ensure that products are eco-friendly we need to focus our attention to the ingredients and the raw materials used to produce the products. This is the first and most important step in sustainability. In our case, our material source is bamboo.<br/><br/>Unlike the cotton industry that uses 40-50 different chemicals to grow and maintain their crops, bamboo uses none. That's right. Bamboo grows wild and naturally without the use of chemicals. Bamboo grows up to 4ft a day and over 100ft tall. It has no known pests or fungus. It's ultimate super plant!</p>

<p><b>SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE</b><br/>Founder and CEO, Justin Jack Bear has personally been doing independent research, with a study of bamboo products and the industry for the past 6 years. Justin has made successful business relationships with some of the most trusted bamboo brands in the North America and has been working together to bring the most socially responsible and eco-friendly products to market. We will offer the easiest and most convenient way to shop all the best bamboo made products. Right at your fingertips. Shipped worldwide, and directly to your door.</p>

BENEFITS OF BAMBOO

The benefits of bamboo fibers and viscose in clothing is the natural ability to wick moisture away from your skin to help keep you cool and dry. Bamboo has natural antibacterial properties which helps prevent the growth of odour causing bacteria in your clothes. Combat sweat. Eliminate stank. Less washing. Less wear and tear. Bamboo fabrics do not retain odours well, and do not stain easily. That's longer lasting clothes. Period.

<h3>Introduction</h3></span></h3>
<h4>The main products;<br/>1. The Mini F1-driver<br/>
</h4>
<p>A Mini F1-driver is a 3d-printed (stand-alone) miniature/figurine.<br/>It's printed in a material called ""full color Sandstone"" You can compare it with plaster. When it's printed, it is injected with a binder and ink at the same time. The walls are 2mm thick (minimum print-thickness). It's a static object, for display purpose only (it's not a toy!) Printed in 3d, and hand-finished.<br/><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1194109/files/20150203130548-Banner_CrF.jpg?1422997548"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>

<h4>2. The Mini F1-car</h4>
<p>The car is also printed in full color Sandstone. On average, the walls are 2mm thick. Some parts, like the wing-beams, are slightly thicker. They must be able to bare a small load. When it's being printed, the material is soft (like wet sand). It's left to dry for a few hours, before they can take it out of the print-tray. The tray is full of ""plaster""-powder, which has to be removed manually afterwards. At this stage, the material is at its most vulnerable point. When it's cleaned, an extra coat of varnish is applied to the model to make it much stronger. It also makes the colors even more vibrant. Because the minimum thickness is 2mm, I chose to make some other parts in other materials. The supports for head and steering-wheel are printed in a material called ""strong and flexible plastic"". In this case, the black version, because it looks best! The minimum wall thickness for this material is 0.7mm. <br/>The rim-material is called ""metallic plastic"" and has actual metallic powder mixed into it. The minimum thickness for this material is 0.8mm. By using this material, the rims can be very detailed, which otherwise would not be possible if printed in full color sandstone. It looks much better this way.<br/><br/>A full set comes with the main car-body, a matching head/helmet, steering-wheel, plastic supports and 4 metallic-plastic rims. The rims are snap-ons. The head and steering-wheel can rotate.<br/><br/></p>

They're not toys. You can use them to make pictures (great for social media), or enjoy just looking at it. <br/>It's a collectible piece of art.<br/><br/><h4>The designer / about me;</h4>
<p>My name is Alex van Ophuizen, and I'm a 3d-designer from Holland.<br/>I have been working in graphics-related businesses throughout my career. I'm <br/>36 years old, and have a lot of experience when it comes to design and related programs, like Photoshop, Illustrator and Indesign. I'm also a certified Avery-Graphics car-wrapper, with a passion for logo's and branding in general. <br/><br/>Somewhere in 2005, I had my first encounter with a 3d-program (Sketchup). Hooked ever-since! These days, I'm working with Blender3d. My biggest passion of-course, is F1. I started following the sport in 1994. Senna's last races, and Michael Schumacher's first, that's where it all started for me. Never ever missed a race from that moment.<br/></p>
<h4>The Concept;<br/>
</h4>
<p>Mini F1-drivers 2015 will be available in all of the F1-livery's. They want to connect with every F1-fan. The designs are made in a way that they are 3d-printable. Not just for rendering and animation! <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">You're able to buy one, and make your own fan-content. <br/>Like pictures for social media for example. </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">It's fun, and you can share it!</span></p>

<h3>What I need &amp; what you'll get<br/>
</h3>
<h4>I need: money to buy an F1-license<br/>
</h4>I've talked to an F1-team, and there is a way of making the Mini's with official livery. One of the key-points to make this happen; I have to pay royalties <i>in advance</i>. <br/>This to secure the teams interests and business-goals.<br/>In my case, they've asked for 100K. That is why my Mini's are inviting you to become part of this dream, this awesome project! Together, we can make this work.<br/>When they become official merchandise, the team will promote and sell them. <br/><span style=""background-color: initial;"">This will be a huge boost for Mini F1-drivers.</span>
</div><div>
<p></p>
<h4><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">What you will get in return;</span></span></h4>Make a pledge to this project, and you will get special Mini's, Mini-cars and other products in return. Become a part of the #MiniFamily! The Mini F1-drivers will share all their plans with you. Stuff that other fans will not be able to see. It's also an unique chance to have a special Mini-figure or Mini-car of your own, with your name or logo on it, or maybe a whole unique model of your own design.<br/><br/><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">Challenges and Risks</span><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></p>
</div><div> <p>The main challenge is to reach enough people in order to get the royalty-payment in place. If the Mini's don't reach enough people, they will never be official team merchandise. The only risk that applies to you; having a Mini without official logo's. But they would still look like the official livery though! The project is based on flexible funding, so whatever happens, you will get your Mini F1-driver or Mini F1-car.<br/></p>
<p><br/>Production-wise, there is no risk. Shapeways can handle very large orders.<br/>They are delivered by UPS. Logistically, there are no obstacles. World-wide shipping.<br/>For you it's a chance to get them cheaper than when you order them in my shop. For example, the pledged Mini F1-driver will come to you for $25,- <i>including shipping</i>.

</div></div>","Introduction
The main products;1. The Mini F1-driver

A Mini F1-driver is a 3d-printed (stand-alone) miniature/figurine.It's printed in a material called ""full color Sandstone"" You can compare it with plaster. When it's printed, it is injected with a binder and ink at the same time. The walls are 2mm thick (minimum print-thickness). It's a static object, for display purpose only (it's not a toy!) Printed in 3d, and hand-finished.



2. The Mini F1-car
The car is also printed in full color Sandstone. On average, the walls are 2mm thick. Some parts, like the wing-beams, are slightly thicker. They must be able to bare a small load. When it's being printed, the material is soft (like wet sand). It's left to dry for a few hours, before they can take it out of the print-tray. The tray is full of ""plaster""-powder, which has to be removed manually afterwards. At this stage, the material is at its most vulnerable point. When it's cleaned, an extra coat of varnish is applied to the model to make it much stronger. It also makes the colors even more vibrant. Because the minimum thickness is 2mm, I chose to make some other parts in other materials. The supports for head and steering-wheel are printed in a material called ""strong and flexible plastic"". In this case, the black version, because it looks best! The minimum wall thickness for this material is 0.7mm. The rim-material is called ""metallic plastic"" and has actual metallic powder mixed into it. The minimum thickness for this material is 0.8mm. By using this material, the rims can be very detailed, which otherwise would not be possible if printed in full color sandstone. It looks much better this way.A full set comes with the main car-body, a matching head/helmet, steering-wheel, plastic supports and 4 metallic-plastic rims. The rims are snap-ons. The head and steering-wheel can rotate.



* The car and minif1driver are meant as display-models only. They're not toys. You can use them to make pictures (great for social media), or enjoy just looking at it. It's a collectible piece of art.The designer / about me;
My name is Alex van Ophuizen, and I'm a 3d-designer from Holland.I have been working in graphics-related businesses throughout my career. I'm 36 years old, and have a lot of experience when it comes to design and related programs, like Photoshop, Illustrator and Indesign. I'm also a certified Avery-Graphics car-wrapper, with a passion for logo's and branding in general. Somewhere in 2005, I had my first encounter with a 3d-program (Sketchup). Hooked ever-since! These days, I'm working with Blender3d. My biggest passion of-course, is F1. I started following the sport in 1994. Senna's last races, and Michael Schumacher's first, that's where it all started for me. Never ever missed a race from that moment.
The Concept;

Mini F1-drivers 2015 will be available in all of the F1-livery's. They want to connect with every F1-fan. The designs are made in a way that they are 3d-printable. Not just for rendering and animation! You're able to buy one, and make your own fan-content. Like pictures for social media for example. It's fun, and you can share it!


What I need & what you'll get

I need: money to buy an F1-license
I've talked to an F1-team, and there is a way of making the Mini's with official livery. One of the key-points to make this happen; I have to pay royalties in advance. This to secure the teams interests and business-goals.In my case, they've asked for 100K. That is why my Mini's are inviting you to become part of this dream, this awesome project! Together, we can make this work.When they become official merchandise, the team will promote and sell them. This will be a huge boost for Mini F1-drivers.


What you will get in return;Make a pledge to this project, and you will get special Mini's, Mini-cars and other products in return. Become a part of the #MiniFamily! The Mini F1-drivers will share all their plans with you. Stuff that other fans will not be able to see. It's also an unique chance to have a special Mini-figure or Mini-car of your own, with your name or logo on it, or maybe a whole unique model of your own design.Challenges and Risks
 The main challenge is to reach enough people in order to get the royalty-payment in place. If the Mini's don't reach enough people, they will never be official team merchandise. The only risk that applies to you; having a Mini without official logo's. But they would still look like the official livery though! The project is based on flexible funding, so whatever happens, you will get your Mini F1-driver or Mini F1-car.
Production-wise, there is no risk. Shapeways can handle very large orders.They are delivered by UPS. Logistically, there are no obstacles. World-wide shipping.For you it's a chance to get them cheaper than when you order them in my shop. For example, the pledged Mini F1-driver will come to you for $25,- including shipping. That will save you some costs.So get on board, order your Mini F1-driver today. You will get your 2015-livery model by the end of May 2015.
    More ways for you to help 
If you're not in a position to make a pledge, that doesn't mean you can't help: as i mentioned before, F1 has a massive audience, on TV and also on social media! I need your help to share my content and reach enough people. It's just as important as making a pledge.

<p>It is an online cryptocurrency wallet which supports multiple cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC), Dogecoin (DOGE) and others. It enables the management of different digital currencies in one personal account.</p>
<p>The <a href=""https://www.cryptonator.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">desktop version of Cryptonator</a> is already home to over 17 000 user accounts and has received thousands of positive reviews.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/3x7Rtj8.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>Why we are here?</h3>
<p>Because we believe that cryptocurrencies are shaping the future of money and payments. We want to make this innovative payment solution usable by as many people as possible. Today, however, cryptocurrencies are quite difficult for an ordinary consumer. It takes time to understand how they work and how one can start using them. We want to make managing cryptocurrency payments as easy as sending an email or text message, keeping it safe and secure at the same time.</p>
<p>Today the web version of Cryptonator is helping thousands of people send, receive and instantly exchange various cryptocurrencies in one personal account.</p>
<p>The ability to manage multiple types of digital currencies on a smartphone and send mobile payments on the go is another important step in bringing this breakthrough technology to even more people.</p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We need $25,000USD to complete the development of the Cryptonator App and to release it for both iOS and Android. It includes prototyping, UI design, coding, security research and testing. After the initial release it will also cover bug fixes where necessary.</p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>Aside from cool rewards (at the right side), you will get <b>an early access to an awesome multi-cryptocurrency mobile wallet with stunning functionality</b> (iPhone and Android alike)</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We have already released a simpler cryptocurrency Apps for <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cryptonator/id859201083"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">iPhone</a> and <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aev.cryptonator"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Android</a>. Both of them received positive reviews, and have a couple of thousands of downloads. The Android app even made it to the <a href=""http://www.androidauthority.com/best-cryptocurrency-apps-for-android-581192/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">10 best cryptocurrency apps for Android</a> as  per recent Androidauthority review, and the iPhone App hit <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/cryptonator-brings-exciting-cryptocurrency-app-052100046.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">finance.yahoo.com</a>. Generally speaking we have the knowledge and experience required to develop and deliver this app.</p>
<p><b>Time risks</b></p>
<p>Development of the server-side API and the authorization protocol is almost finished. Hiring additional developers and security researchers would allow us to release the fully functional app by the end of May 2015. While we do not expect these dates to change, it is possible that the estimated release date may shift due to unexpected difficulties in development.</p>
<p><b>Cryptocurrency ban risks</b></p>

</h3></div>","What is Cryptonator?
It is an online cryptocurrency wallet which supports multiple cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC), Dogecoin (DOGE) and others. It enables the management of different digital currencies in one personal account.
The desktop version of Cryptonator is already home to over 17 000 user accounts and has received thousands of positive reviews.

Why we are here?
Because we believe that cryptocurrencies are shaping the future of money and payments. We want to make this innovative payment solution usable by as many people as possible. Today, however, cryptocurrencies are quite difficult for an ordinary consumer. It takes time to understand how they work and how one can start using them. We want to make managing cryptocurrency payments as easy as sending an email or text message, keeping it safe and secure at the same time.
Today the web version of Cryptonator is helping thousands of people send, receive and instantly exchange various cryptocurrencies in one personal account.
The ability to manage multiple types of digital currencies on a smartphone and send mobile payments on the go is another important step in bringing this breakthrough technology to even more people.
What We Need
We need $25,000USD to complete the development of the Cryptonator App and to release it for both iOS and Android. It includes prototyping, UI design, coding, security research and testing. After the initial release it will also cover bug fixes where necessary.
What You Get
Aside from cool rewards (at the right side), you will get an early access to an awesome multi-cryptocurrency mobile wallet with stunning functionality (iPhone and Android alike)

Risks & Challenges
We have already released a simpler cryptocurrency Apps for iPhone and Android. Both of them received positive reviews, and have a couple of thousands of downloads. The Android app even made it to the 10 best cryptocurrency apps for Android as  per recent Androidauthority review, and the iPhone App hit finance.yahoo.com. Generally speaking we have the knowledge and experience required to develop and deliver this app.
Time risks
Development of the server-side API and the authorization protocol is almost finished. Hiring additional developers and security researchers would allow us to release the fully functional app by the end of May 2015. While we do not expect these dates to change, it is possible that the estimated release date may shift due to unexpected difficulties in development.
Cryptocurrency ban risks
Certain governments may ban cryptocurrencies for some reasons, which might make our app unavailable in these countries. Re-establishing new iTunes/Google Play account helps solving such problems.
Logistics ricks
Despite tracking numbers, sometimes post services fail to deliver due to a variety of reasons. In the unlikely case your parcel is lost, we will resend your Perk.

What would the App cost if I just wait for it to come out?
The App is free. Our supporters will have early access to the App, 2-4 weeks ahead of everybody else.

My name is Mark Johnson. I was born in Hackney, East London. I was born on February 12 1971.  Born premature it nearly cost me my sight. I was born with a rare condition that would see me in and out of hospital for many, many years to come. Many operations would follow. My last was when I was 30 years old. 

While the scars around my eyes are clear to see it is a constant reminder of what I went through and still going through but I have to thank God because I have my sight.

It is fair to say my early educational years suffered due to being in hospital but from an early age I enjoyed drawing and was very creative. My fashion life began in secondary school. I had one of three options to choose. Photography, athletics or fashion.

I spent three years in fashion college but as time went on I taught myself things and would go into clothes stores to see how the clothes was made.

Dallas, dynasty took me in the direction of evening dresses. My sister was a model and my mother went to the London college of fashion.

In the past my designs have been on the same catwalk as Christian Dior and Pacco Rabanne. I worked for Ralph Lauren and the USA Olympic team for the 2012 London games. In 2009 I was the only British designer to take part in Geneva fashion fair.

CAMPAIGN

My brand label is called the House of Esther.

It is every fashion designers dream to take part in  fashion show in New York and for some years I have tried to fulfill that dream but it never came to pass until now. 

A great opportunity has come up for me to show my collection at the world famous Plitzs New York city fashion week on February 19. It will feature designers from around the world and get a great deal of press attention and I want to show my finest collection.

Time is short but I have people that will help me make the patterns and clothes. For my evening and bridal wear I want to use the best quality fabrics. Some will come from an area in West London called Shepherds bush. This is the show of all shows, It's New York, The press will be at the show so I need to deliver the very best.

Press will want to feature the designers and so I want to do the very best and that's why your help is needed. Please help me buy the finest silks, satins, Ankara and trimmings.

BREAK DOWN

The money will go to buy fabrics and dress gowns and beads. The gowns will be travelling with me from London to New York.

I will need to buy: Duchess satin, Silk satin, Quality lining and netting. The finest trimmings and African textiles.

I will need to buy designer labels and dress gowns.

Duchess satin is probably the most common fabric used for bridal dress and because most of the clothes will be cut on the bias more metres/yards will be needed.

Some fabrics will have diamante beads hand sewn on them. The finest beads will come from the West end of London.
IF I DON'T REACH MY GOALI'm hoping I will and with your help it will happen.
THE IMPACT
You all can be apart of my success. When you see my designs in magazines and shops and on the Catwalk of New York you can say you helped. It means this British born designer's dream will come true and eventually I can help others with the same or  similar dream come true.RISKS & CHALLENGESMy work is of a high standard.

<p>Paloma &amp; Angostura is a Colombian Impact design company, Sustainable fashion for peace building.</p>
<p>We conceived Paloma &amp; Angostura with the core belief that
through action and empowerment, true change and sustainable peace is possible.  We believe in Impact through design and Counciousness through industry. This is why we work directly with suppliers that were former members of ilegal armed groups in Colombia. People who used to belong to FARC and the AUC and now are creating a new beginning, a life in peace. </p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">With the initial guidance of The Colombian Agency for Reintegration (ACR) we started working with Ederlidia Garizao, who used to make the AUC´s combat uniforms and now employs former combatants not only from the AUC but also from the FARC. In 2006, she </span>demobilized<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> from the paramilitaries, and returned to her hometown in Urabá; however, because of threats from criminal bands in the area, she had to move to Bogotá in search of a new beginning. Thanks to her discipline and hard work she managed to put together a small workshop where she employs women heads of household and other </span>demobilized<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> guerrillas and paramilitaries. Ederlidia aspires to grow into a great business that creates value for society and employment for people affected by the conflict. At Paloma &amp; Angostura, we want to help her </span>fulfill<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> that dream by rebuilding social fabric and promoting reconciliation.</span></span></p>
<p>Furthermore, In looking to fulfill our environmental values we sought to locally source in South America, organic Pima Cotton from Peru. There we met suppliers and found incredibly soft fabrics that make our products feel as good as the story they tell. </p>
<p>For us it has never been just about fashion, but rather to create products that tell a compelling local narrative that has global resonance because of its intrinsic values of peace, liberty and empowerment.</p>

</div><div> <p>We need financing to fulfil a few goals, Mainly to make the company sustainable, create new jobs and better the working conditions for the workers who already produce our products: </p> <ul> <li>We want to better the working condition of our suppliers. This is why we want to change Ederlidia's cutting table and sewing machine, this will mean that our products will have better quality and it will generate an impact in her workshop.</li>
<li>We want to be able to enter new markets, finish our website and find more sales channels this will allow us to increase our production and create new well paying jobs for former combatants</li>
<li>Peruvian organic pima cotton is expensive, and we want to continue to sell organic fibers to our clients. We want to explore new fabrics to include in our product range.</li>
<li>Development of new products: We seek to be a lifestyle brand and would like to look for new suppliers that are peace builders. However, product development and quality assurance is slow and we need financial backing to get products to market. Right now we are talking with government institutions in order to create products that help build post-conflict economy. </li>
<li> We would like to sell primarily in the United States, United Kingdom, Europe and Canada. Entering these markets is expensive because it means going to trade shows, finding buyers and retailers or finding people that will manage our marketing, order fulfilment and distribution. Shipping from Colombia is too expensive and would drive up the price of our products to final consumers, this is against our values as we would like to sell social, environmental and economic value.</li> </ul>

<li>We think that it is very powerful to create and sell products that are embedded with values of reconciliation and peace building. When people humanize and see those that are former enemies it is easier to forgive them.</li>
<li>We invest in our workers to better their working conditions</li>
<li>We use environmentally friendly textiles, Right now 70% of our cotton is Organic Pima Cotton  we want to increase this number to 100%<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435845900/rr7thzrnddz5ewthb9wv.jpg"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""/>

</div></div>","Paloma & Angostura:  Who we are



Paloma & Angostura is a Colombian Impact design company, Sustainable fashion for peace building.
We conceived Paloma & Angostura with the core belief that
through action and empowerment, true change and sustainable peace is possible.  We believe in Impact through design and Counciousness through industry. This is why we work directly with suppliers that were former members of ilegal armed groups in Colombia. People who used to belong to FARC and the AUC and now are creating a new beginning, a life in peace. 
With the initial guidance of The Colombian Agency for Reintegration (ACR) we started working with Ederlidia Garizao, who used to make the AUC´s combat uniforms and now employs former combatants not only from the AUC but also from the FARC. In 2006, she demobilized from the paramilitaries, and returned to her hometown in Urabá; however, because of threats from criminal bands in the area, she had to move to Bogotá in search of a new beginning. Thanks to her discipline and hard work she managed to put together a small workshop where she employs women heads of household and other demobilized guerrillas and paramilitaries. Ederlidia aspires to grow into a great business that creates value for society and employment for people affected by the conflict. At Paloma & Angostura, we want to help her fulfill that dream by rebuilding social fabric and promoting reconciliation.
Furthermore, In looking to fulfill our environmental values we sought to locally source in South America, organic Pima Cotton from Peru. There we met suppliers and found incredibly soft fabrics that make our products feel as good as the story they tell. 
For us it has never been just about fashion, but rather to create products that tell a compelling local narrative that has global resonance because of its intrinsic values of peace, liberty and empowerment.
Our Model




Media
Seen on CCTV America.

Other publications and recognition:

                      

Products
 




Environmentally Friendly Textiles

What We Need 
 We need financing to fulfil a few goals, Mainly to make the company sustainable, create new jobs and better the working conditions for the workers who already produce our products:   We want to better the working condition of our suppliers. This is why we want to change Ederlidia's cutting table and sewing machine, this will mean that our products will have better quality and it will generate an impact in her workshop.
We want to be able to enter new markets, finish our website and find more sales channels this will allow us to increase our production and create new well paying jobs for former combatants
Peruvian organic pima cotton is expensive, and we want to continue to sell organic fibers to our clients. We want to explore new fabrics to include in our product range.
Development of new products: We seek to be a lifestyle brand and would like to look for new suppliers that are peace builders. However, product development and quality assurance is slow and we need financial backing to get products to market. Right now we are talking with government institutions in order to create products that help build post-conflict economy. 
 We would like to sell primarily in the United States, United Kingdom, Europe and Canada. Entering these markets is expensive because it means going to trade shows, finding buyers and retailers or finding people that will manage our marketing, order fulfilment and distribution. Shipping from Colombia is too expensive and would drive up the price of our products to final consumers, this is against our values as we would like to sell social, environmental and economic value. 



   The Impact By joining this movement you are helping us empower a whole generation to build peace, we want to rebuild and reimagine a peaceful society and take away the discourse of peace from politicians and empower local grassroots communities to take helm of this peace-building effort :  We look for local narratives that resonate value and for products that go beyond their stitching
We think that it is very powerful to create and sell products that are embedded with values of reconciliation and peace building. When people humanize and see those that are former enemies it is easier to forgive them.
We invest in our workers to better their working conditions
We use environmentally friendly textiles, Right now 70% of our cotton is Organic Pima Cotton  we want to increase this number to 100%
    
Risks & Challenges There is some risk involved in the production process including times of delivery. Also the postage system is terribly slow and unreliable, but we will make our best effort to send you your reward as fast as possible.
