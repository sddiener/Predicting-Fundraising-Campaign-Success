a junior classical guitarist at Stetson University’s School of Music in Deland,
Fl. I have been playing classical guitar for over 5 years, and I’m now studying
under the famous Dr. Stephen Robinson. Classical Guitar is my passion, I live
and breathe under the soothing majesty of the repertoire I play daily, and
nothing in this world can make me a better human being than to relinquish my
heart and soul to the constant improvement and fulfillment of my career. Where does
my musical dream end? It does not. Even if one day my fingers shall go brittle
and weak, I will always do my best to communicate my musical message to everyone.
It is my deepest desire to take Classical guitar to the confines of the world.
To teach youth and elders to appreciate the beauty and peace found within the
limitless capabilities of my instrument. Unfortunately, every dreamer’s path
has obstacles. Mine has been just as anyone else’s, and I can’t be thankful
enough to those around me for sticking with me through thick and thin. However,
a one-in-a-lifetime career bending opportunity has come into said path. Recently,
Dr. Robinson has invited me and a couple of other guitarists, under his care,
to participate in the Sorrento Guitar Festival (a guitar workshop hosted in
Sorrento, Italy, from May 31<sup>st</sup> to June 4<sup>th</sup>, 2014). This
opportunity will not only serve us as an once-in-a-lifetime experience, but it
will also contribute immensely in our careers as a classical guitarists. The
estimated cost for this endeavor is $3,000.00. As many of you may know, being a
college student is very expensive. My family has always been my backbone,
holding me strongly to this path. Even so, a current financial crisis threatens
the completion of this important step in my career. Both my brother and father
lost their jobs recently, and although they now have found employment, it will
be impossible for them to cover the costs for this trip. I’m currently working
3 jobs outside of my full-time student schedule to cover my own college
expenses (rent, food, instrument maintenance, new equipment, etc.). Therefore, it
is out of my reach to save up for this part of my dream. I cannot ask you to
carry me through all that’s been put in front of me to accomplish what I wish.
All I wish is for your most sincere support. I really need help with this, and
I have spent all available resources around me. It would mean the world to me
if you can help in any small possible way. I promise you, I will not disappoint
your support. I will make the best out of this path I have chosen, and I will
always keep you all closest to my heart whenever I perform and share my hard work
with the world. Please, help me. Whether it’s $1.00 or $100.00, any donation
will be more than greatly appreciated. Even if you are unable to donate, you can still help by spreading the word in whichever way you can.

<h3>My Dream<br/>
</h3>
<p>Hi there, my name is Justin Yost and I am the sole member of The Secret Songs of Us. When I started eighth grade I had a dream to write and record a CD all by myself that was fun, energetic, positive, and very personal. Nine years later I still have that dream and with your help I might be able to finally make that dream a reality. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Why $4,500?<br/>
</h3>
<p>The music industry sucks. It's just that simple. Record labels give you a miniscule fraction of the money your music actually makes. They own and control everything. Merchandise is ridiculously expensive to print if you're the Average Joe. Studios with real producers who want to make unique records are even more expensive. So what can a dude like me, who's doing it all alone, possibly do? <br/></p>
<p>I looked everywhere, found the best folks in the industry with the most affordable prices possible, and crunched all the numbers together. $4,500 may seem like a lot, it may seem like chump change. However you view it, it's literally the very best I could find. My brilliant friend Greg Parker (Amped Recording) who recorded my first single, 31st and 9th, is willing to sit in a room with me for hours upon hours to help me make the CD of my dreams. He's going to produce, engineer, mix, and master the whole thing for $4,500. That's an absolute steal. As you can hear in 31st and 9th, the mix sounds awesome. He's excellent at what he does and I wouldn't want to be taking on this project with anyone else. <br/></p>
<p>The other money that will be required to print physical copies of the CD as well as pay for it to be distributed through online retailers like iTunes and Spotify I will handle. Printing high quality CD's, posters, shipping, and paying for distribution is a pretty expensive thing to do, but I couldn't imagine asking anyone for anymore help. Just please help me reach my goal of 4,500 and I'll take care of the rest! <br/></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<h3><b>What The Heck Do I Get For Donating?</b></h3>
<p>Look to the right hand side of the page and you can view all the perks I have for folks who donate. I'm REALLY excited to be able to offer unique incentives to friends instead of the boring, run of the mill things you see all the time. Incentives range from a mp3 download of my new song, 31st and 9th, all the way up to the signed snare drum I recorded the whole CD on! Definitely go check out the perks and see what you can afford and what excites you. Get pumped, this is a thrilling time for me. I can't wait to have you be apart of it with me!!<br/></p>
<h3>What Happens If I Don't Reach My Goal?</h3>
<p>Part of the beauty of Indiegogo is that you can choose to keep what you raise even when you don't meet your full goal. I'm truly hoping we can do that, but if we can't I will use what we have raised and simply record a shorter EP. Obviously I'd prefer to record a full length record for all of you because I truly believe I have ten songs that have the potential to really impact people. If I have to make an EP instead, I'll just pick my favorite four or five songs and release them! Either way, you'll receive music from me as well as whatever perk you were promised. Let's just reach the goal and we won't have to worry about any of that other stuff!<br/></p>
<p></p>

<h3>You Really Want To Help But Just Can't Afford It Right Now<br/>
</h3>
<p>Hey, look, some people just can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean you can’t help! Spread the word! Facebook, Twitter, Email, Instagram... all those social networking sites are great for this type of thing! Pass the word onto family and friends who may not have any of those things.

<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The Mission</span>
</h1>
<div>When I opened my repair shop I did so with the intent on making it a part of the community in Logan Square.  I wanted to show people that helping the artist down the street is an investment in who we are as a community.  I wanted to have a store that hopefully showcased the real value of art when we put our hearts into it. I believe that my store is on a wonderful path of becoming just that. Whether or not you are a musician we can all share the power music has on our emotions. </div>
<div>This year we are taking Caton Guitars to Luthier conventions.   We want to show that our instruments stand with the best built instruments in the world.  Caton Guitars have a clean design, amazing comfort and exquisite sound.  It is time for me to take my guitars to the next level and share my design and expertise with the world.  Your funding will help secure our spots at conventions, purchasing a few pieces of equipment and keep my store open with a part-time employee, while I attend these shows.  My guitars are made to order and are built entirely by hand with the aid of temples and fixtures, each made entirely by me.  There is no CNC or other  milling involved. Every process on every Caton Guitar is done by me and me only.  Therefore, I also intend on building a few more fixtures that will help reduce the time it takes to build my guitars while not compromising on quality.  Each fixture takes it's own time to build and has costs involved (building materials, routers, cutting bits, etc.)<p></p>

Hello Everyone! 
My name is Kevin Caton and I am a Luthier in Chicago. 



I build hand crafted acoustic guitars. I am the owner and operator of Caton Guitars and an instrument repair shop.  I have a passion for art and music and have always considered myself an artist.  My grandfather gave me my first guitar when I was 17 and I quickly became fascinated by the way it was built.  

                                                (My Grandpa)                                         (Me with one of my guitars)  By the time I was 19 I had built my first guitar.  As soon as I strummed a chord on that guitar, I knew I had to build more!
 I attended the Roberto-Venn School of Luthiery in Phoenix, Arizona when I was 26 and have now been handcrafting guitars for nearly 20 years.  For the past 10 years I have been a full time professional Luthier.  Most of my guitars are crafted to order. 
First, I begin by talking with my clients to build a guitar that is truly ""theirs"". Listening and understanding his or her spirit and musicianship helps ensure my made to order mission.  That personal connection drives what wood we select, its grain, its sound, its finish. Blending the musicians personal passion with my passion to craft the perfect guitar makes for an amazing instrument. There is a bonding that takes place between myself and the instrument.  At times it is almost like the wood is telling me what it wants to become.  

      I will spend hours sorting through wood until I find that one piece that speaks to the partnership I've built with my client.  I  will find that one piece that has the perfect grain, the perfect weight and the perfect colors.  It's almost like the world grows a few trees with the purpose of it becoming an instrument.  There is no comparison of a factory built guitar to a handmade personally crafted instrument.  When a guitar is made with emotion and love, it comes through in the sound and creates a bond between the player and the instrument. Your contributions to Caton Guitars will help support my genuine desire to craft guitars to life and keep the dying art of luthiery alive. It will help me build guitars for musicians to inspire them to write songs that would have otherwise never been played. 

             


The Mission

When I opened my repair shop I did so with the intent on making it a part of the community in Logan Square.  I wanted to show people that helping the artist down the street is an investment in who we are as a community.  I wanted to have a store that hopefully showcased the real value of art when we put our hearts into it. I believe that my store is on a wonderful path of becoming just that. Whether or not you are a musician we can all share the power music has on our emotions. 
This year we are taking Caton Guitars to Luthier conventions.   We want to show that our instruments stand with the best built instruments in the world.  Caton Guitars have a clean design, amazing comfort and exquisite sound.  It is time for me to take my guitars to the next level and share my design and expertise with the world.  Your funding will help secure our spots at conventions, purchasing a few pieces of equipment and keep my store open with a part-time employee, while I attend these shows.  My guitars are made to order and are built entirely by hand with the aid of temples and fixtures, each made entirely by me.  There is no CNC or other  milling involved. Every process on every Caton Guitar is done by me and me only.  Therefore, I also intend on building a few more fixtures that will help reduce the time it takes to build my guitars while not compromising on quality.  Each fixture takes it's own time to build and has costs involved (building materials, routers, cutting bits, etc.)


 
     



Caton Guitars are NOT just Guitars
These days you can purchase almost everything in a ""Big Box"" store.  You can buy anything from pottery to tables or even mass produced paintings.  Guitars have not escaped this.  
Ask yourself, ""what has more value or what has more ""life"", a pot that was mass produced, or a hand spun, hand glazed, hand fired pot with as many unique qualities as the person who made it?"" 
My guitars are meant to be played and last more than a life time, hopefully a few lifetimes.  When you contribute to this campaign, imagine this.  You could go listen to music being played on my guitar this week and it may not change your life, but that guitar will change the life of the player.  At some point, that guitar will be passed to another player and change their life,  and then passed to another and then another.

</p><h2><b>Short Summary</b></h2>
<p>I am raising funds for the recording and production of my composition EXO/ENDO. This is the culmination of a long commitment to sonic expression, an ongoing experimentation with voice and technology and an education that has taken me across Canada, Europe and The United States. This composition features all my work with voice and electronics created in the Kyma sound design environment from Symbolic Sound.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have completed a Doctorate of Musical Arts from the California Institute of the Arts where I researched vocal feature extraction, enabling voice-controlled electronics, and experimented with the performative and compositional applications of this practice. My research has been published in the Leonardo Music Journal in 2014 and I have been performing internationally at Espace Senghor in Belgium, The Emily Harvey Foundation in New York, Splendor in Amsterdam, Ex Stock Exchange in Athens, Open Space Gallery in Victoria, La Sala Rosa in Montreal, the Casino Baumgarten in Vienna, Het Muziekgebouw aan ‘T IJ in Amsterdam, ZKM Centre for Art and Media in Karlsruhe, Germany, and at REDCAT (Roy and Edna Disney/CalArts Theatre), Los Angeles.<b> Now it is time to share the culmination of my life’s work with audiences in Canada!</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have received enthusiastic reviews from professional music organizations as the ensemble prepares to take EXO/ENDO on tour in Canada, November 2016. The recording and production of this work will enable me to share this music with people and allow you all to take it home and listen to it on your own terms. My music is a result of truly unique people combining their inventions and will inspire people to be inclusive, group-oriented and creative people. </p>

I am raising funds for the recording and production of my composition EXO/ENDO. This is the culmination of a long commitment to sonic expression, an ongoing experimentation with voice and technology and an education that has taken me across Canada, Europe and The United States. This composition features all my work with voice and electronics created in the Kyma sound design environment from Symbolic Sound.

I have completed a Doctorate of Musical Arts from the California Institute of the Arts where I researched vocal feature extraction, enabling voice-controlled electronics, and experimented with the performative and compositional applications of this practice. My research has been published in the Leonardo Music Journal in 2014 and I have been performing internationally at Espace Senghor in Belgium, The Emily Harvey Foundation in New York, Splendor in Amsterdam, Ex Stock Exchange in Athens, Open Space Gallery in Victoria, La Sala Rosa in Montreal, the Casino Baumgarten in Vienna, Het Muziekgebouw aan ‘T IJ in Amsterdam, ZKM Centre for Art and Media in Karlsruhe, Germany, and at REDCAT (Roy and Edna Disney/CalArts Theatre), Los Angeles. Now it is time to share the culmination of my life’s work with audiences in Canada!

I have received enthusiastic reviews from professional music organizations as the ensemble prepares to take EXO/ENDO on tour in Canada, November 2016. The recording and production of this work will enable me to share this music with people and allow you all to take it home and listen to it on your own terms. My music is a result of truly unique people combining their inventions and will inspire people to be inclusive, group-oriented and creative people.

We are ALMOST KINGS, an independent and
do-it-yourself rock/hip-hop band from Atlanta, GA.  Over the last 6 years,
we have toured the U.S. without record label support, going town to town and
building a family of fans one show at a time.  Today, we have found
ourselves at a critical crossroads in our career.  We have never
put out a truly ""high quality"" and professionally-produced album that
also captures the high energy that we give to our fans live. To be completely
honest, it is because we, as an independent band, have never been able to
afford it.  The truth is that, in order to keep moving forward in this
evolving music business, we have the dire need for an
""industry-standard"" high-quality album.     If you know us,
then you know that we can barely afford to feed ourselves after expenses (gas,
insurance, vehicle repairs & maintenance, instrument upkeep & repairs,
management & agent commissions, merch costs, etc.) are paid for.  We
LOVE what we do, and genuinely LOVE our family of fans that allows us to stay
on the road and positively affect lives through music. This campaign is set up
to involve our fans with the funding of this new Almost Kings album.  It's
time we give YOU a high-caliber record and with your support, not even the sky
is the limit. 
What We Need & What You Get
The truth is that, in the past, we have cut
corners to cut costs while doing our albums and it shows.  It is time for
us to do this the right way and give YOU a product that, collectively, we can
all be proud of.  We don't want any ambiguity as to where your money is
going, so lets be very clear:   APPROXIMATE COSTS:

for everybody, so we have put our heads together and come up some perks for
contributors.  We are offering pre-show cookouts with us, tickets to a VIP
listening party in ATL before the album's release, a ""golden ticket""

that want to be involved.  Whether we reach our goal or not, each penny
will be spent towards making the best possible album, marketing and promoting
it, and making damn sure that we make our family of fans proud!


The Impact

<p>Hi, I'm Julian Rymar! For those who don't know me, I've played clarinet for 8 years now. I'm 17 years old, currently a senior in high school at Orange County School of the Arts in Santa Ana, CA. I've spent most of my life studying music so I can make a profession out of it. Recently, I've been traveling to audition for many of the major conservatories across the US in hopes of attending a great school in the fall. </p><p>For an aspiring musician, continuing to study throughout the summer is extremely important; it's a time to focus and practice with few distractions. Attending a summer program puts me in a situation where I only have to worry about music and nothing else. </p><p>Kinhaven Music School<span style=""background-color: initial;""> is where I want to go this summer to study. It's a 6 week program that takes place on their campus in beautiful Weston, Vermont.

</div></div>","Hello!
Hi, I'm Julian Rymar! For those who don't know me, I've played clarinet for 8 years now. I'm 17 years old, currently a senior in high school at Orange County School of the Arts in Santa Ana, CA. I've spent most of my life studying music so I can make a profession out of it. Recently, I've been traveling to audition for many of the major conservatories across the US in hopes of attending a great school in the fall. For an aspiring musician, continuing to study throughout the summer is extremely important; it's a time to focus and practice with few distractions. Attending a summer program puts me in a situation where I only have to worry about music and nothing else. Kinhaven Music School is where I want to go this summer to study. It's a 6 week program that takes place on their campus in beautiful Weston, Vermont. I'd receive twice weekly lessons, twice daily chamber coaching, and daily orchestral rehearsals resulting in weekly concerts. I get the chance to work with amazing teachers and conductors alongside talented and bright students, like myself. All of this profound musical training is paired with a traditional camp experience filled with activities, trips, and time to unwind and rest. Having attended Kinhaven last summer, there was no doubt in my mind that I was going to return this next summer. I have never been happier or more at peace than I was during those 6 weeks at Kinhaven last summer. Not only was I receiving focused musical training, but I got the experience to be part of a tightly knit community that cared for everyone else within. There are so many things unique to the Kinhaven experience that contribute to it being so impactful.  Singing madrigals together, learning folk dances together, and other traditions like eating face-sized cookies after staff concerts, competing in the Regatta boat races, and praising Wally Wampus among many other memorable experiences. There's truly nothing else like Kinhaven.

<h3>My music, my life...<br/>
</h3>Hello, my name is Ricardo Barrantes and I am from Costa Rica. I am a 19-year old violin player studying in the Saint Petersburg Conservatory in Russia, thanks to the help of a scholarship I won last year. I've been studying music for almost 8 years and I can tell that it means everything to me, it makes my life full of emotions and passion. Thanks to the music I've done things I never thought I would do, like being in a music camp along other 130 young people who share the same love and passion for music like me, travel to several countries like Mexico, Uruguay, Nicaragua and El Salvador with this and other people to have wonderful experiences playing together, meeting great people, and last but not least, bringing me to a conservatory that has hosted many incredible musicians and composers. It feels great to know that you are in the same building that was Tchaikovsky and violinists like Jascha Heifetz and Nathan Milstein.<br/><br/><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""435"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FItnqm7yCZ3o%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DItnqm7yCZ3o&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FItnqm7yCZ3o%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/>This is the orchestra I played with back in Costa Rica, the Manuel Maria Gutierrez National Orchestra, when we were in Mexico in the Nezahualcoyotl Concert Hall, one of the most important concert halls in Mexico.

</div> <div> <h3>As a violinist I need indeed... a violin</h3>Not everyone may know this, but real handmade violins are very expensive, and I, as a student, cannot afford a $20000 violin, nor my parents in Costa Rica. In my house only my father works and he needs to sustain a five people family, pay for the university of my older brother and the school of my younger brother. My teacher in Costa Rica made me the big favor of lending me one of his personal violins in order to come here with an instrument, for I don't have a violin of my own. Not long ago I had to go to a violin maker and repairer because this violin has some issues, and he told me that I was urged to get a new instrument because this violin's construction is not correct and that if I continued playing in this instrument I could harm severely my technique, so since then I am trying by any means to get the money for a new violin. So my goal here in Indiegogo is to search for some help to reach the goal of $20000 so I could buy an instrument of my own. If by bad luck I don't reach the goal any help would come handy since I wouldn't need to gather all the money by myself.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1088445/files/20141211010330-foto6.jpg?1418288610"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>Last year was marked by some difficult losses for me, and lots of personal growth.  I've been learning to let go in new ways, and ""the Letting Go"" is part of the fruit of this season in my life.  Even in launching this campaign I'm letting go of doing things on my own, and I'm letting go of doing things perfectly.  You coming alongside would make the journey SO much sweeter.  <b>Will you?</b></p>

<p>As a small token of my love and affection for your help in bringing this music to the world I'm offering some pretty sweet perks!  In addition to the standard fare, may I draw your attention to a personal song or a house concert?  I would love to serenade you or write a song about something random like thermal underwear.</p>
<p>This is a flexible funding campaign, and all funds will go toward recording ""the Letting Go"" even if the goal is not met.  My minimum need for this project is $1,500 (I'll cut out CD duplication and some graphic design), and if we don't even make it that far I'll still continue on but with a limited (and much delayed) release.</p>

<p>There are also some more reasonable fears and risks surrounding the recording process, but I navigated these before when creating my first album ""The Coming &amp; the Leaving"".  As I shared above, if funding falls short I still have about half the funds for the overall budget and will continue on with a much more limited release.</p>
<p>I'm planning to work with many of the same people who helped make ""The Coming &amp; the Leaving"" a reality, including my producer Malachi Jaggers.  Malachi is incredibly talented and has many successful albums to his credit.</p>

<p>We are self releasing Eternal Embrace independantly. This has its benefits and its draw backs. The benefits are that we have total control.

We have total freedom to play the shows we like, look how we like, write how we like and sound how we like. The drawbacks are that there is no major cash injection to push an album or a tour.

</div></div>","The Best Days After leaving New York City this past summer, an energy medicine healer sent us to a mountain cabin in the forest outside of Brevard, North Carolina. We did not have the intention of producing a new album but songs started appearing like visions out of the woodwork, and the music began to take on a life of its own.  The first song we wrote was 'The Best Days' followed by 'A Million Words of Love' 'OM Shiva' ' Just Believe' and 'The War is Over'.  These are organic love songs - the love of life, the love of music, the love of nature, the love of spirit.  
By contributing to The Best Days, you not only receive an advance copy of the music, you are also helping us to complete production, print CDs, and spread the word of the music to the world. All contributors will receive a free download of the new album before it's official release in February 2015!
We have completed the first single and video for  'The Best Days'. Click here for a free download!

    The Impact With our new album 'A Million Words of Love' we seek to spread a positive, peaceful vibration through music.  By contributing to our campaign you are helping us to spread a positive message of universal love, and you are directly supporting us as independent artists.

<p>Sue has been a performing songwriter for over 30 years, Rusty
Nelson has been writing for a couple of decades.  We
teamed up to write together and right away knew we had something special. Now
we have just finished our first duo recording. We love the songs on this EP and
are excited about sharing them with you and everyone else out there.</p>
<p>Bradley Kopp has done an exquisite job of engineering,
producing and mixing the project.  He
also delivered incredible lead guitar, dobro, backing vocals and he played bass.  Richard Bowden played wonderful fiddle on 3
tracks.  And Chip Dolan offered the
perfect accordion accompaniment on a song Rusty wrote for his Dad, “Where the
Ferry Boat Used to Run.”  </p>
<p>The songs have been recorded, mixed and mastered.  All that remains is the package design and
manufacture of the finished CDs.  This is
where you come in.  We are hoping to
raise the last $2200 among those of you that have been so supportive of our
musical adventure together.  </p>
<p>The title song of the EP is “Back Road Love,” and offers a
strong anchor for the other songs.  Back
Road evokes a desire for something deeper and more authentic in our lives.  We hope that these songs will inspire you as
you travel your own road and deepen your journey.  </p>
<p>We have some great rewards in exchange for your support,
like EPs, autographed posters, lyric sheets, serenades, a co-write or a custom
song, a private concert and more. The most off the wall is a back road route
that Rusty will create for you between any two points in Austin.  That’s right Back Road is a state of mind…and
great back roads can be found in the middle of Austin!  </p>
<p>If we exceed our goal of $2200, any additional funds that we
raise will be used to promote the EP – to get it into the hands of radio hosts
and music reviewers and reach even more people. It’s all about spreading that
Back Road Love.</p>

<h3><span style=""color: #ff0080;"">Help Bring The Mad Violinist &amp; Symphony Crack Orchestra to You! </span></h3>
<p>The Symphony Crack Orchestra invites you to be a part of the special moments they have been fortunate to have. They are debuting their sophomore album Fiend on the first-ever fan-funded tour this coming spring in a crowd-funding initiative. Symphony Crack has taken to their fans and supporters to be an integral part of the process and learn firsthand what it takes to produce a music album release tour of this caliber.</p>
<p>“Often times, I have fans asking me how they can break into the music business or how they can learn more about production from behind the scenes. I think this campaign is a great way to provide my fans a behind-the-scenes experience on how a tour is planned, developed, and performed,” said the group’s leader, Ashanti Floyd aka The Mad Violinist.</p>
<h3><span style=""color: #ff0000;"">About The Campaign</span></h3>
<p>The Symphony Crack Orchestra, the 7-Time Grammy Nominated unconventional group with eclectic musical has launched an IndieGoGo effort to raise $50,000 to crowd fund their first “The Fiend Tour” planned for venues in Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Florida, Alabama and Tennessee. Eventually to include Louisiana, Virginia, Mississippi, Kentucky and West Virginia. Funding goes to support travel, lodging, equipment costs, and other miscellaneous costs that tend to arise.</p>
<p>The Mad Violinist &amp; Symphony Crack Orchestra recently announced the release of their sophomore music album, 'Fiend,' and <span style=""color: #0080c0;""><strong>within 24 hours, 'Fiend' climbed from Top 200 to <span style=""color: #ff0000;"">Top 10 on iTunes</span></strong></span>. By using crowd funding to help support and promote these talented artists, it enables them to push the boundaries of music once again to inspire others to innovate alongside them. If the campaign is successful, it will allow Symphony Crack to pursue more tours across the nation, and eventually the globe.</p>
<p>“Symphony Crack’s new album, Fiend, pushes the limits of music. Fusing sounds like electronic, classical, and RnB, they are taking music to where no one has before.” –Award Winning Producer, Kane Beatz</p>
<p>The group has a strong musical pedigree including, Matt Barrett on guitar, Chris Morgan on keys, Mike Belluso playing Bass, Casey Crogan on Drums, Lance Powlis with the Horns, and Adrian Crutchfield on the Saxophone. Find out more by visiting symphonycrack.com</p>

<h3><span style=""color: #0000ff;"">About the Band</span></h3>
<p>The Symphony Crack Orchestra brings an incredible amount of passion into the creation of their music in the studio, which extends to their live performances, effectively making their shows an entirely new and unique experience.

They recently launched a partnership with Maker Studios to enhance the user experience of their YouTube channel after realizing the quick success of The Mad Violinist freestyle remake of Ellie Goulding's ""Lights.""</p>
<p>Ashanti Floyd, known as The Mad Violinist, is one of the top violinists, string arrangers, and performers in the country. He picked up his first violin at the age of three with strong inspiration from his mother. Floyd is now musically accomplished in over thirty instruments. He has performed live with B.B. King. He also tours with Lupe Fiasco. Floyd has performed at the BET Awards, MTV Video Music Awards, and on BET’s 106 &amp; Park.</p>
<p>Saxophonist Adrian Crutchfield of Charlotte, North Carolina was first introduced to his instrument at the age of four when Kenny G noticed Adrian's interest from the audience during a live show. Kenny G stopped the show and invited Adrian on stage, where he proceeded to play a brief pedagogical melody and then handed Adrian his first sax. Adrian has performed with some of today's brightest stars such as Lionel Richie, Jill Scott, Anthony Hamilton, Fantasia Barinno, KC and JoJo, Adina Howard, Regina Belle, and Young Jeezy.</p>
<p>Casey Crogan of Portland, Oregon attributes playing air drums to the tunes of David Bowie as a child as the start to a career that led him to Symphony Crack. Michael Belluso and Chris Morgan are both very talented and versatile musicians in their craft. While growing up in Atlanta, Georgia Michael inherited an interest in music from his father, who plays the piano and guitar. At the age of 12 he began playing the guitar and music has since been his passion. He is also accomplished with the guitar, bass, drums and piano. Chris performs as DJ, keyboard player and percussionist.</p>

<p>Hello and thanks for taking time to view our campaign! We need your help and we hope crowd funding is the answer! We are raising money to open an arcade and live music venue in our home town of Muskegon, MI. Our city used to be very prominent. It was a place filled with character and entertainment; a place for tourists to come and enjoy. Over the years however it has been rough. Through the recent recession buildings were torn down left and right.  This eliminated places for startup businesses and diminished our city’s history and its character.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align=""center""><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Our Vision</span></strong></p>
<p>So this leads us to our idea!  We never got the chance to enjoy the fun of an arcade here in Muskegon. We always hear people complaining about how there’s nothing interesting to do here and how they have to travel to nearby cities to have a good time.  Being in Michigan we have a lot to do in the summer, but our city really lacks winter fun. Sure you can go to the Movie Theater or bowling alley, but how often can you do that before it gets boring?</p>
<p>You may be wondering what our place is going to be like, right?  Nick &amp; Tim’s will be a distinguished arcade and drink house in the heart of Downtown Muskegon, MI, offering upper class drinks and entertainment at a middle class cost. Our unique combination of retro gaming and modern technology in our casual environment is sure to keep you, your friends and your family entertained for hours. Sit down and enjoy anything from major domestic beers, local brews or even one of our retro-game-themed concoctions as you play a game of Pac-Man and listen to some of Muskegon’s most talented musicians light up the stage. Our friendly and professional staff will be available for whatever you need, but may take the occasional break to attempt to beat your high score in Pinball! From a welcoming environment to hours of excitement, Nick &amp; Tim’s Arcade and Drink House will be filled with fun, laughter, and all around good times.</p>

Modern Entertainment began as a DJ Company with just Nick and Tim, but soon after added a Photobooth and Party Bus. In July of 2012, we opened up Vantage Paintball in East Muskegon to help bring tourism and traffic to Muskegon.<strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""> <br/></span></strong></p>

<p>Starting with this perk and applied to every other perk offered, your name will be mentioned on a special thanks page I will be adding to my website. Most importantly though I will be making a large frame that I will put in the entrance of my studio. Within this frame I will add the names of each of you as well as your pictures in case you wish so (you will be contacted at the end of the campaign). This collage of pictures and names will be accompanied with a description of this project and how important it was at its time. I will keep that frame in my studio throughout my career, no matter how big or established I will ever get, in order for everybody coming in, from managers and other producers to famous artists and idols, to know that it was YOU that made this possible and your trust in me back then (now) is the reason that all this happened.</p>
<p>In addition as I will have your emails/addresses, I will keep in contact with each of you (don't worry I won't spam you or stalk you!) and if I ever make it into the ""big"" money working with your most favourite idols, I will make sure you will get some huge surprises at your post some random morning! I'm a fanboy myself and I know exactly how ultimately happy is to have something special from your favourite bias!</p>

<h2><span>$25 Love Message From Korea</span></h2>
<p>Surprise your loved one, family or friends with this exceptional Christmas present! I will write your personal message on a Love Lock or Love Tile and put on Namsan Tower in central Seoul! Then I will take a picture that you can show as a present! This way you will also have your own little thing in Korea waiting for your visit! ^^</p>
<p>You can chose either a lock or a tile. All the tiles and locks will be on place after the end of this campaign and not later than the 15th of December so you can show this picture to somebody as a little extra Christmas present! Your message is going to be readable on the picture and it will be obvious that it's in Korea by the surroundings.</p>
<p>Even if you are not doing this for somebody else, you can write up your little story on the message, like the support for your favourite idol!</p>
<h3><a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/149991/pledges/new?perk_amt=25&amp;perk_id=652950"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.areiacreations.com/indiegogo/claim.png"" src="""" style=""""/></a></h3>

<p>Namsan Tower (or Seoul Tower) is located at the geographical center of Seoul and except the great view it offers two great places to express your love! The area sourounding the tower is covered by thousands of locks put there by people that wanted to have their message shown or express their love. Your message should be a rather short one, something that would fit on an average sized lock. Then your lock will be locked among the rest. Along with its exact location, I will be keeping the key for you and if you come to Korea you can visit areiacreations and I will hand you the key :) </p>
<p>The love tiles are located inside the tower and are attached on its central walls in almost every floor. Your message can be larger compared to the lock and you can actually send me a picture that I will print and stick on the tile! Then your tile will be attached on the wall :)</p>
<p><strong>What you will get</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>I will take two pictures of your lock or tile after they are attached and I will email them to you along with its relevant location so you can find it in case you are visiting Korea!</li>
<li>You will get mentioned on my website and my studio wall</li>

<h2><strong>Silicone Princess</strong></h2>
<p><strong><img alt=""Silicone Princess"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.areiacreations.com/indiegogo/siliconeprincess.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Who is this Princess?<br/></strong></p>
<p>Since the first days of areiacreations on Youtube there has been a strong interest for releasing my own musical works that aren't bound to following another song's arrangement. Since then I have written and worked on several songs for other artists released through Warner Music and other labels but none under my own name.</p>
<p>Silicone Princess is an effort for the production of a quality 8-song album that will bring together the sounds that everybody loved through areia remixes but featuring original songs sung by me and other artists. The album will move through a variety of genres, from electronic dance and pop music down to softer songs with acoustic elements.<br/><br/><strong>How the music will be like?</strong><br/><br/>I'll personally write, arrange and engineer every song in the album, while actively getting feedback from other parties. In fact I've already writen a number of songs, some of them presented <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPi-gHFK3Ag"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">in this preview video</a> released about 2 years ago. Despite the very warm feedback on that preview, I am pretty sure that with the gained experience the target quality can be even higher and I'll be aiming for a <strong>more pop-compatible sound</strong>, while of course retaining some main ""areia"" elements.</p>
<p><strong>Who else is involved?</strong></p>
<p>Except from the songs that I will be singing, I have already presented you in the video the female Korean vocalist Minjoo. Tony is a talented vocalist and dancer with extensive training. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/JulianLimMusic"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Julian Lim</a> is a promising artist from Singapore and I have met him during his training days here in Korea. There are also several indie artists that I will first have to build the studio and work with them so I can make sure they fit for the purposes of the album.</p>
<p><strong>What will I get?</strong><br/><br/>The online version will be in both high quality WAV and 320K MP3 format and will be received by all contributors from the ""Princess"" perk and above. The physical versions I'll be sending to you through this campaign will be limited to the number of contributors and signed personally to you. They will be ""limited"" version and they will include a multi-page coloured booklet.</p>
<p><br/><strong>When will I get it?</strong></p>
<p>The recording and production will start in December with the targeted release date being slightly before summer, around mid-May. You will be kept updated about the progress throughout the next few months via numerous videos released on my Youtube channel featuring the production process and the artists recording live. The digital downloads will be available first and the CDs will be posted immediately as soon as the manufacturing process is complete.</p>

<p><a name=""budget"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a></p>
<h2><strong>The Budget</strong></h2>
<p>During the past many months I've been running the numbers in order to find the right recipe to make this possible. All numbers presented below are given after extensive research for a realistic purchase at minimal cost. All purchases (except if items unavailable) will have to be made within South Korea as importing from abroad implies international shipping and a 20% customs fee which put together is more than the amount saved.</p>
<p>The following setup has been established based on real experience working with such equipment and it is tweaked to fit the minimum requirements for music production at a professional level. Any specific brand and model choices were made out of preference or familiarity with the product and they might be replaced with a similar item from another brand if found to fit the setup better.</p>
<p>I want to be as transparent as possible on how the funds will be spent. For that reason I have created<span class=""""> </span><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/areiastudio"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a new Youtube channel called ""areiastudio""</a>. During the progress of this campaign and the upgrade of the studio I will be posting several videos with me building up the studio, purchasing and installing all the equipment, recording the artists, producing Silicone Princess as well as other videos that associate with the studio.</p>
<p><strong>Physical products manufacturing and shipping cost: $2500<br/></strong><em>(Approximate cost based on 300 CDs of ""Silicone Princess"" <em>with multi-page booklets,</em> manufactured in Korea and shipped internationally. Price also includes the expected shipping and purchase cost of Andamiro's Hypnotize CDs. Shipping from Korea is <em>particularly </em>expensive and thus is calculated in the budget)</em></p>
<p><strong>Studio Room Deposit: $2000 </strong><em>(out of $5000)</em><em><br/>(For a 20sqm or smaller studio room in the cheap part of eastern Seoul with a $300~$500/month rent. A fair deposit requires around $5000 from which $3000 are already saved for this purpose. <strong>Any overfunding goes here</strong> in order to raise the number of available rooms and lower the monthly rent significantly)<br/></em><br/><strong>XEON based Workstation Computer: $3000<br/></strong><em>(2x intel Xeon E5-2620 @ 2.0Ghz CPU, Asus Z9PE-D8 M/B, 32GB Memory, 256GB SSD HD, 2x 2TB Sata III HD, OSX operating system. Custom-build.)<br/><br/></em><strong>Audio Equipment and Software: $3000<br/></strong><em>(Yamaha HS-50M monitor speakers, Se2200a II recording microphone, Avid MBOX3 Pro audio interface, Beyerdynamic DT880 Pro monitoring headphones, Audiotechnica ATH-M50s recording monitor headphones, Behringer Analog Mixer/Console, Avid Pro Tools 10 software, Midi Controller/Keyboard)</em></p>
<p><strong>Additional studio setup: $2000<br/></strong><em>(<em>studio suitable desk, sofa and other furniture, </em>27' computer monitor, audio insulation and acoustic foam, audio cables, other smaller <em>necessities</em>)</em></p>
<p><strong>Campaign fees: $1500<br/></strong><em>(Rough estimate based on the assumption that the $14,000 target will be reached. The fees are as follows: Indiegogo 4%, paypal and credit card clearance 3.9%, currency exchange 2.7%)</em></p>
<p><strong>Overfunding ($14,000+)<br/></strong>Any extra funds will be added to the studio's room deposit money and allow for an extra upgrade on the equipment (most notably the microphone and the audio interface).</p>

<h2><strong>Areia Who?</strong></h2>
<p>My name is Jun Areia and I'm a songwriter, audio engineer and music producer based in Seoul, South Korea. I was born in Corfu, Greece and have studied Audio Technology as well as Video Games Development in UK.</p>
<p>I moved to Korea three years ago with plans to work as a video games programmer but my creative mind had other plans for me. I'm currently working with Warner Music, several independent international artists as well as making songs for the Korean Pop music industry.</p>
<p>My musical adventures have started when as a child I would annoy my sisters that were trying to sleep in the room, since the only way I would fall asleep was to sing melodies for hours every night. In my little fantasy world, I was some kind of famous idol and I was performing, often new songs that I would make up from my mind in a random language. As I was growing up those melodies became compositions that would be later carried to my first production attempts back in 1997. I would call myself Areia and my ""company"" Areiacreations.</p>
<p>While DJing at various clubs and events around the island of Corfu, I have released six albums as an indie artist between 1999~2003. Despite the early success though, back then I have given up my dreams of being a musician since my surroundings would emphasize how unworthy and unstable such a job would be. Indeed I've left my fears take control and I didn't believe in my music or my position in it as a professional. Instead I headed into a more ""stable"" field, that of Computer Science.</p>
<p>
</p><h2>Areia Remix!</h2>
<p></p>
<p>
</p><p>While a university student I would open my music software and compose something new, ""secretly"" from myself. It was my little guilt. Pretty much like that extra large cup of chocolate ice-cream. I should have been studying but instead there I was making music. I have managed to excel in my Games Developement class but my creative mind has already started a revolution that would change my life completely. All the musical knowledge was there since my teenage years, my first degree and my previous production experience. During those days I also started getting familiar with Korea, its culture and its music. I couldn't help it but starting to experiment with changing Korean Pop songs.</p>
<p>You see, I really loved the idols and all those images in the music videos, but the music for my ""western"" standards was kind of ""soft"". Some random day I have started crafting new beats and sounds that fit the original songs as well as syncing the remixes on the music videos so I could enjoy a more ""intense"" experience. Because of my past experiences I was afraid that my hard disk might crash and I would lose all that data so I've uploaded those videos on Youtube in order to preserve them. What would follow... I could never imagine.</p>
<p>Three and a half years, 100 remixes, 20,000 subscribers and 7 million views later, Areia Remix is currently the most popular brand in Korean Pop remixing. It has brighten the days of thousands and has inspired many to follow their dreams. The music behind every single remix, composed and produced from scratch, has its own intense story and it was my chance to let out all those unexpressed melodies from my childhood. Yes! I was finally that ""idol"". Not singing my melodies; but instead writing them, arrange them and deliver them to the world as music.</p>
<p>As ""areia remix"" was becoming bigger, the indications that this wasn't just a random spare-time hobby were multiplying and I have started getting confident again with my position in music. I have made attempts to extent the brand beyond my hands and I have worked with <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/vodgediper"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Vodge Diper</a>, <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/gionatacaracciolomuzik"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gionata Caracciolo</a>, <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/ChristopherVassilakisOfficial"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Christopher Vassilakis</a> and <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/kennyparkz"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kenny Parkz</a>, who have released some of their works with areia remix.</p>
<p>But music for me was still a ""guilt"". Something that I was doing, when I was supposed to do something else that would directly make my life more stable. After a lot of consideration, last December I finally took the decision to give my life to music. I would do everything and keep doing it till it works. And indeed it has.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p><h2>A dream becoming true</h2>
<p>These 15 years of musical efforts and the three years of areia remixes didn't go unnoticed. Just a year into areia remixes I've started receiving the first attention from individual kpop producers and entertainment companies' managers up to recording and production studios in Korea. I've met with established producers and famous kpop idols and I had some small participation or creative input in the final products.<br/><br/>The breakthrough though came when last summer Trophy Entertainment approached me with a professional and serious attitude to work on Andamiro's upcoming mini-album ""Hypnotize"". I have spent several months in the company working with everybody and getting more familiar than ever with the kpop production process. In addition they gave me the rights to produce official remixes for some of their songs. I'm now actively co-operating with Trophy for the production of their artists and beyond.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.areiacreations.com/indiegogo/chichi.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<a name=""timenow"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>
<h2>The time is now!</h2>
<p>This is the time that I need to get out of my Youtube ""cave"" and start putting my ideas together, meet with important people, pass them my songs and work together. During the past few months I have met a large number of enstablished producers and influencial people in the kpop industry and their words are all the same: ""your works are amazing!"", ""bring me some demos!"" and ""let's work together!"". And while in the entertainment industry some times such words are empty promises from the context and the standing I know they actually mean it and I could be making songs for the biggest idols right now!</p>
<p><strong>So what are you waiting for??!</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>Recording, mixing and music production at a professional level requires a decent environment with the proper acoustics and equipment. Seoul though is very densely inhabited and my home is not appropriate for any kind of music production. A studio must be isolated and far from neighbours in order to make sure round-the-clock operation. In addition smooth co-operation with production studios and entertainment companies also requires working with the established software (Pro Tools) as well with a powerful enough workstation that can handle the intense workload involved with music production at this level.</p>
<p>Moreover, for the past three years ""areia remix"" has been the most exciting project of my life and the reason I've finally chosen to follow a music production career path. On the other hand except from your kind donations, I had no income whatsoever from it. Living in Seoul is as expensive as in any other metropolis ($1000+ per month for the basics including rent) and it's the income of my original productions that has been the main contributor for paying that. But under the current circumstances it would never be enough for making the next move.</p>
<p>Breaking through that static situation and making the next move requires a step up! A step that will push my production levels and efficiency on every aspect. A step that would be the milestone of my career but at the same time the hardest one to make alone.</p>
<p>Everything for me is happening in Korea. And it's happening NOW! The producers and the entertainment companies are here, so are the opportunities. It took me years and years of sleepless and reward-less work in order to approach them and this is the right time and place. I went against the social standards and have chosen the hard path, not to compromise to an unsatisfying job so I can commit fully to my dream. I have sacrificed the comfort of my family and friends in Greece and my worriless unlimited visa status in Europe for the pursue of a dream in an unfamiliar place at the other end of the world. I have given my maximum efforts towards pursuing my true identity as a person and making use of my internal talent and core passion: <strong>making music that people can connect to and help them escape the everyday and feel unique and special!</strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong></p>

<h2><strong>FAQ</strong></h2>
<p><strong>What is Kpop? I'm not a kpop fan!</strong><strong><br/> </strong>Kpop stands for Korean Pop music. Popularized throughout the world during the past few years and most recently with PSY's ultra-hit ""Gangnam Style"", kpop is a genre of its own. The most important difference than other popular music around the world is that the artists (the idols) are taken in (literally living in) and trained by their entertainment companies to every aspect from singing to dancing and performing for several years. Millions of dollars are invested in training and this creates an extraordinary quality in the genre.</p>
<p>Even if you are not into kpop music, your contribution to this project will serve to aid several indie and mid-level artists around the world and of any kind of music from rock to pop and dance. As I'm currently working with Warner Music Group and other international artists at a steady basis, I will make sure that those productions will benefit equally and will allow for many new talents from any country and music genre to shine!</p>
<p><strong>$30 for a CD? It usually costs $25 at other funding campaigns.</strong><strong><br/> </strong>Except than the CD being printed at the highest standards including its multi-page booklet, I will be shipping it by air from South Korea which is particularly pricy thus the slight increase in the price.</p>
<p><strong>When is my copy of Hypnotize going to be sent and which version is it?</strong><strong><br/> </strong>Your copy of Hypnotize will be send as soon as this campaign is over, way ahead than Silicone Princess. The CD could be either the ""Promo"" or the ""Commercial"" version depending on the availability. The only difference between the two is that the ""Promo"" version can't be just found around or bought which makes it more rare, pretty much like a limited version. I will keep a strict priority sending this version to the first contributors. If you would like the commercial version instead please feel free to mention so during your contribution.</p>
<p><strong>When is the new studio going to be established?</strong><strong><br/> </strong>I'll start purchasing the required equipment as soon as November and the move in and setup will take place within December and January. By mid-January everything will be setup and fully operational.</p>
<p><strong>Why such a powerful workstation?</strong><strong><br/> </strong>Audio processing in a professional way requires the handling of very large projects with numerous high quality audio files, virtual instruments and effects attached. The faster the workstation the more the productivity and creativity. A slower configuration would result in compromises that would lower the resulting quality and significantly raise the time needed for the completion of the project. For example, a half the price single cpu based configuration would do fine for typical electronic music productions but when pop/rock vocals or real instruments recording and processing are added to the equation things get really demanding. In addition with the proposed budget I won't be able to afford any hardware supported effect units, making the workstation the only processing unit that will have to handle everything in a decent speed. </p>
<p><strong>Custom built-PC?! All trendy producers seem to be using a Mac.</strong><strong><br/> </strong>I don't mind fruits in my room; in fact I will be installing OSX on my workstation and it will be my main platform for working. The question is more of a practical one. Most of my configuration's hardware is nearly identical to what resides inside a Mac. In comparison though, a Mac Pro with a similar configuration costs approximately $8,000. I'd definatelly rather be more practical and put that extra money into purchasing better audio equipment or increasing the room's deposit and leave the trendiness for the future.</p>
<p><strong>I thought pro-audio hardware is way more expensive!?</strong><strong><br/> </strong>The range of professional equipment is very large and of course there are some great stuff out there. I'm being realistic here though and I have minimized the requirements down to the absolutely necessary. Besides I'm not going to be recording Big Bang or SNSD any time soon. The proposed equipment though is just enough for the creation of original songs and the production of artists from the indie up to the mid-range level.</p>
<p><strong>I have a suggestion to make for a change in your configuration.</strong><strong><br/> </strong>While the equipment is tweaked as the minimal quality solution to the requirements, you are more than welcome to make any suggestions based on your experience and I could consider some small changes in the equipment choices!</p>
<p><strong>I know of a very cheap place to get some of this equipment.</strong><strong><br/> </strong>Searching the internet I'm able to see how cheaper (~25%) it would be to purchase this setup if I was living in the States and it makes me kind of sad. But I'm not living there and in some cases I'll have to pay as much as 40% more in order to obtain the same product in Korea. I've done my research though and I've tried to avoid such brands and items. Still, feel free to suggest any shops that could make a significant difference. Please mind that I would avoid eBay for warranty reasons and I wouldn't purchase software licences that are not in my name. More importantly though remember the automatic extra 25% or more from the price you find for customs and shipping fees!</p>
<p><strong>Why is the studio room so expensive to rent?</strong><strong><br/> </strong>Real estate in Korea is a monster with its own soul. As a westerner I never understood the need of those enormous deposits just to get your feet in a tiny room but that's the reality. I find the rents exhausting too as I've been living in non-capital cities throughout my entire life. But on a second thought except from an extremely fast developing and prosperous city, after Tokyo, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_metropolitan_areas_by_population"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Seoul is the largest metropolis on the planet</a>, which pretty much justifies everything. In a mid range priced area, for a 20sqm single room setup (kitchen and bedroom are together), a $5000 deposit and $500 rent is pretty much the standard. In fact more than 70% of the rooms require at least a $10,000 deposit, significantly bringing down the number of available choices. In addition as a rough rule, for every $1,000 you give in deposit the $10 less becomes your monthly rent, up to making it to the $30,000~$40,000 range where you can start touching rooms with $0 monthly rent - which is my ultimate target for the near future.</p>
<p>Of course by ""deposit"" I'm talking about the amount of money that you hand in on the first day you get in the house and that you take back fully at the end of your contract. So on the bright that money are secured and not spent on super expensive rents like a typical western metropolis. Another limiting factor is the noise I'll have to be making during production and that's going to be all around the clock. I don't want to make the neighbours lives miserable so the room is limited pretty much to basements or rooms that are relatively far from others, something almost impossible in the super densely inhabited Seoul, lowering the number of available rooms further.</p>
<p><strong>What if the full amount is not collected? Will I still receive my CD?</strong><strong><br/> </strong>The less the donations the less the CDs I will have to produce anyway. The priority is collecting the money required for giving back to you what I've promised. Therefore no matter which perk you choose, the delivery is pretty much guaranteed<strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What about the remaining fan funded remixes and the Twinkle cover?</strong><strong><br/> </strong>The choice of fan funding my remixes for $50 was completely unproductive as it resulted in heaps of work (50 studio hours for each remix) with no realistic income. This had very damaging results to my long term prospects as it left me with no time to work for my actual living and I therefore had to slow down in order to commit to income critical projects, such as official productions. I have terminated that option and I'm working to release the last remixes funded in that way as well as the Twinkle cover productions. The list of those remixes can be found at my website and they will be all released gradually throughout the next few months.</p>
<p><strong>What about that NU ABO remix I've been hyping all these years!?</strong><strong><br/> </strong>While moving to Korea I have experienced a critical damage on my hard disk resulting in the loss of its project files. It is one of my priorities to attempt remaking the exact same sounds from scratch, after the new studio is completed. It is a very challenging attempt but be sure I'll get it done.</p>
<p><strong>Will you continue making kpop remixes or is this end?</strong><strong><br/> </strong>Absolute yes! ""areia remix"" and your support towards it is the reason I'm here and the only change that could ever happen (and I'm actively pursuing) is the official establishment of the brand that would bring more releases of great quality, supported by their respecting entertainment companies. In fact this very funding campaign is exactly what will guarantee the long-term viability of areia remixes and allow me to explore more opportunities for official remixes. </p>

Along with its exact location, I will be keeping the key for you and if you come to Korea you can visit areiacreations and I will hand you the key :) 
The love tiles are located inside the tower and are attached on its central walls in almost every floor. Your message can be larger compared to the lock and you can actually send me a picture that I will print and stick on the tile! Then your tile will be attached on the wall :)

Silicone Princess

Who is this Princess?
Since the first days of areiacreations on Youtube there has been a strong interest for releasing my own musical works that aren't bound to following another song's arrangement. Since then I have written and worked on several songs for other artists released through Warner Music and other labels but none under my own name.
Silicone Princess is an effort for the production of a quality 8-song album that will bring together the sounds that everybody loved through areia remixes but featuring original songs sung by me and other artists. The album will move through a variety of genres, from electronic dance and pop music down to softer songs with acoustic elements.How the music will be like?I'll personally write, arrange and engineer every song in the album, while actively getting feedback from other parties. In fact I've already writen a number of songs, some of them presented in this preview video released about 2 years ago. Despite the very warm feedback on that preview, I am pretty sure that with the gained experience the target quality can be even higher and I'll be aiming for a more pop-compatible sound, while of course retaining some main ""areia"" elements.
Who else is involved?
Except from the songs that I will be singing, I have already presented you in the video the female Korean vocalist Minjoo. Tony is a talented vocalist and dancer with extensive training. Julian Lim is a promising artist from Singapore and I have met him during his training days here in Korea. There are also several indie artists that I will first have to build the studio and work with them so I can make sure they fit for the purposes of the album.
What will I get?The online version will be in both high quality WAV and 320K MP3 format and will be received by all contributors from the ""Princess"" perk and above. The physical versions I'll be sending to you through this campaign will be limited to the number of contributors and signed personally to you. They will be ""limited"" version and they will include a multi-page coloured booklet.
When will I get it?
The recording and production will start in December with the targeted release date being slightly before summer, around mid-May. You will be kept updated about the progress throughout the next few months via numerous videos released on my Youtube channel featuring the production process and the artists recording live. The digital downloads will be available first and the CDs will be posted immediately as soon as the manufacturing process is complete.


The Budget
During the past many months I've been running the numbers in order to find the right recipe to make this possible. All numbers presented below are given after extensive research for a realistic purchase at minimal cost. All purchases (except if items unavailable) will have to be made within South Korea as importing from abroad implies international shipping and a 20% customs fee which put together is more than the amount saved.
The following setup has been established based on real experience working with such equipment and it is tweaked to fit the minimum requirements for music production at a professional level. Any specific brand and model choices were made out of preference or familiarity with the product and they might be replaced with a similar item from another brand if found to fit the setup better.
I want to be as transparent as possible on how the funds will be spent. For that reason I have created a new Youtube channel called ""areiastudio"". During the progress of this campaign and the upgrade of the studio I will be posting several videos with me building up the studio, purchasing and installing all the equipment, recording the artists, producing Silicone Princess as well as other videos that associate with the studio.
Physical products manufacturing and shipping cost: $2500(Approximate cost based on 300 CDs of ""Silicone Princess"" with multi-page booklets, manufactured in Korea and shipped internationally. Price also includes the expected shipping and purchase cost of Andamiro's Hypnotize CDs. Shipping from Korea is particularly expensive and thus is calculated in the budget)
Studio Room Deposit: $2000 (out of $5000)(For a 20sqm or smaller studio room in the cheap part of eastern Seoul with a $300~$500/month rent. A fair deposit requires around $5000 from which $3000 are already saved for this purpose. Any overfunding goes here in order to raise the number of available rooms and lower the monthly rent significantly)XEON based Workstation Computer: $3000(2x intel Xeon E5-2620 @ 2.0Ghz CPU, Asus Z9PE-D8 M/B, 32GB Memory, 256GB SSD HD, 2x 2TB Sata III HD, OSX operating system. Custom-build.)Audio Equipment and Software: $3000(Yamaha HS-50M monitor speakers, Se2200a II recording microphone, Avid MBOX3 Pro audio interface, Beyerdynamic DT880 Pro monitoring headphones, Audiotechnica ATH-M50s recording monitor headphones, Behringer Analog Mixer/Console, Avid Pro Tools 10 software, Midi Controller/Keyboard)
Additional studio setup: $2000(studio suitable desk, sofa and other furniture, 27' computer monitor, audio insulation and acoustic foam, audio cables, other smaller necessities)
Campaign fees: $1500(Rough estimate based on the assumption that the $14,000 target will be reached. The fees are as follows: Indiegogo 4%, paypal and credit card clearance 3.9%, currency exchange 2.7%)
Overfunding ($14,000+)Any extra funds will be added to the studio's room deposit money and allow for an extra upgrade on the equipment (most notably the microphone and the audio interface).
 


Areia Who?
My name is Jun Areia and I'm a songwriter, audio engineer and music producer based in Seoul, South Korea. I was born in Corfu, Greece and have studied Audio Technology as well as Video Games Development in UK.
I moved to Korea three years ago with plans to work as a video games programmer but my creative mind had other plans for me. I'm currently working with Warner Music, several independent international artists as well as making songs for the Korean Pop music industry.
My musical adventures have started when as a child I would annoy my sisters that were trying to sleep in the room, since the only way I would fall asleep was to sing melodies for hours every night. In my little fantasy world, I was some kind of famous idol and I was performing, often new songs that I would make up from my mind in a random language. As I was growing up those melodies became compositions that would be later carried to my first production attempts back in 1997. I would call myself Areia and my ""company"" Areiacreations.
While DJing at various clubs and events around the island of Corfu, I have released six albums as an indie artist between 1999~2003. Despite the early success though, back then I have given up my dreams of being a musician since my surroundings would emphasize how unworthy and unstable such a job would be. Indeed I've left my fears take control and I didn't believe in my music or my position in it as a professional. Instead I headed into a more ""stable"" field, that of Computer Science.

Areia Remix!


While a university student I would open my music software and compose something new, ""secretly"" from myself. It was my little guilt. Pretty much like that extra large cup of chocolate ice-cream. I should have been studying but instead there I was making music. I have managed to excel in my Games Developement class but my creative mind has already started a revolution that would change my life completely. All the musical knowledge was there since my teenage years, my first degree and my previous production experience. During those days I also started getting familiar with Korea, its culture and its music. I couldn't help it but starting to experiment with changing Korean Pop songs.
You see, I really loved the idols and all those images in the music videos, but the music for my ""western"" standards was kind of ""soft"". Some random day I have started crafting new beats and sounds that fit the original songs as well as syncing the remixes on the music videos so I could enjoy a more ""intense"" experience. Because of my past experiences I was afraid that my hard disk might crash and I would lose all that data so I've uploaded those videos on Youtube in order to preserve them. What would follow... I could never imagine.
Three and a half years, 100 remixes, 20,000 subscribers and 7 million views later, Areia Remix is currently the most popular brand in Korean Pop remixing. It has brighten the days of thousands and has inspired many to follow their dreams. The music behind every single remix, composed and produced from scratch, has its own intense story and it was my chance to let out all those unexpressed melodies from my childhood. Yes! I was finally that ""idol"". Not singing my melodies; but instead writing them, arrange them and deliver them to the world as music.
As ""areia remix"" was becoming bigger, the indications that this wasn't just a random spare-time hobby were multiplying and I have started getting confident again with my position in music. I have made attempts to extent the brand beyond my hands and I have worked with Vodge Diper, Gionata Caracciolo, Christopher Vassilakis and Kenny Parkz, who have released some of their works with areia remix.
But music for me was still a ""guilt"". Something that I was doing, when I was supposed to do something else that would directly make my life more stable. After a lot of consideration, last December I finally took the decision to give my life to music. I would do everything and keep doing it till it works. And indeed it has.


A dream becoming true
These 15 years of musical efforts and the three years of areia remixes didn't go unnoticed. Just a year into areia remixes I've started receiving the first attention from individual kpop producers and entertainment companies' managers up to recording and production studios in Korea. I've met with established producers and famous kpop idols and I had some small participation or creative input in the final products.The breakthrough though came when last summer Trophy Entertainment approached me with a professional and serious attitude to work on Andamiro's upcoming mini-album ""Hypnotize"". I have spent several months in the company working with everybody and getting more familiar than ever with the kpop production process. In addition they gave me the rights to produce official remixes for some of their songs. I'm now actively co-operating with Trophy for the production of their artists and beyond.


The time is now!
This is the time that I need to get out of my Youtube ""cave"" and start putting my ideas together, meet with important people, pass them my songs and work together. During the past few months I have met a large number of enstablished producers and influencial people in the kpop industry and their words are all the same: ""your works are amazing!"", ""bring me some demos!"" and ""let's work together!"". And while in the entertainment industry some times such words are empty promises from the context and the standing I know they actually mean it and I could be making songs for the biggest idols right now!
So what are you waiting for??!

Recording, mixing and music production at a professional level requires a decent environment with the proper acoustics and equipment. Seoul though is very densely inhabited and my home is not appropriate for any kind of music production. A studio must be isolated and far from neighbours in order to make sure round-the-clock operation. In addition smooth co-operation with production studios and entertainment companies also requires working with the established software (Pro Tools) as well with a powerful enough workstation that can handle the intense workload involved with music production at this level.
Moreover, for the past three years ""areia remix"" has been the most exciting project of my life and the reason I've finally chosen to follow a music production career path. On the other hand except from your kind donations, I had no income whatsoever from it. Living in Seoul is as expensive as in any other metropolis ($1000+ per month for the basics including rent) and it's the income of my original productions that has been the main contributor for paying that. But under the current circumstances it would never be enough for making the next move.
Breaking through that static situation and making the next move requires a step up! A step that will push my production levels and efficiency on every aspect. A step that would be the milestone of my career but at the same time the hardest one to make alone.
Everything for me is happening in Korea. And it's happening NOW! The producers and the entertainment companies are here, so are the opportunities. It took me years and years of sleepless and reward-less work in order to approach them and this is the right time and place. I went against the social standards and have chosen the hard path, not to compromise to an unsatisfying job so I can commit fully to my dream. I have sacrificed the comfort of my family and friends in Greece and my worriless unlimited visa status in Europe for the pursue of a dream in an unfamiliar place at the other end of the world. I have given my maximum efforts towards pursuing my true identity as a person and making use of my internal talent and core passion: making music that people can connect to and help them escape the everyday and feel unique and special!  


FAQ
What is Kpop? I'm not a kpop fan! Kpop stands for Korean Pop music. Popularized throughout the world during the past few years and most recently with PSY's ultra-hit ""Gangnam Style"", kpop is a genre of its own. The most important difference than other popular music around the world is that the artists (the idols) are taken in (literally living in) and trained by their entertainment companies to every aspect from singing to dancing and performing for several years. Millions of dollars are invested in training and this creates an extraordinary quality in the genre.
Even if you are not into kpop music, your contribution to this project will serve to aid several indie and mid-level artists around the world and of any kind of music from rock to pop and dance. As I'm currently working with Warner Music Group and other international artists at a steady basis, I will make sure that those productions will benefit equally and will allow for many new talents from any country and music genre to shine!
$30 for a CD? It usually costs $25 at other funding campaigns. Except than the CD being printed at the highest standards including its multi-page booklet, I will be shipping it by air from South Korea which is particularly pricy thus the slight increase in the price.
When is my copy of Hypnotize going to be sent and which version is it? Your copy of Hypnotize will be send as soon as this campaign is over, way ahead than Silicone Princess. The CD could be either the ""Promo"" or the ""Commercial"" version depending on the availability. The only difference between the two is that the ""Promo"" version can't be just found around or bought which makes it more rare, pretty much like a limited version. I will keep a strict priority sending this version to the first contributors. If you would like the commercial version instead please feel free to mention so during your contribution.
When is the new studio going to be established? I'll start purchasing the required equipment as soon as November and the move in and setup will take place within December and January. By mid-January everything will be setup and fully operational.
Why such a powerful workstation? Audio processing in a professional way requires the handling of very large projects with numerous high quality audio files, virtual instruments and effects attached. The faster the workstation the more the productivity and creativity. A slower configuration would result in compromises that would lower the resulting quality and significantly raise the time needed for the completion of the project. For example, a half the price single cpu based configuration would do fine for typical electronic music productions but when pop/rock vocals or real instruments recording and processing are added to the equation things get really demanding. In addition with the proposed budget I won't be able to afford any hardware supported effect units, making the workstation the only processing unit that will have to handle everything in a decent speed. 
Custom built-PC?! All trendy producers seem to be using a Mac. I don't mind fruits in my room; in fact I will be installing OSX on my workstation and it will be my main platform for working. The question is more of a practical one. Most of my configuration's hardware is nearly identical to what resides inside a Mac. In comparison though, a Mac Pro with a similar configuration costs approximately $8,000. I'd definatelly rather be more practical and put that extra money into purchasing better audio equipment or increasing the room's deposit and leave the trendiness for the future.
I thought pro-audio hardware is way more expensive!? The range of professional equipment is very large and of course there are some great stuff out there. I'm being realistic here though and I have minimized the requirements down to the absolutely necessary. Besides I'm not going to be recording Big Bang or SNSD any time soon. The proposed equipment though is just enough for the creation of original songs and the production of artists from the indie up to the mid-range level.
I have a suggestion to make for a change in your configuration. While the equipment is tweaked as the minimal quality solution to the requirements, you are more than welcome to make any suggestions based on your experience and I could consider some small changes in the equipment choices!
I know of a very cheap place to get some of this equipment. Searching the internet I'm able to see how cheaper (~25%) it would be to purchase this setup if I was living in the States and it makes me kind of sad. But I'm not living there and in some cases I'll have to pay as much as 40% more in order to obtain the same product in Korea. I've done my research though and I've tried to avoid such brands and items. Still, feel free to suggest any shops that could make a significant difference. Please mind that I would avoid eBay for warranty reasons and I wouldn't purchase software licences that are not in my name. More importantly though remember the automatic extra 25% or more from the price you find for customs and shipping fees!
Why is the studio room so expensive to rent? Real estate in Korea is a monster with its own soul. As a westerner I never understood the need of those enormous deposits just to get your feet in a tiny room but that's the reality. I find the rents exhausting too as I've been living in non-capital cities throughout my entire life. But on a second thought except from an extremely fast developing and prosperous city, after Tokyo, Seoul is the largest metropolis on the planet, which pretty much justifies everything. In a mid range priced area, for a 20sqm single room setup (kitchen and bedroom are together), a $5000 deposit and $500 rent is pretty much the standard. In fact more than 70% of the rooms require at least a $10,000 deposit, significantly bringing down the number of available choices. In addition as a rough rule, for every $1,000 you give in deposit the $10 less becomes your monthly rent, up to making it to the $30,000~$40,000 range where you can start touching rooms with $0 monthly rent - which is my ultimate target for the near future.
Of course by ""deposit"" I'm talking about the amount of money that you hand in on the first day you get in the house and that you take back fully at the end of your contract. So on the bright that money are secured and not spent on super expensive rents like a typical western metropolis. Another limiting factor is the noise I'll have to be making during production and that's going to be all around the clock. I don't want to make the neighbours lives miserable so the room is limited pretty much to basements or rooms that are relatively far from others, something almost impossible in the super densely inhabited Seoul, lowering the number of available rooms further.
What if the full amount is not collected? Will I still receive my CD? The less the donations the less the CDs I will have to produce anyway. The priority is collecting the money required for giving back to you what I've promised. Therefore no matter which perk you choose, the delivery is pretty much guaranteed.
What about the remaining fan funded remixes and the Twinkle cover? The choice of fan funding my remixes for $50 was completely unproductive as it resulted in heaps of work (50 studio hours for each remix) with no realistic income. This had very damaging results to my long term prospects as it left me with no time to work for my actual living and I therefore had to slow down in order to commit to income critical projects, such as official productions. I have terminated that option and I'm working to release the last remixes funded in that way as well as the Twinkle cover productions. The list of those remixes can be found at my website and they will be all released gradually throughout the next few months.
What about that NU ABO remix I've been hyping all these years!? While moving to Korea I have experienced a critical damage on my hard disk resulting in the loss of its project files. It is one of my priorities to attempt remaking the exact same sounds from scratch, after the new studio is completed. It is a very challenging attempt but be sure I'll get it done.
Will you continue making kpop remixes or is this end? Absolute yes! ""areia remix"" and your support towards it is the reason I'm here and the only change that could ever happen (and I'm actively pursuing) is the official establishment of the brand that would bring more releases of great quality, supported by their respecting entertainment companies. In fact this very funding campaign is exactly what will guarantee the long-term viability of areia remixes and allow me to explore more opportunities for official remixes.",24.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Starting a crowd-funding campaign to record your debut-album is a bit crazy. Waiting to be signed by a record label in the current state of the music industry is even crazier. Yossarian has been together for three years writing songs we are passionate about and that we believe would make a great album. <strong>That’s why we’ve taken to this windy path alone, and that’s why we need your help!</strong></p>
</div>
<h3>What do you need so much money for?</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>£6,000 ($10,000)</strong> is the minimum amount we need in order to track, produce, mix, master and release the album to a standard that we will proud of. This is how the money will be used:</p>
<p><strong>Tracking: £2,200.</strong> This involves paying for the studio time to record all the tracks: drums, guitars, vocals, bass, horns, strings, synths, and a long etcetera.<br/><strong>Mixing: £2,600.</strong> If only it were a process of recording everything and jamming it together… Unfortunately it’s not. Piecing all the tracks together requires a professional producer with a keen ear for music and a passion for our stuff. We have to pay not only for his time but also for the studio time.<br/><strong>Mastering: £600.</strong> Once that tracks have been mixed individually. Another person comes to listen to them with a fresh mind to give it the final touches that make it sound amazing and like a proper album instead of individually recorded songs.<br/><strong>Artwork/Printing/Packaging: £1,200.</strong> This money will be used for the actual physical stuff: printing out the CDs, postcards, posters, framing the original pieces of artwork and dispatching everything.</p>
<h3>What do I get in return?</h3>
<div>
<p>Firstly, everyone contributing to our campaign will be thanked within the album artwork and on our website. On top of that your karma will receive an amazing boost for a minimum of three months.</p>
<p>Also, depending on how much you collaborate with, you can receive a pre-release copy of the album, a copy of the album in Spanish, a piece of original artwork, get us to record the album in the language of your choice and whole load of other amazing things. It’s pretty simple, check the perks on the sidebar on the right and choose how you'd best like to help us and what you'd like to receive in return!</p>
<p>Yes, if we hit our target we’ll record some of the songs in the album in Spanish (if we hit $15,000 we’ll do the entire album!).</p>
<h3>But what do you sound like?</h3>
<div>
<p>If you haven’t heard us yet, you can listen to our stuff in our official website <a href=""http://www.yossarian.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Yossarian Official Website"">Yossarian.com</a> (also in Spanish!) or on <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/yossarianmusic"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Yossarian in Soundcloud"">Soundcloud</a>.

<h3>The story so far..</h3>
<p>Last summer we started the only festival in the world entirely dedicated to disco music. 46 DJs and artists from 9 countries gathered in a forest outside of Stockholm, Sweden.</p>
<p>Everybody involved worked for free, from sound engineers to kitchen staff to make this event possible. We even got to borrow a huge sound system which saved us a lot of money. But the most remarkable thing was that everybody performing on the festival also travelled there at their own expenses. All for the love of music!</p>
<p>Since the whole event is <strong>100% non-commercial</strong>, we would like to ask you to help us show our gratitude.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>On August 9th 2013 we would like to arrange the festival again, and then we would like to be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pay the travel costs for our invited DJs and artists and be able to hand out a small fee for their efforts.</li>
<li>Improve the festival in terms of decoration, security and medical care.</li>
<li>Build a better DJ booth, as the last was a hay wagon.</li>
</ul>
<p>To make our dreams come true, we need your help to raise $30.000. As a token of appreciation we will reward you by giving out some unique perks. <br/>For your valuable contribution we are ready to send you everything from festival tshirts to VIP tickets with travel and hotel included! </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By helping us achieve our goal, you are also helping to preserve music culture. The festival is non commercial and the DJs and guests are the biggest music enthusiasts who are even willing to pay their own tickets to be able to perform. How often does that happen in a world where people are rarely even ready to pay for the music they listen to? </p>
<p>Here are some reactions from our visitors:</p>
<p><em>""I think I can truthfully say that this was the best weekend of my life! I met lots of new people from all over the world at Camp Cosmic and everybody was so friendly, you know that special spirit of friendship, hospitality and positive vibrations were around me all of those days... it was really awesome! Great people, great music, and being surrounded by creativity and energy thats what Camp Cosmic is all about.</em><br/><em>So overall, with all my heart I thank you Camp Cosmic organizers, DJ's, guys from the bar and kitchen, volunteers and all who been there for throwing an amazing festival. </em><br/><em>An unforgettable journey. Hope to see ya soon!"" <br/>(Russia)</em></p>
<p><em>""A new and yes, COSMIC chapter in The History Of Disco. Tremendous."" <br/>(Finland)</em></p>

<p><em>""Wonderful people, impressive setting and organization, tremendous sound system."" (France)</em></p>

</div><p></p></div>","Please note: The show may be over, but we're still running this Indiegogo campaign to give you the opportunity to pre-order the DVD!




Trains, Cannonballs, Romance!



Come see Buster Keaton's classic 1926 comedy The General and feast your ears on:




78 minutes of thrilling original music!


Performed live in the pit by an 11-piece chamber orchestra at Tucson's historic Fox Theatre!


All for a film Orson Welles called ""the greatest comedy ever made, the greatest Civil War film ever made, and perhaps the greatest film ever made.""

And this time we're releasing a DVD!


What can you about it? 
Your support through this Indiegogo campaign helps us tremendously, and we hope it helps you, too. For example:
This is a great way to get your tickets! (They'll be under your name at Will-Call.)
And a great way to pre-order the DVD!
All while supporting strange chamber music in Tucson, AZ!

Where Does the Money Go?
The $2,000 goal is a modest one, and will help:
Pay the hardworking musicians.
Pay for recording the concert for our DVD!
Move the piano (twice) and tune it.
Print programs.
Print DVDs and T-shirts!
Should we exceed our $2,000 goal, those additional funds will help:

Pay the hardworking musicians a bit more!
Pay the composers!
Fund the ChamberLab war chest for future amazing projects.

We definitely hope to exceed our goal! (And we hope you'll make it happen.)
Wait, a DVD???That's right! We're using the original 1926 version of The General, which entered the public domain in 1954, allowing us to make beautiful music with it, and enshrine the result in space-aged plastic disks for your long-lasting enjoyment. This DVD will feature our entire live soundtrack synced to the film from beginning to end, just as you'll enjoy it in the theater! 
With you, it's better! Your help matters! When you support this campaign with your donations, and when you share this campaign with your friends and family, you are making this show possible and we are grateful. Thank you! And to thank you even more:

 Every contributor to this Indiegogo campaign will be recognized in the program for the concert (provided contributions are made before the program goes to press, which is likely Wednesday the 25th)!


All who contribute at a DVD-receiving level will have their names listed on the honor roll of supporters in the DVD packaging!

Of course we'll withhold your names if you elect to support us anonymously! But we'll still be grateful!

Don't be a stranger.

<p><strong>This is my debut, full length, studio album, and I need your help with finishing it and making it a reality!  </strong>Recorded live with the band at the end of April, the album, self-titled <i>“K.C. Harris”</i> consists of <strong>Daniel Lennon</strong> on guitar, <strong>Joe Soldati</strong> on bass, <strong>Jack McChesney</strong> on drums, <strong>Riley Hoover</strong> on guitar and <strong>Brian Graham</strong> on guitar.  The songs on the album span several years of writing (most of which were written in the last year—although, some songs have been featured on previous EPs, such as the title track of “Human Just The Same - EP"" and songs off of “The California Tapes”).<br/><br/>I make music that I love, that I want to listen to, and that I am incredibly proud of, and because of that, I believe that some people out there might enjoy it as well.  I also believe that if I am going to ask people to invest in a product like this, they should know exactly what they’re backing—so, with that being said, I invite you to <strong>listen to the entire finished album…</strong></p>

<p><strong>I am a constant student of this music, and I take what I create very seriously.</strong>  This sort of music is becoming harder and harder to find nowadays—it’s still out there to salvage, if you are committed to pursuing it, and that’s a process that tends to naturally weed out all but those that are the most devout to it.</p>
<p>The foundation of what I create is bonded together by the music of <strong>The Carter Family</strong>, <strong>Lead Belly</strong>, <strong>Roscoe Holcomb</strong>, <strong>Hobart Smith</strong>, <strong>Clarence Ashley</strong>, <strong>Dock Boggs</strong>, <strong>Charlie Poole</strong>, <strong>Uncle Dave Macon</strong>, medicine show acts like <strong>Frank Hutchison</strong>, <strong>Daddy Stovepipe &amp; Mississippi Sarah</strong>, and nameless predecessors that carried these songs and tunes like sacred stone tablets in their minds.</p>
<p>Now, latter-day people and groups out there such as <strong>The Deslondes</strong>, <strong>Houndmouth</strong>, <strong>Dawes</strong>, <strong>The Milk Carton Kids</strong>, <strong>Gary Clark Jr.</strong>, <strong>Leon Bridges</strong>, <strong>Benjamin Booker</strong> and many others have taken what they’ve needed from these traditions and contorted, warped and bastardized what didn’t for them—as has been the tradition since human beings first began playing music.</p>
<p>Performers such as <strong>Dom Flemons</strong> (previously of <strong>The Carolina Chocolate Drops</strong>) and <strong>Willie Watson</strong> (previously of <strong>Old Crow Medicine Show</strong>) have taken up the mantle of modern songsters to keep these songs and traditions alive. To that, I commend them.  But even those performers filter and embody that music in their own idiosyncratic ways, as all performers do.  Even so-called “revival” singers, such as <strong>Ramblin’ Jack Elliott</strong>, <strong>Dave Van Ronk</strong>, <strong>Pete Seeger</strong>, <strong>The Clancy Brothers</strong>, <strong>Josh White</strong>, the <strong>New Lost City Ramblers</strong>, <strong>Jean Ritchie</strong>, <strong>Doc Watson</strong> and <strong>Sonny Terry &amp; Brownie McGhee</strong> were interpreting songs and tunes in ways that worked for them—as the “old-time” musicians, that they had placed so highly on pedestals had made alterations too.  You can’t escape the evolution of this music.  It is never static.  This music has never disappeared—sometimes it just blends into the backdrop a bit.</p>
<p>For myself, my life has been landmarked by moments of interaction with this music.  Whether it was seeing <strong>Taj Mahal</strong> as a kid, and not blinking while watching his right hand, or many years later, shaking the hand of <strong>Ramblin’ Jack Elliott</strong>, a man who embodies much of my own aspirations, it’s difficult for me to separate my life from the music. </p>
<p>The many genres that sprouted from this fertile soil of American music have had major effects on me as well, most notably country, blues and jazz.  With country, what I take from the genre is mainly esthetics; instrumentation, the sonic landscape of the pieces, and even basic song frameworks (that is an extension of traditional music).  I owe a lot to people like <strong>Jimmie Rodgers</strong>, <strong>Hank Williams</strong>, <strong>Ernest Tubb</strong>, the outlaws; <strong>Johnny Cash</strong>, <strong>Waylon Jennings</strong>, <strong>Kris Kristofferson</strong>, <strong>Merle Haggard</strong>, and <strong>Willie Nelson</strong> for solidifying certain musical tropes, as well as providing incredible musical inspiration. </p>
<p>Blues is an almost boundless treasure trove of material.  It’s a beautiful depiction of how far a genre can stretch over time.  It inspires awe to witness how one genre can facilitate the needs of artists for a century—spanning from acoustic artists like <strong>Charlie Patton</strong>, <strong>Blind Lemon Jefferson</strong> and <strong>Bukka White</strong>, through the stormy electrified chime of Chicago blues’ <strong>Howlin’ Wolf</strong>, <strong>Little Walter</strong> and <strong>Paul Butterfield</strong>.  Blues is more than structure, it’s a unified field of hymn that has energized folks longer than almost all other American genres.  Without blues, my and most others’ work would be near unrecognizable. </p>
<p>What I take from jazz is, although not entirely ­– there are many aspects of the music that I have looted aurally ­– heavily based on the approach and attitude to the music that jazz musicians would take: improvisation, nothing is sacred, nothing sounds the same twice.  Over the years, these genres have proved to be three of the most malleable sects of music America has to offer. </p>
<p>I know that I am looking for a niche group of people to back this campaign, but I have no intent of being able to be easily digested and processed by the mass public.  What I am looking to do is to blaze my own path, and to brand my own mark on music like others that have come before me, songwriters like: <strong>Tom Waits</strong>, <strong>John Prine</strong>, <strong>John Denver</strong>, <strong>Bob Dylan</strong>, <strong>Townes Van Zandt</strong>, <strong>Gordon Lightfoot</strong>, <strong>Buddy Holly</strong>, <strong>Chuck Berry</strong>, <strong>Todd Snider</strong>, <strong>Woody Guthrie</strong>, <strong>Robbie Robertson</strong>, <strong>Lou Reed</strong>, <strong>Tom Petty</strong>, <strong>Warren Zevon</strong>, <strong>Patti Smith</strong>, <strong>Captain Beefheart</strong>, <strong>Rodriguez</strong>, <strong>Steve Goodman</strong>, <strong>John Hiatt</strong>, <strong>Leon Russell</strong>, <strong>Stephen Foster</strong>, <strong>Nick Cave</strong>, <strong>Fats Domino &amp; Dave Bartholomew</strong>, and <strong>Henry Thomas</strong>. </p>
<p>I don’t know where my material falls on the spectrum of these giants that I cherish and commend, but I know that it is mine.  And I know that while I’m here, I only have interest in writing and singing the things that only I can create and conjure up.  So, that’s what I’m gonna do. <br/><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1500071609/ytwunmhgfcyammr4invn.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong><br/><strong>The funds raised through this project will be going towards four aspects of creating and releasing the album.</strong>  The first two steps have been completed out of pocket, but my hope is that through this campaign, I can follow through with the rest of the album and create something tangible and incredible.<br/><br/>1. <strong>Recording: </strong>The album was recorded at Dimension Sound Studios in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts, April 29th and 30th, 2017.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Mixing/Mastering: </strong>The editing, mixing and mastering for the album was done by <strong>Dan Cardinal</strong> at Dimension Sound Studios—Dan has worked with the likes of <strong>Lake Street Dive</strong>, <strong>Bruce Molsky</strong>, <strong>Tony Trischka</strong> and many others.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Manufacturing: </strong>A huge part of this campaign is raising funds for the creation of LP vinyl record copies of the album, as well as CD copies of the album and online distribution to places such as iTunes, Spotify, Apple Music, Google Play, Amazon and more.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Promoting: </strong>Funds for promotion can be utilized for anything from online promotion, via social media, to touring and more.</p>
<p>In exchange for your help, I've put together a really exciting group of rewards for your participation in this campaign!  Plus, every tier of perks come with an <strong>IMMEDIATE DOWNLOAD OF THE ALBUM!<br/><br/>Along with the preparations being made for the album, I have also been working hard on creating my own independent record label, Roosic Records!</strong>  The hope is that Roosic will not only allow me full creative control over what I am recording and then sending out into the world, but also allow me, in the future, the ability to construct a platform for other songwriters’ works to be displayed.  Music is not only something that I make, but it is also something that I am constantly consuming and searching for.  The idea of building something that facilitates not only my ability to find and enjoy new, exciting music, but also allow others too, is very exciting to me.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503862699/t7vjgmri3ualfecnffi1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><i>“All I want to do is just work.  I love the work.  It’s fun.  It’s really fun to do—to be able to perform and feel that communication, because you know that you’re putting out as much as you can, and there’s no doubt about that.”<br/>–Gordon Lightfoot</i><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499879298/fctnylb3wxjamtgaig1e.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><strong>This album will have a major impact on me moving forward.  </strong>Having a full-length album of original material will help to open doors, not only to play at more venues, but also to allow me the opportunity to expose my music to more people.  If you want and can contribute to the campaign, just click the pink ""BACK IT"" button at the top of this page!

</div></div>","This is my debut, full length, studio album, and I need your help with finishing it and making it a reality!  Recorded live with the band at the end of April, the album, self-titled “K.C. Harris” consists of Daniel Lennon on guitar, Joe Soldati on bass, Jack McChesney on drums, Riley Hoover on guitar and Brian Graham on guitar.  The songs on the album span several years of writing (most of which were written in the last year—although, some songs have been featured on previous EPs, such as the title track of “Human Just The Same - EP"" and songs off of “The California Tapes”).I make music that I love, that I want to listen to, and that I am incredibly proud of, and because of that, I believe that some people out there might enjoy it as well.  I also believe that if I am going to ask people to invest in a product like this, they should know exactly what they’re backing—so, with that being said, I invite you to listen to the entire finished album…

“Writing is about a blank piece of paper and leaving out what’s not supposed to be there.”–John Prine
I am a constant student of this music, and I take what I create very seriously.  This sort of music is becoming harder and harder to find nowadays—it’s still out there to salvage, if you are committed to pursuing it, and that’s a process that tends to naturally weed out all but those that are the most devout to it.
The foundation of what I create is bonded together by the music of The Carter Family, Lead Belly, Roscoe Holcomb, Hobart Smith, Clarence Ashley, Dock Boggs, Charlie Poole, Uncle Dave Macon, medicine show acts like Frank Hutchison, Daddy Stovepipe & Mississippi Sarah, and nameless predecessors that carried these songs and tunes like sacred stone tablets in their minds.
Now, latter-day people and groups out there such as The Deslondes, Houndmouth, Dawes, The Milk Carton Kids, Gary Clark Jr., Leon Bridges, Benjamin Booker and many others have taken what they’ve needed from these traditions and contorted, warped and bastardized what didn’t for them—as has been the tradition since human beings first began playing music.
Performers such as Dom Flemons (previously of The Carolina Chocolate Drops) and Willie Watson (previously of Old Crow Medicine Show) have taken up the mantle of modern songsters to keep these songs and traditions alive. To that, I commend them.  But even those performers filter and embody that music in their own idiosyncratic ways, as all performers do.  Even so-called “revival” singers, such as Ramblin’ Jack Elliott, Dave Van Ronk, Pete Seeger, The Clancy Brothers, Josh White, the New Lost City Ramblers, Jean Ritchie, Doc Watson and Sonny Terry & Brownie McGhee were interpreting songs and tunes in ways that worked for them—as the “old-time” musicians, that they had placed so highly on pedestals had made alterations too.  You can’t escape the evolution of this music.  It is never static.  This music has never disappeared—sometimes it just blends into the backdrop a bit.
For myself, my life has been landmarked by moments of interaction with this music.  Whether it was seeing Taj Mahal as a kid, and not blinking while watching his right hand, or many years later, shaking the hand of Ramblin’ Jack Elliott, a man who embodies much of my own aspirations, it’s difficult for me to separate my life from the music. 
The many genres that sprouted from this fertile soil of American music have had major effects on me as well, most notably country, blues and jazz.  With country, what I take from the genre is mainly esthetics; instrumentation, the sonic landscape of the pieces, and even basic song frameworks (that is an extension of traditional music).  I owe a lot to people like Jimmie Rodgers, Hank Williams, Ernest Tubb, the outlaws; Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, Kris Kristofferson, Merle Haggard, and Willie Nelson for solidifying certain musical tropes, as well as providing incredible musical inspiration. 
Blues is an almost boundless treasure trove of material.  It’s a beautiful depiction of how far a genre can stretch over time.  It inspires awe to witness how one genre can facilitate the needs of artists for a century—spanning from acoustic artists like Charlie Patton, Blind Lemon Jefferson and Bukka White, through the stormy electrified chime of Chicago blues’ Howlin’ Wolf, Little Walter and Paul Butterfield.  Blues is more than structure, it’s a unified field of hymn that has energized folks longer than almost all other American genres.  Without blues, my and most others’ work would be near unrecognizable. 
What I take from jazz is, although not entirely ­– there are many aspects of the music that I have looted aurally ­– heavily based on the approach and attitude to the music that jazz musicians would take: improvisation, nothing is sacred, nothing sounds the same twice.  Over the years, these genres have proved to be three of the most malleable sects of music America has to offer. 
I know that I am looking for a niche group of people to back this campaign, but I have no intent of being able to be easily digested and processed by the mass public.  What I am looking to do is to blaze my own path, and to brand my own mark on music like others that have come before me, songwriters like: Tom Waits, John Prine, John Denver, Bob Dylan, Townes Van Zandt, Gordon Lightfoot, Buddy Holly, Chuck Berry, Todd Snider, Woody Guthrie, Robbie Robertson, Lou Reed, Tom Petty, Warren Zevon, Patti Smith, Captain Beefheart, Rodriguez, Steve Goodman, John Hiatt, Leon Russell, Stephen Foster, Nick Cave, Fats Domino & Dave Bartholomew, and Henry Thomas. 
I don’t know where my material falls on the spectrum of these giants that I cherish and commend, but I know that it is mine.  And I know that while I’m here, I only have interest in writing and singing the things that only I can create and conjure up.  So, that’s what I’m gonna do. The funds raised through this project will be going towards four aspects of creating and releasing the album.  The first two steps have been completed out of pocket, but my hope is that through this campaign, I can follow through with the rest of the album and create something tangible and incredible.1. Recording: The album was recorded at Dimension Sound Studios in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts, April 29th and 30th, 2017.
2. Mixing/Mastering: The editing, mixing and mastering for the album was done by Dan Cardinal at Dimension Sound Studios—Dan has worked with the likes of Lake Street Dive, Bruce Molsky, Tony Trischka and many others.
3. Manufacturing: A huge part of this campaign is raising funds for the creation of LP vinyl record copies of the album, as well as CD copies of the album and online distribution to places such as iTunes, Spotify, Apple Music, Google Play, Amazon and more.
4. Promoting: Funds for promotion can be utilized for anything from online promotion, via social media, to touring and more.
In exchange for your help, I've put together a really exciting group of rewards for your participation in this campaign!  Plus, every tier of perks come with an IMMEDIATE DOWNLOAD OF THE ALBUM!Along with the preparations being made for the album, I have also been working hard on creating my own independent record label, Roosic Records!  The hope is that Roosic will not only allow me full creative control over what I am recording and then sending out into the world, but also allow me, in the future, the ability to construct a platform for other songwriters’ works to be displayed.  Music is not only something that I make, but it is also something that I am constantly consuming and searching for.  The idea of building something that facilitates not only my ability to find and enjoy new, exciting music, but also allow others too, is very exciting to me.“All I want to do is just work.  I love the work.  It’s fun.  It’s really fun to do—to be able to perform and feel that communication, because you know that you’re putting out as much as you can, and there’s no doubt about that.”–Gordon LightfootThis album will have a major impact on me moving forward.  Having a full-length album of original material will help to open doors, not only to play at more venues, but also to allow me the opportunity to expose my music to more people.  If you want and can contribute to the campaign, just click the pink ""BACK IT"" button at the top of this page! Every little bit counts!""To me, when you need them, they appear. Your life doesn’t have to be in turmoil to write a song like that but you need to be outside of it. That’s why a lot of people, me, myself included, write songs when one form or another of society has rejected you. So that you can truly write about it from the outside. Someone who’s never been out there can only imagine it as anything, really."" –Bob DylanUp to this point, the major obstacle my music has been facing has been the funds to accomplish many of my goals.  This campaign is designed to allow me to pass those challenges and deliver a product I am incredibly proud of. “You put yourself in some kind of a trance in order to receive certain songs. You know, it’s like setting a trap for a song. It’s like fishing or anything else, you have to be real quiet to catch the big ones.” –Tom WaitsBeyond contributing to the campaign, you can help bring this album to fruition by sharing it with your friends!  And don’t forget the social media share tools above!  Thank you, and I can’t wait for you to hear this!-K.C.

<p>Now we’re ready to get into the next phase to complete the project which involves mixing; mastering; design and manufacture; song licensing fees; and publicity and radio promotion.<br/><em>A note about publicity and radio promotion:</em> this is not part of the making of a CD, but it is critical to any CD release. Without it, the music does not get out into the world. That is the industry wisdom and certainly has been my experience since I released my first CD over six years ago. My music career never would have come into being and the money we had invested in making the first CD would have been for nothing if no one could hear the music.</p>

</ul><p><span style=""font-size: large;""><strong>The Backstory: Nat and Me</strong></span></p>
<p>I’ve been working on this project for about two years now, but the story really began in the mid-1940s when I was a young teenager. At age 14, I knew—and sang obsessively, my Mother would say—every tune that Nat Cole and the King Cole Trio recorded. As a shy, self-conscious, tongue-tied adolescent, the only way I could talk to girls was to sing Nat’s ballads to them over the phone.</p>
<p>One day, when I was a student and member of the choir at Jordan High School in Watts (South Los Angeles), Nat’s Trio came to school. After their performance, they spent time in the choir room. I was excited, there with other members of the choir. I idolized Nat. But upon seeing him in person, I was so filled with awe that when he spoke to me and offered his hand I was too shy to even say hello, let alone shake his hand. Everybody just fell out laughing at my awkwardness and I was devastated.</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: large;""><strong>Who is Ed Reed?</strong></span><br/>    - or -<br/><strong style=""font-size: large;"">Why I didn’t make my first CD until I was 77 years old</strong></p>
<p>I’d like to tell you a little more about myself than there was time for in the video. By my junior year of high school, I was really turned off with school. I had good grades and a deep love of learning, but when I tried to get into the debate society, the counselor told me to go to shoe shop instead. That’s how it was in those days for people of color. Suddenly, it all became too much. I ran away from home and joined the Army.</p>
<p>While I was in the Army I discovered heroin, which became a 40-year addiction for me. I was in and out of prison four times in the 1950s and 1960s. During my last stretch, I sang with the San Quentin Jazz Band, a 17-piece jazz orchestra that at one time or other included jazz greats like saxophonists Art Pepper, Dexter Gordon, and Frank Morgan, trumpeter Dupree Bolton, drummer Frank Butler, and many others. I left prison for the last time in 1966 and then, for the next 20 years, I hardly ever sang.</p>
<p>I’ve always worked, even during the years of my addiction. And though I’ve worked at many things, the one thing the jobs had in common was helping others – even though I didn’t know how to help myself. I became a community organizer, trained by the Farm Labor Union and in the late 1960s, the War on Poverty helped me to find direction and purpose. I worked as a consultant designing prevention and substance abuse treatment programs – even as I continued to use drugs. I was constantly trying to stop using and I have been a client in about 25 drug treatment programs – detox, methadone maintenance, therapeutic communities, residential programs, 30-day inpatient programs.</p>
<p>Then, on July 8, 1986, I woke up and said, enough! I started going to 12-step meetings and am now approaching my 27<sup>th</sup> sobriety birthday. Since then, I have had an extremely satisfying career working as an educator with addicts/alcoholics and families in various inpatient and outpatient treatment programs. I have developed a 10-part series called “The Art and Practice of Living Well” that I use as the basis for my classes and workshops and which is constantly evolving.</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: large;""><strong>Getting to Live an Old Dream</strong></span></p>
<p>I began to sing publicly again in the early 1990s at little clubs and restaurants in the San Francisco Bay Area. In the summer of 2005, I attended Jazz Camp West in the coastal mountains of Northern California. The encouragement I got from the faculty there resulted in my first recording project released in 2007 (just before my 78<sup>th</sup> birthday), followed by two others in 2008 and 2011. In just these few short years, I’ve performed at internationally renowned clubs in New York, Boston, Seattle, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Bern, Switzerland, and just returned from a great week touring in Boston, Connecticut and NY in April-May with three members of my Nat Cole Project recording band.</p>
<p>My music has been critically acclaimed, reviewed in numerous jazz publications and other print media. My last CD was a DownBeat Magazine Editors Pick in 2011 and in four out of the last five years, I was honored in the Downbeat Magazine Critics Poll as a “Male Vocalist Rising Star.” You can imagine what a particular kick I get out of being a “<em>rising</em> star” at the age of 84!!</p>
<p>Even in the darkest days of my addiction years, I always believed that somehow I could have my dreams. I didn’t know how that would happen, but I knew it could and would. I must admit though that my debut as a recording and performing artist in my late 70’s was something beyond even my wildest dreams! And I have a lot more music in me too!!</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: large;""><strong>What You Get</strong></span></p>
<p>You can pledge as little or as much as you like and can afford. There’s a range of thank you gifts available, from pre-release downloads to signed CD to special mention on my website and a lot more. I’ll be posting some of the videos we filmed from our recent East Coast tour and will keep you updated on the progress of the campaign and the CD. If we do not make our goal, we will use the funds we do receive to continue finishing the CD and keep working at it until it is done. If we exceed our goal, we will put those funds towards the CD release tours we are planning.</p>
<p>I ask for your help in being a part of making this project a reality. Also, if you know anyone that you think would be interested knowing about this Nat Cole Project and participating in the process of bringing it to fruition, I would be grateful if you would pass along information/link about this campaign to them. I thank you from the bottom of my heart for spending some time with me.</p>

<strong><span style=""font-size: 120%;"">Answers to Questions You Might Have…</span> </strong>
<p><strong>Q: I know Nat King Cole. What exactly is the King Cole Trio?</strong><br/>Nat Cole put together the King Cole Trio in 1937. His group of piano, bass, and guitar was ground-breaking during the time of big bands. He was a great jazz pianist, and when he started singing and recording romantic ballads, blues, and jump tunes with the Trio, they became radio stars. His compositions “That Ain’t Right” and “Straighten Up and Fly Right,” inspired by one of his father’s sermons, made the charts in 1943 and 1944 and the King Cole Trio released many albums through the 1940’s. Soon after, Nat Cole left the trio format to perform as a vocalist with pop-oriented material for mainstream audiences, and was often accompanied by a string orchestra.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I thought “Unforgettable” was from that later time you're talking about, no?</strong><br/>You're totally right! That's the single exception among the songs. Nat recorded it shortly after leaving the Trio. I just really wanted to include it in this great collection of tunes.</p>

I began to sing publicly again in the early 1990s at little clubs and restaurants in the San Francisco Bay Area. In the summer of 2005, I attended Jazz Camp West in the coastal mountains of Northern California. The encouragement I got from the faculty there resulted in my first recording project released in 2007 (just before my 78th birthday), followed by two others in 2008 and 2011. In just these few short years, I’ve performed at internationally renowned clubs in New York, Boston, Seattle, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Bern, Switzerland, and just returned from a great week touring in Boston, Connecticut and NY in April-May with three members of my Nat Cole Project recording band.
My music has been critically acclaimed, reviewed in numerous jazz publications and other print media. My last CD was a DownBeat Magazine Editors Pick in 2011 and in four out of the last five years, I was honored in the Downbeat Magazine Critics Poll as a “Male Vocalist Rising Star.” You can imagine what a particular kick I get out of being a “rising star” at the age of 84!!
Even in the darkest days of my addiction years, I always believed that somehow I could have my dreams. I didn’t know how that would happen, but I knew it could and would. I must admit though that my debut as a recording and performing artist in my late 70’s was something beyond even my wildest dreams! And I have a lot more music in me too!!
What You Get
You can pledge as little or as much as you like and can afford. There’s a range of thank you gifts available, from pre-release downloads to signed CD to special mention on my website and a lot more. I’ll be posting some of the videos we filmed from our recent East Coast tour and will keep you updated on the progress of the campaign and the CD. If we do not make our goal, we will use the funds we do receive to continue finishing the CD and keep working at it until it is done. If we exceed our goal, we will put those funds towards the CD release tours we are planning.
I ask for your help in being a part of making this project a reality. Also, if you know anyone that you think would be interested knowing about this Nat Cole Project and participating in the process of bringing it to fruition, I would be grateful if you would pass along information/link about this campaign to them. I thank you from the bottom of my heart for spending some time with me.
 

Answers to Questions You Might Have… 
Q: I know Nat King Cole. What exactly is the King Cole Trio?Nat Cole put together the King Cole Trio in 1937. His group of piano, bass, and guitar was ground-breaking during the time of big bands. He was a great jazz pianist, and when he started singing and recording romantic ballads, blues, and jump tunes with the Trio, they became radio stars. His compositions “That Ain’t Right” and “Straighten Up and Fly Right,” inspired by one of his father’s sermons, made the charts in 1943 and 1944 and the King Cole Trio released many albums through the 1940’s. Soon after, Nat Cole left the trio format to perform as a vocalist with pop-oriented material for mainstream audiences, and was often accompanied by a string orchestra.
Q: I thought “Unforgettable” was from that later time you're talking about, no?You're totally right! That's the single exception among the songs. Nat recorded it shortly after leaving the Trio. I just really wanted to include it in this great collection of tunes.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary  <br/>
</h3>
<p>My name is Julia Anne Milin, classically trained operatic soprano living in New York City.  I am a native New Yorker who has been involved in classical music since I was a young child.  I started playing the violin at age 10, playing and singing in church.  At age 12, I was accepted to LaGuardia High School of Music and Performing Arts (TV's <i>Fame </i>school) as a voice student where my operatic talent was discovered.  From high school I went on for advanced training in the conservatory, and then to Europe.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I want to raise funds for a 9 song Classical music album, in a gentle style, using soft piano and strings.  The album will include songs from 19th century Germany, Sweden, France, USA, and New Zealand.  I will include 2 songs from American composer Stephen Foster, keeping the old tradition of American songs alive, as well as a beautiful Maori lullaby.  The Maori people are the indigenous people of New Zealand where I have traveled extensively over the last 2 years.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I need some financial backing because I have run out of my own money that I have put into the project.  I bought the technology required for this project including a Neumann microphone, music recording software, and computer upgrades.  I need your help to continue to produce this album slated for release in late 2013.  I have hired a pianist for the more intricate piano parts, while I have arranged and recorded the more tradition and simple tracks myself, <i>Hine e Hine </i>(Maori lullaby) and <em>Vem kan segla förutan vind?</em>, a lullaby from Sweden.<br/></p>
<br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need $2000 in order to finish the album.  In April of 2013, I had a disabling knee injury that took me out of the work force for 2 months.  I could not perform or work in a restaurant, my other source of income when I am not performing, because I had to walk on crutches.  I went back to work in June 2013, where I was able to earn enough money to purchase the required technology to start the lullaby album.  Now, I have been laid off for the season, and require a full time commitment to the album production to meet my release deadline by the end of 2013.</p>
<p>Your funding will help me:</p>
<p>Hire a designer to design the album cover</p>
<p>Rent an acoustic space where I can record operatic vocals with my studio microphone</p>
<p>Pay for CD duplication, including printing the album cover with jewel casing.<br/></p>
<p>Pay for online distribution on Spotify, iTunes, and Amazon.  Help to get m,y CD into storesIf you like the project, but are not in a position to help financially, please forward this campaign to as many people as you can.  Any help is appreciated and greatly needed.  Thank you so much!<br/></p>
<p>If I don't reach my entire goal of $2000, I will use whatever funding is granted to me to rent the acoustic space required for recording an operatic voice, and for CD duplication, the 2 most important requirements.</p>

<p>
</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><b>Why $25,000? </b>There are unique challenges and expenses when recording a large choir that increase the cost far beyond that of a recording for a small group. For example, did you know:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choirs of 50-150 people require recording space far beyond the capacity of a recording studio. This means renting acoustically suitable concert halls at $5,000 per day. A CD like ""O Yule Full of Gladness"" requires at least two days to record in concert halls.</li>
<li>Sound engineers require special recording equipment to adequately record large choirs, especially microphones that need to be properly place for stereo recordings. Sound engineers will cost between $2,500 - $5,000 for the raw recording, without post-production editing.</li>
<li>While choir members are not compensated for their recording time, the accompanists are. These professional musicians come together to rehearse before the recording and play during the recording. Paid hourly, the budget for musicians is $4,000 to have them get up to speed and record with us.</li>
<li>Post production sound engineering is required to take the raw recordings and make them ready for production. Estimated cost: $2,500.</li>
<li>Finally, the first production run will cost about $5,000 to produce the CD art and the first run of CD's.</li>

<p style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;""></p>
</center>
<center style=""font-weight: bold;""><h3 style=""color: #303030;"">Is FMGEM legal and are artists compensated?</h3></center>
<p style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">The answer is an unequivocal <b><i>YES</i></b>. As a matter of fact, not only does YouTube actively promote its <a href=""http://apiblog.youtube.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">public API</a> for developers to create sites like FMGEM, YouTube also places banner ads in its embedded player, so that creators can monetize those videos. FMGEM sees none of that money. 
<br/><br/>That is the profit motive for YouTube to open up its platform to developers. 
Additionally, YouTube <a href=""http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2011/08/youtube-signs-licenses-with-music-publishers-settling-lawsuit.html#sthash.Xq3SKLE9.dpuf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">inked deals</a> long ago with all the big labels to end any pesky lawsuits.
YouTube is also actively 
<a href=""//drownedinsound.com/news/4139440-youtube-launches-indie-music-partner-channel-artists-to-get-more"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">promoting indie artists</a>; providing an opportunity for indies to monetize their art. This is why FMGEM is proud to be ""powered by YouTube""; not to mention SoundCloud, DailyMotion, Vimeo and the Aol On Network.</p><p style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">Finally, SoundCloud, DailyMotion and Vimeo enable content providers to choose what is publicly available and how it is monetized. Most artists WANT you to see their content to gain greater exposure for their work and build their followings.</p><center><h3>Is FMGEM sustainable?</h3></center><p style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;""><span>Our business model is going to be freemium to premium. In other words, once beta is over and our mobile apps are complete FMGEM will be advertisement sponsored.</span></p><p style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;""><span>Users who do not subscribe to our ""Diamond Premium Service"" will see Google Adsense banner ads in their browser and on their mobile devices. Premium users will only see the ads we have no control over, namely the embedded YouTube banners and the ""pre-roll"" video ads in some DailyMotion videos.</span></p><p style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">This is how YouTube and DailyMotion monetize their API content and we are all for everyone being sustainable. That being said; we hope to be very profitable. </p><p style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">FMGEM has a secret weapon.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS


Is FMGEM legal and are artists compensated?
The answer is an unequivocal YES. As a matter of fact, not only does YouTube actively promote its public API for developers to create sites like FMGEM, YouTube also places banner ads in its embedded player, so that creators can monetize those videos. FMGEM sees none of that money. 
That is the profit motive for YouTube to open up its platform to developers. 
Additionally, YouTube inked deals long ago with all the big labels to end any pesky lawsuits.
YouTube is also actively 
promoting indie artists; providing an opportunity for indies to monetize their art. This is why FMGEM is proud to be ""powered by YouTube""; not to mention SoundCloud, DailyMotion, Vimeo and the Aol On Network.Finally, SoundCloud, DailyMotion and Vimeo enable content providers to choose what is publicly available and how it is monetized. Most artists WANT you to see their content to gain greater exposure for their work and build their followings.Is FMGEM sustainable?Our business model is going to be freemium to premium. In other words, once beta is over and our mobile apps are complete FMGEM will be advertisement sponsored.Users who do not subscribe to our ""Diamond Premium Service"" will see Google Adsense banner ads in their browser and on their mobile devices. Premium users will only see the ads we have no control over, namely the embedded YouTube banners and the ""pre-roll"" video ads in some DailyMotion videos.This is how YouTube and DailyMotion monetize their API content and we are all for everyone being sustainable. That being said; we hope to be very profitable. FMGEM has a secret weapon. FMGEM spent nearly three years developing a proprietary cloud based architecture on the Amazon AWS platform that is both infinitely scaling, zero maintenance and economical. So we believe when the world gets turned on to FMGEM our revenue model combined with our economical infrastructure will serve to keep FMGEM always growing and innovating.Who is behind FMGEM?Len Blumenthal, CEO: is an attorney and entrepreneur originally from New York City currently making his home in South Florida. Len is the creator, spokesman and visionary behind FMGEM.Cary Abramoff, CTO: is FMGEM's Systems Architect and Project Manager/Lead Developer. Cary is a Microsoft Certified Solutions Developer in .NET and has over 20 years experience as a consultant, architect and developer. Cary works behind the scenes to ensure FMGEM is always innovating and available to the world 365/24/7.FMGEM is a labor of love and we want to spread the message around the globe.

<h3>Who I Am!</h3>
<p>My name is Olmeca and I’m an artist and activist from Los Angeles.  I’ve been making music ever since I was a little one. My dad would take me to his rehearsals while playing in cumbia bands in Mexico and the U.S.  English is my second language. Hip-hop enriched my vocabulary and cultural experiences in the U.S. I’m in love with hip-hop and the betterment of my community.  My music marries the two; I have made it my life commitment to share creative expression to communicate through words, heart, mind, body, and soul.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Campaign</h3>
<p>Why is the title, “<strong>Brown is Beautiful</strong>?” As we know, the migrant community has been the center of attack by many.  This album celebrates not only the resistance against those attacks, but the people, the culture, and the spirit of determination. It celebrates the firm stance we’ve taken to exist and take our place in the world.  Latino America or Abya Yala is rich in history, culture, and diversity.  This album represents that spirit and is manifested through the music. </p>
<p><strong>Brown Is Beautiful</strong> Album is my 3<sup>rd</sup> full length independent release.  After conversations with record companies, I decided to continue my path as an independent artist.  By doing so, I keep my freedom of expression without creative constraints nor message censorship.  Too much in the world is happening for us to stay quite!  This is beyond politics.  It's about the human spirit and dignity! Cuidao'</p>
<h3>
<br/>You Are Extremely Important!</h3>
<p>By contributing to this campaign, you become part of a growing effort to push conscious music.  Through it, we are buidling a movement that engages communities in dialogue and build networks that strengthen their efforts.  Beyond the album, we are hoping to build a nation wide campaign addressing issues of migration, culture, and identity.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am 14 year old Olivia Bey.  I was born in Ohio and moved to Atlanta Georgia when the economy got bad.  It was in Atlanta that my music development started.  After two years in Atlanta we moved to South Florida for my Dads work.  Atlanta and South Florida have been very special in my development as a music artist.</p>
<p>My campaign to raise money is because of a very special opportunity I have to work with and be further developed by a Grammy Award winning producer and a top studio musician in Nashville.  I was granted this opportunity through someone that saw me perform in South Florida at a benefit concert.</p>
<p>Achieving the opportunity to go work with these individuals I believe will set my opportunities on a whole ne new path.  The kind of opportunity I have I do not is available everyday and is a real blessing.</p>
</div>
<div> </div>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>I am looking to raise $5000.  The funds will be used to pay the musicians and the producer simply for their time.  I will be working with musicians that are on most of the major records coming out of Nashville over the last 10-20 years, so it is a real bargain and a real opportunity.<br/>The unique perks of this situation are the caliber of people that are offering to take me under their wing.  It is that once in a lifetime opportunity!<br/>If all of the funds are not generated here I do have backup plans that will ensure that the opportunity goes through and whatever funds generated here will go towards the opportunity in their entirety.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people are not able to contribute and that is just fine!  But you can still be a powerful source for my opportunity.</p>

<p>Hi! I'm independent singer-songwriter Jetty Rae. I am an artist, a writer, and a poet. I am of the notion that words used succinctly can breach every wall, penetrate every heart, and express the noblest of joys along with the deadliest of sorrows. I am also of the notion that words sometimes fail me. Sometimes I can only express silence.</p>
<p>Over the past seven months I've been struggling to complete my latest album called Climbing Clouds. These songs are very emotionally charged, and when I sing them--I no longer just hear these lyrics and stories...I see them. I want to take you the listener on not only a beautifully rich audio journey--but a visual one. The power of film and cinema coupled with these five songs off of my new EP are going to be works of art. I would love to invite the listener into my world, of joy, pain and loss--to see what I intended you to imagine.</p>
<p>I am so thankful that I remain an independent artist, and fortunately I can still create my own music without fan support, but for this project my funds are not enough to cover my vision. I am dreaming big, and with your support we can make something truly beautiful and moving.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Our goal is actually lower than the cost of all of these music videos. The actual cost of pre-production, shooting, and editing would be somewhere in the ball park of $20,000. Thankfully my director John Paul and his team at Eleven35 Productions is willing to work with me because he see's value in my project. The money YOU give will be used to pay John Paul for his hours of story-boarding, location scouting, shooting and editing. It will also cover travel costs to Reno Nevada to shoot my video for ""Off The Grid."" Any extra funds made will be going to Eleven35, as well as my amazing Producer who has helped me create these songs for pennies! I am working with some very humble artists who believe in me enough to donate their livelihoods for fractions of the cost of what they usually charge. It's really important for me to pay them what they are worth--just because we are artists doesn't mean we should do things for free. You would never ask a dentist for a free visit, same with my director and producer. I feel very passionately about paying independent artists what they are worth--like myself they don't have major studios backing their projects, they are self-funded.</p>
<p>That being said, you have a unique opportunity to get some awesome perks if you donate! I am especially excited about the music video cameo perks! I think it will be a lot of fun for you to be on set, see what happens behind the scenes and then watch yourself in one of my videos! I'm also excited about the Skype concerts and house shows! The cover video perk is a lot of fun for me as an artist-I get to put my own twist on a song of your choice!</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Obviously I am very passionate about my music--and I want thousands of people to hear it. In this day and age nobody buys a full album anymore, it's all about the single. I am hopping that with these videos my music can break into the mainstream--and go VIRAL! Wouldn't it be cool for you to be a part of the journey that launches my career into the mainstream market? You can say you knew me when, and also take credit for launching my career to the world at large.</p>
<p>Fortunately I have been a singer-songwriter for the last 7 years, and over that time I have played in over 23 States! I have independently released four albums, and have gained the attention of entities like MTV, JetBlue, Sarah McLachlan and Lilith Fair. In the last year you also may have heard me singing on your television on Truvia's commercials! Honestly I am discouraged about the messages and music that is so popular nowadays. Nobody cares about substance and good writing--wouldn't you like to make that popular again? Wouldn't you like to support an artist who actually plays an instrument and writes her own songs? How much many of you download artists from iTunes who don't really care about their art...it's all about money to them. Don't be a mindless drone, support music that matters, and music that is alive!</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Spread the word. An independent artist like myself does all of the work! I promote, market, write, record, and fund myself. I will only reach my goal with YOUR help. Please share this campaign with business people, music lovers, and creatives in your world! Thanks so much.</p></div>","Short Summary

Nobody cares about substance and good writing--wouldn't you like to make that popular again? Wouldn't you like to support an artist who actually plays an instrument and writes her own songs? How much many of you download artists from iTunes who don't really care about their art...it's all about money to them. Don't be a mindless drone, support music that matters, and music that is alive!
Other Ways You Can Help
Spread the word. An independent artist like myself does all of the work! I promote, market, write, record, and fund myself. I will only reach my goal with YOUR help. Please share this campaign with business people, music lovers, and creatives in your world! Thanks so much.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hello my name is Anthony Sanchez, I am a dreamer from the heart of Bushwick Brooklyn, born and raised here for the past 30 years. I am now married with three awesome kids and although not many people would see this as a convenient situation I have found that the greatest source of my inspiration comes from my family. All of my resources and energy goes into making sure that they are okay and have all that they need on a daily basis. Recently I was taking a reflective look at my life and saw that there was an area that I was not using to it's fullest potential in order to make it a resource that was readily available to provide for my family. The area I'm refering to is my musical talents and song writing ability.</p>
<h2>Musical Background</h2>
<p>I have been a singer since I was 7 years old and a writer since I first picked up a guitar at 17... Yes I picked up my instrument very late in life but fortunately that did not take away from my passion for music or the dedication required to become efficient as a guitar player. I have had the privilege of having many great players as teachers and mentors like Brett Green my high school music teacher, Willie Brown Jr. (played for Toni Braxton and Alecia Keys in 2011) and amazing guitar player with a very big heart who lovingly calls me ""Antny"", Barry D a phenomenal jazz piano player, Eli Menezes (guitar, piano, bass, drums, keys), Dave Rodriguez (guitars, drums, keys, bass), Ricky Guadalupe (bass). Because of the goodness of God, I have been surrounded by so many great musicians that have all poured out a little bit of their musical knowlege, I have been able to develop my musical ability and writing to the point where I feel that I can be an asset to my community and hopefully the world.</p>
<h2>Campaign Funds</h2>
<p>Every penny of the money that is raised will be going into funding my latest project called ""Moments of Inspiration"". Funds will go to the purchase of instruments for the project, studio time, musicians that will play on the recording, production, mixing and mastering the project.</p>
<h2>Purpose of the Project</h2>
<p>As a kid I have always loved records that take you on an adventure within your soul. A record that, like a book, you could escape to in order to be relieved of all your troubles for the 12 or 20 minutes that the record lasted. As a teenager I found so much solace in those 20 minutes and many times I felt like those 20 minutes were 20 hours. Unfortunately, I have not found too many records that do that now a days so I want to bring that element back to the music industry and release a record that was not only sonically intreaguing but that will challenge you, the listener, to reflect on your life and ask yourselves the question; Is what I am doing now the best thing for me or for my family? Encouraging you, the listener, to do the things that you thought you could not do before. Like in the song titled ""Dreams"" which talks about not letting time pass you by while you stand idle doing nothing about your dreams and making them come to pass. I know that when this project is done it's going to be amazing and I hope that enough people get wind of it so that I can have a great influx of funds in order to do bigger projects. Like donating money to the people of Yerba Buena a town in San Jose de las Matas, a province of Santiago in the Dominican Republic. People live in constant poverty and children are living in conditions that are unacceptable by U.S standards. One of my greatest dreams is to develop a recreational center that could be self sufficient and stay open close to 24 hours. Where the kids of Bushwick can go anytime they wanted to if they wanted to hang out or play; a place where they could go to in order to stay clear of trouble. Here in Bushwick Brooklyn we don't really have a lot of places where kids can go to in order to be safe and just play without worrying about a stray bullet hitting them or being influenced by the drug dealers that sit in the same parks where I push my daughters on the swings. I would love for the opportunity to create that in Bushwick. It all starts with a donation for this project. In order to begin, what I hope will be a long and successfull career in writing and musical performance that will help bring all of my ideas and dreams to reality, I need the help and support of friends, family, aquaintances, co-workers, pets, insects, pretty much anyone who is willing to help. So please help me help my community and family but most importantly help me help as many communities all over the world that ""We"" possibly can.

<p>  Selah Gospel Choir was formed in 2007 by two individuals who had a vision for a multi-cultural, multi-generational, interfaith group of vocalists sharing a passion for gospel music. Selah has now grown in spirit and in number to 40 members from all over the Los Angeles area. Circling around central values such as love, diversity and community, SGC demonstrates these values as they sing for a purpose greater than themselves.  This vibrant, fun, and challenging ensemble strives to remain true and authentic to the traditional and contemporary gospel form of music.  </p>
<p>Enough of what we think, read the concert reviews from the community who we continue to touch and inspire:  </p>
<p>- ""fervent and poignant, emotive and bewitching"" </p>
<p>-""This group is uplifting, harmonious, and inspirational. That BIG sound they produce envelops the whole room. Selah Gospel Choir is colorful and beautifully enjoying the music they make together. They transported me to a sweet bliss.""</p>

  Selah Gospel Choir was formed in 2007 by two individuals who had a vision for a multi-cultural, multi-generational, interfaith group of vocalists sharing a passion for gospel music. Selah has now grown in spirit and in number to 40 members from all over the Los Angeles area. Circling around central values such as love, diversity and community, SGC demonstrates these values as they sing for a purpose greater than themselves.  This vibrant, fun, and challenging ensemble strives to remain true and authentic to the traditional and contemporary gospel form of music.  
Enough of what we think, read the concert reviews from the community who we continue to touch and inspire:  
- ""fervent and poignant, emotive and bewitching"" 
-""This group is uplifting, harmonious, and inspirational. That BIG sound they produce envelops the whole room. Selah Gospel Choir is colorful and beautifully enjoying the music they make together. They transported me to a sweet bliss.""
-""That choir had me dancing in the aisles!""

<p>Dearest Family, Friends &amp; Community, </p>
<p>I am so excited to share with you my first album of original devotional medicine music.  ""I Am That I Am: אהיה אשר אהיה"" is a collection of spiritual hymns &amp; prayers I have received over the years in Hebrew, Spanish, English &amp; Portuguese. These songs have been sung in ceremonies and ritual across tradition and are a gift to and from Spirit. This music brings me deep joy &amp; has gifted me with hope, inspiration &amp; remembrance on my healing journey.  My prayer is that this music, in some way, brings that to you too. </p>
<p>The creation process is already underway. I invite you to be a part of making this dream a reality!  </p>

<h3>Asinglewordisnotenough</h3>
<p>Hey there, my name is Seth Parker Woods and I'm a Chicago/NYC-based cellist, educator and movement researcher. First and foremost, thanks for taking the time to check out my Indiegogo campaign for my debut solo album.</p>
<p>Throughout my professional career as a cellist I've had the pleasure to work with some amazing artists as a side man, but the time has finally come for me finally release my own record after being urged by so many friends and colleagues.</p>
<p>This album is the culmination of 7 years of close collaborations with featured composers Michael Clarke, Edward Hamel, George E. Lewis, Pierre Alexandre Tremblay and Ge Gan-Ru. Each of the works presented on this full length album touches on various interests of mine with regard to interactive electronics, gestural mappings, transformations and translation, and I can't wait for you to experience it.</p>
<p>For this album, I'm fortunate to have Infrequent Seams (NYC) release it and have the help of Pierre Alexandre Tremblay (recording/production advisor), Christopher Botta (mixing and mastering), John Fallas (liner notes), and the lovely people at Clandestine Media (Album PR to help get the word out).</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>I'm hoping to raise $4,500 which will cover the costs of recording, mixing and mastering, pressing the album to CD, liner notes, and the publicity and distribution once it is released (November 18, 2016) to give wider exposure to this music and project which are so close to my heart.</li>
<li>Perks for contributing to the campaign include both digital and hard copies of the album once it is released, tickets to my USA album release show at Le Poisson Rouge in NYC in January 2017, and possibly a solo concert in your home by yours truly.</li>
<li>Regardless of the total raised, a humble contribution in any amount will be a huge help for me to cover the costs of realising this album.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Not only is the album a boost for my career, but it also serves as the first commercial recording featuring a work for cello and electronics for some of the artists. With your help, I'll be able to bring further awareness to these amazing collaborators and this music for cello, with hopes that other cellists will want to perform these pieces.</p>
</div><div><ul></ul></div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>For those of you that might not be able to help at this time, I would really appreciate it if you have a second to share my campaign with your friends, family, pets, enemies and colleagues who are music lovers and might be interested in helping me finally make this album a reality.</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I always dreamed of living in New York, study in the city, have the opportunity to play with some of the great musicians that live there, exchange life experiences and learn from them. Finally, after many trips and great effort, I was admitted at the prestigious Manhattan School of Music in a graduate program were the well-known professor David Starobin will be mentoring me. This marks the beginning of this new adventure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, all my willingness and compromise is not enough to carry through this great musical project. The university has awarded me with a generous scholarship, but the remaining tuition balance is still of high cost and out of my reach to finance. Additionally, the visa that will bee granted for my one-year stay in NYC doesn’t include a working permit. </p>
<p>
</p><p>For all this reasons I decided to launch this crowdfunding campaign where I could gather all the funds necessary to cover all the mandatory fees such as visa applications, health insurance, the remaining balance of the tuition, plus school materials (e.g strings, books, scores), rent and living expenses.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>This crowdfunding call-out comes from my deepest desire of wanting to keep learning and growing as a musician and artist. I trust that you can truly perceive and understand how important for my life and career this opportunity is. It’s the only reason why, with my best intentions, I ask for your support. I’m committed to guarantee that your contribution will have a valuable reward (see right column for prizes) and that I will continue following my goal of making a better world through music. Thank you very much in advance because your interest and cooperation will allow me to overcome this great challenge.</b><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> </b></p><p><b><a href=""http://www.federicodiazguitar.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.federicodiazguitar.com</a></b></p><p><i>ESPAÑOL</i></p><p><i>

</div></div>","THE NEW YORK CITY PROJECT(en español más abajo)ENGLISH



I always dreamed of living in New York, study in the city, have the opportunity to play with some of the great musicians that live there, exchange life experiences and learn from them. Finally, after many trips and great effort, I was admitted at the prestigious Manhattan School of Music in a graduate program were the well-known professor David Starobin will be mentoring me. This marks the beginning of this new adventure.

Unfortunately, all my willingness and compromise is not enough to carry through this great musical project. The university has awarded me with a generous scholarship, but the remaining tuition balance is still of high cost and out of my reach to finance. Additionally, the visa that will bee granted for my one-year stay in NYC doesn’t include a working permit. 

For all this reasons I decided to launch this crowdfunding campaign where I could gather all the funds necessary to cover all the mandatory fees such as visa applications, health insurance, the remaining balance of the tuition, plus school materials (e.g strings, books, scores), rent and living expenses.

This crowdfunding call-out comes from my deepest desire of wanting to keep learning and growing as a musician and artist. I trust that you can truly perceive and understand how important for my life and career this opportunity is. It’s the only reason why, with my best intentions, I ask for your support. I’m committed to guarantee that your contribution will have a valuable reward (see right column for prizes) and that I will continue following my goal of making a better world through music. Thank you very much in advance because your interest and cooperation will allow me to overcome this great challenge. www.federicodiazguitar.comESPAÑOL

Finalmente, y luego de muchos viajes y esfuerzo fui admitido en la prestigiosa Manhattan School of Music para realizar un posgrado bajo la tutela del renombrado maestro David Starobin, lo que marcó el comienzo de esta aventura. Para llevar a cabo este gran proyecto musical no alcanza con  mis ganas y mi compromiso. Aunque la universidad ha becado gran parte de mis estudios, es un emprendimiento muy costoso y lamentablemente no cuento con los medios para afrontarlo. Además, la visa que me otorgarán para mi estadía de un año en Nueva York no incluye un permiso de trabajo. Por todos estos motivos decidí iniciar esta campaña para recaudar los fondos necesarios para cubrir, por un lado, los aranceles obligatorios como la visa, el seguro médico, parte de la matrícula, así como también los gastos inherentes al estudio (partituras, libros, cuerdas, etc.) y los de supervivencia (alquiler y alimento). 
Esta convocatoria de ayuda nace de mi deseo más profundo de seguir aprendiendo y creciendo como músico y artista. Confío en que ustedes podrán percibir y comprender lo importante que esto es para mi vida y mi carrera. Por eso, y con mis mejores intenciones me atrevo a solicitarles su apoyo.

<b>Music As A Voice For Community</b><br/>
</div></b><div>
<p>Music's most powerful role lies within its ability to serve as a voice. That voice can carry a message to help inspire progress and change. For this reason, I've decided to dedicate my next album towards the Bowen Island Library. As such, all profits made from the sale of this album (from the 19th of July and onwards), will go directly towards the renovation costs of the Island's main library. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">With prominent BC poets, Jude Neale and Rachel Rose on board to recite one original poem each in the creation of a 5th and 6th track, the listener will have the rare opportunity to enjoy an authentically local and intrinsically Canadian work of musical art. </span></p>

<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Making the Album</b></p>
<p>To fund the album and ensure we can hand over several hundred downloadable cards to the Bowen Island Library and Gallery, as well as to several other businesses and organizations within Vancouver, I am asking friends, fans and family to help chip in by pre-ordering  from a menu of musical perks, to get this record financed. Thankfully, with early sponsorships coming in from Brock MacFarlane from CPS Mastering, Jonathan Fluevog from Vogville Studios and Justin Brown as the project's audio engineer, I've managed to keep costs low so as to warrant this as a complementary campaign in conjunction with the library's own fund raising plans. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>Funds Breakdown: </b></span></p>
<p>Studio Costs = $840 (discounted rate)</p>
<p>Audio Engineering Fees = $800 (discounted rate)</p>
<p>Mastering = $0 (sponsored) </p>
<p>1000 Paper Download Cards: $250 (500 cards just got sponsored!) </p>
<p><i>Rounds up to $1890</i></p>
<p><i><br/></i></p>
<p><b>The Team</b></p>
<p>A lot goes in to making a successful campaign, so I'd be remiss if I didn't mention a new member of our team. <b>Anne Marie Samarasinghe</b> is working hard behind the scenes to spread the word and book performances in order to reach our target. In fact, we're confident we can surpass our goal and hit $3000. Nothing would be greater than presenting the chief librarian not only with a whole stack of download cards, but with a cheque for $1000 to get their funding off to a solid start. That's right, every dollar that goes beyond the 2k mark goes straight to the library. Anne Marie, Jude and myself are all committed to making this happen. </p>

<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>The EP Release Concert </b></p>
<p>Around late June I will use the funds from this campaign to enter Vogville Studios with Justin Brown, Jude Neale and Rachel Rose to create the album. A Release Concert will be hosted at the Tir Na Nog Theatre on the 19th of July where I'll be performing the record live with Jude and Rachel. At the end of the concert, we'll then have the distinct pleasure of handing over several hundred copies of the album to Tina Nielson, chief librarian of the Bowen Island Library. </p>

</div></div>","Music As A Voice For Community

Music's most powerful role lies within its ability to serve as a voice. That voice can carry a message to help inspire progress and change. For this reason, I've decided to dedicate my next album towards the Bowen Island Library. As such, all profits made from the sale of this album (from the 19th of July and onwards), will go directly towards the renovation costs of the Island's main library. With prominent BC poets, Jude Neale and Rachel Rose on board to recite one original poem each in the creation of a 5th and 6th track, the listener will have the rare opportunity to enjoy an authentically local and intrinsically Canadian work of musical art. 



Making the Album
To fund the album and ensure we can hand over several hundred downloadable cards to the Bowen Island Library and Gallery, as well as to several other businesses and organizations within Vancouver, I am asking friends, fans and family to help chip in by pre-ordering  from a menu of musical perks, to get this record financed. Thankfully, with early sponsorships coming in from Brock MacFarlane from CPS Mastering, Jonathan Fluevog from Vogville Studios and Justin Brown as the project's audio engineer, I've managed to keep costs low so as to warrant this as a complementary campaign in conjunction with the library's own fund raising plans. 

Funds Breakdown: 
Studio Costs = $840 (discounted rate)
Audio Engineering Fees = $800 (discounted rate)
Mastering = $0 (sponsored) 
1000 Paper Download Cards: $250 (500 cards just got sponsored!) 
Rounds up to $1890

The Team
A lot goes in to making a successful campaign, so I'd be remiss if I didn't mention a new member of our team. Anne Marie Samarasinghe is working hard behind the scenes to spread the word and book performances in order to reach our target. In fact, we're confident we can surpass our goal and hit $3000. Nothing would be greater than presenting the chief librarian not only with a whole stack of download cards, but with a cheque for $1000 to get their funding off to a solid start. That's right, every dollar that goes beyond the 2k mark goes straight to the library. Anne Marie, Jude and myself are all committed to making this happen. 




The EP Release Concert 
Around late June I will use the funds from this campaign to enter Vogville Studios with Justin Brown, Jude Neale and Rachel Rose to create the album. A Release Concert will be hosted at the Tir Na Nog Theatre on the 19th of July where I'll be performing the record live with Jude and Rachel. At the end of the concert, we'll then have the distinct pleasure of handing over several hundred copies of the album to Tina Nielson, chief librarian of the Bowen Island Library. 





The Music
Ever since graduating from UBC I've been busking all throughout Vancouver, writing viola tunes on my Line 6 delay pedal. I've literally spent hundreds of hours bent over that shiny green box with viola in hand, composing and practicing for a living. Many of you have seen me outside the Cambie train station and on the board-walk in Coal Harbour. To date, five years have elapsed since I first began, and so its with a great sense of finality that I'll be heading back into the studio to seal the deal on these tunes.



Why I Chose A Cause 
It is my belief that music can and ought to play a pivotal role in community life. Too often, music gets regulated to mere entertainment or made for purely egocentric purposes. But music can be so much more than this! I want music to serve and transform the community by aligning disparate groups of people along progressive trends and towards common goals.

For this reason I deem the library's expansion an extremely worthy cause.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi! My name is Jennifer West, grade 4/5 French Immersion teacher. Over the last year, I've become more passionate about teaching piano. In addition, I've become discouraged by the number of families unable to afford private or group music lessons. I would like to offer students who can't afford it, the chance to study piano in my home.</p>
<p>One problem: I do not own a piano.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am looking to purchase a Kawai or Yamaha upright grand piano for roughly $3000 at either Long &amp; McQuade or Tom Lee Music in Vancouver.  Even the smallest contribution would mean a great deal!</p>
<p>The funds would go toward purchasing, tuning, and moving the piano to my home.  Once I have the piano, I would like to teach at least several hours per week, free of charge, to students who do not have the means by which to pay a private piano teacher. Rates in Vancouver range from $40 to $150 per hour for piano lessons.  Such a fee discourages children from enrolling. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The greatest gift that I received as a child, was music lessons. Through learning to play the piano, I gained confidence in being able to express myself and relate to the feelings of others. As an adolescent, music was a safe outlet for expressing my emotions and challenged me intellectually. The brain development that accompanies music lessons can not be understated.</p>
<p>I am humbled that my parents saw it fit to put their money toward my musical development. Since music is an incredibly huge part of my life and has brought me such deep joy, I wish for all children to have the chance to enjoy it as well.</p>
<p>Socioeconomic class should not be a hindrance to a musical education.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please let me know if you are acquainted with a family who would value from free music lessons. I have a few schools in mind that I will target to find pupils.</p>
<p>Also, if you have old piano books, I will gladly take them off your hands! </p>
<p>Thank you so much for your support!</p>

Our campaign needs funds in the range of $2000. The funds will be utilized for mixing and mastering of our album ""Guardians Of The Gate"". We've funded the recording of the album ourselves and have no other financial support to move forward with mixing and mastering. If we reach beyond our goal, all remaining funds will be contributed to performance travel expenses and promotion.

<div>Hello! Thank you to the (at this moment) 44 people who have contributed, 187 people who have spread the word, and 713 people who have enjoyed our campaign page! 55 more hours to go! The funds contributed thus far allow us to book precious creativity real estate: rehearsal space for the next several months as we continue to hone our sonic magic. The funds are also helping us to acquire high production value video documentation of our creative process at our workshops, performances, rehearsals, singing circles and pop up jams! </div>
<div>Unfortunately, we won't be at the Seattle World Rhythm Festival this weekend. However, we look forward to popping up in the beautiful city of Seattle at a later time. New Yorkers, save the date: we are performing at Silvanas on Wednesday May 27 at 8pm! We will post more dates as they unfold. Philadelphians, Berkshirians and Bostonites, DCians, Connecticutists, Jerseyites and beyond, stay tuned!</div>
<h3>WHAT'S THIS?</h3> <p></p>
<p><span>Lush Tongue is embarking on a tour to bring our uniquely immersive experience of vocal expression through music making! We are a women's a cappella ensemble based in New York City, featuring vocal improvisation and an eclectic, globally multicultural array of music from female composers. Each of us are artists and educators, with extensive backgrounds in music, performance and activism.</span></p>
<p><span><br/></span></p>
<p></p>
<h3>WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT?</h3>
<p>We revere feminine energy through sound, both spontaneous and composed. We sing songs from women composers both well-known and unknown, across all genres. There are well-known composers whose work is in our repertoire, such as Pura Fe and Cassandra Wilson. We are also passionate about imprinting the world with the hidden creative genius of women who may be less likely to claim the title of composer or lyricist: women like the Shipp Sisters, the two daughters of a farmer and a choir director who gave the first recording of ""See Line Woman"" to the Library of Congress in 1939; accountants and farmers and moms with lyrics buried in dusty journals, to be brought to light and given breath through our improvisational renderings. </p>
<p>We bring the wisdom and genius of women as creators, including our own original songs. The voice is a powerful tool for amplifying and empowering our deepest dreams and desires. We use our voices to delight, heal and open audiences to the power of their own words and sounds reflected back to them through vocal improvisation.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>WHAT IS THE IMPACT?</h3>
</div><div>
<p><span>In addition to traditional performance venues, we are bringing our unique immersive experience to non-traditional / marginalized spaces where the power of the voice as a tool for healing and transcendence can make a tremendous impact for grassroots organizations that do not have the resources to bring us on their own.</span></p>
<p>We need items for our tour package to ensure that: </p>
<p>a) we can accommodate the widest range of venues, including traditionally under-resourced schools, shelters, community centers and grassroots, volunteer-run  organizations.<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p>b) we can properly document the experience and share this valuable work with the world, and provide the kind of production value that demonstrates our commitment to revering feminine energy through sound. </p>
<p>The creative processes of female artists is profoundly under-documented. The overwhelming majority of Wikipedia artist entries are written about male artists. In a recent interview with the brilliant Icelandic musician Bjork, she noted the dearth of visual representation of women <i>creating</i> artistic cultural productions: women in recording booths, or writing lead sheets, or working on harmonies. We are honoring the voices that come through us, and the creativity of women all over the world. This is just the beginning, and we invite you to be a part of our journey every step of the way!</p>

He would pass away just two weeks after my return.I found myself wondering deeply why there seemed to be so much suffering in life, and what was really meaningful and true – I looked to nature for answers.I walked in solitude in Trinidad’s wondrous rainforests, I learnt about working with earth on a local permaculture farm, I dedicated time to studying with teachers of Trinidad’s many different spiritual traditions, and I devoted myself to meditation and contemplation, even living as a monk in an ashram for almost two years.All of my songs have come from this profound journey and are full of themes of love, hope, healing, and the exquisite beauty of our humanity – the celebration, the longing, the hopes, the heartbreak, the sweetness and the loss, the joys and the fears.My sound is deeply influenced by the life and vibe of Trinidad and Tobago – the breezy feeling of the beaches and rivers, the heavily rhythmic beat in all of our music, the celebration and sweetness in the eyes and hearts of the people. I have been writing and performing around Trinidad and Tobago since 2011. I have created an annual concert series called Gazebo Jam, where people gather outdoors under the stars to share in a magical night of music and inspiration. In 2013, together with my close friend Oliver Milne I won a national competition for a song and music video called “Lessons of the Forest” that speaks of the importance of caring for nature in order to have food security.In 2015 I released a demo CD with eleven (mostly home recorded) songs.I feel such a deep humble gratitude when I share my songs and people reach out to me with teary eyes and bright faces to tell me how much they were touched or inspired by my music. Moments like that make it all worthwhile, and it’s my dream now to share my songs with as much people as I can.This EP is the next step in that dream. Your support and encouragement means the world to me. Thank you!I love you! More Solman MusicFacebookInstagramYouTubeSoundcloud",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>~Our Story &lt;3</h3>
<p>Ok so maybe President Obama hasn’t heard of ~Nois (yet), but we ARE making our debut album and we need your help! This album will be a celebration of our time at Northwestern University — the birthplace of ~Nois. In the wee days of the group, we all took (and passed) a class with Hans Thomalla and his <i>Albumblatt II</i> was a central part of our first tour. Marcos Balter’s <i>Intercepting a Shivery Light</i> and Dave Reminick’s <i>Consort</i> were premiered on the same concert by the Anubis Quartet, all fellow Northwestern alumni and heroes of ours. During our time at Northwestern, we loved collaborating with our fellow students. Mathew Arrellin’s <i>Apertures</i> was the first piece ever written for us and Niki Harlafti’s <i>Vaisseau Fantôme</i> and Craig Davis Pinson’s <i>Dismantle</i> were written for our first performance on Chicago’s Frequency Series at Constellation. These incredible composers and their belief in ~Nois helped propel our ensemble in its early days. The supportive new music community of Chicago has welcomed us with open arms and inspired us to continue our journey. And you, our friends, have energized and encouraged us to to push ourselves and the boundaries of our art. This album will be a gift — a gift to these composers, a gift to Chicago, and a gift to you.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>~Down and Dirty Details</h3>
<p>We are recording the album with the incomparable Dan Nichols at Northern Illinois University. Dan is an incredible artist who has recorded some of Chicago’s finest ensembles and was the engineer for Third Coast Percussion's Grammy™ winning Steve Reich album. Once the recording is completed, we will be meeting with labels in order to find the best fit for our record. The projected cost of this album is $12,000. This includes paying for time in the studio, post-production, mixing, mastering as well as the costs associated with putting the album out on a reputable label. Label fees, including manufacturing and publicity for the record, are the biggest part of our budget. We have secured nearly half of our budget from our closest friends and family and now we need your help to make this project a reality. This campaign’s goal is to raise the additional $7,000 to support the creation and distribution for our album. Any funds raised over this $7,000 goal will go towards our future recording projects.</p>
<p>A donation of any size goes a long way to help us realize this goal, and we sincerely appreciate every single one of you who gives to this campaign. Through your generosity, you’ll not only receive all of the great rewards presented here (and come on, who doesn’t want this Frank shoutout?!), but you’ll become an indispensable part of our story.</p>

</div> <div> <h3>Why NEF Needs to Act in Solidarity with BB&amp;F:</h3>
<p><br/></p>
<b>Not Enough Fest </b>started in response to a notable lack of representation 
in the local Edmonton music scene. While our project was primarily centered around supporting gender diversity and queer representation, NEF
 also hoped to engage voices experiencing marginalization not only due 
to gender or sexual orientation but also because of racialization. 
However, all of the NEF 2015 organizers were white, and this was one (very 
important) aspect of our project where we were not successful. As white 
organizers, we recognize our limitations engaging communities of color 
in meaningful ways. We were limited in our personal connections to those
 communities, and the project itself was limited by the fact it was 
envisioned by a group of people occupying similar social positions and 
cultural backgrounds. NEF organizing taught us that, despite our best 
intentions and efforts,  those whom a project resonates with will 
inevitable reflect those organizing the initiative.<br/><br/>While we know
 we have a lot to think about moving forward with NEF 2016, we also know there are so many organizers and artists working to elevate the voices and experiences of IBPOC people in Edmonton that deserve support and recognition. <br/><br/>We know that the NEF community desires, supports and values a truly inclusive arts community. We are so excited to have the opportunity to act in solidarity with another project that is creating just that, and doing so in ways that NEF could not. We are confident that, together, we can harness the same energy, support and resources that were generated for us and are excited to share the allyship we received with the amazing organizers, artists, and communities involved with Brown Black and Fierce. <span style=""background-color: initial;""></span>

<li>We set up a competition that was successful for its seriousness and transparency</li>
<li>The competition involved young people from every continent</li>
<li>It drew together distant and different social realities</li>
<li>It brought to the fore little known musical contexts in a way never possible with a live competition</li>
<li>It offered scholarships obtained from the participation fees, and thanks to the generosity of the members of the jury and those who worked on the project</li>
<li>It gave worldwide visibility to the winners by publishing their videos on the most important social networks and then with the<i><strong> “Napolinova World E-Festival”</strong></i>, an online concert review that will include a performance by the winners of the 2020 Competition.</li>

<li>The first edition took place at a strange time, and despite the tragedy that affected everyone, it taught us that, if used honestly, the web can offer unique opportunities that are unattainable in any other way.</li>
<li>It can bring different worlds together, putting young people who unfortunately do not benefit from the same opportunities on the same level.</li>
<li>So we think repeating this wonderful experience with the same honesty and seriousness is the right thing to do, but offering even more.</li>

<li>20% of 90% scholarships for category A</li>
</ul><p><strong>TWELVE THOUSAND</strong> euros may seem like <strong>A LOT</strong> of money, but it is <strong>""ONLY"" 1200 citizens</strong> of the world who wish <strong>to support young artists </strong>by pledging <i><strong>""10 EUROS""</strong></i></p><h3> </h3><h3>To do this we are asking for help</h3><ul>

We set up a competition that was successful for its seriousness and transparency
The competition involved young people from every continent
It drew together distant and different social realities
It brought to the fore little known musical contexts in a way never possible with a live competition
It offered scholarships obtained from the participation fees, and thanks to the generosity of the members of the jury and those who worked on the project
It gave worldwide visibility to the winners by publishing their videos on the most important social networks and then with the “Napolinova World E-Festival”, an online concert review that will include a performance by the winners of the 2020 Competition.
Who was involvedInternationally renowned artists, residing in different continents, attracted by the motivations of the project, formed the jury ""World Piano E-Competition Napolinova 2020"" jury members Great talents but also young students, were offered the opportunity to be heard by great Masters, thousands of kilometers away, and, subsequently with the publication of their videos on social networks, by people all over the world.""World Piano E-Competition Napolinova 2020"" winners Why we want to set up the second edition
The first edition took place at a strange time, and despite the tragedy that affected everyone, it taught us that, if used honestly, the web can offer unique opportunities that are unattainable in any other way.
It can bring different worlds together, putting young people who unfortunately do not benefit from the same opportunities on the same level.
So we think repeating this wonderful experience with the same honesty and seriousness is the right thing to do, but offering even more.
What we want to createWe want to be able to offer substantial scholarships to the 2021 edition to truly help young people realize their dreams.Our hope is to raise twelve thousand euros (€ 12.000) with the help of all of you ""citizens of the world"", to create:
Scholarships awarded by the jury formed by international artists
Scholarships awarded by the ""POPULAR JURY"" formed by you, the donors
In particular, what you will donate will become:
10% scholarships (50% for cat. C - 30% for cat. B - 20% for cat. A) awarded by the ""Popular Jury""
50% of 90% scholarships for category C
30% of 90% scholarships for category B
20% of 90% scholarships for category A
TWELVE THOUSAND euros may seem like A LOT of money, but it is ""ONLY"" 1200 citizens of the world who wish to support young artists by pledging ""10 EUROS"" To do this we are asking for help
To the citizens of the world, because art and young people are everyone's heritage
To the great artists who have experienced the difficulties of youth 
To the teachers who see young people struggling, but realise that often, even when gifted with immense talent, they do not get the right opportunities.
But ""ESPECIALLY"" to the ""audience"", the motivation and meaning of every concert and inspiration and support for young people.To those who attend concerts and competitions and who with their presence, applause, and likes give “all the artists” motivation and inspiration, and “A REASON” to commit and dream.WE ALL CAN AND MUST DO SOMETHING MORE!LETS ""DONATE"" TO REWARD THE COMMITMENTOF THESE YOUNG PEOPLE.EVERYTHING YOU PLEDGE WILL BEDONATED TO THE WINNERS.The scholarships will be awarded with the same transparency and professionality as the 2020 edition.Anyone wishing to find out more about the 2020 edition and the young people who took part can visit the website www.associazionenapolinova.it  and listen to the winners on the youtube channel ""Associazione Napolinova""You can also listen to and support them by following them on the Napolinova facebook page""Napolinova World E-Festival 2020""In addition, to give participants more visibility and opportunities, other great Masters of international fame will join the 2020 edition jury.BUT TO DO ALL THIS WE NEED ""YOUR"" HELP!IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW MUCH YOU DONATE! EVEN A SMALL CONTRIBUTION WILL HELP! To thank you we will be offering rewards. You can choose one according to what you want or can DONATE ...Click on your chosen reward and follow the instructions.But you can also donate, and you will always have your reward,with PayPal to the emailinfo@associazionenapolinova.it writing for ""World Piano E-Competition 2021""orby bank transfer to:Associazione Culturale NapolinovaIBAN: IT97M0335901600100000001709 - BIC BCITITMMAgency 5500, Piazza Paolo Ferrari 10 - 20121 Milan (Mi) Italywriting in the description ""World Piano E-Competition 2021 WE HOPE YOU LOVE THIS PROJECT AS MUCH AS WE DO  THANKS FOR YOUR ATTENTION  WORLD PIANO E-COMPETITION 2021Il World Piano E-Competition Napolinova è un Concorso online organizzato dall' “Associazione Napolinova” in pieno “lockdown”, senza l'aiuto d'Istituzioni o Fondazioni, per offrire motivazioni a quei pianisti che, in quel momento in cui tutto sembrava fermo, continuavano a impegnarsi e studiare per costruire il loro “futuro” che è anche un po' il nostro.Chi siamoL'Associazione Napolinova è attiva da 25 anni nella valorizzazione dei giovani con Concorsi, Concerti e Masterclasses collaborando con artisti di tutto il mondo.La nostra sede è a Napoli (Italia) , patria della musica.Se vuoi conoscerci visita il sito www.associazionenapolinova.it Cosa vogliamo fareRaccogliere fondi per creare delle borse di studio da offrire ai giovani alla seconda edizioneCosa abbiamo fatto

Perché vogliamo realizzare la seconda edizione
Questa prima edizione, nata in un momento particolare, nonostante la tragedia che ha colpito tutti, ci ha fatto capire che, se utilizzata con onestà, la rete può offrire opportunità uniche e irrealizzabili in altri modi.
Può avvicinare mondi diversi, mettere sullo stesso piano giovani che purtroppo non beneficiano delle stesse possibilità.
Per cui pensiamo sia giusto ripetere questa bellissima esperienza con la stessa onestà e serietà, ma offrendo ancora di più.
Cosa vogliamo creare
Vogliamo poter offrire all'edizione 2021 delle grandi borse di studio per aiutare ""veramente"" i giovani a realizzare i propri sogni.
La nostra speranza è quella di raccogliere, grazie all'aiuto di tutti voi “cittadini del mondo” ,   dodicimila euro (12.000 €) per creare:

Borse di studio attribuite dalla giuria composta da artisti internazionali
Borse di studio attribuite dalla “GIURIA POPOLARE” costituita da voi donatori

In particolare quello che donerete diventerà:

per il 10% borse di studio (50% per cat. C - 30% per cat. B - 20% per cat. A) attribuite dalla “Giuria Popolare” 
per il 50% del 90% borse di studio per la categoria C
per il 30% del 90% borse di studio per la categoria B
per il 20% del 90% borse di studio per la categoria A

DODICIMILA euro “SEMBRANO” TANTO,

ma sono “SOLO” 1200 cittadini del mondo

che vogliono sostenere i giovani artisti donando ""10 EURO""
 
Per fare questo chiediamo aiuto

Ai ""cittadini del mondo"" , perché l'arte e i giovani sono un patrimonio di tutti
Ai ""grandi artisti"" che hanno conosciuto le difficoltà dei giovani
Ai   ""professori""  che vedono i giovani lottare, ma che spesso, anche se dotati d'immenso talento, non hanno la possibilità di avere le giuste occasioni.
Ma “SOPRATTUTTO” al “PUBBLICO” , motivazione e senso di ogni concerto e stimolo e sostegno per i giovani.

A quelli che assistono ai concerti, ai concorsi e che con la presenza , gli applausi, i like danno a “Tutti gli artisti” motivazioni e stimoli, e “UNA RAGIONE ” per impegnarsi e sognare.


 
MA tutti noi
POSSIAMO E DOBBIAMO FARE QUALCOSA DI PIU '
 “DONIAMO” PER PREMIARE L'IMPEGNO DEI GIOVANI.
TUTTO QUELLO CHE DONERETE
SARA 'DONATO AI VINCITORI.
Le borse di studio saranno attribuite con la stessa trasparenza e serietà dell'edizione 2020.
Chi vuole conoscere l'edizione 2020 e i ragazzi che hanno partecipato può visitare il sito www.associazionenapolinova.it  e ascoltare i vincitori sul canale youtube “Associazione Napolinova” 
Ma potete ascoltarli e sostenerli anche seguendo sulla pagina facebook di Napolinova il
""Napolinova World E-Festival 2020""
Inoltre per dare più visibilità, opportunità ed occasioni, altri grandi Maestri di fama internazionale affiancheranno nella giuria quelli dell'edizione 2020.
      Ma per realizzare tutto questo abbiamo bisogno del “vostro” aiuto!
Non importa quanto donerai!
Anche UN ""PICCOLO"" contribuirà aiuterà i ragazzi!

<p><strong>« Ici la paix », c’est quoi?</strong></p>
<p>Le Festival de la paix de Victoriaville est une initiative citoyenne qui vise à promouvoir la paix en soi et autour de soi pour un mieux-être collectif, une mission que l’organisme poursuit depuis sa première édition en 2010. Le festival s’est également tenu en 2011 et 2012, attirant de plus en plus de festivaliers, d’artistes, de conférenciers et d’intervenants de partout au Québec et même d’Europe venus partager sur des thèmes comme la santé, la famille, le couple, l'environnement, et la Communication Non-Violente (CNV), etc.</p>
<p>« Ici, la paix », c’est d’abord un projet collaboratif qui a pris la forme d’un recueil de citations qui ont les mêmes objectifs que le festival : créer la paix dans le quotidien des individus pour mieux influencer l’avenir de nos communautés. Le livre a connu un franc succès et est devenu un outil puissant pour le développement de la paix et d'autofinancement pour le festival.</p>
<p><strong>Ce dont nous avons besoin</strong></p>
<p>Le Festival de la Paix aimerait pouvoir publier son recueil de citations afin de le rendre disponible dans toutes les régions du Québec. Ce projet pourrait permettre, d’une part, d’améliorer la visibilité de l’événement dans la province, et d’autre part, assurer un certain financement à l’organisme afin de poursuivre son travail pour la paix. De plus, une plus large diffusion de ce recueil pourrait avoir un impact concret dans le quotidien de ses lecteurs.</p>
<p>La maison d'édition Véritas Québec nous propose d'investir 50% du montant nécessaire à la publication de l'ouvrage et à la distribution de celui-ci dans 240 points de vente au Québec (Renaud-Bray, Archambault, etc.). Afin de voir ce rêve se réaliser, nous sollicitons votre aide afin d’amasser les 4000$ dont nous avons besoin.</p>

Foozle Productions is an organisation aimed at developing,
encouraging, training and providing opportunities for young performers. This is
achieved through open mic nights, showcase concerts, school programs, and other
activities. 




The Impact

The Big Foozle compilation CD will give each of our 7 performers
a taste of what it’s like to be a recording artist, whilst also providing them
with a finished product that will get them started in the music industry. Each
performer will record an original song in industry level surroundings. Top line
studios, producer, musicians, mastering, photography, filming, and CD design.  




What We Need & What You Get

We need to raise $10,000 to get this project over the finish
line. The money raised will cover the recording, mixing and mastering of the CD,
as well as photography, design and production of the CD’s, plus filming and
editing video clips for each song. 


Should we not raise our goal completely the project will
still go ahead, but on a revised scale. If we go past our goal the extra money
raised will go towards further improving the quality of the CD, possibly even adding more songs!


The perks for your contribution amounts are listed on the
right of this page.

suitable for airplay on radio and if they agree it is, they will offer the

of the artist's release(s). Immediately after plugging, the artist has
real-time insight in which radio stations from which countries have downloaded
their release(s) for airplay.<br/><br/>
To my delight, <i>but to no surprise</i>, they loved her music and invited
me to create a profile on their site and upload her album for the A&amp;R
department to review. After reviewing the album, they came back with some
shocking news...they said her entire album is worth plugging; but since this is
a service that must be paid for, it makes sense to start with 6 songs. They
suggested plugging the following songs in the Pop, AC, and Easy Listening
genres:<br/><br/>
* I'll Never See You Again<br/>
* Reach the Sky<br/>
* Thinking of you<br/>
* I Wish I could fly<br/>
* Sweet Condemnation<br/>
** What people say (best radio track)<br/><br/>

<p>Hello friends :) <br/>My name is Nessa Rica Ramos, I'm a singer/songwriter from Sydney, Australia and I'm currently residing in the city of dreams - Los Angeles, CA.  <br/><br/>Back in 2008, I began posting videos on Youtube and doing small coffee shop performances. Choosing music as a career didn't seem like a valid option but merely a hobby.  This soon changed when I was fortunate enough to have been approached to record my original material.  My five song EP entitled, ""Hearts Desire"" was the product of that.  But since then, I have evolved and matured as a person and a songwriter.<br/><br/>God has blessed me with the gift of songwriting and I have come to appreciate the beautiful art of music - an art I would love to share. In Psalm 40:3 it says, ""He put a new song in my mouth, a hymn of praise to our God. Many will see and fear and put their trust in the LORD.""<br/><br/>However, any project - great or small involves expenses and this is where you can all assist.  I know, trust and believe that God will provide all my needs however, faith without actions is dead. And so I'm asking you - my family, my friends, my loyal supporters for help in any way that you can - prayers, thoughts, financial and physical assistance. </p>
<p><br/>Any amount will be helpful in making this dream a reality and all the money raised will go towards recording, producing and pressing of the CD, merchandise and promotion. I sincerely thank you from the bottom of my heart for all your love and support.   I can assure you that your support will turn into music that will last a lifetime. Thank you again and God Bless! :)  </p>

<p><strong><br/><br/></strong></p>
<p>Thank you so much for checking me out. I really appreciate it. My name is Utar Artun. I am a professional composer, arranger, film scorer, percussionist and jazz pianist. You may find detailed information on my official artist web page <strong><a href=""http://www.utarartun.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.utarartun.com</a></strong> (For Turkey <strong><a href=""http://www.utarartun.name.tr/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.utarartun.name.tr</a></strong> .)</p>
<p><strong><br/><br/><br/></strong></p>
<h2><strong>Why do I need your support?</strong></h2>
<p><strong><br/><br/></strong></p>
<p>I finished my 4-year Berklee College of Music education in 2.5 years with the highest honors and full scholarship awards. Now, I am accepted into one of the most prestigious music schools in the US: I got accepted into the New England Conservatory for a Master Degree and was awarded a scholarship to cover 35% of my tuition. I am really proud of this. However, the amount that I need to cover the full-time first year tuition is 25.000 dollars. With my current income, I’m only able to cover my rent, bills, groceries etc.. And I'm looking to you my friends, music fans &amp; enthusiasts to cover the remaining 65% and for your generous donations I offer you some creative prizes and perks.</p>
<p><strong><br/><br/><br/></strong></p>
<h2><strong>What are the Perks?</strong></h2>
<p><strong><br/><br/></strong></p>
<p>I am already very grateful for your donation. There are really special perks I have listed for you. You may check them out on the right side of the screen. They're all made up of creative and collaborative offers.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>What is the Objective?</strong></h2>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>It has been my dream to become a remarkable composer ever since I was a kid and right now I'm on the path to turn this dream into reality. With your help, I will be able to hone my skills and pursue even greater dreams and thusly - achieve them. With your help, we will put on great artistic, collaborative projects. With your help, I will make it.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>What is the Vision and Mission Statement?</strong></h2>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>I believe that my mission is to create music as a new unique insight in the future. With this in mind, through lifelong discovery, education, development and improved knowledge that I will share with people, through teaching and hopefully leave a significant legacy to the next generations. I want to create a futuristic understanding that consists of thoughts about human values and come into existence as an artistic intention. I am fully confident that the master of music education will contribute to these goals.</p>

<h2><strong>Neden desteğinize ihtiyacım var?</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>4 yıllık Berklee Müzik Koleji eğitimimi 2.5 sene içerisinde en yüksek onur derecesi ve tam burs ödülleri ile bitirdim. Şimdi ise Amerika'nın en köklü müzik okullarından birisi olan New England Konservatuvarı'na %35 burslu Master öğrencisi olarak kabul edildim. Bir yıllık eğitimim için karşılamam gerken miktar 25.000 dolar. Ancak şu anki gelirimle sadece kira, ev masrafları vb. giderlerimi karşılayabiliyorum. Geriye kalan %65'lik kısmı karşılamak için siz müzik severlerin yapacağı çömert katkılar karşılığında sizlere yaratıcı çalışmalar ve projeler sunuyorum.</p>

Yapacağınız bu yardımla, başaracağım...</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>
<br/><strong>Misyon ve Vizyon nedir?</strong>
</h2>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Misyonumun, müzik ilminde şahsıma özgü bir kavrayış yaratmak olduğuna inanmaktayım. Bu bağlamda; ömür boyu alacağım bilgiler ile kendimi keşfetmek ve bunu insanlarla paylaşmak, edindiğim bilgi ve deneyimleri öğretmek, gelecek nesillere önemli bir miras bırakmak, insani değerler hakkında fütüristik bir algılama ve kalıcı düşünceler yaratmak, ve artistik bir ekol olarak varolmak hedeflerim arasındadır.Benim için sanat, sınırsız bir algı meselesi ve bir gün benim bu sınırlı ömrüm bu sanatın bir parçası olacak. Eğitimsel amaçlar doğrultusundaki mental aydınlanmam, çevremdeki meslektaşlarım ile birlike yapacağımız ileri seviyede kültürel aydınlanma olacaktır.Müzik ilmindde öncü bir akademisyen olarak, gelecekteki öğrencilerimle bilgilerimi paylaşmak ve henüz denenmemiş projeler gerçekleştirmeyi hedefliyorum.

Why do I need your support?

I finished my 4-year Berklee College of Music education in 2.5 years with the highest honors and full scholarship awards. Now, I am accepted into one of the most prestigious music schools in the US: I got accepted into the New England Conservatory for a Master Degree and was awarded a scholarship to cover 35% of my tuition. I am really proud of this. However, the amount that I need to cover the full-time first year tuition is 25.000 dollars. With my current income, I’m only able to cover my rent, bills, groceries etc.. And I'm looking to you my friends, music fans & enthusiasts to cover the remaining 65% and for your generous donations I offer you some creative prizes and perks.

What are the Perks?

I am already very grateful for your donation. There are really special perks I have listed for you. You may check them out on the right side of the screen. They're all made up of creative and collaborative offers.
 
 
What is the Objective?
 
It has been my dream to become a remarkable composer ever since I was a kid and right now I'm on the path to turn this dream into reality. With your help, I will be able to hone my skills and pursue even greater dreams and thusly - achieve them. With your help, we will put on great artistic, collaborative projects. With your help, I will make it.
 
 
What is the Vision and Mission Statement?
 
I believe that my mission is to create music as a new unique insight in the future. With this in mind, through lifelong discovery, education, development and improved knowledge that I will share with people, through teaching and hopefully leave a significant legacy to the next generations. I want to create a futuristic understanding that consists of thoughts about human values and come into existence as an artistic intention. I am fully confident that the master of music education will contribute to these goals.

I have been singing ever since I can remember and it has always been my dream and passion to write and record my own songs that people would like and can relate to in one way or another. When I was 12 years old I started to write my own original songs and over the last couple of years I have<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> been very lucky to have been able to record some of them professionally in a studio.

<h3>Tunnel Club - an introduction</h3>
<p>Tunnel Club are two electronic musicians from Newcastle in the North of England - Steve Key and Graeme Stoker. We met at college in 1989 and our shared love of the emerging explosion in dance music brought us together. Over the years we've DJed and produced music individually but it was in 2015 that our music paths came together as producers as Tunnel Club was born. But why Tunnel Club? Well, back in our formative clubbing days, at the height of the rave scene, one club that we used to regularly frequent was called the Tunnel Club. We shared so many moments that helped define musically who we are in that place, and so it felt just right to nod back to where it all started for us.</p>
<p>Since Tunnel Club formed in 2015 we've been slowly but surely building up our work and our fan base. We've already released 6 EPs and a first album, both digitally and on CD, and have been bowled over by the support that we've had for our music. Described variously as ""old skool vibes"", ""retro sounds"" and ""IDM for the rave generation"", we produce what (we hope!) is timeless electronic music that is firmly rooted in our musical heritage but which absolutely looks positively to the future. We are not trying to make music that is in any neat genre pigeon hole: if it sounds good, and makes us want to move, then it's in!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1533761568/o3tk4us0munppm7qubvv.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>In addition to our recorded work, Tunnel Club is a live act, where we decamp our studio into a live setting, turning up the heat with a firmly dancefloor-focused approach that never fails to get people jumping. </p>
<p>In short: we are obsessed about electronic music. It runs through our veins, an ever-present influence in our lives and something that despite our advancing years never, ever gets dull. We are as excited to hear new music today as we were almost 30 years ago, and the buzz of producing and playing now is as strong for us as it ever was.</p>
<p>So that's the history...</p>
<h3>The campaign</h3>
<p>So why are we here in Indiegogo? As we said, we've already got a lot of releases behind us and we've been humbled by the support that we've had over the past few years from a growing and loyal set of like-minded music fans. But lets be honest: there is only one medium that is important in dance music. Downloads are great, and CD even has its place. But for real electronic music fans, the most important medium is, of course: VINYL. That beautiful black plastic, with its inimitable look, feel, smell, evoking memories of places and times for years after being bought, more than a passing file on a laptop or stream on a phone. Vinyl allows music to live and breathe, and to age and mature. Vinyl implores you to come back, listen again, re-live the moment and discover new elements that you maybe missed first time around, weeks, months, years later. For us, vinyl is the ultimate medium that music needs to be heard on, and that means it is where we want our best body of work to date to reside.</p>
<p>This campaign is to fund the production of our second album: Exit Space. The album is already recorded, and has taken two years to put together, with over 20 candidate productions being gradually narrowed down to the 7 final tracks that made the album. Mixing of the album is complete, and we've had the album professionally mastered at Blank Studios in Newcastle to make sure that the sound that makes it to wax is absolutely is good as it possibly can be. So, we're all set.</p>
<p>The crowdfunding element of this album, then, is effectively to fund the physical production of the records. This entails printing of sleeves and labels, the production of a lacquer (the master from which records are stamped), the actual pressing of the records, and the shipping costs. We have already sunk all of the costs to date, and the last step of this journey is literally to produce the final product. We hope that you are going to want to be a part of that.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1533906743/gu58ke4m2z9s0u0ys5nh.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>Want to get a sneaky peak of what's on the album?</h3>
<p>Of course you do! <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/tunnel-club/exit-space-album-sampler"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Click here to check out previews of all 7 tracks on the album</a>. </p>
<h3>What we need &amp; what you get</h3>
<p>So to the detail. We are trying to raise £1,200 to help fund the production of this album. Vinyl is definitely not a cheap medium to produce, but we believe - and if you've made it this far, hopefully you do too - that it is absolutely worth the cost. So with the money that we raise we'll be funding as much of the final production costs of the album as we are able to. If we don't make it all the way to our target our aim is to try to fund as much of the album as we're able to ourselves, with your contributions supporting that cost, but obviously it won't be as quick as we'll need to save up to do so! So your supporting us here will help to get this album produced as quickly as we can and to get our music out into the hands and onto the turntables of like-minded people all over the UK (and maybe beyond?..)</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1533849728/l3sbbi1o75pwoagenl3q.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We've already got all our steps in place for this work. Our mastered tracks will go to 100Vinyl in Paris, one of the best and biggest pressing firms Europe for small-runs. We aim to produce 100 records - the minimum amount it is possible to order. Our stunning artwork, already designed by Ricky Stiles, will go to the plant along with our track masters and they will take all of the components parts and produce them into the finished product which will be shipped back to us in bulk for us to then ship onwards to you. Simple!</p>
<h3>But I don't have a turntable!</h3>
<p>Worry not! All of our packages come with digital download, and in any case, we believe that music sounds better if you own the physical medium that it is produced on, even if you only ever listen digitally. So turntable or not, we really hope that you're going to want to own a slice of musical history, a physical manifestation of the music, one that will remind you for years to come of this collection of recordings; something that a bunch of MP3s on an old computer or a Spotify stream will never do..</p>

<h3>Exit Space: what to expect.....</h3>
<p>In June 2017 we continued our journey as producers by venturing into the live sphere, starting our own 'Northern Exposure' nights where we were keen to give some exposure to local electronic acts as well as honing our craft as a live entity ourselves. Buoyed by the response to our sets we discovered a new edge to the music we were producing in the studio: live performances were helping us to test, edit and reshape new tracks so they really sparkled once produced.</p>
<p>It became clear to us in early 2018 that we had enough material to start to put together this album. We had always planned for our second album to be a vinyl release, the only issue we had was whittling down our track list to the required length for a high quality vinyl press (Anything much over 40 minutes degrades the quality of your listen).</p>
<p>We have ended up with 7 tracks in total that have made the cut, and we have had some real soul searching conversations about which tracks should be on there. What we have now is a coherent and focused listening experience that we hope you will come back to time and time again.</p>
<p>The album starts with a slightly more downtempo vibe: opening track 'A Note To Say' shimmers and thumps whilst also using cello and piano, the vibe slowly building as 'Evolve' builds you into faster territory with some subtle acid and synth arps. The 3rd and 4th tracks move firmly into the signature Tunnel Club sound: 'Vanish Point' with complex percussion, some soaring pads and melodic bleeps before 'Infinite Orbit' (a recent live favourite) takes you on a journey into the atmosphere with a slowly evolving synth lead and bubbling acid finishing the first side on a high.</p>
<p>Side B continues the journey as 'Focus' builds like a skyscraper into a fierce stepped acid line backed by more frantic percussion, a perfect precursor to 'The Arch,' a euphoric track that closes with glorious arp lines that lift your mood ready for 'Time Dilation,' the closing track on the album, another soaraway melodic techno cut that got it's first airing at the recent Northern Electric Festival to a great reaction. </p>
<p>We are really proud of this collection of music and we hope you'll be proud to own it too. As an added extra, if you choose the CD tier of our campaign we will also include a bonus collection of music that almost made the album including more favourites from our first year of performing live. </p>
<h3>What can I get?</h3>
<p>We are super-excited about the package of perks that we've put together for you, and we hope that you will be too. You can see the full list of perks elsewhere on this page, but in short you can choose from various combinations of vinyl (all with digital download), bonus tracks CD, beautifully-printed A2-size poster and an awesome t-shirt exclusive to this crowdfunding campaign. Oh, and one final, mad perk which includes your own TC gig! We hope that there's a set of options in here that excites you and with perk prices from just £12 + postage, we've tried to keep everything really affordable.</p>

<p>The risks to this campaign are pretty low. We've already released a number of records on vinyl over the years pre-Tunnel Club, and so we're aware of the process and what can go wrong. We've already invested in professional mastering, and we'll be insisting on test pressing copies in advance of the full vinyl production to ensure that the audio quality of the pressing is absolutely perfect, therefore the risk of a poor pressing is mitigated by the test pressing. </p>
<p>Challenges are mainly to do with time. Pressing plants will not commit to a delivery timescale with an order of this size, and so we are at the mercy of their schedules and larger orders. That said, it is expected that the turnaround time should be around 3 months or less and as mentioned earlier, we are using a firm with large capacity  and multiple pressing plants to help mitigate delays. If we hit our funding target before the scheduled end of the campaign we'll be ordering the vinyl right away.</p>

<h3>That's all</h3>
<p>Hopefully we've been able to convey to you our passion for electronic music, and for our creative work as Tunnel Club. As anyone who has seen us perform live will attest, we are hugely motivated and excited by music and we love little more that sharing our passion with likeminded people. We've been fortunate to grow a loyal and growing band of supporters, and we hope that this crowdfunding campaign will help us to further extend Tunnel Club to a wider audience of electronic music lovers whilst delivering some really exciting physical items to all of our followers and friends.</p>

</div></div>","Tunnel Club - an introduction
Tunnel Club are two electronic musicians from Newcastle in the North of England - Steve Key and Graeme Stoker. We met at college in 1989 and our shared love of the emerging explosion in dance music brought us together. Over the years we've DJed and produced music individually but it was in 2015 that our music paths came together as producers as Tunnel Club was born. But why Tunnel Club? Well, back in our formative clubbing days, at the height of the rave scene, one club that we used to regularly frequent was called the Tunnel Club. We shared so many moments that helped define musically who we are in that place, and so it felt just right to nod back to where it all started for us.
Since Tunnel Club formed in 2015 we've been slowly but surely building up our work and our fan base. We've already released 6 EPs and a first album, both digitally and on CD, and have been bowled over by the support that we've had for our music. Described variously as ""old skool vibes"", ""retro sounds"" and ""IDM for the rave generation"", we produce what (we hope!) is timeless electronic music that is firmly rooted in our musical heritage but which absolutely looks positively to the future. We are not trying to make music that is in any neat genre pigeon hole: if it sounds good, and makes us want to move, then it's in!

In addition to our recorded work, Tunnel Club is a live act, where we decamp our studio into a live setting, turning up the heat with a firmly dancefloor-focused approach that never fails to get people jumping. 
In short: we are obsessed about electronic music. It runs through our veins, an ever-present influence in our lives and something that despite our advancing years never, ever gets dull. We are as excited to hear new music today as we were almost 30 years ago, and the buzz of producing and playing now is as strong for us as it ever was.
So that's the history...
The campaign
So why are we here in Indiegogo? As we said, we've already got a lot of releases behind us and we've been humbled by the support that we've had over the past few years from a growing and loyal set of like-minded music fans. But lets be honest: there is only one medium that is important in dance music. Downloads are great, and CD even has its place. But for real electronic music fans, the most important medium is, of course: VINYL. That beautiful black plastic, with its inimitable look, feel, smell, evoking memories of places and times for years after being bought, more than a passing file on a laptop or stream on a phone. Vinyl allows music to live and breathe, and to age and mature. Vinyl implores you to come back, listen again, re-live the moment and discover new elements that you maybe missed first time around, weeks, months, years later. For us, vinyl is the ultimate medium that music needs to be heard on, and that means it is where we want our best body of work to date to reside.
This campaign is to fund the production of our second album: Exit Space. The album is already recorded, and has taken two years to put together, with over 20 candidate productions being gradually narrowed down to the 7 final tracks that made the album. Mixing of the album is complete, and we've had the album professionally mastered at Blank Studios in Newcastle to make sure that the sound that makes it to wax is absolutely is good as it possibly can be. So, we're all set.
The crowdfunding element of this album, then, is effectively to fund the physical production of the records. This entails printing of sleeves and labels, the production of a lacquer (the master from which records are stamped), the actual pressing of the records, and the shipping costs. We have already sunk all of the costs to date, and the last step of this journey is literally to produce the final product. We hope that you are going to want to be a part of that.


Want to get a sneaky peak of what's on the album?
Of course you do! Click here to check out previews of all 7 tracks on the album. 
What we need & what you get
So to the detail. We are trying to raise £1,200 to help fund the production of this album. Vinyl is definitely not a cheap medium to produce, but we believe - and if you've made it this far, hopefully you do too - that it is absolutely worth the cost. So with the money that we raise we'll be funding as much of the final production costs of the album as we are able to. If we don't make it all the way to our target our aim is to try to fund as much of the album as we're able to ourselves, with your contributions supporting that cost, but obviously it won't be as quick as we'll need to save up to do so! So your supporting us here will help to get this album produced as quickly as we can and to get our music out into the hands and onto the turntables of like-minded people all over the UK (and maybe beyond?..)

We've already got all our steps in place for this work. Our mastered tracks will go to 100Vinyl in Paris, one of the best and biggest pressing firms Europe for small-runs. We aim to produce 100 records - the minimum amount it is possible to order. Our stunning artwork, already designed by Ricky Stiles, will go to the plant along with our track masters and they will take all of the components parts and produce them into the finished product which will be shipped back to us in bulk for us to then ship onwards to you. Simple!
But I don't have a turntable!
Worry not! All of our packages come with digital download, and in any case, we believe that music sounds better if you own the physical medium that it is produced on, even if you only ever listen digitally. So turntable or not, we really hope that you're going to want to own a slice of musical history, a physical manifestation of the music, one that will remind you for years to come of this collection of recordings; something that a bunch of MP3s on an old computer or a Spotify stream will never do..

Exit Space: what to expect.....
In June 2017 we continued our journey as producers by venturing into the live sphere, starting our own 'Northern Exposure' nights where we were keen to give some exposure to local electronic acts as well as honing our craft as a live entity ourselves. Buoyed by the response to our sets we discovered a new edge to the music we were producing in the studio: live performances were helping us to test, edit and reshape new tracks so they really sparkled once produced.
It became clear to us in early 2018 that we had enough material to start to put together this album. We had always planned for our second album to be a vinyl release, the only issue we had was whittling down our track list to the required length for a high quality vinyl press (Anything much over 40 minutes degrades the quality of your listen).
We have ended up with 7 tracks in total that have made the cut, and we have had some real soul searching conversations about which tracks should be on there. What we have now is a coherent and focused listening experience that we hope you will come back to time and time again.
The album starts with a slightly more downtempo vibe: opening track 'A Note To Say' shimmers and thumps whilst also using cello and piano, the vibe slowly building as 'Evolve' builds you into faster territory with some subtle acid and synth arps. The 3rd and 4th tracks move firmly into the signature Tunnel Club sound: 'Vanish Point' with complex percussion, some soaring pads and melodic bleeps before 'Infinite Orbit' (a recent live favourite) takes you on a journey into the atmosphere with a slowly evolving synth lead and bubbling acid finishing the first side on a high.
Side B continues the journey as 'Focus' builds like a skyscraper into a fierce stepped acid line backed by more frantic percussion, a perfect precursor to 'The Arch,' a euphoric track that closes with glorious arp lines that lift your mood ready for 'Time Dilation,' the closing track on the album, another soaraway melodic techno cut that got it's first airing at the recent Northern Electric Festival to a great reaction. 
We are really proud of this collection of music and we hope you'll be proud to own it too. As an added extra, if you choose the CD tier of our campaign we will also include a bonus collection of music that almost made the album including more favourites from our first year of performing live. 
What can I get?
We are super-excited about the package of perks that we've put together for you, and we hope that you will be too. You can see the full list of perks elsewhere on this page, but in short you can choose from various combinations of vinyl (all with digital download), bonus tracks CD, beautifully-printed A2-size poster and an awesome t-shirt exclusive to this crowdfunding campaign. Oh, and one final, mad perk which includes your own TC gig! We hope that there's a set of options in here that excites you and with perk prices from just £12 + postage, we've tried to keep everything really affordable.


Risks & challenges
The risks to this campaign are pretty low. We've already released a number of records on vinyl over the years pre-Tunnel Club, and so we're aware of the process and what can go wrong. We've already invested in professional mastering, and we'll be insisting on test pressing copies in advance of the full vinyl production to ensure that the audio quality of the pressing is absolutely perfect, therefore the risk of a poor pressing is mitigated by the test pressing.

<p>Local Deluxe began in the summer of 2016 when three friends decided they wanted to finally get together and create something original. Christian Sumalpong (vocals/guitar), Christian Delgado (bass), and Jose Cruz (drums) put their brains together to bring old and new ideas to fruition. With the help of Jordan Hardy (Fat Tofu/Binary Sunset/Marca Museca Studios), the band was able to record their self-titled EP! After Jose returned to California to finish college, Gino Datuin joined the ranks to fill in on drums. Released in May of 2017, the 4 track EP received favorable reviews from friends and family, as well as from new and emerging fans. Following the release, the band has played a number shows to familiar and fresh faces. As 2019 approaches, Local Deluxe aims to take it to the next level and tour in Japan. The tour is slated to go through Osaka, Kyoto/Nara, Kobe, Nagoya, Tachikawa, Shinjuku, Shimokitazawa, and Machida. </p>

<h3>Les Soumiaires</h3>
<p>Dans la vallée de l’hérault, au débouché des gorges de <strong>Saint Guilhem le désert</strong>, il y a le pont du diable qui depuis des siècles relie les rives malgré les tourbillons du fleuve, il y a aussi un <strong>pont imaginaire</strong> qui s’élance, <strong>entre oliviers et baobabs</strong>, pour rejoindre le pays du <strong>Siné Saloum</strong>, au <strong>Sénégal</strong>, et plus précisemment <strong>la ville de Soum</strong>, aux abords de la mangrove. Dans l’autre sens aussi, ce sont, à l’instar du bac qui traverse le Saloum, des liens qui sont tissés dans un aller/retour constant, un échange salutaire. Ces ponts et ces liens sont ceux que porte notre association <i>les Soumiaires</i>, entre un bout d’<strong>Occitanie</strong> (l’une des multiples cultures de France) et un bout du monde <strong>Sérère</strong> (l’une des multiples cultures du Sénégal). Autour de cet axe, nous l’espérons, peuvent s’ouvrir d’autres échanges, s’ancrer d’autres rêves de communication, de réseaux.</p>
<p> C’est au travers d’activités diverses que nous œuvrons tout au long de l’année :</p>
<p>-L’organisation de soirées contes (pour redonner vie à la parole populaire d’ici et d’ailleurs)</p>
<p>-La découverte de la cuisine sénégalaise lors de notre participation à des évènements culturels (préparation et vente de yassa poulet par exemple)</p>
<p>-La vente d’artisanat sénégalais</p>
<p>-L’organisation d’un festival de musique « actuelle », alliant musique africaine et musique occitane, au cœur du village de Saint Guilhem.</p>
<p>Une partie des fonds récoltés par notre association est investi dans la <strong>construction de classes au sein du collège-lycée de Soum</strong> qui manque de locaux pour accueillir ses élèves. Lors d’un récent voyage, des membres de l’association se sont rendus sur place et ont entamé un échange concret avec la communauté de Soum représentée par la commune, l’association des parents d’élèves, les professeurs, le chef d’établissement, la reine des femmes du village, le curé, l’imam et tous les villageois désireux de travailler à nos côtés.</p>
<p>Après deux ans d’existence, nous avons déjà financé, en mars 2017, la construction d’une première classe.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> Appel à financement:</h3>
<p>Afin de réaliser la deuxième édition de notre festival, en septembre 2017, nous lançons un appel à financement participatif. Ce financement permettra d’avoir la trésorerie nécessaire au paiement de la technique, des artistes et de la communication (affiches etc) pour cette soirée.</p>
<p>Cet événement porte le nom d’un lieu mythique de la commune de Soum, au Sénégal : <strong>An’na gar</strong>. Un refuge, un lieu de rendez-vous historique des habitants fuyant les envahisseurs et les esclavagistes. An’na gar : littéralement «celui qui sait où c’est, qu’il y aille », est donc notre cri de ralliement pour rassembler les gens en cette période trouble. À partir de là, de ce lieu (pour nous, le théâtre de verdure de Saint Guilhem le désert, aux abords de la célèbre abbaye médiévale et au cœur de l’écrin de verdure de la vallée du verdus), nous parlons donc à nos sœurs et frères du Siné Saloum, et plus loin, au monde entier.</p>
<p><strong>Rejoignez-nous</strong>, d’abord sur internet, en soutenant notre projet, puis bien sûr le 23 septembre pour faire la fête avec Mackou Seck (artiste sénégalais) et Djé balèti (artiste occitan) autour d’un bon yassa poulet et d’une bière locale.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Les groupes de musique:</p>
<p>Djé Balèti</p>
<p>Entre mystique carnavalesque et prière païenne, Djé Balèti est de retour avec son 2e album « Moko ». Lorgnant toujours plus loin vers l’Afrique via une Méditerranée réinventée, le trio toulousain marie les riffs chamaniques de l’espina, instrument niçois redécouvert par Jérémy Couraut, aux rythmes châabis, à la tarentelle ou au highlife, dans une transe fusionnelle furieusement primitive. Un mix détonnant qui ouvre la voie à une expérience musicale inédite, véritable passerelle entre le Nord et le Sud de la Méditerranée.</p>
<p>Makou Seck</p>
<p>Makou Madiop SECK est né au Sénégal. Issu d’une grande famille de griots (GAWLO), des orateurs qui maîtrisent la parole, l’éloquence et l’expriment par la voix et les instruments de musique. Cet héritage devient un atout et lui donne la capacité de se positionner comme auteur, compositeur, interprète, chanteur et danseur. Actuellement à Montpellier, Makou est un artiste complet qui joue une diversité d’instruments : les percussions traditionnelles (djembé, sabar, tama..), la batterie, la guitare. Il obtient le Prix : découverte musique du monde de Cherbourg fin 2010 dans la catégorie WORLD &amp; JAZZ. Son premier album « DOLIMA » sort en 2011 ; avec des titres chocs comme « Talibé » ou il exprime la vie des enfants mendiants voués à un triste destin.</p>

I continue to immerse myself in music everyday -- to practice, practice, practice. Not only is your contribution going towards a new album for you to enjoy, but it’s allowing me to continue the momentum I’ve built so far and to reach new heights. So let's make this happen together!If you're ready to contribute, just click the pink ""BACK IT"" button on the top right of this page! Every little bit counts, and we’re so grateful for all your support.If you've got folks in your network that would be interested in supporting us please help get the word out and make some noise!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hey guys,<br/><br/>I'm Anthony, but most just call me by my last name, Cubbage. I usually say I'm a folk/pop artist with jazz influence, but it's really not that easy to describe (find me on Spotify under ""Cubbage"" if you're curious). <br/><br/>I'm a multi-instrumental singer-songwriter from Philly, but feel most at home on the road, traveling, meeting new people, and hearing their stories. When I'm on the road, I continue a series called ""Songs for the Road"" where I write and record a song in a cool space I find, usually outdoors, and post the song on YouTube. I find that creating deadlines, and challenges sometimes helps those stories I hear and experience come out in a more organic way.</p>
<p>This last winter I was super motivated to start recording a second EP. Unfortunately I don't have enough funds to pay for everything involved in the recording/production process as well as the promotional costs that would take this release to the next level.</p>
<p>I know everyone thinks their music is important, and you might be like ""What makes this guys music any different"", but I think it's true that every music has it's place, that there isn't any bad music, as long as it's therapeutic and a catalyst for growth for someone. If my music's helped you already in some way, or given you a soundtrack for a night that helps you get loose, you can think of the contribution as an investment in more tunes that help do the same thing for you :)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>My Costs</h3>
<p>Okay, so I'm gunna be realistic that I won't raise enough to cover all costs, but let's do the math:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recording/Mixing - $900</li>
<li>Mastering - $250</li>
<li>Photography/Album Art - $500</li>
<li>Distribution (how it gets on iTunes/Spotify) - $124</li>
<li>Physical copy production - $552</li>
<li>Press/PR campaign - $500-2,000</li>
</ul>
<p><u>If I don't do any PR, the total costs are <strong>$2,326</strong></u>. The reason I'm asking for half of this is because I've been able to work off most of it so far, but now I'm living on the edge of my next paycheck which has been pretty nerve-racking.</p>
<p>Reaching the goal would help me finish paying Mark, the awesome mixing engineer on this project as well as afford some press so that the album can reach a little further than normal.</p>
