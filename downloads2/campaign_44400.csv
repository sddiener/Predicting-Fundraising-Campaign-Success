<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>There are many small things we need carry with us on a daily basis. Some of them are vital to keep our health in check. You don’t want a constant reminder that your well-being depends on your daily intake of meds that are carried in those pill pods that tells everybody that you are sick. We wanted to create a small watertight storage solution so you can confidently carry those essentials with you at all times in an inconspicuous way, and that's when<strong> iNA was born</strong>.</p>
<p>Its minimalistic and timeless design will blend beautifully with your outfit making it a must have accessory. If you don’t find anything to store in it, don’t worry, the quality and human validation of each piece results in an industrial container of such perfection that it can be used as jewelry. </p>
<p><i>It's made for travellers, adventurers, design lovers, titanium lovers, for you.</i></p>

<h3><strong>Design</strong></h3>
<p>During the prototyping phase we had a clear goal in mind: <i>Minimalism</i>.</p>
<p>These small Jewells are meticulously crafted using state of the art CNC machines and hand finished with the utmost care and attention to detail. The quality of the product is not apparent in what you see; it's in the details you can not see but that must be felt to appreciate.</p>

<h3><strong>Grade 5 titanium - Ti6Al4V</strong></h3>
<p>This material is widely used in the aerospace industry due to its exceptional strength and mechanical properties. Also, Frank Gehry, the acclaimed architect, decided to use it for the Guggenheim in Bilbao, a world-renowned art museum.</p>
<p>This has to be the coolest metal on earth and we absolutely love working with it. We have devoted ourself to learning on how to machine this exotic metal and that's why all of our products are available only in titanium. It is corrosion resistant, it is non toxic and non reactive, making them the perfect storage system when a degradation of their contents is not an option.</p>
<p>Let me highlight some of its benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is not much heavier than aluminum but it is harder than most steels.</li>
<li>It does not corrode.</li>
<li>It does not stain.</li>
<li>It does not smell.</li>
<li>It is paramagnetic.</li>
<li>It is food safe.</li>
<li>It is non-toxic and non-reactive. </li>
<li>It can be anodised.</li>
</ul>
<p>These small containers are virtually indestructible and they will last a very, very long time. </p>
<p>If you haven’t experienced the feeling of holding it in your hands, just give it a try. You won't see other metals the same way after owning your first titanium product. </p>

<h3><strong>Available in different sizes</strong></h3>
<p>The iNA containers are available in <strong>four different sizes</strong>. The cap which is the female part is only available in 15mm (0.59"") but you can find the male parts in 15mm , 25mm, 35mm and 45mm (0.59"",  0.98"", 1.38"" and 1.77""), combining both parts, iNA is available in <strong>30mm, 40mm, 50mm and 60mm</strong> (0.91"",  1.30"", 1.70"" and 2.09""). Choose the one that best suits your needs.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>
<strong>Watertight</strong> </h3>
<p>What!? With a cord coming from the inside of the capsule, no way! It may seem impossible but yes, iNA is watertight. We spent months working on it and we finally found a way to produce it  a . That's one of our goals and we didn't want to make compromises on this regard. Yes it might be a little overengineered for what it is, but I'm proud of what we achieved and probably this will be the container with an attaching point with the most minimalistic design you'll ever find.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>The inner seal</strong></h3>
<p>This piece fits perfectly inside iNA's cap preventing moisture and dust from getting inside keeping your essentials protected. No special tools are required to remove it from the cap, only a bent paper clip will suffice. Once removed, you will gain access to the cord from the inside, should you need to replace it and also to the included spare o-rings that are inside the cap, hidden when you don't need them but always with you when a worn-out or broken o-ring needs a replacement. </p>

<p>With the <strong>iNA DUO</strong> you get 2 iNAs of the same size.

<p>With the <strong>iNA SET</strong> you get all four iNAs, one of each available size. This SET is by far the <i>most popular</i> option and I can understand why. Once you have them with you, you can decide which one best suits your needs and order later some additional ones in case there's a particular size you use or need the most. It's showcased in a tin case with a custom foam insert.</p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://2664170-1.web-hosting.es/images/iNA/iNA_strong_loop.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p>It is available in more than 30 colors, perfect when you want to differentiate multiple iNAs or if you want to match colors with your outfit or your existing gear. But I've reduced the offering to the 10 most popular ones and also, because Indiegogo won't let me put more colors. :-). You can choose your desired color at the time of selecting your desired perk. If you choose a DUO or a SET you will be given the option to choose a different color for each one of your iNAs. All perks will include 50cm micro cord extra in case you want to resize the loop to a longer one or in case you need to replace the existing one.</p>

There are many small things we need carry with us on a daily basis. Some of them are vital to keep our health in check. You don’t want a constant reminder that your well-being depends on your daily intake of meds that are carried in those pill pods that tells everybody that you are sick. We wanted to create a small watertight storage solution so you can confidently carry those essentials with you at all times in an inconspicuous way, and that's when iNA was born.
Its minimalistic and timeless design will blend beautifully with your outfit making it a must have accessory. If you don’t find anything to store in it, don’t worry, the quality and human validation of each piece results in an industrial container of such perfection that it can be used as jewelry. 
It's made for travellers, adventurers, design lovers, titanium lovers, for you.

 
Design
During the prototyping phase we had a clear goal in mind: Minimalism.
These small Jewells are meticulously crafted using state of the art CNC machines and hand finished with the utmost care and attention to detail. The quality of the product is not apparent in what you see; it's in the details you can not see but that must be felt to appreciate.
 

 
Grade 5 titanium - Ti6Al4V
This material is widely used in the aerospace industry due to its exceptional strength and mechanical properties. Also, Frank Gehry, the acclaimed architect, decided to use it for the Guggenheim in Bilbao, a world-renowned art museum.
This has to be the coolest metal on earth and we absolutely love working with it. We have devoted ourself to learning on how to machine this exotic metal and that's why all of our products are available only in titanium. It is corrosion resistant, it is non toxic and non reactive, making them the perfect storage system when a degradation of their contents is not an option.
Let me highlight some of its benefits:

It is not much heavier than aluminum but it is harder than most steels.
It does not corrode.
It does not stain.
It does not smell.
It is paramagnetic.
It is food safe.
It is non-toxic and non-reactive. 
It can be anodised.

These small containers are virtually indestructible and they will last a very, very long time. 
If you haven’t experienced the feeling of holding it in your hands, just give it a try. You won't see other metals the same way after owning your first titanium product. 
 

 

Available in different sizes
The iNA containers are available in four different sizes. The cap which is the female part is only available in 15mm (0.59"") but you can find the male parts in 15mm , 25mm, 35mm and 45mm (0.59"",  0.98"", 1.38"" and 1.77""), combining both parts, iNA is available in 30mm, 40mm, 50mm and 60mm (0.91"",  1.30"", 1.70"" and 2.09""). Choose the one that best suits your needs.
 

Watertight 
What!? With a cord coming from the inside of the capsule, no way! It may seem impossible but yes, iNA is watertight. We spent months working on it and we finally found a way to produce it  a . That's one of our goals and we didn't want to make compromises on this regard. Yes it might be a little overengineered for what it is, but I'm proud of what we achieved and probably this will be the container with an attaching point with the most minimalistic design you'll ever find.

 
The inner seal
This piece fits perfectly inside iNA's cap preventing moisture and dust from getting inside keeping your essentials protected. No special tools are required to remove it from the cap, only a bent paper clip will suffice. Once removed, you will gain access to the cord from the inside, should you need to replace it and also to the included spare o-rings that are inside the cap, hidden when you don't need them but always with you when a worn-out or broken o-ring needs a replacement. 


 

 
Different package options
You can get a single iNA showcased in a small tin case with custom foam insert.

With the iNA DUO you get 2 iNAs of the same size. There are four DUOs available, iNA30 DUO, iNA40 DUO, iNA50 DUO and iNA60 DUO, which include two iNA30s, two iNA40s, two iNA50s or iNA60s respectively in the same tin case. This is a better deal if you need two iNAs, a very popular option amongst couples.

With the iNA SET you get all four iNAs, one of each available size. This SET is by far the most popular option and I can understand why. Once you have them with you, you can decide which one best suits your needs and order later some additional ones in case there's a particular size you use or need the most. It's showcased in a tin case with a custom foam insert.

The DUOs and SET reduces packaging and shipping costs and I'll pass those savings onto you, making them better deals if you are thinking on getting several units for you or to share with your loved ones. 


 

 

 




The Micro cord Loop 
The soft loop you see on top of iNA is a high-tech braided cord called micro cord from Atwood Rope MFG and let me tell you it is awesome.
I like the flexibility the cord gives you. You can adjust the loop the size you need. You can make the loop small enough to let a necklace fastener through or long enough to use the cord itself as a necklace.

It is very soft to the touch and it will not scratch your precious container. As an added benefit, it will not make chain rattling noises. It is only 1.18mm (3/64”) in diameter and it is surprisingly strong.

It is available in more than 30 colors, perfect when you want to differentiate multiple iNAs or if you want to match colors with your outfit or your existing gear. But I've reduced the offering to the 10 most popular ones and also, because Indiegogo won't let me put more colors. :-).

In Spain we have a saying that goes: ""Para gustos los colores"" which translates to: ""Everyone to his taste"". If you don't find your favourite color in the current offering, please don't hesitate to contact me.

The third is going to be used to store a list of my medications so that, should I need the help of an ambulance/paramedics again one day, they can see what my current meds & doses are and be alerted to my ‘existing condition’ - vastly improving my chances of survival as a hemiplegic migraineur. 
I love my little Nara & Yoko pods completely ? Thank you for making them ?

I received the package with the impressive Nara container (seriously – it’s a work of art).

Dara and Isami you guys did an amazing job on these and I'm so glad I got the Deluxe set! Shipping Canada was lightning fast! The precision of the machining is the best I’ve seen, the finish is beautiful and perfectly consistent. Love how the sizing and makers mark is on the inside so there’s no confusion as to which size is being handled but it’s still very subtle. The packaging and foam inserts are very well-done even with the thoughtful touch of a slot for spare o-rings. You guys truly went 110%. I would support anything else you put your name on in a heartbeat

Each and every single container will be made by us in our workshop in Barcelona. We have shipped over 1000 containers to more than 400 people in more than 40 countries. Producing the best products we can offer is our number one priority. With your help and support we can continue investing on new technology that will certainly improve the quality of our products.

Thank you so much for checking out this project.
Cheers,

<p style=""text-align: center;"">LUUNA, the first intelligent sleep mask that tailors its soothing capabilities to your sleep schedule. In today’s fast pace world, true relaxation is hard to achieve. LUUNA will give you the rest you need in order to be more fully awake for the things that matter most to you.</p>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1524802359/eohrg2bwpubts3wfizxs.png"" src=""""/></h3>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Whether it be to lull you into a nap or caress you into a full night sleep, LUUNA intelligently learns from your brain waves to produce music and sounds that are in harmony with your body’s rhythm, helping you fall asleep better and faster. </p>
<div style=""text-align: center;""> </div>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Above is s short sample from me. This might be the first Brainwave-AI Music you've heard. I do love the artificial intelligent music which reads my mind and knows what sound my brain need. When I'm sleepy, it won't wake me up and will naturally lull me to sleep. When I was in college, I was so eager to have a product like this that helps me have power naps every day. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Now I have it! I'm so refreshed and powered after the catnaps!</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""> Are you curious? How does it work?</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Below is the original EEG signals LUUNA collected for the first 6 minutes.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Based on above raw data, LUUNA's app drew the Sleep Curve and you can also see the Sleep Stages made according to the curve.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Below graph shows how music pitch reflects the sleep stages and match sleep status. When I was awake, the pitch is higher and denser than when I was drowsy and in light sleep. But it gradually lowered the pitch and slowed the pace to lead me to relax and sleep. The music differs person by person and time by time because every time the brain activity is definitely different.</p>

</div><div><h3> </h3></div></div>","LUUNA, the first intelligent sleep mask that tailors its soothing capabilities to your sleep schedule. In today’s fast pace world, true relaxation is hard to achieve. LUUNA will give you the rest you need in order to be more fully awake for the things that matter most to you.


Whether it be to lull you into a nap or caress you into a full night sleep, LUUNA intelligently learns from your brain waves to produce music and sounds that are in harmony with your body’s rhythm, helping you fall asleep better and faster. 
 
Above is s short sample from me. This might be the first Brainwave-AI Music you've heard. I do love the artificial intelligent music which reads my mind and knows what sound my brain need. When I'm sleepy, it won't wake me up and will naturally lull me to sleep. When I was in college, I was so eager to have a product like this that helps me have power naps every day. 
Now I have it! I'm so refreshed and powered after the catnaps!
 Are you curious? How does it work?
Below is the original EEG signals LUUNA collected for the first 6 minutes.

Based on above raw data, LUUNA's app drew the Sleep Curve and you can also see the Sleep Stages made according to the curve.

Below graph shows how music pitch reflects the sleep stages and match sleep status. When I was awake, the pitch is higher and denser than when I was drowsy and in light sleep. But it gradually lowered the pitch and slowed the pace to lead me to relax and sleep. The music differs person by person and time by time because every time the brain activity is definitely different.

For now, the music is mainly pop piano. But there will be more instruments and styles available. 


Let LUUNA help you fall into a deep sleep or simply recharge your mind and body with a quick nap. Whichever sleep mode you choose, Luuna is there for you.
SOUND SLEEP
Choose the sleep mode on your app to get you ready for a full night of restful sleep. Let LUUNA's artificial intelligence soothe you with calming music as you doze off into a peaceful slumber.
POWER NAP
LUUNA's app features a power nap mode just in case you only need a few short minutes to recharge your mind, energy, and help you boost your brain's learning capacity.
CONCENTRATION
Concentration training is much like weightlifting for your brain. This mode helps you master the ability to focus for longer periods of time.

LUUNA uses your brains own melody and intelligent AI to create a song to fit your mood. And when you do fall asleep LUUNA adaptively lowers the volume and fades out the music replacing it with the gentle sounds of nature.
By monitoring EEG signals, LUUNA is aware of when you’re in your deepest sleep and waits to wake you in your light sleep keeping that post-nap fog from clouding the rest of your day.


         EEG IS MORE ACCURATE 
 An electroencephalogram (EEG) is a test that detects electrical activity in your brain using small, flat metal discs (electrodes). Your brain cells communicate via electrical impulses and are active all the time, even when you're asleep. 
EEG monitoring is the most accurate and effective way to track brain activity sleep stages. Entertech has one of the most accurate EEG dry acquisition technology in the world and the most accurate algorithms for automatic sleep tracking and analysis. 

The LUUNA's app offers daily, weekly and monthly reports to show your sleep cycles and other data to understand your sleep patterns better and help you reach your sleep goals.
Free app available for IOS and Android devices

LUUNA’s high-tech design gives you up to 80 hours of battery life which makes it perfect to enjoy the many options that Luuna has to offer. Listen to your preferred music style with your earbuds, or connect your own speaker directly to your smartphone to relax the night away with soothing sounds.
Standby time more than 50 days!

LUUNA is only 50g in weight and provides you with a sense of security with special pinholes that you can peep through at any time.
LUUNA gives you the perfect light-shade because the 3D mask was specially designed to fit the contour of your face with skin-friendly fabric, making it extremely comfortable.
Did we mention that LUUNA can be washed? Just don't forget to detach the EEG sensor beforehand. Don't want to wash it? Buy an extra mask only for $19!



Naptime is our last product for which we also did a campaign on Indiegogo. Now LUUNA is ready to offer you the new experience of sleep and relax!






We are the Entertech team, and we focus on developing high-tech wearables for health, leading the way with dry EEG acquisition and ECG acquisition technology. Our R & D team consists of bioelectric data collection specialists from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou Dianzi University, University of York, and others.   
Up to now, EEG technology has entered into different application fields, such as healthcare, education, toys and games and so on. We are glad to cooperate with other companies and popularize the EEG technology with teams in relevant industries. Meanwhile, we will focus on mental health applications and launch a series of products around spiritual health like sleep, meditation, and relaxation etc. , which we believe will be more and more important.

1. Can I connect LUUNA with my Bluetooth speaker?
Definitely yes. Any Bluetooth you used before can be connected to your phone as usual. Bluetooth connection between LUUNA and app won't break your habit of listening music!
2. How can I wash the mask?

</div></div>","Radiomize’s gesture-controlled steering immediately turns any car into a connected car! With Radiomize, you’ll be able to enjoy a touch-enabled steering wheel cover, which is also accompanied by a personalized music and genre-based news discovery app, to provide a smart, fun, and safe connected car driving experience.
 
 
 

 

 




We know driving can be a hassle. The more you do it, the more tiring and frustrating it becomes. So, we set out to invent a smart steering wheel cover that would be the ultimate driving companion: Radiomize is that NEW driving experience (DX)! With a patented gesture-controlled steering wheel cover, which allows drivers to control their smartphones without taking their focus off the road, the driving experience (DX) will never be the same. 


  * For safety reasons, scrolling through messages can only be done when at a complete stop. 
 



 


 



The Radiomize app provides personalized infotainment for the digital age. This app creates a personal, dynamic and mood-based playlist that learns user preferences so that the driver doesn’t need to sit through songs and news that they’re not interested in hearing.






 

 




 

 



 


 




Radiomize is looking to reduce the risk of automotive collisions by preventing distracted driving. Through its simple yet revolutionary design and powerfully intuitive app, Radiomize’s goal is to keep drivers’ eyes on the road, hands on the wheel, and their focus directed on driving. 
 

 



 
 
 



   



Generic Steering Wheel
Generic steering wheels either have too many buttons, or none at all.
Many of us move our hands away from the generic steering wheel  while driving, causing dangerous distracted driving habits that put ourselves, passengers, and pedestrians at risk.
Maybe it's because the generic steering wheel is boring  and we want something fresh to keep us awake, and our mind focused on the road?
Maybe it’s because we want to stay connected  to the digital age?Or, maybe it’s both?
 Smart Gesture-Control Steering Wheel
Designed just for you, period.
Dress up your boring steering wheel with this revolutionary touch-enabled steering wheel cover, accompanied by your personal music collection and a news discovery app. 
The Radiomize wheel allows drivers to stay connected and while safe.
We call it “Drivetainment”.  Drive-time just got fun.",42.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3 align=""center""><strong>HOW WE BEGAN</strong></h3>
<p>After the February 26, 2012 death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, Adam Sweeney, like many Americans, discussed the incident with several of his friends. He discovered they all had something in common; they had been negatively stereotyped at some point in their lives. The stories of his peers inspired Sweeney. Upon further research, Sweeney found stereotypes were at the root of many forms of hostility between humans. He founded Stereotype Apparel in April 2012 and began searching for partners in the campaign against discrimination.</p>
<h3 align=""center""><strong>THE TEAM BEHIND THE NAME</strong></h3>
<p>At Stereotype Apparel, it really isn't about a political statement. We feel when someone is profiled and a tragic outcome is the result, there needs to be a change. We want everyone to be part of that change. While we are currently a small staff and new to the business world, we are dedicated self-starters motivated to making a difference in our own neighborhoods. We believe in combating negative labels with unity and a message of acceptance.</p>

<p>People pledge any amount and choose a reward. At the end of our Indiegogo campaign, if the combined total of all pledges for our project meets our $15,000 goal, then the credit cards of those who pledge are charged and we receive the funds to create the clothing line, minus a 4% charge from Indiegogo for hosting the campaign. If we exceed our $15,000 goal then the extra funds will be used to make the clothing line even better. Aside from a 4% Indiegogo fee and a 2-3% fee on each contribution for payment processing, all funds raised will be used directly in the clothing line creation.</p>

<p>If we don't meet our goal, then the money we've raised goes to help the company BUT we are charged 9% of the overall money raised. We know you won't let this happen!</p>
<p><strong>                                             CAN WE EXCEED THE GOAL?</strong></p>
<p>YES! We should be so lucky! Indiegogo will allow as much money as is given before the deadline. Even though $15k isn't something you'll find in your couch unless you're Mark Zuckerberg. (If you are, please donate to this. Thanks, Mark.) if 150 people give $100 donation, or less than $2 a week for a year, we hit our goal. We think it's totally doable, thanks to all of your help. 15K is bargain-basement for what we are trying to do, and more money would mean a greater chance to help others, which is what this company is all about.</p>

We think it's totally doable, thanks to all of your help. 15K is bargain-basement for what we are trying to do, and more money would mean a greater chance to help others, which is what this company is all about.
How do we contact you? Glad you asked! You can contact us directly at Adam@stereotypeapparel.com. We check it. We will get back to you. We promise!
                                   OTHER WAYS TO HELP: 
Spread the word! Tell everyone you know how awesome this project is. Share our schnazzy new website, like us on Facebook, blow up the Twittersphere talking about Stereotype Apparel and add our Twitter handle, blog it, or promote it any way you can think of. Everything helps!

THANKS SO MUCH FOR ALL YOUR SUPPORT OF STEREOTYPE APPAREL AND FOR HELPING US IN OUR CAMPAIGN!",4.0,0,"2 Campaigns

Created for business professionals,
students, designers, gamers, or just anyone with a laptop.ProtorypeIntroducing Sophi, the Made in Italy Mobile DeskSophi was born by an idea of Alessandro Costa, an italian web designer, for make more comfortable the laptop usage. The Sophi Mobile Desk it's ultra lightweight and comfortable, that's because we use light wood materials but very durable and strong.. The part of the table call ""writing zone"" it's composed by eco leather or a jeans material, and it can be used for writing paper, place objects or simply for place your hand. We decided to use the eco-leather and jeans because the materials are durable and beautiful to look and the quality is not as if we had done plastic.The holes along the surface serve as not to overheat a laptop because one of the major causes that do break it is overheating.Protorype
Perfect for laptops from 13"" to 17"".
Care to detailIn the space dedicated to tablet and smartphone there is a small hole that is used to route the cable of the battery, so that we can charge our devices even when we are using Sophi! We pay much attention to the environment, and for this reason Sophi is made with wood from certified and controlled forests. We have decided to use pine wood because it is one of the most durable woods that there are.Three different colors and three different materials to make unique your laptop!Classic Sophi

The timepiece exhibits the brand’s most uncommon traits, introducing remarkable additional elements such as the renowned SW 200-1 movement. Our designers and engineers have worked tirelessly to perfect this watch. In designing, we wanted to keep the watch functional and easy to read.The SeaBorne 500 M  is a great everyday timer that can be worn in any situation. It is built as robust as all forthcoming AUDRIC watches but has an elegant twist to it. For the desk divers, the watch enthusiasts, the explorers and the office goers alike, the SeaBorne is the perfect fit for people who appreciate the fine art of watchmaking and the beauty of intricate mechanics.  Various problems had to be solved as we scoured the watch market. We believe that we have SUCCEEDED in finding solutions for few of them. You can consider that the problems we faced were our motivation to create something unique. AFFORDABILITY: Not $1500. Not $1200. Not even $1000. Starting at just $600 on Kickstarter. Working direct to consumer, we pass the savings to you with radical transparency.PRACTICALITY: We wanted a quality handmade watch utilitarian enough for everyday wear. Simply, a no frills watch that just makes sense.DESIGN: Beautifully crafted for timelessness with a less is more approach. A classic look with extra detailing on the the multi layered Sandwich Dial.We wanted to create a unique design language for our flagship model and the challenge was to introduce creative elements which would bring out our thought process and convey the same to our patrons. Lots of permutations and combinations were contemplated in terms of designing of case, bezel, hands and bracelet. Our main aim was to provide a distinctive feel to the watch but at the same time keep it very utilitarian to the core.The design concept and the feel was finally perfected after many visits to the drawing board and spending innumerable hours of discussion in producing an automatic dive watch without any compromise on quality, functionality or the uniqueness. This whole journey of a concept to prototyping is completely dedicated to all those who have encouraged us.  The screw-down crown which is placed at the contemporary position of 3 o'clock is etched with the logo of the brand and filled with BGW9 lume for easy access at night. A helium escape value (HEV) located at 9h position, is a feature found on some diving watches. It provides functionality for professional divers operating at great depths for prolonged periods of time or under saturation. The Seaborne case is made of 316 L stainless steel which is also called as surgical steel. This is a high grade, metallurgically strong steel that has a greater resistant to corrosives – both of industrial and biological origin. Due to its effectiveness in high-stress situations, more specifically in contexts that present remarkable levels of acidity, it is highly appreciated in marine environments.  The Diver is created from a blend of angular aerodynamic surfaces and exceptional components. This makes the AUDRIC SeaBorne 500 M an elegant yet competent diver's gear.  The Case-back of the AUDRIC Seaborne 500 M has an engraving of a Sea Turtle which symbolizes strength, endurance and agility. Throughout history, many cultures adopted Sea Turtles as symbols for many different themes as well. Because of their long lifespan, sea turtles often symbolize patience, wisdom, endurance, and good luck. ... A turtle's shell is strong enough to carry the weight of the continent on its back, and with it their actual home. There is also a serial number engraved on each case back to make it unique.  ""000/000""   We have 5 different dials in this first line of SeaBorne 500 M timepieces:  A classy and highly luminous dial was of great importance, with a sandwich construction and generous layers of Superluminova C3 on the lower layer  and BGW9 filled indices.  The textured dial is made with great amount of attention to detail. The dial features raised (applied) polished hour markers and printed AUDRIC Logo. The hands are Rhodium plated which gives that extra shine and durability for longer years. The lume on the dial, hands, and bezel is a heavy dose of BGW9 that glows a blue all night long. The watch is absolutely free from harmful coatings like nickel. Dial also has color indicated depth gauge for visual reference. DIAL DEPTH GAUGE: Water absorbs different wavelengths of light to different degrees. The longest wavelengths, with the lowest energy, are absorbed first. Red is the first to be absorbed, followed by orange & yellow. The colors disappear underwater in the same order as they appear in the color spectrum. Even water at 5 ft depth will have a noticeable loss of red. At What Depth Underwater Does Color Disappear?Red - 15 feet, Orange - 25 feet, Yellow - 35 feetThe bracelet is 22mm at the lug and 20mm at the adjustable ratchet buckle. The buckle is milled out  and with 3 micro-adjust positions. The lug holes are screwed with high grade screw bars for easy removal of the bracelet. Solid endlinks for that extra toughness and balance. Satin Brushed and Polished links give an excellent aesthetic feel for this watch.The SeaBorne will ship in a black luxury box with warranty card, and extra spring bars. The AUDRIC logo is engraved on the buckle We wanted to use some of the best input materials on the market for this watch. Inside of the SeaBorne watches are the Swiss Made Sellita SW 200-1 which are hugely employed by the most renowned firms in the field of horology. They are very accurate and built to last for many years. The balance runs at 28,800 vibrations per hour and the movement hacks, comprising 26-jeweled bearings. They deliver a 38 hour power to the timepiece when fully charged /wound. This caliber is considered a workhorse by today's watch making standard. We used a Double Domed Sapphire Crystal Glass for the extraordinary mechanical properties it exhibits rather than the Mineral Crystal Glass alternatives seen in most watches. Five layers of anti-reflective coating are added to the underside of the crystal in addition to the double dome, ensuring a high degree of clarity and minimal light distortion and thus allowing you to get a clear view of the dial at all times, both indoors and outdoors. The crystal is 4.5 mm thick in the center and tapers down to 4.3 mm at the sides. This enables water tight setup for the watch at all circumstances.The bezel insert is made of sapphire, an extremely robust material that is higher scratch resistance, a “nearly indestructible” property, strength and superior longevity as opposed to the traditional ceramic, steel or aluminium alternatives. Despite the higher material costs, the choice was clear especially since we wanted to build the SeaBorne as a sport diver watch. The sapphire insert is engraved and filled with Swiss Super-LumiNova BGW9 pigment for excellent low/no light visibility.The 60-minute bezel is unidirectional (120 clicks) as per ISO/DIN specification for diving safety i.e. it won't accidentally bump down dive time. 
 SS 316 L case : 43 mm * 51 mm.
Case Thickness : 15.4 mm including the crystal.
Crystal Thickness : 4.5 mm.
Lug width : 22 mm.
120 clicks unidirectional sapphire bezel filled with BGW9.

<p></p></div>","What is ARSIM?

Sunlight is the fuel for all solar
power generation systems. Like any other power generation technology, knowing
the quantity, quality and reliability of the sun light is essential for plant
optimization and economic viability of a project.
ARSIM is a Rotating Shadowband
Pyranometer (RSP). This is an instrument that measures the solar irradiation as
measured in watts per square meter. A RSP uses a Pyranometer that is
regularly shaded to provide a reliable measurement of Global Horizontal
(GHI), Direct Normal (DNI) and Diffuse Horizontal Irradiation (DHI)

Target
The
 purpose of this project is to develop a new improved and more economical 
version of the existing
RSPs which are on the market. Following find the two main 
objectives:
Reduce the price considerably by improving manufacturing standard techniques.

Improve reliability and precision by new algorithms measuring transitory cloudy days.

Currently,
most RSPs are based on algorithms developed in the  90's, one objective of 
this project is to improve measurement algorithms and implement adaptive
 controls according to the type of weather.

Reduced uncertainty in solar resource of a
specific place is desirable in order to predict the energy production of solar power
plants. ARSIM is not only for companies, there are many colleges, scientists,
students and meteorology enthusiasts all over the world who are interested in studying
the solar resource in an affordable and reliable way. With advanced technical features and highly competitive
price, ARSIM will be a promising new product in the solar market.



Impact


ARSIM will make solar irradiation measurement affordable for more people promoting therefore more clean energy projects in the world.

<p>I wanted thank you all for clicking on my project and I appreciate the time you have taken out of your day to read my story. I wanted to create a company that stood for a cause and had a purpose. That purpose is to prove that the American dream is still alive, the dream that people can create something out of nothing and help others in the process.</p>
<p> So how did I arrive at custom shirting? </p>
<p> Being once a military guy and doing all those push-ups and sit-ups turned my body into a lean mean fighting machine. I have broad shoulders, a large neck and a trim waist. That mix doesn’t go well with standard off-the-rack clothing. It’s really frustrating when out of all the clothing companies that sell in America you can’t find one that makes clothes that fit you properly. I never wear ties because I can’t even button my collar. If I want a shirt that fits my neck, the material around my waist looks like a boat sail! The reality is most off-the-rack clothing companies don’t make shirts that fit men. Most are standard sizes they figured most men would fit into. The reality is that most men don’t fit into those sizes. If you’re trying to make a first impression you need to make sure you’re wearing clothing that fit. I know a lot of you men out there have the same problem with finding clothing that fits correctly like I do. You know what they say: If you have a problem don’t cry about it, fix it,” and that’s what I set out to do.</p>
<p>I went out and searched for a great American manufacturer. It took longer than I thought because I didn’t realize how much of our manufacturing base was sent overseas. There were many companies I found that claimed they were an American manufacturing company but their factories were overseas and this wasn’t going to cut it for me. Never giving up I finally found a shirting company in Newark, New Jersey who made all of their shirts here in America. I ordered a couple of samples and when I tried them on they were the best fitting shirts I ever wore. The first thought that came to mind was that these shirts felt like butter. Better yet I could finally button my collar and there was no sail billowing around my waist! I want every man to feel the same thing I felt when I put on that shirt for the first time. There is no reason why men in America should be walking around with shirts that don’t fit them because there is not a company out there serving their needs.</p>
<p>I am bootstrapping this company from the ground up and now to make this all happen in a meaningful way I need your support. Below is more info on the project. Thank so much for your time.</p>

</p>
<p align=""left"">The<i> <b>Seventy</b> <b>Five Member Package </b></i>will be popular with larger companies that
already realize the importance of rewarding their employees with an
“Appreciation” that is more important than taking them for a drink one evening
which is “not so cool now days”. Larger companies have already had the
motivational speakers at their facilities and have passed out the CD’s and the
books. Their employees have
read the books they have listened to the CD’s, and have seen the DVD’s. They
have paid heed to the thoughts of great authors, scientists, lecturers,
teachers and philosophers. Their words have inspired them. They have set
specific goals, objectives, and affirmations in their mind. Now they are ready
to change their life and achieve their goals using the Law of Attraction. The
secret is to stay focused on the positive images they have shaped by nurturing
them with constant attention until they become a reality. When they repeat
creative visualization of their thoughts and affirmations, their subconscious
mind will interpret these visions as what they wish to achieve and make real.
This process is the genesis of the Vision Coin.</p>

Seventy Five Vision Coin Packages





The Seventy Five Member Package will be popular with larger companies that
already realize the importance of rewarding their employees with an
“Appreciation” that is more important than taking them for a drink one evening
which is “not so cool now days”. Larger companies have already had the
motivational speakers at their facilities and have passed out the CD’s and the
books. Their employees have
read the books they have listened to the CD’s, and have seen the DVD’s. They
have paid heed to the thoughts of great authors, scientists, lecturers,
teachers and philosophers. Their words have inspired them. They have set
specific goals, objectives, and affirmations in their mind. Now they are ready
to change their life and achieve their goals using the Law of Attraction. The
secret is to stay focused on the positive images they have shaped by nurturing
them with constant attention until they become a reality. When they repeat
creative visualization of their thoughts and affirmations, their subconscious
mind will interpret these visions as what they wish to achieve and make real.
This process is the genesis of the Vision Coin.

Yet he continued, what if one placed the shoelaces on the side and left the
upper space completely empty for design. We decided to follow up on the idea
and tracked down a shoemaker in Munich, Germany. He confirmed that it would be
possible, structurally so we downloaded 3D Design shoe software and created

<p></p>
<p><b>Thank you in advance for checking out our Indiegogo page, we truly appreciate all the support.</b></p>
<p>The turbine geode watch was designed out of a love and passion for mechanical watches, and a disappointment at the lack of clean functional watches in the market place!</p>
<p>We noticed that prices were high due to marketing, branding, and expensive jewellery stores making many watches worth only a fraction of what they may cost.</p>
<p>So we decided to create our own brand of classic, functional and aesthetically pleasing watches. We are sure that you will love the Turbine Geode, our first design! </p>
<h1><b>When creating the Geode we wanted to ensure:</b></h1>
<p>1.     *  A classic design with modern functionality.</p>
<p>2.      * Using high quality materials</p>
<p>3.      * Affordability (keeping to under $300)</p>

<i>Black leather band option with double butterfly clasp</i><br/><p></p>In the design process we did not want to cut corners so decided on a classic 24 jewel automatic movement with toughened Sapphire crystal glass. <p>We have incorporated a glass porthole at the front and a sapphire crystal glass cover at the back so as to show off the lovely movement and included a 24 hour dial! We chose the Seiko made automatic movement of Japan as this gives great quality at an affordable price!</p>

</div></div>","The “turbine Geode” watch, is a fusion of classic styling,automatic quality movement, and good functionality at an affordable price!
We now have another range, a less expensive watch, see it at:www.igg.me/at/turbineclassic 


Thank you in advance for checking out our Indiegogo page, we truly appreciate all the support.
The turbine geode watch was designed out of a love and passion for mechanical watches, and a disappointment at the lack of clean functional watches in the market place!
We noticed that prices were high due to marketing, branding, and expensive jewellery stores making many watches worth only a fraction of what they may cost.
So we decided to create our own brand of classic, functional and aesthetically pleasing watches. We are sure that you will love the Turbine Geode, our first design! 
When creating the Geode we wanted to ensure:
1.     *  A classic design with modern functionality.
2.      * Using high quality materials
3.      * Affordability (keeping to under $300)


Black leather band option with double butterfly claspIn the design process we did not want to cut corners so decided on a classic 24 jewel automatic movement with toughened Sapphire crystal glass. We have incorporated a glass porthole at the front and a sapphire crystal glass cover at the back so as to show off the lovely movement and included a 24 hour dial! We chose the Seiko made automatic movement of Japan as this gives great quality at an affordable price!






Leather strap model with perforated holes for comfort


Stainless steel strap model



Sapphire Crystal glass front with porthole exposed mechanism!
A good quality all stainless steel strap with a double butterfly clasp. With the leather strap, again, a high quality strap with a butterfly clasp and perforated leather for comfort.(the images for the leather strap model do show a normal buckle on the strap, but will come with the butterfly clasp) The back is also covered in toughened sapphire crystal glass.




From the sketch.....

To the 3D cad image our manufacturer created for us.





Why we decided on the GEODE for our first watch.
like a beautiful geode rock, when exposed to the inside of the rock showcases its inner beauty, the GEODE watch has a porthole on the front dial and a sapphire crystal glass back cover exposing the fine mechanical movement and one of the 24 jewels.


Even in low light the chrome hands and hour markers are nice and reflective The hour and minute hands are also luminescent
The Geode Specification

* 21,600 vibrations per hour
* 24 hour movement dial.
* Case Size: 40 mm
* Lug width: 20 mm

* Glass front and back: Hardened Sapphire crystal
* Case Material: Stainless steel 316L
* Strap: 304 high precision stainless steel

<p><em>""They may not have the pre-reqs for high profile jobs but they are better than you or me when it comes to certain types of work.""</em> - Founder, Vocational Training Centre during a casual talk.</p>
<p>There are a lot of disabled people getting training in various sectors at different institutions or organizations. Vocational training centres in Karachi often teach disabled personnel computer skills, stitching, embroidery, painting etc. I have been to such centres and have seen the quality of training and caliber of the work of the most ignored segment of many societies. Instead of assuming that disabled people add to the economic burden of a country, we should see them as potential workers, contributing in full for their lives and of other's.</p>
<p>Moreover, there is abundance of women who are trapped in poverty and lack the skills to step out of it. During my field work for projects related to poverty in Pakistan, I came across a lot of unskilled women who were willing to work at the bare minimum wage just to financially sustain themselves. That is when I realized how much a platform to train and a good-paying employment can add to our society. These women are more than willing to get training and hone their skills to put them to economic use.</p>
<p><strong>Dou-Roshni is an initiative that seeks to train and employ the disabled and poor female workforce as major business drivers.</strong> The idea involves employing those people from vocational training centres to produce high quality traditional Pakistani handicrafts, internationally demanded clothes and jewellery. The traditional products include Embroidered Kurta (shirt), rali (wall-hangings, bedsheets, cushion covers, table mats), Khussa (shoes, slippers), decoratives such as mini rickshaws or trucks. The products will be available at an online shop for the world to buy. </p>
<p>Their employment will be conditional on the children in their families enrolling in and attending school regularly. They will be supported for education related expenses when needed from business profits.</p>
<p>Profit from sales will be reinvested into the business and will go towards specialized training of more disabled and poor people. As the project succeeds, Dou-Roshni will be a full-scale business with the same people in management (clerical) positions as well as production. This will be an excellent opportunity for those who fail to get jobs at par with others, to earn for themselves and even contribute to other's trainings and their own career development. It will give them all they need for a normal life. Plus, they will be making beautiful products for all to buy! :)</p>
<p>Dou Roshni means 'give light' in Urdu, the national language of Pakistan. It can also mean 2 lights: referring to the maker and the wearer of the products of Dou-Roshni.</p>
<h2> <strong>Dou-Roshni: Costing</strong>

And, a little about me:
I am Kanza Azeemi, an aspiring social entrepreneur, pursuing undergraduate studies in Economics at Lahore University of Management Sciences, Pakistan. I write for newspapers in Pakistan and Japan, and seek to use my writing to raise important social issues pertinent to developing countries. I have been awarded scholarships for exchange programs to Waseda University, Tokyo for a semester and to National University of Singapore for a summer program on 'Economic and Enterprise Development'. I won the Best Paper Award at SAESM 2012, Nepal. My research paper focused on the behavioral failures leading to the energy paradox in the energy-efficient lighting market in developing countries. I seek to give fashion a sustainable touch through my social enterprise, invest in human capital development and empower the underprivileged.

<h3>Stikk Gel Pad</h3>
<p>Stikk is a unique double sided thick core gel pad that will stick anything to everything! One single Stikk pad can safely hold any object up-to 350g (12.5oz), want to hold heavier items? Just use more Stikk Pads!</p>
<p>We found that finding ways of temporarily sticking objects to one another or other surfaces was an expensive and frustrating process and for the most part, the options were non-reusable, non-practical, looked bad and felt poor in quality or were simply not effective. </p>
<p>So thats when it occurred, what we needed was a thin and re-useable small pad that will stick to a huge range of objects, materials and surfaces, without being expensive or ugly, and so Stikk was born. </p>
<h2>Stikk Gel Pad</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1471956601/kos4vu25rhpthki7qxfk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>What we created in Stikk was the ultimate tool in sticking any small items to almost any surface. Stikk measures 7.6cm x 6.2cm x 0.3cm (3 Inches x 2.5 Inches x 0.1 Inches). Stikk is made from our own recipe of injection moulded Poly AB glue Plastic to create a material which is strong, flexible, sticky and re-usable, without being too hard, gluey or too soft like other similar products often are. Stikk can be pulled out to three to four times its size and it will return to its original size every-time. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1471956724/omtrues24owhxvyljvhj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>After several months of testing we came across a recipe that was the best all rounder. We found favouring some quantities against others did produce either a more durable but less sticky pad, or even a far stronger and sticky pad but far less durable and would last fewer uses. We found the best middle ground, a strong, durable, sticky pad that wasn't too much or too little of anything and was just right for everyday use! </p>
<p>Stikk is very durable and can be cut into smaller pieces to create smaller gel pads for your smaller sticky needs!</p>

<h2>How Stikk Works - The Special Stikk Recipe Explained:</h2>
<p>Our unique recipe for Stikk involves a simple yet delicate process. The Stikk gel pad is classed as a Polyurethane Gel Elastomer. There are 5 distinct aspects when creating the recipe for Stikk that we had to test in different variables to arrive at the recipe we now have. They are: the Prepolymer material (the 'A' side) and what is called the Curative (the 'B' side) hence the A B glue recipe we mentioned earlier. The prepolymer consists of an isocyanate (or an NCO) that reacts with the hydroxyl (OH) in the curative, which creates the adhesive qualities. The final three aspects and variables are: component temperature, substrate temperature (temperature of the mixture) and post-curing temperature. All the five processes and variables, were tested in as many combinations as we could, to find the best all round gel pad recipe for Stikk. It is a particular combination of all five of those aspects that create Stikk. By applying particular quantities of the prepolymer and the curative at varying temperatures, we found many different styles of adhesive could be made, and so, this is how we eventually came across the recipe for Stikk. </p>

<h2>Using Stikk</h2>
<p>Stikk is an all round great product for solving many everyday issues. Its also incredibly durable and will not damage your wall or car dash board! But as with most products, Stikk does have its limitations and we will explain these and tips on how you can avoid damaging your Stikk or objects and surfaces you use to Stikk with.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1471958003/nwiy038na6nbevrsvhxa.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2>Sticking &amp; Removing Stikk from an object or Surface</h2>
<p> To avoid damage to the object and surface that you are sticking to, and to make sure your Stikk pad lasts a long time, we advise using a Twist Then Pull method, as seen in our video. This will reduce the chances of the unlikely event your Stikk pad may damage a surface, object or itself.</p>
<h2>Temperature</h2>
<p>Stikk works great in almost all temperates, high or low without changing the way it sticks. We do however advise that you reduce usage in extreme temperatures either low or high. For example we would advise that you DO NOT use stick in temperatures bellow -16C (0F) or above 62C (150F). What this means is that Stikk will work in your hot car out in the sun in MOST PLACES in the world and will work outdoors in the cold in MOST cold places. But we advise you use caution in extreme temperatures. Stikk will not melt in high temperatures, but its effectiveness may change.</p>
<h2>Weight </h2>
<p>While Stikk is very strong and very durable, we advise caution when using stick. You must use common sense. If you are wanting to stick an iPad or Tablet to a wall for example to watch a film, 1 Stikk pad should hold up with no issues. But using two Stikk pads will ensure security and strength. Environmental situations can play a part in the effectiveness of a Stikk pad. If you live in a hot humid place for example, the surface may be more moist than you think, which will reduce the power of Stikk, so we would advise using two pads, especially on a larger object.    </p>
<h2>Surfaces</h2>
<p>As a rule of thumb, the smoother and shinier the surface, the better Stikk with hold. Stikk can be very strong on some surfaces while on others it can be very weak, again we advise you use common sense to avoid injury and damage to the objects and surfaces on which you want to hold. </p>
<h2>Cleaning</h2>
<p> The great thing about Stikk is that it is re-useable. But evertime Stikk is removed and re-used it can lose its stickiness and get dirty as dust, dirt and other contaminants get stuck to it. But all you have to do to get your Stikk Gel pad back to its glory is rinse it under warm water. Just run some warm water and hold the Stikk pad under the stream while lightly massaging it, this will help remove and stubborn dirt and dust. Then, once clean, simply leave to air dry on the top of the tap. We suggest not using a towel or drying the washed Stikk pad in anyway other than air drying, to make sure that it regains its strength.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1471958139/zsnywulgq7aparmxs66p.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1471958190/q39mwib2fghp1ku5qcfl.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We stress that unless Stikk is washed regularly after being removed from surfaces, Stikk will eventually lose its sticky characteristics due to dust and dirt build up. To avoid this, be sure to wash your Stikk pad(s) regularly to avoid damage and ensure a long life. We also stress that although Stikk can safely hold 350g objects, these figures are found in ideal household conditions. If you are using expensive items, we suggest using two or more Stikk pads, just incase the surface you are sticking to is less than ideal, this will help to reduce the risk of the unlikely occurrence of Stikk coming loose. </p>
<p>Should you have any issues or concerns after receiving your Stikk pad, we will be happy to hear them, to both, make sure you have a perfect experience using Stikk and so that we can work on any and all short comings (not that there are any ;) that we may have missed during the testing process for our recipe. We are confident that you will all have a great experience with Stikk, but we are here to help should any issues arise. </p>
<p>We hope you enjoy the idea and uses for Stikk Gel pads and will want to join us on our mission to make them a reality. If you have any questions, just leave them in the comments section so everyone can see and we will make sure to get back to you as soon as we can. </p>

Stikk is a unique double sided thick core gel pad that will stick anything to everything! One single Stikk pad can safely hold any object up-to 350g (12.5oz), want to hold heavier items? Just use more Stikk Pads!
We found that finding ways of temporarily sticking objects to one another or other surfaces was an expensive and frustrating process and for the most part, the options were non-reusable, non-practical, looked bad and felt poor in quality or were simply not effective. 
So thats when it occurred, what we needed was a thin and re-useable small pad that will stick to a huge range of objects, materials and surfaces, without being expensive or ugly, and so Stikk was born. 
Stikk Gel Pad

What we created in Stikk was the ultimate tool in sticking any small items to almost any surface. Stikk measures 7.6cm x 6.2cm x 0.3cm (3 Inches x 2.5 Inches x 0.1 Inches). Stikk is made from our own recipe of injection moulded Poly AB glue Plastic to create a material which is strong, flexible, sticky and re-usable, without being too hard, gluey or too soft like other similar products often are. Stikk can be pulled out to three to four times its size and it will return to its original size every-time. 

After several months of testing we came across a recipe that was the best all rounder. We found favouring some quantities against others did produce either a more durable but less sticky pad, or even a far stronger and sticky pad but far less durable and would last fewer uses. We found the best middle ground, a strong, durable, sticky pad that wasn't too much or too little of anything and was just right for everyday use! 
Stikk is very durable and can be cut into smaller pieces to create smaller gel pads for your smaller sticky needs!

Cut Stikk Into Smaller Pieces

 
How Stikk Works - The Special Stikk Recipe Explained:
Our unique recipe for Stikk involves a simple yet delicate process. The Stikk gel pad is classed as a Polyurethane Gel Elastomer. There are 5 distinct aspects when creating the recipe for Stikk that we had to test in different variables to arrive at the recipe we now have. They are: the Prepolymer material (the 'A' side) and what is called the Curative (the 'B' side) hence the A B glue recipe we mentioned earlier. The prepolymer consists of an isocyanate (or an NCO) that reacts with the hydroxyl (OH) in the curative, which creates the adhesive qualities. The final three aspects and variables are: component temperature, substrate temperature (temperature of the mixture) and post-curing temperature. All the five processes and variables, were tested in as many combinations as we could, to find the best all round gel pad recipe for Stikk. It is a particular combination of all five of those aspects that create Stikk. By applying particular quantities of the prepolymer and the curative at varying temperatures, we found many different styles of adhesive could be made, and so, this is how we eventually came across the recipe for Stikk.

That doesn't even scratch the surface! The possibilities are endless! How will you use Stikk to transform your life? 

 













Using Stikk
Stikk is an all round great product for solving many everyday issues. Its also incredibly durable and will not damage your wall or car dash board! But as with most products, Stikk does have its limitations and we will explain these and tips on how you can avoid damaging your Stikk or objects and surfaces you use to Stikk with.

Sticking & Removing Stikk from an object or Surface
 To avoid damage to the object and surface that you are sticking to, and to make sure your Stikk pad lasts a long time, we advise using a Twist Then Pull method, as seen in our video. This will reduce the chances of the unlikely event your Stikk pad may damage a surface, object or itself.
Temperature
Stikk works great in almost all temperates, high or low without changing the way it sticks. We do however advise that you reduce usage in extreme temperatures either low or high. For example we would advise that you DO NOT use stick in temperatures bellow -16C (0F) or above 62C (150F). What this means is that Stikk will work in your hot car out in the sun in MOST PLACES in the world and will work outdoors in the cold in MOST cold places. But we advise you use caution in extreme temperatures. Stikk will not melt in high temperatures, but its effectiveness may change.
Weight 
While Stikk is very strong and very durable, we advise caution when using stick. You must use common sense. If you are wanting to stick an iPad or Tablet to a wall for example to watch a film, 1 Stikk pad should hold up with no issues. But using two Stikk pads will ensure security and strength. Environmental situations can play a part in the effectiveness of a Stikk pad. If you live in a hot humid place for example, the surface may be more moist than you think, which will reduce the power of Stikk, so we would advise using two pads, especially on a larger object.    
Surfaces
As a rule of thumb, the smoother and shinier the surface, the better Stikk with hold. Stikk can be very strong on some surfaces while on others it can be very weak, again we advise you use common sense to avoid injury and damage to the objects and surfaces on which you want to hold. 
Cleaning
 The great thing about Stikk is that it is re-useable. But evertime Stikk is removed and re-used it can lose its stickiness and get dirty as dust, dirt and other contaminants get stuck to it. But all you have to do to get your Stikk Gel pad back to its glory is rinse it under warm water. Just run some warm water and hold the Stikk pad under the stream while lightly massaging it, this will help remove and stubborn dirt and dust. Then, once clean, simply leave to air dry on the top of the tap. We suggest not using a towel or drying the washed Stikk pad in anyway other than air drying, to make sure that it regains its strength.


We stress that unless Stikk is washed regularly after being removed from surfaces, Stikk will eventually lose its sticky characteristics due to dust and dirt build up. To avoid this, be sure to wash your Stikk pad(s) regularly to avoid damage and ensure a long life. We also stress that although Stikk can safely hold 350g objects, these figures are found in ideal household conditions. If you are using expensive items, we suggest using two or more Stikk pads, just incase the surface you are sticking to is less than ideal, this will help to reduce the risk of the unlikely occurrence of Stikk coming loose. 
Should you have any issues or concerns after receiving your Stikk pad, we will be happy to hear them, to both, make sure you have a perfect experience using Stikk and so that we can work on any and all short comings (not that there are any ;) that we may have missed during the testing process for our recipe. We are confident that you will all have a great experience with Stikk, but we are here to help should any issues arise. 
We hope you enjoy the idea and uses for Stikk Gel pads and will want to join us on our mission to make them a reality. If you have any questions, just leave them in the comments section so everyone can see and we will make sure to get back to you as soon as we can. 
Thank You all for the support.

Disclaimer: Use Stikk with common sense. Do not overload Stikk or use it with heavy objects. The heavier the object, or the more expensive or precious the object, the more Stikk pads you should use to safely hold your object to the surface. Use common sense and judgement when choosing a surface to stick your Stikk pad too, not all surfaces will have the same strength capabilities as others and the same goes with materials of the objects you want to stick. Stick, Plus 8 and any related persons or groups are not liable in anyway for any damage to your belongings, surfaces or self when using Stikk. 
Returns: Should you receive your Stikk Pad in less than perfect condition, you may contact us for a free replacement. We will be happy to work with all of our backers to resolve any and all issues that they have, should any arise.

</div></div>","Short Summary
Andrea Lopez, native of Brooklyn NY is a fashion designer and pet care specialist. In 2001 she pursued her passion and studied fashion design at Wood Tobe Coburn in New York City. After nine years of being in the industry, she found a new passion with animals and pursued opportunities in the pet care business.
Ms. Lopez continued to develop her hands on experience of operating the pet care business and in 2013 she opened her pet spa. She fused her fashion expertise and newly found pet industry knowledge to build a business where she can provide care services and custom clothing for pets. She developed a brand known as ANALLO Pet Couture. She believes that pets should be as fashionable as their human or dressed even better. 
Her reason for starting a pet clothing line is because she loves designing, wants to see pet fashion evolve onto the runway, magazines, and sold in more stores. She believes in using better quality and securely constructing it so its durable enough to last for years to come. Her tasteful designs are cheek, trendy, and edgy. Ms. Lopez believes she can change up the game in the pet clothing industry but she needs your help.
Having the ability to express her creativity and bring other people's ideas to life is amazing. Anallo sets a fashion statement that allows your pet to be unique and while he or she struts down the streets everyone will gravitate towards them. What does your pet's fashion say about you?  

What We Need & What You GetIn order to make this brand come to life funding is needed. All contributions will go towards the start up of Anallo Pet Couture. All designs that are already created were funded from our own resources.

<h3><b>About the matchlights</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>The battery is a lithium tube type battery, 3mm in diameter and approximately 20mm long.</p>
<p>There's a small 3mmx3mm neodymium magnet adhered to the bottom of the battery, which is then coated with a plastic-rubber sheath (coating) for extra protection and to ensure the magnet stays firmly attached.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1456913287/v26bofgidcwmycswk7ol.svg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The LED/Switch mechanism is more or less permanently attached to the battery. With enough force, you could remove it however the battery does account for a significant portion of the product cost so for the first version at least, although the battery is not replaceable, extra matchlights will be available (without the matchbook) for supporters wanting some spares.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1456913375/oibfbmopqci3zzfy13wv.svg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">As the infamous saying goes, the best flashlight is the one you have with you. At this size, you can keep them just about anywhere, in any thing, for all manner of emergencies. They are easy to switch on, with just one hand (though switching off will take two) and as they are fully waterproof, you can use them in the worst of weather conditions and know they'll just work.</span><br/></p>
<div>
<p><br/></p>
</div>
<h3><b>About the matchbook</b></h3>Similar in appearance and size to common matchbooks containing real matches, the MBI MatchBook will be created from water repellent card stock but inside, at the base, there will be a plastic holder containing magnets, which will keep each matchlight held in place.</div>

<h3>Manufacturing</h3>
<h4>(see my track record below - ""previous achievements"")</h4>
<p>Having worked on multiple iterations of this Matchbook over the past 24 months, I'm confident in being able to produce and deliver the MBI Matchbook at a standard of high quality and at a scale capable of exceeding the demands of this campaign.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1456913483/bnl3v89n1h924koojrfb.svg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<b>Risks at scale </b><br/><p>At present, the only issue pending confirmation at mass production is measuring the amount of tolerance (variance) in the vertical alignment of the printed logo on the Matchlights (specifically the words ""MBI"" on the black sheath/cover). </p>
<p>The logo printing happens before the Matchlights are assembled. During the final adhesion/fastening process there is some natural tolerance (variance of mm) in the exact placement height of the printed logo on a finished Matchlight. Whilst this has no effect at all on the function, I'm very picky when it comes to aesthetics and so if the time required at mass production to ensure perfectly aligned logos has a significant impact on cost, I may opt to produce the Matchlights with no logo printed on the matchlights themselves. </p>

<h3>F.A.Q.</h3>
<b>What colors are available? </b><br/>Matchlights will be available in the following packages:<br/>7x Red, 1x White<br/>7x Green, 1x White<br/>7x White, 1x Red
<br/><br/>
<p><b>How can I select my color? </b><br/>Approximately 1 month after the campaign ends, you'll receive an email with a link to choose your color package. If you don't choose a color, the default package will contain 7x Red, 1x White.</p>
<p><b>Will any other colors/packages be available? </b><br/>Possibly as a stretch goal.</p>
<div>
<b>Can you ship internationally?</b><br/>Yes. There is a flat rate shipping fee of $7.50 to anywhere in the world.</div>
<div>
<br/><p><b>Can I track my package?</b><br/>Yes. The shipping method is ""Registered International Airmail"" and typically takes 10-14 days to most destinations around the world. You will receive a tracking number and link to a tracking page when your order has shipped.</p>
<div>
<b>What if my address changes? </b><br/>No problem :) About 14 days before shipping, you will receive an email to let you know your order is being prepared and you'll have a chance to update all relevant details at that time.<p></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<b>When will it ship? </b><br/>Orders will be fulfilled during July 2016.</div>
<br/>
<div>
<b>Can I replace the battery?</b><br/>Short answer, no. (not yet... see below). </div>
<div>This is something <b>I am working on</b> (and I think I have it figured out) but honestly it's going to take some custom molds and tooling along with some more prototyping iterations, and with a minimum funding target in the vicinity of $70,000+ to make it commercially viable. So with this first version (an MVP - minimum viable product), my goal is to establish your trust, deliver the product as promised, and gage the true demand. To do that well and on time, I have to start at step 1 (the MVP), reduce and eliminate every conceivable manufacturing risk and then, as with every product I've created to date, iterate and enhance (I'm always actively looking to improve).</div>
<br/>
<div>
<b>Can this replace my regular flashlight?</b><br/>Most likely not (unless you don't have one to begin with). The matchlights are not going to be anywhere near as bright as a flashlight using a larger battery. They do produce light, and that can be useful in an emergency when the only alternative is dark. <br/>
</div>
<br/>
<div>
<b>What do I do with them when the battery runs out?</b><br/>They make great little fridge magnets for holding memos, and work well on tactical coaching boards too. You can also send them to me and I'll be happy to recycle them in the most responsible manner. You can of course keep them, as a souvenir/trophy of sorts of our version 1 matchlight.<br/>

<div>
<b>My story as a product designer</b><br/>
</div>
<div>
<u>I've been designing, building and selling exotic flashlights for the last 5 years</u> as a very successful hobby, and I've had an immense passion for light since I was a young kid.</div>
<div>Based in Japan, I have several existing hobby projects in development where I'm quite transparent regarding the process, sharing the trials and challenges publicly, along with the companionship, advice and feedback of a very knowledgable and passionate community of supporters, all of which is publicly viewable (links below). </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<p><b>Previous achievements</b></p>
<div>
<p>I'll admit to being a perfectionist and stickler for small details, often times spending months (sometimes years) to get something right before I release it. Here are some external reviews/references for some of my previous designs, ranked by many as the best in their class.</p>

<div>
<b>My challenge</b><br/>
</div>
<div>Whilst I'm very fortunate to have a modest, yet dedicated following for my creations, I'm always challenged to meet the demand for my new products that to date have been machined in controlled,  micro-batches, with the final assembly, packaging and fulfillment all handled by me personally. This often means may consecutive late nights, working into the wee hours, to get as many products out to my supporters as I'm able to create. Of course, with that approach, there is a finite limit to capacity.</div>
<div>Many of my existing products have waiting lists, usually selling out entirely, just shortly after their release, and as the number of my creations grow, cashflow becomes a limiting factor in terms of how many products I can develop or release at the same time. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>My Ambition</b></div>
<div>I sincerely want to be able to share my creations with all those who want them which means I'm going to need some hired help along with some larger scale automation in assembly and fullfillment, but for that to make sense economically, I need to exceed <span style=""background-color: initial;"">the minimum volume thresholds by where the project becomes feasible. This is where we can help each other.</span>
</div>
<div>I've chosen the MBI MatchBook as my first Indiegogo product because the challenge to bring this to market, is only one of volume and scale.

</div></div>","Introducing the MBI MatchBook...

8 ultra-miniature flashlights, each the size of a match, in a conveniently cool matchbook style holder.



The worlds smallest production flashlight

Waterproof and fully submersible
Convenient magnetic base makes them easy to stick around
The LED tint is available in a variety of colors (White, Red, Green)
 So small you can keep several in your wallet for emergencies
So light, you can take a whole pack camping and have 64hrs of light
Runtime of each matchlight is approximately 8 hours














































About the matchlights

The battery is a lithium tube type battery, 3mm in diameter and approximately 20mm long.
There's a small 3mmx3mm neodymium magnet adhered to the bottom of the battery, which is then coated with a plastic-rubber sheath (coating) for extra protection and to ensure the magnet stays firmly attached.



The LED/Switch mechanism is more or less permanently attached to the battery. With enough force, you could remove it however the battery does account for a significant portion of the product cost so for the first version at least, although the battery is not replaceable, extra matchlights will be available (without the matchbook) for supporters wanting some spares.



As the infamous saying goes, the best flashlight is the one you have with you. At this size, you can keep them just about anywhere, in any thing, for all manner of emergencies. They are easy to switch on, with just one hand (though switching off will take two) and as they are fully waterproof, you can use them in the worst of weather conditions and know they'll just work.



About the matchbookSimilar in appearance and size to common matchbooks containing real matches, the MBI MatchBook will be created from water repellent card stock but inside, at the base, there will be a plastic holder containing magnets, which will keep each matchlight held in place.







Manufacturing
(see my track record below - ""previous achievements"")
Having worked on multiple iterations of this Matchbook over the past 24 months, I'm confident in being able to produce and deliver the MBI Matchbook at a standard of high quality and at a scale capable of exceeding the demands of this campaign.



Risks at scale At present, the only issue pending confirmation at mass production is measuring the amount of tolerance (variance) in the vertical alignment of the printed logo on the Matchlights (specifically the words ""MBI"" on the black sheath/cover). 
The logo printing happens before the Matchlights are assembled. During the final adhesion/fastening process there is some natural tolerance (variance of mm) in the exact placement height of the printed logo on a finished Matchlight. Whilst this has no effect at all on the function, I'm very picky when it comes to aesthetics and so if the time required at mass production to ensure perfectly aligned logos has a significant impact on cost, I may opt to produce the Matchlights with no logo printed on the matchlights themselves. 








F.A.Q.
What colors are available? Matchlights will be available in the following packages:7x Red, 1x White7x Green, 1x White7x White, 1x Red

How can I select my color? Approximately 1 month after the campaign ends, you'll receive an email with a link to choose your color package. If you don't choose a color, the default package will contain 7x Red, 1x White.
Will any other colors/packages be available? Possibly as a stretch goal.

Can you ship internationally?Yes. There is a flat rate shipping fee of $7.50 to anywhere in the world.

Can I track my package?Yes. The shipping method is ""Registered International Airmail"" and typically takes 10-14 days to most destinations around the world. You will receive a tracking number and link to a tracking page when your order has shipped.

What if my address changes? No problem :) About 14 days before shipping, you will receive an email to let you know your order is being prepared and you'll have a chance to update all relevant details at that time.



When will it ship? Orders will be fulfilled during July 2016.


Can I replace the battery?Short answer, no. (not yet... see below). 
This is something I am working on (and I think I have it figured out) but honestly it's going to take some custom molds and tooling along with some more prototyping iterations, and with a minimum funding target in the vicinity of $70,000+ to make it commercially viable. So with this first version (an MVP - minimum viable product), my goal is to establish your trust, deliver the product as promised, and gage the true demand. To do that well and on time, I have to start at step 1 (the MVP), reduce and eliminate every conceivable manufacturing risk and then, as with every product I've created to date, iterate and enhance (I'm always actively looking to improve).


Can this replace my regular flashlight?Most likely not (unless you don't have one to begin with). The matchlights are not going to be anywhere near as bright as a flashlight using a larger battery. They do produce light, and that can be useful in an emergency when the only alternative is dark. 



What do I do with them when the battery runs out?They make great little fridge magnets for holding memos, and work well on tactical coaching boards too. You can also send them to me and I'll be happy to recycle them in the most responsible manner. You can of course keep them, as a souvenir/trophy of sorts of our version 1 matchlight.




More About me
Hi Indiegogo, I'm Guy from MBI - MatchBox Instruments and I'm very excited to share this project with you. You can learn more about my work at www.matchboxinstruments.com and you'll find links to some of my more complex long term (in development) projects hosted at candlepowerfxorums.


My story as a product designer


I've been designing, building and selling exotic flashlights for the last 5 years as a very successful hobby, and I've had an immense passion for light since I was a young kid.
Based in Japan, I have several existing hobby projects in development where I'm quite transparent regarding the process, sharing the trials and challenges publicly, along with the companionship, advice and feedback of a very knowledgable and passionate community of supporters, all of which is publicly viewable (links below). 


Previous achievements

I'll admit to being a perfectionist and stickler for small details, often times spending months (sometimes years) to get something right before I release it. Here are some external reviews/references for some of my previous designs, ranked by many as the best in their class.

My challenge

Whilst I'm very fortunate to have a modest, yet dedicated following for my creations, I'm always challenged to meet the demand for my new products that to date have been machined in controlled,  micro-batches, with the final assembly, packaging and fulfillment all handled by me personally. This often means may consecutive late nights, working into the wee hours, to get as many products out to my supporters as I'm able to create. Of course, with that approach, there is a finite limit to capacity.
Many of my existing products have waiting lists, usually selling out entirely, just shortly after their release, and as the number of my creations grow, cashflow becomes a limiting factor in terms of how many products I can develop or release at the same time. 

My Ambition
I sincerely want to be able to share my creations with all those who want them which means I'm going to need some hired help along with some larger scale automation in assembly and fullfillment, but for that to make sense economically, I need to exceed the minimum volume thresholds by where the project becomes feasible. This is where we can help each other.

I've chosen the MBI MatchBook as my first Indiegogo product because the challenge to bring this to market, is only one of volume and scale. I can already manufacture these in small batches (as could you) but without automation, the process is very very time consuming and ends up being very expensive (because as with most hand made items, time is often the largest cost).
As many of my followers know, I have several more products that I plan to share so ensuring my first Indiegogo project is on time and successful is a critical and important step on the MBI roadmap. After 5 years of R&D on a broad variety of flashlight related products and manufacturing, I believe I'm well organized and capable of delivering the MBI MatchBook at a high standard of quality and execution and I'm grateful for your support.

That’s why we created Fyre, the first fashion friendly heated apparel line to date. No matter where or when the cold strikes Fyre will be there for you, ready to rev up and keep you warm, all while letting you maintain your own personal style.Have you ever thought about getting a heated jacket to keep you warm during the winter but didn’t want to sacrifice looks for functionality? You’ll wear the same winter coat practically the whole season so why not pick the one YOU want. Fyre will hide discretely under whatever overcoat you choose to keep you warm regardless of the fashion state you want to make! The places you can use Fyre are endless. Just put it on and let it bring the heat whenever you need it most. Use Fyre: Fyre will use extremely thin and flexible carbon heating fibers that ensure an even distribution of heat that you will feel as a nice warm hug, all day long. These fibers are hair thin and are machine-washable meaning you’ll be able to throw Fyre in with your other clothing after removing the battery alone.Fyre will also have a built-in microprocessor controller that is able to easily detect desired ambient temperature and adjust the voltage of Fyre’s energy output accordingly. Fyre then cycles its temperature output on and off in short intervals to ensure the user’s body is kept exactly where they have set it to. This temperature cycling is smart and adaptive allowing it to react to even the most drastic swings in environmental temperatures. This efficient system of smart-temperature cycling means Fyre will never be too hot and won’t force you to spend time fiddling with controls just to get it to a temperature you are happy with.Fyre produces the bulk of its heat on the back and chest areas where the body’s temperature is most efficiently regulated. That being said, with Fyre’s insolating fabric the warmth will also be passed on to the rest of your body efficiently as well. Fyre features an ultra-lightweight, rechargeable 6000mAh battery that can easily power Fyre for hours without needing a charge. Fyre’s battery is tucked seamless into your hoodie or cardigan pocket where you can easily access it to swap it out or to connect it with your smartphone to charge it discretely!It’s never a bad idea to have an extra Fyre battery on hand either since you can use it to keep your electronics fully juiced or to get even more heating time out of Fyre. Fyre’s battery is the perfect balance of sleekness, functionality and practicality. Fyre’s app is super-smart while keeping as much control in the hands of Fyre’s built in microprocessor system as possible. You won’t have to constantly play around with the Fyre app just to set Fyre to the temperature you feel comfortable at since the hardware does this for you. That being said, our personal temperature preferences change from day to day and even during the day so when you need to use the Fyre app the experience is made as seemless as possible with voice commands and super simple adjustment controls to make Fyre easy to adjust, even while wearing big ol’ winter mittens.  In essence, Fyre is the perfect balance of style and functionality and is designed for all season, dynamic use. Other lines function well but look awful or force you to adopt a style that isn’t “you”. Other’s may look decent but functionality tends to suffer.

But what does this mean exactly? The Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS) is recognized as the world's leading processing standard for textiles made from organic fibres. It defines high-level environmental criteria along the entire organic textiles supply chain and requires compliance with social criteria as well. Organic cotton is better for the environment, for the farmers working on the cotton fields, and for the people wearing the clothing. Some of the big differences between organic cotton and conventional cotton are that organic cotton is GMO-free, and there are no chemical pesticides and insecticides used. When whitening conventional cotton, chlorine bleaching is used and toxic by products are released in to the environment, when whitening organic cotton, safe peroxide is used. Moreover, organic certification includes requirements for fair wages and treatment of workers in the supply chain.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1467379900/djd6d21aw3ick3vbr11s.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1467382044/saymtqi6bcniu4jqgh6l.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>What does it mean for a factory to be linked to the Fair Wear Foundation?

To date they have helped to launch 6 businesses at 4 schools, including chicken farms, organic vegetable gardens, a tailoring centre, an IT centre and a carpentry workshop.</p><p>- Vocational education: In the rural communities where School Club Zambia works, most young people who finish school at Grade 7 or 8 (Primary Level) will follow their parents into small-scale farming or fishing the depleting stocks of Lake Kariba.

In 2015 School Club Zambia partnered with literacy specialists Happy Readers, whose programs have already had a life-changing effect on many young people's lives. The Amartya Foundation provides more than just financial support or donations; Amartya's founder Sunny will travel to Zambia on September 30th to volunteer for The School Club Zambia herself.  Sizes: Women's S, M, LMen's S, M, LThe theme of our designs is awareness, which is an important keyword for our brand.Knowledge is power - as the proverb states: give a man a fish and he will eat for a day, teach a man to fish and he will eat for a lifetime. Having knowledge gives people the power to take control over their life and create the life they want, which is the greatest power anyone can have. Ignorance is evil - this is a very important statement: ignorance creates a world in which people with good hearts commit atrocities without being aware of it. This means that injustice goes unnoticed.

It wasn't until the last couple of years that I realized that I'm very good at designing T-shirts! I've used websites like Zazzle and Cafepress to make <a href=""#"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">custom shirts</span></a> for my friends and myself. After I started hearing about how other people wanted copies of my shirts, I started to think that maybe I was a little bit better at it than I first thought.

<p>Helping me out in this endeavor is almost indescribable. Like most people in this day and age, I'm not happy about where I am in life and what I'm doing. Being able to change all that; to be able to know each and every day that my job, my business's, main goal is to bring other people some extra laughs and happiness in their lives is something I've wanted longer that I can remember. Funding my pledge drive will make it possible for me to fully stock my business shelves and give me the freedom to fully concentrate on giving my customers the best experience they will ever find from great customer service, the most original products, and the fastest shipping.</p>
<p>I'd like to consider myself to be pretty creative, but beyond stick figures, I can't draw to save my life. And I can design an amateurish website for people to get a laugh at, but a professionally designed one is beyond my capabilities. That's why a portion of the funds collected here will be going to my phenomenally talented artist, and my unbelievably awesome web designer. Along with me, they are committed to trying to give you the best possible experience you can have. The majority of the funds will be going to my printing company Monkey In A Dryer, which thankfully is local to me, and will save on shipping costs.

Our Story</h2>
<p>My name is Scott Heath and I run Blaze-In Sportswear. Apparel is my passion and I have spent most of my life in the business. I started Blaze-In to introduce a new concept of the traditional blue blazer by customizing the lining of the blazer using an organization's colors for striped lining as well as crests/logos embroidered on the inside pockets and gold embossed buttons. We sell our top of the line, worsted wool blazers for men, women and children to prep schools, colleges, universities, fraternities, clubs and similar organizations who feel a sense of pride towards their school or establishment. We also make custom printed shorts made of a new, lightweight, fast-drying micro fiber featuring mesh pocket lining and a waterproof back pocket.</p>
<p>In addition to making custom Blazers and Shorts, Blaze-In is dedicated to fundraising for these organizations. For every blazer we make, we donate a large percentage back to the school, charity or foundation.</p>

Act fast. There is only a limited number of time before this campaign ends!---------------------------------------------------------------------Hello! We are The Good CollectiveThe main reason we are doing this campaign is to build a classroom for an underserved school in the Philippines. Ardemil National High School in Iloilo, Philippines needs at least 3 classrooms for the next school year. Some of their classrooms have been destroyed by Typhoon Haiyan in 2013 and up until now those classrooms are still left unattended to. We deemed it's time that some positive change happen for this school. Ardemil National High SchoolIn 2013, a massive typhoon hit the islands of the Philippines and left in its wake 12000+ classrooms damaged or destroyed. This school was deeply affected by that tragedy and they need our help. Jamie (second from bottom left) of The Good Collective visited Ardemil High School in December last year to find out how we could be of service.•••Profits from all the shirts purchased will be used to build a classroom for Ardemil.•••Our team, The Good Collective is a nonprofit organization based in Toronto, Canada. Our medium-term mission is to rebuild 500 classrooms in areas hit by Typhoon Haiyan in 2013. We believe that education changes everything. We also believe that a small group of committed people can make big changes happen.•••The change we want to see happen in the very near future is to start building at least one classroom for this school. They lost several rooms during the Typhoon in 2013. That makes it hard for them to accommodate all of their students. This year, the government wanted them to add Grades 11 and 12. These requires more rooms and they are not getting the assistance they need.If we don't step up for them, it may take years, maybe even decades, before they receive the funding that they require. The cost to construct the classroom is around CAD$14,000 or USD$10,400This is where you come in.We are inviting you to be part of this hopeful and joyful project.•••We created the The Ardemil Shirt specifically to raise the funds we need. We will manufacture a limited run of shirts. Once every piece is sold, we will have enough money to complete this classroom. This Indiegogo campaign will be the staring point and, hopefully, even the end point to completely sell out this limited run.•••A. Choose a PerkB.

<p>We created Linjer after years of toting around uninspiring laptop bags, and being frustrated by fruitless searches for elegant, functional work bags under $1,500. </p>
<p>We saw the beauty of a simple solution and our answer was to create our own leather products that we could treasure and sell at a fair price—one that isn't inflated by expensive storefronts, middlemen, or excessive marketing campaigns.</p>
<p>We chose the name Linjer (Norwegian for ‘lines’) because what could be simpler than a line? Clean, understated and an essential part of everyday life: the name reflects the minimalist Scandinavian style that inspires us. (Roman is the Norwegian among us ;))</p>
<p>Thanks to successful crowdfunding last year we were able to launch our first collection and now, a thousand happy customers later, we’re excited to present our next collection. We would love your support in helping us bring it to life!</p>

<p>Only the best leather makes the cut for our designs. We use full grain, vegetable-tanned aniline leather: we love it and we think you will too.</p>
<p><b>Full grain </b></p>
<p>The top surface of a hide, known as the grain, is the strongest part of the hide. ""Full grain"" means that the surface has not been buffed or sanded to remove imperfections. It is much longer-lasting and durable than top grain leather (which has been buffed or sanded) or split grain leather (which doesn't have any grain at all). Top grain leather is more prevalent on the market because it's cheaper to buy low-quality leather and buff off the defects than to buy quality hides. We like to let the leather’s natural beauty speak for itself. <br/><br/><b>Vegetable-tanned</b></p>
<p>Vegetable tanning is the traditional tanning method refined by the Spanish, Italians and French during the Renaissance. Today it makes up only 10% of leather produced. Unaided by potent chemicals, vegetable tanning takes much longer than chrome tanning (several weeks/months vs a day). As a result, it can be more expensive…but it’s worth it. Vegetable-tanned leather looks natural, smells sweet and develops a unique patina over time. </p>
<p><b>Aniline</b> </p>
<p>...indicates that the leather has been dyed the whole way through. Pigmented leather, in contrast, has a coat of paint sprayed on top and is cheaper to make.

</div>","About this project






We created Linjer after years of toting around uninspiring laptop bags, and being frustrated by fruitless searches for elegant, functional work bags under $1,500. 
We saw the beauty of a simple solution and our answer was to create our own leather products that we could treasure and sell at a fair price—one that isn't inflated by expensive storefronts, middlemen, or excessive marketing campaigns.
We chose the name Linjer (Norwegian for ‘lines’) because what could be simpler than a line? Clean, understated and an essential part of everyday life: the name reflects the minimalist Scandinavian style that inspires us. (Roman is the Norwegian among us ;))
Thanks to successful crowdfunding last year we were able to launch our first collection and now, a thousand happy customers later, we’re excited to present our next collection. We would love your support in helping us bring it to life!

Here at T Cycling, our mission is to create beautiful performance cycling apparel at a cost that does not break the bank. Based in London, UK, we have spent painstakingly long hours perfecting the designs of our launch lineup. Not only that, but we have been extensively testing our samples with some pretty tough sportives including London to Paris in 24 hours (280 miles in the saddle), London Revolution and the London Triathlon. We also have people testing our Tri Suits at upcoming Iron Man events so we can thoroughly ensure quality and fit it just right for you.We have been working tirelessly with our manufacturers to make sure that the best material combinations are being used to create the best compromise between comfort and fit. If you take a look in the descriptions below we will give you a breakdown of the materials used.Performance Long Sleeve Jersey - NEW ITEMWe listened good and hard in the recent survey, so here it is, our new Long Sleeve Jersey! If we sell out of all the Early Bird versions (25) we will release matching colours to the short sleeve jerseys.The Jerseys feature the same 3 pocket with extra zip pocket design as the short sleeve jersey. If you have already pledged, simply add the extra amount to your pledge, then message us so we can make a note against your pledge.T Cycling Cap - NEW ITEMProfessional Racing JerseysWHAT THEY ARE MADE FROMWe have spent a lot of time experimenting with different materials and combinations of materials to try and make what we personally feel is one of the comfiest jerseys we personally have tried on.The side panels and sleeves are made from 90 GSM Italian made Kite Fabric, which is Super Breathable, Anti Bacterial, Lightweight and Moisture Wicking. It is also UPF25+ to help protect you from UV rays when cycling.The main part of the jersey is made from 130 GSM Italian made Ventilare Fabric, which is Breathable, Lightweight and Anti Bacterial. It has a UPF35+ rating which should go a long way towards helping protect your skin when cycling. Obviously, we highly recommend the use of sunscreen when cycling.All our jerseys have a racing profile 3 pocket design. We also thought we would add a fourth integrated zip-up pocket into the 3 pocket design for your valuables, we know how easy it is to accidentally flick out your credit card whilst accessing your pockets. We made the zip of the pocket reflective, just to add a little safety feature into the design for while your riding in low light. The RangeIsometric Jersey - Teal / YellowIsometric Jersey - MonochromePlus Jersey - Orange / NavyTriangles Jersey - Black / WhiteTriangles Jersey - Black / RedTriangles Jersey - Black / YellowTriangles Jersey - Yellow / YellowTriangles Jersey - Black / BlueProfessional Racing Bib ShortsWHAT THEY ARE MADE OFOur Bib Shorts are made from a compression material which has a mix of 80% Polyester and 20% Spandex.

<ul><li>As easy and fast it seems l<b>ike magic</b>: mount it, put your garment and sprinkle with water. Within seconds, you will be ironed.</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b>Save money</b>: iPress does<b> not require electricity</b> or maintenance.</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b>ECO-EFFICIENT 0% Emissions</b> of carbon dioxide <b>CO2</b> and does not require electrical power for its operation or any maintenance that depends on it.</li></ul>

<b>Save space</b> in your clothes line and hang it where you want:<b> iPress</b> is designed to <b>hang</b>wherever you need. Indoors as a normal hanger, <b>outdoor security mechanism not to fly,</b>

<p> The <b>STRETCHING</b> applied to clothing by the <b>iPress </b>breaks the molecular bonds between the fibers, returning them to their naturally smooth state in an instant. Once the operation is complete, the fibers will have changed their molecular orientation and the garment can be left to dry normally as it no longer needs to be stretched on the iPress, which can be folded up again.</p>
<p>To <b>remove</b> the <b>creases </b>and<b> wrinkles</b> from a long-sleeved shirt, hang the iPress up and use one hand to achieve a more uniform tension in the lower parts of the shirt and at the sleeve ends, and the other to spray it with water using the <b>iPress Sprayer Travel or Home</b>.</p>
<p> </p>
<b>iPress </b>also could be used to<b> eliminate wrinkles</b> and creases of <b>wet clothes</b> and goes directly<b>from</b><b>your laundry</b> ... for it must maintain the stretching until the garment is <b>dry.</b>

<p>In the last two years, we have been working around the clock refining our designs: numerous prototypes have been developed and countless hours have been spent making sure the iPress will be as good as we intend them to be. After extensive research, we have also established a good relationship with a manufacturer that has many years of experiences in the field of <br/>Plastic Injection and is able to work to our exact specifications.   But as with ANY new product, timeline is always the biggest risk. We will make every effort to deliver on time, and could even deliver the product before expected. However, there could be unforeseen circumstances that may present themselves during early production.

<ul><li> </li></ul> </div><p> </p><div> <h3> </h3> </div><p> </p><p> </p></div>","iPress is a simple invention that removes creases and wrinkles from your garments. Its clever design takes advantage of the physico-chemical properties of the textile fibers in clothing, creating a revolutionary new method of garment care.


Forget ironing forever iPress will forget the iron forever. Ironing your clothes comfortably without hating the process.
As easy and fast it seems like magic: mount it, put your garment and sprinkle with water. Within seconds, you will be ironed.

Save money: iPress does not require electricity or maintenance.

ECO-EFFICIENT 0% Emissions of carbon dioxide CO2 and does not require electrical power for its operation or any maintenance that depends on it.

Save space in your clothes line and hang it where you want: iPress is designed to hangwherever you need. Indoors as a normal hanger, outdoor security mechanism not to fly,


The clothes will last longer: iPress about your clothes better than traditional appliances.

Use it anywhere: iPress can be used at home, in the office, in a hotel, mobile home, boat ... or even on the street! 
iPress does not occupy space: iPress can be removed so that you may take it wherever you want. Fits in your suitcase or in your backpack.

mobile home, boat....// if you don´t have to hang iPress, you can put it on the floor // the iron is angry, right?
 
 The STRETCHING applied to clothing by the iPress breaks the molecular bonds between the fibers, returning them to their naturally smooth state in an instant. Once the operation is complete, the fibers will have changed their molecular orientation and the garment can be left to dry normally as it no longer needs to be stretched on the iPress, which can be folded up again.
To remove the creases and wrinkles from a long-sleeved shirt, hang the iPress up and use one hand to achieve a more uniform tension in the lower parts of the shirt and at the sleeve ends, and the other to spray it with water using the iPress Sprayer Travel or Home.
 
iPress also could be used to eliminate wrinkles and creases of wet clothes and goes directlyfromyour laundry ... for it must maintain the stretching until the garment is dry.


iPress is very easy to use! Only 3 (or even 2) steps:  
1. Incorporate a garment.
2. Use iPress Sprayer (only if the garment is not wet).
3. Science will do the magic!

We’ve partnered with plastic manufacturer with years of experience making industrial plastic products in Spain . We’ve been working together for almost a year preparing to manufacture and get iPress in your hands quickly.

We need your support to offset a portion of the upfront manufacturing costs for iPress. Releasing through Kickstarter helps us to quickly recoup a portion of the initial costs while being able to reward our early supporters with a discount. With your support this will be the first of many smart designs to come. 



The whole process manufactured in Spain 
 Our goal, like the jean hanger, will be to create functionally better products for everyday use, energy savings and convenience. We have been moving steadily towards our goal of a great product. We cannot wait to share iPress with you and release it out into the world.
Thank you for your support!.
  Riesgos y desafíos
In the last two years, we have been working around the clock refining our designs: numerous prototypes have been developed and countless hours have been spent making sure the iPress will be as good as we intend them to be. After extensive research, we have also established a good relationship with a manufacturer that has many years of experiences in the field of Plastic Injection and is able to work to our exact specifications.   But as with ANY new product, timeline is always the biggest risk. We will make every effort to deliver on time, and could even deliver the product before expected. However, there could be unforeseen circumstances that may present themselves during early production. We ask for your patience, and promise to deliver a quality product to each and every backer as soon as possible.
In any case, we will keep you informed of any changes. Thank you for helping make this product a reality.",21.0,2,"1 Campaign

<p>·<span> 
</span><span>Re-inventing the men’s shirt, Bringing
a century old design into the 21<sup>st</sup> century</span></p>
<p><strong>Never Iron</strong> – Self Ironing Material ensures a
crisp Slip Shirt all the time; saving you countless hours, giving you more time
to get on with the more important things.</p>
<p><strong>Stay Sharp</strong> – Wrinkle Free Technology, keeps you
looking sharp all the time, making it your number one choice for travelling
because there's nothing more annoying then opening up your suit case after a
long flight and finding all your good shirts wrinkled. Get yourself a Slip
Shirt and you'll never have to worry about wrinkled shirts again.</p>
<p><strong>Slip On, Slip Off – </strong>The Slip Shirt only has the top
2 buttons undoable the lower 5 are always done for you, don’t
waste any more time with buttons, just Slip the shirt on and Slip the shirt
off.</p>
<p><strong>SPORT X DRY – </strong>Our Slip Shirt is made using SPORT X
DRY technology, the same technology used in top sports wear. SPORT X DRY is a
rapid water wicking feature built into the fabric. To you, the wearer, this
means that the fabric will draw moisture away from your skin without sticking
and will rapidly diffuse and dry, to leave you cool, comfortable and virtually
sweat free all day long.</p>
<p><strong>Ultra-Slim Fit – </strong>The Slip Shirt features an
ultra-slim fit, making it one of the slimmest fitting shirts available.
Due to its unique design the Slip Shirt moulds around your body,
allowing you to show off your muscles and look dressed-up. Simply choose your
usual size, either Medium or Large, and the Slip Shirt will do the rest (refer
to the sizing chart). Alternatively if you do want a slightly looser shirt, opt
for a size up and you will have a Slim Fit, which keeps you looking slim and
stylish.</p>
<p><strong>Ultimate Comfort – </strong>We have made the Slip Shirt with the utmost wearer in mind, in addition
to the above features the Slip Shirt is also features maximum<strong> </strong>breathability
and a Superior Super Soft handle for next to skin comfort.</p>
<p><strong>21<sup>st</sup> Century Style – </strong>Since it was invented, in the early 1900’s, the modern
dress shirt as you know it has been structurally the same with minor
adjustments over the years. Things like different types of cuffs, collars,
pockets, sleeves and fits have all been changed and brought back in endless cycles.
You may think the dress shirt is good enough, but here at GOWDA we believe that
fashion should be better than good enough, it should be the utmost in style and
functionality. The problem is the dress shirt hasn’t been ‘officially’ bought
into the 21st century. Rather than make minor adjustments to a century old
design we have decided to completely re-invent the dress shirt, creating the
Slip Shirt.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/615924/files/20140531023702-4.1_suit_2.jpg?1401529022"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/613727/files/20140530025547-5__One_shirt__every_occasion..jpg?1401443747"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>In addition to all the features described above, what truly separates
the Slip Shirt from the rest is its ability to be worn in any occasion.</p>
<p>As comfortable as your favourite t-shirt, you will feel great
everywhere you wear it. With the style of your best dress shirt, there isn’t an
occasion where the Slip Shirt can’t take you. Besides Function and Design the
colour scheme has to work too, that’s why the Original Slip Shirt is made with the
White/Black colour scheme, the reason this colour scheme was chosen is White is
the only shirt colour that can truly work for every occasion, making it the perfect colour
choice for the only shirt that also works in every occasion.</p>
<p>Truly modern innovation combined with the timeless White/Black
colour scheme, wear it to parties, weddings, work, business, day out, night out
or even for the occasions when you hit the red carpet, the GOWDA Slip Shirt
truly is the ultimate; ""One Shirt, Every Occasion"".</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/615925/files/20140531023746-5.1_cafe_3.jpg?1401529066"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/613730/files/20140530025641-6_Meet_the_Creators.jpg?1401443801"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Meet the

<p><b>What’s ‘Truly Functional
Fashion’?</b></p>
<p>Here at GOWDA we specialize in being one of the few
fashion labels with the wearer truly in mind. We believe that clothing should
be stylish <i>and</i> easy to wear without extremely high prices, which is why
we created our range of ‘Truly Functional Fashion’.</p>
<p>In fashion, the term ‘functional’ usually refers to
clothes that are very simple in design and easily worn but often they are not
as simple to wear nor with a simple design are they ‘true’ fashion. The term
‘Truly Functional Fashion’ means our clothes are very easily
worn and they are also stylish which is what men’s fashion should be.
All of our designs in the Truly Functional Fashion range are created with the
utmost usability of the wearer in mind, for a design to be included in this
category it must: eliminate as many unnecessary aspects of a garment as
possible (like buttoning and ironing), it must be comfortable to wear, easy to
maintain and of course it must be fashionable.</p>

Re-inventing the men’s shirt, Bringing
a century old design into the 21st century
Never Iron – Self Ironing Material ensures a
crisp Slip Shirt all the time; saving you countless hours, giving you more time
to get on with the more important things.
Stay Sharp – Wrinkle Free Technology, keeps you
looking sharp all the time, making it your number one choice for travelling
because there's nothing more annoying then opening up your suit case after a
long flight and finding all your good shirts wrinkled. Get yourself a Slip
Shirt and you'll never have to worry about wrinkled shirts again.
Slip On, Slip Off – The Slip Shirt only has the top
2 buttons undoable the lower 5 are always done for you, don’t
waste any more time with buttons, just Slip the shirt on and Slip the shirt
off.
SPORT X DRY – Our Slip Shirt is made using SPORT X
DRY technology, the same technology used in top sports wear. SPORT X DRY is a
rapid water wicking feature built into the fabric. To you, the wearer, this
means that the fabric will draw moisture away from your skin without sticking
and will rapidly diffuse and dry, to leave you cool, comfortable and virtually
sweat free all day long.
Ultra-Slim Fit – The Slip Shirt features an
ultra-slim fit, making it one of the slimmest fitting shirts available.
Due to its unique design the Slip Shirt moulds around your body,
allowing you to show off your muscles and look dressed-up. Simply choose your
usual size, either Medium or Large, and the Slip Shirt will do the rest (refer
to the sizing chart). Alternatively if you do want a slightly looser shirt, opt
for a size up and you will have a Slim Fit, which keeps you looking slim and
stylish.
Ultimate Comfort – We have made the Slip Shirt with the utmost wearer in mind, in addition
to the above features the Slip Shirt is also features maximum breathability
and a Superior Super Soft handle for next to skin comfort.
21st Century Style – Since it was invented, in the early 1900’s, the modern
dress shirt as you know it has been structurally the same with minor
adjustments over the years. Things like different types of cuffs, collars,
pockets, sleeves and fits have all been changed and brought back in endless cycles.
You may think the dress shirt is good enough, but here at GOWDA we believe that
fashion should be better than good enough, it should be the utmost in style and
functionality. The problem is the dress shirt hasn’t been ‘officially’ bought
into the 21st century. Rather than make minor adjustments to a century old
design we have decided to completely re-invent the dress shirt, creating the
Slip Shirt.In addition to all the features described above, what truly separates
the Slip Shirt from the rest is its ability to be worn in any occasion.
As comfortable as your favourite t-shirt, you will feel great
everywhere you wear it. With the style of your best dress shirt, there isn’t an
occasion where the Slip Shirt can’t take you. Besides Function and Design the
colour scheme has to work too, that’s why the Original Slip Shirt is made with the
White/Black colour scheme, the reason this colour scheme was chosen is White is
the only shirt colour that can truly work for every occasion, making it the perfect colour
choice for the only shirt that also works in every occasion.
Truly modern innovation combined with the timeless White/Black
colour scheme, wear it to parties, weddings, work, business, day out, night out
or even for the occasions when you hit the red carpet, the GOWDA Slip Shirt
truly is the ultimate; ""One Shirt, Every Occasion"".Meet the

As much as I would like to continue, I can not divulge any more secrets before this product is developed.What if you would like to wear beltNEX casually? beltNEX is stylish enough for it to be worn on all occasions for different people. beltNEX will come in a variety of colors including black for professionals. Along with the belt comes a detachable buckle for ornamental value.These ornamental buckles can be mixed and matched for maximum customization.Who am I? I generally like to create projects in the same league as this. One day I sat down and wondered what I could do to make a difference in peoples lives. I searched all the available products and that's when this idea came about. One experience that really stuck with me after conversing with several people is that the general wish of most disabled is the desire for independence. beltNEX can achieve that.What We Need & What You GetCurrently beltNEX is in its formative stages. I encourage you to leave your suggestions on how this idea can be improved for a greater impact. With your help and funding I will continue to develop and engineer the product.For just $100 you can ensure you will get the beltNEX as an early adopter along with a complimentary keychain flashlight.What if the funds are not met? Any amount can be used to forward this goal. With your help, we can really transform peoples lives.Other Ways You Can HelpCan't contribute? You can still help by sharing this campaign with your friends and family!beltNEX thanks you.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<div>
<br/>Voiceless Clothing all started initially as somewhat of a joke, as we weren't real serious about the idea but had backed the fundamental ideas and morals behind the project. All of us that collaborate are a close circle of friends who have struggled in many situations that we absolutely hate to see other people struggle with. We've lost a large number of friends due to suicides and illnesses, we've seen family members involved in abusive relationships, we've lost friends and family to cancer. Our main goal is to strive to help the ""Voiceless,"" the people who don't stand up in these situations to get the help that they need; whether a shoulder to cry on, someone to talk to or professional help. Through visual art and typography we strive to bring a STRONG and positive message to those surrounded by a world of grief and negativity. By helping us fund this next line we can focus more on getting our message out, more free products, and the stability of a company that has been a long and hard battle to keep alive due to the financial issues we all struggle with.</div>
<div>
<h3>WHAT WE NEED</h3>
<p>In order for us to accomplish getting this company FULLY up and running (something we've never really been able to fund ourselves) we're going to need around $2,500. These funds will cover all of our necessary costs including (Inventory of new products), products to ship to artists for tour clothes, Free Product raffles, Free give-a-ways in suburban areas strucken with poverty, as well as advertising and donations.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>THE IMPACT YOU'LL HAVE</h3>
By Donating to our cause you can fully help people reach positivity and make a major change in the help that people get on a regular basis. Your contribution will impact people who are ""voiceless"" and need help in stepping towards recovery or towards treatment!</div>

<h4> </h4>
<h4>Why the Albert Clock is fun and benefit</h4>
<div>
<p>Children enjoy racking their brains and making calculations when they’re allowed to take a playful approach. The Albert Clock, however, isn’t exclusively for kids: If you want to get the ALBERT CLOCK for your little ones because of its educational value you might soon as well take pleasure in being put to the test and having to figure out the correct time. Anyone who is interested in Sudoku puzzles and other kinds of brainteasers might also enjoy the ALBERT CLOCK. We can all benefit from this clock. First of all, it’s fun and keeps you mentally fit. Secondly, wouldn’t it be lovely to be able to quickly calculate in your head which product is cheapest per kilo, or what amount should be given as a proper tip?</p>
<h4>Time to think - now it's up to you!</h4>
<p>The Albert Clock is set to be introduced to the market in March 2016 and will cost approximately 250 Dollars / 225 €. Together with your help we want to collect the necessary capital for its production by means of this campaign! If you join in you have a chance to recieve great rewards. For example, anyone that spends 175 $ / 160 € will get one ALBERT CLOCK with 30 % off the latter retail-price. If you want to support us with a smaller amount you still can benefit: If you support us with 1 $ you will get the ALBERT APP on your smartphone, and early birds have a super price of 150 $ / 135 €. (info: all prices are not including delivery, delivery is free in France)</p>

</div></div>","DIMENSIONS ALBERT CLOCK (approximately): w 35 cm h 15 cm d 5 cm What is the Albert Clock?The Albert Clock is a digital wall clock that keeps your brain active and helps to improve the mathematical skills of you and your kids in a playful way. Simply by reading the time. That was too easy for you? No problem! ALBERT grows with you. The better you get, the more you can challenge ALBERT’s levels, like in a video game! Addition and substraction, multiplication and divison can be practiced on four levels of difficulty. 
 
Levels of difficulty
 
 

 
Why the Albert Clock is fun and benefit

Children enjoy racking their brains and making calculations when they’re allowed to take a playful approach. The Albert Clock, however, isn’t exclusively for kids: If you want to get the ALBERT CLOCK for your little ones because of its educational value you might soon as well take pleasure in being put to the test and having to figure out the correct time. Anyone who is interested in Sudoku puzzles and other kinds of brainteasers might also enjoy the ALBERT CLOCK. We can all benefit from this clock. First of all, it’s fun and keeps you mentally fit. Secondly, wouldn’t it be lovely to be able to quickly calculate in your head which product is cheapest per kilo, or what amount should be given as a proper tip?
Time to think - now it's up to you!
The Albert Clock is set to be introduced to the market in March 2016 and will cost approximately 250 Dollars / 225 €. Together with your help we want to collect the necessary capital for its production by means of this campaign! If you join in you have a chance to recieve great rewards. For example, anyone that spends 175 $ / 160 € will get one ALBERT CLOCK with 30 % off the latter retail-price. If you want to support us with a smaller amount you still can benefit: If you support us with 1 $ you will get the ALBERT APP on your smartphone, and early birds have a super price of 150 $ / 135 €. (info: all prices are not including delivery, delivery is free in France)
 

 
Be the first to get your brains on ALBERT! Tell your friends and help us make it happen!


„I've spent many hours in school looking at the time and waiting for it to pass. I regret now that we did not have the Albert Clock hanging on the classroom wall - in order to turn boredom into mental calculation skills!“ Mathieu Lehanneur, designer, Paris, France
""The clock is not only a beautiful minimalist object, it is also a fun and clever intervention into the mundane task of looking up the time. Not just for kids, but for any brain that needs a bit of exercise..."" Sigi Moeslinger, designer, New York, USA

""This could solve a lot of problems. I am serious. I think it is great.“ Zeke Brown, Architect, Boston.
„In school Mathematics isn't any fun – with the Albert Clock, however, it is!“ Chiara, 9 years old, at the Kids Design Week 2015 in Milano, Italy
„I would have been so jealous about it“ Albert E., Scientist and Genius (well, probably)
 
 
Who we are and what we believe in
 


Axel met Fred in 2010, they developed with their complementary skills - product design (A) & software engineering (F) - the project ""tomorrow is another day"" for french designer Mathieu Lehanneur. 4 years later they start to work on several ideas, like the Albert Clock!

<p>Trayvax is the product of a Kickstarter campaign in 2013. We wouldn't be where we are today if it weren't for the support of our incredible customers. Since that campaign, our product line has grown to include five wallets made by a small company of people passionate about quality American-made products. Our designs are functional, sturdy and reliable. Funding this campaign will help us to purchase our own CNC machine so that we can offer newer and more custom outdoor products in order to continue to grow our company.</p>

<h2><strong><em>""A Timeless Gem Meets 21st Century Technology""</em></strong></h2>
<h3>First we want to say ""THANKS"" for having a look at our project!</h3>
<h3>We would like to point out this is a Genuine Cultured Pearl. It is NOT a carved shell.</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p> <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/833929/pictures/full/20130530162811-stupid_thing_copy.jpg?1369956501"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The company is poised and ready to launch this new pearl product. We have 25 years of experience in pearl culturing and technology development. All of our infrastructure, developed technology and operations for this project have been tested and proven at our existing pearl culturing operations in Tahiti. Your support will enable us to mass produce at our farms this beautiful gem.</p>
<h2>Use Of Proceeds:</h2>
<p>We need to purchase specialized equipment to automate some of the processing, Icon Pearls require a different type of finishing than traditional round pearls. Upgrading our processing will reduce finished product costs and delivery time.</p>
<p><em>We are seeking your participation so we can launch mass production and distribution of this unique gem.</em></p>
<h2><strong>What Is an Icon Pearl?</strong></h2>
<p>99.9% of all pearls in the world are cultured. Traditional round pearls are obtained by implanting an oyster with a round <a href=""http://www.americanbiogem.com/brochure.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">shell bead (or nucleus) </a>to grow a round pearl. To culture and grow an Icon Pearl, we had to overcome the natural tendency of the oyster to bury the implant without following any surfaces that were not concentric and smooth. We achieved this by discovering how the biomineralization process works at the nano level as nacre was secreted by the oyster. In layman's terms, we developed an implant and procedure that encourages the oyster to follow very detailed shapes and contours. This science took years of diligent testing and research, and the resulting product is now ready for marketing and distribution.</p>
<p><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/831004/pictures/full/20130525124051-IconPearl_LargeSeaHorse_copy.jpg?1369510857"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: baseline;""/></strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Product Application:</strong></p>
<p>We are not limited in the shapes we can grow. This translates to endless design possibilities. We are able to price this gem from as low as $15.00 per unit to an average price of $85.00 wholesale. This price range allows nearly anyone to enjoy this unique gem.</p>
<h3><strong>Application Examples:</strong></h3>
<p>Jewelry can be created around themes such as nautical designs for tourist destinations in tropical areas, or we can represent any type of theme for fashion, corporate logos, or tailored to the area in which it would be sold. If you're a jeweler and want to create a spectacular piece by compositing shapes to form any size or any contour, we can do it! If you already distribute to retail, or would like to distribute, let us know.</p>

<p>The product is so versatile that the applications are unlimited. Artists and designers now have a way to bring their creations to life in a genuine pearl. ""Gender-Jumping"" the product enables us to reach out to men who, before, were not likely to buy  pearls for themselves. Now we have many available designs that men will enjoy wearing. We are able to reflect designs associated with already existing male products. So come on men, give us some feedback!</p>
<h2><strong>Some History</strong></h2>
<p>American Bio-Gem has developed a breakthrough pearl culturing procedure that allows us to grow custom-designed pearls in any shape imaginable. Our science was developed over years of tests conducted at the prestigious Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego, California, Hubbs Research Center at Sea World, San Diego and The Center for Biological Studies in La Paz, Mexico (CIBNOR). This new jewelry application enables known brands, logos, and recognizable images to be reproduced in pearl form through natural pearl production. Given a brand or image that already has recognized value, we can turn that image into a unique, genuine cultured pearl. Imagine Mickey Mouse, Elvis, the Playboy Bunny, or the Nike ""Swoosh"" in pearl form! This unique jewelry will form the basis of an entirely new market for logos, brands, and images that are realized as cultured pearls. This technology will give custom jewelry designers the ability to create unique designs that will enhance their creative one-of-a-kind custom pieces.</p>

<p><strong>Vision and Mission:</strong></p>
<p>American Bio-Gem supports the ecological and economic value that cultured pearls contribute to developing nations, not only through aquaculture and animal husbandry, but through the increased awareness of marine and freshwater ecology that often accompanies the acquisition of pearls. The Company believes that the <a href=""http://americanbiogem.com/iconpearls.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>Icon Pearls</strong></a> concept provides an exceptional opportunity to leverage the existing value associated with already known brands, icons, and images and to extend that value through the realization of those brands in pearl form. We also believe that as much as the traditional cachet of pearls makes our <a href=""http://americanbiogem.com/iconpearls.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>Icon Pearls</strong></a> product desirable, the Icon Pearls concept will, in turn, be good for the traditional pearl market. We believe that the demand for Icon Pearls will be substantial, and that this demand will provide significant earnings and growth opportunities for the Company and our farming operations. Our mission is to develop this unique business opportunity, manage the introduction and initial growth of the market for <a href=""http://americanbiogem.com/iconpearls.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>Icon Pearls</strong></a> with jewelry distributors and brand owners, and build value in the various regional territories where Icon Pearls can be sold.</p>

First we want to say ""THANKS"" for having a look at our project!
We would like to point out this is a Genuine Cultured Pearl. It is NOT a carved shell.


 
The company is poised and ready to launch this new pearl product. We have 25 years of experience in pearl culturing and technology development. All of our infrastructure, developed technology and operations for this project have been tested and proven at our existing pearl culturing operations in Tahiti. Your support will enable us to mass produce at our farms this beautiful gem.
Use Of Proceeds:
We need to purchase specialized equipment to automate some of the processing, Icon Pearls require a different type of finishing than traditional round pearls. Upgrading our processing will reduce finished product costs and delivery time.
We are seeking your participation so we can launch mass production and distribution of this unique gem.
What Is an Icon Pearl?
99.9% of all pearls in the world are cultured. Traditional round pearls are obtained by implanting an oyster with a round shell bead (or nucleus) to grow a round pearl. To culture and grow an Icon Pearl, we had to overcome the natural tendency of the oyster to bury the implant without following any surfaces that were not concentric and smooth. We achieved this by discovering how the biomineralization process works at the nano level as nacre was secreted by the oyster. In layman's terms, we developed an implant and procedure that encourages the oyster to follow very detailed shapes and contours. This science took years of diligent testing and research, and the resulting product is now ready for marketing and distribution.



Product Application:
We are not limited in the shapes we can grow. This translates to endless design possibilities. We are able to price this gem from as low as $15.00 per unit to an average price of $85.00 wholesale. This price range allows nearly anyone to enjoy this unique gem.
Application Examples:
Jewelry can be created around themes such as nautical designs for tourist destinations in tropical areas, or we can represent any type of theme for fashion, corporate logos, or tailored to the area in which it would be sold. If you're a jeweler and want to create a spectacular piece by compositing shapes to form any size or any contour, we can do it! If you already distribute to retail, or would like to distribute, let us know.

The product is so versatile that the applications are unlimited. Artists and designers now have a way to bring their creations to life in a genuine pearl. ""Gender-Jumping"" the product enables us to reach out to men who, before, were not likely to buy  pearls for themselves. Now we have many available designs that men will enjoy wearing. We are able to reflect designs associated with already existing male products. So come on men, give us some feedback!

Printvid uses improved lenticular printing technology and cloud software. It requires no additional hardware to your devices or inkjet printer. Printvid is highly functional and easy to use: you just launch Printvid Cloud App, take lenticular lens from the box and can start creating anything within minutes.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size: 17px; line-height: 26px;"">The use of both imagery and lens material are inseparable when it comes to making the desired effect come to life in a lenticular print. The image itself is a composite of two or more graphics that are interlaced together. The lens is a unique plastic that is made up of individual lenticules that must be perfectly aligned with the interlaced image underneath it in order for the effect to work.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size: 17px; line-height: 26px;"">Based on the angle of the viewer, each lenticule acts as a magnifying glass to enlarge and display the portion of the image below. Many lenticules working in harmony form the entire lenticular image. In this way, lenticular print can appear to show motion and three-dimensions because each eye is viewing the lenticular print from its own angle.<br/></span><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/246348/files/20131206142712-COMPARE779.png?1386368832"" src="""" style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;""/></p>

<p></p></div>","Printvid is the world’s first full package for making four-dimensional video prints, which can displayed without the use of any electronic devices, special headgear or glasses. This is a new way to preserve your memories, capture life's best moments and just have fun!




Printvid adds two extra dimensions in the printed image: the third dimension is depth and the fourth is time, which allows it to show motion. Printvid is capable of transforming almost all your visual media into a 4D print, which is protected from water, scratches and color fading. Printvid uses improved lenticular printing technology and cloud software. It requires no additional hardware to your devices or inkjet printer. Printvid is highly functional and easy to use: you just launch Printvid Cloud App, take lenticular lens from the box and can start creating anything within minutes.



To spice up our start we want to give an exclusive opportunity to Indiegogo backers - to break the World Record! Together we can build the Tallest Lenticular Hologram in the World (see details below)!


















































Great classic sizes (4x4"", 4x6"" and 6x8"") of lenticular lens included in the box. They are all equally good for printing in 4D, including photos, videos and computer-generated imagery, but there are some more features:
Instavid 4x4"" is also good for making cool square 4D printvids from social networks, creation of animated magnets and other fun things like holiday decorations, toys, souvenirs and stickers. 
Mixvid 4x6"" is also good for creation of greeting cards and crafting things like 4D cases for smartphones and tablets.
Bigvid 6x8"" is also good for printing HD videos, movies, photo presentations, 3D scenes and large scale crafting.
For sophisticated designs you can easily adjust shape of your lenticular sheets, so you can create 4D printvids of any form and size for any purpose. Technical drawings for 4D iPhone wraps, Christmas decorations, toys and other amazing things included!



With Printvid Cloud App you can easily prepare photos and videos for 4D printing: edit your content, apply filters and effects, add text and frames and then transform it to the interlaced image, ready for the 4D printing. Use Printvid anywhere you want and create 4D images on the go. This is a web based application, so you can enjoy the cross-platform workflow. For example, you could shoot video with an iPhone, customize it on Android tablet and then complete the 4D file on your PC. Now it is so easy and flexible!

Printvid Cloud App ships with a lot of templates and filters, so you can customize your 4D printvids in the way you want: add some fun, make it retro, create cards, invitations, toys ... be imaginative! On top of that there is a 1-year subscription to all new additional templates, effects and other exclusive content.









The use of both imagery and lens material are inseparable when it comes to making the desired effect come to life in a lenticular print. The image itself is a composite of two or more graphics that are interlaced together. The lens is a unique plastic that is made up of individual lenticules that must be perfectly aligned with the interlaced image underneath it in order for the effect to work.






Based on the angle of the viewer, each lenticule acts as a magnifying glass to enlarge and display the portion of the image below. Many lenticules working in harmony form the entire lenticular image. In this way, lenticular print can appear to show motion and three-dimensions because each eye is viewing the lenticular print from its own angle.

Printvid with Perspective Stabilization (PS) function can produce incredibly vibrant and clear 4D prints. This function automatically adjusts the image viewing angle: when you look at the image under 30 degrees angle, the image will look like the viewer's angle is 0 degrees.


Upload your videos and photos to Printvid Cloud App from smartphones, tablets or computers.
Design is an extra, unless it’s used from the beginning. For example, you can use special templates, filters, insert digital frames or any other additional elements. 






















Printvid App places frames in order and creates the file for printing. It is mostly a mathematical formula that slices images to the right width and arranges them accordingly.
For better understanding of theory there is a simple example of 2 frames interlacement for ""flip"" effect:



Then interlaced image is printed on special paper and combined with the lenticular lens - now your 4D printvid is ready!  Continuing our example:







Crafting is also an extra, because you already have a beautiful 4D print. But if you wish there is a lot more things you can do with Printvid - it can be trimmed as paper or cardboard, glued, grooved, die-cut or mounted on other surfaces, transformed into magnets or stickers. It also can be used for creation of appliques, decor elements, jewelry and scrapbooking. This technology is so versatile, that you can easily invent new ways of use!







Printvid works perfectly with most inkjet printers having 300+ DPI (dots per inch) printing capability. Almost all printers today are capable of printing 1200 to 4800 DPI. Inkjet printers with higher DPI allow using more frames per 4D print, which means you can make longer animations and better depth effects.









We are pleased to announce that every Indiegogo founder can participate in the building of the World Tallest Lenticular Hologram! How tall will it be? Our proposition is to make it at least 1000 meters (3280 feet) tall. Yeah, that's right, it will be ten times higher than Statue of Liberty, higher than The Tallest Building in the World Burj Khalifa and even twice longer than diameter of Saturn's moon Aegaeon! It can be even taller - everything is up to you. Such a gigantic hologram is itself a remarkable thing, but what makes it even better - this is a worldwide record breaking event for technology enthusiasts, the ones who want to create something special and inspire others by making such an amazing achievement. Current record of largest lenticular hologram is 78 meters, let's break it together!With every Printvid Pack we will send you 5 invitations for the participation in the Record Breaking Event, so if your family, friends or colleagues wish to take part, they can do it.The idea is that the Hologram will be made of thousands of smaller 4D lenticular images created by early adopters from around the world. So each participant can create some beautiful 4D printvids and send it for participation in the event, where it will take its honorable place within the gigantic lenticular Hologram. Each participant and supporter will the get Official Record Breaker Certificate, place on the Record Breakers Page (where you could track the location of your 4D image within the Hologram) and, of course, report from the Event!What are the shipping costs? If you live in the US or the UK, shipping is free. For all other destinations, please add the amount specified in the perk description. Another thing you might want to consider though is what the import fees or duties will be on your end. These vary by country and we can't cover them.If I am purchasing multiple add-ons, do I need to pay separate shipping for each item?No, there is a free shipment for all add-ons with main Printvid Pack (we do not ship add-ons separately during this campaign).How do I upgrade my perk?No problem, just click CONTRIBUTE NOW and put in the difference you need to pay to upgrade. Select ""No perk, I just want to contribute."" Pay for it and email us at the below to inform us of the change.I would like to buy the add-ons too, can I do that in 1 contribution?Unfortunately, you will have to fill in several separate contributions (depending on number of add-ons or Packs needed).Can anyone set up Printvid?Yes! Printvid was designed with the purpose of making lenticular printing easy and accessible for everyone.How to make 4D printvids larger than 8x12"", if my printer physically cannot print larger images?Firstly, you can use compound printing technique - make the lenticular image in Printvid software, break it into several parts smaller than 8x12"", print them separately and combine printed images with the lenticular sheet.Secondly, you can use outsource printing - make the lenticular image in Printvid software, order needed print size from local photo printing service and combine printed image with the lenticular sheet.Is it eco-friendly?The lenticular lenses that we use are made of PET plastics, which are 100% recyclable. Lenses can be ground and shredded for reuse as post-consumer material by most recycling operations. Printvid is proud to be a part of those actively involved in safeguarding our environment. We believe it is the responsibility of each one of us to develop ideas, trends, and technologies in ways that respect the environment and its inhabitants.How Record Breaker perk can actually lengthen Hologram?This perk allow us to produce and add one more lenticular print into the Hologram, so every bit helps!How often will I get new templates on Printvid Plus subscription?Every 2-3 weeks.How many templates available at launch?The amount is specified in perk descriptions. Plus there will be weekly updates, so during the first year from launch there will be over 500 design templates.Can I purchase Instavid, Mixvid, Bigvid and other material packages after the Printvid campaign? First we will ship all Indiegogo orders at very special prices. After that we will introduce a great variety of additional material packages including new print sizes, different shapes and more functionality (for example, smartphone and tablet cases).If I have further questions where can I contact Printvid? You can reach us at contact@printvid.com",53.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Power in LADYBAG</h3> <p></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">What powers
LADYBAG is a high capacity 8000 mAh battery. With this power one can charge up
to three electrical devices at one time, providing long lasting battery power
to ones devices throughout the day. The 1A and 2A USB connections allow women
with apple products and other phones and tablets to charge from their Ladybag up to 4 full times
a day, while the 4.75 mm jack plug connector is used to recharge your heating
pad. Once recharged, this Ladybag battery allows the heating pad to work for
almost 3 hours at a time on maximum heat and minimally half an hour more on minimum heat.</span><br/></p>

<h3>Activating the heating pad</h3> <p></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Turning on the heating pad is extremely
simple. Just connect the cable to the battery and turn the battery into the
“on” position (the blue light with sign 12V will appear on the battery). Once
you see the switch inside of the bag blinking, that means the bag is starting
to heat up. There are three levels of heating and you can change the
temperature by slightly pushing the switch inside the bag. You can also turn
the heating off using the same switch with which you change the temperature. Or
you can turn it off by turning off the battery. There is no need to deal with
portable hand warmers or unstylish gloves, you can warm your hands and body up
with your own trendy handbag.</span></p>

<p><span>We want to bring this unique product to you and other women
around the world. Keeping your iPads and iPhones charged, staying warm and
looking stylish is the goal of LADYBAG. Women are busy working, traveling and
taking care of their children and need to stay connected, while spotting the
latest fashion trends and high-quality handbags. </span></p>
<h3><b>Design</b></h3>
<p>Each of the handbags has the latest trends combined
with our unique designs. So far, there are four different designs of LADYBAG,
but more designs are being introduced daily as the trends of the handbag market
change. Each LADYBAG is produced with the highest quality leather and allows
each customer to choose their style and color of the bag. Some LADYBAGS are
more small, chic and elegant – for the working lady, or bigger, relaxed and
casual – for the moms who need extra space. Order multiple LADYBAG’s in different
styles and colors to go with your outfit each day, while not worrying about
being cold or your electronics dying on you. <br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><b>OUR history</b></h3>
<p>LADYBAG has been a work
in progress for many years. At first, we ordered parts individually and would
put together these bags for our family members and friends as holiday or
birthday gifts. Once, we started to see the usefulness of these bags and
started receiving great feedback, we realized this idea could benefit working
women around the world. Once we started sketching designs and forming
relationships with the raw material manufacturers (we changed a few of them in
order to get the top quality and are cooperating now only with the best ones),
LADYBAG began to become a concrete product and not just an idea. Once a few of
the bag designs were in our hands, we hired a professional for a photo shoot so
we could spread the world about LADYBAG on worldwide social media networks. We
now have a facebook page. Twitter and Pinterest page. The word is spreading
around the world and we need your help to continue spreading our idea! Please
share this campaign with all your friends, family and colleagues and “like” our
facebook page. Become a part of the LADYBAG story and help us find LADYBAG
enthusiasts worldwide get connected.”</p>
<p></p>
<h3><b>Where are we now?</b></h3>
<p>We are currently at the stage of launching our fully
operational sample handbags into the high-end handbag market. We have tested
the raw materials and components of the handbags for durability, reliability
and functionality for the long-term. We are confident that our materials will
meet each customers conditions and will be a product that lasts. We have created
our first four lines of bags that vary from casual and sporty to chic and elegant. We
are continuing to test the products used in the bags, modifying the style and
improving the electronic parts. In December, we will officially launch our products on
the handbag market and will hopefully produce enough bags to meet the rising
demand.</p>
<h3><b>Delivery Details </b></h3>
<p>As we are still in the manufacturing stage of our
handbag line, for all pre-orders it will take approximately 4 months to receive
your LADYBAG. The parts of the bag are manufactured from the highest quality and
most trusted factories around the world, then assembled and shipped from Czech
Republic. We want your bag to be of the highest quality and functionality
before it arrives at your doorstep, so please allow 4 months from the time of
order. Make sure to order your LADYBAG in time for the holidays, cold months or
as a perfect Christmas present.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><b>FAQ</b></h3>
<p><i><u>How can the handbag
heat and charge?</u></i></p>
<p>In our unique handbag is incorporated a heating system. On 
outside and the design you will hardly recognize anything as the heating secret is hidden in the
outside pocket. Two incorporated heating pads ensure that your hands or butt will
get quickly warmed up whenever you need it. The source of energy comes from our LADYBAG
battery witch has a very modern design and will not only enable giving off the heat by
the heating pads but at the same time it is able to charge both your phone and
tablet.</p>
<p><i><u>Can the </u></i><u>LADYBAG
battery</u> <i><u>charge any tablet or
phone?</u></i></p>
<p>Yes, it can! The LADYBAG battery has 2 USB ports where you
can connect the cable of your phone and tablet from any brand.</p>
<p><i><u>Can the </u></i><u>LADYBAG
battery</u> <i><u>heat the bag and charge
both phone and tablet at the same time?</u></i></p>
<p>Yes. Our unique LADYBAG battery has a capacity of 8 000 mAh,
enabling you to charge multiple electronic devices, while using the heating
portion to warm your hands up when it is cold. All of this without ruining the
leather of the bag or heating the contents inside of the handbag.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><i><u>Dou you sell the
LADYBAG only with a European plug? </u></i></p>
<p>No we deliver the product with a European plug for EU
customers and with an American plug for US customers.</p>
<p><i><u>What are the safety features of the bag since it deals
with heat?</u></i></p>
<p>LADYBAG is made with
only the top quality leather and electronic devices. The leather has
successfully been tested with the electronic parts on maximum power inside. The
leather does not melt or become so hot it could burn someone. We have gone to
extensive measures to make the LADYBAGS with top quality materials to ensure
safety to our customers, as well as a trendy handbag to carry around.</p>
<p><i><u>What will you use
the money for?</u></i></p>
<p>So far we have invested a lot of money in the development of the
product, production of the Alfa and Beta prototypes, its testing and
improvements. We also invested in patent and trade mark applications and in
quality and safety testing. Now we need to pay for certification of the product
and the LADYBAG is ready for you to enjoy it. We want to bring this unique
product to as many women as possible and here we need your help. We are aware
of the fact that without your help it would be hard to spread the LADYBAG
worldwide as our sources are limited. We will use all the money granted for:</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>ordering the components and production of bags
(the more we order, the better the price, which will enable us to invest more
in development)</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>testing of each bag</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>certification by the authorities</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>logistic (logistic by higher volumes is much
cheaper)</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>further development</p>
<p><span>-<span> 
</span></span>based on the demand from countries we will make
local web pages </p>
<p><i><u>Other ways you can help:</u></i></p>
<p>Besides monetary
support of LADYBAG we are just as appreciative of those who help us spread the
word about this unique product! One can share the link from our Indiegogo campaign
page through e-mail, twitter, facebook or Pinterest. Send the information to
your family, friends and colleagues to help us garner support for LADYBAG. We
will acknowledge and thank anyone who shares our product, as you are adding so
much value to the LADYBAG product.</p>
<p><i><u>I wear in my
handbag cosmetics and sometimes even chocolate, can´t they melt from the
heating?



</u></i></p>
<p>You don´t have to worry at all, we incorporated the heating
pads into the outside pocket which has isolation foam on the inner side of the
bag. The inner part is therefore well protected. It can get a bit warmer but
definitely not so warm that it would melt your make up. <br/></p>
<p><i><u>How do I tell you about my personalized
message?</u></i></p>
<p>Please make sure that after ordering your perk you send an e-mail to <a href=""mailto:ladybag@ladybag.cz"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ladybag@ladybag.cz</a> where you will write us
which text you wish to have imprinted on the bag.</p>
<p><i><u>How much should I
add for shipping?</u></i></p>
<p>Please add: $ 15 Europe, $30 World</p>
<p><i><u>Is the shoulder strap part of each
LADYBAG? And is it adjustable and removable?</u></i></p>
<p>Yes, it is. Only the LADYBAG Iron Lady has due to its design a strap which
is not removable.</p>
<p></p>

you can warm up your hands even while walking or standing. The heating pads work on 12V voltage and are on
the outside pocket of the bag so that the inside part will stay cool. The
outside pocket is where the heating pad is located. You can either unzip the
pocket partly to slip your hands in or unzip the pocket fully and fold it down
to sit on.


Are you waiting outside in the park
for a friend? 
Or outside of school for your children? 
Unzip your Ladybag pocket
to sit on while you wait in the cold winter months.



Power in LADYBAG 
What powers
LADYBAG is a high capacity 8000 mAh battery. With this power one can charge up
to three electrical devices at one time, providing long lasting battery power
to ones devices throughout the day. The 1A and 2A USB connections allow women
with apple products and other phones and tablets to charge from their Ladybag up to 4 full times
a day, while the 4.75 mm jack plug connector is used to recharge your heating
pad. Once recharged, this Ladybag battery allows the heating pad to work for
almost 3 hours at a time on maximum heat and minimally half an hour more on minimum heat.





Activating the heating pad 
Turning on the heating pad is extremely
simple. Just connect the cable to the battery and turn the battery into the
“on” position (the blue light with sign 12V will appear on the battery). Once
you see the switch inside of the bag blinking, that means the bag is starting
to heat up. There are three levels of heating and you can change the
temperature by slightly pushing the switch inside the bag. You can also turn
the heating off using the same switch with which you change the temperature. Or
you can turn it off by turning off the battery. There is no need to deal with
portable hand warmers or unstylish gloves, you can warm your hands and body up
with your own trendy handbag.

We want to bring this unique product to you and other women
around the world. Keeping your iPads and iPhones charged, staying warm and
looking stylish is the goal of LADYBAG. Women are busy working, traveling and
taking care of their children and need to stay connected, while spotting the
latest fashion trends and high-quality handbags. 
Design
Each of the handbags has the latest trends combined
with our unique designs. So far, there are four different designs of LADYBAG,
but more designs are being introduced daily as the trends of the handbag market
change. Each LADYBAG is produced with the highest quality leather and allows
each customer to choose their style and color of the bag. Some LADYBAGS are
more small, chic and elegant – for the working lady, or bigger, relaxed and
casual – for the moms who need extra space. Order multiple LADYBAG’s in different
styles and colors to go with your outfit each day, while not worrying about
being cold or your electronics dying on you. 


OUR history
LADYBAG has been a work
in progress for many years. At first, we ordered parts individually and would
put together these bags for our family members and friends as holiday or
birthday gifts. Once, we started to see the usefulness of these bags and
started receiving great feedback, we realized this idea could benefit working
women around the world. Once we started sketching designs and forming
relationships with the raw material manufacturers (we changed a few of them in
order to get the top quality and are cooperating now only with the best ones),
LADYBAG began to become a concrete product and not just an idea. Once a few of
the bag designs were in our hands, we hired a professional for a photo shoot so
we could spread the world about LADYBAG on worldwide social media networks. We
now have a facebook page. Twitter and Pinterest page. The word is spreading
around the world and we need your help to continue spreading our idea! Please
share this campaign with all your friends, family and colleagues and “like” our
facebook page. Become a part of the LADYBAG story and help us find LADYBAG
enthusiasts worldwide get connected.”

Where are we now?
We are currently at the stage of launching our fully
operational sample handbags into the high-end handbag market. We have tested
the raw materials and components of the handbags for durability, reliability
and functionality for the long-term. We are confident that our materials will
meet each customers conditions and will be a product that lasts. We have created
our first four lines of bags that vary from casual and sporty to chic and elegant. We
are continuing to test the products used in the bags, modifying the style and
improving the electronic parts. In December, we will officially launch our products on
the handbag market and will hopefully produce enough bags to meet the rising
demand.
Delivery Details 
As we are still in the manufacturing stage of our
handbag line, for all pre-orders it will take approximately 4 months to receive
your LADYBAG. The parts of the bag are manufactured from the highest quality and
most trusted factories around the world, then assembled and shipped from Czech
Republic. We want your bag to be of the highest quality and functionality
before it arrives at your doorstep, so please allow 4 months from the time of
order. Make sure to order your LADYBAG in time for the holidays, cold months or
as a perfect Christmas present.


FAQ
How can the handbag
heat and charge?
In our unique handbag is incorporated a heating system. On 
outside and the design you will hardly recognize anything as the heating secret is hidden in the
outside pocket. Two incorporated heating pads ensure that your hands or butt will
get quickly warmed up whenever you need it. The source of energy comes from our LADYBAG
battery witch has a very modern design and will not only enable giving off the heat by
the heating pads but at the same time it is able to charge both your phone and
tablet.
Can the LADYBAG
battery charge any tablet or
phone?
Yes, it can! The LADYBAG battery has 2 USB ports where you
can connect the cable of your phone and tablet from any brand.
Can the LADYBAG
battery heat the bag and charge
both phone and tablet at the same time?
Yes. Our unique LADYBAG battery has a capacity of 8 000 mAh,
enabling you to charge multiple electronic devices, while using the heating
portion to warm your hands up when it is cold. All of this without ruining the
leather of the bag or heating the contents inside of the handbag.


Dou you sell the
LADYBAG only with a European plug? 
No we deliver the product with a European plug for EU
customers and with an American plug for US customers.
What are the safety features of the bag since it deals
with heat?
LADYBAG is made with
only the top quality leather and electronic devices. The leather has
successfully been tested with the electronic parts on maximum power inside. The
leather does not melt or become so hot it could burn someone. We have gone to
extensive measures to make the LADYBAGS with top quality materials to ensure
safety to our customers, as well as a trendy handbag to carry around.
What will you use
the money for?
So far we have invested a lot of money in the development of the
product, production of the Alfa and Beta prototypes, its testing and
improvements. We also invested in patent and trade mark applications and in
quality and safety testing. Now we need to pay for certification of the product
and the LADYBAG is ready for you to enjoy it. We want to bring this unique
product to as many women as possible and here we need your help. We are aware
of the fact that without your help it would be hard to spread the LADYBAG
worldwide as our sources are limited. We will use all the money granted for:
- 
ordering the components and production of bags
(the more we order, the better the price, which will enable us to invest more
in development)
- 
testing of each bag
- 
certification by the authorities
- 
logistic (logistic by higher volumes is much
cheaper)
- 
further development
- 
based on the demand from countries we will make
local web pages 
Other ways you can help:
Besides monetary
support of LADYBAG we are just as appreciative of those who help us spread the
word about this unique product! One can share the link from our Indiegogo campaign
page through e-mail, twitter, facebook or Pinterest. Send the information to
your family, friends and colleagues to help us garner support for LADYBAG. We
will acknowledge and thank anyone who shares our product, as you are adding so
much value to the LADYBAG product.
I wear in my
handbag cosmetics and sometimes even chocolate, can´t they melt from the
heating?




You don´t have to worry at all, we incorporated the heating
pads into the outside pocket which has isolation foam on the inner side of the
bag. The inner part is therefore well protected. It can get a bit warmer but
definitely not so warm that it would melt your make up. 
How do I tell you about my personalized
message?
Please make sure that after ordering your perk you send an e-mail to ladybag@ladybag.cz where you will write us
which text you wish to have imprinted on the bag.
How much should I
add for shipping?
Please add: $ 15 Europe, $30 World
Is the shoulder strap part of each
LADYBAG? And is it adjustable and removable?
Yes, it is. Only the LADYBAG Iron Lady has due to its design a strap which
is not removable.





We need your help!




Thank you again for
visiting our Indiegogo campaign! We hope that after you have read a little more
about our new product, you are as excited about it as we are. Please feel free

For the CO2  that we do produce we then offset this by planting trees which will soak up CO2 as they grow.</p><p><strong>One Tree Per Jacket</strong> – We want to do more than just offset our emissions, so we have teamed up with <a href=""https://www.forestcarbon.co.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Forest Carbon</a> to plant 1 extra tree for every jacket sold in a local woodland in the Scottish Borders. These woodlands can regulate water quality and supply, reduce soil erosion, stabilise riverbanks and mitigate flooding.</p><p><strong>Transportation </strong>– CO2 emissions linked to transportation can represent 50% of the total carbon impact of a product &amp; transporting goods by air can produce as much as 100 times as  by sea. Our fabric mill, factory and distribution headquarters are all based in Europe to minimise transportation and we try to use the least polluting modes of transport available.</p><p><strong>Made to last</strong> – Fast fashion has become one of the largest contributors to pollution from the clothing industry. It usually involves vast transportation, more polluting manufacturing methods and isn't made to last. We don’t want to be a part of that, so our jackets are made to last and we’ve made timeless styles that will look good in your wardrobe for years to come.</p><p><strong>Lifetime repair</strong> – In line with creating our products to be made to last, we are offering a lifetime repair service on all of our product. If there is any wear and tear, then send it back to us and for a nominal handling charge we will fix it up and get it right back to you.</p><p><strong>No Harmful Chemicals</strong> – Our mills do not use of PFC (linked to cancer and birth defects) or other harmful chemicals and are committed to the ZDHC roadmap to tackling the issue of hazardous chemicals in the textile supply chain. The leather straps we use for our saddle bag are tanned with vegetable tannins rather than the more common and harmful Chromium.</p><p><strong>Factory</strong> – We believe that its really important to know where your clothes are getting made, especially in the wake of the Rana Plaza disaster in 2013. Our fabric comes from a family run mill in Italy and we are happy to work with a specialist performance factory in Sofia that we’ve visited during development of our products and can trust in their high standards.  </p><p><strong>Constant Improvement</strong> – To us this is just the start. We are constantly learning and know we can do better, so we are committed to constantly strive to have as little negative effect as possible and have as much positive effect as we can on the world we live in.</p><p> </p><h3>OUR BUSINESS MODEL</h3><p>By working direct with the manufacturer and selling direct to the consumer we’re able to offer quality design and high performance Italian fabrics for a fair price. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://static1.squarespace.com/static/580e1a9f2e69cf7b57c82a8c/t/5ae61a3baa4a99e1420bf6ef/1525029445555/Chart+Gif.gif"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h3>OUR STORY</h3><p>We’re Jill and Steve, the team behind Meander.

Our fabric mill, factory and distribution headquarters are all based in Europe to minimise transportation and we try to use the least polluting modes of transport available.Made to last – Fast fashion has become one of the largest contributors to pollution from the clothing industry. It usually involves vast transportation, more polluting manufacturing methods and isn't made to last. We don’t want to be a part of that, so our jackets are made to last and we’ve made timeless styles that will look good in your wardrobe for years to come.Lifetime repair – In line with creating our products to be made to last, we are offering a lifetime repair service on all of our product. If there is any wear and tear, then send it back to us and for a nominal handling charge we will fix it up and get it right back to you.No Harmful Chemicals – Our mills do not use of PFC (linked to cancer and birth defects) or other harmful chemicals and are committed to the ZDHC roadmap to tackling the issue of hazardous chemicals in the textile supply chain. The leather straps we use for our saddle bag are tanned with vegetable tannins rather than the more common and harmful Chromium.Factory – We believe that its really important to know where your clothes are getting made, especially in the wake of the Rana Plaza disaster in 2013. Our fabric comes from a family run mill in Italy and we are happy to work with a specialist performance factory in Sofia that we’ve visited during development of our products and can trust in their high standards.  Constant Improvement – To us this is just the start. We are constantly learning and know we can do better, so we are committed to constantly strive to have as little negative effect as possible and have as much positive effect as we can on the world we live in. OUR BUSINESS MODELBy working direct with the manufacturer and selling direct to the consumer we’re able to offer quality design and high performance Italian fabrics for a fair price.  OUR STORYWe’re Jill and Steve, the team behind Meander. We’re cyclists and adventurers based in Edinburgh, Scotland with backgrounds in fashion and engineering.A couple of years ago, we organised a charity cycle from London to Paris an had the idea to start Meander,  we were looking for stylish and functional cycle wear but we couldn’t find it. We weren’t racing but going on a journey with friends and wanted one jacket that was both stylish and functional but it didn’t exist.  We found a lot of bright neon jackets and unflattering lycra which got us asking, Why are most cycling brands catering for people racing – when most cyclists don’t race?After two years of research, development, fabric sourcing and countless prototypes, we’re excited to bring our product to life and start the Meander journey.   TEAM                                       CONTACTIf you have any questions, comments  we’d love to hear from you.

<p><i>The 42mm diamenter case is made by 316L Stainless Steel. Stainless steels are notable for their corrosion resistance, which increases with increasing chromium content.

<p>Filanthropic

are selfish or doing harm but expect those do are doing good to work for free
or at least on a shoe string budget!</p>
<p>We started
thinking about the possibilities of changing charity and changing business at

regular lifestyle brand? Can a business have something other than pure profit
at its core? We believe that the answer to both questions is “yes”.  Some call that style with a soul. We call it:</p>

<h4>What is Filanthropic? </h4>
<p>We are a clothing company committed to producing
and selling high quality, super cool clothing and then using the profits in a
socially responsible way.  We operate
with a revolutionary vision that blends fashion and philanthropy without
sacrificing either.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p>
<h4><b>Why Indiegogo?</b></h4>
<p>We want every step of our journey to
be shared by our supporters, we want this to be a movement that our customers can literally own and we want to build
the business with your help.  (We did think about using Kickstarter but we
were informed that as we want to donate some of our profits rather than spend
them on Rolexes or fast cars, we don’t comply with their policies!)</p>
<h4><b>Why not donate 100% of the profits?</b></h4>
<p>We arent satisfied with giving a few thousand
dollars, we want to give millions. To do that we need to grow the business and
you can't do that if you give away every cent you make! Our dream is to reach a
level where we can give away $1,000,000 a month, to turn that dream into
reality we need to grow massively and for that we need capital. </p>
<h4><b>What will the proceeds be used for?</b></h4>
<p>Besides producing your shirt we will be using the
proceeds to build a kick ass web store, commission new designs, and fund our
first sustainable development project in collaboration with Project Red, El
Salvador (and many more if we reach our stretch goals!).</p><h3></h3><p>

What is Filanthropic? 
We are a clothing company committed to producing
and selling high quality, super cool clothing and then using the profits in a
socially responsible way.  We operate
with a revolutionary vision that blends fashion and philanthropy without
sacrificing either.

Why Indiegogo?
We want every step of our journey to
be shared by our supporters, we want this to be a movement that our customers can literally own and we want to build
the business with your help.  (We did think about using Kickstarter but we
were informed that as we want to donate some of our profits rather than spend
them on Rolexes or fast cars, we don’t comply with their policies!)
Why not donate 100% of the profits?
We arent satisfied with giving a few thousand
dollars, we want to give millions. To do that we need to grow the business and
you can't do that if you give away every cent you make! Our dream is to reach a
level where we can give away $1,000,000 a month, to turn that dream into
reality we need to grow massively and for that we need capital. 
What will the proceeds be used for?
Besides producing your shirt we will be using the
proceeds to build a kick ass web store, commission new designs, and fund our
first sustainable development project in collaboration with Project Red, El
Salvador (and many more if we reach our stretch goals!).

3 NEW DESIGNS NOW AVAILABLE!To see more image of the shirts visit our galleryWhat are they made of?
100% ringspun cotton.
What’s the quality like?
Excellent.  We are confident in saying that they will compare favorably with any other t-shirt you own. Quality is a huge priority for us.  We want you to buy Filanthropic because it’s your favourite; philanthropy is our passion so we don’t expect you to have to sacrifice anything (and we'll never use a sweatshop)!

What size should I order?
The men’s shirts are pretty standard sizes, so if you are normally a European Large you can expect to fit into a Filanthropic Large.  The women’s are a little undersized so we recommend you order a size up from your normal European size unless you like a figure hugging look.
Who did the designs?For our launch range we worked with two incredibly talented designers who have both been fantastic to work with.  The slogan designs were done by Tadas Ciudaras from Lithuania and the illustrations are the work of Lei Melendres from the Phillipines.  Go and check out their work, they really are amazing.

When will I receive my t-shirt?
The campaign will close at the end of March and we will ship all orders by the end of April.

<p><strong>BENZAK DENIM DEVELOPERS</strong></p>
<p>Benzak Denim Developers is an Amsterdam based denim brand, founded and solely run by Lennaert Nijgh, aka Benzak.</p>
<p>Out of the passion for jeans and inspired by the unique fading capabilities of denim, BDD was born. Rather than seasonal collections, BDD develops timeless pieces that can go anytime, anywhere.</p>
<p>By wear and wash the denim of your pair will develop its personal character. No single pair will be the same. <strong>Be the developer of your denim and become part of the world of Benzak</strong>. </p>
<p>The BDD range also contains leather products, mixed with the BDD signature denim, to create the best of both worlds. The leather used is vegetable tanned and evolves into a highly unique and personal product by wear, just like the denim.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHERE IS BDD NOW?</strong></p>
<p>The last couple of years I have been working on the BDD brand in the form of individual projects: 1 item at the time, such as a pair of jeans or a leather wallet, to be released in limited quantities. During these years I have gained enough knowledge and experience to take the <strong>next big step</strong>: create a <strong>'capsule' collection</strong> of various timeless garments and items of the highest quality that go seamlessly well together.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>THE ORIGINAL 6 POCKET JEANS</strong></p>
<p>Most jeans as we know feature 5 pockets: 2 on the back, 2 on the front and 1 extra at the facing of the right front pocket. This extra pocket, commonly known as the <strong>coin pocket</strong>, was used to carry small objects, such as coins, a watch or even nuggets of gold. The modern day cowboy often carries a bit more to that, thus BDD introduces a standard <strong>6th pocket</strong> - a hidden pocket at the facing of the left front pocket, only noticable by the exposed selvedge at the top, just under the waistband. I simply call this:</p>
<p><strong>‘The evolution of a classic.’</strong></p>

<h1>What's with the MVMT?</h1>
<p>Our team sought out to create MVMT because of our passion for watches and desire to cut out the brand inflation and retail markup of popular name brands.  We got frustrated paying hundreds of dollars for name brand watches, knowing they only cost a fraction of the price to make.  We have spent the past year working with leaders in the industry to come up with an affordable, stylish looking watch collection that we know everyone will love.</p>
<p>When designing this watch collection, we made sure of THREE details:</p>
<ul>
<li>A minimalist look that could be worn in a casual or professional setting.</li>
<li>The highest quality materials.</li>
<li>Offering the watches at a price less than half what our competitor's cost.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>

<h1>The MVMT Collection</h1>
<p>For our first collection, we are offering SIX different models to choose from.</p>
<p> <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/ps7hP3U.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h1> </h1>
<h1>MVMT is also backed with a warranty.</h1>
<p>We are so confident with the quality and durability of our watches, that if something were to happen within the first 2 years, we hope you will send it back to us.  Warranty includes all internal parts of the watch.</p>
<p>Warranty does not cover:  </p>
<ul>
<li>The life of the battery </li>
<li>Wear and tear and aging (e.g. scratched crystal; alteration of the color and/or material of non metallic straps and chains, such as leather, textile, rubber; peeling of the plating) </li>
<li>Any damage on any part of the watch resulting from abnormal/abusive use, lack of care, negligence, accidents (knocks dents, crushing, broken crystal, etc.) </li>
</ul>
<h1>Where is the MVMT headed?</h1>
<p>We want a full line of different types and styled watches that stay at an AFFORDABLE cost. So join with us on this journey and be apart of it every step of the way.  We will send out several updates throughout the entire process making sure our backers are up-to-date on any important information.  We want to create a bond, a synergy with our backers, because ultimately you are the ones turning our dream into a reality.  We are excited to grow and anxious to see what the future has in store for us.</p>
<h1>Who is the team and how did it all start?</h1>
<p><span>Started by young entrepreneurs and watch enthusiasts Jake, and Kramer sought to cut out the brand inflation and retail markup of popular name brands. We have been obsessed with watches our entire life and got fed up paying for overpriced name brand watches. So now we're doing it ourselves. We started as friends, became roommates, and are now hoping to become business partners. </span></p>

<h1><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/VmQXrjX.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></h1>
<h1>We Need Your Support!</h1>
<p>In order to turn this dream of ours into a reality, we need your support. Not only does this mean pledging for one of our awesome watches, but sharing the story with a friend. The important thing to remember with IndieGogo is, if we don't reach our full funding goal....we get nothing. </p>
<p>We are going to do everything we can to spread the word in a variety of ways.  We hope through the use of social media and blogs we can drive enough outside traffic to our page which will result in us reaching our funding goal.  If you could do something as simple as tweeting about our page, or just liking our Facebook page, it can really go a long way. Simply click the Facebook and Twitter tabs at the top ^ of the page, right below the video.</p>
<h1>If funded, how will you fulfill the orders?</h1>
<p>We've tweaked the initial prototype, finalized our design, purchased the molds and selected a manufacturer that has a great reputation in the industry.  Once Indiegogo releases the funds, we can pay the initial deposit to begin production.  Production time takes roughly 30 days depending on the quantity of the order.  Our team will then ship the orders to our awesome backers! We have experience with shipping software and thermal printers which should make for a very smooth process. </p>
<h1><em>(It is TIME for the MVMT)</em></h1>
<p>From all of us here at MVMT, thanks for helping us kickstart this project.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 class=""dotty""><span>Risks and challenges</span></h3>
<p>The challenges of MVMT Watches will be getting the word out, and convincing IndieGogos to participate. With so many great projects to choose from, we hope ours will stand apart from the rest. To reach as many people as possible, we are asking friends, families, and various blogs to help spread the word.</p>
<p>Once the funding is in place, the challenge will be producing on a large scale. Depending on outside help is difficult, but we have been dealing with a manufacturer for months and have established a solid relationship, which has has given us a lot of confidence in them.</p></span></span></span></span></div>","OR Visit our website www.mvmtwatches.com

Our team sought out to create MVMT because of our passion for watches and desire to cut out the brand inflation and retail markup of popular name brands.  We got frustrated paying hundreds of dollars for name brand watches, knowing they only cost a fraction of the price to make.  We have spent the past year working with leaders in the industry to come up with an affordable, stylish looking watch collection that we know everyone will love.
When designing this watch collection, we made sure of THREE details:

A minimalist look that could be worn in a casual or professional setting.
The highest quality materials.
Offering the watches at a price less than half what our competitor's cost.

 



The MVMT Collection
For our first collection, we are offering SIX different models to choose from.
 





 
MVMT is also backed with a warranty.
We are so confident with the quality and durability of our watches, that if something were to happen within the first 2 years, we hope you will send it back to us.  Warranty includes all internal parts of the watch.
Warranty does not cover:  

The life of the battery 
Wear and tear and aging (e.g. scratched crystal; alteration of the color and/or material of non metallic straps and chains, such as leather, textile, rubber; peeling of the plating) 
Any damage on any part of the watch resulting from abnormal/abusive use, lack of care, negligence, accidents (knocks dents, crushing, broken crystal, etc.) 

Where is the MVMT headed?
We want a full line of different types and styled watches that stay at an AFFORDABLE cost. So join with us on this journey and be apart of it every step of the way.  We will send out several updates throughout the entire process making sure our backers are up-to-date on any important information.  We want to create a bond, a synergy with our backers, because ultimately you are the ones turning our dream into a reality.  We are excited to grow and anxious to see what the future has in store for us.
Who is the team and how did it all start?
Started by young entrepreneurs and watch enthusiasts Jake, and Kramer sought to cut out the brand inflation and retail markup of popular name brands. We have been obsessed with watches our entire life and got fed up paying for overpriced name brand watches. So now we're doing it ourselves. We started as friends, became roommates, and are now hoping to become business partners.

Now we're here, on IndieGogo, with a fully functional prototype that looks amazing. We just need one more thing... your support!

 


We Need Your Support!
In order to turn this dream of ours into a reality, we need your support. Not only does this mean pledging for one of our awesome watches, but sharing the story with a friend. The important thing to remember with IndieGogo is, if we don't reach our full funding goal....we get nothing. 
We are going to do everything we can to spread the word in a variety of ways.  We hope through the use of social media and blogs we can drive enough outside traffic to our page which will result in us reaching our funding goal.  If you could do something as simple as tweeting about our page, or just liking our Facebook page, it can really go a long way. Simply click the Facebook and Twitter tabs at the top ^ of the page, right below the video.
If funded, how will you fulfill the orders?
We've tweaked the initial prototype, finalized our design, purchased the molds and selected a manufacturer that has a great reputation in the industry.  Once Indiegogo releases the funds, we can pay the initial deposit to begin production.  Production time takes roughly 30 days depending on the quantity of the order.  Our team will then ship the orders to our awesome backers! We have experience with shipping software and thermal printers which should make for a very smooth process. 
(It is TIME for the MVMT)
From all of us here at MVMT, thanks for helping us kickstart this project.
 
Risks and challenges
The challenges of MVMT Watches will be getting the word out, and convincing IndieGogos to participate. With so many great projects to choose from, we hope ours will stand apart from the rest. To reach as many people as possible, we are asking friends, families, and various blogs to help spread the word.
Once the funding is in place, the challenge will be producing on a large scale. Depending on outside help is difficult, but we have been dealing with a manufacturer for months and have established a solid relationship, which has has given us a lot of confidence in them.",14.0,0,"3 Campaigns

Our mission is to sell and create appealing, one-of-a-kind <strong>CLOTHES</strong> that support and uplift a <strong>CAUSE</strong>, and ultimately make a <strong>CHANGE</strong> in our community and world<strong>. </strong>With your purchase on this site, you can help us open a store front in downtown Nashville and make the dream a <strong>reality</strong>.<br/> </p>
<p><strong>Clothes</strong>: We will offer an eclectic mix of merchandise for both home and wardrobe. We plan to sell one-of-a kind items sourced internationally, brand named designers, lesser-known brands, popular socially-conscious brands and own-brand labels aimed at an urban, hip, trendy shopper.</p>
<p>Our apparel is unique because it allows you to tell your story through your fashion. The approach is simple: Everyone has a story, so why not tell it with the year that it happened? Like the moment in 1995, the doctor looked up from the clear CT scan and said “You beat it.” Or the day in 2007 when you walked a stage and took hold of a diploma when no one said you could. You already wear this number on your heart as a marker, but now it’s time to wear it on your sleeve. With 1907 Apparel, you can design a shirt of your own with your specific year and provide hope to others with your story. (Check out the founder’s story below.)</p>
<p><strong><br/>Cause: </strong>Every purchase makes a difference because we invest 7% of our profits into causes that are important to us: <strong>eradicating poverty</strong>, <strong>providing education</strong> and <strong>supporting sustainable agriculture</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><br/>Change: </strong>Help us change the world. Whether it’s a shirt or accessory, your purchase will make a tangible impact on the globe: You could help feed a family in Uganda for two weeks, provide a forever family for an orphan in Detroit, build a school house in Burkina Faso, or help plant sustainable crops for nearby farms.<br/> </p>

<h3><strong><br/>Dawn’s Story</strong></h3>
<p><br/>While 1907 Apparel was established in 2012, the heart of our store was established 105 years ago, when my hope, my grandmother, was born on a sharecropper’s plantation in south Alabama. It would be 65 years until that hope became manifest in my life, when, with a full life that included grown children of her own, my grandmother walked into a hospital near downtown Nashville and saw two twin babies, abandoned by their parents, that stirred her heart. Compelled by love at 65 years old, she put them in her purse and carried them home. I was one of those babies.</p>
<p><br/>My grandmother, through that life-altering decision, birthed hope in me. For the next 19 years, she devoted every day of her life to raising my brother and me. She shepherded us, guarded us, provided for us, taught us, and, above all, loved us with a love we wouldn’t have found anywhere else. She showed us worth and value, and when she died in 1992, on the day before her 85th birthday, she had changed my life forever.</p>

<h3>WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT</h3>
<p>Hey everyone! We're Teryn+Dakota and we're bringing this campaign to IndieGogo because it's something that we're really passionate about. Unfortunately, we lack the resources to get the project going. This campaign is for a new awesome kids clothing company, featuring multiple shirt designs that are sure to make your little one the coolest on the block. This idea sprouted when I got pregnant with our first and we started accumulating clothes for him. Girls these days have no problem finding cute stuff to wear, but with boys it's another story. Everywhere we looked, there was clothing that didn't fit our taste and our choices were very limited! We decided to do something about it and create this line for parents who want to dress their kids with style and creativity! Our idea originally was based off of boys clothing, but we do have plans of expanding to more ""girly"" designs in the near future. Allow your littles to ""dress outside the box"" in our super awesome attire.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>PERKS</h3>
<p>To properly launch this line, we would like to start out with producing the 6 designs shown above for kids and on onesies for babies. This will give our customers some variety and allow us to have a good launch point. With time and after our first chunk of sales, we'll hopefully expand soon after to offer more diverse designs and styles.</p>
<p>By funding our campaign, you'll also sign yourself up for some great perks!</p>
<ul>
<li>Donate $50 and you become the designer! We'll make you your very own custom shirt design that's exclusive to you! *Limited to a 2 color design. We'll work with you until it's exactly what you want.</li>
<li>For every $20 that you donate toward our campaign, you will recieve credit for a free shirt of your choice once our shop is up and running. This is a great deal! You're basically just buying your item early. </li>
<li>Donate $10 and get free shipping on your first order!</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>IMPACT</h3>
<p>We strongly believe that it's important for kids to be able to express themselves. Without that, the world would be such a boring place! Let your child break the mold of ordinary fashions and really wear something that suits their giant personality! </p>
<p>By donating to our campaign and helping to make our dream a reality, we can bring you more and more product, diverse designs, better materials, and give back to the community in ways that wouldn't be possible without your help. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>HELP US OUT</h3>
<p>We understand that not everyone has the resources to donate to our campaign, but there are many other ways that you can help us. Please do whatever you can to draw attention to us and this project! Share this on Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest + Instagram! Tell everyone in your playdate groups, show other parents! Word of mouth will be the best way to get our message out and make our goals a reality! We really do appreciate this opportunity and look forward to what the future holds for this dream of ours.</p>

<h3>That's why we developed <strong>bandu, </strong>a watch that gives you time to slow down, take a moment, and prepare your best efforts.

<p> </p>
<h2><strong>How bandu works</strong></h2>
<p>bandu measures the autonomic nervous system, which is associated with the effects of stress including perspiration, respiration, and cardiology. The current version monitors your skin conductance, movement, and temperature. When you become stressed, bandu alerts to you to take a break. You can listen to a favorite song or play a fun game. You can even call a trusted friend, just stand up to stretch or even meditate. The results are shown right on your smartphone in real-time so you can monitor your stress level, see when it rises, and determine the people, places, and things that help you feel better. And over time, bandu automatically learns what works.</p>

<h2><strong>Our Story</strong></h2>

<h2><strong>The role of stress on life, work, and play</strong></h2>
<p>Stress is a survival instinct. When something feels like life or death - a big test, a major presentation, a costly game - that's how your body is feeling. And during those moments it's difficult to think straight. Stress affects your short-term memory, your long-term memory, and your attention. We know that stress can also become a medical problem and makes symptom worse for conditions as varied as post-traumatic stress, panic disorder, heart disease, asthma, irritible bowel syndrome, even fertility.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>My name is Leon Knight and I am 32 years old, married to my wife Tuesday for the last 13 years with two children Nathanael (12) and Kalah (9). I have been fishing bass tournaments while working full time as a Correctional officer for the last eleven years. I have been physically assaulted on several occasions, watched as close friends and fellow officers were brutally attacked, and have had my life threatened on more than one occasion.   Needless to say, bass fishing has been a positive outlet for me to handle the stresses of my job working in the prison. In 2010, I came to a cross road in my life. I had qualified to fish the 2011 FLW Tour which is comprised of 10 tournaments and only 150 of the best Bass Pro's in the world. It was as if my long time dream was staring me in the face. My wife and I felt the only way for us to keep our family intact and have a legitimite shot of being sucessfull on Tour was to stay together and move to a central location to enable me to spend as much time possible with my family and shorten the travel time from tournaments. So after a lot of prayer my wife and I agreed on leaving California and moving to Northern Alabama. With a first place prize of $125,000 and $10,000 paid to 50th place at every FLW Tour event the opportunity once again stares me in the face. I have already fished two events this year with eight to go. In my rookie year and with tough economic times sponsorships are scarce. I really believe if I can afford to fund the rest of my season, I will land the sponsorship I need to to continue on.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I stongly believe and know in my heart that my being able to travel around and meet new people has a strong impact on the people that God puts in my path.  I believe that everything happens for a reason.  One instance that comes clearly to my mind is the story of the two children I met while fishing a tournament at Lake Havasu in Arizona. During my tournament stay I met a brother and sister that were no younger than 10 years old.  It just amazed me at how hungry for attention these kids were.  Their parents didn't know where they were, who they, were with, and didn't even care.  The brother and sister hung out with me daily, helping me get my tackle ready, and just sitting around talking about life and fishing.  Since then I have been able to talk to them on the phone at the trailer park office, and have even sent them out packages with fishing poles, magazines, and lures.  The point that I am trying to make I guess is that, I know that God used me to speak encouragement to them and be an example to them by my actions.  There have been lots of other stories just like this, and it is because I have the opportunity to go to a lot of different places and meet many different people that God places in my path.  </p>
<p>If it turns out that my campaign does not happen, I will continue to the best of my ability to try and make my dreams come true.  I can only go as far as I have the money available to me.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The FLW Tour is comprised of 10 Tournaments with an entry fee of $4,000 per event totaling $40,000. I have already started my season and have paid my first two entry fees along with $1,000 deposits on the remaining eight events leaving a balance of 24,000 on the next eight events. All the money raised will go directly towards my entry fees which will be payable to FLW Outdoors (Tournament organazation flwoutdoors.com) At this point I due not have any additional funding. God willing whatever money I am lacking will be compesated with tournament winnings and I am working hard on obtaining a title sponsor to fund my endeavors. In my Tournament season I will be towing my boat throughout h United States traveling over 30,000 miles and visiting over twenty some states.  </p>

</div></div>","Our Story
My name is Leon Knight and I am 32 years old, married to my wife Tuesday for the last 13 years with two children Nathanael (12) and Kalah (9). I have been fishing bass tournaments while working full time as a Correctional officer for the last eleven years. I have been physically assaulted on several occasions, watched as close friends and fellow officers were brutally attacked, and have had my life threatened on more than one occasion.   Needless to say, bass fishing has been a positive outlet for me to handle the stresses of my job working in the prison. In 2010, I came to a cross road in my life. I had qualified to fish the 2011 FLW Tour which is comprised of 10 tournaments and only 150 of the best Bass Pro's in the world. It was as if my long time dream was staring me in the face. My wife and I felt the only way for us to keep our family intact and have a legitimite shot of being sucessfull on Tour was to stay together and move to a central location to enable me to spend as much time possible with my family and shorten the travel time from tournaments. So after a lot of prayer my wife and I agreed on leaving California and moving to Northern Alabama. With a first place prize of $125,000 and $10,000 paid to 50th place at every FLW Tour event the opportunity once again stares me in the face. I have already fished two events this year with eight to go. In my rookie year and with tough economic times sponsorships are scarce. I really believe if I can afford to fund the rest of my season, I will land the sponsorship I need to to continue on.  
 



The Impact
I stongly believe and know in my heart that my being able to travel around and meet new people has a strong impact on the people that God puts in my path.  I believe that everything happens for a reason.  One instance that comes clearly to my mind is the story of the two children I met while fishing a tournament at Lake Havasu in Arizona. During my tournament stay I met a brother and sister that were no younger than 10 years old.  It just amazed me at how hungry for attention these kids were.  Their parents didn't know where they were, who they, were with, and didn't even care.  The brother and sister hung out with me daily, helping me get my tackle ready, and just sitting around talking about life and fishing.  Since then I have been able to talk to them on the phone at the trailer park office, and have even sent them out packages with fishing poles, magazines, and lures.  The point that I am trying to make I guess is that, I know that God used me to speak encouragement to them and be an example to them by my actions.  There have been lots of other stories just like this, and it is because I have the opportunity to go to a lot of different places and meet many different people that God places in my path.  
If it turns out that my campaign does not happen, I will continue to the best of my ability to try and make my dreams come true.  I can only go as far as I have the money available to me.  
 



What We Need & What You Get
The FLW Tour is comprised of 10 Tournaments with an entry fee of $4,000 per event totaling $40,000. I have already started my season and have paid my first two entry fees along with $1,000 deposits on the remaining eight events leaving a balance of 24,000 on the next eight events. All the money raised will go directly towards my entry fees which will be payable to FLW Outdoors (Tournament organazation flwoutdoors.com) At this point I due not have any additional funding. God willing whatever money I am lacking will be compesated with tournament winnings and I am working hard on obtaining a title sponsor to fund my endeavors. In my Tournament season I will be towing my boat throughout h United States traveling over 30,000 miles and visiting over twenty some states.

They all reign far up high, at times showing off their pompously haughty and then again modestly simple presence.( upcoming solo exhibition 2015 *Museum für Abgüsse* Munich )                      When do I get my perk?
Some of the
perks are on stock – some have to be made especially for you.   But since we are
partly German, we are busy superbees - eager to please and not keep you
waiting. You should not have to wait longer than 3 - 6 weeks for your perk to
arrive. The collection is Made in Bavaria / Germany.   
Any more questions ? How do I become a friend and part of ook-fashion in Region USA, Europe or East?
Are you genuinely interested in becoming an active friend of ook-fashion ?
Excellent!

From the team that brought you Walksoftz, ""Roll-up ballerina flats in the clutch!"" - we are proud to introduce our new line - SOLZ shoes.  
 
At SOLZ, we have
designed and patented a new and unique shoe for a unique lifestyle – yours.  These
are shoes for walking around town all day or dancing all night.  They are

good - so will everyone else.


We have been working on this project for over a year and have already successfully brought our introductory ""Walksoftz"" shoes to market.  We now have the design for our new line finalized and manufacturing in place (not easy!).  It will cost approximately $15,000 to do the first production run.   I have self-funded this project so far and am now asking you to join me and help.  I have only about $5,000 left I can contribute because, unfortunately, you can't eat shoes.  So we are hoping to raise at least $10,000 here.  That is just a beginning, raising more will allow us to create new styles and colors and bring an amazing shoe to an even wider audience.

SOLZ shoes will all retail for $59.99, so pre-ordering them here for $33 is a fantastic deal!  You also have the opportunity to become an entrepreneur by joining us as a Founding Affiliate Partner and locking in the privilege of buying our shoes at an exclusive wholesale price going forward.  You even have the chance to truly let your SOLZ shine by joining us as a designer and collaborating on your own unique shoe.  Check out the perks.

SOLZ is also very proud to announce a new partnership with Nashville-based charity Soles4Souls.  Through this partnership SOLZ will be able to get a pair of shoes to someone in need for every single pair of SOLZ shoes ordered.  SOLZ will be sponsoring several shoe drives to collect used shoes as well as donating money for every new pair ordered.

** Just announced!  As a special token of our appreciation, for every contribution over $100 we will also include a free pair of our ""Walksoftz"" roll-up ballerina flats in the clutch! (retail $29.99)  Check them out here:  www.walkstreetmovement.com  

SOLZ is a parent company to three brands and we are creating three initial styles in conjunction with these brands.  You can choose the style you like best, or take advantage of  a great deal and choose all three!

Here are our initial styles:



The ones with the snake logo are called ""Sneakinz"" and available in men's full sizes 7-12 in both black and grey with matte synthetic.

The ones with the apple logo are called ""Walkstreetz"" and available in women's full sizes 4-10 in both black and grey with shinier patent synthetic. 

The ones with the sun logo are SOLZ flagship ultimate beach shoes and are unisex.  Mens sizes 7-12 and womens 4-10.  

All shoes are made additionally with ballistic nylon and a soft, environmentally friendly synthetic sole.  They can be bent, folded, and rolled up.  They are all machine washable.  And every pair comes with a matching ballistic nylon clip-on ""capsule"" bag and two SOLZ bracelets for additional packing options.  





A wise man once said, “Life is way too important to be taken too seriously.”  We agree.  Life should be fun, sunny, light and comfortable.  And so should your shoes.   Who says shoes have to be heavy, uncomfortable and boring?  Why cant your shoes fold up in a cool capsule or go in your back pocket when you want to change or be barefoot?  Why can’t you ""clip on"" an extra pair of shoes for that next trip without worrying if your bag is over the weight limit?  Why cant your shoes just be an extension of your feet … and your personality?  They can.

We truly appreciate your support and are here to answer any questions you may have.  brad@solzshoes.com.

Please add $5/pair for shipping and contact me for international shipping options.  

*** UPDATES:  I have been asked if it is possible to order two pairs at once.  Absolutely!  Just contribute $66 and add a note that you would like to pre-order two pairs.  Additionally, size and color selection is not a drop down selection, please add a note stating your preference or we will contact you at the time of order fulfillment.   If you are looking for sizes that are not listed please also send me an email, as we are still finalizing the order and will attempt to accommodate popular demand where possible.  :)",4.0,0,"6 Campaigns

With help from you and the Indiegogo community the funds raised from this campaign will go towards facilitating research and development in future innovative products just like Quik'Stix and bringing these products to stores near you! </p><div>
<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1462852631/Quik_Stix_small_vopbwo.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>Quik'Stix is a super sticky, multipurpose, two piece circular gel pad developed by Inov8 Labs that'll stick and secure just about anything you throw at it. Constructed specifically from a proprietary blend of injection moulded Poly AB Glue Plastic Quik'Stix provides greater stick, resistance, and durability than similar products in its class, can be cut, stretched and re-used by simply washing in warm water, and can be easily be repositioned when needed without loosing its super sticky properties. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1462852845/QuikStix_CoverNoLogo_eproyi.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>So where did the idea come from? The Quik'Stix idea was formed from analysing the multitude of options currently available on the market and understanding that they all lack a number of vital features needed to successfully become the go-to product for safely securing your household or everyday personal items. These included a secure reliable hold, a thoughtful design, and a proven recipe. Take Blue Tack as an example. Although it was designed to be used over and over again to temporarily fasten objects in fixed locations such as a wall or desk it generally lacks the ability to secure anything more than paper or small items such as pens. This provides a problem when you need to hold something heavier such as a remote, phone, or tablet. To solve this problem many people then lean towards another staple product. 3M backed Hooks or Velcro. Now although they do a great job at holding the extra weight they are either too bulky or lack the ability to be reused once placed. What happens if you want to move that picture frame you've just placed? or the iPad you would like in rotated? You get the idea!</p>
<p>Quik'Stix not only solves all these problems but also adds a bunch of extra features and this is where we need your help! We want Quik'Stix to be the go-to staple product for all your household and personal fastening needs and in order to do so are approaching you, our fellow Indiegogo backers, to help us bring our amazing product to market!</p>

For those after a more secure design we've added a removable green tape similar to that of 3M's ultra strong hold technology to one side of the circular design. This allows objects up to 600 grams to be safely and more permanently secured to most smooth surfaces all without causing any damage. However if you're after a less permanent solution, make a mistake, or simply change your mind this can still be easily removed.<br/><p></p>

Our super sticky yet easily removable custom recipe was designed by the graduate engineers at Inov8 Labs and while we cannot disclose the exact chemical compound it did involve reengineering a base recipe from the ground up to provide a superior hold as compared to similar products currently offered to market.<div>

<div>To add to the already appealing aesthetics we also chose the colour green for the secure hold technology as it proved to be the best option for locating the Quik'Stix on the majority of car dashes, walls, benches, etc. It also looks super cool!<br/>

Understanding that people may also want to use this product without it being so visible we kept the Poly AB Glue Polymer transparent as this allows the Quik’Stix to remain looking new and more attractive for longer plus reducing the visible signs of dust and debris. <br/>

<p>Removal of the Quik’Stix pads is simple. To correctly remove the Quik’Stix from the desired surface start by slowly lifting one edge of the sticky gel pad upwards and away from the surface. Using the released section as a tab continue by slowly peeling up the rest of the Quik’Stix as shown above.<br/></p>

<p>With usability in mind it was vital to make Quik'Stix 100% re-usable without losing its ever so sticky qualities. We designed a custom Poly AB Glue Plastic recipe that can be used over and over again by simply washing it under warm water. Just leave it to dry in room temperature for roughly 30 seconds and it's ready to be used like new!<br/></p>

Another important aspect in the design was the working temperature range of Quik’Stix. One of the many ways we like to use our Quik’Stix is to secure our phones to the car dash for use as a hands free gps device. However, the car dash can get very hot especially when driving or parked in the sun and thus it was important to create a product that could be used in across a broad range of temperatures. Our custom injection moulded Poly AB Glue Plastic recipe was specifically engineered to address this problem and can be used from -16 degrees celsius (0 F) all the way up to 62 degrees celsius (150 F).<br/>

<p>Disclaimer: Use Quik'Stix with common sense. Although Quik'Stix has been developed to hold objects up to 600g (1.322lb) it is NOT advisable to push the limits of the design. This means if the object is heavy, expensive, or precious more Quik'Stix pads should be used to safely secure the object to the desired surface. Another important factor affecting the overall strength capabilities of the design is the surface type you are trying to stick to.

</div></div>","QUIK'STIX NOW AVAILABLE!To purchase your Quik'Stix please select the required quantity indicated under each pledge tier on the right as well as the associated shipping amount. Orders will be sent out 1-2 business days of receiving your pledge. Recently Inov8Labs successfully raised enough funding on Kickstarter for the first batch raw materials, moulds and manufacturing, marketing, and distribution expenses necessary to successfully launch our product to market. However, after receiving an overwhelming amount of interest and amazing ideas from potential distributors and backers worldwide we, the Inov8Labs Team, would like to take things a step further. With help from you and the Indiegogo community the funds raised from this campaign will go towards facilitating research and development in future innovative products just like Quik'Stix and bringing these products to stores near you! 


Quik'Stix is a super sticky, multipurpose, two piece circular gel pad developed by Inov8 Labs that'll stick and secure just about anything you throw at it. Constructed specifically from a proprietary blend of injection moulded Poly AB Glue Plastic Quik'Stix provides greater stick, resistance, and durability than similar products in its class, can be cut, stretched and re-used by simply washing in warm water, and can be easily be repositioned when needed without loosing its super sticky properties. 


So where did the idea come from? The Quik'Stix idea was formed from analysing the multitude of options currently available on the market and understanding that they all lack a number of vital features needed to successfully become the go-to product for safely securing your household or everyday personal items. These included a secure reliable hold, a thoughtful design, and a proven recipe. Take Blue Tack as an example. Although it was designed to be used over and over again to temporarily fasten objects in fixed locations such as a wall or desk it generally lacks the ability to secure anything more than paper or small items such as pens. This provides a problem when you need to hold something heavier such as a remote, phone, or tablet. To solve this problem many people then lean towards another staple product. 3M backed Hooks or Velcro. Now although they do a great job at holding the extra weight they are either too bulky or lack the ability to be reused once placed. What happens if you want to move that picture frame you've just placed? or the iPad you would like in rotated? You get the idea!
Quik'Stix not only solves all these problems but also adds a bunch of extra features and this is where we need your help! We want Quik'Stix to be the go-to staple product for all your household and personal fastening needs and in order to do so are approaching you, our fellow Indiegogo backers, to help us bring our amazing product to market!

It's trademark Green colour is not just for looks! For those after a more secure design we've added a removable green tape similar to that of 3M's ultra strong hold technology to one side of the circular design. This allows objects up to 600 grams to be safely and more permanently secured to most smooth surfaces all without causing any damage. However if you're after a less permanent solution, make a mistake, or simply change your mind this can still be easily removed.





Each Quik'Stix is made up of a centre circle and outer ring measuring 35mm (1.378in) and 55mm (1.97in) in diameter and has been engineered to safely hold objects up to 600g (1.322lb) which is more than enough for most small household or personal items. Our super sticky yet easily removable custom recipe was designed by the graduate engineers at Inov8 Labs and while we cannot disclose the exact chemical compound it did involve reengineering a base recipe from the ground up to provide a superior hold as compared to similar products currently offered to market.


To add to the already appealing aesthetics we also chose the colour green for the secure hold technology as it proved to be the best option for locating the Quik'Stix on the majority of car dashes, walls, benches, etc. It also looks super cool!





Understanding that people may also want to use this product without it being so visible we kept the Poly AB Glue Polymer transparent as this allows the Quik’Stix to remain looking new and more attractive for longer plus reducing the visible signs of dust and debris. 




 
Removal of the Quik’Stix pads is simple. To correctly remove the Quik’Stix from the desired surface start by slowly lifting one edge of the sticky gel pad upwards and away from the surface. Using the released section as a tab continue by slowly peeling up the rest of the Quik’Stix as shown above.


Removal of your possessions is even easier. Simply grip the item firmly and rotate either clockwise or anti-clockwise.



With usability in mind it was vital to make Quik'Stix 100% re-usable without losing its ever so sticky qualities. We designed a custom Poly AB Glue Plastic recipe that can be used over and over again by simply washing it under warm water. Just leave it to dry in room temperature for roughly 30 seconds and it's ready to be used like new!





Another important aspect in the design was the working temperature range of Quik’Stix. One of the many ways we like to use our Quik’Stix is to secure our phones to the car dash for use as a hands free gps device. However, the car dash can get very hot especially when driving or parked in the sun and thus it was important to create a product that could be used in across a broad range of temperatures. Our custom injection moulded Poly AB Glue Plastic recipe was specifically engineered to address this problem and can be used from -16 degrees celsius (0 F) all the way up to 62 degrees celsius (150 F).























This is where we need you! Although we've successfully raised our original funding goal on Kickstarter the money raised from our Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign will go to facilitating further research and development and future innovative products just like Quik'Stix.

Disclaimer: Use Quik'Stix with common sense. Although Quik'Stix has been developed to hold objects up to 600g (1.322lb) it is NOT advisable to push the limits of the design. This means if the object is heavy, expensive, or precious more Quik'Stix pads should be used to safely secure the object to the desired surface. Another important factor affecting the overall strength capabilities of the design is the surface type you are trying to stick to. Generally the bumpier/rougher the surface the less likely Quik'Stix can guarantee a secure hold. The same applies for the surface of the object you are securing. Quik'Stix, Inov8 Labs and any related persons or groups are not liable in anyway for any damage to your belongings, surfaces or self when using Quik'Stix gel pads so please use with caution.
Returns: Should you receive your Quik'Stix pad in less than perfect condition, you may contact us for a free replacement.

<h2>Spitfire Aviators Sunglasses with Side-Shields</h2>
<p>Circa 1940s: The Spitfire fighter — flawlessly designed and nimble in the air — pierced the skies of Great Britain.</p>
<p>O’Riginal’s Trading Co. is thrilled to bring you the Spitfire Aviator sunglasses. These are true aviator sunglasses with stainless steel wire frame construction and wire-mesh side-shields that don’t interfere with peripheral vision. Spitfires are great in the car, on the mountain, at the beach or just walking around town. They’ll keep you looking cool as you head into the dog fights of daily life.</p>

<li>You can see reviews from customers via a third party on my website I have a 92% rating from Shopper Approved. You can see those <a href=""https://originalstradingco.com/reviews/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</li>
<li>I also have over 40K fans on the O'Riginals Trading Co. <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/ORiginalsTradingCo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">FB page</a>.</li>
<li>You have backed me in the past and know the pride and care I put into each line of glasses.</li>

<h3>The Perks</h3>
<p><strong>Early Bird</strong> - Choose any color of Spitfire at a reduced backing level and limited quantity.  One per backer</p>
<p><strong>The Ace - </strong>You get one pair of Spitfires in the color of your choice.</p>

<h3>Where Does The Backing Go?</h3>
<p>Once fees are paid and funds are dispersed to O'Riginal's Trading Co.  the order with the factory will be placed and confirmed.  I usually place a 40% deposit and pay the balance at time of shipping.  I also hold funds until I approve the production sample.</p>
<p>After a successful crowdfund I plan to place the order at or around December 18th, if funds have been released by Indiegogo.  I hope to be shipping the Spitfires by April 20th of 2020.</p>

<h3>It's All About You</h3>
<p>I first started refurbishing antique glasses in 2011 before I started the crowdfund  odyssey that brought my O'Riginals Sterling 23 to the market in 2015.  That is when the glasses became about you, the backer and customer.  I realized then I am not the only one who loves this type of eyewear.  That's when O'Riginals Trading Company became a team with those who have supported me on this journey. </p>
<p>I now have friends from Delhi to Denver and Sydney to Salzburg.  O'Riginal's glasses with side-shields have been to the South Pole and the summit of Mt. Everest.  They even protected a customer from losing their eye to a saw blade in their metal shop.</p>
<p>I am so fortunate to continue onto the next glasses line and thankful to have you with me for the ride.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>To be honest I don't see much risk, I am not new to crowdfunding my glasses and have fulfilled all backers in the past. I am fully confident that every backer will get their glasses.</p>
<p>The Challenge is getting them in the time frame that I project.  My three projects have all run later than expected.  I have run into production issues that added time to the back end.  I believe I am building enough time into the schedule to get an 'on time' shipping schedule.</p>
<p>Here are two examples of issues that added time into the final shipping on one occasion the side-shields were not done correctly and I had to send 1,000 pair back to the factory .  Another time the factory used the wrong rivets. I had to replace 8,000 rivets on 2,000 pairs of glasses myself prior to shipment.</p>
<p>Shipping can be a challenge.  When you are shipping world-wide it can take some time to get to Johannesburg.</p>
<p>Issues arise. It is the nature of crowdfunding, but a good producer will fix the problems that come up.  Crowdfunding isn't like buying fro Amazon, it is a process and you are along for the ride, good, bad and ugly.  </p>
<p>Bottom line, producing products is difficult and not for the faint of heart.  I have three successful public crowdfunds behind me. Here's to another one.</p>

I first started refurbishing antique glasses in 2011 before I started the crowdfund  odyssey that brought my O'Riginals Sterling 23 to the market in 2015.  That is when the glasses became about you, the backer and customer.  I realized then I am not the only one who loves this type of eyewear.  That's when O'Riginals Trading Company became a team with those who have supported me on this journey. 
I now have friends from Delhi to Denver and Sydney to Salzburg.  O'Riginal's glasses with side-shields have been to the South Pole and the summit of Mt. Everest.  They even protected a customer from losing their eye to a saw blade in their metal shop.
I am so fortunate to continue onto the next glasses line and thankful to have you with me for the ride.

Risks & Challenges
To be honest I don't see much risk, I am not new to crowdfunding my glasses and have fulfilled all backers in the past. I am fully confident that every backer will get their glasses.
The Challenge is getting them in the time frame that I project.  My three projects have all run later than expected.  I have run into production issues that added time to the back end.  I believe I am building enough time into the schedule to get an 'on time' shipping schedule.
Here are two examples of issues that added time into the final shipping on one occasion the side-shields were not done correctly and I had to send 1,000 pair back to the factory .  Another time the factory used the wrong rivets. I had to replace 8,000 rivets on 2,000 pairs of glasses myself prior to shipment.
Shipping can be a challenge.  When you are shipping world-wide it can take some time to get to Johannesburg.
Issues arise. It is the nature of crowdfunding, but a good producer will fix the problems that come up.  Crowdfunding isn't like buying fro Amazon, it is a process and you are along for the ride, good, bad and ugly.  
Bottom line, producing products is difficult and not for the faint of heart.  I have three successful public crowdfunds behind me. Here's to another one.


If You Can't Back The Spitfire
Thank's for taking the time to have a good look at the Spitfire Aviators from O'Riginals.  I appreciate that they may not be for everyone and you aren't going to back the project.  However, I bet you know someone or there is somebody in your social media reach that would love to have a look at the Spitfires.
Please take a minute an share this out on the huge and vast interwebs.  You know Facebook, Instagram, Twitter...whatever else you are using.",24.0,0,"3 Campaigns

Our Classic Cap-Toe OxfordFounders: What Makes Us Who We Are


Materials. Top-quality luxury French calfskin, double-thick genuine leather soles, stacked leather heels, and glove-lined interiors. The leather is as bullet-proof and beautiful as it comes - it will develop a beautiful patina over time and withstand the stress of years of wear and multiple resolings.

Make. World-class production in a multi-generational, family-owned luxury factory in Naples, Italy using Rapid Stitch Construction - full leather insole, full leather midsole, full leather outsole. It is the benchmark standard of quality shoe production. If you have never experienced shoes produced in the craftsman tradition - the attention to detail combined with unparalleled durability is the definition of 'less is more' mentality - it's simply how it should be done.

Value. We are offering our first release direct-to-consumer in order to provide an unheard of value in the luxury shoe market. Shoes produced to similar quality standards and with similar luxury materials retail for 3-4x what we are offering here on Indiegogo. This is a top-quality product that will be on your feet for years.

Beauty. With your help, it is our goal not only to provide these essentials - everyone needs a lace-up, a loafer, and a beautiful boot - but to build a brand focused on producing top-quality, patently beautiful product that tells our story. We want to establish Founders as the answer to the uncertainty and anxiety we all experience trying to find quality at a fair price - a brand that you can have confidence in time and again.

Care. Each pair of Founders shoes comes with a pair of double barrel, high vamp, genuine cedar shoe trees and luxury shoe bags. In contrast to today's world of fast-fashion, Founders is offering a decade product - with proper care, a pair of Founders will be part of your life for years to come. Shoe trees are the most important part of that care regime - they maintain the shoe's shape, fight unnecessary creasing, alleviate odor, help the shoe dry properly - and honestly just look so cool.

Models



It is our goal in designing Founder's initial product offerings to focus on the three shoes that everyone should have in their closet. If you are going to own only three shoes, we think these should be the three.

<p>By using crowdfunding as a way for supporters to pre-pay for designs, we reduce the financial risk of designing a line.

Once a design is purchased at least ten times, we manufacture and produce for them.</p>
<p>Thanks to tiered manufacturing, the more a design sells, the less the cost of production, which means more profit for the designer and a lower cost for the consumer. </p>

<p></p></div>","About
Us
Gamblers Gear was founded on
the idea that every player is part of a community. We are all familiar with
the kinship towards Poker, however there are many other popular games at the
casinos. We at Gamblers Gear feel that no one is properly creating a brand to
service this entire community.
A casino
outing is fun on many levels. The excitement we experience with friends as we
compete to win cash, the memories from a weekend getaway and the new
individuals we meet while sitting at the tables. We see no reason why these
entertaining trips can’t be captured in a T-shirt that allows you to
enjoy the moment with your friends, act as a reminder from the memories or
perhaps a way to meet new people.
We believe that
the image of this community is more than just that of a King or Ace card. They have a unique attitude and speak their
own language. For example, Black Jack players know when it is best to
Double Down their bets while Baccarat players are known to yell Monkey in the
hopes of a face card. We have tried to capture some of these popular sayings
into humorous designs that are still fashionable. 
A few
examples of some of the insider gaming language we have incorporated into our
designs can be seen in the following:
Double Down: This term is typically used during Blackjack when a
player is dealt an 11 and doubles their bet in hopes of a 21. We have
incorporated an 8 and a 3 into our design as a way to illustrate this.



King Monkey and Monkey (x3): Monkey is used by both Blackjack and
Baccarat players in the hopes of being dealt a face card. Our Monkey (x3)
design plays on the fun that Baccarat players typically yell this word three
times for luck.




When the Fun Stops: This is a reference to the tag line for Gamblers
Anonymous as a reminder that gambling is meant to be fun and enjoyable.


We have
several initial designs for both men and woman, which can be seen by visiting
our website at www.gamblersgear.com.
Our shirts, which are a fitted cut, will be made with a tri-blend fabric
(cotton/polyester/rayon) that feels comfortable in any environment.
Our
vision for Gamblers Gear is to build a brand. We are starting with these initial
T-shirt designs, however our goal is to add newer designs and eventually other
apparel categories. Furthermore, with online gaming becoming legalized and the
potential for exponential on-line traffic, we feel the timing is right for our
concept. However, before we take our first step, we need your help today to get started.

What We
Need & What You Get
We are asking for your help to raise
$3,500. These funds will primarily be directed to start our screen-printing
for each of our SKUs (8 designs for men and 7 for women). In addition to
building an inventory, these funds will provide us with a boost to our PR budget
to properly build the Gamblers Gear brand.
As a reward for your support, we would like to offer the following

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>My name is Peter McConnell, and I have created The Ogre. I live on the Gold Coast in Queensland, Australia, and my normal vocation is teaching corporate wellness.</p>
<p>I stumbled across my idea while thinking about how to carry a Stand-up Paddle Board to the beach, and this creation came to me. I could not find the design anywhere so I set about making some prototypes.</p>
<p>So, here I am, at that critical stage of needing to increase the size of the project.</p>
<p>The Ogre gets its name from being Ergo backwards, given it's an ergonomic strap, and I like the idea of an Ogre helping you carry your bags!</p>
<p>I have always seen this product as very simple and highly versatile across many industries. The Ogre protects your posture, reduces shoulder load, and frees up your hand instead of always needing to adjust the strap hanging off your shoulder.</p>
<p>The Ogre, with it's various attachments, will assist in carrying:</p>
<ul>
<li>Surfboard bags</li>
<li>Media equipment</li>
<li>Travel bags</li>
<li>Sports bags</li>
<li>Construction equipment</li>
<li>Laptop bags</li>
<li>Golf bags, and many more.</li>
</ul>
<p>With my passion for helping companies and individuals become healthier in every aspect of their lives, this product, The Ogre, is very special to me because I know I can help out a multitude of people who need to carry heavy loads for whatever reason. On a daily basis I see everyone from school children to golfers to cameramen struggling with the weight and load distribution of the bags they are hauling.</p>
<p><strong>Current stage:</strong></p>
<p>Presently, I am in the Patent Pending stage, and I have manufacturing and shipping organised and priced. I am using a local business with 15 years experience in organising the manufacture and shipping of goods to Australia. The next big step is cementing distribution channels in the various industries, and creating a strong online presence.</p>
<p>Thank you for your interest in helping The Ogre help others carry their load!</p>
<p><strong>Testimonial:</strong></p>
<p>“I believe the many advantages of this strap are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reducing the load on the shoulder and collarbone</li>
<li>Easing discomfort in the neck and shoulders</li>
<li>The horizontal strap disperses the load through the spine, improving posture and efficiency</li>
<li>The horizontal strap draws the shoulder load back toward the centre of the body</li>
<li>The load is maintained close to the body</li>
<li>Freeing the use of the hands.”</li>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><strong>My wish is to create The Ogre on a grand scale, reaching industries and countries everywhere. My request for $75,000 is to pay for:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Further patenting work - this includes completing the Australian Patent process and International Patent application. After these steps ultimately I will also be selecting what countries to apply for Patents. The cost of this whole process can be upwards of $50,000.</li>
<li>Marketing &amp; Distribution planning. Currently The Ogre wil be sold through various channels - online direct sales; wholesale to online sites; wholesale to relevant industry companies; and via relevant industry distributors.</li>
<li>Further design including different sizes, colours, and bag attachments. I have already organised manufacturing in Asia, and because they have minimum order requirements (1000 units), I will need to order a few thousand straps to cover the different sizes and attachments. Curently the colour is black,  however at the right time I will need to have several colour choices available. The prototype strap is a large size which will fit anyone up to about 120kg. It can be used on much smaller people (I am 85kg and it's adjusted to its mid-range.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For your kindness and generosity, I will be offering:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Ogre in its prototype form which are immediately available (only 50 exist!!)</li>
<li>The Ogre in its newer state which will be available later in the year</li>
<li>The Ogre with extra attachments so you can use it for carrying a bare board..</li>
<li>The Ogre in bulk amounts of varying sizes at wholesale prices</li>
<li>And I like The Ogre logo so much I will be offering T-shirts to give more choices in price scale.</li>
</ul>
<p>If I do not reach my entire funding goal, the funds will go to the patenting process first, and then into marketing and promotion costs. Ultimately every dollar I receive pushes me far closer to my goals with The Ogre.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Developing The Ogre has been an amazing journey for me to this point. I have met some very helpful people and been well-guided. I see The Ogre as a wonderful tool to help people in many different industries with the carrying of their respective loads. As I teach corporate wellness and postural correction, The Ogre is another method by which I can assist people all over the world to carry heavy things more easily and more safely.</p>
<p>What started out as a curiosity in carrying a stand-up paddle board has morphed into a terrific project in helping people from all walks of life. I have much work to do in making this a success for everyone involved now and in the future, and with your help I can make this happen.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and your contributions. I am truly grateful for your assistance and excited at what will be achieved!</p>

I come from a creative family and find that as I am getting older my genes are taking over and I am becoming totally drawn into creative work. To expand the business I am now also developing number of consumer lifestyle products with designs inspired by British wildlife and nature.I have always found happiness, peace, comfort and harmony in nature. My wish is to bring these positive elements into people's lives by way of bringing products with nature related patterns to market.I would now like to take this project forward and make it successful, creating not only beautiful designs but also opportunities for young people qualified in art/design who are new entrants into the job market, as I think things are still tough for new graduates. I need funding of $37,000 to launch this new brand.

<p>My name is Zach Stuck and I am a 20-year-old college marketing student and the sole founder of Pif Clothing Co., which I launched on January 16th of 2013. To say the least, the last couple of months have been crazy. Between releasing my first products, creating a universal donating process, developing a sustainable business, and learning as much as I can everyday about the clothing industry, all while fulfilling my brand’s mission, I’ve kept myself pretty busy. As of today, Pif Clothing Co. has sold around 200 total items and donated the same within our first 5 months in business. </p>
<p><strong>About Pif Clothing Co...</strong></p>
<p>1. 100% Made in America Clothing – Manufactured in America garments, custom logo tags made in Florida, high quality screen-printed in Wisconsin, sewing done local. (Benefits national, state, and local economies).</p>
<p>2. For each item sold, Pif Clothing Co. donates the same quality/same design product to children who can truly benefit from it. All donating up to this point has been through multiple Boys &amp; Girls Clubs in Wisconsin. Pif donates on somewhat of a quarterly basis (February/March, May/June, August/September, November/December).</p>
<p>3. At first glance, the price point may seem slightly high. Most clothing brands are charging the same (if not more) for their clothing, giving them loads of profit. Pif Clothing Co.’s approach is different. That profit is used to purchase another of the same quality shirt to give to a child.</p>
<p>... Join the movement to Pay It Forward and to support American made products by ordering from Pif Clothing Co. today.</p>
<p><strong>Now to our summer line products…</strong></p>
<p>One of each summer line product is fully created. In order to produce these products at a cost that supports our price point while still gaining profits, Pif Clothing Co. would need $30,000 in sales (about 600 t-shirts/tanktops and 100 sweatshirts). I greatly appreciate your support on any level. In turn, I am eager to supply you with a high quality Made in America product, equipped with high quality screen-printed graphics, and custom logo tags and tag-less tags. Above all, that same quality item will be given to a child that can benefit from it. Your support gives you and Pif Clothing Co. the opportunity to benefit many!</p>
<p>Thanks for all of your support. – Zach</p>

<h1>High quality American Made clothing.</h1>
<p>You bet! Pif Clothing Co. plans to provide only American Made Clothing. All of Pif Clothing Co. summer line products will be printed on American Apparel Garments. T-shirts are a 50/50 cotton/polyester blend, which creates a comfortable and slim fitting t-shirt. Tanktops are tri-blend (50%Polyester/25%Cotton/25%Rayon), making a soft and light tank top perfect for hot summer days. Pif Clothing Co. sweatshirts are 100% Cotton, comfy, warm, and great year round.</p>

<h1>Will buying from Pif Clothing Co. create American jobs? </h1>
<p> Why, of course! Pif Clothing Co. is already generating business for many companies (Screen Print Shop, Tag Company, Clothing Manufacturer, Local Sewing Business). The more products that Pif Clothing Co. sells, the more help is needed, bringing even more work to these local businesses, creating even more jobs for them. The brand is always growing, creating an even bigger need for employees within as well.</p>
<h1>How does the donating process work? </h1>
<p> Thanks for asking! Pif Clothing Co. donates on somewhat of a quarterly basis (February/March, May/June, August/September, November/December). When the time comes, I contact the Boys and Girls Clubs that desire to receive clothing from Pif Clothing Co. and supply them with an item of each size. These will be used to figure out how many of each size product they would need. We then ship each Club as many garments as we can to best fill their requests.</p>
<h1>How can a clothing business like Pif Clothing Co. be sustainable when it has such a low profit margin?</h1>
<p>Great question! It all comes down to the ordering process. Pif Clothing Co. plans to continue selling products in a similar fashion as that of Indiegogo. Pre-orders will be held for all of our clothing and future products from now on out. Each time an item is introduced, there will be a time limit set (for example: 1 week) to order the product. A minimum number of orders will be set for each product as well. If the minimum number of orders is not met within the set time limit, the products will not be manufactured or sold, and the customers will be refunded their money. This process is set up to prevent the suffering from dead inventory and will guarantee a profit margin. Pif Clothing Co. will sell direct to consumers through our own website (<a href=""http://www.pifclothing.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.pifclothing.com</a>). This will avoid the 100% mark-ups most stores add to products.</p>
<h1>Why donate to Boys and Girls Clubs?</h1>
<p>I thought you’d never ask. Pif Clothing Co. runs on a mission that I strive to fulfill, which is introducing another aspect to the business that reaches out to the community. We’re not just handing out free t-shirts, but providing clothing that will give a wide range of children confidence and comfort through a stylish, high quality garment. Boys and Girls Club is introduced daily to new children, many of whom come from low-income homes. Not all of these families are able to purchase high quality and trendy clothing on their own. Donating t-shirts won’t change the world, but I believe giving children confidence through quality clothing is a good place to start.</p>
