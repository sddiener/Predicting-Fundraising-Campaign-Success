<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>This film will dive into the story of the Puerto Rican people, who are currently recovering from Hurricane Maria. We’ll be following the story through Chef Ventura Vivoni, of Adjuntas, Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>Like much of the island, his restaurant, Hacienda Luz de Luna, was decimated during Hurricane Maria. Chef Vivoni decided to stay on the island after the storm and began cooking meals for all who needed it. With the help of World Central Kitchen, he’s impacted more than 200 communities and served over 80,000 hot meals in Puerto Rico for those who still don’t have power. On top of feeding the hungry, Chef Vivoni has also been teaching communities about agricultural independence &amp; sustainability. We’ll be following the story through Chef Vivoni's eyes, learning about his personal history, what he experienced during the storm, and what he’s doing now on the island for his people. While telling Chef Vivoni’s story, we’ll provide context and background information on these main topics: Puerto Rican Culture, Puerto Rican History, and the weather and infrastructure of Puerto Rico.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Making a documentary is not only hard work, but a lot of money</p>
<ul>
<li>We're planning on traveling down to Puerto Rico and shooting with a small team. We'll need funding for the equipment rentals, crew, and lodging. Plus insurance, that's pretty important too.</li>
<li>In addition, we have a lot to film in the states in terms of interviews with historians, cultural experts and government officials. We'll be renting the same gear and using the same team to make it all possible.</li>
<li>When everything is shot, we'll need hard drives for the project, as well as paying our editor, illustration/animation team, composer, and any music rights we may need.</li>

</div></div>","About ci2i
 
THERE'S ALWAYS SOME ROOM
FOR IMPROVISATION
 
ci2i is a film that captures the essence and ephemeral beauty of Contact Improvisation: intimate, playful, raw, unfiltered, often wild, Contact Improvisation – or C.I. for short – is a dance form that requires connection, presence and a willingness to take risks.

 
The Contributors
 
THERE IS NO SUCH THING
AS SOLO DANCING
 
ci2i was shot by professional dance film maker Dan Farberoff at the 2016 Freiburg International Contact Festival, one of the world's foremost festivals, and is accompanied by beautiful music from improvisation virtuoso David Leahy.
 

Film Maker, Dan FarberoffWebsite

Musician, David LeahyWebsite
 

To make it this far, the film maker, composer and festival organisers and participant have given freely of their time, skills and resources. The many hours of footage have been sifted through and made ready to cut.
All that is needed now is your support.
 

 
What Do Backers Get?
 
IMPROVISATION IS TOO GOOD
TO LEAVE TO CHANCE
 
The funds raised will help cover some of the costs involved in completing the film: editing, colour-grading, sound-design, graphics, as well as music-licensing and additional expenses.
In addition to the completed film, backers receive a whole video-album with a dozen additional short films, composed of bonus material from the many hours of footage shot at Freiburg, and accompanied by a full collection of beautiful musical compositions from David Leahy.
Also on offer are signed, high quality, large scale, limited edition photographic prints of ci2i original artwork, and a chance to win 2 days pro bono of the film maker's time to help you in creating your own video project, and also an opportunity to become a project Sponsor.
 
Paypal & Credit Card Payments
Indiegogo collects payments via PayPal. When making a contribution you can choose to either sign in to a PayPal account or, in some countries, elect to ""Pay as a Guest"" and use a credit card without having a PayPal account. However, PayPal has restricted the use of guest checkout for some international customers.
If you wish to support the project and are experiencing issues making payment via Paypal please don't despair! Send me a message and I will reply with alternative payment options.

<h3>The Story of <i>""Let Go""</i>
</h3>
<p><i>Let Go</i>, inspired by true events, tells the story of Katie-- a small town introvert with aspirations to be a writer in the big city. While working towards her writing, Katie has a not-so-quiet evening when her old high school, party best friend Briana comes back into Katie's life. Will it be the reunion Katie will remember or want to forget? Has too much time apart to a strain on their friendship or made them even stronger and closer?</p>
<h3>Why This Story Is Important.</h3>
<p>It may be a passion project if anything, but it really explores the idea of strained relationships or falling outs with those once close to us. It's something we believe everyone has experienced and can relate to, with change being inevitable and how people don't always stay the same. It also reflects that moment of realization where someone may realize their friend isn't who they thought they were, they used them or any other red flags they may see years later in the relationship. It's a topic no one likes to think about or go through, but life isn't easy and is always teaching us important lessons. And understanding which friends to keep and those you have to let go of is one of them.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; How You Can Help</h3>
<p>Though we have story, it takes more than that to make it come to life onscreen. Many things will be needed to make the film happen like:</p>

<h2>Who Am I?</h2>
<p>Hi, my name is Victoria, the director of Passbrook, and I am a Senior Digital Cinema Major at John Brown University.  I grew up in Tulsa, Oklahoma, as a theatre enthusiast, acting in stage productions, but it wasn't until high school that I dipped my toes into the realm of filmmaking.  I attended the 2013 Austin Film Festival for the first time, and it was there the decision was made to start a career as a filmmaker.  Since then, I've worked on feature independent films, short films, and music videos.  Several of the films I have had the opportunity to work on have made it into film festivals around the country.</p>
<h2>What Am I Doing?</h2>
<p>My Senior Thesis Film, Passbrook, is about a young burnt out musician who is struggling to find direction and meaning in his life.  Everything changes, however, when he totals his car and becomes stuck in the odd small town of Passbrook, unaware that the atypical folks he encounters will be the ones to help him change the course of his life.</p>
<p>Passbrook could be best described as a quirky narrative drama that relies heavily on visual stylization.  My intent is to not merely capture the action and dialogue in a way that is coherent and properly assembled, but in a way so every building block or aspect of the film is intentionally motivated to tell the story in the best and truest way possible.  We have put together an incredibly talented cast and crew who have already invested a great deal of time and effort towards this movie.  Shooting will begin now and wrap at the end of March.  It will be ready for an official screening on April 30th, 2017!</p>
<h2>What Do We Need?</h2>
<p>In order to take this story from paper to reality, we need funding to cover these specific areas:</p>
<p><strong>Budget Breakdown:</strong></p>
<p><strong>35%</strong> is allotted to our <strong>Art Department</strong> for wardrobe, set decoration, props, and special effects.</p>
<p><strong>25%</strong> is allotted towards <strong>Craft Services</strong> for feeding the cast and crew on all shooting days.</p>
<p><strong>15%</strong> will finance<strong> film festival</strong> application fees in order to submit our film nationwide.</p>
<p><strong>10%</strong> is allotted to<strong> Grip &amp; Electric</strong> for light bulbs, tape, blackwrap, batteries, etc.</p>

<p>Storytelling is a powerful and influential tool, because it allows us to access the inner core of our human emotions.  If done correctly, the transparency of the characters' thoughts and feelings allow the audience to relate to and understand people in our society that are different or similar to ourselves.  The reason I want to make this film in particular, is because I believe this story can take people away, even if for a short amount of time, from the chaos and hardships that consume their every day lives.  And in return, bring them into a place where they can freely step into the shoes of fascinating and relatable people.  The everyday struggles and obstacles encountered by the characters in this film are what I believe to be issues that many of us face in real life, and oftentimes have trouble coming to terms with.  My hope is that by the end of the film, whoever is watching will feel and see differently than they did before the movie began.</p>

</div></div>","Who Am I?
Hi, my name is Victoria, the director of Passbrook, and I am a Senior Digital Cinema Major at John Brown University.  I grew up in Tulsa, Oklahoma, as a theatre enthusiast, acting in stage productions, but it wasn't until high school that I dipped my toes into the realm of filmmaking.  I attended the 2013 Austin Film Festival for the first time, and it was there the decision was made to start a career as a filmmaker.  Since then, I've worked on feature independent films, short films, and music videos.  Several of the films I have had the opportunity to work on have made it into film festivals around the country.
What Am I Doing?
My Senior Thesis Film, Passbrook, is about a young burnt out musician who is struggling to find direction and meaning in his life.  Everything changes, however, when he totals his car and becomes stuck in the odd small town of Passbrook, unaware that the atypical folks he encounters will be the ones to help him change the course of his life.
Passbrook could be best described as a quirky narrative drama that relies heavily on visual stylization.  My intent is to not merely capture the action and dialogue in a way that is coherent and properly assembled, but in a way so every building block or aspect of the film is intentionally motivated to tell the story in the best and truest way possible.  We have put together an incredibly talented cast and crew who have already invested a great deal of time and effort towards this movie.  Shooting will begin now and wrap at the end of March.  It will be ready for an official screening on April 30th, 2017!
What Do We Need?
In order to take this story from paper to reality, we need funding to cover these specific areas:
Budget Breakdown:
35% is allotted to our Art Department for wardrobe, set decoration, props, and special effects.
25% is allotted towards Craft Services for feeding the cast and crew on all shooting days.
15% will finance film festival application fees in order to submit our film nationwide.
10% is allotted to Grip & Electric for light bulbs, tape, blackwrap, batteries, etc.
10% is set aside for contingency. 
5% will cover the cost of transportation.
As a team of artists who are hungry to create, we would very much appreciate any form of contribution.  As college students, money is particularly hard to come by, and so we humbly ask for your support!  In appreciation of your generosity, our crew would like to assemble our skills as masters of a variety of crafts and provide you with special gifts and perks!

<p>Raising the dead for dummies is a Horror comedy in where after a night of partying, four friends end up stealing the book of the dead from a voodoo priest. After reading from the book Jimmy (our main character) becomes cursed and slowly begins to transform into a demon that will bring hell to earth. Now armed with demonic powers, Jimmy and his friends have to find a way to reverse the spell before the demon is fully able to take over, all while being pursued by Mr. Ke'yama Voodoo priest they stole from, who wants the book for his own sinister reasons.</p>

<p>My name is Liam Petite from Halifax, Nova Scotia. In 2012, I started my first film, a mockumentary telling a fictional tale of a factual band ""Spirit of the Wildfire"". Growing up in the same hometown, we have similar inspirations of expressing our environment through our art. What started as a class assignment in the midst of my two years in film school turned into a wild and ""hooliganistic"" adventure. When starting this project, the then four member group was in a similar stage of their career as I was. We were just getting started on bringing our passions to reality. The project immediately ignited into something much more than what we expected. Since the making of this film, their talent in music and my knowledge in film has skyrocketed resulting in us being even more equipped to produce a high quality collaboration. With a heavy resume on my end and a recently released album with another on the way from them, we think it is perfect time to create a sequel showcasing the progression in both careers and continue the story of 'Caught in the Wildfire'.</p>
<p>One of our biggest struggles during our original production was producing a film while also being starving students. Not that any of us are pulling in anything close to big bucks now, but the first film was entirely made from nothing but creativity of the 5 involved parties. Though we will continue to be resourceful, we are seeking means to be able to let us take a step further in our production value by increase our capacity to book locations and rent necessary equipment. If our goal of $2000 is reached, we will be able to have the freedom to bring more production value to this project and step outside of amateur film making into a film festival worthy production.</p>
<p>Any money that is funded will go entirely towards this project. We are going to keep our followers up to date on where the money is going on our facebook page, from however much we start with to the last Canadian dollar. With every donation, you can get some awesome merchandise including: Posters,T-shirts,CD'S,DVD'S. Also, you may get to be an extra in our movie or even have a romantic date with the whole band.</p>
<p>We are fully aware that just like us, not everyone has the means to donate free-fully as much as they would like to. If this is the case for you but you'd still like to see us succeed with our goal, you can still help. Get this out there and let people know about our campaign. View and Share the original film and help create a buzz for us and this project. Anyone and Everyone can help and be apart of something that we know we will all be proud of.</p>

When starting this project, the then four member group was in a similar stage of their career as I was. We were just getting started on bringing our passions to reality. The project immediately ignited into something much more than what we expected. Since the making of this film, their talent in music and my knowledge in film has skyrocketed resulting in us being even more equipped to produce a high quality collaboration. With a heavy resume on my end and a recently released album with another on the way from them, we think it is perfect time to create a sequel showcasing the progression in both careers and continue the story of 'Caught in the Wildfire'.
One of our biggest struggles during our original production was producing a film while also being starving students. Not that any of us are pulling in anything close to big bucks now, but the first film was entirely made from nothing but creativity of the 5 involved parties. Though we will continue to be resourceful, we are seeking means to be able to let us take a step further in our production value by increase our capacity to book locations and rent necessary equipment. If our goal of $2000 is reached, we will be able to have the freedom to bring more production value to this project and step outside of amateur film making into a film festival worthy production.
Any money that is funded will go entirely towards this project. We are going to keep our followers up to date on where the money is going on our facebook page, from however much we start with to the last Canadian dollar. With every donation, you can get some awesome merchandise including: Posters,T-shirts,CD'S,DVD'S. Also, you may get to be an extra in our movie or even have a romantic date with the whole band.
We are fully aware that just like us, not everyone has the means to donate free-fully as much as they would like to. If this is the case for you but you'd still like to see us succeed with our goal, you can still help. Get this out there and let people know about our campaign. View and Share the original film and help create a buzz for us and this project. Anyone and Everyone can help and be apart of something that we know we will all be proud of.

<p><strong>""Don't Cry Over Spilt Eggnog""</strong> is a story about a tortured soul named Jarvis. Jarvis lives as a homeless man even though he has the resources to live a normal life. One night his sister Tracy ( who loves Jarvis very much ) and his sister Charlie (who is an uncaring bitch ) have Jarvis over to Tracy's trailer for an intervention to try to help him get off of the streets. Things do not go as Tracy planned, and an odd series of horrific events take place, revealing a dark secret about Jarvis. This is a short film with an estimated running time of 12-15 mins long.</p>

<br/> </div><div>
<h3>Challenges, Festival Goals and BEYOND!</h3>
<p>My goal with this film is to create an intriguing piece of story telling and bring it to the Film Festival circuit to be seen by as big of an audience as possible. I also intend to pitch the main character/concept for feature film or episodic development, as Jarvis is a complex character that could go in so many different directions. Some of the festivals I will be submitting to include the New Orleans Film Festival, SXSW, Toronto Film Fest, Sundance, Tribeca, AFI, Rhode Island Film Fest, Palm Springs Film Fest, Aspen ShortFest, Austin Film Fest, Telluride, and many more.</p>
<ul><li>
<strong>What if we don't reach our goal of $3000?</strong> Your funds will still go towards getting the film made, when I want to get something done I get it done and I ALWAYS  find a way. As a game developer it is part of my job to be a problem solver, filmmaking is very much the same thing, problem solving. If I am unable to get the film fully funded for $3k I will have to put on my problem solving hat and find a cheaper way to make the film. This would compromise the overall quality of the final product, which is something I would hate to do, I feel it would not be fair to the actors or the story, and this is why I am asking for help on IndieGoGo. </li></ul>

One night his sister Tracy ( who loves Jarvis very much ) and his sister Charlie (who is an uncaring bitch ) have Jarvis over to Tracy's trailer for an intervention to try to help him get off of the streets. Things do not go as Tracy planned, and an odd series of horrific events take place, revealing a dark secret about Jarvis. This is a short film with an estimated running time of 12-15 mins long.
My name is Michael Patrick Rogers and I am the writer/director of ""Don't Cry Over Spilt Eggnog"". I am an indie game producer known for making really strange games based on personal experiences using dark atmosphere and unique characters. I've released two games on the Steam platform (""The Lady""  and ""The Grandfather"" ) and am currently working on my third, I've sold nearly 20K games since Jan of 2015. ""Don't Cry Over Spilt Eggnog"" will be my first film under the same label as my games, and is an extension of the style of storytelling that I use in my games. To give you an idea of my storytelling style here is an example from my current release ""The Grandfather"", this is the short film version of the game. Some of my biggest influences include David Lynch, John Carpenter, Rob Zombie, Wes Craven, and Paul Thomas Anderson.​WE ARE FILMING ON MAY 6TH, PLEASE FOLLOW THE FILM ON FACEBOOK!
 

Meet the Actors
Jarvis is being portrayed by Chip Carriere  Chip is a diverse actor with a background in theater and vocal groups, this will be Chip's darkest and most emotionally challenging role to date. Some of Chip's credits include Zoo (CBS), NCIS New Orleans, Focus, Joe Dirt 2, and Underground. Tracy is being portrayed by Rachel Whittle Rachel is a powerful actress who's range is very impressive, her range will be on full display in her portrayal of Tracy. Some of Rachel's credits include the lead in an upcoming Lifetime movie called ""Mother of the Year"", Scream the TV series (MTV), Zombie Shark (SyFy), and Cryptid: The Swamp Best. Charlie is being portrayed by Amy Wickenheiser Amy is an actress from Regina Saskatchewan , some of her credits include The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn  Part 2, and The Shelter. Amy and Rachel are real life close friends, which will make great chemistry for the ""loving sister/bitch sister"" contrast in the script. 
 
Challenges, Festival Goals and BEYOND!
My goal with this film is to create an intriguing piece of story telling and bring it to the Film Festival circuit to be seen by as big of an audience as possible. I also intend to pitch the main character/concept for feature film or episodic development, as Jarvis is a complex character that could go in so many different directions. Some of the festivals I will be submitting to include the New Orleans Film Festival, SXSW, Toronto Film Fest, Sundance, Tribeca, AFI, Rhode Island Film Fest, Palm Springs Film Fest, Aspen ShortFest, Austin Film Fest, Telluride, and many more.

What if we don't reach our goal of $3000? Your funds will still go towards getting the film made, when I want to get something done I get it done and I ALWAYS  find a way. As a game developer it is part of my job to be a problem solver, filmmaking is very much the same thing, problem solving. If I am unable to get the film fully funded for $3k I will have to put on my problem solving hat and find a cheaper way to make the film. This would compromise the overall quality of the final product, which is something I would hate to do, I feel it would not be fair to the actors or the story, and this is why I am asking for help on IndieGoGo. 

Other Ways You Can Help
One way to help is to follow the film on Facebook and to share our campaign on Facebook/Twitter and all of your social media. Please consider using the IndieGoGo sharing tools to let your friends know about our campaign. In  addition to this IndieGoGo campaign, we have a separate ongoing GoFundMe specifically for helping fund our festival submissions, which can add up and be very expensive, $5 on our GoFundMe will go a long way in helping, and there's also a simple $20 reward on the GoFundMe which will secure you a digital download of the film (after our festival run). Thank you for taking the time to read our campaign, I hope you will consider helping out in anyway you can by choosing a reward from the Perks section, and please feel free to email me with any questions about the film at MPRart@Gmail.comFollow Michael Patrick Rogers on TwitterFollow Michael Patrick Rogers on Instagram Follow Michael Patrick Rogers on Snapchat @ IEatWaffleHouse",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> We come from different places such as Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece, and have all converged in the colourful and multicultural city of Barcelona to pursue careers in the art and movie industry.</p>
<p> Our backgrounds are varied, we have members with experience in film and television, some that work in the theater and others from such areas as fine arts, psychology, advertising, fashion design and architecture. We are also working with first-time actors for the roles of the children, which is a challenge we are eager to undertake.</p>
<p> This campaign aims to take our concept to a higher level of production, shooting with higher value and image quality all-around. We believe we have a unique idea that, if invested in, could find its way into movie festival circuits and the hearts of auteur film-enthusiasts around the world. It means a lot to us as young people who want to build a career in this area, to have this kind of visibility and recognition for our work.</p>
<p> We want to explore some very personal themes in human relations, such as the frailty of childhood when exposed to the harshness of the real world, and feelings of displacement and loss in life, as one approaches death.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> We need at least an additional 5000 euros to cover the expenses of production.</p>
<ul>
<li>Since this will be a very visual story with a lot of set manipulation, we have 1000 euros projected just for art direction, for things such as set design and materials to use on set.</li>
<li>Another 1000 will be for make-up, costumes and lighting.</li>
<li>The biggest part of our budget (at least 2000) will go towards the rental of film equipment to improve the quality of the finished project. A high quality camera with screen, equipment to make travelling-shots possible and sound equipment are among the things we will invest in.</li>
<li>500 euros will be directed to the distribution of the movie once its finished, meaning the entrance fees for prestigious festivals,</li>
<li>the remaining 500 will be for the catering and travel fees for the cast and crew.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p> How do you make a movie out of an idea, a picture or even a word?</p>
<p>The process of making an independent movie from scratch is a journey we are happy to share with you, from concept art to film, passing by script, location scouting, castings, storyboarding and gathering the crew. Meet us for the shooting and be a part of this project, attend the premiere and have dinner with the team, get one of our exclusive posters signed by the whole team!</p>
<p> Any funding will help us improve the quality of our original idea, so any money we can gather from this platform will be put into that. If we fail to achieve our goal we will direct the money towards what we consider to be the priorities to improve the quality of the movie.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project reflects the paradigm of the independent filmmaking circuit, from which stem numerous personal and thought-provoking ideas, that try to break through the layer of commonality that exists in the mainstream.</p>
<p>We want to make something that is equal parts enjoyable and distressing, something that does not leave the viewer indifferent after watching it, because that is the cinema we love and the one we would love to see more of.</p>
<p>This speaks to the forgotten child in all of us, the one we hid from the world in order to protect it. It delves into the things that scorched us as children, our traumas, and how we learn to deal with them.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>An independent production is always a volatile thing, everyone is working for free on the time they have off from their jobs and public locations are always hard to control. We are however very confident in our preparation and in the team we have working on this project, we are already in a rehearsal stage and we see things going very smoothly during shooting and post-production.</p>
<p>We have planned everything obsessively since October of last year and have already spoken to all the entities that allow for shooting on location, so everything is ready for shooting.</p>

<h3>What Makes This Project Unique</h3>
<p>Marina Aguerre is a senior film production student at the Loyola Marymount University School of Film and Television with a background in theatre and visual arts. She is also an avid gamer and personally understands the implications of creating entire relationships online. This short film has been 2 years in the making.</p>
<p>We are creating a short film that pools together the different incredible talents available to us from our peer group, including 3-D Animation by a team of students, graphics by an LMU alumn, original score by a multi-instrumental musician, and visual design by a group of experienced filmmakers. </p>
<p>This project is unique in that we include artists from all backgrounds to create a diverse and distinguished crew. <i>Your help will ensure that we can provide each artist involved with the necessary tools to render an artistic, visually striking story.</i></p>

<p><strong>Synopsis</strong></p>
<p>The latest work of occult artist Miki Aurora, <i>Death, Resurrection, Ascenion</i> marks the artist’s premier foray into the medium of film with a work that blurs the divide between arthouse movie and documentary.

<p>Throughout the course of the ceremony, the two women oscillate between various frontiers of the seeker’s psyche, as Aurora engages with occult technologies in an effort to aid in the excavation process of psychological trauma from within the subconscious mind of her cohort. As her layers unfold, a window into the shrouded world of the ritual arts is opened, a world rich with canonical visions, and iconography surrounding the work’s scriptural namesake--told through the swan song of one woman’s archetypal sorrow.</p>

</div><p> </p><p>Lili, Soledad and Ofelia are three young deaf women, who live in La Casona, a cocoa farm located in a lost bay on the coasts of Venezuela that can only be reached by boat. The communication between the girls and Augusto; The farm owner; Is a constant uncertainty. He does not know how to speak in sign language and they don't know how to read or write. In spite of this, the young women take care of all the domestic work in the Casona.</p><p>One day an accident happened  in the cocoa farm and Augusto is forced to look for help in the nearest town. He meets Margarita, a hypoacusic photographer, an expert in sign language who thanks to a cochlear implant can speak and listen perfectly. She will have the difficult task of teaching each one of the girls to communicate through the Venezuelan sign language. However, the arrival of Margarita will encourage Lili, Soledad and Ofelia to start a revolution that will break with the orthodox rules of Augusto. The Girls will have to decide if they stay on the farm under Augusto's rules or go out and discover what's beyond the sea.</p><p>-</p><p>This is a story about the fear to the unknow but also it’s a story about accepting yourself the way you are. Why is this so important?

So, after a year of constant questioning about story and a lot of trial and error, we achieved a final version.</p><p>My intention with our film is to create awareness about the deaf culture so that the listeners learn to speak more with our hands and less with our mouth. That way we can realize that as much as we worry about learning another language, we can learn sign language too. And the same way try to speak with any foreigner, we take the time and effort to speak with our deaf brothers. Because deafness is not an inability but a lifestyle.

The Girls will have to decide if they stay on the farm under Augusto's rules or go out and discover what's beyond the sea.-This is a story about the fear to the unknow but also it’s a story about accepting yourself the way you are. Why is this so important? Well, this will be a Sign language shortfilm and we want to create conscience about deaf culture, to encourage people to learn sign lenguague.When I came up with the idea of ​​telling a story about a group of girls who live with auditory sensory diversity, but nevertheless are capable enough to keep a whole cacao farm afloat, i started to realize that deep down I was writing a story about discoveries.Despite being a photographer, I have always believed that the script is the most important thing before making a film and for that reason I took the decision with Gabriel Marín; Co-writer, to dedicate as much time as possible to write the script. So, after a year of constant questioning about story and a lot of trial and error, we achieved a final version.My intention with our film is to create awareness about the deaf culture so that the listeners learn to speak more with our hands and less with our mouth. That way we can realize that as much as we worry about learning another language, we can learn sign language too. And the same way try to speak with any foreigner, we take the time and effort to speak with our deaf brothers. Because deafness is not an inability but a lifestyle. And if they are able to overcome all their fears despite their lifestyle, why cant we be able to overcome ours?CASTCREWWHAT WE NEED?We're trying to raise $5,000 to cover production and post-production costs of the shortfilm.WHERE THE MONEY WILL GO?REWARDSIf you help us, you will have wonderful rewards  that includes Venezuelan Cocoa (The best cocoa in the world) and exclusive updates from the shortfilm and much more. Be sure to check out our list of perks in exchange for your donations.FAQWhen do I receive my perks?We will begin to send our perks (only cocoa) on April 2017 via DHL, the Blu-ray copies will be sent on july 2017.When will the film be finished?We will finish the short film on july 2017 after all production and post-production process are done.What will we do with the exceeded goal money?

<h3>About the film</h3>
<p>PINK is an upcoming short, it's a story about a drug deal gone wrong. After three petty criminals are trapped in a warehouse by an unseen entity, the group accidentally inhale a new powerful drug called PINK, now the group must escape before the psychedelic substance kicks in and they start losing there minds.... </p>
<p>PINK's overall goal is to recreate the wild and anarchic style of transgressive cinema that was last seen during the '70s.  In recreating a style of cinema that was both wild and brimming with ideas, our film PINK takes on a number of different influences, both thematically and from the written word. The colourful, violently vivid and baroque films of Dario Argento provided a huge inspiration for PINK. The works of cosmic writer H.P. Lovecraft have also proven a large influence towards our film. Due to part of our film dealing with mind expanding drugs, Lovecraft's stories of cosmic terror serve as the prime inspiration. Combining these main influences as well as our unique approach to our film genre, PINK is a thrilling, dark and psychedelic new breed of film that we have dubbed: 'Acid Thriller'.</p>
<p>PINK will be 10-15 minutes long and shot and edited between the months of February &amp; May around Portsmouth, England. It is planned to be premiered at the BFI and will be shown at various other film industry events.</p>
<p> </p>
<div>
<h3>Where's is the money going?</h3>
<p>All donations will be spent on:</p>
<ul>
<li>CAST &amp; CREW: this includes transport for our professional actors to come down to Portsmouth for the shoot, accommodation for them to stay during the filming (due to filming early hours of the morning) and food to keep them fed.</li>
<li>PROPS: make up and practical effects: PINK will feature a number of practical effects which will require us to hire make up artists and the various materials to make these effects come to life. Some of the props include vehicles, weapons, chemistry equipment and various other pieces of set dressing.</li>
<li>LOCATION AND FEES: Due to the nature of our film, Pink will take place in a number of bizarre and atmospheric locations, these locations include a military fort, World War 2 tunnels, and potentially a closed down casino.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your donations will go towards making this the best possible way of achieving the purest vision of the film. Our film PINK will be made regardless, but the contributions we receive will go towards improving the visuals of the film. This includes the special effects, locations as well as the overall production of the film.</p>
<p>Your donations will really help us achieve our dream for this film, without your support we wouldn't be able to film the entire production at night or get skilled actors involved. Money in this case is essentially due to location cost and putting our actors up in hotels as we plan to film early hours of the morning in remote locations. PINK also requires a number of props such as a cross bow, a car and chemistry equipment.</p>
<ul></ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Most of the challenges we as a group face are to do with locations, the first is the fees of some of the potential locations. Ensuring we obtain the locations is a huge aspect that will ultimately determine the success of our film. Equipment hire and cast availability as well as working to a tight deadline all serve as existing changes that we as a group must face. To ensure quality is not lost we have created a tight schedule that takes into consideration filming on locations and the number of days it will take to shoot PINK. We have one of the top editors who will ensure all visual effects and colour will be the best it can be. We will be shooting on an Arri Alexa, which is provided by the University of Portsmouth.</p>

<p><strong>""There's a sense of Workaholics, The Hangover, and There's Something About Mary with a Judd Apatow vibe that is infused in the writing.""</strong> <i>-Tory  Devon Smith, Actor: Netflix's The Get Down</i></p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Making a film is hard work. Not everything goes as planned. We are aware of the challenges and the need to grow and adapt during the creative process. The risks of independent filmmaking are lack of funding, minimal resources, playing within actor and crew union rules, needing to call in favors, and marketing the film in an over saturated industry. By pledging funds to this project, you will help us achieve our goal. </p>
<p>How do we find success? With originality, boundary-pushing jokes and scenes, proper itemized budgeting, deferring payments to the creative team, utilizing locations we already have access to, and trusting in each others' abilities to get the job done right!</p>

His bouts with the drug have been extremely taxing on Rose, who always envisioned Desi going on to do something exceptional with his life.</p><p>Desi seemed to find something of a balance in his life when he met Jade, another longtime heroin addict, in rehab. They shared a common bond through their battles with drug addiction and depression, and helped each other stay clean. Yet as time went by, they found themselves giving in to their demons once again, and it’s in the midst of this relapse period that Jade turns up dead.</p><p>While Desi finds himself back in his mother’s care for the first time in years, a veteran detective attempts to discover the truth behind what happened to Jade…</p><h3>HOW YOU CAN HELP!</h3><p>There are a number of ways you can help bring <i>Devotion</i> to the big screen in 2018. We'll be filming the feature in the Detroit, Michigan area this September. We're currently in the process of looking for some additional crew and talent based in Michigan for the shoot. If you're available and able or you know anyone available and able, we'd love to be connected. We have an array of different side characters to cast, the biggest need being women in their 50s/60s to play Rose’s friends, and we’ll need help in various areas of production during the shoot.</p><p>We're also in the midst of securing locations for the film. We're looking for a few more houses to use and we're in need of a dive bar and an office room as well. </p><p>You can also help by spreading this campaign around. Follow us on social media (devotion2018 on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter) and share the link to this page with your friends and followers.</p><p>Any donations you make to the crowdfunding campaign will go a long way in supporting the production. The primary cost of the production will be equipment but we also need funds to feed our cast and crew on set and for transportation and housing for some of our out of town cast and crew members. There'll also be several costs associated with post-production, after the film is cut, such as sound mixing. Following that, we'll need to pay for festival submissions and most likely publicity.</p><h3>
<strong>THE BIG PICTURE </strong> </h3><p>The hope with <i>Devotion</i> is that it will have a strong run in prominent film festivals that will lead to it being purchased by a distributer. It will then have a theatrical run before becoming available through streaming services. </p><p>Amazon and Netflix are bloodthirsty for standout indie films. Here's a great Wired article about their approaches, after their active purchasing at Sundance in 2016:</p><p><a href=""https://www.wired.com/2016/01/netflix-and-amazon-offer-indie-filmmakers-hope-and-lots-of-money/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.wired.com/2016/01/netflix-and-amazon-offer-indie-filmmakers-hope-and-lots-of-money/</a></p><p>Films are meant to be seen on the big screen amongst a crowd of other filmgoers. We know the film will have interest from a streaming distribution standpoint, but we want more. We want the film to be shown in as many theaters across the nation as possible.</p><h3>MEET THE TEAM!</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488814169/wvjxboukkbrbapkrptuv.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><strong>Andrew Ericksen – Writer/Director</strong></p><p>Andrew's written several feature film scripts, one of which was a Second Round Selection at the 2016 Austin Film Festival.

His bouts with the drug have been extremely taxing on Rose, who always envisioned Desi going on to do something exceptional with his life.Desi seemed to find something of a balance in his life when he met Jade, another longtime heroin addict, in rehab. They shared a common bond through their battles with drug addiction and depression, and helped each other stay clean. Yet as time went by, they found themselves giving in to their demons once again, and it’s in the midst of this relapse period that Jade turns up dead.While Desi finds himself back in his mother’s care for the first time in years, a veteran detective attempts to discover the truth behind what happened to Jade…HOW YOU CAN HELP!There are a number of ways you can help bring Devotion to the big screen in 2018. We'll be filming the feature in the Detroit, Michigan area this September. We're currently in the process of looking for some additional crew and talent based in Michigan for the shoot. If you're available and able or you know anyone available and able, we'd love to be connected. We have an array of different side characters to cast, the biggest need being women in their 50s/60s to play Rose’s friends, and we’ll need help in various areas of production during the shoot.We're also in the midst of securing locations for the film. We're looking for a few more houses to use and we're in need of a dive bar and an office room as well. You can also help by spreading this campaign around. Follow us on social media (devotion2018 on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter) and share the link to this page with your friends and followers.Any donations you make to the crowdfunding campaign will go a long way in supporting the production. The primary cost of the production will be equipment but we also need funds to feed our cast and crew on set and for transportation and housing for some of our out of town cast and crew members. There'll also be several costs associated with post-production, after the film is cut, such as sound mixing. Following that, we'll need to pay for festival submissions and most likely publicity.
THE BIG PICTURE  The hope with Devotion is that it will have a strong run in prominent film festivals that will lead to it being purchased by a distributer. It will then have a theatrical run before becoming available through streaming services. Amazon and Netflix are bloodthirsty for standout indie films. Here's a great Wired article about their approaches, after their active purchasing at Sundance in 2016:https://www.wired.com/2016/01/netflix-and-amazon-offer-indie-filmmakers-hope-and-lots-of-money/Films are meant to be seen on the big screen amongst a crowd of other filmgoers. We know the film will have interest from a streaming distribution standpoint, but we want more. We want the film to be shown in as many theaters across the nation as possible.MEET THE TEAM!Andrew Ericksen – Writer/DirectorAndrew's written several feature film scripts, one of which was a Second Round Selection at the 2016 Austin Film Festival.

<h2>The Story: </h2>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><b>APPLE BLOSSOM</b></h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Genre: Black Comedy, Road Movie</p>
<p>Young Jack hasn't always been the most rational in his life choices. When he decides to hitchhike fromTennessee to Kentucky in the name of love, he finds he may have bitten off more than he can chew. </p>
<p>Potential backers of this project would aid the filmmakers in tackling the biggest challenge of travelling down to the Tennessee Valley and creating a beautiful project on the mountainous highways and back-roads of Johnson City, TN. </p>
<p>This particular project is very near and dear to our hearts. It is our way of paying homage to a dearly beloved friend who passed two years ago. The writer, Brianna Dorn, has tried to honor his legacy by including him in the script as one of the few people to help Jack along in his journey. If we can somehow bring this project into fruition, it would be one of numerous ways of showing his loved ones - and the world - the light that he was capable of bringing to others within his short time on this earth.</p>

<h2>What We Need:</h2>
<h3>We need about $2000 to complete funding for our project!</h3>
<p>This is a Senior Directing Project within a module at Northwestern University. The University has already gifted us $1500, but we need an extra $2000 in order to cover the costs of travel to shoot on location, as well as to help pay for the cost of shipping equipment to and from location. Below is a quick breakdown of the budget:</p>
<ul>
<li>About $1000 is going towards covering the cost of travels for the director, actors and cinematographer.</li>
<li>About $1070 is going towards paying for the shipment/rental of basic film equipment needed on our set.</li>
<li>Around $250 + will go towards feeding our cast and crew</li>
<li>Around $680 will paying for lodging whilst in Tennessee</li>
<li>All leftover funds will help pay for professional sound design on the film following wrapped production (about $500)!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h2>The Impact:</h2>
<p>We believe that anyone who has ever experienced grief can understand how difficult it is to find positive outlets for expressing the memories that are left behind. This project is just that outlet for many members of the team.</p>
<p>In addition, Apple Blossom also tells the story of a young man who, even in this day and age, can’t afford a bus ticket and thus must walk to his destination – which is the kind of narrative that hardly ever reaches the light of day. We believe that every story has the right to be told - especially by those who don't fit into society's mold of normality.</p>
</div><div>
<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges:</h2>
<p>If we are unable to reach our funding goal, it will be near impossible for us to be able to create this piece in the way that it should and needs to be told. </p>
<p>In the event that we do not reach our <i>full</i> goal, we will make due with what we have raised to fulfill this project to the best of our ability, but it would difficult. This would still require at least 50% of what we are asking to make this project in the <i>most minimalist</i> way possible.</p>

Join us in making a student short film that will showcase this message. Your donation will help filmmakers grow their story-telling abilities, actors develop their character performance skills, and your buddy, Danny Munoz, will be able to graduate on time.  This thesis film isn't just about me being able to graduate on time. It's about building character and touching people's hearts through the medium of cinema. This film is for the three women in my family who have supported me so this far and have encouraged me to chase my dreams. My mother and two sisters are the reason why I decided to create this film which showcases a strong female character as the story's lead protagonist - Rainbow.THE STORY OF MATCHMATCH  is about two socks, Lefty - our male lead and Rainbow - our female lead, who undertake a dangerous journey to find love's true match. Having to navigate through a busy laundromat where humans are washing their clothes, Lefty and Rainbow discover more about what a ""match"" means.Lefty has lost his match to a marauding janitor and desperately goes for help. Behind the laundry machines lies a cardboard sock city where Lefty encounters Rainbow who lends her assistance.As the main heroine of the story, Rainbow helps Lefty during a painful time of his life. She gives Lefty the hope that he will find his perfect match. Although their journey is wrought with uncertainty, Rainbow and Lefty give each other hope that things will get better. Love comes in many forms - each and everyone of us has a match. WHO IS MAKING THIS?Danny Muñoz is a video editor when he is not focusing on school work and a 3D animator while finishing his BA in animation at the school of cinematic arts in USC. He loves both video editing and animation, however he is taken more of an editorial route for his career path. He got his jumpstart into the world of editing from the short film “Shellshock” (2013). As a first time editor, he was not afraid of the challenge, and the result of his efforts lead him to win “Best Editor” while attending UCSB. After working in many short narrative film works, and expanding to new mediums such as trailers, sizzles, documentaries, and a feature, he was fortunate to have earned internships with NBC Bravo Digital, Trailer Park, and freelance work with National Geographic for “La Cuba De Hoy” as additional editor. He currently is working under Davis Guggenheim on upcoming work.Danie Hakimi has spent most of her life producing, directing, and designing for different creative projects and events. Her past work includes producing and developing an animation/video game industry event called Graphic Voices, serving as production manager on a stop-motion short, directing a number of short plays, and acting as assistant director and costume designer for a number of large scale theater productions. When she’s not working with Danny on ‘Match’, she acts as producer, designer, and story artist for another upcoming animated short (which she’s very excited about) and works part-time in a Los Angeles cafe. She also practices illustration, creates cosplays, talks to her dogs, and reads graphic novels when she finds time to sit still. For more life and work updates, you can find her on Twitter @Danie_Hakimi Margaret Spencer is a concept designer studying animation at the school of cinematic arts in USC. She just recently won the 12th annual NYTVF 2016 along with her team and landed a development deal with Bento Box for their upcoming show. When she is not studying, she focuses on fan art, character designs, and landscape drawings all in digital and paper. Follow her on Tumblr: http://mmspencerart.tumblr.com/ Tracey Aivaz is a director and actor from Burbank, CA. She is currently studying Film & TV Production at the University of Southern California. Through filmmaking, she would like to tell stories that express powerful ideas and deeper messages to connect with a wide audience. She's keen on emphasizing the importance of standing up and being stronger every time life knocks one down. Aivaz is an avid feminist. She plans to represent women’s voices and visions that have not been represented much at all in cinema and show that women can go beyond the glass ceilings that have been imposed upon them. She likes to take a narrative approach to her stories rather than documentary.

<p>My name is Ken Wolf. I am a Yogi, a Personal Trainer, an Actor, a Playwright and the Artistic Director of Manhattan Repertory Theatre in New York City.</p>
<p>13 years ago, I developed severe PTSD and conversion disorder from training in Yoga. As I entered my second 200 hour Yoga Teacher training, I started to feel random emotion coming out of my body as I did Yoga.  I was fascinated by what was going on so I started working with a Yoga trainer privately and I dove in deeper, and I re-traumatized my nervous system from an old forgotten abusive event that was somehow trapped, lost in my body.  I developed severe PTSD where my body would literally bounce around somatically, my muscles would cramp unexpectedly, and I experienced random crazy emotion emanating from my body. I was so frightened, so I started filming my PTSD experience as I searched for a cure.  I made a commitment to myself that I would cure myself and then help people with similar issues.</p>
<p>I filmed over 200 hours of Yoga sessions, psychotherapy sessions where I literally bounced as I did the work, along with video journals of my daily experience dealing with my severe affliction.</p>
<p>After three years, I cured myself 100% of my affliction, after learning a myriad of ways to deal with the PTSD and conversion disorder through Yoga and physical body work, and simple mental techniques to deal with random emotion.</p>
<p>The story didn't end there. I didn't know the source of the trauma that caused my affliction. But through the help of my sister, Margie Wolf, together, we discovered the source of my trauma. I was savagely beaten with a baseball bat by a neighbor.</p>
<p>This documentary will tell our story, but more importantly, it will offer information and support for individuals who suffer from PTSD, conversion disorder and random anxiety.  We want to get this information out to the world.</p>
<p>In conjunction with <strong>The People in my Hips</strong> documentary, we are going to release <strong>The People in my Hips</strong> IPAD IBOOK which will document my story, and my strategies to deal with my affliction, along with real video from my battle with PTSD and more.</p>
<p>And we are going to start the website <strong>HEALINGANDMOVINGON.com</strong> which will be a place for people to share their stories of healing, and to voice their pain, where we intend to create a community to help individuals who suffer from the trauma of abuse.</p>

And these disorders are treatable, and curable, even with severe abuse.

<strong>What will ""The Clexa Project"" be doing, exactly?</strong> </h3><p>The project will be exploring how the mainstream media misrepresents, baits, and erases diverse LGBTQ+ characters, specifically queer women and their corresponding relationships. With the support and participation of various stakeholders in the movement, we will be producing this film with the intention of cultivating a culture that humanizes diverse communities and challenges limiting media stereotypes.</p><p>We believe that the LGBTQ+ community deserves better the same way we believe all marginalized communities deserve better. Not only are queer and trans experiences misrepresented or excluded on some level, but there's also very little positive representation of LGBTQ+ people of color as well as folks with other ignored intersections (i.e. disability, size, class, religious affiliation, documentation, etc.). This documentary aims to illustrate the necessity and beauty in implementing authentic, intersectional media representation. </p><p>Negative stereotypes have the capacity to perpetuate discrimination; unrealistic standards provoke low self-esteem; and compulsive heteronormativity ultimately erases queer and trans folks' humanity. Since the media influences the young minds of our future generations, we think it's vital and necessary to keep the conversation going. </p><h3>
<strong>But, why ""Clexa""?</strong> </h3><p>Clexa is named after the portmanteau or ""ship"" of two iconic LGBTQ+ characters, Clarke and Lexa, from the tv show CW's <i>The 100</i>. Following the sudden and violent death of Lexa (a mere 64 seconds after their love scene) the storyline inspired fans to push for positive representation and raised over $100K for <a href=""http://www.thetrevorproject.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Trevor Project</a> with the help of <a href=""http://lgbtfansdeservebetter.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">LGBT Fans Deserve Better</a>.</p><p>The 2015/2016 TV season alone has managed to kill off an unprecedented number of queer women characters belonging to an already underrepresented community, further perpetuating the ""Bury Your Gays"" trope. For more information on this trope, please visit the <a href=""http://lgbtfansdeservebetter.com/blog/2016/08/08/a-trope-by-any-other-name/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">LGBT Fans Deserve Better website</a>.</p><p>Although 'Clexa' was indeed a catalyst for us, we know that the current state of the movement is much deeper and more complex than one fandom. It is our mission to cover representation as it relates to diverse queer women using an inclusive and intersectional lens, utilizing 'Clexa' in a symbolic sense along the way.</p><h3><strong>Who are you, anyway? </strong></h3><p>We are a few queer college students from California exercising our passion for inclusivity, grassroots activism, and everything Clexa. Funding this film out of our own pockets, we will be relying on your generous donations to make the highest quality documentary we possibly can.</p><p>While pursuing gender and sexuality studies, we also volunteer for our community and work part-time for our university’s student-run activist center. This work has allowed us tremendous experience in designing, planning, and marketing of various women-, queer-, and trans-centered events and resources.</p><p>We hold this project near and dear to our hearts, meaning we will stop at nothing to create something our community deserves: a beautiful and respectful documentation of our struggle, experiences, and mobilization following so many unparalled deaths of fictional queer folk. We will be pouring all of the money, time, and energy we can spare into this project. Everything you give towards and beyond our budget will be used in the most innovative, responsible way we can muster. </p><p><i>We are also currently in the processing of identifying and adding new members to the project team. If this is something that interests you, please tweet at @theclexaproject or email us at theclexaproject@gmail.com for more information. </i></p><h3><strong>So, how much are you asking for?</strong></h3><p>After a lot of careful calculation, we are asking for contributions supporting a relatively low budget of $2500. Funds generated from this campaign will be allocated to the following:</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>Equipment and Post Production Costs</i><br/>Our film will look and sound better with higher quality cameras, lenses, microphones, tripods, memory cards, external hard-drives, editing software, and any other necessary equipment. We want to ensure that the final product is filmed, edited, and polished so that it’s something we will all enjoy watching. </p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>Transportation</i><br/>This film would not be anything without an array of diverse interviews concerning the most relevant stakeholders in the queer representation movement and diverse media representation in general. In order to conduct these, we’ll need to pay for gas and sometimes stay when visiting “krus” on the west coast. </p><h3>

With the support and participation of various stakeholders in the movement, we will be producing this film with the intention of cultivating a culture that humanizes diverse communities and challenges limiting media stereotypes.We believe that the LGBTQ+ community deserves better the same way we believe all marginalized communities deserve better. Not only are queer and trans experiences misrepresented or excluded on some level, but there's also very little positive representation of LGBTQ+ people of color as well as folks with other ignored intersections (i.e. disability, size, class, religious affiliation, documentation, etc.). This documentary aims to illustrate the necessity and beauty in implementing authentic, intersectional media representation. Negative stereotypes have the capacity to perpetuate discrimination; unrealistic standards provoke low self-esteem; and compulsive heteronormativity ultimately erases queer and trans folks' humanity. Since the media influences the young minds of our future generations, we think it's vital and necessary to keep the conversation going. 
But, why ""Clexa""? Clexa is named after the portmanteau or ""ship"" of two iconic LGBTQ+ characters, Clarke and Lexa, from the tv show CW's The 100. Following the sudden and violent death of Lexa (a mere 64 seconds after their love scene) the storyline inspired fans to push for positive representation and raised over $100K for The Trevor Project with the help of LGBT Fans Deserve Better.The 2015/2016 TV season alone has managed to kill off an unprecedented number of queer women characters belonging to an already underrepresented community, further perpetuating the ""Bury Your Gays"" trope. For more information on this trope, please visit the LGBT Fans Deserve Better website.Although 'Clexa' was indeed a catalyst for us, we know that the current state of the movement is much deeper and more complex than one fandom. It is our mission to cover representation as it relates to diverse queer women using an inclusive and intersectional lens, utilizing 'Clexa' in a symbolic sense along the way.Who are you, anyway? We are a few queer college students from California exercising our passion for inclusivity, grassroots activism, and everything Clexa. Funding this film out of our own pockets, we will be relying on your generous donations to make the highest quality documentary we possibly can.While pursuing gender and sexuality studies, we also volunteer for our community and work part-time for our university’s student-run activist center. This work has allowed us tremendous experience in designing, planning, and marketing of various women-, queer-, and trans-centered events and resources.We hold this project near and dear to our hearts, meaning we will stop at nothing to create something our community deserves: a beautiful and respectful documentation of our struggle, experiences, and mobilization following so many unparalled deaths of fictional queer folk. We will be pouring all of the money, time, and energy we can spare into this project. Everything you give towards and beyond our budget will be used in the most innovative, responsible way we can muster. We are also currently in the processing of identifying and adding new members to the project team. If this is something that interests you, please tweet at @theclexaproject or email us at theclexaproject@gmail.com for more information. So, how much are you asking for?After a lot of careful calculation, we are asking for contributions supporting a relatively low budget of $2500. Funds generated from this campaign will be allocated to the following:Equipment and Post Production CostsOur film will look and sound better with higher quality cameras, lenses, microphones, tripods, memory cards, external hard-drives, editing software, and any other necessary equipment. We want to ensure that the final product is filmed, edited, and polished so that it’s something we will all enjoy watching. TransportationThis film would not be anything without an array of diverse interviews concerning the most relevant stakeholders in the queer representation movement and diverse media representation in general. In order to conduct these, we’ll need to pay for gas and sometimes stay when visiting “krus” on the west coast. 
What if I can't afford to contribute? You can still support us by spreading the word! Help us make some noise by encouraging the people in your life to get involved as well. Everyone can play a role, because at the end of the day positive and diverse media representation benefits everyone. Remember to use the Indiegogo share tools!Thank you all so much in advance for your support and consideration.

<p>Where Is My Mind? tells the story of Liam, a quiet, antisocial teenager who shows signs of suffering from autism. Throughout his life, Liam has had one friend, one confident, someone who has been alongside him through thick and thin. This is Jacob. Jacob is everything Liam wishes he could be. Jacob is suave, cocky and cool. Despite the two being so different, their bond has become unbreakable throughout their lives. However, there is one problem. Jacob's cocky attitude often gets Liam into situations he isn't able to defend himself in.</p>
<p>One day after Liam finishes school, Jacob gets him seriously beaten up by the resident school bullies. Liam is rushed to hospital and is placed in an induced coma, due to life threatening injuries. However, when he is in the coma, he also finds himself in a strange, exaggerated dream world with Jacob. Events that take place in the real world, where Liam lies in hospital, fighting for his life, transcend into the dream world. Everything is trying to get through to Liam and tell him that this world and in fact Jacob, aren't real and that Liam needs to wake up. Will Liam be able to break Jacob's hold on him and escape the dream world, or will he become trapped inside his own mind forever?</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Why Is It Important?</h3>
<p>We believe that mental illness has been stereotyped and negatively portrayed in film for too long. Sufferers of mental illness are consistently shown as violent, unhinged protagonists, such as Hannibal Lecter in Silence Of The Lambs. Mental illness is also frequently used in comedies for cheap, offensive laughs, often at the expense of the mental illness sufferer. We hope to portray mental illness in a positive, accurate light through our film, whilst also creating something that is engaging and exciting to watch.</p>

We have received very good reviews from friends and colleagues who suggest we should compete in film festivals by saying we have a great movie and, although it's a bit scary: we want to try it, we want to compete!Until now, we found friends and family who decided to support us and pay some of these festivals submissions fees. However, we do this crowdfunding campaign because we believe that, as in filmmaking, we can do more things if we work together as a team. And it's precisely at this moment that we need you, so we can submit our short film to different film festivals and show ""Salta"" to the world!We want to compete in the most important film festivals: LA Film Festival, Outfest Los Angeles, Brussels Short Film Festival, Toronto International Film Festival, Austin Film Festival, Iris Prize, Raindance Film Festival, Holly Shorts, Heartland Film Festival, BendFilm Festival, Cucalorus and more!Besides this, we have to buy some Blu-ray's and pen-drives for distribution, we want to print some posters and postcards for advertising purposes.  However, although we can not offer too much in return we want to thank you for your help with some rewards like the original music, making-of pictures, a pass to a festival near you and more!If you can not collaborate with our campaign, share this link by clicking any of the share buttons (facebook, twitter).

<h3>The Story of 'Swipe Right'</h3>
<p>‘Swipe Right’ is a MGM-styled musical comedy set in the modern era of internet dating. The film will feature four original musical numbers in the style of the Great American Songbook, but also will focus on the modern effects on dating culture with 21st century technology.  </p>
<p>The film follows college student, Miles during a voyage through the world of internet dating over the course of one night in New York City. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I’m expected to begin shooting in January, and without some sort of budget for production, this film will be very difficult. The app in the film is called “Adoor” (pronounced ‘adore’), which many of the characters use in the film. I need an animator, and a graphic designer to work side by side design this app for the characters to use on screen. I’m also looking for motion graphics to appear on screen, whenever the characters type texts, or messages via social media. This is crucial, because a problem that Hollywood struggles with nowadays, is how to make our ever growing, non-stop world of texting entertaining and presentable on camera. With the use of graphics, we can see these characters reading, and typing a text message, instead of showing a mundane camera shot of the text. We must not forget funding for my composer/lyricist, transportation for the equipment, actors, a choreographer, locations, craft services, permits for shooting on the streets of New York at night, someone to fine tune the sound mix of the film, as well as a colorist to add a splash of color to our upbeat, jazzy picture. Funding can make or break this film.</p>
<p>Of course me, and my team will be very happy with your donations, so we must reward you in some way! Check out some of the perks on the side of this page. If you donate enough money, I may even take you out for<i> the most important meal of the day,</i> breakfast. </p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>HEY YOU! If you don't know me, my name is Karly Ruesen and I am a fourth year student at York University. I am majoring in Film Production and just recently added a minor in Marketing under my belt. For my final film this year,  I want to create a music video that bridges contemporary art and technology as one. The song, ""It's Just You and Me"", was written and produced by fellow York students who are almost as excited as me to see their lyrics come to life!</p>
<p>The only problem is... money! And as students we barely have any! This music video requires some $$$ in order to bring it to its full potential. We need sets, sets that need wood, tools, plaster, paint, lights, and equipment. And then we need the cool stuff like a dolly, fog machines, smoke bombs, gels, costumes, chrome makeup (ouuu), and a projector. Then we need to feed people, a crew and cast of people, and if your Italian you especially know that doesn't come cheap! Along with transportation, a universal understanding that gas prices suck...

<p>My name is Daniel Tomlin, a senior at Liberty University, currently pursuing a B.S. in Cinematic Arts. This project is very important to me and is based on the pain and suffering I see the homeless and hurting veterans in our community. After getting the knowhow of how to make a shortfall, I decided to do something about that hurt I see so common. If you and I can cause more awareness for these people and get more people involved in these aspects of our community, we will see a huge increase in support and aid for these people who have done so much for us. By contributing to this project, you will help start a movement towards becoming a more compassionate people group for those who are most hurting.</p>
<p>I have budgeted about $2000 for the success of this project. This amounts for the cast and crew, most importantly the canine actor, food for the crew, locations, makeup, and wardrobe. The short film is pretty well contained, and shouldn't require anything over this amount, but this amount of money not only covers the funds required to even film the project, but also gives protection in case of an on-set emergency. Additionally, here is the best part, if we complete the project and have extra money leftover, every last bit of it will go to charities that support the homeless and veterans! By donating money, it is GUARANTEED to make a difference! </p>
<p>Like any film production, this is going to be a difficult challenge. Throughout the whole film making process, funding, and marketing, pulling this off is going to take a lot of work. I am confident, however, that we will succeed! As a Senior in the Cinematic Arts major at Liberty University, I am surrounded by wonderful peers and professors all willing to help and lend a hand to our efforts here. That, coupled with my passion for change and your contributions, there are no hurdle tall enough that we can't jump over!</p>
<p>If you can't contribute, please spread the word! Share this project to your friends or family, or perhaps to someone you know who went through these kind of experiences! Every little bit helps, whether that be spare change or a generous sum, its all going into the creation of something beautiful and constructive for our community. Additionally, sharing this project is easy with Indiegogo's share tools! With a click of a button, you can send this campaign to anyone you know on social media platforms, getting them involved as well.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hollywood, 1968. Jason Price, a struggling screenwriter whose agent is about to drop him unless he comes up with the next big moneymaker, is forced to move into a low-rent housing complex in West Hollywood. Here he discovers that Kay Gonda, a movie star from the early days of Hollywood, now in her late 60s and a recluse, lives across the hall. A chance meeting with this Greta Garbo-like actress intrigues the young writer, and they strike up an unlikely friendship. Despite growing closer to the actress, Price feels she isn’t telling him the whole story of her life or why she abandoned her career at the height of her popularity. Soon, he becomes obsessed with her story, and uncovers facts surrounding her having been accused of murdering an infamous tycoon, Granton Sayers. He also learns that, on the eve of the murder and on the run from the police, she visited six of her fans who had written her letters of undying devotion. As Price struggles to write his commercial movie script, he is plagued by Gonda’s story and begins to have dreams where parts of her life come to him as black and white scenes from a ‘30s movie. He imagines what might have happened to Gonda as she visited her fans at the time of the alleged murder, building to a climax that he cannot resolve until he learns the truth from the forgotten star on the eve of her death. Knowing Kay Gonda has given Price a newfound commitment that allows him to finish his screenplay. Will it be a success or another failure on his part to finally ""make it"" in Hollywood? More importantly, he has attempted to do justice to Gonda and to a heroine possessing integrity of the highest order.</p>
<div><h3>The Impact</h3></div>
<div>
<p><i>Gonda</i> is a much-needed antidote to today's predominant climate of personal and societal helplessness, the abject frustration and hopelessness that many of us feel when we watch the news and talk to friends and colleagues about the state of the world. In 1934, when Ayn Rand wrote her play, <i>Ideal</i>, she addressed some important issues that we still grapple with today: What is integrity? Is it important to be honest? Do the ends justify the means? What is success? Happiness? The meaning of life? These are the questions that she answered philosophically and dramatically in her non-fiction works and novels until her death in 1982. And, these are the same issues the characters in <i>Gonda</i> are confronted with, but in the turbulent era of the late 1960s. <i>Gonda: A Hollywood Story</i> will hopefully incite more conversation and analysis over these issues, and offer some clarity in today's complex world where so many have difficulty on a daily basis sorting through the challenges they are confronted with. And how, in the face of these things, pursuing our values with integrity is the only way to truly succeed in life.</p>
<h3>What's Needed &amp; What You'll Get</h3>
</div>
<p>Academy Award nominated filmmaker Michael Paxton's new feature film, <i>Gonda</i>, will incorporate archival scenes from Ayn Rand's 1934 play, <i>Ideal</i>. These scenes were originally adapted for film and shot in 1994 for Paxton's award-winning feature documentary, <i>Ayn Rand: A Sense of Life.</i>  A new “contemporary” story (taking place in the late ‘60s) will be shot in color, while all of the imaginary scenes (the previously shot scenes from <i>Ideal</i>) will be in black and white and interwoven into the same story. <i>Gonda</i> will create a unique opportunity to incorporate a contemporary spin on Ayn Rand's themes of integrity and honesty in a new feature film.</p>
<h3>Cast &amp; Crew</h3>
<p>It is a wonderful plus that the original actress who portrayed Kay Gonda in the World Premier theatrical version of <i>Ideal </i>(as well as the scenes adapted for film by Michael Paxton)--Janne Peters--will be reprising her role almost 25 years later. This coincides nicely with the fictitious passage of time for the character of the infamous actress in <i>Gonda</i>. The newly created characters of Jason Price (and two others) are still being cast. There are some wonderful actors who are interested in these roles, and they will be announced in the coming weeks when we officially sign them on to the project. This will also be true of the essential crew (Director of Photography, Production Designer, Musical Composer, etc.). Their names and experience in the film industry will also be shared when they come on board as the project progresses.  As of now, the following personnel are officially part of the cast and crew of <i>Gonda</i>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Executive Producer/Writer/Director: <strong>Michael Paxton</strong>
</li>
<li>Producer: <strong>Ellen Raphael</strong>
</li>
<li>Kay Gonda: <strong>Janne Peters</strong>
</li>
<li>Jason Price:<strong> Seamus Dever</strong>
</li>
<li>Sharon: <strong>Sharmila Devar</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Michael Paxton (Executive Producer/Writer/Director)</strong> has been in the film industry for over 30 years, working on a variety of live action, animated and stage productions along the way. He directed the world premier of Ayn Rand's play, <i>Ideal</i>, in 1989 at the Melrose Theater, and was the first filmmaker to write, produce and direct a documentary about the author in 1997. The film won an Oscar nomination in 1997 and a Golden Satellite Award for Best Documentary Feature in 1998 and it changed the landscape by exposing Ayn Rand's background and sense of life to the movie-going public. Since then, Michael has been shepherding feature film projects, educational videos and writing screenplays while teaching film production, production design and film history at the Art Institute - Hollywood. He is a member of the Actors Studio as well.​ His list of producing credits include, <i>Lion King 1 1/2 </i>for Disney<i>, Bionicle 3: Web of Shadows. </i>He also co-directed the short,<i><i> A Place in the Circle </i></i>with Pixote Hunt, was the Visual Effects Supervisor on <i>Stuart Little 2 </i> for Sony Imageworks<i> </i>and was the Assistant Director on <i>The Pagemaster </i>for Twentieth Century Fox<i>. <i>(<a href=""http://www.michaelpaxton.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://michaelpaxton.com/</a>)</i></i></p>
<p><strong>Ellen Raphael (Producer) </strong>came to film and television from an exciting background in theater as a Stage Manager on and off Broadway and in regional productions. She has worked with Directors such as Sir Peter Hall, Peter Sellars, Joseph Papp, Elia Kazan, Alan Schneider, Edwin Sherin Wole Soyinka and Vivian Matalon. Her television and film productions include Line Producing the Emmy and Peabody award-winning PBS series, <i>A Place of Our Own </i>and<i> Los Ninos En Su Casa</i>, the Academy Award-nominated Documentary, <i>Ayn Rand: A Sense of Life,</i> the Emmy Award-winning Public Television series, <i>California Connected, </i>and--with KCET--<i>Wired Science</i> , <i>Power in the Pacific</i> and <i>These Trying Times. </i>Ellen worked as Production Executive on the Disney Theme Park film: <i>Cinemagique</i> which married 64 films together with actors Martin Short, Julie Delpy and Alan Cumming.

<h3>The Plan</h3>
<p>To produce a quality feature film, a total budget of $600,000 will need to be raised. This will include pre-production, production, post production and distribution of the final film. If the total amount of funds are not raised, here's where the funds will go at the various levels of money raised (these are estimated figures):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>LEVEL 1</strong>: When $20,000 is raised, this will enable the digitization and preservation of the <i>Ideal</i> scenes which were shot in 1994 but never finished.</li>
<li>
<strong>LEVEL 2:</strong> When $125,000 is raised, this will enable the pre-production (completion of the script, casting, etc.) to be completed.</li>
<li>
<strong>LEVEL 3:</strong> When $475,000 is raised, the pre-production and production (shooting the film) can be completed.</li>
<li>
<strong>LEVEL 4:</strong> When $600,000 (the entire budget) is raised, the film can finally go into post-production and be distributed.</li>
</ul>

Hollywood, 1968. Jason Price, a struggling screenwriter whose agent is about to drop him unless he comes up with the next big moneymaker, is forced to move into a low-rent housing complex in West Hollywood. Here he discovers that Kay Gonda, a movie star from the early days of Hollywood, now in her late 60s and a recluse, lives across the hall. A chance meeting with this Greta Garbo-like actress intrigues the young writer, and they strike up an unlikely friendship. Despite growing closer to the actress, Price feels she isn’t telling him the whole story of her life or why she abandoned her career at the height of her popularity. Soon, he becomes obsessed with her story, and uncovers facts surrounding her having been accused of murdering an infamous tycoon, Granton Sayers. He also learns that, on the eve of the murder and on the run from the police, she visited six of her fans who had written her letters of undying devotion. As Price struggles to write his commercial movie script, he is plagued by Gonda’s story and begins to have dreams where parts of her life come to him as black and white scenes from a ‘30s movie. He imagines what might have happened to Gonda as she visited her fans at the time of the alleged murder, building to a climax that he cannot resolve until he learns the truth from the forgotten star on the eve of her death. Knowing Kay Gonda has given Price a newfound commitment that allows him to finish his screenplay. Will it be a success or another failure on his part to finally ""make it"" in Hollywood? More importantly, he has attempted to do justice to Gonda and to a heroine possessing integrity of the highest order.
The Impact

Gonda is a much-needed antidote to today's predominant climate of personal and societal helplessness, the abject frustration and hopelessness that many of us feel when we watch the news and talk to friends and colleagues about the state of the world. In 1934, when Ayn Rand wrote her play, Ideal, she addressed some important issues that we still grapple with today: What is integrity? Is it important to be honest? Do the ends justify the means? What is success? Happiness? The meaning of life? These are the questions that she answered philosophically and dramatically in her non-fiction works and novels until her death in 1982. And, these are the same issues the characters in Gonda are confronted with, but in the turbulent era of the late 1960s. Gonda: A Hollywood Story will hopefully incite more conversation and analysis over these issues, and offer some clarity in today's complex world where so many have difficulty on a daily basis sorting through the challenges they are confronted with. And how, in the face of these things, pursuing our values with integrity is the only way to truly succeed in life.
What's Needed & What You'll Get

Academy Award nominated filmmaker Michael Paxton's new feature film, Gonda, will incorporate archival scenes from Ayn Rand's 1934 play, Ideal. These scenes were originally adapted for film and shot in 1994 for Paxton's award-winning feature documentary, Ayn Rand: A Sense of Life.  A new “contemporary” story (taking place in the late ‘60s) will be shot in color, while all of the imaginary scenes (the previously shot scenes from Ideal) will be in black and white and interwoven into the same story. Gonda will create a unique opportunity to incorporate a contemporary spin on Ayn Rand's themes of integrity and honesty in a new feature film.
Cast & Crew
It is a wonderful plus that the original actress who portrayed Kay Gonda in the World Premier theatrical version of Ideal (as well as the scenes adapted for film by Michael Paxton)--Janne Peters--will be reprising her role almost 25 years later. This coincides nicely with the fictitious passage of time for the character of the infamous actress in Gonda. The newly created characters of Jason Price (and two others) are still being cast. There are some wonderful actors who are interested in these roles, and they will be announced in the coming weeks when we officially sign them on to the project. This will also be true of the essential crew (Director of Photography, Production Designer, Musical Composer, etc.). Their names and experience in the film industry will also be shared when they come on board as the project progresses.  As of now, the following personnel are officially part of the cast and crew of Gonda:

Executive Producer/Writer/Director: Michael Paxton

Producer: Ellen Raphael

Kay Gonda: Janne Peters

Jason Price: Seamus Dever

Sharon: Sharmila Devar

The film won an Oscar nomination in 1997 and a Golden Satellite Award for Best Documentary Feature in 1998 and it changed the landscape by exposing Ayn Rand's background and sense of life to the movie-going public. Since then, Michael has been shepherding feature film projects, educational videos and writing screenplays while teaching film production, production design and film history at the Art Institute - Hollywood. He is a member of the Actors Studio as well.​ His list of producing credits include, Lion King 1 1/2 for Disney, Bionicle 3: Web of Shadows.

</div></div>","If you actually have time to read this, I'm impressed.It has been said that life gives you the test, then the lesson. This is to fund the feature intelligent film ""Answers"". A film that will give clueless people the lesson first. You can provide as little as $1,Here is the script. We're letting you see it to be fair. If you're using a phone, you may have to download a pdf reader. We don't think you'll agree with everything, but we hope you will like enough.The rest of this is for any questions you might have and includes screen tests of other cast. The cast will memorize a few pages at a time.There is no conflict in the story because it will be in the audience.The video is a little different from the script because we don't want to risk offending cream puffs. The feature will stick to the script.Many people are going to be concerned about the scenes from other movies and licensing. I cite fair use. Worst case they just won't go in.None of the video will be in the feature. If this gets funded, we're doing those parts again and better.Business is a woman in the trailer and a man in the script because in my opinion that character, and Politics, can be either gender. The actor who played Politics, Odell Crayton, will be in the feature.There are many smart men who are dumb with women. That's why. Watch the intro to Idiocracy.
Let's make this a real team effort. We are willing to consider changes to the script depending on how much sense your suggestion makes, if you have one.

A small group of dedicated people want to change the world.

J King is Associate Producer due to his connections. He might also be cast, depending on auditions. I'm picky.

Julie Kida will play the title role. She has connections too. Permission to use photo by Johnny Quattlebaum. And yes I agree that she could play a live action Little Mermaid.
Lisa DeLeon plays the Girlfriend.
Screen tests for other characters:
J King referred 

The models are there to add scenery to the substance. We are not depending on their looks to make it work, but people will be looking at it.
Mohammad Ahmed will be the Muslim. It's hard to find a Muslim actor. Please respect I could cast a hispanic to be the Muslim. I just want to keep it real.


Mohammad's IMDB
The incomplete cast is partly because it is not a paying gig yet.  Put money into this and you will get updates.
Locations
We only have one location set up, but it's the hard one to get. This pub will serve as the restaurant. But that makes sense anyway due to the intelligent discussions that happen at pubs.
 


More Perks
Life will begin... to get better for everyone.
Keep the receipt of your donation. Having something to do with this could help you in the future, like with a date or job interview.
In reference to the script perk, I am not expecting to raise funds for it because it would cost so much, especially to do it... justice. I estimate minimum 25 million.
If this actually gets 25m, both get produced.
Distribution
We'll do it online first for donors, then go from there.

<h3>The Last Independent Bookstore in Bloomsburg...</h3> <p>The Cloak and Dragon Bookstore has seen it all: theft, vandalism, bad economies...even a brief tangle with that most terrible enemy of all, fire. It has survived for 18 years at the heart of Bloomsburg, linking generations through the wild and tumultuous beauty of the English language (and several others besides!) across half a hundred genres and subgenres, and through the singular and irreplaceable delight of browsing, unfettered by sidebars and pop-ups, in the atmosphere of exploration and discovery that is the hallmark of bookstores the world over.</p>
<p>Now it stands at the brink of extinction.</p>
<p>A bookstore is more than a business. It's a place of culture, a place to learn, a place to find joy in both memory and anticipation of the future. We have done our best to expand upon that tradition with locally-made luxuries of all kinds, in addition to our reading stock, and we have every confidence that the Cloak and Dragon has what it takes to flourish. So what's stopping us?</p>
<p>Time.</p>
<p>Put simply, we are an independent bookstore with a staff of three, all of whom are now facing expansions in the traditions of their personal lives - expansions that offer new opportunities but also meet a marked shortage of hours available, and in fact, by autumn, it will be impossible to maintain our regular schedule. Unfortunately, our profits are not such that we can cut out most of the week and still expect to manage all of our bills. The necessity now is to sell, but sale is a delicate proposition, involving a period of search and courtship, and if we can't sell - well, there's nothing for it. We'll disappear, and there will be one less light on Main Street at night. We don't want that. We don't want what it will mean to Bloomsburg. We don't want to see our legacy die.</p>
<p>So we come, humbly, to you.</p>
<p>Our goal is simple. Keep the bookstore open - keep us breathing. We need time, more than anything else, to find a worthy heir to continue on the Cloak and Dragon's lineage, and that's all we're looking to achieve. </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need From You</h3> <ul> <li>We need least $18,000 to cover continued operational costs over the next five months - these include our rent to the Philipps Emporium, the cost of book and coffee shipments, and bills for our wi-fi, our phone and merchant services, our refreshment offerings, and assorted store supplies. Our goal is to remain open through Christmas for several days a week, to be with our community for at least one more holiday season. There's no limit to our commitment in this regard; if we exceed our campaign goal, we'll keep going as long as we can at whatever hours we can manage.</li>
<li>Our ultimate purpose - our best-case scenario - is to attract a buyer willing to carry on our legacy. Bloomsburg needs a bookstore, and the benefits a bookstore offers are truly timeless. We have absolute faith in the literate community of our town, but a marked shortage of TIME - with love and enthusiasm, we think the Cloak and Dragon, and Bloomsburg, are ready for a revival that'll send shockwaves right through Main Street. We want to see that dream come true. We hope that this campaign will communicate our faith in it, and showcase exactly how much Bloomsburg wants to see our legacy survive.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>

The Last Independent Bookstore in Bloomsburg... The Cloak and Dragon Bookstore has seen it all: theft, vandalism, bad economies...even a brief tangle with that most terrible enemy of all, fire.

Now it stands at the brink of extinction.
A bookstore is more than a business. It's a place of culture, a place to learn, a place to find joy in both memory and anticipation of the future.

<p> With the help of Indiegogo we are going to fully launch Snap It in the UK and increase the awareness of the Consumer Repair Kit.  Our key challenge is no one has heard of the Snap It brand and does not know the benefits our our revolutionary product.</p>
<p><b>Where will the money be spent?</b></p>
<p>A) Buying Stock</p>
<p>The first thing the money will be spent on is acquiring our first shipment of SnapIt repair kits in the UK.  SnapIt is a new product in Europe so we are hoping after we get the inventory purchased we can expand into retail stores all across Europe. With the help of Kickstarter and your investment we know that we can make SnapIt a household name available at retail stores all over Europe.  </p>
<p>B) Marketing/PR</p>
<p>We will try to obtain as much 'free' PR as possible and are currently sending information to a lot of online bloggers and mainstream media writers.  That said, we do need to spend some money hence why we are on IndieGoGo.  </p>
<p>The majority of the money will therefore be used to run a cost effective marketing campaign through social media and Google Ads; our product lends itself to being demonstrated so we think this strategy could work well.  This will involve creating a short online viral video as well as a creative advert for offline media spend.  There is obviously then the actual marketing spend to get the viral video and other adverts out there.</p>
<p>C) Trade Shows</p>
<p>We will also use some of the money to attend a couple of key trade shows to get the product out to potential retail customers. </p>

In 2014, the City of Philadelphia officially recognized “N3rd Street” as a growing corridor of Philly’s thriving collaborative, creative, startup, and technology community. N3rd Street is a melting pot of industries and interests, including but not limited to design nerds, art nerds, fashion nerds, technology nerds, startup nerds, food nerds, sustainability nerds, science nerds, game nerds, history nerds, and a whole lot more. 
The official naming ceremony took place in Liberty Lands Park. Since then, we’ve seen the N3rd Street community continue to grow with N3rd Street Farmers Market, N3rd Street Gamers, N3rd Street Prom, and more. 


This year, we celebrate the 1-year birthday party of N3rd Street, in the place of its birth, Liberty Lands Park. The event will take place on a First Friday and will include interactive & informational booths from Philly-based startups and tech companies, games, live entertainment, and local drinks and food! Additionally, due to the efforts of Bamboo Wifi & Jarvus Innovations, Liberty Lands Park will be enabled with free Wifi, the first install of the N3rd Street Wifi Network.
   Our Goals
1) To celebrate N3rd Street, the local businesses, and highlight companies doing great things in our community!
2) Fundraising for N3rd Street initiatives: 
 • To create micro-grants for Code for Philly developers to build software tools to improve N3rd Street and Philadelphia as a whole
 • To build a free “N3rd Street Wifi Network” with Bamboo Wifi
 • To support local community centers, parks departments and cleaning efforts, and after-school programs
 • To support local schools and neighborhood associations to involve kids in projects with the tech, music, and artist community
3) To spread national awareness of the City of Philadelphia’s support of entrepreneurs and the strength of our technology community

<h2>Introduction </h2>
<p><i>The Tall</i>, Directed by Max Hardyk, is about a man, David, who struggles to survive in a world dominated by tall, enigmatic beings, and tries to hold on to his own sanity and moral values. </p>
<p>This is a story about what it truly means to be human and at what lengths would one go through to survive?</p>
</div><div>
<h2>The Story</h2>
<p>Our story takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where monstrous giants now wander and decimate the land. David, a mere survivor of it all, walks a lone gravel road with a pack of supplies and a gun for protection. These days everything is a threat.  </p>
<p>The life he had before was everything, now he has nothing. Haunted by his past, it's the only thing keeping him sane. Pieces of his past form together as David goes on his journey, seeing what his life was like before and how he got here in the present. </p>
<p>As David walks down this gravel road, he comes across an abandoned vehicle. With slight hope, he goes over and searches for supplies. As he walks to the driver's side, he then sees a stranger sitting in the driver's seat. They both quickly pull up their weapons, aiming at each other, but neither shoots.</p>
<p>David grips his rifle nervously and shifts his mouth, unsure if he'll be able to shoot if necessary. After a moment, he notices the stranger is holding his side. He was injured. David is now faced with a choice to kill this man, or to help him. </p>
<p>This choice spirals into a mad journey of what it truly means to be human and just how much is one willing to do to survive?</p>

<p>There are a lot of risks and challenges that come with this project. Black Medallion Productions is very new and is still taking off. As filmmakers, we want to tackle these challenges together and make our project reality. One of our biggest challenges is making this film look realistic. We want realistic props, costumes, and VFX. Those three words alone are already expensive. With proper funding, we can make this project have the look we want.</p>
<p>This project will require a lot of time and resources and the only thing holding us back is lack of funding. Help would be greatly appreciated.

The Story
Our story takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where monstrous giants now wander and decimate the land. David, a mere survivor of it all, walks a lone gravel road with a pack of supplies and a gun for protection. These days everything is a threat.  
The life he had before was everything, now he has nothing. Haunted by his past, it's the only thing keeping him sane. Pieces of his past form together as David goes on his journey, seeing what his life was like before and how he got here in the present. 
As David walks down this gravel road, he comes across an abandoned vehicle. With slight hope, he goes over and searches for supplies. As he walks to the driver's side, he then sees a stranger sitting in the driver's seat. They both quickly pull up their weapons, aiming at each other, but neither shoots.

It explores how different people view relationships and how this is molded by their past experiences. How a need for control and manipulation leads to self destructive tendencies. </p><p>Sam is the new kid in school. He struggles making friends but desperately wants the typical high school posse that everyone else seems to have. One day he meets Andie, a stoic and mysterious girl who gives Sam the friendship he greatly wants. Andie’s controlling nature leads her down a path of manipulation with Sam as an easy target.  </p><h2>Why This Film?</h2><p>My name is Jacob Schermerhorn, I am currently a senior at the University of Kansas and <i>This is Control</i>  will be my final Capstone project for the film program. This story has been something I had been planning since I started studying film at KU. It deals with ideas and themes that I enjoy exploring and have experienced in my friendships and relationships. I want to be able to display the complexities of friendships and relationships, a topic that has always fascinated me. </p><p>A majority of the film will be shot in my hometown of Wamego, Kansas. This is a detail I knew I wanted to include since the idea came about. I want to replicate the visual experience I had growing up in a midwestern small town. A setting that feels so small and contained when growing up. </p><p>“Coming of Age” films have always been some of my favorites. No matter the audience, these films are able to connect with the viewer. Everyone has once been a naive teen, where relationships (platonic and not) are the most important aspect of everyday life.</p><p>Filmmaking has always been a passion of mine. I grew up making videos with my family’s old camcorder and the toys I had around me. Once I entered high school, I started making shorts with my friends.

It explores how different people view relationships and how this is molded by their past experiences. How a need for control and manipulation leads to self destructive tendencies. Sam is the new kid in school. He struggles making friends but desperately wants the typical high school posse that everyone else seems to have. One day he meets Andie, a stoic and mysterious girl who gives Sam the friendship he greatly wants. Andie’s controlling nature leads her down a path of manipulation with Sam as an easy target.  Why This Film?My name is Jacob Schermerhorn, I am currently a senior at the University of Kansas and This is Control  will be my final Capstone project for the film program. This story has been something I had been planning since I started studying film at KU. It deals with ideas and themes that I enjoy exploring and have experienced in my friendships and relationships. I want to be able to display the complexities of friendships and relationships, a topic that has always fascinated me. A majority of the film will be shot in my hometown of Wamego, Kansas. This is a detail I knew I wanted to include since the idea came about. I want to replicate the visual experience I had growing up in a midwestern small town. A setting that feels so small and contained when growing up. “Coming of Age” films have always been some of my favorites. No matter the audience, these films are able to connect with the viewer. Everyone has once been a naive teen, where relationships (platonic and not) are the most important aspect of everyday life.Filmmaking has always been a passion of mine. I grew up making videos with my family’s old camcorder and the toys I had around me. Once I entered high school, I started making shorts with my friends. College has shown me my passion for cinematography and having my hands on the camera. This film will be my first short film directorial debut, which my four years of film school has prepared me for. I wanted to wait to direct a film that I had a personal connection with and I could make my own.

<h3>Say what?!? A DOGSLEDDING DOCUMENTARY!?!?</h3>
<p>Dogsledding is more than just a sport, it's a bond that lasts a lifetime! If you're a dog lover, THIS film is for YOU!!</p>
<p>My name is Robert Michael and I'm thrilled to be creating the documentary, <i>Heartprints in the Snow! </i>Join me as I venture back to where it all started for me, Michigan, as I explore the <u>bonds</u> that are built between humankind and canine, and experience the love and connection behind the sport as seen in Hollywood films such as Togo, 8 Below, Snow Dogs, and so many more! With stories out of Michigan, Texas, New York, and more!</p>
<p>I grew up within the <strong>MUSH</strong> organization, AKA <i>Mid Union Sled Haulers</i> from 1996-2009. My father was the president of the organization for a period of time and my mother on the board herself. In 2004 my father co founded <strong>MIDD</strong>, AKA <i>Michigan Dog Drivers Association</i> with Rick and Linda Lange, and both clubs are currently thriving! I'll be focusing on these groups and the mushers who's lives have been changed forever by their furry family members! </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>QUALIFICATIONS!</strong></h2>
<p>My production company, GEEPAK Entertainment, produced <i>""By the Grace of God""</i> with <strong>6 wins</strong> and <strong>7 nominations</strong> at festivals worldwide. We also produced <i>""Modern American Nightmare""</i> with <strong>3 wins</strong> and <strong>5 nominations</strong>! In television, we produced the soundtracks for the <u>REELZ Network</u> originals <i>""Titanic: Sinking the Myths""</i> and <i>""The Zodiac Killer Trap"" </i></p>

<h3>What We Need To Bring You an AMAZING film!</h3>
<p>For a full list of incentives to funding, see the ""perks"" section!</p>
<p>For this film to be of impact, there are certain things we need to raise funding for. First and foremost,</p>
<p><strong>TRAVEL -</strong> Living in Los Angeles, I need to venture back to Michigan to conduct interviews and highlight the MUSH and MIDD organizations, as well as the mushers that live out there. This will take a good chunk of money, and my ability to conduct specific number of interviews will rely HEAVILY on the amount of money I can raise, including an option to do some business in Alaska!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>CREW </strong>- Though minimal, I will require at least one crew member to travel with me and run camera and sound operations</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>INTERVIEWS -</strong> I need to pay my interviewees! </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>POST PRODUCTION/EQUIPTMENT -</strong> I will require a camera rental and post production services. Nothing lavish, but high quality 4K content requires 4K camera! I want my interviewees to look their best!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>FESTIVALS - </strong>I'm not planning a huge festival run, but submission fees to the BIG festivals with big audiences require a good amount of money</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This film will highlight the bond between mushers and their animals, and those who might be a little skeptical of the sport will watch the film with a new understanding about the respect, love, and care that mushers in the state of Michigan have for their teammates. Mushers and dogs run together, not as master and obeyer, but as a pack - all working for the same goal and building a lifelong relationship in the process.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong>Earl Biss, The Spirit Who Walks Among His People</strong> is a documentary that sheds light on this ground breaking, dynamic, mystical, and controversial Crow artist.</p>
<p>EARL BISS was a catalyst during the golden era when a group of young Native artists came through the Institute of American Indian Art and transformed Native art from primitive, stylized forms to fine art. This miracle generation contributed to the explosion of Contemporary Southwest Art that began in the 1960s. Considered the lead Native American painter of this movement by many critics, Biss was recognized by one Southwest art critic and collector as the greatest colorist of the 20th Century.</p>
<p>Influenced by European masters, yet forging an evolving style all his own, Biss drew upon his rich heritage of the Crow Indians – the Apsáalooke – as a primary force shaping his art. At the heart of his work was always his love of the Apsáalooke, which shone through his art like a beacon of light bursting through a storm.</p>
<p>The film showcases masterful art while giving deep insight into the man that created it. Rare archival footage of Biss speaking and painting, and interviews with tribal members, friends, art dealers, and patrons paint an unforgettable story – a joyous, dynamic, tumultuous journey to success in the art world.</p>
<p>The documentary is directed and produced by Lisa Gerstner, the author of the biography <i>Experiences with Earl Biss - The Spirit Who Walks Among His People. </i>Earl Biss had asked Lisa to write his biography. They worked together on his story in 1994-1995. And now the movie will bring further understanding of his life and art.</p>
<p><strong>Your contributions and support will bring to light Earl Biss' well deserved place in Art History. </strong></p>

<p>Riding below Pryor Gap with Dogs, giclee, 24 x 30 in</p>
<p><strong>A canvas Giclee is a fine art reproduction using a high-quality inkjet printer to make individual copies.</strong> The term giclee originated in the early 1990s by a print maker whose aim was to distinguish the higher quality prints he was making from the negatively perceived term ""inkjet."" However, giclee printing is ink-jet printing. In fact, the word giclee is derived from the French word ""gicler"" which means to squirt or spray – as inkjet printers spray ink onto canvas. Over time, the usage of the word has evolved to be a catch all term for quality and best printing practices. Archival inks are designed to resist fading and the chemical composition allows the ink to hold fast to the printed surface. Simply put, a giclee is a well made canvas print that will last a long time.</p>

<p><strong>A Serigraph is a silk screened image.</strong> Biss serigraphs are limited editions, each one involving the artist's hand. Earl Biss hand drew color separations on Mylar. Each serigraph involved 60 to 80 screens. A separate silk screen was created for each and every color and was washed out after use. Each screen was precisely placed over high quality serigraph paper, and then by hand squeegee, paint for a specific color was applied. This single application of one paint color had to dry for at least 24 to 48 hours before the next color paint could be applied. It can take a serographer up to 6 months to produce a run of as many as 300 serigraphs of the same image. </p>
<p>Earl Biss was a purist when it came to reproducing his work. He was a master lithographer earlier in his career and he was a master at serigraphs. His hand was in every step, and every color printed was approved by him in person. The colors of the serigraphs had to match the original paintings as closely as possible.</p>

I believe in magic. In fact, I live magic. It's the only way to be . . . that is real.
                                          ~ Earl Biss
 
Short Summary
Earl Biss, The Spirit Who Walks Among His People is a documentary that sheds light on this ground breaking, dynamic, mystical, and controversial Crow artist.
EARL BISS was a catalyst during the golden era when a group of young Native artists came through the Institute of American Indian Art and transformed Native art from primitive, stylized forms to fine art. This miracle generation contributed to the explosion of Contemporary Southwest Art that began in the 1960s. Considered the lead Native American painter of this movement by many critics, Biss was recognized by one Southwest art critic and collector as the greatest colorist of the 20th Century.
Influenced by European masters, yet forging an evolving style all his own, Biss drew upon his rich heritage of the Crow Indians – the Apsáalooke – as a primary force shaping his art. At the heart of his work was always his love of the Apsáalooke, which shone through his art like a beacon of light bursting through a storm.
The film showcases masterful art while giving deep insight into the man that created it. Rare archival footage of Biss speaking and painting, and interviews with tribal members, friends, art dealers, and patrons paint an unforgettable story – a joyous, dynamic, tumultuous journey to success in the art world.
The documentary is directed and produced by Lisa Gerstner, the author of the biography Experiences with Earl Biss - The Spirit Who Walks Among His People. Earl Biss had asked Lisa to write his biography. They worked together on his story in 1994-1995. And now the movie will bring further understanding of his life and art.
Your contributions and support will bring to light Earl Biss' well deserved place in Art History.

A canvas Giclee is a fine art reproduction using a high-quality inkjet printer to make individual copies. The term giclee originated in the early 1990s by a print maker whose aim was to distinguish the higher quality prints he was making from the negatively perceived term ""inkjet."" However, giclee printing is ink-jet printing. In fact, the word giclee is derived from the French word ""gicler"" which means to squirt or spray – as inkjet printers spray ink onto canvas. Over time, the usage of the word has evolved to be a catch all term for quality and best printing practices. Archival inks are designed to resist fading and the chemical composition allows the ink to hold fast to the printed surface. Simply put, a giclee is a well made canvas print that will last a long time.

They Stood Like the Glory of The Sun, 35 x 45 in
$4200 value


A Serigraph is a silk screened image. Biss serigraphs are limited editions, each one involving the artist's hand. Earl Biss hand drew color separations on Mylar. Each serigraph involved 60 to 80 screens. A separate silk screen was created for each and every color and was washed out after use. Each screen was precisely placed over high quality serigraph paper, and then by hand squeegee, paint for a specific color was applied. This single application of one paint color had to dry for at least 24 to 48 hours before the next color paint could be applied. It can take a serographer up to 6 months to produce a run of as many as 300 serigraphs of the same image. 
Earl Biss was a purist when it came to reproducing his work. He was a master lithographer earlier in his career and he was a master at serigraphs. His hand was in every step, and every color printed was approved by him in person. The colors of the serigraphs had to match the original paintings as closely as possible.

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p><i>Marram</i> tells the story of a family on a Scottish Hebridean island. While they are going to great lengths to understand and revive a beloved son, the marram grass they need to thatch the roof over their heads recedes from a gradually eroding coastline.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Who we are...</h3>
<p>Hello! We are writer Elspeth Turner and DOP Robbie Jones, and together we're directing <i>Marram</i>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What we're doing...</h3>
<p>We began collaborating on this idea several years ago, and this year we are really delighted to be moving this film into production. We have secured our dream cast of actors, gathered together an incredible crew, and teamed up with the incredible producers at RPP Productions. We are planning a one week shoot on the Scottish Hebridean island of Berneray, Harris, this winter. Because the film revolves around a family who are cutting and gathering marram, we are committed to shooting in November, when the marram is being cut in the community. We are raising money to support us in the production of this film.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Writer's Statement</h3>
<p>The idea of making a film on Berneray occurred to me in November 2015. My father is from the island, and I was there with my brothers, gathering marram grass out on the West side, for thatching the roof of our family cottage there. I was especially intrigued by the sounds I was hearing whilst doing this work - which is sometimes quite meditative. I grew up spending summers on the island, and so I have always been in awe of the beauty of the landscape. However, I wasn’t prepared for the beguiling quality of the light, wildlife, and the land itself, which can be seen in the winter months, and I thought: I think this place will always be unravelling itself to me. So it occurred to me to make a film which might communicate this majestic and in some ways unknowable place to other people.</p>
<p>The characters then grew out of my love for and fascination with the place, and I knew I wanted to follow a family who were working with the marram – I think it’s interesting to watch modern characters carry out this very old practice. This is particularly interesting and important to explore these days, as coastal erosion and other environmental pressures mean that some areas of marram grass which must have once seemed plentiful, are now under threat.</p>
<p>I always wanted the story to be a modern story, complete with some very old beliefs, and to be told in Gaelic. It is very important to me that Gaelic be recognized as a living language, and therefore it’s important for me, as an artist, to show it as such. Therefore I hope we can make the film in such a way that the characters speaking Gaelic is not a big deal, but a matter of course.</p>
<p>I have done some writing for screen before, but this is my first venture as a director of film. I am running towards the opportunity with lots of excitement, partly because I’ll have the chance finally to collaborate with DOP Robbie Jones, who will co-direct. Robbie and I got to know each other working on the feature film Riptide – a schizophrenia love story. I saw first hand just how endlessly inventive and determined Robbie can be as a DOP, and I can’t wait to work with him in capturing the landscape in the Outer Hebrides, and in finding the most interesting and beautiful ways to turn this script into a film.</p>

This is particularly interesting and important to explore these days, as coastal erosion and other environmental pressures mean that some areas of marram grass which must have once seemed plentiful, are now under threat.
I always wanted the story to be a modern story, complete with some very old beliefs, and to be told in Gaelic. It is very important to me that Gaelic be recognized as a living language, and therefore it’s important for me, as an artist, to show it as such. Therefore I hope we can make the film in such a way that the characters speaking Gaelic is not a big deal, but a matter of course.
I have done some writing for screen before, but this is my first venture as a director of film. I am running towards the opportunity with lots of excitement, partly because I’ll have the chance finally to collaborate with DOP Robbie Jones, who will co-direct. Robbie and I got to know each other working on the feature film Riptide – a schizophrenia love story. I saw first hand just how endlessly inventive and determined Robbie can be as a DOP, and I can’t wait to work with him in capturing the landscape in the Outer Hebrides, and in finding the most interesting and beautiful ways to turn this script into a film.

What We Need 
We are currently raising money to cover the cost of shooting the film. Between us all, we own or can borrow certain items, so the figures below are based on what we will need to cover the remainder of necessities.
This does not include a budget for post production or festival submissions.
 
EQUIPMENT RENTAL - £1000
 
PRODUCTION COSTS - £200
Props/wardrobe: £100
Flashdrives (for footage): £100
 
TRAVEL, FOOD & ACCOMMODATION - £2000
Accommodation: £900
Fuel and ferry tickets: £600
Food: £500
These numbers are calculated based on the needs of catering for 13 people for the duration of the 4-day shoot.  Some of the accommodation is being generously donated to us.
 
ARTIST/CREW FEES - £2500
This amount allows us to pay the cast and crew for their work. With a team of 13, this was always going to be the largest portion of our budget. We are immensely grateful to have such a gifted team and believe their skills are worth paying for. 
 
INSURANCE - £300
 
TOTAL TARGET : £6000
 
If we do not reach our entire goal, but we raise enough to survive the shoot (basics only), we will proceed with filming if at all possible, as the content is so time-specific to November.

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p><i><strong>Letters to Eloisa</strong>  </i>is a documentary film on Cuban writer <strong>José Lezama Lima</strong>, legendary poet and writer, considered one of most influential figures in Latin American literature in the twentieth century.    Lezama's life story is told through letters written to his sister living in exile, between 1961 and 1976. </p>
<p>The film is a first-hand look at the transformative impact of politics on the family and society; and shows the struggle between Cuba’s revolutionary government and artists and intellectuals, as the space for creative freedom disappeared in Cuba during the first two decades of the revolution.   <strong><i>Letters to Eloisa  </i></strong>is a window into a human soul crushed by repression and intolerance.</p>
<p>We have completed production of this film and have put together a 62-minute rough cut but we need funds to cover some post production expenses including: </p>

<p>""Stories reveal themselves in very unusual ways.  While finishing up a documentary on Fidel Castro for PBS’s American Experience, I “discovered” a remarkable body of correspondence written by Cuban writer <strong>José Lezama Lima</strong> between 1961 to 1976 to his sister living in exile.  I was immediately driven to tell the dramatic life story of this seminal literary giant, and embarked on a decade-long journey. ""  (<i>Adriana Bosch</i>)</p>
<p><strong>José Lezama Lima</strong> is considered one of Cuba’s greatest 20<sup>th</sup> century writers and poets.  Beginning with his first poem ""Muerte de Narciso"" in 1937,  based on the Greek Myth, Lezama elevated Cuban literature by adding a timeless, universal dimension to literature.   He founded a cultural group around a journal Orígenes that was read in every corner of the Spanish speaking world.  Lezama's  work influenced succeeding generations of writers and contributed to the Mid-Century literary explosion known as The Latin American Boom.  During this period, novelists Alejo Carpentier, Gabriel García Márquez, Carlos Fuentes, Julio Cortázar, Mario Vargas Llosa created a dazzling and inventive Latin American literature which transformed the novel for all time.   But unlike the others who enjoyed the limelight and achieved immortalized status, <strong>Lezama Lima </strong>lived his final years ostracized, silenced and alone.  </p>
<p>The revealing letters Lezama writes to his sister Eloisa weave together the public and the private, the literary and the political, and tell how the writer’s voice, at first amplified by the revolution’s emphasis on culture, was ultimately silenced as the Cuban Revolution narrowed the sphere of cultural and intellectual freedom in Cuba.</p>
<p>The story begins with the publication of Lezama's emblematic work <i>Paradiso, </i> a semi autobiographical and poetic, was hailed as a literary masterpiece and created a sensation in literary circles across Latin America and Europe.  It also included a surprisingly homoerotic ""Chapter 8"" which brought Lezama into conflict with Cuba's contemporaneous campaign against homosexuals which included sending homosexuals and suspected homosexuals to concentration camps and removing them from any position of cultural influence, including teaching, writing, or participating in public performances.</p>
<p>The film narrates Lezama's confrontation with the Castro regime in the late 1960s as well as his state imposed ostracism that lasted through his death in 1976.  It includes the crackdown on intellectual freedom following the famous Padilla Affair,  when Cuban poet Heberto Padilla was jailed after publishing poetry deemed ""anti-revolutionary.""  At his ""trial"", Padilla performed a public act of self-recrimination, naming other artists and writers as fellow counterrevolutionaries, among them,  José Lezama Lima. </p>
<p>Once regarded as Cuba’s most important intellectual, Lezama was never again published in Cuba and saw his books removed from libraries and bookstores.  Visitors to his home became politically suspect.  Censored, ostracized and forbidden to travel outside the island at a time when his novel was garnering worldwide acclaim, Lezama Lima faded into obscurity within the walls of his Havana home.   His obituary, a short column hidden on page 3 of the official newspaper <i>Granma</i>, simply read ""<i>una sensible pérdida</i>"" - a regretful loss. </p>

<h3>Story Summary</h3>
<p><i><font>Any Which Way </font></i><font>is a new coming of age story about the trials of post graduate friendship in the 21st Century.  Our story follows AJ and Parker, two college best friends now living in the real world and struggling to make ends meet.  Parker values success above all else, and an image of wealth and maturity is what he values most in life.  AJ on the other hand is a musician and idealistic to a fault.  He doesn't care about financial success and views accepting any job unrelated to his dream of becoming a successful musician as failure.   The character's values start to stress the once solid foundation of their friendship.  So when AJ meets a confident young actress working at his local coffee shop and Parker's job becomes more stressful than he could have imagined, both learn what it means to pursue their dreams while dealing with the responsibility of adult life, and how that affects a friendship they once thought to be unbreakable.  </font></p>

ALL AT THE SAME TIME!  If anyone can help make RED LIGHT a success, its a  guy who can do all of that!  Go get 'em, John!                                      

We can't make our film without you.  Maybe you need more perks to go along with your contribution!



We want you to see every dime on the screen.  From great visual effects to awesome Dolby surround sound, we want you to hear and feel a great experience when watching the finished Red Light film.
Here's how we plan to allocate the funds raised through our Indiegogo campaign.


...so graciously, through you, we raise the money to bring RED LIGHT to the big screen...





John (Johnny G) Garrett has worked on many blockbuster films such as ""Man Of Steel"", ""Captain America"", ""The Borne Legacy"" and Will Smith's ""Hancock"" to name a few.  He was honored by the International Cinematographers Guild as an EMERGING CINEMATOGRAPHER in 2015.  In 2010, John was honored with the BEST CINEMATOGRAPHER award for the short film ""Collector"".  He shared this honor with another incredible cinematographer Thomas Scott Stanton.   John's incredible talent would again be showcased in the short film ""The Art of Human Salvage"" starring Edward James Olmos.

John went on to be the cinematographer for the upcoming film ""Sugar Mountain"", starring Game of Thrones star Jason Momoa.   ""Johnny G"" is going to make Red Light look incredible!




We want to have the best cast possible and it all starts with you!
With your help, we'll make offers to these actors to star in Red Light!



We are making a movie inspired by one man's true experiences.   Although it is inspired by this man's video of his extraterrestrial experience, it is still a movie that is meant to inform, inspire, and entertain.  We have dramatized his story in a captivating and exciting way.  Red Light will be similar to these films...

RED LIGHT is unique when compared to these films,  We have an actual video of alien abduction to support our story.  We aren't only creating a film, but sharing this phenomenon with the world!
You can be a part of this, too!



Use Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, Tumblr, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, SnapChat... to get the word out about our project, about your project!  We need a lot of support to make this a success.




Well, you can see that too.  We'll give you the chance to form your own conclusion based on what you see.  We've put together a 15 min documentary where we show you the video (dissecting it frame by frame) with our video tools and also a brief interview with the abductee.   Oh, you also get a cool LED lamp!  Just remember to pick up a wall mount USB power adapter for it.  Otherwise, plug it into any powered USB port and your good to go!   P.S.:  I wouldn't sleep with this in your bedroom at night!
This perk is only available to those that have chosen one of the other perks first!   Oh yeah, that was supposed to be a secret.",37.0,4,"3 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The CHEWED production is underway. We had an extremely successful shoot on August 20th and 21st. Very hot, very hectic, time was always running out, but we got it done. I am incredibly lucky to have such an amazing team behind this project.</p>
<p>We now have Casey Parsons slated to do our illustrating, and he's presently working on a comic project called Blood Moon. <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/caseyparsonsart/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/caseyparsonsart/</a></p>
<p>FX artist Scott Patterson did some GREAT work on the first shoot, and he's of course an integral part of the next outdoor shoot as well.</p>
<p>Toulouse Le Chat's scenes are all shot! (he plays ""Ezekiel"" in Chewed)</p>
<p>We were also so lucky to have pro stunt coordinator Ken Quinn on board as a stunt consultant. Things could have gotten ugly without him!</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This campaign is, of course, a continuation of the first one. Many people were disappointed they didn't get to contribute, and this is their chance to fix that! :) </p>
<p>I'm going to have paintings as perks again, along with guitar lessons (that's new). The other perks, posters, soundtracks, supporter credits, etc. will be back as well.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>When I heard legendary director, George A. Romero speak at a recent convention he lamented the fact that horror movies don't have any deeper meaning these days. Chewed addresses that problem, and delivers with a sense of humour and guts (literal and figurative).</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We are almost done shooting! We have one more day to go, mostly outdoors, and we're going to gather the crew together again, borrow a Jeep, and race (carefully) up and down a narrow trail in the ""jungles"" of Hamilton. It is exciting to make a movie, but expensive (even a short), and this is the lowest of the low budget scale. I'm just barely squeaking by, while directing, editing, composing the score, and producing myself. </p>

<p>The heart and soul of Hero's Song is in our world creation. In fact, the mythos we're making is so important to the game that we partnered with New York Times Bestselling author <strong><i>Patrick Rothfuss</i></strong> to help us make it awesome. He's been working with us to create this amazing backstory.</p>
<p>The backstory to Hero’s Song changes each time you create a new world, but it still has elements of the backstory we created woven into it.</p>
<p>Each god is unique and has specific interests which influence the physical geography of the world, who lives there, and how its history plays out. For example if you choose Nae, Goddess of the Sea as one of your elder gods, you'll end up with a lot more oceans; if you choose Cor, The Mad Smith, you should expect to see a lot more mountains. But the influence of the gods only begins with the geography of your world. Those same gods also impact the next phase of world creation - our deep world history.</p>

<h3 style=""color:#003e62;""><strong>What is the game actually about? Is there a main quest? What's my goal?</strong></h3>
<p>The game is about living a life of adventure in a world filled with monsters, mysteries and magic to be uncovered. For many, the journey is the goal. Others yearn for their character to ascend to become a God. </p>
<p>The core of the game is the amazing world that is created anew based on your choices and the history generator that literally creates the entire population of the world with complete history that has real ramifications for passing down skills through bloodlines over time. </p>
<p>There is no main quest but you'll find plenty of quests and glory. The world is filled with interesting NPCs and dangerous monsters each designed to function on their own and understand the world around them. Our goal is as much emergent behavior as possible so that no play through will be exactly the same as a previous one.</p>
<p>As you explore through the world you level up your character in your chosen class, grow more powerful and discover powerful magical relics of ancient times. </p>
<h3 style=""color:#003e62;""><strong>How is it any different than any other action RPG?</strong></h3>
<p>First and foremost our world creation is designed to create a believable fantasy world complete with geography and a history that actually impacts gameplay by actually changing the world itself and determining those races, classes and Gods that will be available. Our goal is to make a fantasy world that feels believeable. That's a very different game than making a story driven RPG. In Hero's Song, the story is actually yours as you adventure through this particular world. This is open world sandbox gaming through and through. </p>
<h3 style=""color:#003e62;""><strong>What influence do the Gods actually have outside of race and class choices and terrain?</strong></h3>
<p>The Gods are not merely abstract ideas. They are beings of massive power but they are real and -- although it's incredibly difficult -- they can be killed and the rewards can be rich. They also have tangible impacts on their followers since the magic system for Priests is based on belief.</p>
<h3 style=""color:#003e62;""><strong>How do I ascend?</strong></h3>
<p>Ascension happens when you reach level 50 and have passed through the Trials.</p>
<h3 style=""color:#003e62;""><strong>What is the world like?</strong></h3>
<p>You can see the art style from the screenshots and video, but in terms of gameplay, the world is very much a high fantasy style game. That means cities and towns are spread out over vast areas of wilderness. The different races live in different parts of the world: so as you travel you'll encounter different architectures, flora and fauna as you start your character based on your selected race.</p>
<p>The world can also be very, very large. We wanted exploration to be very important so we aren't planning on a ton of simple fast travel. Some of the classes are able to do things (for example, Druids can use Druid rings for their parties) but we wanted travel and the journey itself to matter. During that journey you'll cross deserts, mountains, rivers, swamps and jungles in all kinds of climates. </p>
<p>You can provision yourself at various shops in the cities and around the world (including wandering vendors). </p>
<p>The world is also filled with dungeons, caves and many other places to explore and adventure, all of which is generated at the start during world creation.</p>
<h3 style=""color:#003e62;""><strong>How does leveling work? </strong></h3>
<p>We use a very traditional class based system with a bunch of classes and races to choose from. You raise in levels by gaining experience through combat, the use of skills and other adventuring related activities.</p>
<h3 style=""color:#003e62;""><strong>How about items? </strong></h3>
<p>We have tens of thousands of different items in the game including many different types and categories of weapons (melee and ranged), armor, magic items and artifacts. Items have stats associated with them and many of them have abilities tied to them.</p>
<h3 style=""color:#003e62;""><strong>How does multiplayer work?</strong></h3>
<p>You can either choose to join a server through our server browser or host a server on your machine. Our goal is to get thousands of players having their data stored on a server with hundreds playing at a time (subject to the machine and bandwidth). </p>
<p>Playing Multiplayer you'll see people's names above their heads and be able to chat with them (racial language DOES matter here) and you can adventure together (or fight on a PVP server).</p>
<h3 style=""color:#003e62;""><strong>What kind of controls do I get if I'm hosting a server?</strong></h3>
<p>You'll be able to control who is allowed on the server as well as being able to kick or ban people. In addition, you'll determine which Gods are available, whether it's a PVP server and many other options.</p>
<h3 style=""color:#003e62;""><strong>How long is a game session going to last?</strong></h3>
<p>Our goal going in is to create a constantly evolving world in which you can get lost.  That means the world won't always be exactly like you left it because things have been going on while you're gone.  Since that's the style of game we're making we think you'll have fun popping in for 20 minutes or playing for hours at a time.</p>

Hero's Song is a hardcore action RPG and uses the familiar click-to-move and attack controls of classic action RPGs like Diablo III or Path of Exile. Combat takes a more measured pace, giving you time to react to the intelligent tactics of your enemies and to thoughtfully deploy your wide variety of skills and abilities. True to its hardcore nature, combat in Hero's Song is dangerous and has very real consequences including the chance of permanent death. Friendly fire is always defaulted to ""on"", so positioning and precision are very important considerations. Death will come quickly if you think this is a simple clickfest.



 

In Hero's Song players can control their own server and host thousands of other players (with up to hundreds playing at one time.)

Join an existing community or host your own server
Create and control your worlds and make each server truly unique
Decide who gets to play on your server
It's your choice to disallow friendly fire and PvP


 


 ""Ever was the Lonely God in The Kalos""



 

 
The heart and soul of Hero's Song is in our world creation. In fact, the mythos we're making is so important to the game that we partnered with New York Times Bestselling author Patrick Rothfuss to help us make it awesome. He's been working with us to create this amazing backstory.
The backstory to Hero’s Song changes each time you create a new world, but it still has elements of the backstory we created woven into it.
Each god is unique and has specific interests which influence the physical geography of the world, who lives there, and how its history plays out. For example if you choose Nae, Goddess of the Sea as one of your elder gods, you'll end up with a lot more oceans; if you choose Cor, The Mad Smith, you should expect to see a lot more mountains. But the influence of the gods only begins with the geography of your world. Those same gods also impact the next phase of world creation - our deep world history.

 




 

The gods you choose to bind to your world influences far more than its physical geography. The gods also shape its entire population and thousands of years of history including the wars that were fought, the great plagues that ravaged the land, and the rise and fall of entire civilizations. On one world, Dranuk Dwarves may have never existed; on another, the Varloosh have fought a never-ending war with the Analathi Elves.  
The possibilities are near endless and ever expanding. This unique world history runs deep into the very bloodlines of the heroes you play, with family traits passed down through the ages and the treasures of your heritage waiting to be discovered.

 




 

From an ever-expanding cosmology, you determine the pantheon for each world; choosing the gods of creation and the balance of divine power. These choices shape the world, its vast history, and the nature of its afterlife.
These are just a few of the gods that are available and more will be added over time, both by the Pixelmage team and by the players themselves as their heroes prove worthy to ascend into godhood! 

 



 

Once you've created a world, or joined an existing one online, you'll then be able to choose your first character to play. Each world has been uniquely shaped by the gods and thousands of years of history so your available character options will never be the same! For example, on one world the entire civilization of Dranuk Dwarves may have been wiped out by generations of war with the Analathi Elves. In a world like that, Dranuk Dwarves wouldn't exist and could not be an option. But by the same token, perhaps it was during this war that the art of Necromancy was discovered, opening up class options that make use of that school of magic.
All playable characters also have unique histories and genealogical trees that will determine many of their stats and abilities.
Each character can then also be further customized to suit your personal taste and desired playstyle.

 

 

There are a wide variety of fantasy races possible within each unique world. These are just a few of them. We'll be revealing more over time.


 


 
Hero's Song is deeply rooted in classic RPGs and features a wide variety of classes. Each class offers a distinctly different play style and some will be easier to play than others; allowing you to choose how you want to experience the world. Here are just a few of the classes that may be available on any unique world. We expect to expand this list.
 




 
The world is filled with interesting NPCs and dangerous monsters each designed to function on their own and understand the world around them. Our goal is as much emergent behavior as possible so that no play through will be exactly the same as a previous one.
 




 
Magic takes many forms in the world of Hero's Song, and it's not as simple as different versions of fireballs or magic missiles. There are a variety of magic systems that give magic users a lot of options for gameplay. Magic is something that's very powerful and learning its arcane secrets can be a difficult thing.

We got into this business to make great games. We decided to make our business model as simple and fair as possible. There are a lot of great games out there that have microtransactions as a part of them. Many of us on the Development Team have been involved with that business model for years and we decided we wanted Pixelmage Games to be different. Our games will have no microtransactions and they will be reasonably priced. We will offer two versions of Hero's Song. The regular version will be $19.99 and the Deluxe Edition version will be $49.99. The Deluxe Edition includes the soundtrack by Inon Zur, the digital strategy guide and a wallpaper pack. Aside from that there are no differences.

Our goal is as much emergent behavior as possible so that no play through will be exactly the same as a previous one.
As you explore through the world you level up your character in your chosen class, grow more powerful and discover powerful magical relics of ancient times. 
How is it any different than any other action RPG?
First and foremost our world creation is designed to create a believable fantasy world complete with geography and a history that actually impacts gameplay by actually changing the world itself and determining those races, classes and Gods that will be available. Our goal is to make a fantasy world that feels believeable. That's a very different game than making a story driven RPG. In Hero's Song, the story is actually yours as you adventure through this particular world. This is open world sandbox gaming through and through. 
What influence do the Gods actually have outside of race and class choices and terrain?
The Gods are not merely abstract ideas. They are beings of massive power but they are real and -- although it's incredibly difficult -- they can be killed and the rewards can be rich. They also have tangible impacts on their followers since the magic system for Priests is based on belief.
How do I ascend?
Ascension happens when you reach level 50 and have passed through the Trials.
What is the world like?
You can see the art style from the screenshots and video, but in terms of gameplay, the world is very much a high fantasy style game. That means cities and towns are spread out over vast areas of wilderness. The different races live in different parts of the world: so as you travel you'll encounter different architectures, flora and fauna as you start your character based on your selected race.
The world can also be very, very large. We wanted exploration to be very important so we aren't planning on a ton of simple fast travel. Some of the classes are able to do things (for example, Druids can use Druid rings for their parties) but we wanted travel and the journey itself to matter. During that journey you'll cross deserts, mountains, rivers, swamps and jungles in all kinds of climates. 
You can provision yourself at various shops in the cities and around the world (including wandering vendors). 
The world is also filled with dungeons, caves and many other places to explore and adventure, all of which is generated at the start during world creation.
How does leveling work? 
We use a very traditional class based system with a bunch of classes and races to choose from. You raise in levels by gaining experience through combat, the use of skills and other adventuring related activities.
How about items? 
We have tens of thousands of different items in the game including many different types and categories of weapons (melee and ranged), armor, magic items and artifacts. Items have stats associated with them and many of them have abilities tied to them.
How does multiplayer work?
You can either choose to join a server through our server browser or host a server on your machine. Our goal is to get thousands of players having their data stored on a server with hundreds playing at a time (subject to the machine and bandwidth). 
Playing Multiplayer you'll see people's names above their heads and be able to chat with them (racial language DOES matter here) and you can adventure together (or fight on a PVP server).
What kind of controls do I get if I'm hosting a server?
You'll be able to control who is allowed on the server as well as being able to kick or ban people. In addition, you'll determine which Gods are available, whether it's a PVP server and many other options.
How long is a game session going to last?
Our goal going in is to create a constantly evolving world in which you can get lost.  That means the world won't always be exactly like you left it because things have been going on while you're gone.  Since that's the style of game we're making we think you'll have fun popping in for 20 minutes or playing for hours at a time.

The Pixelmage Philosophy
We formed Pixelmage Games to make the games we want to play. We are huge fans of incredibly deep and immersive game play. We love the 2D pixel art of our youth, freed of all its technical limitations. We also love open worlds and the emergent gameplay that results from layer upon layer of simple rule systems interacting with each other, and love unleashing the player to use his/her tools and abilities in creative ways. We also love and root for our AI creations. We want the denizens of our virtual worlds to be deep and interesting and maybe even respected and feared. We are gamers first, developers second.
You Can Help!
Pixelmage Games has already raised $2.8M in investment. We estimate we're going to need an additional $200k to finish the game. Making an incredibly fun game is our main goal and we need your help. We have a passionate team of professionals building the game they want to play. We will be releasing frequent development updates so that you're well aware of progress that’s being made. Hopefully you'll consider backing Hero’s Song.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Over the past 18 years, Santa Barbara based non-profit AHA! (Attitude. Harmony. Achievement.) has created programs that empower teens to stop bullying, communicate effectively, create peaceful and socially equitable environments, listen deeply and respect diversity, deal with challenging emotions, and make great decisions that lead to their present and future success.</p>
<p>One of the programs that AHA! offers is called Sing it Out. This 16 week journey helps teens to discover the power of community and self expression through musical performance and shared vulnerability. For the past nine months, our small group of filmmakers has passionately documented this process. Filming Sing it Out has been one of the most rewarding and inspiring projects we've ever had the privilege to work on. Join us as we embark on the final editing stage. We need your help to make this film everything we know it has the potential to be.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>Our small but committed team has worked on a shoestring budget to film the Sing it Out process over the course of several months. We've shot over 60 hours of footage for the project, but we still need funding to complete the final film. These costs include: follow-up interviews with the kids, film editing, music scoring, color grading, audio mastering, music licensing, legal fees, and festival fees for the film. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>During the 16 weeks that we spent filming AHA’s Sing it Out, we were blown away watching how much each of these teens grew just by going through this program. We witnessed them transform into kinder, stronger and more confident individuals than they had ever imagined themselves being.</p>
<p>Through the Sing it Out program, we have watched AHA! change the youth culture here in Santa Barbara into a more inclusive, supportive and welcoming society. We anticipate the film bringing this message to a wide audience through film festivals, media organizations, and online release, in order to transform other communities around the world. And we need your help to make this happen.</p>

<h3>Who Am I &amp; Why Did I Make This Film?</h3>
<ul>
<li>I am a filmmaker, writer, and a business partner with a  music producer.  I have filmed countless songwriting sessions in our music studio with the best songwriters and artists in the music business.  I have also filmed hundred of hours of other artists and entrepreneurs as they work on their craft.  As I silently stand behind my camera, I have been given a VIP access to observe artists at work.  I have seen into their minds and souls a little deeper and with that, I have gained healing and insight.  I want to share that healing and insight with others with my film and with the subsequent online docu-series</li>
<li>I am excited about SOUL PROVIDERS because art and artists are vital to our growth and to our experience as human beings.  When I was in my darkest hours in the past couple of years after tragically and unexpectedly losing my best friend and my brother in the same year, it was the artists (those I knew personally and those I didn't know at all), their art, their thought processes, the inspiration for their art, and the execution of their visions that healed my soul and made ME want to create again</li>
<li>I filmed ten artists that I was most affected by during this time in my life - music artists, filmmakers, designers, illustrators - who live and work in Los Angeles, and I can't wait to share their insights, personalities, creative inspirations, and sage advice with the world.  I truly believe this film will speak to other artists and art lovers worldwide. </li>
<li>I've already completed the bulk of the project.  I now need help to get it out into the world.  That's where you can be my rock star! </li>
<li>This is a special time in the SOUL PROVIDERS overall project (which includes the feature film and the later online docu-series) because this is a time that YOU can get involved and be a part of the film, forever.  There is even an opportunity for artists to get a FEATURED ROLE in the future SOUL PROVIDERS docu-series! This is when you can get your name in the credits, score tickets to screenings, get feedback on YOUR artistic projects, and even have dinner with ME. (I'm fun, I promise!) Any contribution level will forever be etched in my heart.  You will be a BIG part in making sure this film didn't die in my hard drive.  </li>
<li>Your contribution - big or small - will help me get this film out to as many film festivals as possible, starting with the most prestigious and best matched for this film, all the way down to the festivals in small towns for dedicated local film lovers  </li>
<li>With your contribution, I will also be able to start production on the SOUL PROVIDERS docu-series which will spotlight other artists <i>worldwide</i>.  There is also an opportunity right now, for a limited time and limited to only 10 people, to be FEATURED in the SOUL PROVIDERS docu-series! The first of the series will be the Los Angeles artists from the feature film, but the docu-series will include bonus footage <i>not shown in the film</i>.  All other subsequent series will include artists from all over the United States and the world!  (And maybe YOU!) I'm so excited to get out and film artists in other locations around the world!  </li>

I will film artists in other locations - featuring artists in New York, San Francisco & the Bay Area, Paris, London, and more.  I already have subjects lined up in each city/region and I'm excited to see what new dimensions the participants in differing locations adds to the SOUL PROVIDERS canvas!  Each artist furthering the interest in art and artists worldwide, inspiring future art, artists, and supporters of art!


""I love having an idea, a musical idea in my head, and being able to realize it"" - Dapo Torimiro, Artist/Music Producer


""I believe art is EVERYTHING"" - Onch, Designer

""Art is such an important piece of the planet Earth"" - Ivory, Artist/Songwriter/Illustrator

""The best thing about what I do for a living is that I guess I feel I have some sort of purpose"" - Oren Yoel, Music Producer

The Film Festival Plan...

We have a film festival plan that prioritizes the film festivals.  From the most prestigious/most perfect match for this film, all the way down to just the supportive film goers festivals, we will put funds first towards the festivals with potentially the biggest impact and then work our way down from there based on how much we raise.  
Sometimes by getting into the bigger festivals, smaller festivals send you an invite and your entry fee is waived.  If that happens, that's more money to go towards the docu-series! 
We will continue to add fundraising perks over the course of this campaign based on how much we raise, so check back often!


""I think art is really important. It's the only thing in life that can bring joy to people"" - Ester Brym, Filmmaker/Editor

""Art and music and every other kind of expression, those are the kinds of things that really keep us together"" - Jarell Perry, Artist/Songwriter

""I think what's great about it, is that it offers me a deeper understanding of who I am"" - Julia Huffman, Filmmaker/Activist

""It's my go-to 'peace'"" - Stephanie Owens, Actress/DIYer

""I believe that art is seriously, the best currency we have in the world"" - Scotty Grand, Artist/Songwriter

<p>Howdy Folks, </p>
<p>My name is Lauryn Eisenstein, writer and director of <i><strong>Goodnight, Cowboy</strong></i>, my BFA thesis film at Columbia College Hollywood. For the past decade, I have been writing, directing, and producing films, which have earned me film festival wins, competitions, exclusive classes and workshops, and mentorship from the actor Burt Reynolds. I want this to be the best film I've made yet, because it holds a very special place in my heart and I have put all my blood, sweat, and tears into it over the last seven months and will continue to do so until it's completed.</p>
<p><strong><i>Goodnight, Cowboy</i> </strong>is a cross-generational film about <strong>REAGAN TAYLOR (20s)</strong>,a reserved and quiet home healthcare nurse who’s afraid of commitments and spends her days taking care of old dying patients to avoid her real truth. Her current patient is <strong>JETT WILDER (70s)</strong>, a dying washed-up actor and free-spirited prankster. The two form an unlikely friendship filled with unexpected adventures, nostalgia, and understanding of each others lives. When Jett becomes more ill he decides that he's lived a full life and wants to die, but can't go through with killing himself. Jett's inability to kill himself forces him to request that Reagan assist in his suicide. Reagan being the person she is; a person who helps people live not die has to decide to either go against everything she believes in as a care-giver to help him die with the dignity he has left or not do anything and let him die suffering from an illness that will make his fun and exciting personality unrecognizable. Having this decision forces her to accept his friendship and love for her and acknowledge her love for him in return. <i><strong>Goodnight, Cowboy</strong></i> at its core is about the the ability to create your own family  and the sacrifices one makes for love.</p>
<p>This film isn't just any film to me; it's a  testament to the strong friendships I've made with people much older than myself and highlights the lessons I've learned so far in life. Goodnight, Cowboy is not just my thesis film;  it represents the films I want to create throughout my career as writer, director and producer, which is why it is near and dear to my heart. </p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Goodnight, Cowboy is extremely complex and expensive, and in order to ensure that it be the best it can be, we need your help! My producers and I spent days hand-picking each and every person working on this film I have spent days with each department head to carefully discuss every element that will be involved during all phases of production. The departments that are most important to us include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Camera Department</li>
<li>Art Department</li>
<li>Production Department</li>
<li>Post Production Department</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the budget will be allocated to production design, locations, and wardrobe. The film pays homage to the style of golden age Hollywood classics and Westerns.

<ul>
<li>A Western Ranch</li>
<li>A Hollywood Hills Mansion</li>
<li>Hospital </li>
<li>Park</li>
<li>1960s Convertible car</li>
</ul>
<p>The actors not only have to act their parts, they have to look their parts too. This requires not only casual clothing, but also the clothing items that we dreamed about as children when we dressed up as cowboys and cowgirls. In addition to wardrobe, the funds we raise will be used for:</p>

LARRY DEVLIN, an ambitious Second World War veteran is appointed CIA station chief. Washington needs the Congo for its uranium and the cobalt. Devlin hates communism and is prepared to do everything in his power to ensure Congo does not fall into hands of the Soviet Union. PATRICE LUMUMBA, the Marxist revolutionary and first democratically elected Prime Minister of Congo, is a thorn on the side of the USA administration with his radical anti imperialist rhetoric. Devlin works with the country army chief JOSEPH MOBUTU. Lumumba is assassinated with the help of CIA, M16 and Belgian intelligence.</p><p>Che addresses the United Nation General Assembly in New York and refers to Lumumba as a martyr and calls for the free people of the world to avenge the crime of the Congo. Soon after his speech, with the blessings of Castro, Che goes on a two-month tour of eight African countries where he meets leaders of revolutionary movements. His aim is to create an international movement to fight imperialism. LAURENT KABILA, 26 years old, a Marxist rebel leader, makes an impression on Che. Kabila agrees with Che about the need to fight imperialism; and also his forces have already captured two thirds of the Congo. Che offers him help.</p><p>Che returns to Cuba an inspired man. In a meeting with Castro, he makes a case for Cuba to support revolutionary movements across the globe. While Castro is in agreement with Che and willing to offer logistics and training, he is shocked when Che tells him he wants to leave Cuba and lead a revolution in Bolivia. Castro warns him about Bolivia. The political climate there is not ready for a revolution. He advises Che to go to Congo. Castro wants him to prepare and familiarize himself with the conditions in Congo, but Che is impatient. Aware the CIA wants to assassinate him, Che decides not to communicate with Kabila about his intention to come fight in Congo.</p><p>Che puts on a disguise.

Also the situation has changed dramatically since the last two met. Kabila no longer controls two thirds of the country. Che finds an embattled rebel group that is profoundly demoralized.</p><p>Kabila is happy the Cuban soldiers are in Congo but not Che. He is afraid Che’s presence will attract the attention of the USA government with disastrous results. He instructs Che not to reveal his identity. Later he gets news that his mother has died. He is overwhelmed with sadness and remorse, but conceals this in public, with a show of strength and resolution.</p><p>Kabila wants to attack the military garrison and a hydroelectric plant at Fort Bendera. Che is against the attack as it carries a huge risk and it will expose the presence of the Cuban soldiers. There are 300 enemy soldiers and 100 mercenaries at the military garrison. Kabila insists. Che shares his armed guerilla techniques theory but the rebels are not interested. They put their faith on a Dawa, a traditional medicine man to help them become invisible during the battle. They are also superstitious and refuse to dig trenches for protection; holes are to bury the dead. Che is dismissive, which angers the rebels. He is arrogant and they want him to leave. Castro sends a message to Che saying he must be patient with the rebels and must not lose hope. Che writes back to Castro. He has made a profound mistake, Kabila is not a revolutionary. He does not come to the battlefront  with his men, but prefers to stay at expensive hotels with different women.  </p><p>Che remains behind while the Cuban soldiers and the rebels launch an attack. The enemy proves tough. The rebels drop their arms and run away. Four Cuban soldiers are killed and their retreating comrades are forced to leave their bodies behind. Che is devastated.

Er bringt den Therapeuten Dr. Ronginson dazu selbst über seine geheimen Probleme zu sprechen. Den zu Beginn sehr ausgewogenen und souveränen Therapeuten scheinen eine Menge Dinge zu plagen und auf der Seele zu brennen. Hauptsächlich seine Vergangenheit in der er seine Frau und seinen kleinen Sohn im Stich ließ um ein neues Leben und eine neue Familie zu gründen.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, my name's Cristina, I'm the producer of this film. Me and Lana met at film course, we get along on this project defending LGBT rights because both of us come from Post-Soviet Union countries where the amount of homophobes is bigger than actual homosexuals. The paradoxical fact is that women always had the right to be lesbians, while male homosexuality was included in criminal code.

</div></div>","Short Summary
Hi, my name's Cristina, I'm the producer of this film. Me and Lana met at film course, we get along on this project defending LGBT rights because both of us come from Post-Soviet Union countries where the amount of homophobes is bigger than actual homosexuals. The paradoxical fact is that women always had the right to be lesbians, while male homosexuality was included in criminal code. Even when Soviet Union has fallen in 1991, and four years later was legalised homosexual activity they still don't have many rights, and they are not respected by the majority. There is a special word describing gays in Russian language 'pederasty' that is a derivation from word 'paedophile', meaning sexual activity involving a man and a boy. Scientifically, pederast and paedophile is a same thing, but in Soviet Union they put gay along with them. Being gay is a choice, while pederast or paedophilia is a crime.

<h3>The Film</h3>
<p>Incorporating elements of genre horror and art-house cinema with a heavy dose of conspiracy culture, the film is a must-see for fans of filmmakers like John Carpenter, David Lynch and Jim Jarmusch and for those of the Fortean persuasion. </p>
<p>Bright Rectangle Films was founded by long-time creative partners Bill Darmon and Chris Ernst, who collectively bring over two decades of diverse experience in independent film and video production. We are taking the first steps towards creating a microstudio that makes the kind of movies that we feel audiences (like us) need today.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Principal photography and a rough cut are complete. We have already successfully captured most of our original script- and the edit runs approximately 70 minutes.  The film is very close to completion and only a bit more is needed- we're in the home stretch! We need funds to shoot additional VFX scenes and cover post-production costs like digital effects, music licensing, recording an original score, sound design and mixing, and color correction. </p>
<p>Perks will include swag that feature original designs from the film- as well as original props and production materials that help see you beyond the veil of the production- and transport you to this twisted version of the haunted southwest, just like the finished movie eventually will. Blu-Rays, VHS, and downloadable media will be available in the Fall of 2019, after we hit the Festivals. All other items will be shipped out as soon as we can, with an estimate by the end of August 2018.</p>
<p>We'll also make the movie available in a VHS format- and its score available on cassette- because at its core, this movie is a product of the 80s and 90s. We'd like to think it's the kind of movie John Carpenter would have made given the same material (if written by the mutant child of Lawrence Kasdan, Dan O'Bannon, and Earl Mac Rauch). </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Fritz Leiber, well known by many fans of classic genre and pulp literature, was an American writer of fantasy, horror, and science fiction. Alongside writers such as Robert E. Howard and Michael Moorcock, Leiber can be regarded as one of the fathers of sword and sorcery fantasy, having coined the term. An early writer of “Weird” fiction, he initiated a brief yet intense correspondence with H.P. Lovecraft, who ""encouraged and influenced [Leiber's] literary development"" before succumbing to his death. Beginning in the late 1950s, he was increasingly influenced by the works of Carl Jung, particularly by the concepts of the anima and the shadow. From the mid-1960s onwards, he began incorporating elements of Joseph Campbell's The Hero with a Thousand Faces. We were lucky to be able to work with Leiber’s estate and gain the rights to this fantastic story.</p>
<p>We expanded THATH to feature length in the spirit of Fritz Leiber's entire body of work.</p>
<p>To further that end- we shot THATH in a 2.66:1 aspect- a bit wider than 'scope- and if we're being honest, we'd prefer it show only in glorious CINERAMA- to really capture the spirit of the movie's unique locations in northeastern New Mexico and southeastern Colorado- eye-searing landscapes that rarely go up on the big screen.</p>

<p><u><strong>In a Nut Shell.</strong></u></p>
<p>Hey! Thanks for checking out our campaign. My name is Arwen Hawley-Brandt, I am a 23-year-old filmmaker from Devon, studying in my final year of Film at Falmouth University in Cornwall. I am also the writer, director, producer and editor for Pulse. I have a vast range of experience within both filmmaking and editing, and pride myself on the quality of my work. </p>
<p>Pulse is my dissertation film for my final year at University; not only is it hugely important in terms of my degree, but also within my future career opportunities. This film will help me convey to future employers my abilities and creativity within this field of filmmaking, and can assist me within my career prospects in the future. <br/><br/>Not only will Pulse assist me within my filmmaking future, it is also an opportunity for local creatives and artists to work together within a inspiring environment, to expand within their own field of work. The film is split into 20 individual scenes, each a film within itself, all to be edited together into a beautiful mess of visual empowerment and powerful images.<br/><br/>We are filming throughout March when the weather gets better, and shall have the film completed (hopefully) by April, ready to be sent to film festivals around the world. The end result shall not only be an amazing 10 minute film, but also an exhibition-fundraiser to raise money for a charity helping those with addiction issues. <br/><br/>So, please, have a look at the rest of our plans, the people who are working on the production, and see if this interests you. Thank you so much. Arwen. <br/><br/><br/><u><strong>The Story and Plan.</strong></u><br/><br/>Pulse is a ten minute experimental film, evolving around a hallucinogenic drug trip; the movie begins as a beautiful and fairy-tale like journey, but quickly sours and spirals into a living hell. Rather than having the main character physically being in each scene with the audience witnessing her ordeal through reactions and actions, we are instead seeing her experience directly through her eyes, as she is living it.<br/><br/>As a result, we are planning to create 20 individual scenes, each one revolved around separate and evolving colour, theme and style. Pulse is also a unique production, as we are having local artists and creators within both Devon and Cornwall collaborate within many scenes, including carpenters, special effects artists, and florists.<br/>This is a winner for all, in the sense it gives the creators a platform and opportunity to be as creative as they wish and excel within their art form, but also help make Pulse a more unique and enticing visual experience for the audience.<br/><br/>Below is the timeline and reflecting colour chart for 'Pulse', showcasing the development of context compared to the colouring for when I'm editing. <br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1518709561/bcnvonfg6mrfmdm2kn5i.png"" src=""""/><br/><br/><u><strong>Pre-Production Work.</strong></u><br/><br/>Much research has gone into the creation of Pulse; watching films containing drug trips as well as old age experimental films encouraged the creative process, as did conducting surveys of those who have experienced visual drug trips. Studying these films and their different creative aspects ensured I styled my own scenes around originality and creative development within my writing and design for Pulse. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1518709721/hzzmaxvfmkb11wjvxhph.png"" src=""""/><br/><br/>During my research I conducted a survey, asking people who had taken hallucinogenic drugs what they had seen and experienced; the results have helped my vastly within the development of creating this piece . . . <br/><br/><i>'On ecstacy once I saw purple beards on women, also children skipping down the pavements of deserted streets in the early morning and also saw victorianwoman pushing a large victoriana pram across a road in front of our vehicle'<br/><br/>'Looked like trees were waving at me in the wind and it’s like everything was those fibre optic lights and I would just seen colour changing light everywhere'<br/><br/>'Took a pill I’d never taken before. I started to feel awful so went to bed when we got home. The outlines of objects in the room changed into threatening things (a backpack on a chair was a massive gorilla, a dressing gown hanging off the wardrobe was a girl with no head. Etc) so I went outside to try and clear my head, I sat down and I was sat on the floor of the club with the flashing lights and people around me, I couldn’t shake the image it was really scary. I can’t remember what happened from there but it put me off pills for life'<br/><br/>'I saw a dark shadow standing at the end of my bed, he was just standing there; he then began to pull my covers off my body for what felt like hours, me tugging against his pulls' <br/><br/>'...Ketamine however was a very different experience.. That made me lose all control of my legs and convinced me that the floor was definitely lava and so I couldn't get off the sofa'</i><br/><br/>Some of these statements have been used as a spring board within the imagery and narratives that will occur within Pulse. <br/>____________________<br/><br/><u><strong>Production Design </strong></u><br/><br/>The production design has been heavily influence by the work of Anya Antia and Nicolas Bruno, both creative photographers; Anya uses extremely beautiful imagery within her work, mostly working with female models and animals, creating fairytale like photographs with the usage of props, lighting and costumes. For the first half of Pulse, much of my designs have been heavily influenced by her creations. <br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1518709780/exhvd8ltfu6ixcj5mfyu.png"" src=""""/><br/><br/><a href=""https://anya-anti.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://anya-anti.com</a><br/><br/>Nicolas Bruno is also a photographer, who creates photos re-creating his night-terrors; strong, dark images obtain his work and holds a hellish-feel within the photos.

<p>•NCCC Film &amp; Animation Festival</p>
<p>•Universal Film Festival</p>
<p>•Raindance</p>
<p>•Encounters Festival </p>
<p><br/><br/><u><strong>Exhibition. </strong></u><br/>Due to the subject of Pulse, I felt there was a real opportunity here to give something back; <br/>I want Pulse to not only showcase a seriously dark drug trip, but to also represent the journey drug abusers often entail, with their addiction beginning as an amazing aspect to their life, before it quickly spirals into a living hell. As a result, we are holding the premiere, an exhibition and a fundraiser all in one in the summer, to not only open the film to the world, but to also showcase the talent of those involved, all whilst raising money for a charity helping those with addictions. <br/>We have a charity who have agreed to be involved, but only once they have seen the finished product, due to the context. <br/><br/>The Exhibition will give all the artists, musicians, creators and people involved  within the production to show their work, their abilities, and to also give them an opportunity to gain more work through this event. Each shall have their own table to show and discuss their creative history, their contribution to the film, their process and future ambitions to the visitors of the event. <br/><br/><br/><u><strong>Funding.</strong></u></p>
<p>Any help given financially to create this piece will be hugely appreciated in so many ways; it'll result in me being able to produce a film of higher quality, creativity and will grant me the chance to fully show my capabilities within this region of artistry. <br/><br/>The money is needed for a range of reasons; we want to create the most high-quality film possible, and unfortunately, this takes both time and money. Props, makeup, sources, travel expenses and everything in-between add up quickly. We have, however, planned and budgeted a basic sum of £2,200 to cover travel, crew, food, costumes and makeup, festival entry fees and to organize our Exhibition piece.<br/><br/>Please note, I am wanting to pay people within the production for their materials used, and also their time; you can't buy bread or pay your rent with 'exposure', so why not have both? I, however, obviously, will not be getting any money personally from my work on the production. </p>

<p><br/>Being a student film, and also wanting to pay people for their times and talents, every penny is going towards not only the creation of ‘Pulse’, but also financial recognition of peoples combined and individual efforts within the production.<br/><br/>If we do not reach our entire goal, the money will be spent in the most practical ways, towards both the production and with the crew; props are a key aspect within our production, just as much as it is supplying our crew with the tools they need to create and do what they have to do.  As a result, the money will be budgeted to the best way we can manage.</p>
<p>Overall, this film is not just a film to any of the crew; it’s an opportunity to be expressive creatively and artistically. Its giving people who are passionate and talented within their fields a rare chance to express themselves and create things that would otherwise not see the light of day. It will give me and them both the platform to expand their portfolio in a positive sense, and open opportunity’s for our creative future.<br/> </p>
<p><br/><u><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></u><br/>Like anything to do with film,  creativity and life in general - Nothing goes according to plan. Things mess up, plans a scuppered, the weather lets you down and so do people. However, with Pulse having such a variety of people, places and narratives involved, even if 50% went wrong (which it won't!) I will still possess enough footage to create an equally unique, beautiful and enticing film. Its gonna be good! :) <br/><br/> </p>

</div></div>","In a Nut Shell.
Hey! Thanks for checking out our campaign. My name is Arwen Hawley-Brandt, I am a 23-year-old filmmaker from Devon, studying in my final year of Film at Falmouth University in Cornwall. I am also the writer, director, producer and editor for Pulse. I have a vast range of experience within both filmmaking and editing, and pride myself on the quality of my work. 
Pulse is my dissertation film for my final year at University; not only is it hugely important in terms of my degree, but also within my future career opportunities. This film will help me convey to future employers my abilities and creativity within this field of filmmaking, and can assist me within my career prospects in the future. Not only will Pulse assist me within my filmmaking future, it is also an opportunity for local creatives and artists to work together within a inspiring environment, to expand within their own field of work. The film is split into 20 individual scenes, each a film within itself, all to be edited together into a beautiful mess of visual empowerment and powerful images.We are filming throughout March when the weather gets better, and shall have the film completed (hopefully) by April, ready to be sent to film festivals around the world. The end result shall not only be an amazing 10 minute film, but also an exhibition-fundraiser to raise money for a charity helping those with addiction issues. So, please, have a look at the rest of our plans, the people who are working on the production, and see if this interests you. Thank you so much. Arwen. The Story and Plan.Pulse is a ten minute experimental film, evolving around a hallucinogenic drug trip; the movie begins as a beautiful and fairy-tale like journey, but quickly sours and spirals into a living hell. Rather than having the main character physically being in each scene with the audience witnessing her ordeal through reactions and actions, we are instead seeing her experience directly through her eyes, as she is living it.As a result, we are planning to create 20 individual scenes, each one revolved around separate and evolving colour, theme and style. Pulse is also a unique production, as we are having local artists and creators within both Devon and Cornwall collaborate within many scenes, including carpenters, special effects artists, and florists.This is a winner for all, in the sense it gives the creators a platform and opportunity to be as creative as they wish and excel within their art form, but also help make Pulse a more unique and enticing visual experience for the audience.Below is the timeline and reflecting colour chart for 'Pulse', showcasing the development of context compared to the colouring for when I'm editing. Pre-Production Work.Much research has gone into the creation of Pulse; watching films containing drug trips as well as old age experimental films encouraged the creative process, as did conducting surveys of those who have experienced visual drug trips. Studying these films and their different creative aspects ensured I styled my own scenes around originality and creative development within my writing and design for Pulse. 
During my research I conducted a survey, asking people who had taken hallucinogenic drugs what they had seen and experienced; the results have helped my vastly within the development of creating this piece . . . 'On ecstacy once I saw purple beards on women, also children skipping down the pavements of deserted streets in the early morning and also saw victorianwoman pushing a large victoriana pram across a road in front of our vehicle''Looked like trees were waving at me in the wind and it’s like everything was those fibre optic lights and I would just seen colour changing light everywhere''Took a pill I’d never taken before. I started to feel awful so went to bed when we got home. The outlines of objects in the room changed into threatening things (a backpack on a chair was a massive gorilla, a dressing gown hanging off the wardrobe was a girl with no head. Etc) so I went outside to try and clear my head, I sat down and I was sat on the floor of the club with the flashing lights and people around me, I couldn’t shake the image it was really scary. I can’t remember what happened from there but it put me off pills for life''I saw a dark shadow standing at the end of my bed, he was just standing there; he then began to pull my covers off my body for what felt like hours, me tugging against his pulls' '...Ketamine however was a very different experience.. That made me lose all control of my legs and convinced me that the floor was definitely lava and so I couldn't get off the sofa'Some of these statements have been used as a spring board within the imagery and narratives that will occur within Pulse. ____________________Production Design The production design has been heavily influence by the work of Anya Antia and Nicolas Bruno, both creative photographers; Anya uses extremely beautiful imagery within her work, mostly working with female models and animals, creating fairytale like photographs with the usage of props, lighting and costumes. For the first half of Pulse, much of my designs have been heavily influenced by her creations. https://anya-anti.comNicolas Bruno is also a photographer, who creates photos re-creating his night-terrors; strong, dark images obtain his work and holds a hellish-feel within the photos. The second half of Pulse has been hugely influenced by his style and beautiful creations. http://www.nicolasbrunophotography.com The imagery within Pulse shall be much like watching a Lucid Dream; inspired by these music videos, as well as the visual and audio work of Grimes, Clams Casino, Lorn, Apex Twin, Gotye, M83, The Smashing Pumpkins, Kate Bush, Fever Ray, The Avalanches, Marilyn Manson, Die Antwoord and more, the images obtain within these creations shall hold strong stance within Pulse. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEeNUnMaAf8https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_QsPuKtI3Mhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wokbmH1iGtUThe above links are strong examples of the atmosphere and imagery we aim to create. Throughout pre-production, much work and effort has gone into the production designs and aesthetical aims of Pulse; mood boards, storyboards, character design and costume ideas and plans have evolved and changed to a point of successful accomplishment in the prep for the film.
Painting, writing, costumes and props have been created, bought and planned, ready for the next coming months;  
Writing over 20 individual scenes is hard work, but each is designed and is catering for whoever is specialising within that scene and helping the character development within the film.Along with the script, detailed storyboards have been designed alongside them, to ensure prep and filming each scene will go as smoothly and accurately as possible.

I am looking forward to working on Pulse. http://www.northdevongazette.co.uk/news/torring...Throughout the next couple of months, I shall continue recruiting and getting other creative people on board;Festivals.Once the film is completed I plan on entering Pulse into a range of festivals around the world, hoping to showcase our work to a large group of people. Some of those include . . . •Short Cut  NYC International Cinemafest
•Big Sur International Short Film Festival
•Screamfest Horror Film Festival
•World Arts Film Festival
•Cinemafantastique 4
•NCCC Film & Animation Festival
•Universal Film Festival
•Raindance
•Encounters Festival 
Exhibition. Due to the subject of Pulse, I felt there was a real opportunity here to give something back; I want Pulse to not only showcase a seriously dark drug trip, but to also represent the journey drug abusers often entail, with their addiction beginning as an amazing aspect to their life, before it quickly spirals into a living hell. As a result, we are holding the premiere, an exhibition and a fundraiser all in one in the summer, to not only open the film to the world, but to also showcase the talent of those involved, all whilst raising money for a charity helping those with addictions. We have a charity who have agreed to be involved, but only once they have seen the finished product, due to the context. The Exhibition will give all the artists, musicians, creators and people involved  within the production to show their work, their abilities, and to also give them an opportunity to gain more work through this event. Each shall have their own table to show and discuss their creative history, their contribution to the film, their process and future ambitions to the visitors of the event. Funding.
Any help given financially to create this piece will be hugely appreciated in so many ways; it'll result in me being able to produce a film of higher quality, creativity and will grant me the chance to fully show my capabilities within this region of artistry. The money is needed for a range of reasons; we want to create the most high-quality film possible, and unfortunately, this takes both time and money. Props, makeup, sources, travel expenses and everything in-between add up quickly. We have, however, planned and budgeted a basic sum of £2,200 to cover travel, crew, food, costumes and makeup, festival entry fees and to organize our Exhibition piece.Please note, I am wanting to pay people within the production for their materials used, and also their time; you can't buy bread or pay your rent with 'exposure', so why not have both? I, however, obviously, will not be getting any money personally from my work on the production. 

Being a student film, and also wanting to pay people for their times and talents, every penny is going towards not only the creation of ‘Pulse’, but also financial recognition of peoples combined and individual efforts within the production.If we do not reach our entire goal, the money will be spent in the most practical ways, towards both the production and with the crew; props are a key aspect within our production, just as much as it is supplying our crew with the tools they need to create and do what they have to do.  As a result, the money will be budgeted to the best way we can manage.
Overall, this film is not just a film to any of the crew; it’s an opportunity to be expressive creatively and artistically. Its giving people who are passionate and talented within their fields a rare chance to express themselves and create things that would otherwise not see the light of day. It will give me and them both the platform to expand their portfolio in a positive sense, and open opportunity’s for our creative future. 
Risks & ChallengesLike anything to do with film,  creativity and life in general - Nothing goes according to plan. Things mess up, plans a scuppered, the weather lets you down and so do people. However, with Pulse having such a variety of people, places and narratives involved, even if 50% went wrong (which it won't!) I will still possess enough footage to create an equally unique, beautiful and enticing film. Its gonna be good! :)  
Other Ways You Can HelpIf you aren't in a position to donate, if you could please spread the word, share it with your family and friends and help us drum up interest, we would all be so grateful. This is an awesome opportunity for all of us involved and we want to create something truly unique and exciting. Thank you so much, from all of us! Thank you so much in advance for your help and contribution. Arwen Hawley-Brandt",29.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<p>My name is June Mugo, I am a young filmmaker from Jersey City, New Jersey. I moved to Maryland after I graduated from college. During my undergrad, I studied Sociology and Psychology because I knew one day, I wanted to educate people. I have a sharp eye for creativity, and captivating people's interest in what I am showcasing. </p>
<p>During my time in school, two of my closest friends had schizophrenia, and you can see people did not understand and feared the truth of understanding what was happening. Four years later, I got the urge to write about it. Not their stories in particular but the rest of the people around the world who have been silenced by their mental disorder.</p>
<p>This campaign will help bring these stories to life and educate people. Many people believe they have to step into a class and learn or experience it themselves. But my film will give the feeling of ""wow, how can I learn more?"" This campaign will give the opportunity of allowing this project to spread its wings into more hands and capture a remarkable motion picture.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it costs to deliver such a invaluable message. I have invested in myself and would be highly appreciative to receive help because it is not easy! Camera gear and the right people to make this great are not cheap, but you want the project to be great so of course it can't be cheap!</p>
<p>The total cost is $15,000. This covers the best equipment, the valuable team members passionate about the topic, donation to food donors, place to stay, food, and the actors.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal is to submit this project to some of the best film festivals (nationally and internationally) and distributors known today, which will result in about thousands maybe millions of viewers. Having your name on the big screen as a contributor would be breathtaking! Contributing to such a beautiful project, possibly going to some of the festivals! But in order to win and get the film into festivals, it has to have a compelling story (which I have) and has to be visually appealing. Some distributors require certain cameras to be used. These cameras cost between $500-$5000 to rent. But the end result is invaluable! Your favorite film was shot in these cameras!</p>
<p>My last film was low budget but I made the best of it. I was able to bring in the best people to do the project, great mentors and it made it into a couple festivals. With a bigger budget people will be motivated to help the project, the right equipment can be used and it will qualify to be in the top festivals and distributing companies around the world.</p>
<p>After my first project I learned I was not missing the right actors or camera people, it was the funding. Although I was able to figure it out by using cheaper gear, this time I want to go above and beyond. I have learned lessons, took classes and I am ready to make this project worth the investment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Please contribute to the great cause, tell your friends and use the Indiegogo share tools to spread the word. A thank you isn't enough but I will say a great end result will make you feel proud.</p>

With a bigger budget people will be motivated to help the project, the right equipment can be used and it will qualify to be in the top festivals and distributing companies around the world.
After my first project I learned I was not missing the right actors or camera people, it was the funding. Although I was able to figure it out by using cheaper gear, this time I want to go above and beyond. I have learned lessons, took classes and I am ready to make this project worth the investment.
 
Please contribute to the great cause, tell your friends and use the Indiegogo share tools to spread the word. A thank you isn't enough but I will say a great end result will make you feel proud.
 
Thank you,

<h3>The Film</h3>
<p>Scarlett doesn't play by the rules. She wasn't raised like the rest of us, being forced to move from city to city, hotel to hotel. She's a dangerous girl, and crossing paths with her could destroy you. But what happens when a girl like her falls in love?</p>
<h3><strong>What We Need</strong></h3>
<p>Our goal is to raise at least $7,000. We're half way through filming and need to raise money for additional costs for cast and crew, food, locations, legal, post-production, film festival submission costs, press-kits for the festivals, etc.</p>
<h3><strong>Human-Trafficking </strong></h3>
<p>The story was based off of real life stories of people who have been forced into and suffered through the unseen reality of human trafficking. We'll be interviewing some of these girls. Their stories need to be heard. It's a terrible aspect of our society and needs to be stopped.</p>
<h3><strong>We Need Your Help</strong></h3>
<p>PrettyBabyBeautiful is a jumping off point for many of the cast and crew involved in this film. We hope it will be a platform for launching our careers forwards as actors and filmmakers.</p>

It explores grief, betrayal, and evil with a western tinge...like David Lynch's BLUE VELVET by way of Ana Lily Amirpour. We’ll be filming in June and July 2018 over eight days in Saratoga, Texas and Austin, Texas. We have all the necessities mapped out and <strong>all we need is your help.</strong></p><p><strong>We need to raise $5,500 to create this feature-length film</strong> from pre-production to post and beyond. We know we’re asking the best people to help us reach our goal. Donate if you’re passionate about movies, if you love Texas filmmakers, or if you just want to be involved in the filmmaking world in a meaningful way. In exchange, we’re offering perks like featured titles in our film, the complete soundtrack, behind-the-scenes exclusive content, and, of course, an advanced digital copy of the finished work.</p><p><strong>Your contribution goes a long way in helping us to build this world and bring this movie to life. </strong>Further, your involvement helps independent filmmaking continue to thrive.

</h2><p><strong>WHAT IS WOLFROY?</strong><br/>WOLFROY is a feature-length film about what’s lurking beneath the surface. A married couple dealing with tragedy slowly begins to spiral out of control as grief and distrust build between them, all the while the small Texas town they live in begins to reveal a more sinister force that threatens their very lives.</p><p>Director Randall La Rue explains: “I was going through a personal crisis and everything I had come to rely on was gone in a matter of months…As I started to deconstruct the first 30 years of my life, I had to face some harsh truths about the mistakes I had made. Out of that process, the story of WOLFROY emerged. It's a complicated story of grief and the tragedy that results from selfish decisions, however small or insignificant they may be.”</p><p>WOLFROY is a highly visual story. While our previous work, SARATOGA LIGHTS, was stylized by the way things were said, WOLFROY is all about what’s in between the words. Our mission is to create something visually and emotionally striking that explores the human condition in tragic circumstances. We believe we have the cast, crew, locations, and story to do just that.</p><p><strong>WHAT IS SARATOGA?</strong><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1519505937/olgnvet3yepmjqs2726o.png"" src=""""/></strong></p><p>Saratoga, Texas (population 1,146) is the location of our film both on screen and off. It is as much of a character in WOLFROY as the people who inhabit it.</p><p>A town of boom and bust, Saratoga started as the community of New Sour Lake. Originally touted as the location of a medicinal spring similar to that of Saratoga Springs, NY, the town didn't find commercial success until 1901 when the first large-scale drilling began for oil. Rife with oil and timber, a railway connection gave Saratoga room to flourish.</p><p>The spaces we've found in and on the outskirts of this rural Texas town enhance a feeling of isolation. The Big Thicket National Preserve and Bragg Road (aka the ""Ghost Road"") lend an atmosphere of otherworldly beings, caution, and small-town whispers.</p><p><strong>The Big Thicket National Preserve</strong><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1517537532/odvoudjobkjg34sgu02u.png"" src=""""/><br/>Described as one of the most biodiverse areas in the world outside of the tropics. It was established in 1974 and it, along with Big Cypress National Preserve, was one of the first national preserves to be created in the United States.</p><p>Our characters spend time within these trees; dense forest and more than 97,000 acres of land encompass them as they try to escape their circumstances. Mounting uncertainty of what’s lurking in the shadows of the leaves add to the paranoia and intensity and forces action into small spaces where our characters come directly into contact with their fears.</p><p><strong>Bragg Road, or “The Ghost Road”</strong><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1518385730/si5qavxpx5gkkcewvuts.png"" src=""""/><br/>Bragg Road or ""The Ghost Road"" in Saratoga, Texas has become the subject of folk tales from locals and travelers alike. The former railroad bed is now a gravel road that stretches straight down for 8 miles, covered by trees on both sides that create a canopy overhead.</p><p>Otherworldly lights appear at night on this lonely road in Hardin County and many call the area haunted. There are numerous stories to explain these mysterious lights. A local favorite is that of a railroad worker who lost his head to a passing train - they say that the lights are his lantern in the night, a gleaming beacon to those among the living, as he walks the road seeking revenge and hoping to find his missing head.</p><p><strong>WHAT IS ACCOMPLISHED?</strong><br/>With WOLFROY, we’re settling back into the haunted western landscape we love so much for another cinematic brush with supernatural forces and cruel circumstance.</p><p>With every shoot we do, we evolve and learn more as a storytellers and filmmakers. This shoot will be no different. For WOLFROY we’ve come prepared. We've upgraded our gear and have been hard at work planning every move. We have locations, cast &amp; crew, filming dates, and budget already set. Now all we need to do is start!</p><p>The beauty of our process is that our crew has worked together on prior films. We know each other well and together we’ve created beautiful content over 6 years. We've learned what works and what doesn't and hope to push our boundaries in this film.  With help from financial backers, we can make an amazing piece of film.</p><h2>THE PEOPLE</h2><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1519925499/cfdpn1b3gdg23g20lpfi.png"" src=""""/><br/><strong>KOLBE RICKS as BONNIE</strong><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1519925510/lya2dh96fghcfwc4g5gv.png"" src=""""/><br/><strong>SPENCER GREENWOOD as SANFORD</strong><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1519925617/e6cew1gecmqvojf3lii1.png"" src=""""/><br/><strong>SAIGE HILTON as PATRICIA </strong><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1519925648/ogeocjecwu8iatliulhn.png"" src=""""/><br/><strong>MATTHEW DAVID RUDD as NATHAN</strong></p><p><strong>ABOUT DTD</strong><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1517537516/eew0j99y64n9wcinhgru.png"" src=""""/><br/>DTD is a collection of independent filmmakers and storytellers.

It explores grief, betrayal, and evil with a western tinge...like David Lynch's BLUE VELVET by way of Ana Lily Amirpour. We’ll be filming in June and July 2018 over eight days in Saratoga, Texas and Austin, Texas.

WHAT IS WOLFROY?WOLFROY is a feature-length film about what’s lurking beneath the surface. A married couple dealing with tragedy slowly begins to spiral out of control as grief and distrust build between them, all the while the small Texas town they live in begins to reveal a more sinister force that threatens their very lives.Director Randall La Rue explains: “I was going through a personal crisis and everything I had come to rely on was gone in a matter of months…As I started to deconstruct the first 30 years of my life, I had to face some harsh truths about the mistakes I had made. Out of that process, the story of WOLFROY emerged. It's a complicated story of grief and the tragedy that results from selfish decisions, however small or insignificant they may be.”WOLFROY is a highly visual story. While our previous work, SARATOGA LIGHTS, was stylized by the way things were said, WOLFROY is all about what’s in between the words. Our mission is to create something visually and emotionally striking that explores the human condition in tragic circumstances. We believe we have the cast, crew, locations, and story to do just that.WHAT IS SARATOGA?Saratoga, Texas (population 1,146) is the location of our film both on screen and off. It is as much of a character in WOLFROY as the people who inhabit it.A town of boom and bust, Saratoga started as the community of New Sour Lake. Originally touted as the location of a medicinal spring similar to that of Saratoga Springs, NY, the town didn't find commercial success until 1901 when the first large-scale drilling began for oil. Rife with oil and timber, a railway connection gave Saratoga room to flourish.The spaces we've found in and on the outskirts of this rural Texas town enhance a feeling of isolation. The Big Thicket National Preserve and Bragg Road (aka the ""Ghost Road"") lend an atmosphere of otherworldly beings, caution, and small-town whispers.The Big Thicket National PreserveDescribed as one of the most biodiverse areas in the world outside of the tropics. It was established in 1974 and it, along with Big Cypress National Preserve, was one of the first national preserves to be created in the United States.Our characters spend time within these trees; dense forest and more than 97,000 acres of land encompass them as they try to escape their circumstances. Mounting uncertainty of what’s lurking in the shadows of the leaves add to the paranoia and intensity and forces action into small spaces where our characters come directly into contact with their fears.Bragg Road, or “The Ghost Road”Bragg Road or ""The Ghost Road"" in Saratoga, Texas has become the subject of folk tales from locals and travelers alike. The former railroad bed is now a gravel road that stretches straight down for 8 miles, covered by trees on both sides that create a canopy overhead.Otherworldly lights appear at night on this lonely road in Hardin County and many call the area haunted. There are numerous stories to explain these mysterious lights. A local favorite is that of a railroad worker who lost his head to a passing train - they say that the lights are his lantern in the night, a gleaming beacon to those among the living, as he walks the road seeking revenge and hoping to find his missing head.WHAT IS ACCOMPLISHED?With WOLFROY, we’re settling back into the haunted western landscape we love so much for another cinematic brush with supernatural forces and cruel circumstance.With every shoot we do, we evolve and learn more as a storytellers and filmmakers. This shoot will be no different. For WOLFROY we’ve come prepared. We've upgraded our gear and have been hard at work planning every move. We have locations, cast & crew, filming dates, and budget already set. Now all we need to do is start!The beauty of our process is that our crew has worked together on prior films. We know each other well and together we’ve created beautiful content over 6 years. We've learned what works and what doesn't and hope to push our boundaries in this film.  With help from financial backers, we can make an amazing piece of film.THE PEOPLEKOLBE RICKS as BONNIESPENCER GREENWOOD as SANFORDSAIGE HILTON as PATRICIA MATTHEW DAVID RUDD as NATHANABOUT DTDDTD is a collection of independent filmmakers and storytellers.

<p><strong>SYNOPSIS:</strong> It's a beautiful late New England fall day when two International College Students go missing on an afternoon jog. The general consensus by local law enforcement is they ran into dangerous wild life as Black Bears roam the surrounding forests. Meanwhile two yuppies venture off into a nearby rural community adjacent to where the joggers have gone missing. As they realize something is off center, they soonly discover that there has been an explosion at the nearby RUSSELTOWN NUCLEAR POWER PLANT. After encountering several disfigured people who seem to have an acquired taste for human limbs and brains. They have concluded that the Power Plant employees have been infected by the immediate blast through radiation and other townspeople as well. Therefore they must fight off thousands of flesh eating zombies and avoid radioactive materials that are now airborne in order to live another day.  </p>

OFFICIAL MOVIE POSTER

SWOT ANALYSIS

Strengths: We have an experienced cast and crew along with a well known Starlett in Kendra Lust who currently has millions of fans worldwide. Not to mention we have an amazing script written by a brilliant screen writer who placed high in the Nicholl Fellowship.  
Weaknesses: Some may say that the Zombie genre is dying down, however we disagree and look at that opinion as a strength. The reasoning is some Zombie shows have lost their edge and creativity, it time to start fresh with a new storyline. 
Opportunities: This can be the next great zombie Franchise as Distribution is secured through Amazon Direct Video, self released DVD's, and other Online Streaming Opportunities such as ROKU Streaming Channels and APPLE TV. 



Threats: A highly saturated zombie genre market, however competition raises the bar on quality. Which is why we are having this campaign. We just do not want to make another zombie movie. We want to make a legendary cult classic!!!

<h3><strong>ENGRAM</strong></h3>
<p><a href=""http://www.engram-film.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.engram-film.com</a></p>
<p><i>On 11.VI.2247 the transit of Venus took place in front of the sun's disk. This rare astronomical phenomenon was thought to herald the end of the current world. Believing in the impending catastrophe, people fell into madness and excess, taking their own lives and fighting a war that claimed billions of victims, leaving desolation in its wake. However, the apocalyptic prophecy did not come true, and man survived.</i></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>SYNOPSIS</strong></h3>
<p>The former Polish-Russian border in a decaying Europe. Geographic boundaries have been obliterated, and traces of war - like a stain - are reflected in the fragile identities of the surviving humans. The illusory beauty of the landscape opens its raw image - a picture whose frame deteriorates, rots, breaks into pieces. This fragmentation is reflected in minimalistic pictures of intimate relationships, showing a human being who - like an animal - on a leash, in a muzzle, in a cage of his own fear - can no longer come close to another.  It is too late for any deed, and the dignity lost cannot be regained. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>DIRECTOR'S NOTE</strong></h3>
<p>In these times, we are immersed in the dark reality of inarticulate fear that leaves behind moral havoc, alienation and insensitivity to the events of the present. ENGRAM is the reverse of this reality - it is its reflection - an attempt to look at the sources and effects of this fear.</p>
<p>The film in its totality refers to the issues of guilt, forgiveness and responsibility for moral choices seen through the prism of a wound that is so old, so deep and so painful that it has become impossible to heal.</p>
<p>Based on the inner dynamics of borderline situations, ENGRAM will oscillate in its form between onirism and brutality, beauty and ugliness, dream and naturalistic cruelty.</p>
<p>Between splintered glances, we see what one is not allowed to look at. Between broken words, we speak of what has been consumed by silence. Tragedy is inevitable, so let the ode to INJUSTICE be chanted! Because <i>there is no punishment for sin or reward for virtue</i>.  Therefore, M. asks: <i>Does it matter who is guilty if there is no one who can judge?</i></p>

She works Monday-Saturday at her local supermarket and spends her Sundays with her parents who are elderly. She’s an only child and has no children of her own. When Velma was 2 years old, she was abducted. After 7 months, her uncle Sam returned her to her home. Sam claimed the £50,000 reward money from an anonymous beneficiary; he also claimed to have found Velma wandering the streets alone. To this day, Velma has never spoken about the event. When Sam died recently, it triggered something in her that sent her down a road of mania. She stopped showing up for work and stopped visiting her parents. And a week or so after the death of Sam, she abducted a two year old girl named Charlotte. Velma then held Charlotte in the same shipping container in which she had been kept.

Dudley appeared in Rihanna’s sensational music video We Found Love. Since then, he has starred in films such as White Color Black, The Spoiler and the hit British TV show Topboy. Dudley’s strength, sensibility and quirkiness will work wonderfully in the role of Vincent.Actress to play Velma TBCCharactersVelma: (40s) lives a routine life alone. She works Monday-Saturday at her local supermarket and spends her Sundays with her parents who are elderly. She’s an only child and has no children of her own. When Velma was 2 years old, she was abducted. After 7 months, her uncle Sam returned her to her home. Sam claimed the £50,000 reward money from an anonymous beneficiary; he also claimed to have found Velma wandering the streets alone. To this day, Velma has never spoken about the event. When Sam died recently, it triggered something in her that sent her down a road of mania. She stopped showing up for work and stopped visiting her parents. And a week or so after the death of Sam, she abducted a two year old girl named Charlotte. Velma then held Charlotte in the same shipping container in which she had been kept. In this moment when our story finds her, Velma’s mental state and subsequent actions are unpredictable. She’s erratic, cold, harsh, and, at the same time, very sensitive and vulnerable.Vincent: (30s) is a police detective inspector. He achieved the title of this role at a young age by being very hard working and talented. Vincent prides himself on his unique ability to see things in a way that other detectives cannot. His unusual and sometimes slightly bizarre tactics result in him being an outsider. Vincent grew up in a busy household with his mother and three brothers; he is the second youngest. His father went back to Africa when Vincent was just a boy and has never returned. Vincent spent most of his childhood with his grandfather, soaking up old wisdom. When Vincent’s grandfather died, he began looking at things differently. Since then, he has solved every case that has been assigned to him. Vincent is bold, strong and introverted. He carries a very calm and controlled demeanor but can explode at any moment. There is no limit to where he will go to solve a case.Budget

<p>For as long as we’ve been telling scary stories we have always known that the light is what saves us; that no matter what happens if we just turn on the lamp will be safe from whatever lies in the dark. But what happens when you turn on the lights and the monster is still there? Logan is a simple college boy who has been thrust into an apocalyptic world overrun by monsters with no way to contact his family or friends. A curfew has been sent over the town that he lives in, as the monsters are only visible in direct light. Although Logan plays it safe, one night the lights in his home go out and the monsters use this as an opportunity to attack. Using only a hand flashlight, Logan must escape his predators that lie in the darkness. Luckily for Logan, these creatures don’t have very good eyesight in the dark much like humans so he can escape... As long as he’s quick, quiet, and stays in the light.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>As I said, anything and everything you donate will go straight to the film. We are preparing preproduction for the next several months and so the IndieGoGo is being opened now in order to get us on the track we need. The funds go in several different places, but mostly are aimed towards the prop and costume team on the film who are making our lovely monster. The funds also are geared towards providing food for the cast and crew, and even for helping us submit this film to festivals in the future.</p>

<p>Dr. Karen Lentz doesn't know if she can ever be the same. A successful clinician and author, she struggles to make it through her morning routine, let alone the task of writing her upcoming book, a deadline that now seems meaningless. </p>
<p>On the surface, one might say it's because the love of her life passed six months ago to the day. It also happens to be her 65th birthday. As she contends with the option of ending it all, her relationship to Tuolumne bubbles to the surface, and the depth of her connection to this storied wilderness is able to pull her back from the brink. </p>
<p>This poignant, slice-of-life narrative shows how though loss can be terrifying, so is staring down the third act of life without the purpose you held onto for so long. Told through the eyes of a woman whose independence hangs in the balance, yet finds the power to stand on her own two feet once more. </p>

<p>Our intent is simple: use this story to touch on transparent, yet powerful messages. Loss, grief, and change are realities every human experiences, and the conduit through which we see this - Karen - is the reason we agree this story needs to be told now. The perspective of women over age sixty remains a story essentially untold in narrative film, and ageism (particularly when it comes to leading roles), continues to a be a hurdle of representation we’ve yet to overcome.</p>
<p>In 2017, the University of Southern California's Annenberg School for Communication published ""Over Sixty, Underestimated"" looking at age and representation in Best Picture Oscar nominees. Out of 1,256 speaking roles, only 148 were characters sixty years of age or over, with men accounting for 3.5 of those roles to every 1 female role.

</div></div>","Dr. Karen Lentz doesn't know if she can ever be the same. A successful clinician and author, she struggles to make it through her morning routine, let alone the task of writing her upcoming book, a deadline that now seems meaningless. 
On the surface, one might say it's because the love of her life passed six months ago to the day. It also happens to be her 65th birthday. As she contends with the option of ending it all, her relationship to Tuolumne bubbles to the surface, and the depth of her connection to this storied wilderness is able to pull her back from the brink. 
This poignant, slice-of-life narrative shows how though loss can be terrifying, so is staring down the third act of life without the purpose you held onto for so long. Told through the eyes of a woman whose independence hangs in the balance, yet finds the power to stand on her own two feet once more.

Alejandro Echevarria - Co-Director

Alejandro Echevarria is an independent filmmaker and freelance cameraman from Los Angeles. His short film, “Illusory Promises,” which stars Kristen Joy Bjorge, has received awards from the Los Angeles Reel Film Festival for Best Cinematography (DP: Erick Aguilar) and Best Short Narrative Film, in addition to screening as an Official Selection at NewFilmmakers Los Angeles, and the Independent Filmmakers Showcase (IFS).
He has worked in camera department in a broad range of capacities, including for television, broadcast news, feature-length concerts, commercials, music videos, Netflix original content and short films.
In his spare time, he enjoys playing ragtime piano.
Allen Chodakowski - Cinematographer

Allen Chodakowski is a cinematographer and camera operator who specializes in narrative motion pictures.
He moved out of Chicago six years ago after graduating from Columbia College’s film program, where he had the opportunity to shoot on 16mm and 35mm film. Upon graduating, he moved to LA and began working as a camera assistant. Since then he has shot short films, commercials and music videos. His short film “A Good Brother,” won Best Picture and Best Noir at the New York Film Awards and Best Film Noir at the Los Angeles Film Awards.
When stepping off set he spends his time cooking, watching movies and playing drums.


We anticipate around seventy percent of any funds received would go directly to production needs, including hiring a producer, permits, paying our crew and our actress, transportation, lodging and food for crew and talent, insurance, as well as any union fees. 
Our $50k goal also encompasses all post-production costs, including editing, sound design, hiring a composer, marketing, and festival fees. A thorough creative process throughout post is vital to making this film land. While we don’t want to rush ourselves, reaching our goal will help ensure we get through post efficiently without having to wait too long on any given process.
Below is a photo of our budget top sheet. Our full line item budget is also linked below. 
We are aiming to film Fall 2019, with post-production completed in time for Summer 2020 festival submissions.

Our intent is simple: use this story to touch on transparent, yet powerful messages. Loss, grief, and change are realities every human experiences, and the conduit through which we see this - Karen - is the reason we agree this story needs to be told now. The perspective of women over age sixty remains a story essentially untold in narrative film, and ageism (particularly when it comes to leading roles), continues to a be a hurdle of representation we’ve yet to overcome.
In 2017, the University of Southern California's Annenberg School for Communication published ""Over Sixty, Underestimated"" looking at age and representation in Best Picture Oscar nominees. Out of 1,256 speaking roles, only 148 were characters sixty years of age or over, with men accounting for 3.5 of those roles to every 1 female role. An earlier study also found that women over 40 only make up 21.4% of female roles, compared to 78.6% for men. 
Obviously, these numbers are not great.
It is so important to have older women be seen. Their wisdom, complexities, flaws, and beauty are unlike anything else on this planet. To grow old is at once a privilege and a certainty, and when we fail to fully represent this in the media, we erase a season of life that is so intricate and so important.  


Filming in a place of immense natural beauty, such as Tuolumne Meadows in Yosemite National Park, provides an illustrative background for us to bring this story to life. 
Nevertheless, it does come with its challenges, including the element of unknown (weather, etc), as well as paying for necessary permits that will allow us to film on this invaluable terrain. 
We are committed to the utmost integrity in telling this story, which includes respecting the land where filming will occur, working in cooperation with all Rangers and National Park staff as they ensure the well-being of both the park and the safety of our production. We have constructed our story in such a way as to not film in any conservation areas, ensuring we leave a small footprint and secure our permits, yet still remain true to the relationship between Karen and Tuolumne. 
We are ready and prepared for the journey of filming in Yosemite, knowing the story's relevance and the film's visual excellence will stand out in no small part due to the magnificence of the setting.

<h3>Filmmakers Statement </h3>
<p>My name is Clare McCann and I was raised believing in magic, and would love to share that magic with you. Journey with me into the forest and be a part of creating wonder.</p>
<p>Five years ago, I left a corporate creative director role at The Star Casino. During my tenure, I produced and designed countless shows and creative productions, working with international celebrities and companies. I was driven however to move on and create something more meaningful and enthralling.</p>
<p>After humbly returning to university at the age of 25 to further my studies, I began working towards creating my own medieval productions. It has been a 5-year journey, working tirelessly on screenplays and self-funded film productions. </p>
<p>After completing my directorial debut award-winning feature film Benefited this year, I am finally ready for the next step; creating a medieval short film. ‘Into the Forest’ will be used to help pitch my teams’ capabilities in this genre, towards the goal of having one of my larger pre-written medieval features or TV series fully funded and released on a larger scale. Securing paid work for my team and I, after all the years of volunteering and preparation, will be more than a dream come true…it will open the doors to the next stage of our professional and creative lives. And we would love your help in bringing our vision to life.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am asking you, dear reader, to help us reach our fundraising goal of $2,500.00. Achieving this along with our wonderful volunteer team will enable us to deliver an outstanding, quality-laden short film by mixing together all the best ingredients - from state-of-the-art camera, lighting and sound hire, glorious and authentic costumes, special effects equipment to scrumdidiliumptions catering for all our amazing volunteers. </p>
<p>If you can help by donating to our production, you’ll have the enjoyment of being one of the first to see the finished film, and the satisfaction and pride in being publicly credited as an investor in the film. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>An important aspect of our film production we are proud to note is a balanced number of male and female crew members. Cherry Productions is a passionate supporter of women in film, avidly working to create a safer and more welcoming film-making industry for women. </p>
<p>We have originated multiple productions focused on women and women’s issues. Our latest film, the multi award-winning ‘Benefited’, has been selected to screen its international Premiere at the Women’s International Film &amp; Arts Festival in New York. ‘Benefited’ brings needed attention to the ramifications of domestic violence, and the lack of safe housing support available for women and children trying to escape dangerous circumstances.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our production team have demonstrated experience making films with nothing but a catering budget, by leveraging Director Clare McCanns’ extensive history in costume and set design and the generous nature of our team members. We have assembled a fantastic team of highly trained, experienced and enthusiastic professionals for this medieval short, who are all fully committed to seeing it come to life.</p>
<p>What we need now are the funds to hire top-of-line equipment to allow us to craft a screen experience any Game of Thrones and Hobbit fan would be delighted to watch.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>A financial investment - no matter how small - will help deliver our ambitions for this project, and create an amazing addition to the medieval film genre. We do understand that not everyone is in a position to help us with a financial investment. If this is the case, please share this fundraising campaigns a few times with your friends and networks, to help us connect with a wider audience of potential investors.</p>

Risks & Challenges
 With IADT supplying a trained COVID Officer, we will ensure there will be continuous assessments of the risks involved with shooting; with consistent reminders to crew to keep their distance where possible especially before and after breaks as well as during movements between setups/locations.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>About The Film</strong></h2>
<p>""To Me, With Love"" is a semi-fictional film about Jade, a 20-something writer, who moves back to her hometown of Flint, Michigan after living in New York for several years. Upon her return, she's met with a water crisis that's affecting half of the city's residents.</p>
<p>She also faces a personal crisis in the form of unresolved issues from strained family relationships and friendships. As Jade strives to love her home all over again and mend what's broken, she hopes she has enough drive to achieve her dream of becoming a successful writer.</p>
<p>The film will be shot in Flint and feature a cast and crew of Flint natives. A short clip was filmed in 2019 that can be seen above.</p>
<p>Production is scheduled to begin in mid-May 2020.</p>

<p>My name is Breona Johnson and I am a screenwriter/director that was born and raised in Flint, Michigan.</p>
<p>For as long as I can remember, I've had a love for film, and since I was 18 years-old, I've been involved in film in some form or fashion.

I was accepted into Columbia College Chicago for film, but couldn't attend due to financial reasons.</p>
<p>However, I sought out opportunities to shoot projects for creatives right in my hometown. Since then, I've shot numerous music videos, two short films and have been a behind-the-scenes videographer for multiple music artists.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>The Mission</strong></h2>
<p>My mission for ""To Me, With Love"" is to tell an overlooked story and to bring more awareness to social issues from a personal and intimate narrative. I love researching mental health and emotions, and consider myself an empath.</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p><i>THE LIFE OF MINE</i> is a musical-dramady feature-Length film about a young musician &amp; rapper, Allo, who has grown up in a close knit musical family along with his sister Mila.  One of his primary motivations is to always protect his sister and to keep their family close.  Allo discovers that his sister has started dating a new guy, and he is puzzled as to why it was kept as a secret from him.  When Allo finally meets him, he is shocked to discover that he is an unwelcomed character from his past.  Allo is then determined to not let this dude win under his watch….so the adventure begins!     </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The film is currently in production with about 80% of the scenes shot.  We have had 2 Advanced screenings of a rough version of the film and this was done to obtain  feedback from our target audience.  The screenings were a huge success!  We had overwhelmingly positive feedback from the audience.  One comment was that “the movie played like one of my favorite music CD’s”.  Another comment was that this type of content is refreshing and loaded with some amazing music"".   Of course there is still post production work needed including audio, color correction and color grading.  Help drive this project to completion by offering your support with getting these things done!</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Who we Are:</h3>
<p>The Life of Mine is the first feature length film by Art8 productions. Art8 Productions is a family owned freelance company with experience in the areas of Web Series, Comedy Skits, Short Films and Documentary style videos.  Our Team consist of people that have experience, knowledge, skills and talent gleaned from years of experience in entertainment primarily in the music and Film/TV areas. This has enabled us to be effective and perform a range of complex task with a small team. One of those tasks included shooting the Feature Length film “The Life of Mine“.  The film features a brother and sister duo (Jamila and Diallo Thompson) and tells a story about family, trials and triumphs through the Lens of Hip-hop and R&amp;B.</p>
<p><i>Company Goals</i>:</p>
<p>Our intentions are to provide entertainment that present positive messages about courage, intelligence, family and fun. We want to tell stories that follow African American youth thru adventures and Misadventures.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>WE CAN’T DO THIS ALONE!  The film won’t get finished without the aid of a talented cast and crew and equipment.  In addition, Post-Production and distribution also costs time and money.  Some of what we will raise will help to cover the costs of shooting the remaining scenes along with post production editing, scoring, color grading and starting distribution.  Of course, the amount that we are requesting will not cover all of these costs, but with your help we can complete the lions share of it.  We will cover the rest out of pocket.</p>

<h3>What's In It For You?</h3>
<p>Those that contribute will gain access to a wide variety of awesome perks!  Everything from shout outs, credits in the film, t-shirts, VIP screening/access to view the completed film, and many more!</p>
<p>The Life of Mine doesn’t get finished without the generous contributions from people like you, and we want to return the favor by offering a wide variety of perks for your help!</p>
