<p>I'm Normandie Wilson... I'm a singer, pianist, &amp; fashion plate from San Diego, California. My output is varied; over the past 8 years I've shared over a dozen independent releases of original material with the world... ranging from lo-fi indie-pop to instrumental piano... to more traditional vocal jazz &amp; lounge stylings. </p>
<p>My newest full-length album is called ""Normandie Wilson Is Tired of Being Nice"" and it's an exploration into new territory for me. (There's guitar on it) In all seriousness, this is a very new place for me to be... it's about concepts of anger, revenge, heartbreak, and what it means to name pain, to talk about our hurt. The record was produced in conjunction with the incredible David Fleminger and features many awesome San Diego musicians, along with contributions from Adam Marsland of Karma Frog Studios in LA. I am very proud of this piece of work, and the discussions that I hope to have with you regarding the creation of this album, along with honest and vulnerable communication around our valid feelings when we are wronged, hurt, or abused.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Where the Money Goes</h3> <p>I have an extensive back catalog of releases, many of which have never seen a proper pressing, or even a proper roll-out. Thanks to the generous support of my friends &amp; fans, I was able to press a 7"" record in 2010 and do pre-orders to support my last full-length release. Because of my last professionally pressed album, I was able to secure many gigs in San Diego &amp; beyond, which have paid for themselves costs several times over. </p>
<p>The first goal is to fund CD pressing of my newest album, ""Normandie Wilson Is Tired of Being Nice."" After that, I will work backwards in the catalog and press small quantities (100-500) of each release. A question I've heard a lot; ""Do artists even sell CDs anymore? Aren't they obsolete?"" For some artists, CDs are not a reliable tool, but they matter to me. At performances, CDs are still the number one way I earn extra money and connect with fans. (It's also worth mentioning that vinyl is super cool, but most vinyl releases need about 4-6 months for pressing, and I want to make sure anyone who wants a physical copy of the album can have one ASAP!) </p>
<p>Any funds raised over the goal will be used to make music videos for the latest record. My community has been so good to me, and I am so grateful for all the constant support you've given me through the years. Every contribution is so valuable to me, as I have no label support.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Honest Discussions About Our Emotions</h3> <p>It's my hope that the record facilitates discussion around valid emotional responses to pain, abuse, and trauma that we experience as a part of being alive, being human. I want to talk about anger. I want to talk about how we heal from these experiences. I am tired of ""being nice,"" I'm tired of stuffing down my emotions and my pain because it upsets other people. This is the most honest record I have ever made, and I want to share honestly with you, and listen to your stories also.</p>

<h3>My mom bought me an acoustic guitar and 10 guitar lessons for my 14th birthday. When I discovered punk rock a year later, I wrote my first song ""Friday Night At CBGBs"". It wasn't very good, but I kept going, knowing there were others out there like me that weren't held back by their limitations. A year later I was in my first band and I was lucky enough to eventually make a few records and do shows in the USA and Europe. I played with some great musicians and became friends with some wonderful, supportive people. I wouldn't have gotten very far without having them in my life. </h3>
<div>         I slowed down my musical activity after my last solo record ""Sin Cigarros"" was released on TAANG! In 1996. After 18 years away, I recorded a 9 song ep  ""Like The Kings We Were Meant To Be"" with the Gloucester band, Electric Ears. They helped me discover a renewed enthusiasm for playing music and brought new life to songs that have been kicking around unreleased for the last decade or more. I have 30 to 40 more unreleased songs and I want to record them.</div>

<div><br/></div> <h2><br/></h2> <ul> <li>I came to the figure of 3000.00 after evaluating the gear I felt was needed to make a warm sounding finished product. I lack most of the equipment you might find in a home studio. I use a ZOOM 16 track digital recorder, no name microphones (except 1 Shure mic from the 80s), a bass I bought for $50, cheap cymbals and I tape a couple of mics to guitar stands in place of real mic stands.

<h3>
<b>The Project:</b>
</h3>Hi!  My name is Evelyn Horan and I'm a singer/songwriter.  I've been hired to create the soundtrack and be the voice of the main character, Sophia, in an independent film called Pentimento written and directed by Loredana Gasparotto.  I'm so excited about this project because it's a whole new world of songwriting for me and I get to work with amazing, creative people throughout the process. As a contributor, your support will help make the soundtrack and EP for this amazing film possible!  The whole film is about Sophia's musical journey through love and life.  Without your help Sophia will remain silent.   <br/><br/><h3><b>Where your money will go:</b></h3>
<p><b></b>In order to create this inspirational soundtrack and EP I will need $1500 to help cover the costs of production, studio time, musicians (my lovely band mates and engineers), mixing and mastering, artwork, physical CDs, promotion and distribution.</p>
<p>I'm so excited about this project because it allows me to create music through a character that opens up another dimension of my creativity, so you'll get to hear (and see!) a different side to my music!  <br/></p>
<p>If I don't reach my entire goal, the funds will first go to pay those working with me as musicians and engineers (which will be a total of about $800) and then to studio time ($225) and then I would probably end up paying for artwork, physical CDs and promotion and distribution myself. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Why should you help?<br/>
</h3>
<p>This project means so much to me because it is the first time I've been hired to create a soundtrack and be the voice of a character in a movie!  How cool is that?  I've put so much time, thought and love into each of the songs I've written for Pentimento and I can't wait for you all to hear them.  Writing songs for and about others is always more cathartic to me because it allows empathy to flow from me freely through music.  <br/></p>
<p>Even just $1 helps go towards the awesome musicians and creative people I get to work with on this project and will allow this beautiful story to come to life on screen.  The whole movie is about the main character's life journey through music!  It is my honor and duty to create a soundtrack that will accompany her journey.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Challenges:<br/>
</h3>
<p>Since I've never created a soundtrack for a full movie before, there are many challenges I will be facing with this project that will probably result in more time and money spent perfecting it.  I will need to work with my team to create perfect in and out fading of songs to the scenes; each song will need to be personalized to every second of every scene and be shortened for each scene; I have to step out of my comfort zone and sing a song from a musical, which will take tons of practice; the main character is Romanian, so I'm trying my hardest to create a song that sounds Romanian and even has some parts sung in Romanian!  Even though these challenges are daunting, I can't wait to overcome them with practice, hard work, and creativity and I can't wait for you to hear the finished product.<br/></p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>You can help!<br/>
</h3>
<p>Even if donation is impossible for you at this moment, you can help just by sharing this project with others.  This film and project is so inspirational to me and I hope to see it soar and inspire others as well.  </p>

<p>We are a five piece band from western Prince Edward Island.  We had some songs put together and we laid them down live.  When we got them back we posted them up on our social network page and they took off.  So now we are on a mission to put an album together and that's why we turned to Indiegogo for help.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We need about $3000 for our project.  A big goal but not an unreachable goal.  That will pay for producing, mixing and printing our cd's.  We are not leaving all the work up to you the pledgers of course, any gigs we play will go directly to our album as well.  </p>
<p>We will be giving out some t-shirts and personal thank yous to our pledgers and some other options as well like local gigs, advanced copies, and more.  We will also send out videos to our pledgers and updates as well.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary Hi.  have you ever had a dream but it was always a little out of reach.  Well we have one and now you can help us reach our dream a little faster by pledging to our campaign.  
We are a five piece band from western Prince Edward Island.  We had some songs put together and we laid them down live.  When we got them back we posted them up on our social network page and they took off.  So now we are on a mission to put an album together and that's why we turned to Indiegogo for help.   What We Need & What You Get We need about $3000 for our project.  A big goal but not an unreachable goal.  That will pay for producing, mixing and printing our cd's.  We are not leaving all the work up to you the pledgers of course, any gigs we play will go directly to our album as well.  
We will be giving out some t-shirts and personal thank yous to our pledgers and some other options as well like local gigs, advanced copies, and more.  We will also send out videos to our pledgers and updates as well.
If we do not reach our goal, the cash will still go toward the album, we will just have to work harder and push the album back a little but we will still be going ahead with it as planned.
The Impact
 As stated before we are a five piece band.  One of us is a fisherman (Kevin), one is a mechanic (Danny), two carpenters (Jason and Jp) and one long haul trucker (Shawn).  We are simple guys working hard on all original tunes.  Kevin came up with some tunes and so did Danny and Jp.  We all work full time and we take time away from our families late at night to run through theses tunes and arrangements and they are actually sounding really great!  Our families are supporting us and we REALLY REALLY hope that you will too.   Risks & Challenges  We really hope that we have reached you and that you do help us out.  We all have been playing music for a long time.  Danny has been playing the bar scene for 17 years and Shawn almost the same amount.  Jp and Jason and Kevin have been playing music and singing for about 15 years themselves.  It's been a long road and now we all think that we deserve this little shot at making an album.  We all have busy schedules but we all have made the sacrifices to make it work.   Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help.  If you like our story and the funds aren't available, please share it to all your friends and family, they might be ably to help us out and if not them, they might know someone else.  Don't forget to share it on Facebook and Twitter and everywhere else.

<p></p></strong></h2><h2><strong>The A'tudes &amp; Brews Story</strong></h2><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Hello! My name is Carrie and I am a professional musician and the founder of this digital storytelling blog, A'tudes &amp; Brews. Back in the summer of August 2014, I was a music student starting the final year of my Masters degree and preparing to enter into the real world. While drinking my coffee one morning at school, I caught myself spiraling downwards into a very negative and depressed mentality. It wasn't an entirely new feeling, but I began to seriously question whether or not I had what it took, if I was good enough, if I had worked hard enough, and worst of all, I became obsessed over the question of whether or not I would ever be considered 'successful'.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">In an attempt to alleviate my own stress, I talked to close friends and relatives of mine and found that I was not as alone as I had imagined; more importantly, I discovered that these doubts were not unique to just musicians. These doubts are unique to being human, a side of ourselves we don't always pay attention to. Ultimately I realized I was confusing my value as a human being with achievements I may or may not have as a musician, and in this confusion was how I found myself shrouded in debilitating negativity, allowing it to consume me, dictate my life and how I expressed myself as an individual. As I talked to more and more people, I realized how deeply we collectively as a society are plagued by this epidemic, and I became inspired to promote social change. Thus, A'tudes &amp; Brews was born. </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">In music, an étude in its literal definition is “a composition designed to improve the technique of an instrumental performer by isolating specific difficulties” (The New Harvard Dictionary of Music). I of course don't disdain that études and other exercises like études are important to our professions, but overcoming other ""specific difficulties"" we endure, like debilitating negativity, certainly does not come from études. That is why I propose another adaptation of the word. A'tudes, unlike études, aim to improve upon our ability to adopt positive 'attitudes' towards life, and shift our collective conscious away from feeling that we go through it alone. In this project, I encourage musicians and non-musicians alike to practice being honest and open with their stories over a nice 'brew' of their choice that I will provide.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""></span></p><h2>How you can help!</h2><p></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">A'tudes &amp; Brews has many goals for itself, but in order to achieve them we really need your help! Currently this project is being entirely funded out-of-pocket, and unfortunately that means the goals we can realistically achieve at this time are severely limited.

<i>""I think A'tudes &amp; Brews is a great way to promote a sense of unity and care among musicians. By reading the interviews, we learn that behind every face we see at a gig is a story, often one suprisingly similar to our own. In an over-saturated market such as Los Angeles, a project like this is sorely needed. Often, even the most skilled musicians can feel like they're drowning in a sea of talent, and that their voice or craft is disposable. I feel that A'tudes &amp; Brews seeks to remedy that unavoidable feeling of alienation. The questions asked in the interview are great at pulling out deeper thoughts and more personal stories than one might not hear otherwise. I enjoyed my experience being interviewed and was honored to have been given the opportunity. Carrie is a great interviewer because she asks the right questions and listens carefully to the responses. Nothing about the process felt artificial, controlled, or forced like many interivews can. Carrie has done a great job making her subjects feel at ease and safe--creating an essential trust with the interviewee that allows them to answer more candidly.

<i>""I participated in Carrie's A'tudes &amp; Brews project in 2015 and had a wonderful time sharing my thoughts and perspective.

We can learn that the struggles and challenges often that we we are experiencing in our own journeys many not be as foreign as we think, and we also learn new viewpoints that perhaps we had never considered prior. I strongly believe that projects like Carrie's can act as cultural social agents in our modern society, in the arts community and beyond. When people share their individual beliefs and values, and others connect or resonate with those viewpoints it can strengthen confidence in their own trajectory, as well as learning how many lives are intertwined. In short, when you have a passion that you want to pursue and you hear others tell their stories of pursuing their careers, it helps make those pursuits more tangible and in turn strengthens confidence to take strides forward.

It is equally inspiring to read the other interviews to gain new perspectives, and I have been pleased to find that while all of us come from different backgrounds, in many cases we have shared experiences. In all cases, our passion for music is apparent through Carrie's excellent ability to create a relaxed interview environment, where interviewees feel comfortable to share their thoughts and stories openly. This platform could be tremendously valuable for musicians on a much larger scale, nationally and globally, if give the opportunity to expand.

</div>
<p><b>Short Summary</b></p>
<p>Hello to all. One day I jumped out of my bed thinking: ""what if I
create a project where all would feel engaged in their most high ideals?"".
And so I started, I designed a music project that could contain great
expectations of the future of mankind. And what better than an extraterrestrial
influence? A more civilized race that can give us the tecnology and ideals we
need to enhance our lifes. But let me introduce myself:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm a 30 year old man, I am an actor and a model
     and I have also done dubbing for Disney. My life goes well, and now I am
     even writting a book (for wich I'm also asking for a crowdfunding). I
     don't have a girlfriend but I'm passionate for a girl for a long time from
     now. </li>
<li>My campaign starts on the need to be active on
     certain concepts to the world (and I want it to be worldwide) and change
     minds that are lost and without belief in their trajectories. It's a
     matter of love and purpose that I want to share with the world. This is
     important to me for it is my beliefs that are at stake.</li>
<li>The help of you people out there will be
     magnanimous for it will be my concepts made come true for the world (and
     God, what I love you to listen to my songs right now...)Specially I
     believe my project is a contribution for the development of Mankind in
     General</li>
</ul>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You
Get</b></p>
<p>So now let me break it down for you folks, in more detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>I will need about 35.000€ to 40.000€! 15.000€ for
     the production of the album, 15.000€ for the marketing, image and
     communications; and 5.000-10.000€ for publicity and unpredicted expenses.
     Any more details I can give you in the future... </li>
<li>If you donate to my project I guarantee you
     special places in concerts, t-shirts autographed and CD's autographed. Want more? tell me about it!</li>
<li>Now, if I don't reach my entire goal the funds
     will go for the editing of my books that are also waiting for approval of
     crowdfunding. These books are about poetry on nature, love issues and
     spirituality; my lifestyle, political and filosophycal ideas. And, of
     course, I'll save the money to keep focused on my album!</li>
</ul>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>Please Go to myspace and look for Helio Lopes Pestana, there is my music.
You will get a closer look. The difference your contribution will make is the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>With my project you will feel the difference in
     your heart and in your mind on what is still needed on Earth to be
     developed. You will flow through the rivers of paradise of sound and the
     world will follow you.</li>
<li>The last thing I want you to think is that this
     is all fake. Trust me, it is possible to change the world into a more
     developed place. </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>Now I may face risks and obstacles. Not all is possible and to change minds
is a long and pacient process. The sugestion of ideas through music is but a
start, then people need to cultivate them in their own lives. If they don't,
then music is a looser process. I think I can win in this battle:</p>
<ul>

<p></p></div>","Short Summary
Hello to all. One day I jumped out of my bed thinking: ""what if I
create a project where all would feel engaged in their most high ideals?"".
And so I started, I designed a music project that could contain great
expectations of the future of mankind. And what better than an extraterrestrial
influence? A more civilized race that can give us the tecnology and ideals we
need to enhance our lifes. But let me introduce myself:

I'm a 30 year old man, I am an actor and a model
     and I have also done dubbing for Disney. My life goes well, and now I am
     even writting a book (for wich I'm also asking for a crowdfunding). I
     don't have a girlfriend but I'm passionate for a girl for a long time from
     now. 
My campaign starts on the need to be active on
     certain concepts to the world (and I want it to be worldwide) and change
     minds that are lost and without belief in their trajectories. It's a
     matter of love and purpose that I want to share with the world. This is
     important to me for it is my beliefs that are at stake.
The help of you people out there will be
     magnanimous for it will be my concepts made come true for the world (and
     God, what I love you to listen to my songs right now...)Specially I
     believe my project is a contribution for the development of Mankind in
     General

What We Need & What You
Get
So now let me break it down for you folks, in more detail:

I will need about 35.000€ to 40.000€! 15.000€ for
     the production of the album, 15.000€ for the marketing, image and
     communications; and 5.000-10.000€ for publicity and unpredicted expenses.
     Any more details I can give you in the future... 
If you donate to my project I guarantee you
     special places in concerts, t-shirts autographed and CD's autographed. Want more? tell me about it!
Now, if I don't reach my entire goal the funds
     will go for the editing of my books that are also waiting for approval of
     crowdfunding. These books are about poetry on nature, love issues and
     spirituality; my lifestyle, political and filosophycal ideas. And, of
     course, I'll save the money to keep focused on my album!

The Impact
Please Go to myspace and look for Helio Lopes Pestana, there is my music.
You will get a closer look. The difference your contribution will make is the
following:

With my project you will feel the difference in
     your heart and in your mind on what is still needed on Earth to be
     developed. You will flow through the rivers of paradise of sound and the
     world will follow you.
The last thing I want you to think is that this
     is all fake. Trust me, it is possible to change the world into a more
     developed place. 

Risks & Challenges
Now I may face risks and obstacles. Not all is possible and to change minds
is a long and pacient process. The sugestion of ideas through music is but a
start, then people need to cultivate them in their own lives. If they don't,
then music is a looser process. I think I can win in this battle:

My lyrics are soft and are about my life
     experience to let the listener know more calmly on what is more urgent to
     be treated in the heart of humanity. 
My sounds will be of future like. So I expect it
     to seduce the market.

Other Ways You Can Help
Wait, I do understand if yu cannot contribute with money to my project but
there is still something you can do:

get the word out and make some noise about my
     campaign.
use the Indiegogo share tools!

And that's all there is to it!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>For many people with Relapsing/Remitting (RR) MS, it is a
relatively mild condition, which progresses slowly, and becomes debilitating
only after many years/decades.  This
wasn’t the case for Faith, though…she won the worst lottery ever by being hit
by a very aggressive form of MS.  Within
just a few months of her diagnosis, she was first unable to walk on her own,
then unable to stand on her own, and finally unable to even get out of bed or
feed herself.</p>
<p>James was there for Faith through it all…as were some of the
most amazing friends, family, and fans that anyone could ask for!  People across North America gave their time,
encouragement, and even their money to get Faith the care and medication that
she needed.  It has taken several years,
but thanks to the hard work of so many great people – and some amazing doctors
and nurses -  Faith is finally on a
treatment which has brought her “back to life”…at least for now.</p>
<p>Faith’s treatment is temporary: she was told right off the
bat that she will only be on it for 2 years before the medication can cause an
infection in her brain (called PML) that is life-threatening.  At the 2 year mark, new treatment options
will have to be investigated…most of which do not hold the promise of being as
effective. Having started her current treatment 6 months ago, that leaves only
about 18 months of relative “normalcy” for Faith…and we intend to make that
time count by pursuing the one thing which has given our lives meaning: MUSIC.</p>
<p>Music has sustained us through all of the ups-and-downs,
both listening to it or performing it live (something which we had to stop
doing altogether for nearly a year, but are SO HAPPY to finally be able to do
again!!).  Most cathartic has been the
music which we started writing ourselves, both before Faith’s diagnosis but
especially throughout her/our ordeal. 
Our experiences – both shared and independent – have culminated in a
slew of original songs which run the gamut from angry to inspirational to just
plain fun!  And we’re determined to share
these songs with the world, and those who have gone (or are going through)
similar struggles in hopes that they draw strength from them.</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">First, let us clarify what we DON’T want to do: we </span><u style=""background-color: initial;"">do not</u><span style=""background-color: initial;"">
want to be “rockstars”…we don’t want to record a demo in order to land a
recording contract, and we don’t want to tour &amp; play shows 250 days of the
year to promote an album we’ve released. 
Even in relatively good health, this is not something which Faith can
manage, as the cumulative effects of her MS have already drained her energy…while
we will continue to perform live on occasion, the gruelling grind of a touring
musician is not a possibility for us.</span><br/></p>
<p>What we DO want is to write songs <i>for</i> artists who are already doing all of that…simply put, we want
to be SONGWRITERS (with an eye to landing a publishing contract in Nashville).  In addition to our passion for creating
music, songwriting is something which Faith <i>can</i>
continue to do even as her condition progresses.</p>
<p>We’re already well on our way to that goal…we have a dozen
strong original songs “ready to go”, we have an amazing agent and lawyer
representing us in the US, and we have strong connections – and real
opportunities – in the key market of Nashville, TN.  What we don’t have – and need – is a polished
studio recording of each of our songs, along with professional marketing
materials to promote ourselves. This is where you come in!</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1466554028/IMG_4998_j99rpk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>

THANKS!</p><p>You can also read my artist biography below.</p><p><b>Artist Bio:</b></p><p>Jehzan is a twenty-four year old emcee, spoken word poet, freelance journalist, and budding entrepreneur from Honolulu, HI. She runs her own website as well as her own Hip Hop blog, hosted on <a href=""http://www.JehzanExclusive.com."" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.JehzanExclusive.com.</a> </p><p>Jehzan credits most of her musical influence to 90s and 2000s Hip Hop and R&amp;B artists such as 2Pac, Eminem, Missy Elliot, Lauryn Hill, T-Pain, Akon, and Nelly. However, she is a big fan of many artists in the independent Hip Hop genre such as Blue Scholars, Bambu, Classified, Hopsin, Dizzy Wright, Pryde, and Snow Tha Product. While choosing not to categorize herself as a solely as a ""conscious"" rapper, the level of Jehzan's lyrical content narrated through a variety of beats and instrumentals is of high caliber. She brings unique style as a female MC from the islands of Hawaii, and credits much of her inspiration to personal experiences especially being raised by her single mother, personal challenges, politics, college, and many other topics that fill her brain. She is currently a college senior, studying Marketing at Hawaii Pacific University (HPU), and is set to graduate in Winter 2016. She has experience in content-writing for social media and blogs; and continues to channel her academic and professional skills towards her music. <br/><br/>Jehzan's music journey started with spoken word poetry. At age 17, she attended a summer leadership conference for minority youth housed at University of California's Berkeley Campus. The curriculum required students to pick an art form to reflect on during their experience, and Jehzan chose spoken word poetry. When she returned home to Hawaii, she soon began recording her poems over Hip Hop/Rap beats on Garage Band with some of her cousins and friends from church. Overtime, Jehzan found a knack for rapping while still keeping her poetic qualities. Throughout her early 20s, Jehzan has served in the Hawaii Army National Guard and has been a full-time student, all while she developed and strengthened her skills as a lyricist and performer. She has performed and/or made stage presences at a number of events and venues throughout Hawaii such as Hawaii Theatre, Queen Kapiolani Park Band Stage, Hawaii Pacific University, University of Hawaii West Oahu, Bar 35, Fresh Cafe, and Rende Vuu Nightclub. She has also appeared on online and Hawaii-based radio stations such as KNDI, KTUH, RudeBoyRadio, Connect Gang Radio, and P.O.L Radio. In 2015, after accepting her invitation to compete as an online finalist in Team Backpack's Mission Underground video auditions, Jehzan successfully fundraised her first crowdsource campaign via IndieGoGo. The funds enabled Jehzan to fly to Los Angeles to compete in Team Backpack's Live Cypher Draft. 2016 remains full of opportunity for this young writer, rapper, and entrepreneur. Jehzan is currently working on her upcoming mixtape, ""Island Waves &amp; City Haze,"" which is slated to drop in early July. Help Jehzan reach this campaign's fundraising goal as she continues to put Hawaii on the map for good.<br/></p></div>","WATCH THE VIDEO, IT EXPLAINS EVERYONE. THANKS!You can also read my artist biography below.Artist Bio:Jehzan is a twenty-four year old emcee, spoken word poet, freelance journalist, and budding entrepreneur from Honolulu, HI. She runs her own website as well as her own Hip Hop blog, hosted on www.JehzanExclusive.com. Jehzan credits most of her musical influence to 90s and 2000s Hip Hop and R&B artists such as 2Pac, Eminem, Missy Elliot, Lauryn Hill, T-Pain, Akon, and Nelly. However, she is a big fan of many artists in the independent Hip Hop genre such as Blue Scholars, Bambu, Classified, Hopsin, Dizzy Wright, Pryde, and Snow Tha Product. While choosing not to categorize herself as a solely as a ""conscious"" rapper, the level of Jehzan's lyrical content narrated through a variety of beats and instrumentals is of high caliber. She brings unique style as a female MC from the islands of Hawaii, and credits much of her inspiration to personal experiences especially being raised by her single mother, personal challenges, politics, college, and many other topics that fill her brain. She is currently a college senior, studying Marketing at Hawaii Pacific University (HPU), and is set to graduate in Winter 2016. She has experience in content-writing for social media and blogs; and continues to channel her academic and professional skills towards her music. Jehzan's music journey started with spoken word poetry. At age 17, she attended a summer leadership conference for minority youth housed at University of California's Berkeley Campus. The curriculum required students to pick an art form to reflect on during their experience, and Jehzan chose spoken word poetry. When she returned home to Hawaii, she soon began recording her poems over Hip Hop/Rap beats on Garage Band with some of her cousins and friends from church. Overtime, Jehzan found a knack for rapping while still keeping her poetic qualities. Throughout her early 20s, Jehzan has served in the Hawaii Army National Guard and has been a full-time student, all while she developed and strengthened her skills as a lyricist and performer. She has performed and/or made stage presences at a number of events and venues throughout Hawaii such as Hawaii Theatre, Queen Kapiolani Park Band Stage, Hawaii Pacific University, University of Hawaii West Oahu, Bar 35, Fresh Cafe, and Rende Vuu Nightclub. She has also appeared on online and Hawaii-based radio stations such as KNDI, KTUH, RudeBoyRadio, Connect Gang Radio, and P.O.L Radio.

Essentially, we will be filming a great gathering of people who are coming together to celebrate what music means to them (the greatest party ever). Your contributions will help us bring the people and the music together. <br/><p><br/></p>
<p>We need $8,000 to bring this vision to light properly. We will be collaborating with a professional film crew and we really want to pay them. Actually, we have to. Camera equipment, lights, stands, food for staff, staff, extras, pre-production, post-production, carpenters, producers, will come into play and they all cost a sufficient amount of money. You'll get a genuine music video that represents our song ""F.U.N.K."" in the fullest and most absorbing way possible. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><u>Video Concept</u></p>
<p>There will be a big party that we are going to film as the basis for the video. We want to capture the emotion of our music by bringing people together and filming their interactions. The party will be at our house in Queens, NY, where we live, write, record, play, and grow our music (an incubator of sorts). This video will allow you to immerse yourself into our song ""F.U.N.K"" which is about enjoying one another and living in the moment.  <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>There are a few things that we are confident in; one being our ability to throw a party. We also believe in our music (why else would we live on top of each other under one roof). We value our fans, friends, and family (without you this music we make has no meaning). We want everyone that appreciates our craft to be a part of this project in one way or another. If we don't meet our goal there will still be a video, but the more money we raise, the better the product will be. We have tons of new songs and visual concepts coming out after this project, so we want to start the next phase of our career in the right way. It all starts with making this video the way it is supposed to be made. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>If you can't donate money there are still ways you can contribute. We need extras for the video (the more the better). Food will help also (we have to feed everyone on set). We'll need a stage, so any materials or experience for building one is greatly appreciated. Please share this with everyone you know. The more people that see this, the better our chances are of reaching our goal. Don't be afraid to reach out and see what you can do to make this a possibility. <br/></p>

</div><h1>Kuonaista päivää!</h1><p>Me Kuonalla välitämme. Me haluamme ottaa teidät mukaan meidän ihanaan projektiin. Vaikka Mr. Lohja sanoi kesällä kännissä mitä sattui, me olemme ihmisen asialla.</p><p>Me haluamme tehdä kuonaisimman, limaa tihkuvimman, pahimman hajuisen levyn, jota kuunnellessa veri valuu korvista, ja kuvia katsellessa veri valuu silmistä. Se on rakkautta jos ei muu.</p><p>Meillä on kuitenkin ongelma. Me olemme kaikki kapitalisti-runkkareita ja joudumme tekemään päivätöitä ylläpitääksemme kapitalisti, riistäjä imagomme siviilissä.  Valitettavasti rahapalkkamme ei riitä kirkuvien lapsien, ulosottovelkojen, asuntolainojen, elatusmaksujen, pornhubin kuukausimaksujen ja muiden pakollisten kulujen jälkeen rahoittamaan tämän levyn kuluja. Toisinsanoen, me ollaan köyhiä runkkareita.</p><p><br/></p><h2>Ajatus (voiko basistilla olla ajatuksia?)</h2><div>
<p>Me annetaan teille kaikkea pientä kivaa, kun te sponssaatte meidän projektia. Meiltä löytyy kortsuja, plekuja, ties mitä! Kun te sponssaatte, niin me välitämme teistä. Lisäksi jokainen meitä tukenut saa nimensä levyn sisäkanteen.</p>Rahat menisivät siis studioaikaan, tuottajaan, miksaukseen ja masterointiin, merkkareihin, viinaan, jne. Jos pääsemme tarvittavaan summaan, eli 2000€ (mukavan pyöreä luku), Kuona julkaisee vuoden lopussa pitkäsoiton, joka saa kovimmankin bläk-metal miehen yökkäämään ja tärisemään.</div><h2>Portaat (taivaaseen)</h2><div>Jostain on lähdettävä liikkeelle. Mr. Lohja loukkaantui ja erosi bändistä. Kuona ei vaan ole Kuona ilman sitä seksikästä mörökölliä! Ja Lohja on kuitenkin Kuona-studion virallinen isäntä, joten päivitykset ovat vähäiset ja paska-laatuiset ilman häntä. Ja nyt kun se körmy on saatu takaisin, päivitykset rullaavat kuin himokas mursu jäälautalta mereen!</div><div><br/></div><div>Olemme huomanneet, että teidän kuoniaisten kukkaronnyörit ovat tiukalla, joten olemme tiivistäneet koko komeuden yhteen himoa ja visvaa tihkuvaan portaaseen: </div><div><br/></div><div>
<p><b>2000€</b>:sta me tunkataan kokopitkä älppäri kaikkine hienouksineen, merkkareineen ja kiertueineen. Tämä on siis meidän multihuipentuma, orgastinen tavoite. Jos tähän ei päästä, niin se saattaapi olla pelkkä EP, mikä sieltä putkahtaa ulos. Pahimmassa (*kylmänväreitä*) sieltä tulee vaan parin biisin sinkku.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Pistetään siis rattaat pyörimään ja hinkataan levy teille iloksi/suruksi Joulun lahjasukkaan tai takanlämmikkeeksi. Jarr!! Sillä saa vaikka anopin lähtemään jo Tapaninpäivänä takaisin Nurmoon tai Joutsaan! Tai saunan taakse, missä kukin sitä anoppiaan pitää.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2>Loppusanat</h2>
<div>Nyt kun seksi-ikoni ja huippumalli Mr. Lohja on taas rivissä, niin laitetaan homma kulkemaan! Jos tilaatte jotakin tuotessa, jossa on mahdollisuus valita jotakin, vaikkapa T-paitojen kokoa, plekun paksuutta tai kortsujen makua, pistäkään viestiä kuona85@gmail.com osoitteeseen. Me tunkataan siitä lahjasta sitten sellainen, että se ei täytä mitään odotuksia ja vituttaa vuoden loppuun. Ehkä jopa Helmikuuhun.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Tuossa vieressä on nyt siis lista erilaisista sponssaus mahdollisuuksista. Me päivitetään tänne videota ja kuvaa ja tekstiä, ylipäänsä Kuonaa teille nautittavaksi. <b>Huom! Jos nautit Kuonaa enemmän kuin yhden annoksen, kognitiivinen kykysi saattaa heikentyä emmekä vastaa vahingoista teille tai läheisillenne.</b>
</div>
<div>Kuona on epämetallia. Kuona on ei-haluttu. Kuona on sivutuote.</div>

Vaikka Mr. Lohja sanoi kesällä kännissä mitä sattui, me olemme ihmisen asialla.Me haluamme tehdä kuonaisimman, limaa tihkuvimman, pahimman hajuisen levyn, jota kuunnellessa veri valuu korvista, ja kuvia katsellessa veri valuu silmistä. Se on rakkautta jos ei muu.Meillä on kuitenkin ongelma. Me olemme kaikki kapitalisti-runkkareita ja joudumme tekemään päivätöitä ylläpitääksemme kapitalisti, riistäjä imagomme siviilissä.  Valitettavasti rahapalkkamme ei riitä kirkuvien lapsien, ulosottovelkojen, asuntolainojen, elatusmaksujen, pornhubin kuukausimaksujen ja muiden pakollisten kulujen jälkeen rahoittamaan tämän levyn kuluja. Toisinsanoen, me ollaan köyhiä runkkareita.Ajatus (voiko basistilla olla ajatuksia?)
Me annetaan teille kaikkea pientä kivaa, kun te sponssaatte meidän projektia. Meiltä löytyy kortsuja, plekuja, ties mitä! Kun te sponssaatte, niin me välitämme teistä. Lisäksi jokainen meitä tukenut saa nimensä levyn sisäkanteen.Rahat menisivät siis studioaikaan, tuottajaan, miksaukseen ja masterointiin, merkkareihin, viinaan, jne. Jos pääsemme tarvittavaan summaan, eli 2000€ (mukavan pyöreä luku), Kuona julkaisee vuoden lopussa pitkäsoiton, joka saa kovimmankin bläk-metal miehen yökkäämään ja tärisemään.Portaat (taivaaseen)Jostain on lähdettävä liikkeelle. Mr. Lohja loukkaantui ja erosi bändistä. Kuona ei vaan ole Kuona ilman sitä seksikästä mörökölliä! Ja Lohja on kuitenkin Kuona-studion virallinen isäntä, joten päivitykset ovat vähäiset ja paska-laatuiset ilman häntä. Ja nyt kun se körmy on saatu takaisin, päivitykset rullaavat kuin himokas mursu jäälautalta mereen!Olemme huomanneet, että teidän kuoniaisten kukkaronnyörit ovat tiukalla, joten olemme tiivistäneet koko komeuden yhteen himoa ja visvaa tihkuvaan portaaseen: 
2000€:sta me tunkataan kokopitkä älppäri kaikkine hienouksineen, merkkareineen ja kiertueineen. Tämä on siis meidän multihuipentuma, orgastinen tavoite. Jos tähän ei päästä, niin se saattaapi olla pelkkä EP, mikä sieltä putkahtaa ulos. Pahimmassa (*kylmänväreitä*) sieltä tulee vaan parin biisin sinkku.

Pistetään siis rattaat pyörimään ja hinkataan levy teille iloksi/suruksi Joulun lahjasukkaan tai takanlämmikkeeksi. Jarr!! Sillä saa vaikka anopin lähtemään jo Tapaninpäivänä takaisin Nurmoon tai Joutsaan! Tai saunan taakse, missä kukin sitä anoppiaan pitää.

Loppusanat
Nyt kun seksi-ikoni ja huippumalli Mr. Lohja on taas rivissä, niin laitetaan homma kulkemaan! Jos tilaatte jotakin tuotessa, jossa on mahdollisuus valita jotakin, vaikkapa T-paitojen kokoa, plekun paksuutta tai kortsujen makua, pistäkään viestiä kuona85@gmail.com osoitteeseen. Me tunkataan siitä lahjasta sitten sellainen, että se ei täytä mitään odotuksia ja vituttaa vuoden loppuun. Ehkä jopa Helmikuuhun.

Tuossa vieressä on nyt siis lista erilaisista sponssaus mahdollisuuksista. Me päivitetään tänne videota ja kuvaa ja tekstiä, ylipäänsä Kuonaa teille nautittavaksi. Huom! Jos nautit Kuonaa enemmän kuin yhden annoksen, kognitiivinen kykysi saattaa heikentyä emmekä vastaa vahingoista teille tai läheisillenne.

Kuona on epämetallia. Kuona on ei-haluttu. Kuona on sivutuote.
Pysykää nuhteessa!

<p>Having overcome my own serious challenges, <b>I've spent a large portion of my life helping those who are battling addiction</b>, and this album will be an extension of that.</p>
<p>One of the songs written for the album was actually co-written by my daughter Lauryn, too, who will also be playing on it – something really special for me. </p>
<p>Beyond this being just another collection of good songs it also will be a tool that can be used to:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Start conversations</span></li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Challenge toxic thinking</span><br/>
</li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Bring hope to those who are living without any</span></li>
</ul>
<div>Here's the thing: <b>I want to do it <i>well</i>. But to do it well I need some help.</b>
</div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div>
<h3 style=""font-weight: bold;"">Not just a CD – but a DVD <i>plus booklet</i>!</h3>
<p>As <b>the <b>heart of this project is its </b><i>message</i></b>, (rather than me trying to be a rock star), then to communicate it in more than just songs will give it the best chance of lasting success. So, I'm planning a <b>10-song CD</b>, a <b>DVD </b>and a supporting <b>booklet </b>(similar to the Norah Jones packaging below):</p>

<br/>
<p>1. The <b>CD </b>will contain songs that carry a strong theme of transformation and hope. <br/></p>
<p>2. The <b>DVD </b>will contain an interview with me sharing the stories &amp; meanings behind the songs. I'll also tell more about the journey of my life, and give clear, practical steps to help those who are struggling in similar difficult situations to those I've overcome.</p>
<p>3. The <b>booklet </b>will credit everybody by name who has contributed to making this project a reality, list all song lyrics, give directions on how to get the most out of the resource and might even feature a photo of me!<br/></p>

Hi, I'm Terry! How are you?

Having had such an overwhelmingly positive response to my first ever professionally recorded song, Let Me In, I've decided to record a full-length album!


Having overcome my own serious challenges, I've spent a large portion of my life helping those who are battling addiction, and this album will be an extension of that.
One of the songs written for the album was actually co-written by my daughter Lauryn, too, who will also be playing on it – something really special for me. 
Beyond this being just another collection of good songs it also will be a tool that can be used to:

Start conversations

Challenge toxic thinking

Bring hope to those who are living without any

Here's the thing: I want to do it well. But to do it well I need some help.



Not just a CD – but a DVD plus booklet!
As the heart of this project is its message, (rather than me trying to be a rock star), then to communicate it in more than just songs will give it the best chance of lasting success. So, I'm planning a 10-song CD, a DVD and a supporting booklet (similar to the Norah Jones packaging below):



1. The CD will contain songs that carry a strong theme of transformation and hope. 
2. The DVD will contain an interview with me sharing the stories & meanings behind the songs. I'll also tell more about the journey of my life, and give clear, practical steps to help those who are struggling in similar difficult situations to those I've overcome.
3. The booklet will credit everybody by name who has contributed to making this project a reality, list all song lyrics, give directions on how to get the most out of the resource and might even feature a photo of me!

   
£10,000+ is my goal


These are the estimated expenses that will go into making this record. My team and I will be extremely careful with how we spend this money. Each of these costs is significantly less than if this was being released on a traditional label, and we will be doing as much of the grunt work as possible ourselves.


Recording = £3,600


Mixing = £2,400


Mastering = £500


Filming = £720

DVD editing & production = £720

Photography, artwork and packaging design = £720

1,000 CD & DVD production run = £2000

Anything we raise above the goal will be directed toward marketing, touring, and promotion of the record. 

What you'll get from me

As a way of saying thanks, I've come up with some fun perks to give you in return for every donation. Each reward is unique and I've never before given or sold these items. All the more special to be a part!

The more we raise, the more we can do: Every pledge counts. However small your contribution, it is hugely appreciated! If we join forces anything is possible. 

Even if I don't reach my entire goal then all funds pledged will go towards making the best product possible within that budget. I promise that nothing will be wasted or pledged in vain.

  My studio choice
To help me I've found a great local studio – Revelator – to work with, enlisting Mark Pierce as producer/project manager to guide me. 



Mark specializes in working with songwriters and solo artists on instrumentation, production, branding, photography, artwork design, and digital distribution.


He has produced over 200 songs, plays multiple instruments, and has extensive experience as a studio musician. 
Before starting Revelator in 2005, Mark worked in senior roles for a number of design agencies, the accounts including BBC, ITV, SKY, LLP & EMAP, and has worked on marketing campaigns for Elton John & Bryan Adams.
Also, his photography has been used by Toni & Guy, Parcelforce, Aviva & Penguin Books.

<h3>Short Summary</h3> <p><i>Love And Fear</i> is a record that I was inspired to begin in 2011. Life took me down some paths I didn't expect and taught me a lot of lessons. I wanted make this record a lot sooner, but God had other plans for me. Five years later, the time has come.</p>
<p>I've written and demoed 13 songs that are ready to see light and be light for others. But making the record won't be easy. I and the musicians who are taking this on together--we need your help.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We've already scouted some viable recording spots for <i>Love And Fear,</i> and we've made some demos. But making a record is not quite that simple. When you join us by making a pledge, here is what you're funding:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Recording equipment (microphones, mastering tools, etc.)</li>
<li>Session musicians (for parts that aren't standard rock quartet stuff)</li>
<li>Merch (for the perks you'll get when you pledge, and for whomever we meet on the road)</li>
</ul>We've been talking to some excellent session musicians and co-producers, and we're really excited about the talent that'll be going into making this record.<p>Everyone who pledges $10 or more gets an instant download of our first demo from the record, ""Find You In The Light"" (featuring my good friend Crystal Cummings for the band One Renown), as well as an advance download of <i>Love And Fear</i> when it's finished and ready to roll. Other perks will include t-shirts, posters, and more.</p>
<p>If you watched the promo video, that was ""Find You In The Light."" You have to contribute to download it, but you can listen to it at this link:

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p><i>Love And Fear</i> was inspired by a time in my life when things we're very dark. Music was my therapy and my outlet. It had been for years prior, which is the real reason why I'm in music today. Christ showed Himself to me and brought hope through music and through the people who nurtured me into my life in music. A lot of times, having a song that shows you someone else in the world knows how you feel--sometimes that's all a person has. That's the whole point of <i>Love And Fear:</i> to show the world that when they're still loved even when the world is terrifying and crashing around them. We're not trying to be superstars, just to shine light in dark places.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Straight up, we're not trying to be superstars, but to be successful in music, you need to be noticed, and being noticed in music isn't always easy. The industry is diverse and full of talent, but there are also fantastic musicians that the world doesn't even know exists. Point blank: that might be us. But we won't know until we've poured everything we have into this. And that's exactly what we're going to do.</p>
<p>Getting booked for shows, getting in touch with the right people, making connections with other musicians, and getting noticed will be the biggest challenges, but with your support and willingness to spread the word, we can make this happen.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Not everyone can put money into this. We all know what that's like. ;) But the best way that you can help is by spreading the word to friends and family. We're on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, so you can connect with us there.</p>
<p>All it would take is 500 pre-orders of <i>Love And Fear</i> to make this happen. That's 500 people pledging $10 to get an instant download of our ""Find You in the Light"" demo and an advance download of <i>Love And Fear</i> when it's finished. And the more we can raise, the more we can do.</p>

Dans un monde aux prises avec tant de stress, il nous semble important de faire en sorte que les gens puissent avoir accès à de la musique facilitant la relaxation ainsi que  la possibilité d’entrer dans un état de méditation et de joie: un état d'intériorisation et de présence à soi.  Le mot mantra signifie d’ailleurs en sanskrit ""libération du mental"", et nous avons tous et toutes besoin d'apaiser le tourbillon des pensés, afin accéder à ce qu'il y'a au-delà. <div>

<p>Our band name is Sundaram.  Which in Sanskrit means beauty; and that is what we strive to create as we play music with these ancient mantras of India.  The word mantra means liberation from the mind, which is the effect of their repetition in these group singing sessions called kirtan.</p>
<p>Since four years now we have been gathering once a week to sing with our community.  We see everyone leaving open, peaceful, and happy at the end of the evening which is proof for us of the good that it does to people; and its an effect which we feel in ourselves as well.  </p>
<p>Often we're asked to make a new album, so now we're reaching out for your help to raise the funds necessary to provide this for everyone who would like to dive into this music of meditation and ecstatic joy.</p>
<p>All contributions help, and together we can gather enough funds to get this healing music to those awaiting, or interested, listeners.  For any donation bigger than 20$ you will receive the album when it is ready, by choosing a perk.  Although no perk is necessary: you can choose to give any amount you feel compelled to give.</p>
<p>And please feel free to help out by sharing this campaign with others!</p>

Les gens nous demandent souvent si nous avons un album de disponible afin qu’ils écoutent notre musique à la maison, mais la réalisation d’un un tel projet demande des ressources financières importantes.
Nous aurons besoin minimalisent de 7000 $ pour réaliser ce projet:  2000$ pour imprimer les disques et pochettes, 3000$ pour la prise de son et l'édition, 1000$ pour le ""mastering"", et $1000 pour les 4 musiciens. 
 
7000$ est un montant minimal: nous espèrons de ramasser plus pour offrir un produit d'encore meilleure qualité, et de pouvoir mettre un peut dans la publicité et le diffusion.

Pour recevoir un album,  lorsqu’il sera terminé, vous devez faire un donation de 20$ ou plus et cliquer sur un perks (ce sont des cadeaux bonus que vous choisissez avec les montants que vous decidez de donner).  
VOUS POUVEZ AUSSI DONNER LE MONTANT DE VOTRE CHOIX SANS L'OBLIGATION DE CHOISIR UN PERK.  JUST CLIQUEZ SUR LE BOUTON ""BACK IT"". 
ATTENTION: n'oubliez pas que si vous voulez l'album vous devez cliquer sur un perk.
;)  =)

The Impact

En chantant à chaque semaine, en compagnie d’une cinquantaine de personnes, nous recevons de nombreux témoignages de gens qui nous disent à quel point chanter leur fait du bien.  Dans un monde aux prises avec tant de stress, il nous semble important de faire en sorte que les gens puissent avoir accès à de la musique facilitant la relaxation ainsi que  la possibilité d’entrer dans un état de méditation et de joie: un état d'intériorisation et de présence à soi.  Le mot mantra signifie d’ailleurs en sanskrit ""libération du mental"", et nous avons tous et toutes besoin d'apaiser le tourbillon des pensés, afin accéder à ce qu'il y'a au-delà. 


    Other Ways You Can Help Tout les dons, peu importe le montant font une différence.    Et s'il vous plait partagez si vous connaissez des gens qui, vous pensez, pourraient aimer ce genre de musique.Merci de tout coeur!
Hari Om!
Voici un lien vers notre vidéo pour vous donner une idée de notre musique.

English
Our band name is Sundaram.  Which in Sanskrit means beauty; and that is what we strive to create as we play music with these ancient mantras of India.  The word mantra means liberation from the mind, which is the effect of their repetition in these group singing sessions called kirtan.
Since four years now we have been gathering once a week to sing with our community.  We see everyone leaving open, peaceful, and happy at the end of the evening which is proof for us of the good that it does to people; and its an effect which we feel in ourselves as well.  
Often we're asked to make a new album, so now we're reaching out for your help to raise the funds necessary to provide this for everyone who would like to dive into this music of meditation and ecstatic joy.
All contributions help, and together we can gather enough funds to get this healing music to those awaiting, or interested, listeners.  For any donation bigger than 20$ you will receive the album when it is ready, by choosing a perk.  Although no perk is necessary: you can choose to give any amount you feel compelled to give.
And please feel free to help out by sharing this campaign with others!
thank you so much!

<h3>The Goal</h3>
<p>Initially, the start of this project was delayed because of an accident I had during a performance in 2013.  I ripped off both knee caps in a jump from the stage into the audience.  What followed was nearly one year wheelchair-bound and many months of challenging physical therapy.  But, I'm back on my feet again, and I'm looking forward to achieving this project's goal of bridging the generations and reaching the masses with enduring and endearing music.  And, of course, reaching our pledge goal will go a long way towards making that possible.<br/></p>

<h3>Challenges &amp; Risks</h3>As you might expect, creating an album of music, manufacturing and releasing it to the masses takes quite a bit of planning, persistence, resources fan engagement and involvement.  Add to this the fact that the music business has changed dramatically over the past few years.  Gone are the days when a ""record company"" recorded, manufactured and released a disc.  Now, it is possible for an artist to completely control their music from songwriting to recording to release.  It's risky, though, because without fan support for manufacturing and distribution, a great album can end up just sitting on the shelve.  Add to that the ever-changing unpredictability of making music that lasts for generations and we've got quite a challenge.  Add to<i> that</i> the possibility of not reaching our financial goal.  The recording phase of <b>Welcome To My World</b> has ended, and there is a small amount left in the budget to get this next phase started.  But, getting this album to the masses on a grand global scale--that takes a Herculean effort. <span style=""background-color: initial;""> I believe we can do this together and be successful.  Unlike the old days, you can be more involved in the process releasing of this album with me than ever before!  And, I welcome the opportunity to touch base with each of you!</span>

</div></div>","Who Am I ""Clif Payne is a lush tenor with soaring melismas in his individual passages.""Don Heckman, LA Times
I'm R&B/smooth jazz vocalist Clif Payne, and--Welcome To My World !
RELEASE DATE: February 9, 2016

Wednesday, Feb. 24--This morning, I received this message from CD Baby:
""CD Baby RESTOCK request for clifpayne / Welcome to My WorldClif-Congratulations! Your music has been selling and we need more copies of Clif Payne: Welcome to My World to satisfy anticipated demand.""
i.e. We sold out of the hardcopy CDs! Wow and Yeaaaaa! Thank so much for the overwhelming response domestically and abroad. You can still download the album. But we need to re-stock the ""hardcopy"" CDs to meet the increasing demand. I need your help, so I've started an Indiegogo campaign to ask for support to manufacture and distribute more hardcopy CDs of Welcome to My World. You've been so supportive and encouraging regarding my music. Now, here's your chance to be a part of the process of getting more CDs of WTMW to the masses. Preston Glass, Larry Batiste, Freda Payne and the entire ""cast"" of Welcome To My World--we are truly blown away by your response. It will absolutely help to make our day if you would lend me your continued support.--especially at this time. 
Thank you all so much! You are fantastique!
                                                                *   *   *
Born in Harlem, I now reside in the beautiful San Francisco Bay Area.  Since being ""discovered"" by Bobby McFerrin, I've performed internationally and have opened for Tony Bennett, Johnny Mathis and Dionne Warwick.  In my career, I've sung on many recordings.  But now, my own debut solo album--Welcome To My World-- is almost ready for release.  And, I just couldn't be more excited about it.  Here's why:

The Artists
Produced by Soul Music Hall of Fame inductee Preston Glass, the album features some of the finest  LA musicians in the world including original En Vogue singer Maxine Jones, Midnight Star co-founder Reggie Calloway, Grammy Awards show music director/producer Larry Batiste and a very special guest appearance by R&B/Jazz legend Freda Payne.




The Songs

on the album are written in the R&B/Jazz style--capitvating grooves  They are a musical mosaic of life and love seen through my view of the world--it's a reflection of who I am.  Eight of the 10 songs were written by Preston, Larry and myself.  The remaining 2 songs--well, I'll let that be a big surprise!  But the highlight of the album is my duet with the legendary R&B/Jazz vocalist Freda Payne on the song ""No Payne, No Gain.""


The Goal
Initially, the start of this project was delayed because of an accident I had during a performance in 2013.  I ripped off both knee caps in a jump from the stage into the audience.  What followed was nearly one year wheelchair-bound and many months of challenging physical therapy.  But, I'm back on my feet again, and I'm looking forward to achieving this project's goal of bridging the generations and reaching the masses with enduring and endearing music.  And, of course, reaching our pledge goal will go a long way towards making that possible.




The Recording & Mixing Phase . . .
of Welcome To My World  was completed in early January of this year at Laughing Tiger Studio in San Rafael, California and Private Island Audio in Los Angeles.  Ari Rios engineered the Laughing Tiger sessions and Adrian Ensor engineered the Private Audio sessions.  

Challenges & RisksAs you might expect, creating an album of music, manufacturing and releasing it to the masses takes quite a bit of planning, persistence, resources fan engagement and involvement.  Add to this the fact that the music business has changed dramatically over the past few years.  Gone are the days when a ""record company"" recorded, manufactured and released a disc.  Now, it is possible for an artist to completely control their music from songwriting to recording to release.  It's risky, though, because without fan support for manufacturing and distribution, a great album can end up just sitting on the shelve.  Add to that the ever-changing unpredictability of making music that lasts for generations and we've got quite a challenge.  Add to that the possibility of not reaching our financial goal.  The recording phase of Welcome To My World has ended, and there is a small amount left in the budget to get this next phase started.  But, getting this album to the masses on a grand global scale--that takes a Herculean effort.  I believe we can do this together and be successful.  Unlike the old days, you can be more involved in the process releasing of this album with me than ever before!  And, I welcome the opportunity to touch base with each of you!

 How You Can Help & What You Will Get
 We are now in the manufacturing, marketing & distribution phase.  This is where you can exert your much-needed impact.  Having personally contributed in the past to the crowdfunding musical projects of Victoria Theodore, Mark Little and Mike Blankenship, and seeing how successful it is possible to be with solid and engaging fan support, I understand just how important your contribution will be. 
Where does your money go?  Specifically:

The cost of manufacturing more CDs! (we've sold out!), pressing the album on  vinyl, hi-tech transferal to digital downloads and potential music re-mixes.  Estimate:  $4,000 The development and the implementation of a strategy to impact the airwaves, traditional media (newspaper, magazines, billboards) and retail outlets on a grand scale.  Advertising and getting radio airplay is extremely challenging and costly.  We would love to be able to promote the album on the airwaves at least 6 months.  Estimate: $3,000
CD Release/Listening Party in Los Angeles  Estimate:  $3,000

Basic hardcopy press kits (Fees / Postage / Materials)  Estimate: $2,000

Credit card and Indiegogo (Fees / Postage / Materials) Estimate:  $2,000

Perks production and shipment   Estimate:  $2,000

These are only estimates with the costs potentially being less than or more than the stated estimates.  And all of your money will go directly into this manufacturing, marketing & distribution phase of Welcome To My World.   



What Will You Get In Return?  You'll get a great album, of course, but you'll also get some cool perks--as you can see on the right side of this page.  Don't see a perk that peaks your interest?  Suggest one that does!  If you have any questions, just contact me at saangpayne@gmail.com.

<p>It was only a few years ago that Jake and I met while playing in the Worcester, MA hardcore/metal band Vultures. Late last year that band went on what would become an indefinite hiatus. We looked at this as an opportunity to head in a new direction. A direction that while still bringing the same grit and intensity as before would be harder, faster and more melodic. With a little help from our friends we were able to demo a few songs and do a short winter tour. </p>
<p>Now we need your help! We have already done the legwork and spent a few thousand dollars to get things rolling but recently, as some of you may have heard, we had a van accident. Fortunately no one was hurt but it did soak up the rest of our funds. After renting a truck and a trailer and towing our van and our gear back from Upstate New York we learned that the van was totaled. We barely covered the expenses and soon realized there was no way to get this music released.</p>

<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Recently campaign fundraising of another kind has changed the way we look at the world here in America. Let's just say it. If Bernie Sanders, love him or hate him, can raise millions with a message to get money out of politics why can't we do the same with the music industry.</p>
<p>There have been many different approaches and fans of music are starting to understand this format, but it's lacking something. Bands and artists don't show you how the money gets spent.</p>
<p>We however, will show you how every dollar is spent and that making a top notch record comes at a price. Who knows, if we exceed our goal we may be able to do things we may have only dreamed about. Essentially, the success of this campaign will determine how amazing this record will become as well as how Nihil's future pans out. Extra money can mean a lot: more music, more tours, more fast, and more loud. We have designed this campaign to use Flex Funding. This means if we don't reach our goal, we are still getting the money that is raised. So, if we don't reach our goal, we will have to reevaluate how we are planning to do this record. Regardless, we are ready to deliver however our campaign plays out.</p>

What We Need & What You Get
Recently campaign fundraising of another kind has changed the way we look at the world here in America. Let's just say it. If Bernie Sanders, love him or hate him, can raise millions with a message to get money out of politics why can't we do the same with the music industry.
There have been many different approaches and fans of music are starting to understand this format, but it's lacking something. Bands and artists don't show you how the money gets spent.
We however, will show you how every dollar is spent and that making a top notch record comes at a price. Who knows, if we exceed our goal we may be able to do things we may have only dreamed about. Essentially, the success of this campaign will determine how amazing this record will become as well as how Nihil's future pans out.

<p>This is a fund raising campaign asking you to <b>pre-order</b> my new 15 song CD.  There are many investment levels to choose from that include merchandise, tickets to the CD release party with VIP seating (fall of 2016), BONUS songs only available online, video clips of the actual studio recordings, an up and close personal concert with just me and my guitar, or my band performing live at a venue of your choice.  When you pre-order, you’ll be helping us get back in the studio to get the songs recorded, mixed and CDs manufactured.  The details of which I talk about in the BUDGET section below.  </p>
<p>BUDGET (what does it cost to record this CD?)</p>
<p>Typically, in this market recording costs can range between 1500.00 &amp; 2,000.00 per song to record a CD and include the manufacturing of 1000 CD’s.  It helps to have done this before with the Foster Martin Band, so I have a good idea of costs.</p>
<p>I started pre-production for this project over a year ago.  Writing, recording rough demos which meant paying musicians and studio time.  Countless rehearsals with the band trying out songs that may or may not make the album.  Photo sessions, video recordings and editing, web site design, CD design, social media preparation and so on…..</p>
<p>So up until now, I’ve spent about 7000.00 slowly putting the final list together and now we’re ready.  15 brand new real country songs are ready to hit the studio, not to mention 3 BONUS songs already recorded,  and I believe we can finish it for about 7500.00.  That’s the pre-order fund raising target goal.  Last but not least, I would not be doing this project but for the grace of God, therefore a portion of all funds raised will be donated to a charity which supports the homeless.  My new CD will be called Real Country, so please ""select a perk"" and help us get this new album completed.  Thanks, Ray Martin</p><br/></div>","PROJECT OVERVIEW (what’s it all about)

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

<p>As independent artists it is not an easy task to produce such a large project and music videos and do it with excellence.  If something is worth doing, we believe it should be done with excellence for Him. We want to be able to market this project so it gets the attention it deserves.  We want to be able to promote a couple of these songs to radio to reach even more people with this message, but that is where we need your help.  It costs a lot of money to accomplish what we are trying to do.  After recording our last album and touring the past 18 months we were able to save and have invested all our profits back into this project, but we still don’t have what we need to accomplish our goals. </p>
<p>Part of our platform is being real, transparent and authentic in everything we do. Here is the breakdown of some of the required costs.  If you want more specifics on how we developed the budget or exactly where the money is going please ask:</p>

 Your contribution is like supporting a mission trip or missionary.  As independent artists we can only produce music and share the message of the Gospel with your support!   Risks & Challenges We have prayed fervently for this project and sought God's wisdom and His will.  We have full faith that this project will come to fruition.  If we do not get the funds we need, we will still move forward, but will have to cut back in quality, promotion, a delay in release and ultimately a decrease in the number of people we will be able to reach for Jesus. To overcome, we will continue to invest all we have into the project. We are booking shows and cutting corners any way we can personally.   

Other Ways You Can Help We totally understand some people just can't financially contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help!  We know PRAYER is the most important component of this campaign and our ministry in general. We are still trusting Him to provide all the funds necessary.  Join us as prayer warriors asking God to supply all our needs.
Get the word out and make some noise about our campaign. Email, share and tell people you think would share the vision of our mission. Please use the Indiegogo share tools!   And that's all there is to it.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>For the past 20 years I have written and arranged live music for youth circus performances in partnership with iconic Youth Circus pioneer <b>Jackie Davis</b>, and also directors <b>Sara Greene </b>and<b> </b><b>Jonathan Roitman</b>. Now the moment has come for me to finally (YES!) put all the best pieces down on an album for posterity, but more importantly to make them available for youth circus directors and educators to use freely as accompaniment for their live performances.</p>
<p>Currently, I am already in the process of recording this quintessential collection of music. These pieces are all tried and true works that have supported many solo and group acts on stage in the circus arts. From lively to lyrical, energetic to humorous, dramatic to endearing, the music comes alive with the many textured layers of fiddles, flutes, trombone, tuba, piano, percussion, drums, and more.</p>
<p>
Please have a look at the video, explore this site, check out our unique perks (rewards) and seriously consider donating. Your generosity will help me to preserve and archive the music that has been loved and delighted in for many years by audience and artists alike in performances by <b>Hilltop Circus, Flying Gravity Circus, Silver Lining Circus</b> and the new<b> Granite State Circus</b>.  With your help it will be made available far and wide;  wherever original music is needed that is carefully crafted to play a crucial supportive role for young people in the circus arts.</p>

I am originally from Australia and have also lived in Canada so I would consider myself a Third-Culture-Kid, not defined by any ethnicity, nationality, or any one specific culture, but a unique blend of cultures. From this position, I hope to become an artist in Japan in order to become one of the many cultural bridges of the world to unite people of different countries through the common experience of music. As someone who has also experienced racism and abuse in some forms, I also hope to use music to support those who may feel broken and alone, to somehow give strength to those who are facing difficulties.</p><p>初めまして！アカシと申します。日本の東京と神奈川辺りで活動しているシンガーソングライター・コンポーザーです。カナダから引っ越してきましたが元々オーストラリアの出身で、どこの国の人かを聞かれたら本当に答えられませんのでTCK（サードカルチャーキッド）と思ってください。TCKというのは国籍と文化が色々混ぜている世界的な市民ってことです。この立場で日本でアーティストになることを目指し、音楽を通して世界の人々をつなげるために一つの文化的な橋になりたいです。僕は昔色々差別やいじめも経験したことがあって、音楽を通して落ち込んでる人や差別されてる人々の味方になりたいです。音楽には力があると思いますので、その力を使って苦しい時を超える力をどうかあげたいのです。</p><p>Please check out my website at <a href=""https://www.ZeroToHiro.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.ZeroToHiro.com</a></p><p>よかったら僕のサイトをチェックしてくださいね、<a href=""https://www.ZeroToHiro.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.ZeroToHiro.com</a></p><p>There you can preview some of the songs that might make it onto the EP in their amateur quality conditions!</p><p>そこでこのEPに出る曲のプレビューを聞くことができます。</p><p>Please also follow me on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram on</p><p><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/Akashi.Music"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.facebook.com/Akashi.Music</a></p><p><a href=""http://www.twitter.com/Akashi_RedDeath"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.twitter.com/Akashi_RedDeath</a></p><p><a href=""http://www.instagram.com/Akashi.Tokyo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.instagram.com/Akashi.Tokyo</a></p><p>以上のフェースブック、ツイッター、インスタグラムとパトリオンサイトでフォローしてください。</p><p>To have a listen at some of the tracks as previews, please check out this page. You can also hear the full streams of the draft versions of two tracks in this EP for some fun insight into the writing process. <a href=""https://www.zerotohiro.com/music"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.zerotohiro.com/music</a></p><p>以上のページでこのEPに入ってる２つのトラックのドラフトを全体的に聞くことが可能です。作曲作りプロセスを少し見れますので面白いと思います。</p><p><strong>A little more about me?</strong></p><p>The genre I like to write in is, for lack of a better term, ""Emo"" Alternative Rock with symphonic elements. My favourite bands are: Nano, Shunn, My Chemical Romance, Panic! At the Disco.<br/>I'm an avid gamer. My favourite titles are the Nier series, the Persona series, and the Zelda series to name just a few. Playing these games influence me when I compose orchestral music, but that's separate to being a singer-songwriter.</p><p>僕の一番好きなジャンルはエモっていうロックのサブジャンルです。同時にオーケストラ系ゲームBGM音楽も好きなので、僕の曲にはエモもロックもオーケストラの影響もあります。一番好きなバンドは日本でいうとナノとShunnで、アメリカというとMy Chemical RomanceとPanic! at the Discoです。</p><p>趣味はビデオゲームで、一番好きなシリーズはニーアとペルソナとゼルダ伝説です。</p><p><strong>The Gist</strong></p><p>I have decided to run this campaign because, in my preparation for making this EP, I have been learning a lot about how difficult this process can be, both in energy but also financially. In order to become a sustainable artist, one needs to balance a variety of things including marketing, distribution, fan-interaction, etc. however, nothing can begin until the artist moves past the bottleneck which is the production of the first CD. With a product in circulation, the artist is able to more freely work on all the other important things that need to be done to progress in his or her career. Therefore, this campaign is important to me because it is my first major step to becoming an artist here and to be able to cover some of the expenses of producing a debut EP will help us greatly, and once it is done, the bottleneck is overcome and I will be more free to engage in many more exciting activities.</p><p>このキャンペーンを作ろうとした理由は、EPを準備する中で色々な難しさがあってサポートが必要だからです。特にエージェンシーから独立したアーティストになるには大変お金がかかるので、難しいです。その上に普通ならエージェンシーがやってくれることが色々あって（マーケティング、流通、プロデュース、などなど）、すべてが自分でやらなければなりません。でも、もちろん最初にやらないと何もできないなのは売れるクオリティのCDを作ることです。僕のアーティストとしての最初の一歩ですので、このキャンペーンはすごく大事です。この最初のEPを作ることができたら他のアーティスト活動をはじめるとして色々な扉が開くと思うので、よろしければサポートをしてください。</p><p>My artist name is Akashi, which can mean many things, but my real name is Hiro. My website is called ZeroToHiro. I have chosen this name because at this very moment, I am literally a Zero. However, with your help right now in supporting my first great step on the journey, I will move towards the goal of becoming Hiro; to move toward becoming my ""true self"", in other words, the ""me"" that I am meant to be"", the ""me"" of the future.</p><p>アーティスト名意味の多くあるアカシですが、本名はヒロです。サイトはゼロトゥーヒロといいます。どういう意味かというと、僕は今のところはでまだ「ゼロ」で誰にも知られていないけど、いつか必ず「ヒロ」として本当の自分になるんだということです。</p><p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p><p>In order to create the first EP, I need $2000 USD in order to professionally produce just 4 songs. This price includes hiring of musicians to play for the recording, a professional mixer and recording engineer, and many other things.</p><p>最初のEPを作るために、4曲で約20万円が必要です。この値段はミュージシャンやレコーディング、ミックスのエンジニアへのギャラなどで、それでもぎりぎりの予算なのです。</p><p>In addition to the $2000, I require new photos for this project which brings the budget up higher. If you have been following me for a while you may notice I have used the same photos for 6 years now. While they are great, I do need a revamp of my image to suit my style as a singer-songwriter. As a result, a photographer is also required and budgeted. I am also continually taking vocal lessons to ensure that the quality of my work will always be improving.</p><p>さらにフォトシュートなども必要です。これまでフォローしてくれた方は気づいていると思いますが、僕が今使っている写真は6年前の写真なので、今の新しいイメージの写真が必要なのです。また歌のクオリティをもっともっと上げるためにボーカルレッスンを受け続く必要があります。</p><p>Here is a rough breakdown:</p><p>以下は必要な費用の一覧：</p><p>Mixing and Recording: $250 per song</p><p>ミックスと録音：1曲で2.5万円</p><p>Hiring an instrumentalist: $100 per instrument, per song.</p><p>ミュージシャンへのギャラ：１楽器、1曲で1万円</p><p>Recording Director: $60 per day</p><p>レコーディングディレクター：1日で6千円</p><p>CD Manufacturing: Still Unknown<br/>Digital Distribution: Still Unkown<br/>Physical Distribution: Still Unknown</p><p>CD制作、デジタル配信、流通などいついてはまだはっきりしません</p><p>Photographer: Between $500 to $1200 depending on the Photographer and Quality</p><p>フォトグラファーは腕によりますが5万円から12万円くらいです。</p><p>And these are all at negotiated prices, to give you an indication of how much it costs to make a CD.</p><p>普通はもっと高いようですが、なんとかお願いしてこれくらいに収まるようにしようと考えています。</p><p>At this point I am aiming to cut costs by doing the graphic design myself.</p><p>好きだしコストカットにもなるので、グラフィックデザインは多分自分でやります。</p><p>If I can reach beyond $2000, I might be able to add more songs and still finish the EP in the projected deadline.</p><p>この予算で4曲入れられますが、20万円を超えることができれば曲をもっと入れられる可能性があります。</p><p>I have set the final goal as $6000 because I do not intend to make an EP and retire, I intend to work hard to keep making more and more music. I hope to make a full Album at the end of next year and while 4 tracks cost $2000, I imagine 12 tracks will be much more costly. In this way, it would really help to have a headstart with that funding.</p><p>ゴールは50万円にした理由は、このEPを完成した後に活動が終わるわけではなくて、そこからフルアルバムを作るために準備したいからです。4曲で20万円でしたらきっと12曲はそれよりもっと高いと思いますので、サポートしてもらえたらすごくありがたいです！</p><p>If the goal is not reached, I am still going ahead with the EP project so rest assured that 100% of the funds will go toward either the EP or future music endeavours.</p><p>ゴールに届かなくてもEPは必ず作りますので安心してください。お金はすべて音楽の活動のために使います。</p><p><strong>Perks!</strong></p><p>It is difficult to post CDs internationally from Japan. Japan Post seems to have quoted the postage to Australia as $23 Australian dollars, however, I suspect this is incorrect. I have therefore put the shipping as $3 USD for now. Because of this, backers who wish to acquire my EP will receive a digital copy unless I discover a cheaper way to get the physical discs overseas.

I am originally from Australia and have also lived in Canada so I would consider myself a Third-Culture-Kid, not defined by any ethnicity, nationality, or any one specific culture, but a unique blend of cultures. From this position, I hope to become an artist in Japan in order to become one of the many cultural bridges of the world to unite people of different countries through the common experience of music. As someone who has also experienced racism and abuse in some forms, I also hope to use music to support those who may feel broken and alone, to somehow give strength to those who are facing difficulties.初めまして！アカシと申します。日本の東京と神奈川辺りで活動しているシンガーソングライター・コンポーザーです。カナダから引っ越してきましたが元々オーストラリアの出身で、どこの国の人かを聞かれたら本当に答えられませんのでTCK（サードカルチャーキッド）と思ってください。TCKというのは国籍と文化が色々混ぜている世界的な市民ってことです。この立場で日本でアーティストになることを目指し、音楽を通して世界の人々をつなげるために一つの文化的な橋になりたいです。僕は昔色々差別やいじめも経験したことがあって、音楽を通して落ち込んでる人や差別されてる人々の味方になりたいです。音楽には力があると思いますので、その力を使って苦しい時を超える力をどうかあげたいのです。Please check out my website at https://www.ZeroToHiro.comよかったら僕のサイトをチェックしてくださいね、https://www.ZeroToHiro.comThere you can preview some of the songs that might make it onto the EP in their amateur quality conditions!そこでこのEPに出る曲のプレビューを聞くことができます。Please also follow me on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram onhttp://www.facebook.com/Akashi.Musichttp://www.twitter.com/Akashi_RedDeathhttp://www.instagram.com/Akashi.Tokyo以上のフェースブック、ツイッター、インスタグラムとパトリオンサイトでフォローしてください。To have a listen at some of the tracks as previews, please check out this page. You can also hear the full streams of the draft versions of two tracks in this EP for some fun insight into the writing process. https://www.zerotohiro.com/music以上のページでこのEPに入ってる２つのトラックのドラフトを全体的に聞くことが可能です。作曲作りプロセスを少し見れますので面白いと思います。A little more about me?The genre I like to write in is, for lack of a better term, ""Emo"" Alternative Rock with symphonic elements. My favourite bands are: Nano, Shunn, My Chemical Romance, Panic! At the Disco.I'm an avid gamer. My favourite titles are the Nier series, the Persona series, and the Zelda series to name just a few. Playing these games influence me when I compose orchestral music, but that's separate to being a singer-songwriter.僕の一番好きなジャンルはエモっていうロックのサブジャンルです。同時にオーケストラ系ゲームBGM音楽も好きなので、僕の曲にはエモもロックもオーケストラの影響もあります。一番好きなバンドは日本でいうとナノとShunnで、アメリカというとMy Chemical RomanceとPanic! at the Discoです。趣味はビデオゲームで、一番好きなシリーズはニーアとペルソナとゼルダ伝説です。The GistI have decided to run this campaign because, in my preparation for making this EP, I have been learning a lot about how difficult this process can be, both in energy but also financially. In order to become a sustainable artist, one needs to balance a variety of things including marketing, distribution, fan-interaction, etc. however, nothing can begin until the artist moves past the bottleneck which is the production of the first CD. With a product in circulation, the artist is able to more freely work on all the other important things that need to be done to progress in his or her career. Therefore, this campaign is important to me because it is my first major step to becoming an artist here and to be able to cover some of the expenses of producing a debut EP will help us greatly, and once it is done, the bottleneck is overcome and I will be more free to engage in many more exciting activities.このキャンペーンを作ろうとした理由は、EPを準備する中で色々な難しさがあってサポートが必要だからです。特にエージェンシーから独立したアーティストになるには大変お金がかかるので、難しいです。その上に普通ならエージェンシーがやってくれることが色々あって（マーケティング、流通、プロデュース、などなど）、すべてが自分でやらなければなりません。でも、もちろん最初にやらないと何もできないなのは売れるクオリティのCDを作ることです。僕のアーティストとしての最初の一歩ですので、このキャンペーンはすごく大事です。この最初のEPを作ることができたら他のアーティスト活動をはじめるとして色々な扉が開くと思うので、よろしければサポートをしてください。My artist name is Akashi, which can mean many things, but my real name is Hiro. My website is called ZeroToHiro. I have chosen this name because at this very moment, I am literally a Zero. However, with your help right now in supporting my first great step on the journey, I will move towards the goal of becoming Hiro; to move toward becoming my ""true self"", in other words, the ""me"" that I am meant to be"", the ""me"" of the future.アーティスト名意味の多くあるアカシですが、本名はヒロです。サイトはゼロトゥーヒロといいます。どういう意味かというと、僕は今のところはでまだ「ゼロ」で誰にも知られていないけど、いつか必ず「ヒロ」として本当の自分になるんだということです。What We Need & What You GetIn order to create the first EP, I need $2000 USD in order to professionally produce just 4 songs. This price includes hiring of musicians to play for the recording, a professional mixer and recording engineer, and many other things.最初のEPを作るために、4曲で約20万円が必要です。この値段はミュージシャンやレコーディング、ミックスのエンジニアへのギャラなどで、それでもぎりぎりの予算なのです。In addition to the $2000, I require new photos for this project which brings the budget up higher. If you have been following me for a while you may notice I have used the same photos for 6 years now. While they are great, I do need a revamp of my image to suit my style as a singer-songwriter. As a result, a photographer is also required and budgeted. I am also continually taking vocal lessons to ensure that the quality of my work will always be improving.さらにフォトシュートなども必要です。これまでフォローしてくれた方は気づいていると思いますが、僕が今使っている写真は6年前の写真なので、今の新しいイメージの写真が必要なのです。また歌のクオリティをもっともっと上げるためにボーカルレッスンを受け続く必要があります。Here is a rough breakdown:以下は必要な費用の一覧：Mixing and Recording: $250 per songミックスと録音：1曲で2.5万円Hiring an instrumentalist: $100 per instrument, per song.ミュージシャンへのギャラ：１楽器、1曲で1万円Recording Director: $60 per dayレコーディングディレクター：1日で6千円CD Manufacturing: Still UnknownDigital Distribution: Still UnkownPhysical Distribution: Still UnknownCD制作、デジタル配信、流通などいついてはまだはっきりしませんPhotographer: Between $500 to $1200 depending on the Photographer and Qualityフォトグラファーは腕によりますが5万円から12万円くらいです。And these are all at negotiated prices, to give you an indication of how much it costs to make a CD.普通はもっと高いようですが、なんとかお願いしてこれくらいに収まるようにしようと考えています。At this point I am aiming to cut costs by doing the graphic design myself.好きだしコストカットにもなるので、グラフィックデザインは多分自分でやります。If I can reach beyond $2000, I might be able to add more songs and still finish the EP in the projected deadline.この予算で4曲入れられますが、20万円を超えることができれば曲をもっと入れられる可能性があります。I have set the final goal as $6000 because I do not intend to make an EP and retire, I intend to work hard to keep making more and more music. I hope to make a full Album at the end of next year and while 4 tracks cost $2000, I imagine 12 tracks will be much more costly. In this way, it would really help to have a headstart with that funding.ゴールは50万円にした理由は、このEPを完成した後に活動が終わるわけではなくて、そこからフルアルバムを作るために準備したいからです。4曲で20万円でしたらきっと12曲はそれよりもっと高いと思いますので、サポートしてもらえたらすごくありがたいです！If the goal is not reached, I am still going ahead with the EP project so rest assured that 100% of the funds will go toward either the EP or future music endeavours.ゴールに届かなくてもEPは必ず作りますので安心してください。お金はすべて音楽の活動のために使います。Perks!It is difficult to post CDs internationally from Japan. Japan Post seems to have quoted the postage to Australia as $23 Australian dollars, however, I suspect this is incorrect. I have therefore put the shipping as $3 USD for now. Because of this, backers who wish to acquire my EP will receive a digital copy unless I discover a cheaper way to get the physical discs overseas. Backers in Japan have the option to get the physical CDs. Shipping updates will be provided via comments.(Prices are based on average price of songs on iTunes Japan [250 yen per song / Approx $2.5 USD])日本から海外にCDを送るのは結構高くつきます。オーストラリアに送ろうとしたら2千円ぐらいらしいらしいですのでオーストラリアやカナダなどにいらっしゃる方々ならデジタルの方がいいかもしれません。2千円ではないはずだと思いますのでとりあえず3ドルにしました。送料について新しい情報がきましたらアップデートタッブでお知らせ致します。Risks & ChallengesThe challenge for reaching this goal is the risk that working as an artist does not turn out to be sustainable after a period of time.

The only remaining cost is the vinyl pressing. I am a third year NYC Department of Cultural Affairs grant recipient and was awarded the Excellence in the Arts from Staten Island Arts in 2015 for songs I recorded in people's homes around the world, from Atlanta to the Middle East.This project is not-for-profit and with every contribution of $20 or more, a final pressing of this vinyl will be delivered. I hope to see this project finalized by December 16, where I will present the final work at the Newhouse Museum of Contemporary Art in Staten Island, NY. Any funding that exceeds the requested amount will go to Snug Harbor Cultural Center of Staten Island for their help and collaboration on this project.  Special thanks to Brandon Herman for the amazing video of this project and to Megan Leach for the album art. Thank you so much for any support you can give. Even if you can't contribute in dollars please share this project on your social networks.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

We are an important platform in our region for emerging artists.</p>
<p>Through this fundraising campaign, help us put on 10 concerts next season, employ 30 musicians, and utilize 7 local venues. <br/></p>
<p>Community outreach is incredibly important to us - we have initiated several great opportunities for young artists such as:</p>

<h3><b>Our Impact:</b></h3>
<p>Participation in musical ensembles and other classes helps students to develop a sense of teamwork and collaboration, improve critical thinking and problem solving skills, develop creativity, improve spatial, linear, and non-linear reasoning, and so much more.  Beyond any benefits in individual development, music is a vital part of our society and our local and global communities.  It brings people together and offers an undefinable tool for expressing feelings, trends, and thoughts of our times.  </p>
<p>Innumerable
studies show that practicing and performing music may help students’ cognitive
development and stimulate connections in the brain associated with creativity,
decision-making, complex memory. Music is also linked in the improvement of a
student’s ability to process conflicting information from many senses at once and in the development of brain areas associated with language and executive
function.  </p>
<p>In addition to offering musical education to communities that often cannot access high quality programs otherwise, PCM advocates for arts and music funding in schools and local communities. We partner with local schools and other organizations in order to expose more young people to the joys of music.  </p>
<p>Through the years hundreds of students have been involved with our college preparatory programs.  So, d<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">on't just
take our word for it! Watch our video for our students' testimonials and hear about the impact that music has had on their lives.  </span></p>

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">This year, two graduating seniors received full

awards to attend Arizona colleges and other universities around the
country. </span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">As part of the Berklee City Music conference in 2014, PCM
students were able to perform in a jam session with world-renowned guitarist
Kevin Eubanks, learn from other music professionals, and participate in
multiple performance opportunities.</span><br/>

<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Students are connected to a network of local professionals

<p></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Challenges:</h3>
</div>
<p>In order to
offer a low to no-cost program with superb, well-qualified instructors, PCM
must receive a combination of grants and donations in order to supplement paid
lessons and other classes.  </p>
<p>Our goal is
to raise minimum of $5,000 through IndieGoGo to help support the compensation of instructors, the purchase,
maintenance, and upkeep of instruments, rehearsal space, audio equipment and
technology, recruitment and outreach programs, visiting instructors and
clinicians, live concert opportunities for students, and much more.  With
a roster of over 90 students to support, there is a high demand for additional
resources.  </p>
<p><b>Many of our
students would not have access to a high quality, music education program if it
weren’t for PCM.   </b></p>
<p></p><ul>
<li><b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">If we raise $1,500, we would support 1 student in the Music
is Life College Preparatory program</span><br/></b></li>
<li><b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">If we raise $5,000, we would support 3 students</span><br/></b></li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>If we raise $10,000, we would support 7 students</b></span><br/>
</li>
</ul><p></p>
<p>We believe
in our team of teaching artists, our staff, and our students, so we are here to
give them every bit of support possible.  Our instructors are highly
qualified and proven to be up to the challenge of supporting these dedicated
students.  </p>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Even if you can't make a contribution today, you can help us reach our goal.  Share our campaign with your friends.  Post links on your social media pages.  
Even better, if you are so inclined, send the
link to this campaign directly to some close friends and let them know why you
believe in our mission and encourage them to support us as well. Remember, IndieGoGo has lots of sharing tools to make spreading the word easy and convenient.  </p>

development and stimulate connections in the brain associated with creativity,
decision-making, complex memory. Music is also linked in the improvement of a
student’s ability to process conflicting information from many senses at once and in the development of brain areas associated with language and executive
function.  
In addition to offering musical education to communities that often cannot access high quality programs otherwise, PCM advocates for arts and music funding in schools and local communities. We partner with local schools and other organizations in order to expose more young people to the joys of music.  
Through the years hundreds of students have been involved with our college preparatory programs.  So, don't just
take our word for it! Watch our video for our students' testimonials and hear about the impact that music has had on their lives.  


More About Our Impact:



Last year, 12 of our graduating seniors received a total
of $350,000 worth of scholarship offers to attend colleges and universities
across the country.


This year, two graduating seniors received full
scholarships to the Berklee College of Music, and 10 others received scholarship
awards to attend Arizona colleges and other universities around the
country. 


As part of the Berklee City Music conference in 2014, PCM
students were able to perform in a jam session with world-renowned guitarist
Kevin Eubanks, learn from other music professionals, and participate in
multiple performance opportunities.


Students engaging in our College Preparatory ensembles
receive discounted and free concert admission to local venues such as Orpheum
Theater, The Musical Instrument Museum, The Nash (the performance and education
home of Jazz in AZ), local festivals, and more.


Students are connected to a network of local professionals
for specialized instruction even beyond PCM's services.


Students often enjoy higher performance in academic
classes with increased musical participation.


Students self-report huge increases in confidence on stage
and in other settings such as the classroom. 


Students build lasting friendships and professional
relationships.



  Challenges:

In order to
offer a low to no-cost program with superb, well-qualified instructors, PCM
must receive a combination of grants and donations in order to supplement paid
lessons and other classes.  
Our goal is
to raise minimum of $5,000 through IndieGoGo to help support the compensation of instructors, the purchase,
maintenance, and upkeep of instruments, rehearsal space, audio equipment and
technology, recruitment and outreach programs, visiting instructors and
clinicians, live concert opportunities for students, and much more.  With
a roster of over 90 students to support, there is a high demand for additional
resources.  
Many of our
students would not have access to a high quality, music education program if it
weren’t for PCM.   

If we raise $1,500, we would support 1 student in the Music
is Life College Preparatory program
If we raise $5,000, we would support 3 students

If we raise $10,000, we would support 7 students


We believe
in our team of teaching artists, our staff, and our students, so we are here to
give them every bit of support possible.  Our instructors are highly
qualified and proven to be up to the challenge of supporting these dedicated
students.  

Other Ways You Can Help Even if you can't make a contribution today, you can help us reach our goal.  Share our campaign with your friends.  Post links on your social media pages.  
Even better, if you are so inclined, send the
link to this campaign directly to some close friends and let them know why you
believe in our mission and encourage them to support us as well. Remember, IndieGoGo has lots of sharing tools to make spreading the word easy and convenient.  
Thank you so much for all of your support!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>The deal<br/>
</h3> <p>Hey folks! I'm Tom Filepp, the person behind the electronic/experimental project Cars &amp; Trains, based out of Portland, Oregon. After a couple of years break since releasing my 2012 full-length <i>We Are All Fire, </i>I've got a brand new record for you all. My fourth full-length release is called <i>Dust</i>, and is completely instrumental!</p>
<p>The record features walls of analog and granular synthesizers, acoustic instruments, and additional arrangements by the profoundly talented <a href=""http://www.williamryanfritch.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">William Ryan Fritch</a>.</p>
<p>I've released most of my records to date via the amazing label Fake Four, Inc, but decided to self-release this one because I want to keep it simple and release the album on October 16th, earlier than I'd be able to otherwise. I'm going to release the album digitally and via a limited edition cassette edition of 250, with beautiful offset printed packaging.<br/></p>
<p>I'm keeping the release modest and trying to do as much of it as I can myself, but the rest I need to hire folks. Essentially what this boils down to is making things happen, but making sure I'm paying folks like the designer, additional recording engineer, and video editor as close to a fair wage as I can. Anything past that will go to trying to cover production costs on the cassettes and packaging.</p>

The remaining $1000 left after making the perks will go to helping me cover any production costs for the cassettes, packaging, and mastering, which adds up to a little over $1400, all said and done. I can't do it alone, but with your help we can make this happen. I also love the idea of making this record a project we're all essentially a part of.</p>

<p>The Philanthro team originates from a third-generation, local heating and air conditioning company founded in 1954...we've been in the industry over 60 years!  We're located in Monroe, Ohio, just north of Cincinnati.  We've always emphasized the importance of family values like honesty, integrity, and service to others.  Our experience in the HVAC industry and our focus on giving back to the community set the stage for the launch of Philanthro.</p>
<p></p>

<p>In 2006, Will Housh founded the ecommerce company Housh, Inc. and launched our first online store.  In 2013, we launched our flagship website HVAC.com, one of the world's leading online marketplaces for heating and air conditioning products, services, and helpful information.</p>
<p>Will is Philanthro's founder and CEO.  Ever since going on his first mission trip to Mexico (with Back2Back Ministries) in 1998, he's had an insatiable passion to help orphans and vulnerable children.  Will’s passion is contagious and it motivates everyone in his presence (ask anyone who knows him).  He and the whole Philanthro team are determined to see Philanthro succeed.<br/></p>

<p>For the past five years, our company has taken volunteers from our team on company-sponsored international mission trips in partnership with Back2Back Ministries.  The company pays for all trip expenses and extends an extra week of paid vacation to the team members so they can serve without reservations.</p>

<p>We get very excited about rolling up our sleeves and serving the kids.  We have always yearned for an opportunity to engage our customers and suppliers in the cause.  After a lot of brainstorming about how to raise awareness and make a bigger impact in the lives of orphans around the world, the idea for Philanthro was born.</p>

You can support our project today and we will follow up with you via email to confirm your filter size.Philanthro is an exciting new brand of air filters with a charitable mission to transform the lives of orphans and vulnerable children around the world.  Every time a Philanthro product is purchased, we donate at least 20% of the proceeds to fund international mission trips and support holistic orphan-care charities.Most of us replace our furnace filters on a regular basis.  Furnace filters have traditionally been a boring commodity item purchased from a brand without a compelling mission.Philanthro is different.  When you join us and choose a high-quality Philanthro furnace filter instead, you know you are making a big difference for a child who needs our help.Please read the rest of our story below!We donate at least 20% of every Philanthro purchase to fund international mission trips and support holistic orphan-care charities.How can we afford to donate this much?  We have a small team and we run lean. We keep overhead costs low and we're scrappy with our marketing budget.  We accept lower profit margins...on purpose.Why? Because our #1 goal is to help as many orphans as possible.  We like running a solid business, but we really love helping the kids we serve.    Philanthro filters are engineered to deliver the same (or better) air filtration as the leading brands found at home improvement and other retail stores.  We've been in the heating and air conditioning industry for a long time and we designed Philanthro furnace filters with high standards in mind.All Philanthro filters carry a MERV 11 rating.  MERV stands for Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value.  The higher the MERV, the better the filtration.We carry all filter sizes.*If you don't know your filter size, that's okay! You can support our project today and we will follow up with you via email to confirm your filter size.According to UNICEF, the international orphan crisis affects more than 163,000,000 (163 MILLION) children around the world.  They range in age from infants to teenagers, all without a family to meet the most basic needs.  Children are orphaned for a wide range of reasons, including war, poverty, natural disasters, and abandonment.  If all these children were grouped together, they would constitute the 10th largest country in the world - an entire nation of vulnerable children, left to fend for themselves.163 million is a number that is difficult for most of us to wrap our heads around.  We can agree that whatever the reason for family failure, children should not be the ones to pay the price.  How do we address such an enormous challenge?  One child at a time.  At Philanthro, our company mission statement is ""To transform the way people purchase products that improve their comfort, health, and happiness, as we transform the lives of orphans and widows around the world.""
We believe that we have an important duty to love, protect, and care for the most vulnerable people in our society, and we've built a company that channels a large portion of its financial success toward this cause.  We strive to provide care for today, and hope for tomorrow, for orphans and vulnerable children around the world by rolling up our sleeves on international orphan care mission trips and by funding select non-profit organizations that develop thoughtful, sustainable programs to make a long-term difference in the lives of these children.



In living out a higher calling, we desire to transform lives around the world and play a central role in meeting the needs of orphans and vulnerable children, from family preservation and adoption to provision for specific physical, social, educational, emotional & spiritual needs.

By incorporating ""social good"" into our business model and involving our customers in the cause, we can make a sustainable and scalable difference in the world.  We aim to have a positive impact for tens of thousands of children.  We envision Philanthro growing and becoming a household name and extending into new product categories.  We eventually want to see Philanthro on the shelves at major retailers and in homes and businesses around the world.  As Philanthro grows and more people join our cause, we will be in a position to give back even more.


Every time you join us in this cause by purchasing a Philanthro product, you are making a choice that makes a difference in the life of a child!
Please join us!  Support this project, make the choice to purchase Philanthro air filters, and tell your friends and family so they can join us too.





Back2Back Ministries is our primary non-profit partner.  When you choose a Philanthro product, you're helping us channel more resources to serve orphans in places like Mexico, Haiti, Nigeria and India.


Members of the Philanthro team have been serving with Back2Back on international mission trips since 1998 and our team members have donated over 10,000 combined hours serving alongside Back2Back in countries all over the world.



Back2Back has been impacting the lives of orphans and vulnerable children since 1997.  Through their 5-Point Child Development Plan, they strive to provide holistic care to each child they serve, meeting spiritual, physical, educational, emotional, and social needs to help kids overcome their life circumstances and break free from the cycle of generational poverty.


Learn more about Back2Back from this awesome video!





The Philanthro team originates from a third-generation, local heating and air conditioning company founded in 1954...we've been in the industry over 60 years!  We're located in Monroe, Ohio, just north of Cincinnati.  We've always emphasized the importance of family values like honesty, integrity, and service to others.  Our experience in the HVAC industry and our focus on giving back to the community set the stage for the launch of Philanthro.


In 2006, Will Housh founded the ecommerce company Housh, Inc. and launched our first online store.  In 2013, we launched our flagship website HVAC.com, one of the world's leading online marketplaces for heating and air conditioning products, services, and helpful information.
Will is Philanthro's founder and CEO.  Ever since going on his first mission trip to Mexico (with Back2Back Ministries) in 1998, he's had an insatiable passion to help orphans and vulnerable children.  Will’s passion is contagious and it motivates everyone in his presence (ask anyone who knows him).  He and the whole Philanthro team are determined to see Philanthro succeed.

For the past five years, our company has taken volunteers from our team on company-sponsored international mission trips in partnership with Back2Back Ministries.  The company pays for all trip expenses and extends an extra week of paid vacation to the team members so they can serve without reservations.


We get very excited about rolling up our sleeves and serving the kids.  We have always yearned for an opportunity to engage our customers and suppliers in the cause.  After a lot of brainstorming about how to raise awareness and make a bigger impact in the lives of orphans around the world, the idea for Philanthro was born.
We are super excited to invite you to join the Philanthro ""team"" by supporting this project, helping us launch Philanthro, choosing to use our air filters in your home or office, and even joining us on a mission trip!  Please contact us so we can tell you more about our vision and see how you can get involved.  We'd love to hear from you!







We invite you to join us as we change the lives of orphans around the world, one child at a time.  The need is great, and now with Philanthro everyone can do something to help!
Please join us today and back this project.  Click the pink ""Contribute Now"" button at the top of this page to support Philanthro and choose from one of the exciting perks!
Together we will make a huge difference for orphans and vulnerable children around the world!





Where do I enter my filter size?When you contribute to this Indiegogo campaign and choose a perk that includes Philanthro air filters, you do not enter your filter size during checkout.  We will follow up with you via email/phone at the end of our campaign to make sure to ship you the correct filter size!

Now this is going to
sound cheesy, but when we started this band it was simply about
connecting together through the beautiful language of
music. Ouch, it's even cheesier now that I see it written
down..Oh well, it's true, and I've already started now, so I better go on..​.<br/>Four years later,
and this connection is stronger than ever. Our music has brought us
to amazing places, performing for wonderful audiences along the way.
The three of us have been blessed to
share our music with many people, and we would love to
welcome you into
DINOSAUR's world!<br/><br/><i>( No, we are not opening an amusement park
called  'Dinosaur's World', filled with clones of extinct
vertebrates...We are a band that makes music. Passionate music.
Music that comes from a deep place within us, which we cannot
express simply through words. For that, you will just have to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjGPI7vUWlE"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">listen to it. </a>)</i><br/><br/>Ehh anyways, the time has come
for DINOSAUR to record our first album. While this is an
exciting prospect, right now it is simply a dream. We cannot do it
alone, and need your help to make it a reality.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Who Are DINOSAUR?<br/>
</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Aengus, Mauricio and
Maya met while studying at the Conservatory of Amsterdam, one of
Europe's finest music schools. These three persons, from three
different countries, with three different backgrounds, came together
through one shared love, music.</p>
<p>
Bringing together
our influences from Ireland, Colombia and Russia, we formed DINOSAUR
in 2011. Touching on areas as different as jazz, rock, film music and
Latin-American folk, our sound is constantly
evolving. <br/>These past four
years together, writing music and exploring creative ideas, have been
a lot of fun. By far the best part has been sharing our music with
all of the folks we have been fortunate enough to play for. Last year
we did our first tour of Ireland, a truly inspiring experience. After
playing to crowds all over the country, we were blessed enough to
finish up at the National Concert Hall of Ireland!<br/>Along the way, we
received many heartwarming reactions from admirers and fans. They
described to us the vivid imagery they pictured whilst listening to
us perform. Time and time again, we were asked: “Do you have an album?”
And time and time again, we sadly answered no..Well, the time has
come for that album to be made! 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Despite
all the marvellous experiences we have had, DINOSAUR's story has
not been without its challenges. Soon the three of us will live in
three separate countries, on two separate continents! Most bands
would probably quit at this point. But then again, we are not most
bands. Music is much more than a career to us, it is a way of
life..Our opportunity to express ourselves, as well as the moving
responses of those we share it with, are
inspiration for us to find a way to continue. 
</p>
<p>
But, in order to do
this, we need your help. As an independent band, without the support
of a record label, we cannot afford all of the costs involved in making this
album. We are asking you to help us fund the production of this
album. In doing so, you will become a creator of a permanent work
of art, with emotion and committment behind each and every note. As
well as this, it will give a massive jumpstart to our careers,
opening doors far beyond even this album.</p>

Little did she know that while my Mom was distracting her upstairs, we were swapping her rental harp with her new harp downstairs.  It was a day to remember and Isabella was overwhelmed with emotion and lots and lots of tears (see video above for the reveal!).</p><p>Thank you again to all of you that supported her in her dream.  All 84 of your names were engraved on a plaque that was also presented to her on that same evening.  She will never forget this wonderful day!</p><p>God bless you and your families!</p><p>****************************************************************************</p><p>Isabella recently turned 10 and has been playing harp since the age of six. Her love for the harp has grown exponentially along with her talent. Playing the harp has become part of her daily life- practicing 2 hours a day.  Isabella has placed at all three of the competitions she has entered in the last two years (see <a href=""https://youtu.be/p5imJ2zguWw"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">video</a> of entry in <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/a-harp-for-isabella/x/12095826#/gallery"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">gallery</a>).</p><p>After playing on rental harps for the last four years, a new opportunity to purchase a used harp came our way. Isabella has been able to play on this Lyon &amp; Healy Style 23 harp  a few times-built sometime in the 1980's-  and she fell in love with it immediately!!!  </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442818462/aairo2omivzoxlg60kmc.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 87.7315px; height: 152px;""/></p><p>We knew that Isabella would be needing to upgrade to a full sized Concert Grand harp sometime this year, but with the extremely high cost of new harps ($32K+), we were expecting that we'd have to search for a rental harp.

Little did she know that while my Mom was distracting her upstairs, we were swapping her rental harp with her new harp downstairs.  It was a day to remember and Isabella was overwhelmed with emotion and lots and lots of tears (see video above for the reveal!).Thank you again to all of you that supported her in her dream.  All 84 of your names were engraved on a plaque that was also presented to her on that same evening.  She will never forget this wonderful day!God bless you and your families!****************************************************************************Isabella recently turned 10 and has been playing harp since the age of six. Her love for the harp has grown exponentially along with her talent. Playing the harp has become part of her daily life- practicing 2 hours a day.  Isabella has placed at all three of the competitions she has entered in the last two years (see video of entry in gallery).After playing on rental harps for the last four years, a new opportunity to purchase a used harp came our way. Isabella has been able to play on this Lyon & Healy Style 23 harp  a few times-built sometime in the 1980's-  and she fell in love with it immediately!!!  We knew that Isabella would be needing to upgrade to a full sized Concert Grand harp sometime this year, but with the extremely high cost of new harps ($32K+), we were expecting that we'd have to search for a rental harp. Fortunately, we came across this great harp and it's being sold by only it's second owner.  It has had very little 'mileage' and is in great condition. The tone is rich and Isabella's sound and pedal changes are a complete improvement from all her previous harps.The total cost of this harp, after the purchase of a transport cover set, the necessary harp regulation ('tune-up') and new strings- will end up costing about $20,000. We think we could personally come up with half of this amount at this time.  For the last two years, we have had friends, family and even strangers suggest that we create a funding page to raise money for Isabella's 'future' harp because they want to help.

Most of my friends and family know me well and the music that I have been blessed of God to teach, play, sing, write, and record over the course of my life and career. But there has been more dreams in my heart that have yet to be fulfilled. <b>I believe now is the time to see another dream fulfilled because this one carries another very special purpose for others who either enjoy or maybe need the music that I am about to create to help them. </b>This is the reason I want to share the news of an exciting project that I will be working on this fall in this new chapter of my life and music ministry. </p><p><b>My Project</b></p><p>I am preparing to go back into the studio this fall, and with the help of my friends Steve Clarke and Clint Curtis of Sevenview Studios, Springdale, NL, I will record TWO uniquely creative instrumental LP albums, one entitled ""Healing Colors,"" and the other, entitled ""My Peaceful Place."" <b>Besides creating the albums for the enjoyment of the listener, these recordings are specifically intended to be shared with people who struggle with any type of mental, emotional, or physical disease,  and with those who have been diagnosed with special needs or developmental or learning disabilities. </b>The music will also be of benefit to anyone dealing with everyday stress, anxiety, and grief in that each song selection will be intentionally created to be a soothing, uplifting, and peaceful place for any listener. As the saying goes, <i><b>""Sometimes music is the only medicine the heart and </b><b>soul needs."" </b></i> Everyone loves a ""spa"" and this music is meant be a tool to take any listener to a place of peace and relaxation simply because of the heavenly atmosphere that I will endeavor to create as I play each selection spontaneously. </p><p><b>My Purpose</b></p><p>The term ""Tehillah Music Source"" or TMS, as I have coined the phrase, is summed up in a brief definition (see below) of what I have used at Freedom Victory Centre (our non-profit Ministry Centre,) for various promotion ads of our weekly ""Tehillah Music Source"" night for people with special needs. I started facilitating this weekly event since January 2015 and there's been such a ongoing flow of musical creativity flowing out of my heart. We have continued to receive very favorable and positive feedback of how the music has been of great help and benefit to those who are attending, parents and caregivers included. Positively unique behavioral changes have been taking place in a couple individuals with autism, for instance. It's very exciting for me to share this gift of creativity as an inspiration to them! As a worship leader, I know that I am making room for a new expression of heaven's music that God wants me to share with those who need healing, freedom, peace, or simply an encounter with God's love. This particular project has been a dream of mine for about 20 years and now I can see it coming to pass. <b>People have been asking if I have any of this TMS music recorded on CD or available as digital downloads via the iTunes. I have assured them that it is forthcoming. It's obvious to me that it is the right time for me to get it out there to bless others! </b></p><p><b>Definition of TMS</b></p><b>

<p>MINISTRY – THE BAND</p>
<p>Hi, I’m Professional Photographer Omar Mena!</p>
<p>Since the Buck Satan and the 666 Shooters promo shots, I’ve
had the pleasure of capturing behind the scenes footage and photography of candid
moments during Ministry’s time at the compound in El Paso, as well as promo
shots, of the band. Included is footage from the Relapse sessions, rehearsals and From Beer
to Eternity; all images are candid, beautiful and many unreleased
footage/images.</p>
<p>So, with Ministry’s blessing, we have compiled a one of a
kind opportunity to put together over 100 images in a comic book style format.
Since we are pressing only a limited number of the comic book; we are needing
your help to make this happen.</p>
<p>The comic book style book is a limited edition run only. So,
please do us a favor by pre-ordering the book that ships on Halloween. </p>
<p>THE DOCUMENTARY</p>
<p>This documentary is full of unreleased footage from sessions
that were left out of the webisodes from all the different campaigns I did for
all three albums for Ministry.</p>
<p>The footage also includes footage of Tommy Victor (Prong,
Ministry, Danzig), Tony Campos (Soulfly, Static X and Fear Factor) and many
more special appearances.</p>
<p>Footage like this will not be made available again in the
future and just like the comic, will be available in limited qualities.</p>
<p>Please help us with pre-orders so we can make this
documentary work. </p>
<p>WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR YOU?</p>
<p>We have a bunch of perks available to you, the uber-Ministry
fan. Everything from a discount on pre-ordering the comic and documentary together; as
well as the opportunity to have limited edition prints, to getting the chance to

</div></div>","MINISTRY – THE BAND
Hi, I’m Professional Photographer Omar Mena!
Since the Buck Satan and the 666 Shooters promo shots, I’ve
had the pleasure of capturing behind the scenes footage and photography of candid
moments during Ministry’s time at the compound in El Paso, as well as promo
shots, of the band. Included is footage from the Relapse sessions, rehearsals and From Beer
to Eternity; all images are candid, beautiful and many unreleased
footage/images.
So, with Ministry’s blessing, we have compiled a one of a
kind opportunity to put together over 100 images in a comic book style format.
Since we are pressing only a limited number of the comic book; we are needing
your help to make this happen.
The comic book style book is a limited edition run only. So,
please do us a favor by pre-ordering the book that ships on Halloween. 
THE DOCUMENTARY
This documentary is full of unreleased footage from sessions
that were left out of the webisodes from all the different campaigns I did for
all three albums for Ministry.
The footage also includes footage of Tommy Victor (Prong,
Ministry, Danzig), Tony Campos (Soulfly, Static X and Fear Factor) and many
more special appearances.
Footage like this will not be made available again in the
future and just like the comic, will be available in limited qualities.
Please help us with pre-orders so we can make this
documentary work. 
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR YOU?
We have a bunch of perks available to you, the uber-Ministry
fan. Everything from a discount on pre-ordering the comic and documentary together; as
well as the opportunity to have limited edition prints, to getting the chance to
advertise your business or band alongside the legendary Ministry.
ALL WE NEED IS YOUR SUPPORT
Thank you for being part of this special offering from
Ministry. The band is completely grateful for your support and look forward to
offering you a one of a kind item that you won’t be able to get anywhere else
except through this Indiegogo campaign.

<p>It's been a joy and a privilege to meet so many of you guys and make art with you since the early 2000s with <i>Felonious Groove Foundation</i> and then on to my solo indie-folk project <i>Cali Shaw</i> <i>Band </i>which began in 2011. My music career is just a leaf on the tree of incredible things being made by independent folks just like me. But I'm so happy to be <i>your</i> leaf.</p>
<p>I'm finishing up my 2nd Cali Shaw Band studio album now, titled <i><b>Under The Olive Tree</b></i>.  Over the past year in Albuquerque we have recorded and produced an album that is lush and fully orchestrated.  It sounds <i>fantastic </i>and I can't wait to share it with you!</p>
<p>The album features:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The talent and sounds of incredible local musicians</span></li>
<li><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> Full vocals and harmonies, whistles, vintage Gibson guitars, enchanting vibraphones, some big fat upright bass, and even a horn section!</span></li>
<li><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">8 new original songs and a new folksy train march cover of ""Over the Rainbow"".</span></li>
</ul>
<p> I am making this album so that you can sing or whistle along and drum your hands on your steering wheel, your desk or anywhere that you like.  So join me and let's finish this record together!</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get.</h3>
<p>Making a professional album is expensive, between hiring the best musicians around, manufacturing the CDs, posters and T-shirts, and hiring artists for the CD art and other promotional costs.  The tab for the project is several thousand dollars. (Ouch!)</p>
<p>With the majority of the the project already completed, we need to raise  $2500 for the final push; getting this album pressed, packaged, and out to you and the rest of the world's indie-folk music lovers.</p>
<p>Anything extra will go towards promoting the album and producing an awesome music video for the song ""<i>Hold On to You</i>"".</p>
<p>The perks for your contribution are pretty straight forward and include everything from a digital download of the album to signed CDs, posters, T-shirts, a guest-list spot at the album release parties, and even a house concert at your home!</p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal of $2500, you will still receive all of the perks that your contribution paid for.  </p>
<p>So, please help spread the word!  Friends help friends fund good, local music.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>This project is important to me for a number of reasons. Let's start with the title. <i>FLOAT</i> is an acronym. <b>Freely Living Only At Times</b>, which simply means you've got to learn how to control your emotions and not let them control you. </p>
<p>I wrote + produced this entire project over the course of a year and a half. It was done during a period of time in my life where I wasn't capable of practicing what I preached so I put it into my art to rid myself of the thoughts that started to keep me captive. There's an underlying message: You've got to be and whatever you feel like BEING is, you take that and run with it.</p>
<p>I am by no means saying that this album is going to change the world, but, there's somebody out there that doesn't know I exist and we probably share the same stories and they need to hear what I've audibly written for them. This EP is also the first part of a trilogy, this is only the beginning...</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Challenges</h3> <p>Being an artist, although exciting and fulfilling as my purpose in life, it is a struggle. The struggle is being independent and having to carry the burden of an entire team on your back. But, I've never complained because this is what I love.</p>
<p>I live for imagery, visuals, words that paint a picture and beats that wake your spirit when it's asleep. The difference between me and a lot of other artist is that I trust my struggle. I know that what I am being given is only a set up for the future so I take every moment as a learning experience and handle it in stride.</p>
<p>I've never asked for a handout and I damn sure don't want one because success that last doesn't happen overnight. With that said, I always find ways to make my vision come to life, but, the bigger picture can't be captured alone. I need your help to frame it all perfectly.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441153268/pdywmtzycffu1dq4excm.png"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; width: 621px; height: 621px; background-color: initial;""/></p>

    Challenges Being an artist, although exciting and fulfilling as my purpose in life, it is a struggle. The struggle is being independent and having to carry the burden of an entire team on your back. But, I've never complained because this is what I love.
I live for imagery, visuals, words that paint a picture and beats that wake your spirit when it's asleep. The difference between me and a lot of other artist is that I trust my struggle. I know that what I am being given is only a set up for the future so I take every moment as a learning experience and handle it in stride.
I've never asked for a handout and I damn sure don't want one because success that last doesn't happen overnight. With that said, I always find ways to make my vision come to life, but, the bigger picture can't be captured alone. I need your help to frame it all perfectly.
    Other Ways You Can Help If you aren't able to contribute monetarily, here are a few ways you can support:  Share this campaign link (using the indiegogo share tools) on your social media pages, encouraging people to donate.

</p><p><b>My
Story</b></p>
<p>Howdy!! Amanda Raye here! </p>
<p>I am a singer/songwriter from St.
Louis, Missouri. I’ve been singing since I can remember, and writing songs for the
last 6 years. Recently, I got the hankering to start my own project to put my
original music together as a collection. My good friend Julie says these are my
“Heart Songs” from my heart to yours. I am excited and enthused to bring them
to the table and share my art with all of you! </p>
<p>David and I decided that our
girls would be better off in Missouri with our families until I finished this
project and could get back to them. This was truly the hardest decision of my
life, but I had to do what was best for them and for their Mama. Finishing this
work is extremely important to my career and to them. The benefit of having a
mother not afraid to do the work to make something of herself will serve them
greatly in the future. We are doing great work and
working diligently. I miss my girls more than anything, but they are happy and
well taken care of by David and our families. I must finish this work, and get
back to my babies, swiftly!</p>
<p><b>My
Goal – The Breakdown</b></p>
<p>My goal of 7,000 gets broken down like
this…</p>
<p>A portion goes to all the fantastic
musicians who have contributed to this album. Tony Mata, David Mills, Rich Mossman - to name a few. I don’t play an instrument well
enough to record – so we hired some amazing people to do all the heavy lifting for
us. Let’s not forget the lovely vocalists who lent a hand as well!</p>
<p>A portion goes to my Dad for getting me
started. He was my main investor and was so gracious to get me going on this
project! Thanks for believing in me Dad!! </p>
<p>A portion will cover the production and studio
costs of my album. A lot of hours have been put into this record to get it
sounding this amazing. I must compensate the blood, sweat and tears put into my
art!</p>
<p>A large portion goes to the CD’s and
Vinyl copies that we’re ordering! Also, not to forget the all important, ‘Amanda
Raye’ Merch!!</p>
<p>I’ve got some cool perks too! I’m
excited to personalize CD’s, Vinyl, maybe write a ditty or two or make a funny video with one of you!!! </p>
<p>If our goal isn’t reached, whatever is
raised will be taken care of in the order mentioned previously. until it runs
out. I believe it is of the utmost importance to repay the efforts of those
around us. That means musicians, my producer and my Dad. Hopefully Dad doesn’t get
a collection agency after me…haha, that’s a joke.. Love you Dad!!</p><p>As we continue this work, I have had many friends and family ask if I would consider making this my debut Full-Length album...we are considering doing so, but of course the issue of time and resources stands in the way. If this campaign goes the way I am hoping it does....we just may have enough to make it happen!! </p>
<p><b>From
My Heart to Yours – My Plan</b></p>
<p>I’ve been singing since I was a baby.
Ever since I could form words, I have loved the impact music has had on my
heart and soul. I have been passionate about music my entire life. Music
inspires, uplifts, supports, and ties us all together. There is no doubt that
music is a unifying entity in our world. When I write, it comes from deep
within my heart and soul. I am displaying everything that is so sacred inside
of my heart, for all of you to hear. I want to be the song floating around in
your head every day, in your heart. I want you all to know that I’m not afraid
to share who I am with all of you, and to encourage you to reciprocate. We are
all we have, we need to feed and water our souls. Every one of us. </p>
<p>I plan to move to Nashville once this
work is completed. I believe in this project, in these songs and in myself. I
think I have what it takes, and I need to reach for that dream while I have the
courage. I don’t know if I will be a success, or if I will just share what I
have with all of you and that will be the great thing I did with my music…but I
know that either way, I will be doing what gives my heart Joy. I will be
showing my beautiful little girls that they should and can reach for their
dreams, no matter how huge they seem. Failure is in not trying. </p>
<p>One other thing,<span>  if I have had the pleasure of meeting you, I
hope that you understood the purity my heart holds…and that, I understand and
am grateful for every kind gesture, hug, word…all of it has motivated me to do
this and without that, this would have been much more difficult a dream to
dream. Thank you, from my heart to yours.

The funds that we will raise will  be used for the production  of the songs like musical engineering, mastering, studio rentals and other production and recording expenses. The album will be sold during Teach Peace Build Peace Movement Events to raise more funds and help teach peace to more children in our adopted schools and communities in Mindanao,  Philippines. You will not only help our voice be heard through our music but you will also be able to help us raise more funds for the children in conflict areas. If by some way you will not be able to donate cash, you can still help us reach our goal by being part of our Love Society and conduct any of the following: 1. Email this campaign to your friends.2. Share this campaign in your social media accounts.3. Blog about our campaign and share our story to the world!  4.

I also happen to have grown up with these guys as Ben Meyer was my neighbor, and also I was a room mate at his house twice in my life. I was a roadie for Nasty Savage for Ben Meyer, as well as for Richard Bateman. In fact Richard is more family than friend to me in fact. Any way after the band broke up I said there is no damn fan club for the band, and the web site for the band was pretty bad. (just a logo). So I formed the official fan club for the band, and the fans came running, from all over the world to join the official fan club facebook site, and the 600+ fans are die hard. So I said damn we need a tee shirt for the fans to help spread the word of this fan club. </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>The reason I am doing this is I am trying to help raise money for a movie. I happen to be a film maker, doing my own damn movie. In fact my 11th full length movie. It also happens to be my first comedy. That is if any money is made. These Shirts have to be premade and every quote I have gotten is over $500.00. I started thinking damn, blood, sweat, tears (the band break up) for my favorite band for years, and I have never asked a DIME from any member for my hard work. </p>
<p>So what do you get? You get a Nasty Savage 2 sided tee shirt, one with the classic ORIGINAL old school logo, and on the back it says NASTY SAVAGE fan club, and the official link to the page. <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/groups/NastySavageOfficialFanClub/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/groups/NastySavageOfficialFanClub/</a></p>

<p>Hello and welcome to Team LNJO!  Co-led by Ian Roller and David Shorr, we are an 18-piece Big Band that features some of the best musical talents you can find in LA-performers and composers alike.  It is our mission to serve as the glue between the past, present, and the future of the Big Band tradition.  Established in February 2012, we've had some exciting performing and recording opportunities, bringing other people's music to life.  But now, it's about time we show the world what Team LNJO is all about and record our own debut album!!</p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The Plan</span><br/>
</h3> <p></p>
<p>Our plan is to record our debut album in the Summer, and release it early Winter this year!  Can you feel it?  The time is FAST approaching!!</p>
<p>Producing an 18-piece Big Band album is no simple task.  To do it right, we need to pay for studio time at a large scoring stage, top notch recording/mixing/mastering engineers, the musicians' valuable time and talents, an artist for the album artwork, printing, pressing, and several other nominal costs.</p>
<p>But we can't just record the album and leave hundreds of copies around to clutter our desks!…if a major label spends x-amount to record and produce an album, it'll spend easily well over triple that figure on promotion and distribution costs.  Our total goal accounts for some extent of promotion; however, any pledges that take us above and beyond our goal will be used to further promote our album, Team LNJO, and the power of a large Jazz Orchestra!</p>
<p>And might I add that Drum Magazine's 2015 Jazz Percussionist of the year, Nick Mancini, will be guesting on the album!  In case you haven't seen his unofficial ""teaser"" video for the campaign: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=1027392527275537"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=1027392527275537</a></p>

</p><p>I was a shy insecure boy growing up in rural Ohio. I was afraid most of my life. I was closeted, suicidal, depressed. My life, frankly, just sucked. I never wanted to go to college, but because my family said that was what I was suppose to do, I went to a local University and hated every minute I was there. I literally had nothing going for me. Until in 2009 I watched the Grammy's, and in particular I watch my favorite artist, P!nk, perform ""Glitter in The Air"". It changed my life. It was so majestic. In that moment I told myself that's what I am going to do. About a year later I found myself on The X Factor stage in front of 4,000 people including Simon Cowell, Demi Lovato, and Kelly Rowland. That was the big turning point in my career. The next year I found myself on a different TV series, American Idol, where I got to perform for J-Lo, Keith Urban, and Harry Connick Jr. It was just an incredible experience to be apart of and I am so blessed to have done both shows. Since then I have been On YouTube for the past year and have over 200,000 people that have clicked the subscribe button on my channel. Now it's time for me to create something that I can call my own. This EP has been 3 years of writing my ass off to get something I am happy and proud of. Recording and making music videos is very expensive, and that is where I need all of YOUR HELP! I have 5 songs I am recording and want to do a music video for my single, as it has it's own personality that would come across brilliantly in video form. I realistically need to raise around $30,000 to do what I want to do, but $20,00 is a good place to start! I hope you will help me create something that means so much to me. The journey begins now. </p>
<p>The Breakdown:</p>
<p>-Recording per song: $1,000 (Studio/Mixing/Mastering)</p>
<p>-5 songs * $1000= $5,000</p><p>-Video costs for my single: $15,000 (Recording space, production, props etc) (price agreed upon by videographer)</p>
<p>-Lyric Video= $600 (Not budgeted for but if we raise more this will be paid off too)</p>

I was prompted to record a jazz album after having been shortlisted as Best Jazz Vocalist Scotland 2013. I'm putting music in the heart of my art! It's been said I'm a ""unique lady songstress"", a ""gloriously multifarious"" performer with a voice that has ""the power to endure ready tears"". Nigel and I worked together 7 years ago on a theatre piece and said then to get in touch when I was ready to sing jazz - so I did! NIGEL CLARK | Nigel has worked with some of the biggest names in jazz and popular music. Recent recordings include his solo album Under The Stars (Circular Records) and Day Of The Duo a guitar duets album with Irish jazz guitarist Hugh Buckley. “Clark’s jazz improvisations … are in our opinion representative of the highest possible level in creative virtuosity” – Contemporary Music Network.WHAT WE'VE CREATED  A RECORD | of time, of love, of loneliness, of longing, of jazz. We’ve
carefully carved this album of classic jazz tunes and hope we have honored the warmth, beauty and truth
that a classic collection can bring. It’s a very simple, unedited offering. Deliberately minimal, intimately recorded live over two days in Stuart’s
beautiful studio; our host, engineer and mastering mastermind.
For me, Jude, they
are late night lullabies, songs that I have loved and learnt from and through
with a guitarist that I have long admired and trusted in his musical integrity. [Jude | I live in Glasgow and Nigel now lives in Dublin hence my singing alone under a bridge!

<p>Vive em mim uma grande vontade de fazer nascer o meu <b>segundo álbum de músicas originais </b>com tonalidades e cores portuguesas. Este surge como um registo da energia que emergiu da minha viagem à Selva Amazónica em Janeiro de 2015 e os meses que se seguiram em Portugal. </p>

<p>Ao dar continuidade à linha do primeiro álbum “SOLay” que, em <i>Quechua</i> - a língua ancestral da cordilheira dos Andes -, significa <i>Semear</i>, a <i>semente</i> cria <b>raiz</b>. Nutrida da intenção de conhecer o que está mais profundo e de chegar ao <b>coração</b> do mundo, o nome deste próximo álbum será <b><i>Coraçāo emRaiz.</i></b></p>

<p><b>∞</b></p>
<p>A próxima fase, juntará <b>músicos portugueses</b> que me inspiram e que complementam as minhas composições. </p>

<p>Assim como o primeiro álbum, o <i><b>Coraçāo emRaíz</b></i> contará com um pequeno <b>livro</b>* das letras e desenhos da minha autoria, desta vez inspirados nas <b>formas tradicionais portuguesas</b> que ganharāo vida com a magia de Marta Valente. </p>

</b><p><b>SOBRE MIM</b></p>
<p>Nasci no Porto, Portugal, e desde pequena, mesmo antes de falar, que debitava o meu próprio idioma com sons inventados. </p>
<p>A música sempre cresceu em mim intuitivamente, acompanhando as minhas escolhas e aprendizagens. No início por imitação e depois criando uma dança própria, ela foi ganhando forma e tornou-se a minha grande companheira.</p>
<p>Fui bebendo de algumas fontes: estudei percussão árabe; canto carnático na Índia; aprendi cantos tradicionais de várias partes do mundo; fiz a Universidade de Música em canto Jazz e descobri a música de intervenção em Portugal. Paralelamente, cultivei livremente o experimentar de novos sons e possibilidades, novas texturas e… a minha voz.</p>
<p>Hoje, as melodias que me habitam, vivem de um profundo e consciente amor pela Natureza e pela existência que me traz criações que tocam o coração das pessoas. Adoro viajar e sentir o bonito de cada “canto” do mundo, deixando-me inspirar por essas culturas e suas expressões. </p>
<p>Semeei pela primeira vez no mundo com o meu Álbum “SOLay”, financiado por uma campanha <i>crowdfunding</i> que contou com a contribuição de mais de 100 pessoas. Criado no Peru e lançado em Outubro de 2014, abriu caminho para continuar a partilhar o que de melhor tenho para dar.</p>

<b></b><p>Hello <b>Family</b> and <b>Friends</b>!</p>
<p>I greet each one of you <b>warmly</b> and with a heart filled with new melodies to share and launch into the <b>World</b>.</p>
<p>I bring you good <b>news</b>!</p>
<p>Within me lives a great desire of bringing to life <b>my second album of original songs </b>with portuguese colors and shades. It arises as a record of my trip to the Amazon Jungle and the following months in Portugal.</p>
<p>Here is a call to all of you who feel like taking a part on this project. By supporting this campaign you will be actively participating in the realization of this new album, therefore turning my dream into a common reality.</p>
<p><b>∞</b></p>
<p><b>PROJECT</b></p>
<p>Following the same line of the first album ""SOlay"", that in Quechua- the ancestral language of the Andes - means “to sow”, now the seed grows into a <b>root </b>(in Portuguese <b>root</b> means <i>raiz</i>). Nurtured with this intention of digging deeper to reach the core, the <b>heart </b>(<i>coração)</i> of the world, the name of this next album comes to be “<i>Coração emRaiz”</i>.</p>
<p>Giving voice to the spirit of the land that gave me birth, and the culture of my roots, this album shall be sung in <b>Portuguese, </b>along with the language that my own heart creates.</p>
<p>∞</p>
<p>The first stage of <b>sound recording</b> is already taking place in the south of Portugal, on top of Serra da Breijeira, in the <i>Nazca Music Studio</i>. This studio lives on sustainable energies, making this new album more <b>Eco</b>!</p>
<p><b>∞</b></p>
<p>Next stage will bring together <b>portuguese musicians</b> that inspire me and add expression to my compositions.</p>
<p><b>∞</b></p>
<p>As in the previous album, <i><b>Coração emRaiz</b></i> will also count on a booklet* containing lyrics and drawings inspired by the <b>traditional portuguese shapes</b>, brought to life by the magic of Marta Valente. </p>
<p>*This booklet will contain the names of those who support the project, if there is no expressed objection.</p>
<p>Estimated <b>date</b> to finish and send the Album: April 2016</p>
<p><b>VISION</b></p>
<p>To give my contribution to the world by sharing the sounds and poems which inhabit me. To give strength to the regenerative and positive music that is flowering.</p>
<p>To register this lusitanian inspiration that brings new sounds to portuguese music and strengthens the connection I feel with it.</p>
<p>To let the spirit of this land be known, just as I feel it, to all the people that cross paths with this work, both in Portugal and throughout the world.</p>

E trago-vos uma boa notícia!
Vive em mim uma grande vontade de fazer nascer o meu segundo álbum de músicas originais com tonalidades e cores portuguesas. Este surge como um registo da energia que emergiu da minha viagem à Selva Amazónica em Janeiro de 2015 e os meses que se seguiram em Portugal. 
Apelo a Todos os que sentirem fazer deste projecto um pouco seu. Ao apoiar esta campanha estarão a participar activamente na concretização deste novo álbum, e assim tornar, este meu sonho, uma realidade para todos.

PROJECTO

Ao dar continuidade à linha do primeiro álbum “SOLay” que, em Quechua - a língua ancestral da cordilheira dos Andes -, significa Semear, a semente cria raiz. Nutrida da intenção de conhecer o que está mais profundo e de chegar ao coração do mundo, o nome deste próximo álbum será Coraçāo emRaiz.
Dando voz ao espírito da terra que me viu nascer, e à cultura das minhas raízes, neste disco cantarei em Português e na língua que o meu próprio coração inventa.
∞
A primeira fase de captação sonora já está a decorrer no Sul de Portugal, no cimo da montanha da Serra da Breijeira, no Estúdio Nazca Music, onde se vive de energias renováveis, o que torna este disco mais Eco!
∞
A próxima fase, juntará músicos portugueses que me inspiram e que complementam as minhas composições. 
∞
Assim como o primeiro álbum, o Coraçāo emRaíz contará com um pequeno livro* das letras e desenhos da minha autoria, desta vez inspirados nas formas tradicionais portuguesas que ganharāo vida com a magia de Marta Valente. 
*Nos agradecimentos do livro, constará os nomes de todos aqueles que apoiarem o projecto, caso nāo haja objecçāo.

SOBRE MIM
Nasci no Porto, Portugal, e desde pequena, mesmo antes de falar, que debitava o meu próprio idioma com sons inventados. 
A música sempre cresceu em mim intuitivamente, acompanhando as minhas escolhas e aprendizagens. No início por imitação e depois criando uma dança própria, ela foi ganhando forma e tornou-se a minha grande companheira.
Fui bebendo de algumas fontes: estudei percussão árabe; canto carnático na Índia; aprendi cantos tradicionais de várias partes do mundo; fiz a Universidade de Música em canto Jazz e descobri a música de intervenção em Portugal. Paralelamente, cultivei livremente o experimentar de novos sons e possibilidades, novas texturas e… a minha voz.
Hoje, as melodias que me habitam, vivem de um profundo e consciente amor pela Natureza e pela existência que me traz criações que tocam o coração das pessoas. Adoro viajar e sentir o bonito de cada “canto” do mundo, deixando-me inspirar por essas culturas e suas expressões. 
Semeei pela primeira vez no mundo com o meu Álbum “SOLay”, financiado por uma campanha crowdfunding que contou com a contribuição de mais de 100 pessoas. Criado no Peru e lançado em Outubro de 2014, abriu caminho para continuar a partilhar o que de melhor tenho para dar.

<ENGLISH>

Hello Family and Friends!
I greet each one of you warmly and with a heart filled with new melodies to share and launch into the World.
I bring you good news!
Within me lives a great desire of bringing to life my second album of original songs with portuguese colors and shades. It arises as a record of my trip to the Amazon Jungle and the following months in Portugal.
Here is a call to all of you who feel like taking a part on this project. By supporting this campaign you will be actively participating in the realization of this new album, therefore turning my dream into a common reality.
∞
PROJECT
Following the same line of the first album ""SOlay"", that in Quechua- the ancestral language of the Andes - means “to sow”, now the seed grows into a root (in Portuguese root means raiz). Nurtured with this intention of digging deeper to reach the core, the heart (coração) of the world, the name of this next album comes to be “Coração emRaiz”.
Giving voice to the spirit of the land that gave me birth, and the culture of my roots, this album shall be sung in Portuguese, along with the language that my own heart creates.
∞
The first stage of sound recording is already taking place in the south of Portugal, on top of Serra da Breijeira, in the Nazca Music Studio. This studio lives on sustainable energies, making this new album more Eco!
∞
Next stage will bring together portuguese musicians that inspire me and add expression to my compositions.
∞
As in the previous album, Coração emRaiz will also count on a booklet* containing lyrics and drawings inspired by the traditional portuguese shapes, brought to life by the magic of Marta Valente. 
*This booklet will contain the names of those who support the project, if there is no expressed objection.
Estimated date to finish and send the Album: April 2016
VISION
To give my contribution to the world by sharing the sounds and poems which inhabit me. To give strength to the regenerative and positive music that is flowering.
To register this lusitanian inspiration that brings new sounds to portuguese music and strengthens the connection I feel with it.
To let the spirit of this land be known, just as I feel it, to all the people that cross paths with this work, both in Portugal and throughout the world.
∞
BUDGET

<h3>The 2nd Album Cometh...</h3>
<p>We did Bonfire Music back in 2013. I promised another album would follow swiftly, and here we are, <strong>8 years later!</strong></p>
<p>Thing is, friends, <strong>I didn't have much to say</strong>. You can't write songs about meaningless shit ad infinitum, ad nauseum. (#justinbiebercan).</p>
<p>But over the past few years, that's changed. I suddenly find I have <strong>12 songs ready to go.</strong></p>
<p>They are songs about being a parent, and being a child; about the universe and creation and God's holy plan; about being rescued from hell by a redeeming presence.</p>
<p>They are <strong>good songs</strong>, friends, I assure you. When put together in the right order they<strong> sound nice</strong>.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>It's more than physical what I need</h3>
<p>That's not true, friends - it isn't. <strong>Something physical is exactly what I need.</strong> I need some cash. <strong>Your cash</strong>, actually.</p>
<p>I've been round my mate Jake's house to get a bunch of these songs recorded. Truth be told, they're pretty much <strong>all done already</strong>. That's why I can say they are good songs, and sound nice when put in the right order.</p>
<p>But now we need to <strong>mix and master</strong> them properly.</p>
<p>We started recording back in September 2019, if you can believe that. I would like to get the thing finished pronto, prontissimo, prontaprint. </p>
<p><strong>That's where you come in, compadre.</strong> I've spent around £1000 so far. Now I'd like to raise <strong>another £1000</strong>. That'll go to old Jakey for the mixing and mastering, and to Mike Wilton for a touch more instrument playing. </p>
<p>I must warn you, friends, I will probably use some of the money to buy myself some KFC too. Nothing can stop that.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What's in it for me?</h3>
<p>And by ""me"" I mean ""you"".</p>
<p>Well, <strong>signed CD's</strong>, <strong>lyric sheets</strong>, and <strong>house gigs</strong>. Those first two kinda suck, and no-one wants a stranger to come round their house and play songs.</p>
<p>But that's what I'm offering, friends. <strong>It's an offer you can't refuse.</strong></p>
<p>The signed CD's will look <strong>nice</strong>. The lyric sheets will look <strong>nice</strong>. The house gigs will make you <strong>feel nice.</strong></p>
<p>I can't promise you that I won't put the album on Spotify. <strong>I will. </strong>So you'll be able to listen to it, practically for free. I'll do that regardless. If no one buys any crappy CDs or lyric sheets, <strong>I'll pay for the thing myself. </strong></p>
<p>What I'm offering you here is a chance to <strong>feel like</strong> you're <strong>close to a star. </strong>The CD's will <strong>actually</strong> be signed by me. The lyric sheets will <strong>actually</strong> be made by me -<strong> my very own fingers, friends! </strong>Just think about that.</p>
<p>I can't promise it will be me who <strong>actually turns up to house gigs</strong>. I will most likely have a stunt double for those.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are none, friends. <strong>None!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Trust &amp; Transparency</h3>
<p>Full trust. Full transparency. <strong>That's what I offer.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>You already give to charity, you say? Signed up to something just the other week eh?</p>
<p><strong>Well, we've got a problem then, don't we. </strong></p>
<p>There's no other way you can help. </p>
<p>I thought we were friends?</p>

<p>Hi, I’m a jazz doublebassist and composer and my name’s Eva Kess. Born in Berlin, I grew up in Porto Alegre and Bern. My passion is music and it became my profession.</p>
<p>At the music academy of the city of Basel I recieved quiet a lot of musical input as well as in the Bird’s Eye Jazz Club which I frequented regularly during my time in Basel.</p>
<p>I’m feeling very happy and grateful for being able to present my new album „Flying Curly“ which we could record in Co-Production with the Swiss Culture Radio SRF. Only 4 bands a year get the opportunity to record for SRF and I'm truly thankful for that opportunity! The CD is going to be released on February 24th 2017 on the label UNIT Records.</p>
<p>Our soundengineer was Andy Neresheimer and Peter Bürli from SRF made it possible that the production took place (both based in Zürich).</p>
<p>The pictures on the CD were shot by Berlin based photographer George Ambrose Baake and the cover was designed by Bern based graphic artist Benjamin Scheurer.</p>
<p>All the music on the album was written by me, brought to life by my beautiful, lively and wonderful co-musicians.</p>
<p>The Eva Kess Group is a quiet international band. Our guitarist Filipe Duarte is from Lisbon, Portugal. I met him in Manhattan and he recently moved to Berlin, Germany. Gregor Ftičar is an excellent pianist from Slovenia, was a student in Graz, Austria, and we met at the Generations Jazzfestival in Frauenfeld, Switzerland. Our drummer Peter Kronreif is Austrian and lives in Brooklyn.</p>
<p>Would you like to listen how we sound? Then feel free to click on the following link. That’s my homepage and on the start page you'll find the teaser that I produced together with my Zürich based friend and videowoman Palma Fiacco on a icecold day beginning of January 2017 above the rooftops in the old town of Bern, Switzerland.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Bob Conover. Im 29, a father, husband, and I work a fulltime job. I'm the co-owner and founder of Savage Custom Picks. I started playing guitar when I was 14, and I have been in love with music all my life. Throughout my years of playing guitar I have tried MANY different kinds of picks and there were always things I liked or didn't like about certain picks. I found ones I liked but they were never perfect. After discovering boutique picks it occurred to me that I could learn how to make my own. So for months I worked at making picks out of acrylic. After alot of hard work I finally developed my own style of making picks and discovered that people were interested in purchasing the picks I was making. After many, many sales and new friendships, Savage Custom Picks has become what it is. We are rapidly gaining a fanbase and its the most incredible feeling to create something that people love.</p>
<p>Even though I am able to make any kind of pick, I am not able to do certain things. Mostly, people want certain customization and huge amounts of picks. This campaign is geared towards raising funds in order to purchase certain equipment in order to fulfill requests that we are currently not able to fulfill.</p>
<p>Savage Custom Picks is my baby. Even though I work a full time job during the day, at night, I am in my shop creating super awesome guitar picks. Because of the jump in production this new equipment would provide, my partner Daryl Altizer and I, will be one step closer to making Savage our fulltime job. It is our dream to do nothing but provide the best boutique picks on the market and wake up everyday knowing that we will be doing what we love and making people happy.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are attempting to raise $5000. This money will be used specifically for the following reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lazer Etcher- This is by far the most important purchase that will be made. This will be used for custom engraving on acrylic picks and band logos on normal picks that will never fade unlike regular printing that is applied to most picks.</li>
<li>Shop Equipment- We will be purchasing various shop tools such as a planer, new sanders and saws, and other various hand tools we use on a daily basis.</li>
<li>Unique Materials- There are many different materials we want to make picks from. Some of them being a little higher end. These funds will allow us to purchase these materials, allowing us to make unique picks that no-one else is offering.</li>
<li>Merchandise- Lastly, these funds will allow us to offer more options in our merch store. There will be unique items such as lazer cut, led lit savage signs. Another example would be custom necklaces and keychains which we constantly get requests for.sss</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some of you may not be able to contribute financially and that is totally understandable. One way you can still help is to just share this campaign everywhere you can. We are trying to change the way people think about picks and you sharing this campaign is incredibly valuable. </p>

<p><strong>Mortal Lessons</strong> is an hour-long work of music theater based on a book of the same name by Richard Selzer. A former Yale surgeon, Selzer's writing combines his intimate knowledge of the human body with a love for baroque language and flights of fancy that are by turns grotesque and sublime. My piece toes a similar line between the sacred and profane, the grotesque and sublime—life, death, love and all the rest.<br/><br/><strong>The work will receive its full-length premiere on February 25, 2018</strong>, at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music as the headlining work on the Hot Air Music Festival. <br/><br/><strong>Your tax-deductible contribution will help make this work come to life</strong>. This production is truly a team effort, and, by contributing any amount, YOU are becoming part of our team as well. <br/><br/><strong>I can't do this work without them and WE can't do it without YOU. </strong></p>

<p><strong><u>Our Story:</u></strong></p>
<p>The Unfortunates are a high energy rock band from Edmonton, Alberta. Founded by vocalist/guitarist Tanner Gordon and bassist Tim Plamondon, the duo instantly formed a tight musical chemistry that evolved beyond folk roots. Drummer Brendan McGonigle was added to create the original inception of the band.<br/><br/>In 2010 the band released their first collective effort ""Calm down this is only the end"". The album featured the singles ""Losing you"" and ""Calm down"", and was well received by the public. 19 months later, the band released their acclaimed record ""We talked of shadows"", and received ""Band of the month"" honours from local radio station Sonic 102.9. This album produced the hit song ""Hurt no more"", which was given regular radio play for the following year, as well as thousands of views on YouTube. </p>
<p>2014 brought a new album, Indie Films, a new member, guitarist Nathan Stamhuis, and a name change to the group, who would henceforth be known solely as ""The Unfortunates"".  Indie films was received as a worthy follow up to the previous 2011 album, producing the single ""Talk show host"" and the hit ""Brick by brick"". The band also embarked on an ambitious cross Canada tour, performing 12 shows in 14 days across 9 urban centres. </p>
<p>The band immediately began writing for another album, while in the meantime adding another guitarist in Leo Contessa. Shortly after this addition the band played it's 200th show and continued to develop into one of the premier live bands in Alberta.The bands latest self titled release is scheduled for June 22, 2018. </p>
