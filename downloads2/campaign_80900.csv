<strong> </strong><h3>Gypsy Road Fundraiser</h3>
<p>My Name is Garry Anthony, I am a Singer Songwriter/Truck Driver from Montreal, Quebec, I recently bought my copyright and master tapes for an album I recorded with 2M records and Mega Producer Bill Szawlowski called Gypsy Road, but I had to go to court to be heard in front of a judge first, my court case was picked up by TV Court Show L'Arbitre, they played the title song Gypsy Road and I won my case in front of thousands of Quebecers, in the following days after the show aired I got a thousand views of my YouTube video for Gypsy Road and hundreds of friend requests on Facebook all congratulating me  telling me how much they like the record, and asking where they could by the album... the problem is I haven't had records to sell for a long time, and after buying my copyright back plus Lawyer fees I am short of money to pay for a duplication of 500 CDs, that is what brought me to try a Fund Raising Campaign to get the $2000 we need to get 500 CDs made.</p>
<p>I truly believe in Gypsy Road, it is very well recorded album, and is still relevant in todays country music market, we will give the CD a fresh new look and hopefully re-release it in the spring of 2015. By booking shows, selling records, and using the new social media that was not available when we first launched it, Gypsy Road will get the chance it deserves.</p>
<p>We would like to offer a few perks to the people who would donate to our campaign, for people that donate $100 we will give 2 copies of the CD, and for people that donate $500 we will play a live private show at their home, and for people that wish us well but can't donate, all we ask is for some help getting the word out about our campaign, we would really appreciate anything you can do. </p>

We made two records, ""soul rash"" in 1993 and ""language of fools"", in 1995.  We toured the country and played many festivals through the 90’s until we could no longer survive, financially, on the road or in the studio. With no record lable and no tour support, we were left discouraged and with nowhere left to go. </p>

Pía Páez.
Pía Páez, es una cantante y compositora venezolana nacida en la ciudad de Mérida-Venezuela. que desde muy pequeña ha tenido un largo recorrido por la música. Ha participado en la movida nacional venezolana y brasilera; ha destacado en proyectos de la talla de Pinkfonik y ha colaborado con importantes bandas y músicos venezolanos entre los que destacan temas como ""Zamuro"" de Charliepapa en su documental ""Las Últimas Leguas"", ""Hoy es un Buen Día"" y ""Todo lo que me Das"" de Caseroloops, ""En Boca"" de Sr. Méndez, ""Boy"" ft. Sunsplash y su más reciente colaboración con el rapero Budú y sus tema ""Hoy es Hoy"" y ""Revolution"". En el año 2014 Pía fue nominada como ""Artista Revelación"" a los Premios Pepsi Music de Venezuela. Actualmente trabaja en su primera producción discográfica como solista titulada ""Tú y tu lado oscuro"" cargada de un estilo musical el cual define como ""Piano Pop & Rythm"" producida por Sr.Mendez (Aureliano Mendez).EnglishProudly being Venezuelan, I sadly have to say that the situation my country is going through has only been an obstacle for my album and a delay for the process. Because of the currency control our money worths nothing (while i'm writing this lines $1 dollar equals 10 times the highest denomination bill of my country).
I spent the last 5 years of my life collecting pieces of me with a paper, a pencil and my piano. Making songs from my experiences. And I've been through an emotional roller coaster that resulted in my debut album as a solo artist entitled ""Tú y tu lado Oscuro (You and your dark side)"".

Many of you have stay with me since the beginning, all along the way. keeping your eyes on me, inspiring me and believing in me regardless of my own doubts. Together in the sunny days and together in the moonless nights.
Today I thank you all for being there, because of that, I feel immensely rich. Yet, to be able to share my music with the world, to inspire and make a difference, I need a serious financial support.
Somehow, you are my record label. Each of you can share this project and my dream. Simply pre-ordering my album ""You and your dark side.""
MILESTONES
1. $4500 The Album gets mastered and distributed (Includes: mastering, art, project manufacture and distribution).
2. $9000 Showcase. PR and basic promotion.
3. $21000 Lets TOUR! My album is READY! (you can listen a little preview on the campaign video). Each song is recorded because of the help I got from incredible talented people who participated on it. And an excellent producer (Aureliano Méndez), who believed in me and made a piece of art off of all the elements. 

Without a record label, going through the ""making a record"" process is not easy work, nor cheap. but I made it to this point. 
The collected money will cover the costs of:

Mastering, Art, Manufacturing and Distributing the project.
Basic PR and marketing.
Indiegogo's fee.
Perks.
Album Showcase.
Tour – the best thing about making a record is playing it LIVE!


Share this campaign with your friends (Via FB, email or through the old ""mouth to mouth"" way). That is a big help. 
Please check the information below. and if you want to pre-order the album check on the right side for the amount you wish to choose and the corresponding list of perks.
I love you and I thank you more than words.Pía.
The Musicians. 
This are the talented musicians that help me make this possible. 

Aureliano Mendez. Producer.
Better known to his fans as Panasuyo and Sr. Mendez, he is a Venezuelan musician And His trademark sound is a fusion of traditional Venezuelan musical forms  and Caribbean rhythms with rock , pop and reggae. With 2 albums and a LatinGrammy award, he has produced bands as Calle 13, Palenke Soultribe, Sonido Guay Ñeñe, to name a few. 
Another musicians in the album are:

Hector Martinez. 
Andres Carabaño. 
Kitchu Dub.
Lorenzo Ávila. 
Sebastian ""C-Bass"" Velazquez.

<h1>Namaste!</h1>
<p>We are Bolo!, a kirtan band based in Southern California. We play ecstatic live kirtan that honors the authentic roots of traditional Indian devotional singing.</p>
<p><b>Gurudās</b> — Lead singer and harmonium<br/>
<b>Tripurāsundarī</b> — Background vocals and <i>manjira</i> (hand symbols)<br/>
<b>Michael</b> — Djembe<br/>
<b>Amy</b> — <i>Khartal</i> (Indian tambourine)<br/>

<h2>What is Kirtan?</h2>
<p>Kirtan is the practice of devotional chanting that originated in India. The Sanskrit word <i>kīrtana</i> means “celebration” or “praise”. It’s sometimes called <i>sankīrtana</i>, which is devotional chanting done together as a group. It is also known as <i>harināma</i>, or the “names of God”. It is said that God is fully present in his/her names, so when we chant the names with devotion we are in the presence of the divine.</p><p>Kirtan is a tool designed to keep our wandering minds focused on the divine. Swami Bhajanananda, head priest of the <a href=""http://kalimandir.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kali Mandir</a> in Laguna Beach, CA, says of kirtan, “If you sow a thought you reap a deed, because thought precedes action. If you sow a deed you reap a habit, because deeds repeated become habit. If you sow a habit you reap a character, because the sum total of our habits is our character.” So the more we can focus our thoughts on God, the more saintly we will inevitably become. “A saint thinks only of God — there is no second thought.”</p>
<h2>What We’re Making</h2>
<p>With your help, we are recording and producing three new albums of kirtan music. Kirtan is the easiest and most powerful method we have to keep our consciousness fixed on God and develop <i>bhakti</i>, or devotion. It is our sincere hope and desire that we can share our love and passion for kirtan with as many people as possible.</p>
<h3>Why Three albums?</h3>
<p>It’s been eight years since we released our first album, called <a href=""http://www.bolochant.com/music/bhakti-yuga"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b><i>Bhakti Yuga</i></b></a>. We’ve talked many times since then about recording another album, and we tried several times to get it off the ground, but it never came together. Real life, as they say, kept getting in the way.</p>
<p>Kirtan is part of our spiritual practice, not our profession, so we all have full-time jobs that haven’t always allowed us the time or the means we would need to dedicate to a recording project. But now, thanks to crowd-funding platforms like Indiegogo, and generous support from amazing people like you, we feel that the time is right, and rather than just record one album and risk letting eight more years go by, we decided we should go all in!</p>
<h3><i>Śakti</i></h3>
<p>This album will be a celebration of the divine mother. <i>Śakti</i> means “power” or “energy” in Sanskrit. It is the underlying force within creation and is personified as the divine feminine. The supreme goddess is called Ādi Parāśakti, the “first and ultimate power”. These songs will celebrate and honor this feminine energy and try to awaken it within ourselves as <i>kuṇḍalinī</i>.</p>
<h3><i>Hare Kṛṣṇa</i></h3>
<p>This album is a meditation on the <i>hare kṛṣṇa</i> mantra, which is called the <i>mahāmantra</i> or the “great mantra”. Every track will feature this powerful mantra.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">हरे कृष्ण हरे कृष्ण कृष्ण कृष्ण हरे हरे<br/>
हरे राम हरे राम राम राम हरे हरे</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>hare kṛṣṇa hare kṛṣṇa<br/>
kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa hare hare<br/>
hare rāma hare rāma<br/>
rāma rāma hare hare</b></p>
<h3><i>Rādhe Śyāma</i></h3>
<p>Rādhā is celebrated as the greatest devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa, and is herself worshipped as a divine incarnation. When we sing to Rādhā, we are trying to awaken within ourselves the same all-consuming love for Kṛṣṇa that she embodies.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Why We Need Your Support</h2>
<p>Producing an album is expensive. Studio time, mixing, and mastering the final mix are all very costly. It’s not uncommon for an indie band to spend $30k–$50k or more on a single album. We can reduce some of that cost by doing most of the recording in our tiny home studio, along with the preliminary mixing, but we still have to hire professionals to do the final mixing, and especially the mastering.</p>
<p>We are also going to be bringing in some immensely talented, world-class musicians. Some of them are dear friends of ours, and would probably play for free, but out of respect, and to keep the project in integrity, we want to pay them well for their time and talent.</p>
<p>Another cost is licensing fees. Not all of the songs we are recording are original compositions, and we have to pay licensing fees for the songs we are covering.</p>
<p>There are also lots of little costs that come with a project like this: producing our campaign video, graphic design for the CD booklets, updating our website, as well as the other perks offered in this campaign (t-shirts, stickers, etc.). There’s also Indiegogo’s percentage, and a big chunk for Uncle Sam.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>What You Get</h2>
<p>We’ve got some great perks for you, including digital downloads of the albums, limited-edition physical CDs, t-shirts, and more.</p>
<h3>The Albums</h3>
<p>Obviously, the reason for the season is the music itself. We have several ways for you to get the music. You can get digital downloads of either one album of your choice, or all three of the albums, with the option to also get an e-book version of the CD booklet with the lyrics and meanings of all the songs.</p>
<p>You can also get a limited-edition physical CD of either one album of your choice or all three albums. The CDs will come with beautiful full-color booklets with the lyrics and meanings of all the songs. We say these are limited-edition because this will be your only opportunity to get physical CDs of these albums. After this campaign, the albums will be available by digital download only, so if you prefer to have a physical CD for your collection, this is your only chance.</p>
<h3>T-Shirts</h3>
<p>You can also get some beautiful t-shirts. We have three designs you can choose from: Ganesha, Shiva, or Hanuman (or you can get all three!).</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1470616511/Shirts_mo3ytn.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>Japa Mālā</h3>
<p>I will make a custom, one of a kind japa mālā, and then bless it during a special pūjā ceremony. A japa mālā is a string of prayer beads, often made with rudrākṣa beads, sandalwood beads, or tulasī beads (holy basil). Japa mālās are used to count during the practice of mantra repetition, which is called <i>japa</i>.</p><p>The malas we are offering are crafted and consecrated according to the <i>Akshamalika Upanishad</i>. As per the Upanishad, the malas are crafted with ten kinds of beads: coral, pearl, crystal, conch, sandalwood, putranjiva seeds, lotus seeds, rudraksha seeds, gold, and silver. The malas will be blessed during a powerful pūjā ceremony that will invoke all the letters of the Sanskrit alphabet, establishing each letter to reside within the beads, thus tuning the mala for much more effective, powerful recitation of Sanskrit mantras.</p>
<h3>14k Gold Om Necklace</h3>
<p>This beautiful Oval Om Necklace is designed by our own Tripurāsundarī for her jewelry line <a href=""http://taylorkenney.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Taylor Kenney Jewelry</a>. It will be cast in solid 14 karat gold (either rose or yellow gold), and set with a 2mm conflict-free rose cut diamond.</p>

<h3>Be on the Album</h3>
<p>This perk is available only for US residents. I will travel to you and record you singing background vocals. If you’re not a strong singer, don’t worry. We can record you reciting a mantra, chanting Om, playing some percussion, or even just clapping your hands. We’ll make it work!</p>
<h3>Pūjā</h3>
<p>This perk is available only for US residents. I will travel to you and perform an authentic pūjā ceremony, which will include using Sanskrit mantras to create a sacred space, invite the deities to accept our worship, and perform the worship using various offerings such as incense and flowers. I will also teach you the basics so you can perform a simple pūjā yourself.</p>
<h3>Private Concert</h3>
<p>This perk is available only to US residents. We will all travel to you and perform a private kirtan concert, either in your home or in a local yoga studio. It could be just for you, for your friends, or open to the public. It’s entirely up to you!</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Giving Back</h2>
<p>For us, kirtan is a spiritual practice, not a money-making endeavor. For that reason, we are committed to donating any funds generated from this campaign over and above what is needed to make the albums and fulfill the various perks to the <a href=""http://shantipurifriends.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Shantipuri Friends Foundation</a>, founded and run by our very dear friend <a href=""http://nirvanananda.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Swami Nirvanananda</a>. This foundation helps provide food, housing, medical care, schooling, and vocational training to hundreds of disadvantaged children in India. Swami Nirvanananda works primarily in the area around the holy city of Puri on the east coast of India, but has recently begun helping the children of Tibetan refugees in the Ladakh region of western India.</p>

<h3>Who is Anji?</h3>
<p>Hey, so I'm Angela Hutchins (singer/songwriter extraordinaire) and Anji is my stage name (pronounced awhh-neee). I started this project in 2017, hoping to inspire and motivate young creatives to pursue their passions &amp; follow their dreams. My music is my outlet for healing, processing and connecting more deeply with the world around me, and the songs that I have created for this particular EP are my most powerful and professionally produced ones yet. I can't wait to share with you my journey from Darkness into Light.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564073086/ufxeeobhxol12rwmbtcc.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>What it is:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li> This IndieGoGo campaign will give me the opportunity to better gauge my audience, release professional music, and access the tools needed to set up a killer EPK to take my music and performances to the next level.</li>
<li>Until now, I've been paying everything out of pocket to create and share my music, content and creations for free, but making this EP has already cost over $3,000...</li>
<li>With YOUR input, even if you can't contribute, I can turn my music into a fully-functioning platform, and put on some killer performances that will help me connect with others &amp; inspire them to achieve their dreams.</li>
<li>
<strong>The message of this EP is LIGHT - love, connection, community, joy, unity, and strength. This campaign is an opportunity for me to better appreciate and reward the community that has gotten me to where I am today</strong>, <strong>that brought me into the Light</strong>. Thank you all!!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Why I Need YOU:</h3>
<p>Pre-ordering the EPs tells me how many I need to order! It's easier to supply the right amount (and the right kind) of merch if I know what everyone is interested in. And the money made from these extra perks, exclusive rewards and pre-orders will also go toward:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paying my team -  which means my producer ($600), engineer ($1250), backing band ($300), and sound guy at the show ($150). Ordering merch ($500), and ordering CDs ($488) are also a massive expense. In addition to that, there's also copyrights ($55), graphic design ($75), publishing ($50), distribution ($48), and more... <strong>In total, that's over $4k.</strong>
</li>
<li>HOWEVER - now I have an excellent excuse to create some awesome perks for my Majik Makers! AKA - people like you who make the majik happen!</li>
<li>If we reach our goal of $3,000 - awesome! If we don't, I'll still put the money toward merch, perks and CDs (because you guys deserve it) and pay the rest off myself. But I greatly appreciate every single dollar and every single share or contribution, because it helps me establish my tribe, bring my message to more people, and build a tighter community.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1563475014/eahabbgg0vd2gzkipjzn.png"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As a performer, I've visited schools, given talks, music lessons, and run music camps and mentored multiple young songwriters and musicians. Every time I go somewhere new, I meet another student who is unsure about pursuing their passion - they know what they want, but are afraid, or lack the resources, or have questions about how to break into the industry. Seeing a young adult take the stage, give talks about performing and recording, and live a life of creative expression is usually all the evidence that they need to take the next step, and getting my information means that they automatically have one more person on their team. With this EP, I will be able to reach a larger audience, play more shows &amp; festivals, and inspire more young musicians. And YOU are such a huge part of that.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1563475058/mcikmvt1rladtnq3m96z.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>So, why IndieGoGo?</strong> I've had a successful Kickstarter campaign before, but those are ""all or nothing"" campaigns, which means that unless I reach the goal, we lose all the money and nobody gets any perks. I've chosen IndieGoGo because I don't want to pressure my people to give more than they feel comfortable, and also to make sure that you get your perks no matter what.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Being in this industry is risky business - things happen that you had no way to plan for, and there are people who will take your money but give poor results, or completely waste your time waiting for them to follow through. I've already lost $600 and four months toward tracking instruments for this project that I couldn't use later, because the files corrupted, or waiting for mixes that took way too long to get back to me. Things like this DO happen. It's all a part of the learning experience. There is a possibility that this campaign may not be 100% successful, but even so I will hold up my end of the bargain NO MATTER WHAT. Even if we don't reach the goal, I will do whatever it takes to get my music to you guys. Having your support will just make the process a lot easier, and a lot less expensive for me, because I'll be able to hire professionals who can do a great job at whatever task they're given in an efficient amount of time.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>A lot of us are low on funds, so if you can't join the campaign, but you would still like to help support the release of the Light EP, then please share with someone you think might be interested! Other things you can do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the word out by sharing on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram or Youtube!</li>
<li>Post a photo on instagram, jamming to the new single &amp; tag @majikanji!</li>
</ul>
</div><p>Thank you all for your support! Love you and all you do to make the world a more musical place &lt;3</p><p>ALSO - you're invited to the EP Release to celebrate the campaign, see you there!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1563475127/bt38qfmouzgmzgquiyf8.png"" src=""""/></p></div>","Who is Anji?

Pre-ordering the EPs tells me how many I need to order! It's easier to supply the right amount (and the right kind) of merch if I know what everyone is interested in. And the money made from these extra perks, exclusive rewards and pre-orders will also go toward:

Paying my team -  which means my producer ($600), engineer ($1250), backing band ($300), and sound guy at the show ($150). Ordering merch ($500), and ordering CDs ($488) are also a massive expense. In addition to that, there's also copyrights ($55), graphic design ($75), publishing ($50), distribution ($48), and more... In total, that's over $4k.

HOWEVER - now I have an excellent excuse to create some awesome perks for my Majik Makers! AKA - people like you who make the majik happen!
If we reach our goal of $3,000 - awesome! If we don't, I'll still put the money toward merch, perks and CDs (because you guys deserve it) and pay the rest off myself. But I greatly appreciate every single dollar and every single share or contribution, because it helps me establish my tribe, bring my message to more people, and build a tighter community.



The Impact
As a performer, I've visited schools, given talks, music lessons, and run music camps and mentored multiple young songwriters and musicians. Every time I go somewhere new, I meet another student who is unsure about pursuing their passion - they know what they want, but are afraid, or lack the resources, or have questions about how to break into the industry. Seeing a young adult take the stage, give talks about performing and recording, and live a life of creative expression is usually all the evidence that they need to take the next step, and getting my information means that they automatically have one more person on their team. With this EP, I will be able to reach a larger audience, play more shows & festivals, and inspire more young musicians. And YOU are such a huge part of that.

So, why IndieGoGo? I've had a successful Kickstarter campaign before, but those are ""all or nothing"" campaigns, which means that unless I reach the goal, we lose all the money and nobody gets any perks. I've chosen IndieGoGo because I don't want to pressure my people to give more than they feel comfortable, and also to make sure that you get your perks no matter what.

Risks & Challenges
Being in this industry is risky business - things happen that you had no way to plan for, and there are people who will take your money but give poor results, or completely waste your time waiting for them to follow through. I've already lost $600 and four months toward tracking instruments for this project that I couldn't use later, because the files corrupted, or waiting for mixes that took way too long to get back to me. Things like this DO happen. It's all a part of the learning experience. There is a possibility that this campaign may not be 100% successful, but even so I will hold up my end of the bargain NO MATTER WHAT. Even if we don't reach the goal, I will do whatever it takes to get my music to you guys. Having your support will just make the process a lot easier, and a lot less expensive for me, because I'll be able to hire professionals who can do a great job at whatever task they're given in an efficient amount of time.

Other Ways You Can Help
A lot of us are low on funds, so if you can't join the campaign, but you would still like to help support the release of the Light EP, then please share with someone you think might be interested! Other things you can do:

<h3>Who we are?<br/> </h3>
<p>We are Nasty Ratz. Sleaze band from Prague, Czech Republic. For last couple of years, we've travelled all around Europe as headliners, co-headliners or as a support act of our idols. The place where we live isn't very friendly when talking about new bands. That's why we have chosen this way.</p>
<p>You won't only help us to record new album and possibly the new video. You have also a chance to purchase merchandise that has never been offered before! And many of it won't be offered in the future. Everything from our usual store is discounted and signed.</p>
<div> </div>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Do you like old school rock music without using fake instruments and you are tired of listening to the garage bands with no will and no aims? We're here to rock your world. Very year, we are one step further. We toured Europe and we work hard every day.<br/><br/>You won't get only new music from us. There's a chance to get cool merchandise such as swimsuit, condoms, t-shirts etc. We care about our fans because we know there wouldn't be a single year in Nasty Ratz history.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why NASTY RATZ?</h3>
<p>We know that there are so many bands out there. Nasty Ratz are one of the bands that can make old-like music for new generation of rockers! Do you remember titans like Guns N'Roses, KISS, Mötley Crüe and many more? Let's help us to be few steps closer to them and make the rock music survive!<br/><br/> </p>
<div> </div>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As the band that exists for years, we cannot afford any unpleased fan. There is no way you would lost your money for nothing. Every purchased item will be sent as soon as possible. Latest term is the end of December when the album is released!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you cannot afford any of the perks, we'd love to hear from you anyway. Help us to spread the world and feel free to share your opinion with us and also with public!</p>

</ul>
<p>We are asking any and everyone to make a minimum pledge of $5 to help support the percussion performing arts in El Paso, Texas and to be the premiere ensemble of the South-West United States. </p>

<h3>Who are we?</h3>
<p><br/>My name is Eman Chalshotori and I am a professional cellist based in Kansas City, MO. My collaborator, Melody Stroth is an established professional pianist, organist and piano teacher in Overland Park, KS. Melody and I began collaborating 6 years ago at Prairie Baptist Church and we have gone on to perform throughout the midwest ever since. Notable performances include opening the Ruel Joyce Recital Series in 2017 and 2019, the Kansas City Music Club, and tackling the tango and pop standard repertoire with the wild and effervescent band, Vivant!</p>
<p>As musicians navigating our way through the recent pandemic, we wondered how we could bring some music and inspiration to our community and the world at large. We have played a lot of music together and our greatest accolades have come from our sacred and Christmas repertoire. So we thought what better way to service our community-at-large than by recording and releasing some of our most beloved and requested encores in this our very first holiday album.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why are we doing this?</h3>
<p>Growing up in in the Midwest, the Fall and Winter were:<br/>filled with family, good food, classic films, warm homes, brisk winter winds whistling through the prairie, decking the halls, sharing moments with the people you love and who bring joy to your life. We wanted to pull together a soundtrack of these emotions, feelings, and memories…to narrate through music, the feelings associated with the festive season .</p>
<p>This is where the inception of the CD and its title came to fruition. We hope this music will serve as an reflective interlude from the hustle of everyday life. Irregardless of how you celebrate the holidays, everyone needs a moment of respite from the toils of everyday life...a Winter-lude.</p>
<p>Whether its the cirrus-laced winter horizons, the familiar sounds of traditional Christmas music, or just sitting in your home relaxing after a hard days work, We hope this album will bring some joy and repose into your home this Winter.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Funding Needs </h3>
<p>Everything comes at a price and, unfortunately for us, this is an endeavor that costs more than we are able to fully fund on our own. We hope you will help us bring this little project into fruition and allow us to share this wonderful music with you all this holiday season</p>
<p><u>Recording Costs: $2,200</u></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Studio Time: $950<br/>Editing &amp; Mixing: $650​<br/>Mastering: $625​</p>
<p><u>Mechanical and Digital Distribution Licenses: $500</u></p>
<p><u>CD Production and Printing: $700  </u></p>
<p><u>Artwork and Post Production: $1,600</u></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Album Content </h3>
<p>We will feature works and arrangements by incredible composers Morten Lauridsen, Mark Hayes, Victor Labenske, Ola Gjeilo, Tracy Icenogle, including our favorite selections from musical sensations “The Piano Guys"" and “Brooklyn Duo”. Many of these works will be the first recordings of these arrangements.</p>
<p>O Come O Come Emmanuel - The Piano Guys</p>

<p>*Coventry Carol - Mark Hayes</p>
<p>*In the Bleak Midwinter - Tracy Icenogle</p>

Whether its the cirrus-laced winter horizons, the familiar sounds of traditional Christmas music, or just sitting in your home relaxing after a hard days work, We hope this album will bring some joy and repose into your home this Winter.

<h2>Just Najima</h2>
<p>I've been singing music my entire life... but usually it was in the background. I'd sing back-up in other people's projects or follow their lead. I figured that was where I fit. I loved music, I had a nice voice... I kicked ass at karaoke, but I wasn't an artist... I didn't have ideas.</p>
<p>Then my last musical project broke-up. </p>
<p>During that period of time, I was already feeling a lot of heartbreak. It felt like all around me the world was in turmoil and pressure... defeat. The loss of my musical partnership was just another tough break in a world that kept on grinding even as its fabric disintegrated. </p>
<p>That's when I turned to soul music. <i>Living just enough for the city</i> with Stevie Wonder. Lamenting, <i>the way they do my life</i> with Marvin Gaye. In that moment, I started hearing my own music. <i>Oh wicked people, in a wicked world...</i></p>
<p>I started recording bits of music, ideas for a soul album.  I had no clue how I'd make it happen with no money and no band and no prospects for either. I just kept writing and creating. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><b>QUEENIE</b></h2>
<p>It's been a year since I first began writing the album in that time I began working with Jillian Bessett at the Jiantt Recording Studio here in Tucson. Between the two of us, our four kids, two dogs, and one very patient Paul, we recorded magic.</p>
<p>Once Jillian heard my ideas and understood my vision... we dug right in. Working late nights, afternoons, evenings and whenever we could squeeze time in. We looped and recorded and dismantled and reconstructed every single song with such care. I truly believe we created  the album I was dreaming of back in the day when I thought the idea of me being able to make this real was IMPOSSIBLE. </p>
<p>We have managed to accomplish so much with so little... but we've reached the limits of what we can do alone. Now I have to reach out and ask for help to finish what we've start. </p>
<p>This is the part where I say why this campaign matters, but its hard for me to say that I think this album matters when we are watching the world as we know it begin to unravel. It's hard to say music matters in the face of government instability and environmental catastrophes. It seems arrogant to say my album matters...</p>
<p>But I go back to Marvin Gaye asking, ""What's going on?"" or the Temptations singing about a <i>Ball of Confusion. </i>Then I think to myself, ""Has there ever been a time when soul music is needed more?""</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>The Big Ask</strong></h2>
<p>I'm not used to asking for big favors, and I'm really, really scared to do it. The truth is, to do what I'd like to do, not just with this album but with Just Najima... </p>
<p>I need $10,000.</p>
<p>That amount of money will allow me to pay for the album's final production costs.  It will also allow me as an artist to upgrade my equipment, and to plan a small tour. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi! I'm Zach Butler and I am a singer-songwriter from Macon, Georgia, currently based in Atlanta - and I need your help.</p>
<p>After gigging for over two years and writing 50+ songs I am running a campaign to raise money to make my first professional record at Capricorn Sound Studios in Macon, GA. </p>
<p>This is huge to me, I've always wanted my very own record, and if you contributed you'd be helping me start what is hopefully a long, successful career.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Here is the breakdown</p>
<ul>
<li>I need to raise $4,000 to record for 4 days (8 hours a day) at Capricorn Sound Studios in Macon, GA.</li>
<li>Each day in Studio A costs $1,000 for use of studio equipment and to hire a professional audio engineer</li>
<li>For contributing, you get unique perks like helping make decisions about the album, getting signed merch, access to unreleased tracks, and even private musical experiences</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This album has the potential to change my life. Having professionally recorded music opens up the door for booking gigs, starting my musical career, and most importantly making more music for fans like you to enjoy.</p>
<p>I am already setting this record in motion and I'm serious about getting it done, and I'll let you in on the whole process</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Of course, there are risks associated with something like this.</p>
<ul>
<li>Perhaps I don't like what we record and I run out of funding for the record before I get it perfect</li>
<li>I could have issues with getting the record out with minimal support and no label.</li>
</ul>
<p>But I've already accounted for these contingencies.</p>
<ul>
<li>My band and I will be more than just prepared when we enter the studio for maximum efficiency recording these songs</li>
<li>And I have lots of people around me willing to do the work to help make my dream come true. And I'll never be able to say thank you enough. You could be one of those people, I'll never forget what you did to help me get this started.</li>

We believe this album will help move our career forward. Since 2013, we had performed numerous shows, and we've used a lot of those shows to raise funds to help charitable organizations.* This album will provide us with a way to keep doing what we love, and at the same time have a tangible way of sharing this passion with our fans.*WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT TO US? Our long term goal/intention is to have a much bigger following and be “someone” in the industry so we can have more influence and raise more money when we do fundraisers for different charities. It’s such an incredible feeling to be able to do what you love and at the same time help others. In November 2016, we released a Christmas album, Our Savior’s Birth. We sold Our Savior’s Birth to benefit one of our church ministries. We raised $600 for The Sower Ministry Santa Clarita Valley. We are hoping to sell out the CDs so we can recover our costs.WHO IS KiKstart? (Do you hear Julie Andrews’ Getting to Know You playing in your head right now?) Some of the many articles written about KiKstart:
KiKstart raises funds for local Food Pantry through Thanks-KiK-ving Concert
KiKstart performs at the historic The Mint L.A.
KiKstart Rocks the World-Famous Whisky a Go Go
WHEN WILL THE ALBUM BE DONE? We already started recording, but with a lot more tracks to record, plus editing, mixing, mastering, etc. We are projecting that it will take us at least six months after the end of the campaign to complete the album (the soonest around October 2018).WHAT WILL BE IN THE ALBUM? There will be thirteen songs in the album including two cover songs, which are Electric Love by BØRNS, and Cut Right Through Me by Hanson. It will also include a revamp of our 2014 single, Heart Might Break Again. The album, which we’re calling “flashbaKK,” will include:
Here For You
Mr. Man
A Memory You Knew
Void
Heart Might Break Again
Picnics on the Driveway
Electric Love
Where I’m Going
Time Doesn’t Wait (working title)
Miss You Like Crazy
Never Be the Same
Cut Right Through Me
Don’t Let it Bring You Down


HOW IS THE MONEY GOING TO BE USED? A lot is involved in making an album, but we're only asking funding for the most basic necessities. See breakdown of why we need $11,700 below.

Studio time (recording, editing, mixing, mastering)                        $5000
CDs (replication, packaging, printing)                                                  $3500
Licensing for two cover songs                                                                    $500
CD Baby (CD & Digital distribution, barcode, download cards)      $150
Photography & make-up artist for CD art                                              $700
Fulfillment costs for the rewards                                                               $650
Indiegogo fees**                                                                                            $1200                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Total = $11,700** (If we make $10,000, the estimated Indiegogo fee is $810.

<h3>New Studio, New Album</h3>
<p>It rocked my world recently when I realized that I have been recording and performing music for almost seven years now. There have been a lot of changes over that time - a lot of things have gone well, and a few things have gone off the rails - but regardless of whether it ended in success or failure, every experience has given me new tools to further explore myself and my music. In a way, it's all been leading up to this project. Seven years of learning how music is supposed to be made have shown me that I don't always agree with the recommended method.</p>
<p>Hence, we're here. I have spent the last couple of years constructing and equipping Sanctuary Studio for artists like myself - those who endeavour to make music the way they <u>want</u> to make it, rather than the way someone else says they <u>should</u>. And what better way to start off than to do exactly that! Testing 1,2,3 may or may not be the release I <u>should</u> be giving you, but it is the release I <u>want</u> to give you. I hope the honesty and vulnerability in that impact you as much as it has been impacting me.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>After looking around in a number of places, I figured out that $4000 will cover mastering costs and minimum orders for CDs and t-shirts. Reaching this goal means that I will be able to release the music and send out perks as soon as is physically possible.</p>
<p>If we don't reach that goal, you needn't worry. The studio will still be open for business, the music will still get mastered, CDs and t-shirts will still get printed, it may just take me a while longer to pay the remainder out of pocket.</p>
<p>As for what you get for backing the project, there are packages ranging from solid discounts on CDs and T-shirts to some bonus music exclusive to Indiegogo backers to killer deals on studio time. Pictures of album art and t-shirt design options to follow!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Regardless of whether or not you can afford to back this project, word of mouth means everything to any artist. One of the biggest ways you can help is by telling your friends and family about this project, about the studio, and about my music and encouraging them to share it with their friends and family, etc.</p>

<h3>Slovenly &amp; We're Loud Fest</h3>
<p>Here's some background on the event and the people behind it:</p>
<ul>
<li>We're Loud Fest is organized by the people behind <a href=""http://www.slovenly.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Slovenly Recordings</a>
</li>
<li>This will be the 3rd edition of the We're Loud Fest.<br/>Websites for past editions in Greece: <a href=""http://slovenly.com/were-loud-fest/2015-2/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">2015</a> / <a href=""http://slovenly.com/wereloudfest/2016/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">2016</a>
</li>
<li>Facebook events for We're Loud 2017: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/709040202605102/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Puerto Rico</a> / <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/1250671238319413/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mexico City</a><br/>websites coming soon!</li>
<li>The festival will travel with us to our favorite places, which tend to be in the midst of political &amp; economic crises. We don't let it stop us.</li>
<li>We're Loud 2016 in Greece was an amazing success in that it was great fun, and — for those who were around for all or most of the trip — an unforgettable experience. But the Fest was supposed to start in Istanbul, and we had already booked more than 20 flight tickets, hotel rooms, and a venue with a 750 euros deposit. And then, a string of terrorist attacks followed by a failed military coup led to our decision to move, and all of that money (around $5000 USD) was lost.<br/><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/pS55VIBd-bw?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div>
</li>
<li><p>We are driven to bring amazing festivals to unlikely places. Places that don't get many festivals of this type. The locals are hungry, and extremely appreciative, and so when we manage to make it happen, the Fest is extra special. But as our 2016 experience shows, it's quite risky. That's why we've decided to try the crowdfunding approach — so that at least the financial side of the risk can be taken collectively. We don't mind risking our time &amp; energy, but it's a bit too much for us to be alone in bearing the financial risk.</p></li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We're looking to bring around six foreign bands to the Puerto Rican &amp; Mexican audience. Flights cost around $500-$1000 per musician. <br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1482397144/drcqfgoqlvlnuer9lnjm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/> </li>

(note: we're out of white size Sm &amp; Med!)</li>
<li>The more money we raise, the more bands we can bring. Kids in these places are stoked - most bands never manage to make the trip.<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1482397292/uljxujthqrbpfxpcfcgx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>
</li>
<li>If we raise more than $25k, we'll have a drawing, and the winner will get flights &amp; event tickets for one Broke Ass Friend!<br/> </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>WE'RE LOUD is not your ordinary FEST</h3>

Here's some background on the event and the people behind it:

We're Loud Fest is organized by the people behind Slovenly Recordings

This will be the 3rd edition of the We're Loud Fest.Websites for past editions in Greece: 2015 / 2016

Facebook events for We're Loud 2017: Puerto Rico / Mexico Citywebsites coming soon!
The festival will travel with us to our favorite places, which tend to be in the midst of political & economic crises. We don't let it stop us.
We're Loud 2016 in Greece was an amazing success in that it was great fun, and — for those who were around for all or most of the trip — an unforgettable experience. But the Fest was supposed to start in Istanbul, and we had already booked more than 20 flight tickets, hotel rooms, and a venue with a 750 euros deposit. And then, a string of terrorist attacks followed by a failed military coup led to our decision to move, and all of that money (around $5000 USD) was lost.

We are driven to bring amazing festivals to unlikely places. Places that don't get many festivals of this type. The locals are hungry, and extremely appreciative, and so when we manage to make it happen, the Fest is extra special. But as our 2016 experience shows, it's quite risky. That's why we've decided to try the crowdfunding approach — so that at least the financial side of the risk can be taken collectively. We don't mind risking our time & energy, but it's a bit too much for us to be alone in bearing the financial risk.


What We Need & What You Get

We're looking to bring around six foreign bands to the Puerto Rican & Mexican audience. Flights cost around $500-$1000 per musician.  
We've got loads of records, t-shirts, and stickers that we'll send to all donors. Choose from  various T-shirt designs & many releases in our catalog. (note: we're out of white size Sm & Med!)
The more money we raise, the more bands we can bring. Kids in these places are stoked - most bands never manage to make the trip.

If we raise more than $25k, we'll have a drawing, and the winner will get flights & event tickets for one Broke Ass Friend! 


WE'RE LOUD is not your ordinary FEST
...it's more like a family gathering. A beer-soaked wedding that the bride & groom didn't show up for. A rock'n'roll adventure vacation. It's not only about the music, but about the place, its people, the food, and of course, the booze! And loads of other surprises.
What surprises? Well... if we tell you, they won't be surprises anymore, but here's an excerpt of what Marco Petrovic wrote in his Heatwave Magazine review:...on the schedule it said “surprises on the island.” Little did we know that this would turn into one of the coolest days of our lives.

<p>Sometimes as an artist, writer, musician you can feel when it's the right time for something. That you have lightning in a bottle. That it's now or never. For me - that time is now.</p>
<p>Now you might know me from the four albums I released with Vagabondage, the two albums we put out from Rhubarb Whiskey, or one of the records that my other projects Feral, Sinners Tonic, or the Oakland Wine Drinkers Union released. I’m super proud of all of these projects - that we were able to do it all ourselves and that we got international accolades for every single one of the albums.</p>
<p>Getting referred to as a 'bluegrass Dresden Dolls,' or having 'a voice that is utter heartbreak and beauty all at once' - well it all feels pretty awesome.</p>
<p>Which brings us to now. About a year ago I launched my solo project the Secret Emchy Society in earnest. The bands were mostly on hiatus due to folks moving away or pursuing other art paths and I had some songs burning away in my soul that I needed to get out. So I played some solo sets with my friend - the Juno-nominated Carolyn Mark and I watched the audience reaction and reception to see how things might fly with a project that was just mine. And good news - things went awesome.</p>
<h3>And so...</h3>
<p>Sometime in the last few years when I lost many of the people I loved and started losing my own health due to job related stress I realized - no one else in the world can make the same music, or tell the same stories that I tell. Plus how many old school country acts with a queer lady singer do you know?  So I'm asking for your help to make the dream of the solo album come true.</p>
<p>How do you know that your $$ will actually get used right?</p>
<ul>
<li>I have recorded ten albums with bands previously - I know what not to do and how to save $$</li>
<li>I've also learned where and how to spend money so that albums get out into the world and have a life beyond just the crowdfunding campaign or just friends and family.</li>
</ul>
<p>I've seen the way people react to my songs and I want a chance to bring that joy, passion, and enthusiasm out into the world. This is an album of happysad, introspective, and rowdy songs exploring the human condition as it's lifted up and dragged under by love, friendship, grief, hope, road trips, and maybe a bit of whiskey here and there ;)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Details</h3>
<p>I worked in marketing long enough to know that planning, budgeting, and timelines are the foundation of success no matter where the money is coming from. The total budget for this project is $8000. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paying the backing band a solid stipend plus food / drink for recording ($1000)</li>
<li>Four days of recording with an industry professional who has worked with folks like Neko Case / Carolyn Mark and more ($1000)</li>
<li>Album mixing / mastering ($1500)</li>
<li>Printing the album on both Vinyl and CD ($1500)</li>
<li>Graphic Design for album art, ads, posters to promote the album  ($600)</li>
<li>Targeted ads in publications like No Depression, American Songwriter, Bust, and more ($2000)</li>
</ul>
<p>If we do not make the full goal I will scale back on the marketing and vinyl budgets until the project is at a place where I can fund it with the donations we did raise and my own savings. (FWIW my own savings is actually all going into the budget regardless).</p>

<h3>Other Ways to Help</h3>
<p>If you're too broke to contribute - that doesn't mean you can't be a part of this crazy dream! Please help by sharing the link to the campaign, telling folks about the project, or just come on out to the shows and say howdy. After all - this is about sharing music with you.</p>

<h3>Former Planets, you say?</h3>
<p>We've been kickin' around the Gainesville music scene for a little over two years now.  In that time we've been lucky enough to play shows with some of our favorite artists- you know, the guy from Less Than Jake, that main dude from Everclear, one of the guys from Weezer- some real quality name-dropping stuff.  People have had some nice things to say about us.  I think our shows are always a good time.  We recorded one album in 2015 that has some rockin' tunes on it, too.  We've spent the last year and a half working on new music for a second full-length album, and somewhere around the exact moment we were meant to begin, life happened.  By next summer, we'll be scattered across the country, and our time as Former Planets will have come to an end.  If you've enjoyed our music and/or supported us in the past, and would like to hear some of what we've been laboring over for the last year, here is your chance to help make it happen.  Your pre-order or special perk package will help us record as much of our unreleased music as possible, resulting in a digital release as soon as it is finished, somewhere around March of 2017.</p>

<h3>The Indiegogo Campaign</h3>
<p>We're trying to raise $1000 to contribute to the cost of making a great-sounding record.  We've chosen to start a ""flexible campaign"" to help make it happen.  This means what whatever funds we raise will go toward the recording, whether we reach our goal or not.  This also means that we are committed to finishing the project (a 6-song EP) and providing the promised perks to contributors no matter what.  Anything we can raise over the $1000 goal will add more songs to the release, with a full-length album guaranteed at $1700.</p>
<p>Here's a more specific breakdown for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anything we raise up to and including $1000 will go to our studio engineers who are producing, recording, mixing, and mastering the album (on top of our own personal monetary contributions).  At this point we will finish and release a 6-song EP.</li>
<li>For each additional $200 we raise, we can add another song to the record.  That's 7 songs at $1200, 8 at $1400, and 9 at $1600.</li>
<li>If we meet our stretch goal of $1700, we will finish and release a full length album of at least 10 songs.</li>
<li>If one of us dies in a unique way, resulting in a sensational viral video, thus somehow raising awareness to our campaign and raising more than this already ridiculous amount of money, the funds will be used to create and produce new band merchandise and place the record at digital retailers and streaming services.  And maybe we'll eat some caviar or something.</li>

<p>Carla Ruaro returns to the Amazon to take her instrument on a boat and navigate the Amazon River, passing through the communities and villages between Manaus and Santarém</p>
<p>The trip will begin in Belém do Pará, where the encounter with the composers and the process that they use in the transcriptions of bird song as an element of style and / or the modification of the original song will be documented for the creation of a new melody, composed for bird and accompanying instrument, interviews with composers, history and the accompaniment in the creation of the songs.</p>
<p>The trip will be recorded by a film-maker, and released on the format of DVD documentary, along with the CD containing all the pieces worked and presented at the concerts during the trip.</p>
<p>The union of the piano, the interpreter, the music of the forest, the composer of the forest and his people.</p>
<p>We will continue towards Manaus, together with the composers Thiago Albuquerque and Albery Albuquerque, who will accompany us on the boat, with the purpose of interacting with the audience and observing the reaction of the forest people when listening to their music, which uses elements that are part of their daily life but which will now be interpreted on the piano.</p>
<p>The purchase of the piano will be made in the city of Manaus.</p>
<p>Will be performed around 15 to 20 concerts on board of the boat.</p>
<p>Along the journey, along with the NGO Alma do Rio, will be selected a community or project that will receive the piano as a donation.</p>
<p>A little of the history and the relationship between the pianist and the Amazon:</p>
<p>It all began in London 2006 - with the formation of the Trio Brazilian Ensemble together with the violinist Felipe Karam from south Brazil and cellist from Pará, Diego Carneiro. The Trio was selected by one of the UK's largest instituitions ""Live Music Now"", and joined the resident musicians team. Together, they traveled for 6 years throughout England, Ireland and the United Arab Emirates doing concerts and workshops on Brazilian music and Amazon music for disabled children, hospitals and prisons.</p>
<p>The NGO Amazonart</p>
<p>Founded in 2009 in London, by the cellist Diego Carneiro, director of Amazonart Brazil / England, its international headquarters was supported by pianist Carla Ruaro since its opening in London. Amazonart organized charitable concerts to raise funds and support educational and cultural projects in the riverside communities of Belém do Pará. In 2013 it was awarded the Brazilian International Press Award UK in London.</p>
<p>Funarte Award</p>
<p>In 2012, the Trio receives the Funarte Award for Didactic Concerts with the project ""Multiplying Brazilian Music in the Amazon"". They then left for a trip through the countryside of Para state to perform concerts in places where, for the first time communities had the opportunity to attend a live concert.</p>
<p>Doctorate degree</p>
<p>In 2015 Carla returns to Amazonia, now with the goal of studying the music of local composers and forming partnerships. In this trip, she developed a research work to meet the repertoire available for piano. With the support of composers and professors from the University of Pará, she visited museums, libraries and collections in search of piano music. She also visited the indigenous handicraft fairs, where she acquired many instruments that reproduce the sound of the forest. In one of these meetings, she met Albery and Thiago Albuquerque, composers who studied for 30 years the song of the birds of the Amazon and the sounds of the forest, deciphering the musical style of each bird. She also met personally the composers Luiz Pardal, Lúcia Uchôa, Nego Nelson and Vicente Malheiros da Fonseca, and established partnerships for this research. With this material in hand, Carla went to Portugal, where she entered the doctorate course in musical performance at Universidade Nova de Lisboa</p>
<p>PROJECT DETAILED</p>
<p>GOALS</p>
<p>- To study the practice of using natural environments as an inspiring element for the composition of works</p>
<p>- To accompany the creation of a new work for piano</p>
<p>- Offer concerts to promote these composers in their own communities, especially places that are difficult to reach.</p>
<p>- Record this song and its creation process in CD and DVD documentary format</p>
<p>- To promote the contemporary music of composers from the Amazon region in Europe</p>
<p>THE CD</p>
<p>It will be recorded 10 tracks of the CD in Lisbon and 1 track with a string quartet at the studio in Belém do Pará. Compositions of Luiz Pardal, Altino Pimenta, Albery Albuquerque, Thiago Albuquerque, Lúcia Uchôa, Wilson Fonseca, Vicente Malheiros da Fonseca.</p>
<p>THE DVD</p>
<p>As a documentary, the registration will take place in the localities of Belém do Pará, Manaus, Alter do Chão and others along the way. Interviews with composers, visits to indigenous villages, concerts offered to communities and cultural spaces.</p>
<p>CONCERTS ON BOAT</p>
<p>It will be the biggest challenge, take a piano to forest by boat. Concerts will be offered in the islands and riverside communities of the Amazon River. The concerts will be organized by Paulo Randow, founder of the NGO Alma do Rio, who for years has been visiting and helping the communities of the Rio Negro and the Amazon River. There will be offered between 15 and 20 concerts during 10 days of travel inside the boat.</p>
<p>PIANO DONATION</p>
<p>The organization Alma do Rio will receive the piano used in the boat, and will select the most relevant project in the communities to receive the donation.</p>

<p>Tatiana Cobbett - artistic director</p>
</div><div>
<p>The only woman among the five children of film director William Cobbett and cultural producer Eliana Cobbett, Carioca Tatiana had the constant presence of art in her life. But it was in dance that she found the way to express herself. A dancer graduated from the School of Classical Dances of the Municipal Theater of Rio de Janeiro and before completing the History course at UFRJ, she accepted a scholarship and went to NY to study modern and contemporary dance at the Juilliard School on her return to Brazil, one of the most important Dance companies: the company from São Paulo Balé Stagium, with whom she worked for 13 years traveling throughout Brazil, Latin America, Central America and some European countries. She wrote, produced and performed in several shows including the musical Women of Holland, a work that was nominated for the APETESP award for the text and soundtrack. Choreographed for theater and directed several cultural institutions among them Pirandelo Theater in São Paulo and numerous other spectacles. At that time, singing and inventing verses were already the mark of the dancer. Her closest encounter with music was as producer and director of Shows, citing here some artists: Badi Assad, Carlinhos Antunes, Tutti Baê, Janete Machnacz, Grupo Rio Vermelho Trama Trio. When she moved to Florianópolis, Tatiana gave vent to her vein as a composer and, since 2000, develops an authorial work with 05 CDs released: Partners (2001), Bendita Company (2009), Sonora Partnership - Sudden Music (2010), Cut Sewing (2012) and Sawabona Shikoba (2015).</p>

<p>Organization Alma do Rio - production</p>
<p>Alma do Rio is the fruit of the project ""Five Years of Love and Defense of the Sweet River"", idealized by the educator, philosopher and environmentalist Paulo Randow. The denomination Alma do Rio (Soul of Rio) has the purpose of establishing a clear link between the social objectives of the organization and the essence of the water cycle, being the word ""soul"" derived from the Latin ""soul"" which means to animate, to move, to be. In this way, the denomination ""Soul of Rio"" aims to remember that we should be an animator of the process of the life cycle, by striving to preserve the natural phenomena that promote the flow of water.</p>

Along the journey, along with the NGO Alma do Rio, will be selected a community or project that will receive the piano as a donation.
A little of the history and the relationship between the pianist and the Amazon:
It all began in London 2006 - with the formation of the Trio Brazilian Ensemble together with the violinist Felipe Karam from south Brazil and cellist from Pará, Diego Carneiro. The Trio was selected by one of the UK's largest instituitions ""Live Music Now"", and joined the resident musicians team. Together, they traveled for 6 years throughout England, Ireland and the United Arab Emirates doing concerts and workshops on Brazilian music and Amazon music for disabled children, hospitals and prisons.
The NGO Amazonart
Founded in 2009 in London, by the cellist Diego Carneiro, director of Amazonart Brazil / England, its international headquarters was supported by pianist Carla Ruaro since its opening in London. Amazonart organized charitable concerts to raise funds and support educational and cultural projects in the riverside communities of Belém do Pará. In 2013 it was awarded the Brazilian International Press Award UK in London.
Funarte Award
In 2012, the Trio receives the Funarte Award for Didactic Concerts with the project ""Multiplying Brazilian Music in the Amazon"". They then left for a trip through the countryside of Para state to perform concerts in places where, for the first time communities had the opportunity to attend a live concert.
Doctorate degree
In 2015 Carla returns to Amazonia, now with the goal of studying the music of local composers and forming partnerships. In this trip, she developed a research work to meet the repertoire available for piano. With the support of composers and professors from the University of Pará, she visited museums, libraries and collections in search of piano music. She also visited the indigenous handicraft fairs, where she acquired many instruments that reproduce the sound of the forest. In one of these meetings, she met Albery and Thiago Albuquerque, composers who studied for 30 years the song of the birds of the Amazon and the sounds of the forest, deciphering the musical style of each bird. She also met personally the composers Luiz Pardal, Lúcia Uchôa, Nego Nelson and Vicente Malheiros da Fonseca, and established partnerships for this research. With this material in hand, Carla went to Portugal, where she entered the doctorate course in musical performance at Universidade Nova de Lisboa
PROJECT DETAILED
GOALS
- To study the practice of using natural environments as an inspiring element for the composition of works

Tatiana Cobbett - artistic director

The only woman among the five children of film director William Cobbett and cultural producer Eliana Cobbett, Carioca Tatiana had the constant presence of art in her life. But it was in dance that she found the way to express herself. A dancer graduated from the School of Classical Dances of the Municipal Theater of Rio de Janeiro and before completing the History course at UFRJ, she accepted a scholarship and went to NY to study modern and contemporary dance at the Juilliard School on her return to Brazil, one of the most important Dance companies: the company from São Paulo Balé Stagium, with whom she worked for 13 years traveling throughout Brazil, Latin America, Central America and some European countries. She wrote, produced and performed in several shows including the musical Women of Holland, a work that was nominated for the APETESP award for the text and soundtrack. Choreographed for theater and directed several cultural institutions among them Pirandelo Theater in São Paulo and numerous other spectacles. At that time, singing and inventing verses were already the mark of the dancer. Her closest encounter with music was as producer and director of Shows, citing here some artists: Badi Assad, Carlinhos Antunes, Tutti Baê, Janete Machnacz, Grupo Rio Vermelho Trama Trio. When she moved to Florianópolis, Tatiana gave vent to her vein as a composer and, since 2000, develops an authorial work with 05 CDs released: Partners (2001), Bendita Company (2009), Sonora Partnership - Sudden Music (2010), Cut Sewing (2012) and Sawabona Shikoba (2015).
 

 
Organization Alma do Rio - production
Alma do Rio is the fruit of the project ""Five Years of Love and Defense of the Sweet River"", idealized by the educator, philosopher and environmentalist Paulo Randow. The denomination Alma do Rio (Soul of Rio) has the purpose of establishing a clear link between the social objectives of the organization and the essence of the water cycle, being the word ""soul"" derived from the Latin ""soul"" which means to animate, to move, to be. In this way, the denomination ""Soul of Rio"" aims to remember that we should be an animator of the process of the life cycle, by striving to preserve the natural phenomena that promote the flow of water.",4.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Super Hi-Fi's unique Jamaican dub-infuenced, double trombone-led sound has been a hit with audiences since the band was started by bassist/singer Ezra Gale in Brooklyn in 2010. In 2012, we released our first album, ""Dub To The Bone"" (funded partly by your generosity on IndieGoGo!), and in the years since we've released 4 albums and 4 singles. Our new album will be our fifth full-length, and it's special because not only is it our biggest-sounding and most fully realized album yet (OK, OK, we do always say that...but we have always been right!), but because we are aiming to combine our music with extraordinary design to turn each record into its own little work of art. </p>
<p>Robert Swainston is an incredible NYC-based artist whose prints have been exhibited in galleries in the US and Europe- but don't take our word for how amazing he is, do yourself a favor and see his work for yourself at <a href=""http://www.robswainston.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.robswainston.com</a>. He also happens to be a old friend of Ezra's, and while Super Hi-Fi was recording their new album the pair hatched an idea for Rob to do the cover- or rather, for Rob to print each cover individually! </p>
<p>""I asked him to do the cover, thinking that he would be like a normal person and design a cover that we would then use to print the albums, but since he's not a normal person he wanted to do each one by hand"" says Ezra. ""You asked me to design the cover, so I said, yeah let's print each one,"" remembers Rob. And so the Blue and White hand-printed album cover concept was born. Rob works from woodcuts, so the album covers will be printed one-by-one on his printing press (named ""Laverne""!) at his studio in Astoria, Queens. This ensures that each cover will be unique- while they're cut from the same design, the ink coloring, shading, smudging and what -have-you will all be slightly different. </p>
<p>The point of all this is that this process echoes the aesthetics of dub music- the Jamaican-born musical revolution that has now spawned a thousand branches all over the globe, including one that holds Super Hi-Fi. Dub music was created in the 1960's when record producers in Jamaica like Lee ""Scratch"" Perry and King Tubby started manipulating the mixing process to turn recorded songs into different pieces of music by radically altering the arrangements and adding effects such as reverb and delay. These new pieces were called ""versions"" and were originally meant simply as B-sides for single releases, but soon became popular enough to spawn their own genre. Similarly, the covers for ""Blue and White"" will all be spun off the same source material (Rob's woodcut), but will all contain variations that will make them different from every other one in the series of 500- in a sense, they will each be their own ""versions.""</p>
<p>As you can imagine, this process isn't cheap. It's time and labor intensive, and while it's a labor of love for all of us, your support is crucial to helping us complete this project. We in Super Hi-Fi are committed to going the extra mile to make art that stands out and lasts. It's why we release our music on vinyl records- it's expensive, but we think they sound and look better. It's why we record everything onto reels of analog tape- it's expensive but we think it sounds much better. It's why we go into the recording studio and record a lot of material as often as we can- it's expensive, but we don't want to compromise in creating the best, most incredible works of art for you, our listeners (and for us too!).  </p>
<p>Your support will go toward all the aspects of making and releasing this record, from the printing of the record covers to the pressing of the vinyl records (at Brooklyn Vinyl Works here in our home borough), to the reels of tape we brought into Nine Lives Studio in Jersey City, NJ, to the studio time with our incredible engineer Nicola Stemmer, to paying all the incredible musicians involved, to hiring a publicity firm (Behind the Curtains Media) to help us get this music out to the entire world, to designing and printing the labels, to making two big videos (a stop-motion animated one for ""Little Black Book"" and a live action one for ""Gone"") . $5000 will help us enormously in covering these costs- and if we don't quite reach that goal, every little bit will help. </p>
<p>We're proud of all that we've achieved so far, and we're grateful for the support we have received that has enabled it to happen. Thanks for reading, take a look at the perks we're offering which range from pre-buying the record to getting all (!) of our records to prints of the album cover, and we hope you'll be part of this amazing project! And please share our project with your friends!</p>

<h2>How did this album get made?</h2>
<p>Blynd Birds recorded this record at one studio, and sent the recordings of each song to a different mixer/producer. </p>
<p>The producers are: Stuart Sikes, Kevin Szymanski, Jim Eno, Adrian Quesada,  Travis Kennedy, Danny Reisch, Mobley, and Adam Odor.</p>
<p>Each song was given a rough mix by Jared and sent to their respective mixer/producer with the same set of guidelines:</p>
<p>1. You cannot hear any of the other song mixes until you are finished mixing the song you were given.<br/>2. There will be be a short discussion over what the general sound the song should have.<br/>3. Mix and produce the song how you, the producer, would want to hear it and how you think it would sound best.  As if you would want to put it on in your car and listen to it often.<br/>4. You, the producer, will take that mix and send it back to the members of Blynd Birds only after you are completely done mixing. <br/>5. The members of Blynd Birds are only allowed to make two small changes to the mix after hearing the original mix.<br/>6. You, the producer, make the two small changes.<br/>7. The result of the changes will go on the album.</p>
<h2>Who are the Blynd Birds?</h2>
<p>Blynd Birds is Jared Blair (vocals and guitar), Sam Powell (keys), Simon Hillsman (drums), and Saul Arteta (bass). All are veteran musicians in Austin, TX.</p>
<p>This campaign is to help fund their second release.  The first release was in 2015, the Sure for Certain EP.</p>
<p>This release is a full length release including 8 songs. Each song was written by Jared Blair.  Every song was recorded at Black Cat Studios with Patrick Herzfeld. </p>
<h2>What will my contribution do?</h2>
<p>The band has spent well over 200 hours putting this album together already. Playing shows to raise money, writing, editing, creating sounds, arranging, and fine tuning this album to where it is now. All of the songs have been sent to be mixed by the producers named above. </p>
<p>Your contribution will go toward the cost of mixing and mastering all of the songs included on the record. The difference between a song that is just recorded and one that sounds wonderful on your stereo, not matter the song, is the wizardry that people like those listed above perform in their sonic laboratories. They have spent years and years perfecting that small difference between what sounds pretty good and what sounds amazing.</p>
<h2>Without the contributions from this campaign, will we be able to still make the record?</h2>
<p>The short answer here is YES. But, it's not easy to pull this kind of thing off. It will mean more debt for us and less money that could be spent to get more people to hear the songs. We take pride in not being beholden to anyone while making music. This allows us to make the best record possible and not have some rich jerk telling us that the songs aren't what he or she is really wanting.  In short, you are paying for artistic integrity and musicians that won't have to struggle quite as much.</p>
<p>The truly unique thing about contributing to this album is that you will have a glimpse into how songs change from when they are recorded to when they are mixed and mastered. Not only will you be helping to make the album, this is a concept that hasn't been done before in Austin, as far as we know. Sometimes you will get a chance to hear the rough mixes of a song you love by going down a rabbit hole on the internet: but, the chance to hear an entire album before and after it is mixed and mastered is a rare thing. You can A/B an entire album!</p>

<p>We realize that not everyone can help with this album financially. Hell, we are those people. <i><strong>If you can send this campaign on your social media to someone you think could and would contribute, that would actually be doing us a solid.</strong></i></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div><p> </p></div></div>","How did this album get made?
Blynd Birds recorded this record at one studio, and sent the recordings of each song to a different mixer/producer. 
The producers are: Stuart Sikes, Kevin Szymanski, Jim Eno, Adrian Quesada,  Travis Kennedy, Danny Reisch, Mobley, and Adam Odor.
Each song was given a rough mix by Jared and sent to their respective mixer/producer with the same set of guidelines:
1. You cannot hear any of the other song mixes until you are finished mixing the song you were given.2. There will be be a short discussion over what the general sound the song should have.3. Mix and produce the song how you, the producer, would want to hear it and how you think it would sound best.  As if you would want to put it on in your car and listen to it often.4. You, the producer, will take that mix and send it back to the members of Blynd Birds only after you are completely done mixing. 5. The members of Blynd Birds are only allowed to make two small changes to the mix after hearing the original mix.6. You, the producer, make the two small changes.7. The result of the changes will go on the album.
Who are the Blynd Birds?
Blynd Birds is Jared Blair (vocals and guitar), Sam Powell (keys), Simon Hillsman (drums), and Saul Arteta (bass). All are veteran musicians in Austin, TX.
This campaign is to help fund their second release.  The first release was in 2015, the Sure for Certain EP.
This release is a full length release including 8 songs. Each song was written by Jared Blair.  Every song was recorded at Black Cat Studios with Patrick Herzfeld. 
What will my contribution do?
The band has spent well over 200 hours putting this album together already. Playing shows to raise money, writing, editing, creating sounds, arranging, and fine tuning this album to where it is now. All of the songs have been sent to be mixed by the producers named above. 
Your contribution will go toward the cost of mixing and mastering all of the songs included on the record. The difference between a song that is just recorded and one that sounds wonderful on your stereo, not matter the song, is the wizardry that people like those listed above perform in their sonic laboratories. They have spent years and years perfecting that small difference between what sounds pretty good and what sounds amazing.
Without the contributions from this campaign, will we be able to still make the record?
The short answer here is YES. But, it's not easy to pull this kind of thing off. It will mean more debt for us and less money that could be spent to get more people to hear the songs. We take pride in not being beholden to anyone while making music. This allows us to make the best record possible and not have some rich jerk telling us that the songs aren't what he or she is really wanting.  In short, you are paying for artistic integrity and musicians that won't have to struggle quite as much.
The truly unique thing about contributing to this album is that you will have a glimpse into how songs change from when they are recorded to when they are mixed and mastered. Not only will you be helping to make the album, this is a concept that hasn't been done before in Austin, as far as we know. Sometimes you will get a chance to hear the rough mixes of a song you love by going down a rabbit hole on the internet: but, the chance to hear an entire album before and after it is mixed and mastered is a rare thing. You can A/B an entire album!
Who are these producers?
Don't know these folks? Here's an introduction:
Stuart Sikes:
Won a Grammy for mixing Loretta Lynn's Van Lear Rose. Stuart works out of his own studio in Austin, TX.
Has engineered or produced records from The White Stripes, Rocket From the Crypt, The Spinanes, Jets to Brazil, The Promise Ring, Cat Power, Black Joe Lewis, The Sword, Modest Mouse, The Walkmen, Phosphoresent, and Riverboat Gamblers among others.
Jim Eno:
Most widely known as the drummer for the band Spoon. Jim works out of his studio Public HiFi in Austin, TX.
Produced albums by band such as Spoon, Dana Falconberry, Heartless Bastards, Tennis, Will Johnson, and Alejandro Escovedo among others.
Kevin Szymanski:
Kevin currently resides in Austin, Texas and Nashville, Tennessee as far as we can tell. 
He has worked as an engineer, mixer or producer with Dave Grohl, Queens of the Stone Age, Foo Fighters, John Hiatt, and Velvet Revolver among others.
Adrian Quesada:
Won a Grammy with his ex-band Grupo Fantasma. 
Adrian is set up in his Austin house-based studio, Level One Sound. He has worked with such acts as Prince, Karl Denson, Daniel Johnston, The Sword, Natalia Clavier, and Ian Moore, among others. As an engineer he was recently tapped to record The Dap Kings at Level One Sound. He really does know everyone... (image credit: Texas Monthly).
Adrian is in about too many excellent bands right now, including Echocentrics, Brownout, and Spanish Gold. 
Danny Reisch:
Danny works out of his boutique studio, Good Danny's in Lockhart, Texas. Where he has engineered, mixed and produced such bands as Wye Oak, Okkervil River, White Denim, The Octopus Project, David Ramirez, The Bright Light Social Hour, Bayonne, A Giant Dog, and Grupo Fantasma.
Mobley:
Mobley's work has been marked by solitude, ingenuity, and a drive that could only be called obsessive. Whether you experience his music on record or at one of his incredible live shows, the passion is palpable. He records, mixes, and produces music that defies easy classification, drawing liberally (often simultaneously) from an array of musical traditions. He makes intricate, beautiful music, and has most recently been nominated for ""Musician of the Year"" by the Austin Chronicle.
Mobley has played one man shows all over the world as well as music festivals such as CMJ, SXSW, and ACL among others.
Travis Kennedy:
Travis began his professional career at Electric Lady Studios in NYC where he worked along side Grammy award winning producers engineers and artists. Travis has worked with major labels as well as independent local Austin artists and is currently mixing out of his personal mixing suite.

<p>Thank you for supporting us in unveiling the music of Liza Lehmann!</p>
<p>Liza Lehmann (1862 – 1918) was an English soprano and composer, known for her vocal compositions. After vocal studies with Alberto Randegger and Jenny Lind, and composition studies with teachers including Hamish MacCunn, Lehmann made her singing debut in 1885 in London and pursued a concert career for nearly a decade.</p>
<p>She married the composer and painter Herbert Bedford in 1894 and retired willingly from the concert stage. Following her marriage she devoted herself to writing music and teaching voice. Her first project was to make musical settings of the famous four-line poems attributed to Omar Khayyám and “translated” into English from its original Persian by Edward FitzGerald. The work was published in London by Metzler and Company (1896). The set, dedicated to her husband, takes many of the elements of the traditional song cycle format, but adds rather operatic and theatrical elements in its use of recitative; highly dramatic, operatically-styled lyricism and ensemble singing.</p>
<p>Lehmann was a product of her time and society. Reading her memoir “The Life of Liza Lehmann” one is struck by her connection to many important artistic, cultural and political figures of the period. Additionally, this, her first composition became a prominent part of the early 20th century salon/music hall performance repertoire. Several of her later compositions gained almost equal familiarity and popularity. The song cycle was especially popular in the United States, where Lehmann did two concert tours in 1910 and 1911. She performed at least one concert here, in Chicago, in 1910.</p>
<p>Lehmann lived and thrived within the rules and customs of the society out of which she was raised. Her memoir includes several references that we would find offensive today. Despite this her compositions have had a resonance, appreciation and historical significance across racial, geographical and cultural boundaries. On May 14, 1920, the Union Baptist Church of Philadelphia sponsored a concert to raise money for a young Marian Anderson who couldn’t afford voice lessons after the death of her father. Unusual for such a cause, the concert was not a solo affair. It consisted of In a Persian Garden; and the participants, in addition to Ms. Anderson as contralto, were local professionals. The event made a profit of $566, which was more than enough to cover a year of training with her final teacher, Giuseppi Boghetti.</p>
<p>This very special piece is a view on the meaning of life seen through overlapping lenses. Omar Khayyám's mystical poem, translated (inaccurately) by Edward FitzGerald, set to music by Ms. Lehmann and performed by 5 expressive musicians provides an opportunity for all participants to gather in the Garden and reflect on the intention with which we should live.</p>

<div><p><strong><i>Music Video, ""Come Away"" filmed in Israel!</i></strong></p></div>
<h2>The Vision</h2>
</div>
<div>Welcome to my fundraiser campaign!  This EP album has been a few years in the making, and I know that now is the time to make this project a reality! </div>
<div> </div>
<p><strong><i>A little about me</i></strong>...I love to sing, lead worship and write music!  In college, I studied vocal performance and even took a songwriting class, although I got a little discouraged after receiving some negative feedback.  I'd always had a desire to write music, but it wasn't until years later that my songwriting began to develop.</p>
<div>My first song <strong><i>You Are</i></strong> was written over 10 years ago.  It was inspired in a season when I was seeking the Lord for physical and emotional healing, and I finished writing it while I was in Israel volunteering with an international ministry.  Just a couple days later, I introduced the song in a live worship event.  That first song inspired me to continue writing music as I saw how it ministered to others.</div>
<div>I wrote several more songs that were penned during times of brokenness and discouragement. The music was really a gift of hope to me!  I could feel the Lord singing these songs over me, and I was overwhelmed by his presence.  </div>
<div>
<strong><i>My vision is to record an album so that others could know this hope and His presence</i></strong>. After introducing some of these songs at my church, I received a lot of encouragement and was getting requests for a cd.  I bought some recording equipment and began making demos of my songs.  I soon began to realize, however,  that I was going to need lots of help to make a quality album!</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong><i>Here are a few of the songs that will be included on the album:</i></strong></div>

<p>Most of my music is based on the Scriptures and the Psalms, such as <strong><i>Be Still and Know</i></strong> (Psalm 46), <i><strong>Ashira /I Will Sing</strong>  (Psalm 89),</i> and <strong><i>The Voice of the Lord </i></strong>(Psalm 29).  Recently, I was in Israel and had an amazing opportunity to film a music video for <i><strong>Come Away</strong> - </i>a love song based on the Song of Solomon.  We filmed it near the Sea of Galilee, at the base of Mount Arbel, and in Jerusalem.  It was such an incredible experience to be in the land where these verses were inspired!  Although the audio isn't a studio version, I couldn't pass up the chance to work with the amazing Michio Nagata and his team!  <strong><i>My vision is to film more music videos once the album is completed (hopefully in Israel again)!!</i></strong></p>

HALFWAY THERE!!!
Hello everyone!  I'm excited to share that I've raised over 50% so far!  This includes donations outside of the indiegogo campaign!! I have enough to get started in the recording studio, but still need to raise the remainder  to finish the album!!  Please consider sharing my campaign with your friends, family, church, etc...and help me reach my goal.  Thank you:))

Music Video, ""Come Away"" filmed in Israel!
The Vision

Welcome to my fundraiser campaign!  This EP album has been a few years in the making, and I know that now is the time to make this project a reality! 
 
A little about me...I love to sing, lead worship and write music!  In college, I studied vocal performance and even took a songwriting class, although I got a little discouraged after receiving some negative feedback.  I'd always had a desire to write music, but it wasn't until years later that my songwriting began to develop.
My first song You Are was written over 10 years ago.  It was inspired in a season when I was seeking the Lord for physical and emotional healing, and I finished writing it while I was in Israel volunteering with an international ministry.  Just a couple days later, I introduced the song in a live worship event.  That first song inspired me to continue writing music as I saw how it ministered to others.
I wrote several more songs that were penned during times of brokenness and discouragement. The music was really a gift of hope to me!  I could feel the Lord singing these songs over me, and I was overwhelmed by his presence.  

My vision is to record an album so that others could know this hope and His presence. After introducing some of these songs at my church, I received a lot of encouragement and was getting requests for a cd.  I bought some recording equipment and began making demos of my songs.  I soon began to realize, however,  that I was going to need lots of help to make a quality album!
 
Here are a few of the songs that will be included on the album:
https://soundcloud.com/sarah-benedick/you-are-unfailing-love-acoustic-demo
https://soundcloud.com/sarah-benedick/be-still-know
https://soundcloud.com/sarah-benedick/ashira-i-will-sing-demo-by-sarah-benedick
https://soundcloud.com/sarah-benedick/come-away-new-acoustic-demo-sarah-benedick
Most of my music is based on the Scriptures and the Psalms, such as Be Still and Know (Psalm 46), Ashira /I Will Sing  (Psalm 89), and The Voice of the Lord (Psalm 29).  Recently, I was in Israel and had an amazing opportunity to film a music video for Come Away - a love song based on the Song of Solomon.  We filmed it near the Sea of Galilee, at the base of Mount Arbel, and in Jerusalem.  It was such an incredible experience to be in the land where these verses were inspired!  Although the audio isn't a studio version, I couldn't pass up the chance to work with the amazing Michio Nagata and his team!  My vision is to film more music videos once the album is completed (hopefully in Israel again)!!
Here's a short video about the song:

<h3>We want to you hear this music!</h3>
<p>Laura Benitez &amp; the Heartache has been playing our unique band of original country music on the West Coast and nationally since 2012.  It's been 3 years since we released our last album, ""Heartless Woman,"" and since then we've developed a ton wonderful new music that we can't wait for you to hear. Our new album is mixed, mastered, and ready to press, so all we need now is your help to get it out into the world!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Reserve your copy now!</h3>
<p>Making music is a labor of love, but CD duplication is expensive, and vinyl pressing...well, let's just say, that's some next-level stuff.  We don't want this music to languish in Pro Tools, we want it out in the world where YOU can hear it.  If you like our music, please pre-order your copy now so we can get the album duplicated and into your hot little hands!</p>
<p>We know that there are lots of worthy causes vying for your attention these days.  We know not everyone will be able to give.  But if you'll be buying our new album anyway, why not buy it now to help insure that there IS a new album to buy?  You can reserve your copy, get some one-of-a-kind perks, and help us immeasurably in the process!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Power of Stories</h3>
<p>In a time of strife and uncertainty, music has the power to unify us, and stories have the power to grow compassion and awareness.  We have a lot new stories to tell on this album, and you can help us get them out into the world!</p>

<h3>Psychoriffadelia</h3>
<p>“Geezer provide hazy blues rock echoing through moonlit canyons under starry skies, a moreish Peyote for altering the minds of easy riders everywhere.” - Metal Hammer</p>
<p>The power of the riff. The allure of the psychedelic. The intensity of the electricity. These are the things that bring us together, these are the things that create Psychoriffadelia. </p>
<p>Recorded mostly live at Redbird Studio on 9/10/16 in New York City, the songs of Psychoriffadelia came together over the course of that summer. It had been months since we turned in the masters for our self titled album, yet still a few months until the album was released. We had been playing shows with Charles Ruggiero on drums while Chris Turco was on a work related hiatus. During that time, riffs arose, jams happened and songs were created. We wanted to capture that moment, no matter how fleeting. </p>
<p>""Psychoriffadelia is the result of Geezer firing at max volume on all cylinders, expanding on the self-titled while reinforcing that album’s accomplishments with a brazen next step forward. Don’t be fooled by the quick turnaround — there’s growth here."" - The Obelisk</p>
<p>Since 2010, Geezer has been bridging the gaps between the heavy, the trippy and the groovy to create a distinct form of Cosmic Stoner Blues. Over the years, we’ve released multiple albums, played many shows throughout the Northeastern US, done a short tour out to Detroit and back and shared the stage with the likes of High On Fire, Earthless, Wo Fat, Mothership, King Buffalo and many others. Soon we will even be playing a gig with Zakk Sabbath, Zakk Wylde’s Black Sabbath cover project! Over this time, we have developed an amazing and devoted international following, many of whom reside in Europe. With this new album and tour, we are hoping to finally give our European fans what they’ve been waiting for, a chance to experience Geezer live… for the very first time!</p>

<h3>Why a crowd funding campaign?</h3>
<p>While we are getting paid for the gigs and we will be selling merch along the way, getting the band over to Europe and making sure we have the equipment we need and the means to get where we are going cost A LOT of money. Frankly, the flights alone cost more than everything else combined.</p>
<p>The money you contribute will go directly to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Flights to and from Europe</li>
<li>Backline gear and van</li>
<li>Travel visas for the UK</li>
<li>Travel expenses like gas and tolls</li>
<li>The manufacturing of the new album on vinyl and other perks</li>

<h3>Perks</h3>
<p>The Featured Perk of this campaign is the Exclusive Die Hard Vinyl Edition of our new album, Psychoriffadelia. Although this album is already available on vinyl through Kozmik Artifactz Records (Germany) and STB Records (US), the “Die Hard” Edition is only available through this campaign. The Die Hard vinyl includes a hand screened jacket of alternate artwork designed by Kim Zangrando, a limited edition “Geezer Live at Freak Valley Festival” poster designed by Jo Riou (signed by the band) and a never before available embroidered Geezer Planet patch. For a few dollars more, we’ll even include your name in the album credits!</p>
<p>Many other killer perks are included in this campaign, we urge you to take a look and find which one best suits your needs. </p>

<h3>The Kolinmobile</h3>
<p>We are the Kolin, a pop art band from Hungary. The Kolinmobile is a trailer that we would like to turn into a mobile stage, a recording studio and a home for the band.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1515240587/su3olns6s1ekqioqvbap.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>As artists, we like to think out of the box. So we are going to build a ""box"" which we can open and turn into a mobile concert venue. We bought a trailer which we will rebuild as a multifunctional stage and studio. We will be able to move it to interesting places all around Europe and have spontaneous concerts or record songs at unique locations. Besides the concerts we plan to share the stage with different artists, like photographers, painters, dancers, or puppet performers. Also, we can organise workshops or round table conversations depending on the location or event. We believe that art is essential for everybody, and it doesn’t necessarily belong to museums, exhibition halls or concert venues.</p>
<p>Music is a universal commodity, which is enjoyed all over the world. As it is predominantly accessible for free (legally or illegally) musicians are forced to come up with more and more creative ways to actually make money for something they automatically should be able to.</p>
<p>With your help, we will be able to make our dreams come true and go on a European tour during wich we can perform our songs on our own mobile stage. Also, we will be able to record songs at unique locations and this way we can incorporate the atmosphere of these special places. According to our plan, these songs will turn into an on-the-road concept album, which can even involve musicians from all over Europe. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In today's world human relationships are getting more and more virtual. Our lives are more and more dependent on digital platforms, which has as many advantages as disadvantages. People can easily get alianated. Meeting people in person from different cultures can be an uplifting experience and getting to know different cultures is one of the best ways to make the world a better and more peaceful place. The main goal of this project is to interact people in an analogue way, maintain real human relationships and create music together, which is one of the deepest ways of human connection. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our band, the Kolin was formed in 2008. At the beginning we had quite a few successes, for example we were nominated for the Best European Act at MTV Europe Music Awards twice in a row and also, we won Best Hungarian Act in 2009 and 2010. And then we kind of fell apart,  because we thought that from then on things would just work out for us and we lost control of our music. A few very hard years followed, during which we realised that you can not rest on your laurels but you have to work hard if you want to keep going and achieve your goals. So finally, we pulled ourselves together and recorded a new album (KRIXKRAX, 2016). Hard work paid off because we got invited to the Great Escape Festival in Brighton, England, as the first ever Hungarian band, which was our biggest success to date.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1515242164/mloqwx48behv2stpdosp.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/qo65TgUdUx4?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>Having learnt that hard work pays off, we decided that we want to embark on a new challange and build our own mobile stage and studio so that we can create a new perspective for the band. And now we know that if there are any hurdles, we can overcome them by not giving up but rolling our sleeves up and get down to work. </p>
<p>We hope our project is interesting enough for you to help us make it happen. We are grateful for any donations. If you have any questions, please, feel free to contact us.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute you can still help by sharing our project on any social media platform or by letting your friends know about our project who might be interested in working with us in any way. For example, helping us with organizing our trips, finding us interesting locations to play concerts at or make recordings or connecting us with other like-minded artists etc.</p>

With your help, we will be able to make our dreams come true and go on a European tour during wich we can perform our songs on our own mobile stage. Also, we will be able to record songs at unique locations and this way we can incorporate the atmosphere of these special places. According to our plan, these songs will turn into an on-the-road concept album, which can even involve musicians from all over Europe. 

 

What We Need
To achieve our goal, we would need 9550 EUR. Please, take a moment to see the break-down of the budget.

Buying the trailer 800 EUR
Transporting the trailer to be fixed 200 EUR
MOT 200 EUR
Concept and detailed plan for reconstruction 500 EUR
Reconstruction materials 2500 EUR

Reconstruction itself 3000 EUR

Microphones, stands and cables 1200 EUR
PA speakers, mixer and amplifier 800 EUR
Lights 200 EUR
Decoration 150 EUR

Total 9550 EUR.

 
What You Get
If you fund us, you can get unique perks, such as digital copies of all our records, personalised polaroid photos, you can record your own song with us or be in a music video, or you can have a private concert in your own backyard.

You can have a puli finger puppet: 

Or your own polaroid picture: 

Even if we don't reach our monetary goal, we will start working on our project regardless, and we guarantee that you will get your perk according to your donation. If you have any questions about your perk, please, feel free to contact us.

 

The Impact
In today's world human relationships are getting more and more virtual. Our lives are more and more dependent on digital platforms, which has as many advantages as disadvantages. People can easily get alianated. Meeting people in person from different cultures can be an uplifting experience and getting to know different cultures is one of the best ways to make the world a better and more peaceful place. The main goal of this project is to interact people in an analogue way, maintain real human relationships and create music together, which is one of the deepest ways of human connection. 
 

Risks & Challenges
Our band, the Kolin was formed in 2008. At the beginning we had quite a few successes, for example we were nominated for the Best European Act at MTV Europe Music Awards twice in a row and also, we won Best Hungarian Act in 2009 and 2010. And then we kind of fell apart,  because we thought that from then on things would just work out for us and we lost control of our music. A few very hard years followed, during which we realised that you can not rest on your laurels but you have to work hard if you want to keep going and achieve your goals. So finally, we pulled ourselves together and recorded a new album (KRIXKRAX, 2016). Hard work paid off because we got invited to the Great Escape Festival in Brighton, England, as the first ever Hungarian band, which was our biggest success to date.


Having learnt that hard work pays off, we decided that we want to embark on a new challange and build our own mobile stage and studio so that we can create a new perspective for the band. And now we know that if there are any hurdles, we can overcome them by not giving up but rolling our sleeves up and get down to work. 
We hope our project is interesting enough for you to help us make it happen. We are grateful for any donations. If you have any questions, please, feel free to contact us.
 

Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't contribute you can still help by sharing our project on any social media platform or by letting your friends know about our project who might be interested in working with us in any way. For example, helping us with organizing our trips, finding us interesting locations to play concerts at or make recordings or connecting us with other like-minded artists etc.
Thank you for your help! And, as Mr. Phill Brown says: ""Keep Rolling""!",5.0,3,"1 Campaign

<div>I have been working on the concept for ""://NMDS LND<i>"" </i> for over two years. And while a lot of attention is focused on releasing singles right now, I am very passionate about storytelling. I believe this can only be accomplished in a longer format, which will also be a way to give more insight into who I am. So many people I have met have been affected by my music and this has given me fuel to keep going. I hope to be able to build an even deeper, more connected relationship with fans through touring and live shows. The genuine excitement about what I am trying to accomplish has kept me motivated, kept me going, and it's why I'm finally ready to make this album.</div>

<div>I decided to use crowdfunding for this album because it's a bit like patronage, a centuries-old tradition of helping art to develop and flourish.

</div><div>
<ul>
<li>The reality is, to make a high quality professional record that can stand against what's being released and that I can guarantee you will sonically love for years to come - requires a large attention to detail - especially vocal production and editing, mixing, and mastering.</li>
<li><strong>1/3  of the amount raised approximately $10,000 USD will go to music production.</strong></li>

<p><strong>And what about the other $20,000?</strong></p>
<p><strong>1/3 VISUAL CONTENT  + 1/3 MARKETING &amp; PROMOTION</strong></p>

<p>A PR firm will be hired to handle a two- three month campaign for the album. Promotion for playlists, dj's, and non U.S. radio are also accounted for. Please feel free to contact me if you'd like to see an in depth budget.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest risk is that my music is not able to find a large enough audience to get me to my dream and goal of touring the world. Making music is one thing, but being HEARD is quite another. </p>
<p>But I am confident that by partnering with the right PR team, and the right promotional components this will be possible. Having released on a major label, I know there is interest and belief in what I'm doing at a high level. There has also been a lot of new interest based off recent releases, and an undeniable enthusiasm every time I play.</p>
<p><strong>What happens if I don't reach 30k?</strong></p>
<p>I admit I'm nervous. This is no small amount of money I'm trying to raise, and the hardest thing to do is to ask for support. But I believe in this project and am confident you will be blown away with how it turns out. You can also see the success and hard work I've put in up to this point by listening to music on Spotify, Apple Music, or Soundcloud or checking out live videos on YouTube.</p>
<p>The music and ideas for this project are already in motion - so if I don't reach my goal, I will release a smaller version of the project in the Spring. This could be as big as a mini album, or as small as another single from the project. But whatever is raised will go to getting one step closer to this album.</p>

<h3>Who are We?</h3>
<p>Las Musas is a unique group comprised of more than 20 Salvadoran, U.S., and European women. These women are not all actively involved in the group, but they remain an essential part of the history and spirit of Las Musas.</p>
<p>Las Musas Desconectadas is a band of 7 women in El Salvador who are passionate about inspiring others through music and delivering a strong message of the injustices of the world. Our songs raise awareness of gender inequality, environmental protection, human rights, and social justice, among others.</p>
<p>In 2008, we started as Las Musas Batucada, the first all-female drum group, with the idea of claiming the rights of women artists in a society where there are few opportunities for women to express themselves artistically in public spaces. In 2012, after a few years of getting our foot in the door and finally making a name for ourselves, we participated in a national batucada competition, winning first place. </p>

<p>The following year, in 2013, we decided to take advantage of the musical talent each one of us possessed and Las Musas Desconectadas was born. Since then, we have had the opportunity to perform on stages for a variety of events on a national and international level. We were privileged enough to be the opening band for Natalia Lafourcade in July of 2016 and were invited by Katia Cardenal to participate in her Singer/Songwriter Festival in Nicaragua in November of the same year. Our focus for most of 2017 has been to finish the recording of our album in order to release it next year.      </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Last year we did a very intense, long, fun tour of the UK and parts of Europe ourselves, without tour or label support. We were there for 7 and 1/2 months playing relentlessly. We threw ourselves into it and came out realizing that the best way to make an impact is to take risks. We survived on the kindness and support of the great friends and fans we made through that approach. That's in part why we've decided to take the Indiegogo route to our next recordings.</p>
<ul>
<li>We are The Vim Dicta from Los Angeles and have been this formation of the band for 4 years but the first bits of songwriting began in 2010. </li>

<li>You will help us achieve the vision and passion we've been putting into our music for years.</li>

<h3>UNIQUE NEIL DIAMOND ""NOW"" TRIBUTE</h3>
<p><strong>Donate ANY AMOUNT in ANY category (even as a backer) </strong>and you will be grandfathered in as a<strong> VIP MEMBER FOR LIFE!</strong>  What does this mean for YOU our loyal fans?  1) Advance notification of all upcoming shows, and CD releases 2) the ability to purchase tickets to any show in advance of the public  3) to be close to the action you will have access to be able to sit in the designated VIP section members area for the show.</p>
<p>WE ALSO ARE GOING TO RUN A REFERRAL CONTEST WITH GREAT PRIZES SO, put your thinking caps on and look for that in the coming week RIGHT HERE.</p>
<p>Here is an example (of another Tribute band) of the production quality we would like to emulate. We would have large screens with projections of Neil Diamond from each era of the song performed as well as amazing lighting and effects. </p>

<li>Neil has often said, <strong>""The greatest form of flattery is imitation."" </strong>He avidly supports his tribute artists and even takes his mother to their shows on occasion. However, he also infers that some so-called tributes aren't all that flattering. Most all of those tribute artists also attempt to imitate his early days of success, with the big hair and flashy clothes.  <strong>I will be the only one portraying him in the later stages of his career, with the look and feel he still displays on his current 50th Anniversary tour, and including his newest songs from the Melody Road album and many others that most artists don't sing. </strong>
</li>
<li>Like Neil Diamond, ""I'm New York born and raised"" and later moved to Los Angeles, so ""Nowadays I'm lost between two shores...LA's fine but it ain't home, New York's home but it ain't mine no more.""...Yes, the famous lyrics of ""I Am I Said"" hold true to both of us. </li>
<li>
<strong>Growing up singing his songs since a young boy, I grew into his voice and actual looks. </strong>Thus, as I began singing more and more in public, I was told that I should seriously consider starting a tribute to him and his legendary songs. But that is easier said than done, and that's where you fellow Neil Diamond fans come in!!!</li>
<li><strong>With your help, I will be able to fund the best ever solo and full band tribute to Neil Diamond. One that will flatter Neil himself and hopefully his mother too!!! </strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WHAT DO I NEED AND WHAT WILL I GIVE IN RETURN???</strong></p>
</div><div>
<ul><li>Your contributions will help with still needed, and very costly, musical and sound equipment, stage lighting and props and backdrops, recording studio time, photo and video shoots, promo packages, projection screens,  authentic clothing, media marketing, and more... </li></ul>
<p>Here is an example from another tribute band of what we intend to accomplish for making our stage show AMAZING for YOU!  </p>
<p> The production quality we would like to emulate is costly but necessary for a successful show for YOU the FANS. We would have large screens with projections of Neil Diamond from each era of the song performed as well as amazing lighting and effects.</p>

<li>
<strong>But it's not all just about Me, and flattering Neil, it's also about You, his loyal fans!!! </strong>Depending on each individual contribution, I will be saying ""Thank You"" with everything from CDs and t-shirts all the way up to live performances at the venue/celebration of your choice...So check out all of my photos and videos, and then pick from a great range and level of support options.     </li>
<li>I have already started, with funding the name and logo, recording a first CD, some stage clothes, and of course hundreds of hours of practicing to be ready to perform for all of you. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<p><strong>HOW WILL THIS PROJECT BENEFIT OTHERS RATHER THAN JUST YOU AND ME??? </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Aside from bringing his music to you and people around the world, many of whom have never seen Neil Diamond live and in person, I will be donating performances to help with charitable causes whenever the opportunities arise.  </li>
<li>Although currently limited in my capacity to put on a full show, I already sing locally for both entertainment and charitable purposes. </li>
<li>I will be sure to keep all of my fans and supporters up to date via regularly updated media.  </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<p><strong>WHAT ARE THE RISKS AND CHALLENGES AHEAD FOR BOTH MYSELF, AND FOR YOU AS SUPPORTERS???</strong> </p>

<li>Fortunately, this is not a high-risk venture...I think you can see from the photos and videos that I am fully capable of the challenge ahead in fulfilling my end of this endeavor. With what we've accomplished so far,  I think you will feel assured that your contributions will not be wasted.       </li>
<li>In addition, I think you will get full value for your contributions thru the CDs, t-shirts and, for some, even live performances that you will receive as a thank you for helping.</li>

<h3>What are we about?</h3>
<p>Wholehearted's vision has always been to ""<i><strong>Inspire a generation of worshippers who live the songs they sing</strong></i>."" Using the gift of songwriting and the platform of local church, we have always wanted to see the church not only sing about the greatness of God, but actually live it outside of the 4 walls we meet in on a Sunday in a world that desperately needs to see it. </p>
<h3>Who are we?</h3>
<p>Wholehearted, simply, is the ""worship team""/""worship expression"" of Every Nation Somerset West, South-Africa. The name comes from our desire to give everything we have and everything we are to God. <i>True surrender of everything takes sacrifice</i>, and like David said in 2 Samuel 24:24 ""I will not offer anything to the Lord my God that cost me nothing"". This is our prayer. This is our heart.</p>
<h3>Where are we now?</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of 2017 God has taken us as a local church on a journey of <strong>DEEP DEVOTION</strong>. Looking at the early church in the book of Acts, we see that they devoted every aspect of their lives full to God, and that the fruit of that was <strong>GREAT JOY</strong>, many <strong>SIGN AND WONDERS</strong> that accompanied the sharing of the Gospel and that <strong>MANY</strong> people came to faith as God added to the church <strong>DAILY</strong> those that were being saved.</p>
<p>We believe that the songs being written during this time will be songs that will inspire people to go out and share the Gospel, stir in their hearts a renewed and deep devotion to God which will lead to great joy, not only for themselves but it will spill over to everyone they connect with.</p>
<h3>Why we need your help?</h3>
<p>It's an old Africa Proverb that says: ""If you want to go quick, go alone. If you want to go far, go together"". We realised very early in our journey that we can't do this by ourselves. We don't want to. And, with our GLOBAL COMMUNITY as it is, our combined reach is just so much further than we could ever reach by ourselves. We are better together, and that is why we would love it if you'd consider partnering with us on this project.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The first thing that we need is finances. Our total goal for this project is $22500.00</p>
<p>Here is the breakdown of where the finances will go to:</p>
<p>1. <strong>RECORDING</strong> - We want this recording to be WORLD-CLASS, so we want to find a <i>recording engineer</i> that will capture the heart and sound in the best way possible. This album will be distributed worldwide, so the standard needs to be on par. Of our total budget approximately $8000 will go to recording the album.</p>
<p>2. <strong>MIXING AND MASTERING</strong> - After the actual sound and music has been recorded, we need it to be mixed and mastered by a mixing engineer in the global <i>worship</i> community that has done albums like this before and can enhance the sound we already have and make it even better. Of our total budget approximately $10000 will go to mixing and mastering.</p>
<p>3. <strong>DESIGN AND PRINTING </strong>- When mixing and mastering are done we need to get the physical product ready for distribution.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our previous two albums were incredible. Not only because WE really love them, but because they were stirred by the Holy Spirit and has taken us on a very specific journey of trusting God and getting to know who He is and what He thinks and feels towards us and the world. We believe that God has an intense LOVE for His people and an even more intense LONGING for those who don't know Him yet to come to the revelation of who He is and how much He loves them.</p>
<p>We know that this new album will stir the believer to action. Because when you connect to the heart of the Father and your heart starts breaking, loving and beating as His does, there is no other response than to get involved with what He is already busy with. Sharing the gospel and showing the love of Christ.</p>
<p>Being a part of a global community of churches in Every Nation Churches and Ministries, specifically with Every Nation Music, we now have a way larger footprint than we ever had. So the impact of this new album could make waves farther than it ever could in the past.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We know that there are people that just can't get involved financially, but would still love to help us and get involved in some other ways. Here are two more ways that you can get involved:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Prayer</strong> - Please would you consider to pray for us as we undertake this journey. It won't necessarily be an easy one. But we believe in the power of prayer, the unity it brings in the body of Christ and the way that it can change the atmosphere in situations. So, even though some of you might not be close to us in location, please join your hearts with us in prayer that God would bless this project and lead us by His Spirit in the way that we should approach it. </p>
<p>2. <strong>Sharing is caring</strong> - Indie-GoGo comes complete with it's own set of SHARING tools on our campaign page. Please spread the word. Your SHARE, could make the difference between a half funded campaign vs. a fully funded campaign.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Please know that we appreciate every single one of you for taking the time to read, consider and invest in any way in this project! We can;t wait to share it with you!</p>
<p>Yours Wholeheartedly.</p>
</div></div>","What are we about?
Wholehearted's vision has always been to ""Inspire a generation of worshippers who live the songs they sing."" Using the gift of songwriting and the platform of local church, we have always wanted to see the church not only sing about the greatness of God, but actually live it outside of the 4 walls we meet in on a Sunday in a world that desperately needs to see it. 
Who are we?
Wholehearted, simply, is the ""worship team""/""worship expression"" of Every Nation Somerset West, South-Africa. The name comes from our desire to give everything we have and everything we are to God. True surrender of everything takes sacrifice, and like David said in 2 Samuel 24:24 ""I will not offer anything to the Lord my God that cost me nothing"". This is our prayer. This is our heart.
Where are we now?
Since the beginning of 2017 God has taken us as a local church on a journey of DEEP DEVOTION. Looking at the early church in the book of Acts, we see that they devoted every aspect of their lives full to God, and that the fruit of that was GREAT JOY, many SIGN AND WONDERS that accompanied the sharing of the Gospel and that MANY people came to faith as God added to the church DAILY those that were being saved.
We believe that the songs being written during this time will be songs that will inspire people to go out and share the Gospel, stir in their hearts a renewed and deep devotion to God which will lead to great joy, not only for themselves but it will spill over to everyone they connect with.
Why we need your help?
It's an old Africa Proverb that says: ""If you want to go quick, go alone. If you want to go far, go together"". We realised very early in our journey that we can't do this by ourselves. We don't want to. And, with our GLOBAL COMMUNITY as it is, our combined reach is just so much further than we could ever reach by ourselves. We are better together, and that is why we would love it if you'd consider partnering with us on this project.

What We Need & What You Get
The first thing that we need is finances. Our total goal for this project is $22500.00
Here is the breakdown of where the finances will go to:
1. RECORDING - We want this recording to be WORLD-CLASS, so we want to find a recording engineer that will capture the heart and sound in the best way possible. This album will be distributed worldwide, so the standard needs to be on par. Of our total budget approximately $8000 will go to recording the album.
2. MIXING AND MASTERING - After the actual sound and music has been recorded, we need it to be mixed and mastered by a mixing engineer in the global worship community that has done albums like this before and can enhance the sound we already have and make it even better. Of our total budget approximately $10000 will go to mixing and mastering.
3. DESIGN AND PRINTING - When mixing and mastering are done we need to get the physical product ready for distribution. This includes the designing and printing of the ALBUM COVER, the purchasing of the cases that the cds will be in, and then the actual ""printing""/reproduction of the album. Of our total budget approximately $3000 will to towards this.
4. PERKS - The remainder of the budget, and anything that we get over and above this, will go towards making sure that every backer gets the specific perk that they've signed up for.
We're really excited about the perks we have to offer!! From signed copies of the NEW ALBUM to Limited Edition Wholehearted Coffee, Wholehearted Caps, Handmade African bags and even an album home recorded just for you with songs written for you that you give the themes for!

<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>Hey Frans!  In case nobody's told you today, I love you and you are beautiful!</p>
<p>My name is Pam Taylor and I'm an American roots musician.  Music has been an important part of my life since I was a child.  I can't imagine a  life without it, can you?  Since losing my job 3 years ago, not only has it become my main source of income, it is my way of survival in this crazy world.   When my life took a dark turn over a decade ago, it was music that showed  me the way back home.  As a songwriter, it is my duty to document this journey and to be a beacon of light for others.  My mission in life, is to heal others and music is my medicine.</p>
<p><b>SO WHY AM I ASKING FOR YOUR HELP?</b></p>
<p>The music industry is changing so much and some would even say it is dying out but I disagree.  I see the music industry doing exactly what it's supposed to be doing and that is moving out of the hands of the big record labels and into the hands of the listeners.  You are in more control of the music you want to hear more than ever.  Of course, without the big record labels, the artists (me) has more freedom to produce the kind of music that's in our hearts and not stripped of soul, but who's footing the bill?   That's the only downside.  Creating a quality record can be pretty pricey.</p>
<p>Some of you may not know the truth behind the record label footing the bill.  From what I understand, they give you a budget then make you pay it all back with record sales.  If you can't pay them back, you're in default of their contract! YIKES!!  But, with sites like Indiegogo, it puts the listener in control of the kind of music they want to hear and the creator in control of what they want to create.  It's a win win.  Here's where you, the listener can become the creator as well as the producer. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I put a $20,000 goal for this project but the sky's the limit.  The more you give, the more I can give and the further I can take my music.  I am investing my own money that I've saved up to make the recording but I need your help to get my record the promotion it needs and to help me tour and Spread the Thread.  Here's a rough breakdown of some of the costs.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Studio time- up to $55 per hour  (I've already paid for 16 hours and have many more days to go)</li>
<li>Mixing /Mastering- up to $75 per song </li>
<li>Distribution-  $1200 or more to print up 1000 CD's . Plus Vinyl.</li>
<li>Postage- To mail to DJ's and Magazines,  About $4 per CD mailed. </li>
<li>Advertising- Some ads can cost up for $500 or more to run for a month. </li>
<li>CD Artwork- up to $300 for design work</li>
<li>Photo Shoot- up to $300-400</li>
<li>Radio Promotion- up to $3000 </li>
<li>Press/Reviews- up to $1500 per month of promo</li>
<li>Pay the musicians- Session musicians can cost up to $500 per day in the studio!</li>
<li>Tour Merchandise- Shirts, Koozies, Posters, Stickers, Buttons,... $$$$$ </li>
<li>Touring- To tour with a full band I will need to either buy or rent a van/bus.  (Good thing my Dad is a retired car salesman, he can get me a good deal on a used but reliable form of transportation. To rent a van/bus can cost up to $1000 per week. </li>
<li>Tour Promotion- Can cost up to $200 per show</li>
<li>Hotels- We all know how expensive putting 5 people up in a hotel can be.  Avg $80 pp/ per night.  This adds up.  </li>
<li>Food- Can't have a hangry band</li>
<li>Gas- Can't go anywhere without this!</li>
<li>Pay the Band- Obviously everyone hopes that the gigs will cover the cost of paying your band members but sometimes playing a new venue in a new town that only pays the  band based on the door cover can be pretty devastating.  </li>
<li>Musical Equipment- Keeping instruments maintained can be costly.   Strings, set ups, equipment rental if we play a venue that doesn't have sound/lighting etc. </li>
<li>Music Video- I've always wanted to create a storyboard music video.  This can cost an upwards of $1000 for quality production.   </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>With your contributions I can take this record and spread the thread of healing music across the globe.   I recently got a note from a Fran  I met while on tour in Savannah and she wanted to know if I had a song that she could let her daughter hear that was about courage and grace.  She was a victim of bullying and wanted to share music as a way to heal.. MY MUSIC!  I had three songs off the top of my head that was perfect for them in this situation but all I had was some grainy, low quality video to send her.  With your help, I'll be able to share with them an entire quality CD full of inspiring, healing music.   </p>
<p>The world is in a shift and everyone is feeling the impact of it.  Fear, anger and division is rampant and my music has a mission to heal,  to create unity and promote love and peace.  Love of oneself is the most important place to start if you want to change the world.  You know that saying, ""Be the change you want to see in the world.""  This is exactly what I'm doing.  I write songs about overcoming some of the darkest times in my life and that's what people need today.... To hear others making it out of the darkness. </p>
<ul>
<li>I want to shine my light so bright that the whole world can see.  The world needs inspiration and love and I've got tons of it.  Tons of songs.. enough to make at least 2 more records right now!  With any extra funds , I plan to start recording those as soon as I can.  </li>
<li>My first record Hot Mess was a testament to this journey.  I produced it myself  had no idea what I was doing and it hit #1 on the Roots Music Report, #3 on BB Kings Sirius XM Bluesville, and #25 on the Living Blues Charts and many overseas charts.  Plus several nominations.  </li>
</ul>
<p>It sure was an eye opener.  You're talking to an ex- addict here, one you'd sooner find passed out in a bar on a Friday night than playing for sold out crowds at one.  I have to pinch myself sometimes.  </p>
<p>You can rest assured that your donations are in good hands. I am working with some of the most talented musicians in the area to help create this sound I have in my mind for this record. Raw, Real, Organic.  </p>
<p>My music is real, the songs are truth and the message is clear. </p>
<ul><li>If you can't give monetarily, you still can play an important role in this project by sharing on all your social media platforms and helping me create buzz.  Tell your friends and family.  </li></ul>
<p>I want to thank you all from the bottom of my heart for even reading this far.  I pour my heart and soul into every song and this record is proof of that.  I just need your help getting it out for the whole world to hear.  My mission is to heal the world one song at a time so help me Spread the Thread.   It starts with YOU! </p>
<p>~ Be the Light, Give the Love, Share the Music &lt;3  </p>
<p>Love,  Pam</p>

The world is in a shift and everyone is feeling the impact of it.  Fear, anger and division is rampant and my music has a mission to heal,  to create unity and promote love and peace.  Love of oneself is the most important place to start if you want to change the world.  You know that saying, ""Be the change you want to see in the world.""  This is exactly what I'm doing.  I write songs about overcoming some of the darkest times in my life and that's what people need today.... To hear others making it out of the darkness. 

I want to shine my light so bright that the whole world can see.  The world needs inspiration and love and I've got tons of it.  Tons of songs.. enough to make at least 2 more records right now!  With any extra funds , I plan to start recording those as soon as I can.  
My first record Hot Mess was a testament to this journey.  I produced it myself  had no idea what I was doing and it hit #1 on the Roots Music Report, #3 on BB Kings Sirius XM Bluesville, and #25 on the Living Blues Charts and many overseas charts.  Plus several nominations.  

It sure was an eye opener.  You're talking to an ex- addict here, one you'd sooner find passed out in a bar on a Friday night than playing for sold out crowds at one.  I have to pinch myself sometimes.  
You can rest assured that your donations are in good hands. I am working with some of the most talented musicians in the area to help create this sound I have in my mind for this record. Raw, Real, Organic.  
My music is real, the songs are truth and the message is clear. 
If you can't give monetarily, you still can play an important role in this project by sharing on all your social media platforms and helping me create buzz.  Tell your friends and family.  
I want to thank you all from the bottom of my heart for even reading this far.  I pour my heart and soul into every song and this record is proof of that.  I just need your help getting it out for the whole world to hear.  My mission is to heal the world one song at a time so help me Spread the Thread.   It starts with YOU!

<h3>A Full-Course Meal</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Heidi Joosten, and I’m a performer, arranger, and composer living in Chicago. After years of practicing, performing, and perfecting my composition craft, I submitted my Appetite Concerto for Amplified Harp and Wind Ensemble as my Masters thesis in 2016, and am excited to announce this piece is now getting its world premiere!</p>
<p>On <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/1897383517175296/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">May 27, 2017</a>, the Appetite Concerto will be premiered by <a href=""http://www.chicagosymphonicwinds.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Chicago Symphonic Winds</a>, Chicago’s premiere professional wind ensemble. Conducted by Dr. Erica Neidlinger, and featuring harpist Jordan Thomas, this piece serves as the cornerstone for a groundbreaking program featuring works by all living, female, American-based composers.</p>
<p>Inspired by some of my favorite foods from around the city, this piece honors my own personal experience in the wind ensemble playing harp, while reflecting on the emotions and memories I associate with these dishes. In combining these passions, what resulted was a 4-movement concerto that featured the harp as a soloist with wind ensemble accompaniment, a genre that has never been approached before.</p>
<p>Movements include:</p>
<p>I. ""Cortadito"" from Cafecito<br/>II. ""Pepperoni and Spinach Deep Dish Pizza"" from Pequod's Pizza<br/>III. ""Skillet Cookie"" from Lincoln Station<br/>IV. ""Dirty Bastard"" from O'Shaughnessy's Public House</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Key Ingredients</h3>
<p>Considering the purpose, scope, and magnitude of this concert, it goes without saying that art ain’t free, and good art ain’t cheap -- that’s why I need your help! Oftentimes, people don’t realize the expenses that go into making and performing music, especially in the case of a world premiere. This campaign is aimed at helping to support these costs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rehearsal Space $0.00</li>
<li>Performance Venue $810.00</li>
<li>Percussion Equipment Rental $1,280.00</li>
<li>Amplified Harp Rental $900.00</li>
<li>Score and Parts Preparation $1,000.00</li>
<li>Fascinating Ribbons Purchase $125.00</li>

<li>Conductor Stipend $100.00</li>
<li>Harp Soloist Stipend $200.00</li>
<li>Musician Stipends $0.00 (OR $1,500.00)</li>
<li>Posters and Publicity Materials $150.00 (estimated)</li>
<li>Indiegogo Fundraising Percentage $250.00 (5%)</li>
</ul> <p>Total Project Cost $4,995<br/><br/>Our goal is to raise $5000, with any contributions raised above that amount to go toward a professional recording and stipends for our professional musicians, who are generously donating their time and incredible talents to make this premiere a reality.</p>

<h3>Nutritional Info</h3>
<p>As the culminating performance for CSW’s 2016-2017 season, this concert honors the American tradition of the wind ensemble. However, in a field historically dominated by the works men, this concert’s repertoire opts to highlight the current contributions of women writing for this medium. <a href=""https://www.adaptistration.com/blog/2017/04/03/how-many-dead-white-guys-does-it-take-to-program-a-season/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">When so few professional ensembles program music by living composers, female composers, or composers of color</a>, this performance challenges the idea that the American wind band tradition has to be that of “dead white guys.” Instead, this concert celebrates living, female, American-based composers and serves as a reminder that there is a place for everyone in music and the arts.</p>
<h3>In the Kitchen</h3>
<p>Partnering with an organization like CSW helps to alleviate some of the burdens, stresses, and difficulties in organizing a world premiere but I still need the funds to help make this happen! The Appetite Concerto isn't for light eaters, and even with the rehearsal schedule set, the venue booked, and musicians being contracted, there are still a number of costs to cover as these final pieces come together.</p>
<p>Despite the financial means necessary for this concert, the true value comes in the larger message that this program provides. While most people might think that life will go on without ""just another band concert,"" I truly believe that our community is at risk if we do not actively  celebrate, honor, and encourage underrepresented groups in music.</p>
<p>But good news! By donating you can help support this important cause, and get some cool perks while you're at it! Whether it's my eternal gratitude and thanks, a copy of the score, sponsoring a piece in the program, or a private VIP dinner, I would love for you to be a part of this process!</p>
</div><div><ul></ul></div><div>
<h3>Bon Appétit!</h3>
<p>Supporting music, art, and the humanities is important, now more than ever. With the very existence of organizations like the NEA at risk, I urge everyone to remember what value art provides and remember that more than contributions to the GDP, more than educational benefits, the arts make us human. As artists, we tell stories that reflect our humanity, and bring beauty and emotion to the world. My hope that is if you’ve stumbled on this campaign you’ll be one of the individuals who joins me in celebrating the voices of artists, no matter their age, gender, or race and consider donating to help make this concert possible. </p>

<p><br/><strong>Thats the Challenge I have given myself after all my former projects fell apart.</strong> Now on my own, I will give all my might for a very last time to reach my goals, to make these last years of effort come to fruition.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493995446/c1zuhj9i7ce0ymqvylxn.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/><strong>At my first </strong>Linkin Park <strong>concert in 2007</strong>, I found my drive for music and have given my best effort ever since. I wasn't part of a musical family or lucky enough to have any connections, so with Zero knowledge back then, I started building up in my home-country, Switzerland. <strong>I worked to be a musician.</strong><br/>I led, managed and fronted a band there for 8 years, coming to the realisation that we're stuck in Switzerland and that we need to give more effort into either touring or recording music. Unfortunately, I was the only person sharing that opinion, so <strong>I left on my own, investing 15'000£ + 12'000£</strong> living expenses to study a year at LIPA. <br/>Not having the finances for a 3 year BA course there, I decided to pursue the release of my band-work of the last 8 years. With a failed Kickstarter to finance the project, I went back to Switzerland to work for 3 months, saving up money to buy myself some ""time"" so I could produce music on my own. Fortunately, just when I came back to the UK, I found an amazing guitarist that was willing to work with me. Feeling his discomfort with playing pre-written songs in a new band, I adjusted myself and wrote new songs to provide fresh spirit to him and the session musicians he had found. <br/><strong>Yet, 2 weeks ago (End of April 2017)</strong>, after I've been writing and managing since November, he left the project, and with it <strong>my effort</strong> of that time<strong> went to naught</strong>... once again. <br/><br/><strong>All this happens while people around me thin nothing's happening, as everything falls apart before it can go public.</strong> <br/>With my frustration at a peak, <strong>I gave myself 2 more years. A solo artist providing everything within his skill-set producing content the best he can.</strong> If this fails, I will know the problem was never me not having the right band, it's been me not being good enough. If I can't make it with my very best effort, then I give up. But to figure that out, I'll give my best within that time limit.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493995484/fjugg62wo5f7easxfywu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/><strong>For years I have been a critical-thinking musician, acquired many skills that I had to learn in order to promote, lead and produce.</strong> My projects unfortunately never came to fruition, and I'm left with a skill-set that seems to be without value and years of effort with no beneficial outcome. <strong>It is frustrating to hear ""You're talented"" - ""Never Give Up"" - ""Success will come through hard work"" - ""You can do everything if you try hard enough"" if life seems to proof me wrong every year. </strong><br/><strong>What I want to achieve includes several things;</strong> I want to see if <strong>at the edge of my energy, these statements hold any truth</strong>, if the best of me, as a hard-working passionate artist, is enough to achieve something, something as in <strong>creating a self-sustaining YouTube channel, selling self-produced music for a living, communicate with fellow thinkers to create a network or even a movement. </strong><br/><strong>The other thing I want to achieve is the value in my skill-set</strong>. It seems that skills such as <strong>designing, composing, creating, communicating are worthless at the end of the day</strong>. No gain comes from it. Going to a 9-5 job that is mentally and intellectually destructive is more beneficial to living it seems. <strong>This is where I want to see if my skill-set will result in any value</strong> or if it's a hobby skill to have that dreamers make use of in their free-time.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493995507/d1bfl3kmra5ryjcyraa7.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/><strong>Within those 2 years, I want to dedicate 7 days a week to my work. 800£ cover 1 month in my situation. If I can sustain that, I won't have to sacrifice any time of those 2 years.</strong> </p>
<p>As I said, over these years I spent all the money I had on acquiring equipment, education, rental space, travelling costs etc. The good part of all this is that I am ready to work. I do have my instruments, I do have my home-recording equipment etc. <br/>So what really costs time is the creation and the self-education in case I have to learn something new, like just recently when I had to teach myself how to edit videos, how to encode them properly etc. <br/>Plus the creation of art is very time consuming. I find myself working 8-10h a day, writing parts, designing the artworks, writing sheets for session musicians, edit the according video, and outside of that I record gaming footage that will be uploaded as well, lead critical-thinking conversations that I will tackle in Vlogs, aimed at communication and exchange of thoughts and opinions. Time is my most valuable essence at the moment. I have tried decreasing the amount of work by giving people major roles, but it never worked out, and these 2 years it's all about MY effort.</p>
<p><strong>So Why is the goal not 19'200£? </strong>Right now is the build-up phase. Specially during this phase it is crucial for me to give everything I can, also as proof to my supporters that I'm giving everything I can and produce material 7 days a week. I do not want 19'200£ and have the pressure of doing something fall away. I want support for the next 2-3 months so the people that supported me have me go through a 2-3 months test phase to see if I remain dedicated.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493995531/smxyeeqjof5mp8xhvbcz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/><strong>In the wonderful scenario of me getting more than 800£ a month, what happens then?</strong> <br/>Knowing how many artists and creative people there are out there, <strong>I always wanted things like YouTube, Concerts, Twitch etc. to be a collaboration</strong> rather than a competition. If I get more than I need, I will reinvest that money in either upgrading the production of my content (IF my audience wishes for better quality) or I will hire/collaborate with people that are in the same situation as me. <strong>As glad as I am to receive financial support, as glad they will be if I return the favour. </strong><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493995551/xqsjgzu85mdcrbbykqss.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/><strong>Daily vlogs (sometimes bigger, sometimes just a summary of the day)<br/>Original Music<br/>Artworks<br/>Tutorials<br/>Game-Content (Music for developers, remixes etc.)<br/>Thoughts on global / social affairs<br/>Stories of my life<br/>Experiences, Tips and Tricks</strong><br/><br/>My work will be very internet orientated unless possibilities arise that allow me to connect differently. <br/><strong>My passion in music will always be a major part.</strong> The things I write about can contain any topic. Most important to me is the honesty and energy my music harbours. It can go from a piano piece to an aggressive metal song to a more poetic hip-hop song or a mixture of all. At the same time, I compose soundtracks for short-films, indie-game developers or feature other musicians. <br/><strong>With my thinking and aim at my music I often come to question or discuss nowdays state of affairs,</strong> opinions and movements (mainly in regards to society). I often have hour-long conversation with a few people around me that seem to be just as critical as me, even if we don't agree on things, the conversation is still beneficial and pleasant and in my opinion, productive. To see if I find more people like that, I want to share these thoughts on videos and start beneficial communication with my audience.<br/><strong>On my journey I made a lot of mistakes and experiences</strong>. There are many that have the same questions I had back then, and back then I wished someone could have just given me an input on how to do something. Therefore I hope my experience sharing and tutorials will prevent you from rookie mistakes that will cause you to do it all over again. <br/><strong>Last but not least: the Geek-Game-World.</strong> After an 8-10h work-day of creating, editing, talking, and managing, I often turn to my Geek-Video game world to unwind and just not think too much. Yet, I have found myself and the people I play games with to have a lot of comedic, random moments that we thought would be fun to share. Our approach to games differs; we don't see a game where you get from the start to the end, we see them as fun games that inspire ideas, artworks, soundtracks, cosplays. <br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493995576/ejvgozsfa30tpnunlexp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/><strong>I said this will be my last stand, my last attempt my last effort.</strong> If I fail I will never attempt to make use of my passion or skill-set again.

As glad as I am to receive financial support, as glad they will be if I return the favour. Daily vlogs (sometimes bigger, sometimes just a summary of the day)Original MusicArtworksTutorialsGame-Content (Music for developers, remixes etc.)Thoughts on global / social affairsStories of my lifeExperiences, Tips and TricksMy work will be very internet orientated unless possibilities arise that allow me to connect differently. My passion in music will always be a major part. The things I write about can contain any topic. Most important to me is the honesty and energy my music harbours. It can go from a piano piece to an aggressive metal song to a more poetic hip-hop song or a mixture of all. At the same time, I compose soundtracks for short-films, indie-game developers or feature other musicians. With my thinking and aim at my music I often come to question or discuss nowdays state of affairs, opinions and movements (mainly in regards to society). I often have hour-long conversation with a few people around me that seem to be just as critical as me, even if we don't agree on things, the conversation is still beneficial and pleasant and in my opinion, productive. To see if I find more people like that, I want to share these thoughts on videos and start beneficial communication with my audience.On my journey I made a lot of mistakes and experiences. There are many that have the same questions I had back then, and back then I wished someone could have just given me an input on how to do something. Therefore I hope my experience sharing and tutorials will prevent you from rookie mistakes that will cause you to do it all over again. Last but not least: the Geek-Game-World. After an 8-10h work-day of creating, editing, talking, and managing, I often turn to my Geek-Video game world to unwind and just not think too much. Yet, I have found myself and the people I play games with to have a lot of comedic, random moments that we thought would be fun to share. Our approach to games differs; we don't see a game where you get from the start to the end, we see them as fun games that inspire ideas, artworks, soundtracks, cosplays. I said this will be my last stand, my last attempt my last effort. If I fail I will never attempt to make use of my passion or skill-set again. The best was not enough, the world wins. End of the story.",8.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am Star Swain. I was introduced to the public when a video of my impromptu performance of the National Anthem while visiting the Lincoln Memorial went viral in June of 2016.  The video has had more than 40 million views! Since that moment, I have received hundreds of messages, phone calls, and texts from people all over the world. U.S. veterans and thousands of Americans have expressed the resurrection of their pride and love for our country because of what they call an inspiring performance.</p>
<p>This campaign is about helping to make meaningful music that revives the unity of our country. It is about restoring our value for all humanity and healing the hearts of the American people. The outpour of love and support that has come from Americans from all walks of life is sincerely calling for more world-changing sounds that will inspire love and unity.  I want this, not for fame and glory, but for the healing of our nation...WE NEED IT!</p>
<p>YOU can help achieve this goal! Your contributions will help fund an album project that will include songs written to heal, bring joy and laughter, and unite our nation through music. Your contributions will also help these songs be performed live all over the country. We will bring AMERICANS together — all races, genders, and creeds — providing a beautiful experience of inspiration and love birthed out of a musical explosion!</p>

<h3>What We Need</h3>

<p> </p>
<p>The funding for this project goes towards everything needed to create a quality album and produce an exciting, inspirational concert tour that will energize all those who attend.  Life, love, and unity breathed out through the lungs of music will create a force like never before for the Home of the Brave...and your contribution to the project is what will help to accomplish this!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<p>We desire to make a huge social impact in the USA through positive and universal music that everyone can appreciate.  With all that our country has encountered and endured throughout this year, we need something that will bring us together through a universal language...music!  We hope to have impact the nation in a way that will inspire unity and togetherness to grow stronger as a country.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Challenge</h3>
<p>The major challenge that we may face is rallying what seems to be a divided country together to achieve the common goal of unifying to become a stronger nation through working together.  There are many social and political divides that plague America in this moment.  But, we can overcome this challenge by exposing them to a sound that heals and words that deliver a message of hope while awakening an appreciation for all who are the Home of the Brave.  A message of pride, a message of love for humanity, and a message of strength in unity is what will help us to overcome the negativism. </p>
<p>The voice that was heard singing in the viral video of the singing of the national anthem, is a voice that brought hope, revived pride, and gave healing to a hurting nation.  I believe it can impact the nation on an even greater scale.  One that will allow us to listen to each other and work together to find better solutions to continue to move our country forward.  Our voices together can have an even greater impact on our country in its time of need.</p>

The album will contain approx. 6 to 7 songs. <br/><br/>Working alongside with me on this project will be the incredibly talented producer, Javier Escudero. Javier has done some great work in the past with artists such as Dave Fiuczynski, Juan Perez Rodriquez, and more. <br/><br/>In the summer of 2015, I released my debut EP, “Fruta”, which was recorded live with my group the James Labrosse Collective, with special guest, renown harmonica player Antonio Serrano – who was in the late Paco De Lucia’s band for about 10 years. This was an incredible experience, and you can view the full live-session videos on<a href=""http://youtube.com/channel/UCx3c942MCgpjXopL8MwzfLg"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> my YouTube page</a>.<br/><br/>Now, my newest music has core influences coming from a blend of Flamenco and Jazz. Recently I’ve been experimenting using electronic music elements such as synthesis and sound design, as well as more American influences like R&amp;B. And by doing so, creating something very, very unique. <br/><br/>I love to have my audience feel something special, within themselves. I’ve found that mixing sounds of different cultures and backgrounds has always been a great platform to make music more powerful. <br/><br/>In order to complete this album, which we’ll start recording in November, I will need to raise about $6,000. – Which is where I need your help.

That said, it’s only been about 5 years since I’ve been back at it…writing with gusto and doing what I always felt I should be doing and loving it.  With so much original material piling up, it was only obvious that it was (way past time) to get into the studio.  So, I leaned on friends to figure out just what that meant and how to do it.

I get it.  Even if you aren’t able to I appreciate anything you can do to help me get the word out and make and make some noise about this campaign.  The Indiegogo share tools don’t do much to help on Facebook…people tend to not see posts shared from external sources.  But you can always mention me on social media and send people directly to my page for more info.   Let’s make some people FREAKIN’ HAPPY!I’ll keep ya posted on our progress!  Thanks for your support!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>Hi, my name is Remington Pettygrove and I'm a songwriter in Chicago. I started writing songs while I was in high school. When I moved to the city for college, I started playing in the subway. At one point I became a ""professional busker."" That means I was able to pay my rent and sometimes even have enough left over to get a $3 dollar sub at Subway. The underground scene taught me a lot. I spent a night in jail for ""tresspassing on private property,"" I was robbed, I often got free food and beer, I had pictures taken with me as if I were a celebrity, I got a ride home from an escort, I was interviewed by Chicago periodicals, I met and dated a few cute girls, I gave shelter to a homeless man for a night, and I earned the respect and friendship of some old-time street performers. Most importantly, this time taught me how to write and perform a 3-minute pop song because . . . well, that's all the time you have between trains!  </p>
<p>This record, entitled <i>Tiny Treasures</i>, is extremely dear to me because it is a collection of songs written from the perspective of a little boy. The songs are a genuine and candid view of a child facing the uncertainty of life, love, and faith along with their thrills. At this point he has only just been born—there hasn't been enough time to be let down by the world, and this is captured in his simple, sincere and, at some moments, naive points of view. </p>

</div><div>
<p>If I can reach my fundraising goal, I'll use the funds to:</p>
<p>1) Obtain a 16 track digital recorder.

<p>2) Obtain a digital keyboard. Recent advancements in digital keyboard sound technology allow an artist to get natural sounding, acoustic instrument sounds of high quality and synthesized sounds that are really quite limitless. Using a recent vintage keyboard, I'll be able to record string sections, Hammond organ sounds, horn sections, rhythm tracks, and just about any other sounds of which I can conceive. I won't have to hire horn players or oboists or Canary Island canaries to get those sounds for my recording; I'll play them myself.</p>
<p>3) I'll be able to get the necessary microphones and equipment to make the recording.</p>
<p>4) I'll be able to manufacture the CDs and CD artwork that will be the physical artifact embodying the recording. These will be distributed to anyone who contributes to the campaign and requests one.</p>
<p>Finally, these acquisitions will allow me to produce future recordings for myself, for Green, and for friends and musical acquaintances for years to come. Hopefully some really great music will be the result.</p>

<h3>WHY DO YOU NEED MY MONEY AND WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU GONNA DO WITH IT?</h3>
<p>Well, we already paid to record the album.  We hired Tommy Evans to produce it (he's in the band Secret Colours and he has a degree in engineering and he certainly seems to know what all the little knobs do) and he recorded a dope record!  Seriously, it sounds really good.  </p>
<p>Now, we're idiots so we figured you just record an album and then you're handed a limousine and an MTV award (they're called moonmen, but that's not important right now) - turns out it costs a lot of  money to actually release a record!</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p> Supporting the arts is a big deal.  We live in a time when the arts industry is largely dominated by Freudian-Capitalist ideology.  When we support the artists we know and love we are reinviting mutuality, creativity, imagination, and magic back into our communities and back into the arts.  </p>
<p>The concept for our album was inspired by a juxtaposing of a Joseph Campbell quote and the imagery of the Tarot card ""The Tower"".  The message was this:  if the tallest buildings of our time represent our society's overarching obsession with consumerism and material wealth, then we must reconstruct inner structures of being that transcend and replace the social cognitive constructs perpetuating and reinforcing our history of oppression and consumerism.  Finding strength in being the empowered, free thinking, dreamers, builders, artists, healers and lovers of the earth that we are.  </p>

The Impact
 Supporting the arts is a big deal.  We live in a time when the arts industry is largely dominated by Freudian-Capitalist ideology.  When we support the artists we know and love we are reinviting mutuality, creativity, imagination, and magic back into our communities and back into the arts.  
The concept for our album was inspired by a juxtaposing of a Joseph Campbell quote and the imagery of the Tarot card ""The Tower"".  The message was this:  if the tallest buildings of our time represent our society's overarching obsession with consumerism and material wealth, then we must reconstruct inner structures of being that transcend and replace the social cognitive constructs perpetuating and reinforcing our history of oppression and consumerism.  Finding strength in being the empowered, free thinking, dreamers, builders, artists, healers and lovers of the earth that we are.

<h3>The UNICEF 4000 Miles Album</h3>
<p>We're Pete Jenkins &amp; Billy Washington from I Set The Sea On Fire. Our goal is to record an album which brings together different artists and cultures from around Europe and the world. Recording directly in their home towns by taking our studio on the road, we can get a unique sound by recording different artists from contrasting countries and sounds on the same track. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To make this project run we need around £2000. This is split between : </p>
<ul>
<li>Van Hire</li>
<li>Equipment Hire</li>
<li>Other Travel Costs (Ferrys &amp; Toll Roads)</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We hope this album will bring together different local artists from around the world, and let them collaborate with artists theyd never think of collaborating with. This means we could be recording a guitar part in France, While the singer is recorded in Romania and the drummer was a street busker in Venice. Thats the kind of tone were going for. Recording this album will not only bring these cultures together, but any profit from the album will be donated directly to Unicef who are helping Child refugees around Europe. </p>

<p>Hi! My name is Jaime Page, guitarist and creator of Dark Universe. I hail from Perth, Western Australia, as does the amazing group of musicians I am lucky enough to have with me.</p>
<p>My main claims to fame are of having Brian May of Queen record my song Resurrection, working with Cozy Powell (Rainbow/Whitesnake/Sabbath) and a stint with legendary Perth band Trilogy and the power metal band Black Steel. </p>
<p>Dark Universe features the talents of vocalist Donna Greene, an incredible and emotive singer, Craig Skelton, a bassist, keyboardist and arranger beyond compare, and drum super legend Michael Burn. Michael for me is the perfect combination of Bonham, Paice and Collins, and I love his playing.</p>
<p>Production and engineering provided by Dr Stuart James, at Soundfield Studio. Stuart is a lecturer at WAAPA and is a master of sound design. He is also the nicest person on the planet, and he believes with all of his heart in the quality of the project.</p>
<p>In 2016 we recorded and released what was to become the Dark Universe album. The first installment in my personal life's musical work, Dark Universe is a dark, impassioned work; My life stripped bare, raw, hurting, loving, fighting and going down like a flaming ruin and rising from the ashes for a glorious death-roll. </p>
<p>Ok, so maybe I am a drama queen, but that is how we roll and Into The Black continues to traverse the issues that burn within us all, but with an evolved attitude of defiance. </p>
<p>Rather than succumb to this world, living in the shadows, Into The Black is an angrier album. The emotions run deep, the soul flame burning like hell, but these angels fight back.</p>
<p>We all feel very strongly that this is a seminal work that in another age might be deemed a classic rock masterwork that touches people's hearts and souls. These are not just albums they are pure emotion and that, to us, makes the best music.</p>
<p>These sorts of albums rarely get made in this world nowadays. It is music that grows and stands the test of time. Would a record company give it a chance?  In reality, no way. </p>
<p>We are not about making a quick buck; we are about love, art, emotion. Those are things most music business execs would flinch at when they meet for their board meetings to discuss shrinking profit margins. </p>
<p>And that is why we need you on board.</p>
<p>Without your help, this album may not see the light of day. That would be a terrible waste. It would be a spectacular achievement to be able to look back and say, hey, we did it, we beat the system, beat the odds, and we did it together.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get!</strong></p>
<p>If we can make it to around $8K AUD, we will have the money to complete the album and get it to the masses so that it at least has a chance to take flight, and hopefully soar into musical nirvana.</p>
<p>Should we be able to raise over that figure, we will push hard to get the album seen by pumping everything into promotions and the promise of touring, particularly overseas if we can get there. Perth is a long way from everywhere, so we are up against the world compared to most.</p>
<p>If we fail to reach our targets, we will still be content to have made an effort to get there, and the project will still have a chance of life, and we will honour your pledges.</p>
<p><strong>See the packages and perks for more details...</strong></p>
<p><i>For Perth residents</i>, I (Jaime) and possibly other band members will also drop your package in personally and chat about the album and life in general. Add a generous donation!</p>
<p>We feel that is a value-packed offering that does our project justice. We would love for you to be with us.</p>
<p>If you do see this, please share it with your friends, and let us make magic happen!</p>

<p>Jaime Page, May 2017.</p>
<p>About Jaime In Not Too Many Words</p>
<p>Jaime Page is a guitarist of very high regard. Last year she came out as transgender with the release of Dark Universe. Many might say this was either brave or crazy, but the music tells a story, driven by pain, hurt, emotional destruction and beautiful noise. The music would not be the same without this lifetime of experience. Jaime is proud of who she is and still commands the respect of her peers, and can hold her head up knowing that many have accepted her true self despite everything she has faced. A triumph of diversity over adversity.<br/><br/> </p>

<h3>The Paris Orchestra Challenge</h3>
<p>Hello! We're Shaun &amp; Erik. We do these crazy challenges where we form orchestras from strangers and do one-off performances. So far, we've formed a 68 piece orchestra from strangers on the London Underground, a 24 piece orchestra at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, orchestras from nearly 40 people attending or performing at Glastonbury Festival, and two tours of the UK, where we've performed with over 100 musicians in 10 days.</p>
<p>For our next challenge, we will arrive in Paris on 1st April and attempt to form an orchestra between 20-40 musicians in Paris, and then write an entire album of music, collaborating with them. Then, just 8 days later on 9th April, we will perform and record a live album, in front of a studio audience, in Ferber Studios, Paris.</p>
<p>As well as recording a live album, we will also be making a movie as the entire challenge, and concert, will be filmed by Mat from <a href=""http://www.mhgMusicVideos.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.mhgMusicVideos.com</a> on 6 cameras.</p>
<p>In addition, and because he likes challenges, Shaun is also only going to communicate with people in French. A language he currently does not speak. The only time he'll speak English is when he's singing. </p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Why crowdfund?</span></p>
</div><div>
<p>We self-finance all our challenges. There is currently no record label or producers who assist us. We believe in sharing everything we do with the people who work with us. <u><strong>So any profits made will be 100% split evenly between us, the other musicians &amp; film-makers.</strong></u></p>
<p>We have set a target of £2,800 which covers all costs for the studio, getting &amp; staying there, rehearsal spaces and £5 a day for us to live on. Plus €500 as payment for the musicians.</p>
<p>We are not taking a payment unless the project makes money. And we are not going to be living luxuriously, let me assure you. We do a full breakdown of costs at the end of the project, but let's just say all three of us are literally going to be holed up in one room the entire 12 days!   </p>
<p>Costs aside, we actually have some amazing things we think are worth donating for, including some incredible artwork by David Cousens at <a href=""http://coolsurface.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://coolsurface.com/</a> (paying homage to the wonderful Army of Darkness, of course!), special mentions at the concert, a song made up from your suggestions, and of course copies of a movie and an album that doesn't exist yet! BUY THE DREAM! </p>
</div><div><h3>What happens if we don't make the target?</h3></div><div>
<p>We've decided to go with a flexible funding option, <u><strong>so every penny we raise we keep!</strong></u></p>
<p>The closer we get to the target, the more chance we have of this happening. So please. Help us!</p>
<div><h3>What happens if the music/movie is rubbish?</h3></div>
<div>
<p>This is a question we constantly come across when we do our challenges. And a question we often get asked by the musicians when we first meet them. Could it be rubbish? The truth is, it might. Each and every time we do something in this way it's a risk. But it's always much more amazing than you would think. It's about investing in an idea, before it's even begun. Buying an album from a band that doesn't exist yet, playing music that hasn't been written yet. It's about taking a leap of faith and watching it pay off. Plus, look at these lovely reviews of the music we've done!!<br/><br/><i>“Beautiful music” - </i><strong>BBC News</strong></p>
<p><i>“Sent shivers down my spine.”</i> - <strong>The Independent</strong></p>
<p><i>“The result is truly magical. The creation of sound right in front of your eyes is something truly special.” </i>– <strong>Louder Than War</strong></p>
<p><i>""This is the best thing ever!"" - </i><strong>Glastonbury festival Glade stage</strong></p>
<p>Also, if it turns out to be absolutely cringeworthy then you've just invested in an amazing comedy. Win win.</p>
<p>We will also promise that if, when we watch back the footage, it seems like the movie will be dull, then Erik, Mat and Shaun will get drunk and do a director's commentary for you as well. WHO DOESN'T WANT THAT BONUS FOOTAGE? (actually, I think they've both decided to do that anyway now...)</p>

<h3>Over the last 5 years, I have been chasing my dreams of a music career. I have spent countless hours playing shows, writing and working to create something that I am proud of.  I wanted a product that not only I am proud of, but that I hope my fans can be proud of, too.</h3>
<h3>I play shows and meet many wonderful new people.  I put everything I have into what it takes to become a successful artist. I have continued to strive for what I believe in; my music and the relationships I create with my supporters.</h3>
<p>During the past year, I have been writing as much as possible with Nashville songwriters. I have worked with incredible talent to make this dream come to life. An incredible team has been created to deliver the best music and most innovative marketing possible.  Now, under Big Star Management, I will be working closely with that amazing talent to bring my music to life. I will be producing a 5 song EP with producer, Thom Daughterty, and I will be working with the creative directing team from ""Absorb"" to create new ways to keep my fans as part of my journey. </p>
<p>Now, it is time to come to my fans for their support and belief in my music. I need your help to be able to fund this project and to keep moving forward in my career. I want to make this campaign as personal as possible. I want you 100% updated and behind the scenes of the entire journey. YOU are the reason that I do what I do, and I will be forever grateful for the fire that you keep alive in inside of me.  With your donation, I will be able to get my songs out into the world.  I will be able to reach more people and gain more exposure then ever before.</p>
<p>You may ask, ""what are the donations being used for?""...... </p>
<p>The next step in this journey is to record my first EVER single, ""VEGAS"" with producer Thom Daughterty.  Not only to record the single, but to create a package that brings the song to it's highest potential. This song is by far one of the most fun and creative songs that I have ever dreamed up, and I can't wait for you guys to hear it! </p>
<p>The cost of the recording the single is $2500. The song will be released on every music domain, and those who donate will have early access downloading privelages. The cost of creating the branding and marketing is $5000. This will keep my fans virtually connected to my music! </p>
<p>This is a creative way for me to offer THANKS to my fans.  THANKS for supporting my dreams, my goals and establishing my place as an artist in the music industry.</p>
<p>With each donation comes exciting perks that I have personally created for you. Yes, I said perks!  I not only want to ask you for your help with this, but I want to give back to you!</p>

Now, it is time to come to my fans for their support and belief in my music. I need your help to be able to fund this project and to keep moving forward in my career. I want to make this campaign as personal as possible. I want you 100% updated and behind the scenes of the entire journey. YOU are the reason that I do what I do, and I will be forever grateful for the fire that you keep alive in inside of me.  With your donation, I will be able to get my songs out into the world.  I will be able to reach more people and gain more exposure then ever before.
You may ask, ""what are the donations being used for?""...... 
The next step in this journey is to record my first EVER single, ""VEGAS"" with producer Thom Daughterty.  Not only to record the single, but to create a package that brings the song to it's highest potential. This song is by far one of the most fun and creative songs that I have ever dreamed up, and I can't wait for you guys to hear it! 
The cost of the recording the single is $2500. The song will be released on every music domain, and those who donate will have early access downloading privelages. The cost of creating the branding and marketing is $5000. This will keep my fans virtually connected to my music! 
This is a creative way for me to offer THANKS to my fans.  THANKS for supporting my dreams, my goals and establishing my place as an artist in the music industry.
With each donation comes exciting perks that I have personally created for you. Yes, I said perks!  I not only want to ask you for your help with this, but I want to give back to you!

Our encounter profoundly changed my life when she invited me to translate “Ponto de Nana”, an African prayer for the old Deep Water Goddess to hebrew and participate with it in her show in front of 1000 audience in Salvador, Bahia, her homeland. (it was my second show), in a prayer for Peace Among Nations.
//Nosso encontro mudou profundamente minha vida quando ela me convidou para traduzir ""Ponto de Nana"", uma oração Africana para a antiga Deusa das Águas Profundas para hebraico e participar com ela em seu show diante de 1000 espectadores em Salvador, Bahia, sua terra natal. (Foi o meu segundo show), em uma oração pela Paz Entre as Nações.//
She inspired me to put my music out there and share it with the world. I have dedicated my time and all my savings towards the recordings in Israel, realizing my dream and taking the risk knowing: there is no other time but now!
//Ela me inspirou a colocar minha música lá fora e compartilhá-la com o mundo. Tenho dedicado o meu tempo e todas as minhas economias para as gravações em Israel, realizando o meu sonho e assumindo o risco sabendo: não há outro momento senão agora!//
And the Universe responded again, as I was deeply honoured when Mariene offered me to produce the Brazilian part of my musical artwork. It was a great pleasure and honour to work with her and the best ever Brazilian musicians in the studio in Rio: Jorge Hedler, Pedro Franco, Dirceu Leite, Marcio Mallard, Andre Souza & Joao Carlos Countinho just to name a few. We have put  great attention, love and dedication into this music. I am so thankful to her for this miraculous production!!!
//E o Universo respondeu de novo, pois fiquei profundamente honrada quando Mariene me ofereceu produzir a parte brasileira da minha arte musical. Foi um grande prazer e honra trabalhar com ela e com os melhores músicos brasileiros no estúdio do Rio: Jorge Hedler, Pedro Franco, Dirceu Leite, Marcio Mallard, André Souza e João Carlos Countinho só para citar alguns. Nós colocamos muita atenção, amor e dedicação nesta música. Estou tão agradecida a ela para esta produção milagrosa!//

<h2><strong>Naša priča</strong></h2>
<h3>Tko smo mi?</h3>
<p>Mi smo Ezerki i Sedum osmini, vokalno-instrumentalni sastav koji djeluje već 22 godine u Zagrebu pod okriljem Hrvatsko-makedonskog društva prijateljstva. Osnovala nas je Lena Djapić, rođena u Gevgeliji, na samom jugu Makedonije. Tamo gdje vječno sunce sja.</p>
<p>Lena je u Zagrebu posljednjih 30 godina, kao i još neke zagrebačke Makedonke u sastavu Ezerki. Ima nas petnaestak, nekada i više, neke su polumakedonke, neke Zagrepčanke, ima nas odasvud. Sve mi volimo makedonsku glazbu.</p>
<p>Znate li što znači Ezerki?</p>
<p>Orkestar Sedum osmini vodi Bruno Urlić. Bruno piše aranžmane za  naše pjesme i ora, svira violinu i dirigira. U orkestru su i kaval, tapan, gitara, bas, tambure i harmonika.</p>
<p>Znate li kako zvuči sedum osmini?</p>
<p>Ima nas svih dobi i profila, od 25 do 75 godina, svima nam je zajedničko da volimo makedonsku glazbu, ritam, veselje, toplinu. Mi smo čuvari makedonske glazbe od zaborava. I obožavamo to.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Što radimo?</strong></h3>
<p>Do sada smo snimili 4 studijska albuma i jedan koncertni.</p>
<p>Snimili smo i dokumentarni film kojeg ćemo premijerno prikazati ove jeseni upravo u Makedoniji.</p>
<p>Jako volimo nastupe uživo, zajedno s vama, našom publikom. Imali smo nekoliko velikih koncerata u dvorani Lisinski u Zagrebu, zatim u manjim kazališnim dvoranama ili festivalima diljem Hrvatske, gostovali smo u Sarajevu, Bihaću, na Bledu, da spomenemo samo neke. Najdraže nam je kad nas pozovu da nastupamo u Makedoniji. Veselje i trema istovremeno je tada na vrhuncu – izvoditi makedonsku glazbu pred Makedoncima, a dolazimo iz Zagreba!?!</p>
<p>Na albumima smo ugostili i mnoge poznate pjevače i glazbenike. Koje?</p>
<p>Morat ćete to otkriti sami slušajući neki od naših 5 CD-ova!</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>Zašto radimo kampanju?</strong></h3>
<p>Imamo poziv za nastupe u Skopju, Ohridu, Tetovu i Resenu ove jeseni, u rujnu u doba berbe. Divno doba godine!</p>
<p>No postoji problem. Nas je na pozornici oko 25. To je velika mašinerija koju treba pokrenuti.</p>
<p>Da bismo mogli otići u Makedoniju ove jeseni, potrebna nam je vaša pomoć!</p>
<p>Nedostaju nam sredstva za pokrivanje troškova autobusa do Makedonije i nazad kao i za troškove smještaja i boravka za sve nas u tih 6 dana.</p>
<p>Ukupno to je iznos od 5.000 USD koji želimo sakupiti putem ove kampanje!</p>

<h2>Our <strong>Story:</strong>
</h2>
<h3><strong>Who are we?</strong></h3>
<p>We are Ezerki and Sedum Osmini, vocal&amp;instrumental ethno-group from Zagreb, active for 22 years within the Croatian-Macedonian Friendship Association. Our founder is Lena Djapić, born in Gevgelija, at the very South of Macedonia Republic where the sun always shines! Lena lives in Zagreb for the last 30 years, as well as some other women who sing in Ezerki. There are fifteen singers in the group, sometimes even more. Some of them are half-Macedonian and some are Croats coming from different parts of Croatia. What we have in common is love for Macedonian music.</p>
<p>Do you know what Ezerki means?</p>
<p>Sedum Osmini (the seven-eighths) is our accompanying band led by Bruno Urlić who makes arrangements for our songs and oro's, he plays violin and is our conductor.  There are also caval-flute, tapan-drum, guitar, bass, tamburitza and accordion in the orchestra as well. Do you know how the seven-eighths rhythm goes?</p>
<p>What we all have in common is love for Macedonian music, rhythm, happiness and warmth it creates. We are the keepers of Macedonian music from oblivion. And we are crazy about that!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>What do we do?</strong></h3>
<p>So far, we have recorded 4 studio-albums and one live.</p>
<p>We have filmed a documentary that will be screened for the first time in Macedonia this autumn.</p>
<p>We very much like to perform live, together with you and for you, our audience. We have had several big concerts at Lisinski concert hall in Zagreb, then in smaller theatre halls or festivals all over Croatia. We've been to Sarajevo, Bihać, Bled, to mention only a few. The greatest challenge is when we are invited to perform in Macedonia. It is really special to come from Zagreb to perform Macedonian music in front of Macedonians in Macedonia! But we are crazy to do that.</p>
<p>On our albums, we have as well numerous famous guest-musicians. Whom? You should find our yourself and listen some of our 5 CDs!</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>Why are we doing this crowdfunding campaign?</strong></h3>
<p>We are invited to perform live this autumn in Skopje, Ohrid, Tetovo and Resen. In September, during the harvest time. What a beautiful part of the year!</p>
<p>But there is a problem. We are 25 people on the stage. That is a lot and it takes much resources to be moved.</p>
<p>To be able to go to Macedonia this autumn, we need your help!</p>
<p>We need resources to cover the costs of a bus to take us all there and back, and the costs of accommodation and food during the 6 days tour.</p>
<p>The amount of 5.000 USD we want to collect with this campaign as your contributions.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<h3><strong>How can you help?</strong></h3>
<p>Support us and make our live performances in Macedonia possible!</p>
<p>You can support us with financial contributions and in return you can get various perks – our CDs, books, tickets in the first row at our concerts and mingling with us in the backstage.</p>
<p>Or you can go with us to Macedonia as special guests!</p>
<p>You can spread our story forward, fast-forward, within your circles of friends, on social networks, through stories or songs!</p>

What we all have in common is love for Macedonian music, rhythm, happiness and warmth it creates. We are the keepers of Macedonian music from oblivion. And we are crazy about that!
 
What do we do?
So far, we have recorded 4 studio-albums and one live.
We have filmed a documentary that will be screened for the first time in Macedonia this autumn.
We very much like to perform live, together with you and for you, our audience. We have had several big concerts at Lisinski concert hall in Zagreb, then in smaller theatre halls or festivals all over Croatia. We've been to Sarajevo, Bihać, Bled, to mention only a few. The greatest challenge is when we are invited to perform in Macedonia. It is really special to come from Zagreb to perform Macedonian music in front of Macedonians in Macedonia! But we are crazy to do that.
On our albums, we have as well numerous famous guest-musicians. Whom? You should find our yourself and listen some of our 5 CDs!
 
Why are we doing this crowdfunding campaign?
We are invited to perform live this autumn in Skopje, Ohrid, Tetovo and Resen. In September, during the harvest time. What a beautiful part of the year!
But there is a problem. We are 25 people on the stage. That is a lot and it takes much resources to be moved.
To be able to go to Macedonia this autumn, we need your help!
We need resources to cover the costs of a bus to take us all there and back, and the costs of accommodation and food during the 6 days tour.
The amount of 5.000 USD we want to collect with this campaign as your contributions.
 

 
How can you help?
Support us and make our live performances in Macedonia possible!
You can support us with financial contributions and in return you can get various perks – our CDs, books, tickets in the first row at our concerts and mingling with us in the backstage.
Or you can go with us to Macedonia as special guests!
You can spread our story forward, fast-forward, within your circles of friends, on social networks, through stories or songs!
OneTwoThree OneTwo OneTwo, OneTwoThree OneTwo OneTwo, let’s go!
 
Why?
Because we are all crazy about Macedonia!
Thank you! Love from Ezerki & 7/8!
Baknež! (A kiss!)
 
Take a look at our documentary trailer!

 
Last but not least - i na kraju, ali ne manje važno: HVALA na pomoći Mariu, Igoru, Branki, Buci, Đuri, Vitu, Darkinoj mami, Juditi, svim Ezerkama i 7/8 u pripremi ove kampanje!

<h3>Analog Heart &lt;3 </h3>
<p>This whirlwind of music madness started for me about 10 years ago.   I was a victim of my own mental illness/addictions and I remember looking in the mirror and thinking, I can choose to live or I can choose to die...and I chose life, I chose music!  The very next day I put an add on craigslist and formed my first rock and roll band Analog Heart.   In those crazy 10 years Analog Heart has gone on to do a lot of exciting things that have included winning Rock Act of the Year in the 2018 New England Music Awards, opening for Bon Jovi at Mohegan Sun in 2017, runner-up in the 2016 Aloft Rising Star with Daughtry, and a semi-finals appearance in the WZLX’s 2016 Rock Rumble!  I truly believe that music has saved my life and not just one time but over and over again.  It is the only outlet where I can be completely free from my messy anxious mind and rise above it all.  It has been the only salvation in my darkest days pulling me back into the light over and over.  Challenging me, pushing me to grow and expand my heart, soul and mind. </p>
<h3>College &amp; Career </h3>
<p>In 2011 I decided to attend Berklee College of Music to receive a ""proper musical education.""  This was a scary decision to make for many reasons.  Number one: I didn't think I was good enough to be accepted at Berklee, one of the most prestigious contemporary music colleges in the world.  Number two: my father had dreams of me becoming an engineer, sorry dad.  Number three: not a lot of musicians actually make money professionally.  Number four: Berklee costs an arm and a leg... BUT to my pleasant surprise I <i>was </i>accepted and soon after I fell into teaching music.  Today I am proud to say that I am a successful entrepreneur who teaches voice, guitar, piano, performance and songwriting for over 30+ students a week!  Guiding children with music through this difficult crazy thing called life has filled my heart with so much purpose, passion and joy.  I feel endlessly grateful to be blessed with a job where I can continue to study music and to also support and educate our youth.  </p>
<h3><strong>American Idol</strong></h3>
<p>I went on to compete on the television show American Idol and I made it to the top 30 females in 2013 which was a CRAZY once in a life time experience!  Singing for Mariah Carey, Keith Urban, Nicki Manaj and Randi Jackson made me realize that I am capable of doing anything I set my mind to.  No matter how shy and insecure I am in ""real life,"" I can sing my heart out on national television in front of Mariah Carey, one of the biggest voices in music!  The American Idol competition also taught me how important it is to have tough skin in this industry and to take everyone's opinions, judgements, critiques and criticism with a grain of salt.  Idol has taught me that my own belief in myself and in my strength is the key. </p>
<h3><strong>The Change</strong></h3>
<p>A few years ago I decided it was time for some <i>change</i> in my musical exploration.  I wanted to experiment with this softer more singer/songwriter side of myself.  I wanted to make my own creative decisions and not be influenced by other songwriters.  I <i>needed</i> to discover and explore me, as a solo musician. </p>
<p>Coming into my 30s have been the best years of my life.  With the passing of time, hard work and experience I feel like I can now clearly define who Liz Bills is as an artist.  I know the kinds of conversations I want to have with my audience.  I want them to know that I see them, I care about them, and I genuinely love them.  I want to spread light, hope, positivity and empowerment.  If I can make just one person smile, put a little boogie in their step or shake them up and make them think, that's good enough for me.  I have risen from such a dark and painful place in my past and I just want to help others do the same. </p>

<h3>Why This? Why Now? </h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Justin Varnes. I'm a drummer, a father, and a newly-inspired composer. A few years ago, while I was watching several tragic events unfold in the news over a short amount of time, I asked myself the same question we all asked ourselves - Why? Why are these things happening? So I spent the last few years searching for some way to answer that question, and then a way to respond with action.</p>

</div></div>","Why This? Why Now? 
Hi, my name is Justin Varnes. I'm a drummer, a father, and a newly-inspired composer. A few years ago, while I was watching several tragic events unfold in the news over a short amount of time, I asked myself the same question we all asked ourselves - Why? Why are these things happening? So I spent the last few years searching for some way to answer that question, and then a way to respond with action.
As a musician, I felt the best way to respond was through composition. And as a white, heterosexual male, I felt it was important for me to show support for communities who not only look and act differently than me, but who have suffered at the hands of people who look exactly like me. 
Our appearance, faith, sexuality, gender, nationality, and many other facets of our individuality are being used to harm each other; sometimes through physical violence, but often through much more subtle yet equally painful ways. Your help in launching this recording will show support for EVERY person - regardless of whether they look like you, believe what you believe, or feel the way you feel. And that support is something we ALL need at times.
*This recording is not for profit. Any extra funds raised from music sales will go to Amnesty International to further Human Rights education.
 

How Can You Help?
The music has been written, and I've been rehearsing to prepare for the recording. The next big steps are:

What Do You Get?
For your support of this project, you can choose from a handful of ways to experience your contribution to this project.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hey guys! As you know, Down &amp; Dirty as a band hasn't had the best of luck. We've gone through everything from not being able to release music, to member changes, having our album leaked/ downloaded, royalties stolen, and even having to fight for our own name. After years of not being able to break the curse of releasing a song every couple years, we're trying to make things right and finally release an album.<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are no longer under Sumerian and that comes with unique advantages, as well as disadvantages.<br/>One of the major disadvantages is that we have a much smaller pool of money for financing large-scale projects like recording. Most people don't understand that making music can actually be quite pricey, with all the living expenses, travel, and the recording process itself. That's where we need your help! The bare minimum on a quality full length album is roughly around $10,000 USD. The members of this band have emptied thier pockets for the past few years (some even going broke for this band) with expenses like paying for the entirity of ""Heaven sent"" (recording/ mix, master/ Music video) completely. Keep in mind that we were charged with people thinking the label was paying for this project. It's gotten to the point that we absolutely can not have an album ready for you guys as soon as we wish without your help! Every contribution earns something tangible in return and we’ve also included high tier incentives that a lot of you will enjoy to help make our album and give input in the creative process.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Now with Ezekiel Pierson back in the band along with Christian Grey<br/>we can assure you guys <br/>that any fans of previous Down &amp; Dirty material will love this album <br/>We've even included a perk where any song of your choosing that you like<br/>that never officially got released <br/>will be re-recorded and will be added to the album as bonus tracks<br/><br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The Down &amp; Dirty Meme will live on :(</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We really wish we could carry this weight on our own,<br/>but without you guys, we can't make it happen any time soon! If you’ve ever enjoyed our music, any contribution helps even if it's only $1. But if you don’t have any money to spare,<br/>spreading the word and sharing this to all your friends and family is the next best thing!</p>

<h3>Who is Tyrone Hendrix? </h3>
<p>Born and raised in Oakland, California, Tyrone Hendrix was brought up surrounded by the rich local musical influences of the Hawkins Family; Shelia E.; Tony, Toni, Tone; and Con Funk Shun.  He got his musical start in church and, from there, honed his skills in high school with the renowned Castlemont Castleers.</p>
<p>In 2004, Tyrone relocated to Portland, Oregon, where he expanded his repertoire, adding elements of hip-hop, jazz, funk, soul, and Americana. While he is a self-described constant student of the art of drumming and music, he also gives back to the music community as a teacher through drum clinics and giving lessons to musicians seeking to hone their skills. </p>
<h3>Rhythm on Life Vol. 2</h3>
<p>After the Success of his Debut Album (Rhythm on Life Vol. 1) Drummer/Producer Tyrone Hendrix is gearing up to release his follow up album Rhythm on Life Vol.2 which will be available June 2019. The lead single “Start All Over” features Ronnie Wright (aka BeSpeak) and Internet vocal Sensation Ashley Jayy (Prince) will be available January 26, 2019.

<p>I feel very confident in this project. While there are some minor risks and challenges, I have confidence in my team and in the work already invested in getting this process started. We have already assembly the best musicians, mixing engineer and mastering engineer in the Northwest and across the nation, and they have all poured their hearts into the making of ""Rhythm on Life Vol. 2"" Many of these artists have donated their time and music. The majority of the cost for ""Rhythm on Life Vol. 2"" at this point boils down to the mixing, photography/video, mastering, and production of the physical cds and vinyls.</p>

<h3>It's time to Record My First Album!</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>I’ve been a performing singer- songwriter for the past 5 years, and finally have enough songs I love that now it's hard to pick the top 10 for this album. I have been laying down tracks for my songs with my dad, Falcon Christopher, in his recording studio, and saved a lot of money by having him produce my songs. We are finally ready to hand the project over to the recording engineer, Isha Erskine for mixing. He has worked with artists such as; Jeff Beck, J Cole, Maroon 5, Black Eyed Peas, Joss Stone, Macy Gray, Taylor Hicks, Ziggy Marley and many more. We feel confident that he will make every song shine. If I am able to reach my goal of $4700, then Frank Arkwright of Abbey Road Studios, will master the final mixes for the final polishing touch. Frank has worked with artists such as Elton John, Coldplay, Amy Winehouse, Oasis, Snow Patrol, Arcade Fire, ABBA, The Killers and many more. I am really excited to potentially have people of this caliber making my songs the best they can be.</p>

<h3>What You're Getting</h3>
<p>Just know that however much you are able to contribute, there will be awesome perks at each price, including things such as...</p>

<li>Signed CD's</li>
<li>Kaden Mylestone Limited T-Shirts</li>

<h3>What's in it for Our Community</h3>
<p>One of the original songs on my album is called 'Open Fire'. I was thinking about the Sandy Hook Massacre and wondered, what if one of those victims was meant to help the world in some way. This inspired the opening line of the song, ""What I could have been, what I could be."" I wrote this song to raise awareness on gun violence, and to prevent innocent children and parents from being victims of school shootings. That is why 100% of 'Open Fire' download profits and 10% of my album ""Blackout"" sales will go to  'The Sandy Hook Promise Foundation'.  Their mission is to; ""Enact sensible gun violence prevention laws, policy and regulations at a state and federal level, in the areas of mental health &amp; wellness and gun safety that result in the reduction of gun-related death and injury.""</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What if I don't reach my Goal?</h3>
<p>I am confident that we will reach our goal, but if I am unable to reach my goal of $4700, I have two options depending on the amount raised. If I can get to $3500, DiskMakers will be able to master the cd. If I am only able to get to $3000 then Isha will do a quick master on all the songs. In order to get people fired up to reach this $4700 goal, I will be releasing samples of preproduction tracks throughout the 30 day campaign.</p>

<p>At this point I hope you've heard the sample of my intro track, Gobinday Mukhande, created by myself and producer extraordinaire Krishan Khalsa, who will be producing my full length album. The track also includes the talents of Daniel Koncious Krieger (guitars) and Jared May (bass). If you haven't listened yet, please do so, <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/danielle-walch-903711243/gobinday-mukhande-sample"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>. I think you'll see that the potential for an epic mantra album speaks for itself.</p>
<p>It's my belief that creative expression is the essence and core of our authentic Self. By making a donation to this project you will be supporting EVERY PERSON INVOLVED in their creative expression and livelihood. ALL monies donated will go towards the payment of the production and recording of the album, musicians, promotional/marketing materials, manufacturing, etc. I feel ardent about paying people what they feel they deserve, especially artists for their work. Making a living as an artist can be a financially fruitful one as long as it's held in high regard and value, and as a community of consciousness building individuals, ensuring the longevity of our art and furthermore, our Dharma, is up to us. It's an essential part of my destiny on this path to contribute to the legacy Yogi Bhajan created, to my community, and to the lightforce on the planet. NOW is the time for our generation to contribute to the legacy.</p>
<p>My goal is to raise 20,000, and I have 60 days to do it. If I don't reach my goal within the 60 days I get to keep all donations and my campaign will close. If I DO meet my goal, not only will I have the money I need to complete a full length album, but my campaign will stay live and I'll be able to continue receiving donations. Why $20,000? To be transparent, it cost about $2500 to produce my intro track. A full length album is 8 to 10 tracks, and well, you can do the math. This doesn't include marketing materials, the mastering session, or CD manufacturing, etc. Hence why meeting the goal $20,000 is so important, because it allows me to continue to receive donations.</p>
<p>If you like our track and want us to create more music, please donate and share my campaign with your friends, family, as well as on your social media feeds.</p>

The recording process was a creative experience that pushed me out of my comfort zone, and onto honing my skills not only as a songwriter, but an artist. If you have ever been to one of my shows, or listened to my music, or just encouraged me to pursue my dreams this EP is dedicated to you. Thank you so much! Much love, Becca",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<i> </i>Support Music, Yoga, Art, Healing &amp; Cultural Preservation</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We are Uma and Ketan and we have been living in Ashland, Oregon, and now Nevada City/Grass Valley, California. Our Destiny is to go to Maui and start a Cultural Healing Arts Center where we can hold sacred space for healing and create and share powerful, yogic music and art that changes the world for the better. Mother India flows through our blood but being raised in the U.S. caused us to lose our Rich Indian Heritage. We were not taught our yogic disciplines in childhood, we had to rediscover it all within ourselves. After many years of study, trainings, meditations, and self-healing, we have cleared our channels so Creator can Express freely through our Divine Vessels. We are Ready to uplift and inspire with our beautiful yogic arts, and change the world for the better!</p>

<p>I am an expert healer, singer, dancer, painter, and multi-media artist. I am an advanced yogi and I have spent 7 years fully focused on gaining skills in the healing arts and doing my inner work to recreate myself through yoga. I am a lineage keeper and my ancestry is linked to brahmins, ayurvedic healers, freedom fighters that marched with Gandhi, and true yoga. I was born and raised in Ann Arbor, Michigan to Americanized Indian parents.</p>
<p>I have a certification in massage therapy, neuro-linguistic programming/hypnotherapy, and theta healing (a modality of healing similar to certain ancient yogic practices that involve connecting to ones higher self for guidance and transformation). I have hosted spiritual and musical events with attendances ranging from 3 to 200 people.</p>
<p>I am an expert counselor and spiritual doctor and have the ability to heal all ailments. This is because  me and my partner have spent the last 3 years focused all day every day on our own inner healing/inner work. We have purified ourselves, we have purified the darkness in us to such an extent that we are able to be clear channels for the Divine. We are extremely advanced psychics, and the music and art that God brings through us is world-changing-ly beautiful and powerful. By spending the time cleaning our inner selves, we are now truly fit to be spiritual leaders and hold space for others by sharing our gifts of song, dance, art, music, stories and wisdom teachings. We are extremely qualified to run a healing center for the yogic arts that would host events, retreats, and art projects that would heal individuals and the collective and change the world for the better.</p>
<p>I co-created with 2 other women an amazing event called Singing Alive on Kauai, Hawaii. It was a 3 day festival of song that took immense planning and coordination. I also offered my music at the festival three years in a row. I can now easily create large musical/artistic/spiritual events for up to 50 people by myself and 100s of people with a team.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1542656540/fbp1djqyflbxrd9kcskg.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I've done Sound Healings on Kauai worth thousands of dollars and I've helped countless people with their health and spiritual growth by offering<i> </i><strong>free</strong><i> </i>healing sessions for many years.</p>
<p>I trained in ballet and modern dance for 10 years and am highly skilled as a choreographer.</p>
<p>Basically, I am an expert at any healing and artistic endeavor I put my mind to and All I need are the right resources and space to produce creations that are incredibly beautiful, poignant, and world-changing.</p>
<p>Events, Retreats, one-one-one healing sessions, classes, musical recordings, books, multi-media art, videos, and films are all within my area of expertise that will create positive world-changing results. All I need is to be set up with my own home and a few acres, where I can host these events and create the music and art that will change people's lives and bless the world immensely.</p>

<p>I was born in Calcutta, India and adopted by a European family and raised in the U.S. have 10 years of experience and am an expert in the areas of in meditation, yoga, pranayama, counseling, healing, music, gymnastics/dance. I am an extremely advanced psychic, yogic artist and spiritual doctor. I am also an expert in creating sacred spaces and sustainable gardens.</p>

<p>I am a trained psychic and raja yoga lineage keeper. I have been meditating for 20 years and have developed my own form of meditation called Waking Meditation which is essentially open-eyed introspection/psychological dream interpretation; perceiving the outer reality as a creation of one's inner world. Everything is a direct reflection of our inner self and any physical ailment stems from the mind. Healing can occur naturally with the correct Space.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1542662037/clodw2flht72aw6lhpdj.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> I am an expert spiritual doctor and can heal any ailment known to man using my precise psychic senses to diagnose and cure the mental-emotional root cause of any issue. I have been training my senses for over a decade and I traveled around the American mainland and Hawaii for many years helping others for free with their spiritual growth. </p>
<p>Obviously our current system has not been working for everyone and has been causing destruction to our planet. Through deep meditation I was shown many new ways of living and discovered within my mind the Creator's blueprints for an entirely new system that is actually geared towards peace, prosperity, sustainability, and success for ALL. I am qualified to show others how we can use our creative abilities to live sustainably with the earth AND have all the luxuries of modern living. By healing the self of unnecessary desires, humans can live balanced lives with sustainable luxuries. Yoga is a life path which includes harmony with the Earth. In Maui, we can sustainably host and live-record music and art events on the land, sharing our inspiring creations and ways with the world and setting an example of the great potentials of man. Our Sacred Arts greatly uplift consciousness &amp; impact the Soul, and with the magic of Maui and our Powerful Indian Heritage, we can change the whole world for the better.</p>
<p><br/>*******<br/><strong>All we need are people like YOU, who care about the Earth and who value Cultural Preservation, Music, the Arts, Yoga, Sustainability, and Healing!</strong></p>
<p>YOU can make the world a better place by helping us start our Cultural Healing Arts Center on Maui.</p>

<p><strong>MAUIndia, A Heaven on Earth Sanctuary</strong></p>
<p>The ""MAU"" stands for Modern American Understanding, and the India speaks to our heritage and the ancient ways that have worked for centuries. We are Indian but raised American. We now have a deep understanding of America and have experienced the ugly underbelly of American Society. We are a fusion of the Understanding's of America and India and this place will be a sanctuary for anyone who needs healing, especially from the hardships of colonization and loss of culture. Culture is meant to bring us back to the Divine Beauty, Bliss, and Peace within. Mauindia will be a place where culture and the arts can be revived. Our Heaven on Earth Sanctuary will hold the space for retreats, events, and projects that help create a NEW system of peace and plenty for the planet! </p>

<p>The island of Maui is itself a Creative Center. It is the island of spiritual leaders, it is called the island of magic, and it is a place where the those with skills in the healing/creative arts are honored, valued, and supported. It has chital, (indian deer), indian birds, banyan trees, mango trees, and the transformational, healing, and tropical environment of India without the intensity and culture shock. It is the perfect place for those who have been through hardships in America and have suffered from western colonization to find their roots and culture and heal themselves. We call this Cultural Healing Arts center MAUIndia, a Heaven on Earth Sanctuary. It is a place that we feel guided by God to create. It is a place on Maui where we can create potent works of music and art, hold a sanctuary space for others to heal, and host lucrative and powerful spiritual/musical/artistic events that Uplift Consciousness and Bless the World. Eventually we plan on having children who we will pass on our sacred yogic lineage to and teach them the ancient ways that we have had to rediscover in ourselves.</p>

<p>Ideally we would love to offer our space and events for free to all- if we raise enough funds we can make our Sanctuary fully accessible for everyone!</p>

<p>It is Time and We are Ready. All we need is some start-up funding!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What we need to begin</strong></p>
<p><i>Some back-story to explain:</i></p>
<p>After spending the last 4 years in Ashland, Oregon doing constant yogic training, inner-work, inner-purification and self-healing, we were ready to go to Maui and Share our Gifts with the Community and the World. But the Universe was about to throw us some strength training in the form of several unexpected setbacks. First our ex-sponsors unexpectedly decided they did not have the funds to help us with the last steps like getting a charter jet- the only way to get our whole family to Maui abuse-free. Then we were given 12 days to leave by a prejudiced landlord even though we paid rent and did nothing wrong. So for the last 4 months we have been traveling in California with our cats, getting ripped off thousands of dollars by crooks pretending to have living situations. It is difficult for everyone around here, especially dark-skinned people to get a rental, and since we could not find one, we had to spend all our money on a hotel, where we are now on a tab. We finally found a real place to live here in Nevada City/Grass Valley, but as we are running on empty, we need at least $5000 to pay for our immediate basic needs, pay our hotel bill, and rent a real place where we can create more music, art, and income. But Maui is calling us home- we need to go there for our full success to blossom. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1542657496/p19ttxj9kq6nhq9d95yo.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We need to get our whole family (which at the moment is us and our cat children) to Maui immediately. Our cats cannot travel commercially without months of paperwork that we don't have nor believe in due to our practice of <strong>Ahimsa</strong>- non-harm. Our kitties have helped us heal our own trauma with their abundant unconditional love and one of the yogic practices in the Bhagavad Gita is to help and feed animals because they are sacred and it is our duty to steward the earth and its living things. When our kitties are traveling, in carriers, and around lots of people, they have a tendency to meow incessantly, hyperventilate, and rub their noses raw against their carriers, even when given relaxants. TSA does not treat pets like equals and are allowed to handle them however they want during security. All of this would be abusive to our sacred cats and against our Indian culture. So we cannot get to Maui with our whole family abuse-free unless we pay for a charter jet. With a charter jet, we can bypass the inhumane handling of commercial flying and get our whole family safely to Maui.  Then, depending on how much funding we have, we will rent, buy, or start a mortgage on a piece of land in Maui, where we can then start our cultural arts and healing center.</p>
<p>As Stewards of the earth, our animal children deserve protection from things most people would never do to a human child. Cats are the most watched thing on the internet and deserve respect and good treatment. We have a flight crew that can help us for about the standard rate for a flight to maui, as you have to use a large jet. Unfortunately, the cost is $56,000 but it is worth it to keep our family safe and plant a Pure seed of Righteousness and True Love and Family Values on the Earth. </p>
<p><br/>We found a few pieces of land on Maui that would work for this center. If we have <strong>at least $80,000</strong> we can move to Maui with our family and rent a beautiful place to offer our gifts while building up to buying. With this much we can get to Maui, get a rental, purchase all the instruments, get recording equipment, and electronic equipment for events. A beautiful rental on Maui and the tools to create would allow us to create income for our family, produce beneficial creations, and help others while working up to our highest goal. We would be so grateful just to finally be on Maui, which we can feel, is Home. We have been working hard for a long time to be Ready in ourselves to hold space on Maui, and finally we are. </p>
<p>Our Ultimate Vision that we have seen with the Creator is to steward a piece of land and run a our Cultural Healing Arts Center Non-profit for all who wish to come and Receive. </p>

<p>This immediately stabilizes our living situation from having thousands of dollars stolen from us and gives us food, water, and shelter for the immediate. We have already found a real place to rent where we can create do more music, art, and the funds to get to Maui.

<p>With just <i>$20,000</i><strong> </strong> we can rent in Nevada City/Grass Valley and ground enough to generate the funds needed to get to Maui, our niche in the world. We can generate income and bless the world by offering our yogic and artistic services live broadcasted events, sessions, musical recordings, videos, and more! But in order to focus on offering our services and creating art like a full album, we need to have our basic needs provided for and a real living space to offer our gifts from. We also need instruments and musical equipment for recording and events. With this level we will have to keep working to get to Maui, but our family will be taken care of and <i>YOU will get to hear and see lots of new music and art</i>  because we'll have the time, space and resources to produce it! </p>

We are Uma and Ketan and we have been living in Ashland, Oregon, and now Nevada City/Grass Valley, California. Our Destiny is to go to Maui and start a Cultural Healing Arts Center where we can hold sacred space for healing and create and share powerful, yogic music and art that changes the world for the better. Mother India flows through our blood but being raised in the U.S. caused us to lose our Rich Indian Heritage. We were not taught our yogic disciplines in childhood, we had to rediscover it all within ourselves. After many years of study, trainings, meditations, and self-healing, we have cleared our channels so Creator can Express freely through our Divine Vessels. We are Ready to uplift and inspire with our beautiful yogic arts, and change the world for the better!

I am an expert healer, singer, dancer, painter, and multi-media artist. I am an advanced yogi and I have spent 7 years fully focused on gaining skills in the healing arts and doing my inner work to recreate myself through yoga. I am a lineage keeper and my ancestry is linked to brahmins, ayurvedic healers, freedom fighters that marched with Gandhi, and true yoga. I was born and raised in Ann Arbor, Michigan to Americanized Indian parents.
I have a certification in massage therapy, neuro-linguistic programming/hypnotherapy, and theta healing (a modality of healing similar to certain ancient yogic practices that involve connecting to ones higher self for guidance and transformation). I have hosted spiritual and musical events with attendances ranging from 3 to 200 people.
I am an expert counselor and spiritual doctor and have the ability to heal all ailments. This is because  me and my partner have spent the last 3 years focused all day every day on our own inner healing/inner work. We have purified ourselves, we have purified the darkness in us to such an extent that we are able to be clear channels for the Divine. We are extremely advanced psychics, and the music and art that God brings through us is world-changing-ly beautiful and powerful. By spending the time cleaning our inner selves, we are now truly fit to be spiritual leaders and hold space for others by sharing our gifts of song, dance, art, music, stories and wisdom teachings. We are extremely qualified to run a healing center for the yogic arts that would host events, retreats, and art projects that would heal individuals and the collective and change the world for the better.
I co-created with 2 other women an amazing event called Singing Alive on Kauai, Hawaii. It was a 3 day festival of song that took immense planning and coordination. I also offered my music at the festival three years in a row. I can now easily create large musical/artistic/spiritual events for up to 50 people by myself and 100s of people with a team.

I've done Sound Healings on Kauai worth thousands of dollars and I've helped countless people with their health and spiritual growth by offering free healing sessions for many years.
I trained in ballet and modern dance for 10 years and am highly skilled as a choreographer.
Basically, I am an expert at any healing and artistic endeavor I put my mind to and All I need are the right resources and space to produce creations that are incredibly beautiful, poignant, and world-changing.
Events, Retreats, one-one-one healing sessions, classes, musical recordings, books, multi-media art, videos, and films are all within my area of expertise that will create positive world-changing results. All I need is to be set up with my own home and a few acres, where I can host these events and create the music and art that will change people's lives and bless the world immensely.

Ketan Anirban Thomas Strong

I was born in Calcutta, India and adopted by a European family and raised in the U.S. have 10 years of experience and am an expert in the areas of in meditation, yoga, pranayama, counseling, healing, music, gymnastics/dance. I am an extremely advanced psychic, yogic artist and spiritual doctor. I am also an expert in creating sacred spaces and sustainable gardens.

I am a trained psychic and raja yoga lineage keeper. I have been meditating for 20 years and have developed my own form of meditation called Waking Meditation which is essentially open-eyed introspection/psychological dream interpretation; perceiving the outer reality as a creation of one's inner world. Everything is a direct reflection of our inner self and any physical ailment stems from the mind. Healing can occur naturally with the correct Space.

 
 I am an expert spiritual doctor and can heal any ailment known to man using my precise psychic senses to diagnose and cure the mental-emotional root cause of any issue. I have been training my senses for over a decade and I traveled around the American mainland and Hawaii for many years helping others for free with their spiritual growth. 
Obviously our current system has not been working for everyone and has been causing destruction to our planet. Through deep meditation I was shown many new ways of living and discovered within my mind the Creator's blueprints for an entirely new system that is actually geared towards peace, prosperity, sustainability, and success for ALL. I am qualified to show others how we can use our creative abilities to live sustainably with the earth AND have all the luxuries of modern living. By healing the self of unnecessary desires, humans can live balanced lives with sustainable luxuries. Yoga is a life path which includes harmony with the Earth. In Maui, we can sustainably host and live-record music and art events on the land, sharing our inspiring creations and ways with the world and setting an example of the great potentials of man. Our Sacred Arts greatly uplift consciousness & impact the Soul, and with the magic of Maui and our Powerful Indian Heritage, we can change the whole world for the better.
*******All we need are people like YOU, who care about the Earth and who value Cultural Preservation, Music, the Arts, Yoga, Sustainability, and Healing!
YOU can make the world a better place by helping us start our Cultural Healing Arts Center on Maui.

 
MAUIndia, A Heaven on Earth Sanctuary
The ""MAU"" stands for Modern American Understanding, and the India speaks to our heritage and the ancient ways that have worked for centuries. We are Indian but raised American. We now have a deep understanding of America and have experienced the ugly underbelly of American Society. We are a fusion of the Understanding's of America and India and this place will be a sanctuary for anyone who needs healing, especially from the hardships of colonization and loss of culture. Culture is meant to bring us back to the Divine Beauty, Bliss, and Peace within. Mauindia will be a place where culture and the arts can be revived. Our Heaven on Earth Sanctuary will hold the space for retreats, events, and projects that help create a NEW system of peace and plenty for the planet! 

The island of Maui is itself a Creative Center. It is the island of spiritual leaders, it is called the island of magic, and it is a place where the those with skills in the healing/creative arts are honored, valued, and supported. It has chital, (indian deer), indian birds, banyan trees, mango trees, and the transformational, healing, and tropical environment of India without the intensity and culture shock. It is the perfect place for those who have been through hardships in America and have suffered from western colonization to find their roots and culture and heal themselves. We call this Cultural Healing Arts center MAUIndia, a Heaven on Earth Sanctuary. It is a place that we feel guided by God to create. It is a place on Maui where we can create potent works of music and art, hold a sanctuary space for others to heal, and host lucrative and powerful spiritual/musical/artistic events that Uplift Consciousness and Bless the World. Eventually we plan on having children who we will pass on our sacred yogic lineage to and teach them the ancient ways that we have had to rediscover in ourselves.

 
Ideally we would love to offer our space and events for free to all- if we raise enough funds we can make our Sanctuary fully accessible for everyone!
Please help All the Indian Gods and Goddesses help us to enact our Destiny.


It is Time and We are Ready. All we need is some start-up funding!
 
What we need to begin
Some back-story to explain:
After spending the last 4 years in Ashland, Oregon doing constant yogic training, inner-work, inner-purification and self-healing, we were ready to go to Maui and Share our Gifts with the Community and the World. But the Universe was about to throw us some strength training in the form of several unexpected setbacks. First our ex-sponsors unexpectedly decided they did not have the funds to help us with the last steps like getting a charter jet- the only way to get our whole family to Maui abuse-free. Then we were given 12 days to leave by a prejudiced landlord even though we paid rent and did nothing wrong. So for the last 4 months we have been traveling in California with our cats, getting ripped off thousands of dollars by crooks pretending to have living situations. It is difficult for everyone around here, especially dark-skinned people to get a rental, and since we could not find one, we had to spend all our money on a hotel, where we are now on a tab. We finally found a real place to live here in Nevada City/Grass Valley, but as we are running on empty, we need at least $5000 to pay for our immediate basic needs, pay our hotel bill, and rent a real place where we can create more music, art, and income. But Maui is calling us home- we need to go there for our full success to blossom. 

We need to get our whole family (which at the moment is us and our cat children) to Maui immediately. Our cats cannot travel commercially without months of paperwork that we don't have nor believe in due to our practice of Ahimsa- non-harm. Our kitties have helped us heal our own trauma with their abundant unconditional love and one of the yogic practices in the Bhagavad Gita is to help and feed animals because they are sacred and it is our duty to steward the earth and its living things. When our kitties are traveling, in carriers, and around lots of people, they have a tendency to meow incessantly, hyperventilate, and rub their noses raw against their carriers, even when given relaxants. TSA does not treat pets like equals and are allowed to handle them however they want during security. All of this would be abusive to our sacred cats and against our Indian culture. So we cannot get to Maui with our whole family abuse-free unless we pay for a charter jet. With a charter jet, we can bypass the inhumane handling of commercial flying and get our whole family safely to Maui.  Then, depending on how much funding we have, we will rent, buy, or start a mortgage on a piece of land in Maui, where we can then start our cultural arts and healing center.
As Stewards of the earth, our animal children deserve protection from things most people would never do to a human child. Cats are the most watched thing on the internet and deserve respect and good treatment. We have a flight crew that can help us for about the standard rate for a flight to maui, as you have to use a large jet. Unfortunately, the cost is $56,000 but it is worth it to keep our family safe and plant a Pure seed of Righteousness and True Love and Family Values on the Earth. 
We found a few pieces of land on Maui that would work for this center. If we have at least $80,000 we can move to Maui with our family and rent a beautiful place to offer our gifts while building up to buying. With this much we can get to Maui, get a rental, purchase all the instruments, get recording equipment, and electronic equipment for events. A beautiful rental on Maui and the tools to create would allow us to create income for our family, produce beneficial creations, and help others while working up to our highest goal. We would be so grateful just to finally be on Maui, which we can feel, is Home. We have been working hard for a long time to be Ready in ourselves to hold space on Maui, and finally we are. 
Our Ultimate Vision that we have seen with the Creator is to steward a piece of land and run a our Cultural Healing Arts Center Non-profit for all who wish to come and Receive.

This way we would have our own huge home and land to host larger events and serve more people. This way we would be able to cultivate our arts more freely without rental stipulations or risk of getting uprooted by landlords who want to sell or change renters. With this level of support we would have enough start-up to get to Maui, set up our grounded sanctuary at an ideal location and work up to making it completely non-profit!

The land in the link below has a lot of land and guest spaces so we can host larger events and retreats and serve more people.

All the money will go towards getting to Maui, purchasing land, creating, maintaining, and running our Sustainable Sanctuary. With this level of support we can actualize our Full Vision and offer our Gifts to the community and the world free to all. If you believe in this vision and have the ability to donate this much, you are welcome to do it through Indiegogo, or you can contact Uma at umamehta6@gmail.com to work out different arrangements. Thank you! 
 
ANY AMOUNT helps immensely and if you can't donate, then get the word out- send this to all your friends and tell them to share it too!  (you can use the Indiegogo share tools)
 
Thank you for supporting music, yoga, healing, culture, sustainability, goodness, & righteousness, and Thank you for helping us make the World a little more like Heaven on Earth.
 
Aloha
and 
Namaste

The album has been self-funded up to this point. My initial plan was to simply release it to Spotify, iTunes, etc. and be done with it.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Yeti Set Go formed in the all-consuming fires of Mt. Rainier as the last band of bumbling bards searching for the lost city of Tukwila. As their warriors and mages began to fall by the wayside one by one, supplies depleting, they knew what they had to do. They had to pop that rock and rock that pop! They gathered all their fairly moderate angst into one final spell, the spell that would finally unite all music into one unified theory of everything having to do with music. They joined hands, chanted some words in low Latin, and launched their spell into the air. </p>
<p>It came back as COVID, so that was bullshit. So much for their day jobs and whatnot. Time to release an album. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need all the money. We're shooting for a $5,000 goal to cover the costs of recording, producing, and distributing an album, as well as producing exclusive merchandise, hereafter known as ""merch"", and shooting and producing music videos (we pay our actors around these parts). </p>
<p>In return you get an album of great songwriting, amazing guitar riffs, and the most menacingly adequate percussion this side of the Ship Canal Bridge. We've got some fun perks, some perks everyone has come to expect from an independent band, plus some that your mother might not approve of.</p>
<p>If we don't reach our entire goal, the funds we manage to extract from our loyal fans will be prioritized according to the needs of the album. Suffice it to say, this album is going to get made. Whether anyone hears it depends on you guys! So are you Yeti for this?</p>
<p>Cuz we were born Yeti.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Music is meant to be completely awesome and epic. And if it can't be that, it should at least be fun. Yeti Set Go is the fun younger cousin of your favorite metal band. We don't sit at the kids' table because we can't rock with the grown ups, we sit at the kids' table because someone was dumb enough to think the Jell-O salad would be safe there. And it wasn't, not with us around. </p>
<p>We bring fun back to music. Because heartbreak is hilarious, cats are things that probably exist, and nobody gives a crap what your opinion is on Facebook. While some bands are searching for that epic anthem that a generation of kids will fall in love to, we're playing the anthems for the people who are probably pretty all right most of the time and that's totally fine. If you don't have fun at a Yeti Set Go concert, it's probably because we weren't playing one that night. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>In May we signed on to 8th Direction Records, a small, independent label started last year by Paul Abner and Eddy Fey from Tin Foil Top Hat. 8th Direction Records is running on an idea and a shoestring. The idea is a simple one: give the people who are always ignored a chance to have a voice. And we're doing that.</p>
<p>But the shoestring is real. We believe in the band, and we believe in our new label home, but these projects require funding. We're building a snowball, and every project just gets us that much more momentum. What we're asking for here isn't charity. We're asking honest people who care about the arts to fund a movement that will launch some of the most bitchin' sound stuff on Earth. </p>

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>Hello. I’m Theresa. How wonderful for you to join me on this journey! Throughout my life, I was surrounded by family and friends who encouraged me to sing my song… no matter what the circumstance. This campaign to fund my first album is a dream come true. Music has been my journey since childhood. It has sheltered me in sadness and lifted me in joy.</p>
<p>With your help, I can pay-it-forward and touch the hearts of thousands. I am grateful for your contribution. There are so many needs in the world. For you to consider me important enough to give your hard-earned money, touches the depth of my heart. I sincerely thank you. My true purpose is to be an inspiration and a force for good to help others see the best in themselves through the musical stories that I share… knowing that my legacy will be a part of every heart that I connect with and every life that I touch.  </p>

<h2><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Who Am I?</span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Hi! My name is Madison Levi - </span>Since I could speak, I've sung, and from the age of five, I was convinced that I would be a musician. I've spent the last decade of my life dedicated to that dream of living and breathing music, however, I was always playing someone else's songs.</p>
<p>Now, after completing a degree in composition and jazz voice, and performing along Australia's East Coast with numerous bands as a feature vocalist, I feel it's finally time to invest in my own creative vision. </p>
<p>For the last two years I've been writing and developing the songs for my EP 'Chrysalis'. Introspective and deeply honest, these songs reflect the way that we must fall apart in order to reconstruct ourselves again anew. They are an ode to our perfectly imperfect humanness, as well  as our strength; little reminders that it's okay to not be okay, and that there is always beauty in the midst of struggle.</p>
<p>So far this year I've managed to partially fulfil my vision by recording and releasing the feature single and music video to the EP <i>(watch it here: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TmB-ejDNPs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TmB-ejDNPs</a>)</i>. Being an independent artist, I love that I have had complete creative control over this project, but it also means that I've had no financial support from a label...<strong>that's why I'm now turning to my community </strong>and asking for your help in finishing this record.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">What Compels Me?</span></h2>
<p><strong>Music has always been my way of connection and catharsis.</strong> Through my own experience, I truly believe that artistic expression is vital to our existence. It allows us to connect with each other on so many levels, and in sharing our feelings and our stories, we allow each other the space to heal and to evolve on both a personal and societal level. <strong>It would be immensely humbling to know that my own music exists out in the world for someone else to connect to and heal with.</strong></p>
<p>I know that this is what I'm meant to be doing. I honestly cannot envision myself living a life that does not contribute creatively to the world. In giving to this campaign, you are not only helping me to complete and release a record, you are opening up more opportunities for me to realise a lifelong vision - a life of service to art and community.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h2>The Give &amp; Take Break Down</h2>
<p>I've estimated the total cost of the EP's production and release to be around $3700 - $4000.</p>
<p><strong>This is where your money is going:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Paying the musicians on the record for their studio time - $600 minimum</li>
<li>Recording with an expert sound engineer (2 x 8hr days of tracking) - $900</li>
<li>Mixing and post production - $800 minimum</li>
<li>Mastering - $300 minimum</li>
<li>Digital distribution - $50</li>
<li>Event room hire for EP Launch - $500</li>
<li>Poster printing / promotion for EP Launch - $200</li>
<li>Live Sound Engineer for EP Launch - $180</li>
<li>Paying the musicians to play at EP Launch - $400</li>
</ul>
<p>If I manage to exceed my campaign goal, and depending on how much by, I can use the extra funds to: hire a photographer/videographer for the Launch event to create promotional material, create a limited edition press of vinyl, create a professional website for my music/merch, or put the money toward the next project that I'm dreaming up for 2020 (a full length concept album)!</p>
<p><strong>What's in it for you?</strong></p>
<p>Everyone who donates <strong>$10 or more</strong> will receive a <strong>Digital Download</strong> of the completed EP 'Chrysalis'. You can also choose from:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>book of poetry </strong>written, illustrated and hand bound  by me. These are a limited edition with only two remaining to be claimed!</li>
<li>A Madison Levi <strong>T-Shirt</strong>. A very special collaboration with Melbourne artist Yolanta Rado who hand painted the artwork for print.</li>
<li>
<strong>Tickets to the 'Chrysalis' EP Launch</strong> held at Second Story Studios in December (More details TBA)</li>
<li>A private <strong>House Concert </strong>just for you and your friends! (Melbourne only)</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h2>The Impact, Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>The first challenge that I have had to overcome has been <strong>asking for help</strong>. I believe that our current social climate does not value the immense influence that music and other art-forms have within society. This lack of recognising the importance of creative work and its authenticity as a career serves to diminish the self worth of those who choose a creative path and leaves them without the viable resources to live and create. I've seen it and I've felt it. In choosing to value my own artistic contribution and ask for renumeration for my work, I feel as though I am shifting this toxic perception for myself and for other creatives who have value to share with the world.</p>
<p>Of course, there is always the risk that I might not reach my campaign goal. If this is the case, then I am committed to finding other avenues to fund this project - whether that be busking or taking on more hours at my day job - I know that I will complete this EP. If I hold a vision, everything I do is in service to that vision. If I throw myself off a ledge, it's because I trust that I can create the resources to catch myself.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>
<p>Every dollar put toward this project helps more than you can imagine! However, I understand that sometimes we just don't have the resources to give monetarily, even if our heart is in it.</p>
<p>The good news is that there are other ways you can help! If you are inspired by what I do, and would love to hear this recording finished, you can share this campaign with your friends and family, or if you're a fellow creative, you can get in touch with me and we can brain storm ways that we can collaborate - perhaps you'd like to donate your art/services as prizes for the campaign, or perhaps we could co-create an event to raise more funds?! The more community involvement the better. Music is about sharing an experience.</p>

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p><strong>My name is Gemma Laurence and I’m an indie folk singer/songwriter from Brunswick, Maine.</strong> I’ve been writing music for years now, but it was not until December of 2018 that I got the exciting opportunity to record my music professionally with mixer/engineer Jud Caswell at Frog Hollow Studio in Maine. Fast-forward six months and here we are! <strong>I am thrilled to announce that I will be releasing my debut album, Crooked Heart, on Friday August 16th 2019.</strong></p>
<p>Crooked Heart tells a story about the people and places left behind for new beginnings. There are old songs, new songs, and some songs you haven't heard yet! It's got foot-stomping banjo riffs, some killer cello solos, and a whole lot of heart. <strong>I cannot wait to share it with you – but I need your help in order to do that.</strong></p>
<p><strong>As a full-time student at Middlebury College and an independent artist</strong>, I don’t have the same level of funding as an artist signed by a record label. <strong>Making an album costs money</strong>, so, as many independent artists are doing nowadays, <strong>I am turning to you all to help me!</strong> I'm launching a crowdfunding campaign on IndieGoGo in order to cover production costs and make this album ready for you all to hear!</p>

<h3><strong><i>En Familia Project</i></strong></h3>
<p>Alex Llumiquinga (director or the Andean musical group “Chayag,” <a href=""http://www.andeanmusic.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.andeanmusic.org</a>) </p>
<p> I was born in the country of Ecuador. Together with my family we interpret music and dance from the Andes (Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Colombia and a little bit of Irish music too) as well our own original tunes. During the last 5 years we have been performing around the state of Oregon-US, in schools, libraries, festivals and community events.</p>
<p>Our next project is going to take place in Ecuador during the 2019-20 school year.  Our goal is to record and produce a traditional music album as a family with the collaboration of friends who are local musicians in Ecuador.  During our staying, we will dedicate our time to acquire more knowledge in traditional music, rhythms, traditional dances and culture. This experience will strengthen our ability to serve as a bridge between cultures, which is the passion that most motivates us to continue making and sharing our music as a family. </p>
<p>Upon our return to the States, we wish to share the fruits of our labor by presenting this project to you all and the community. </p>
<p>We hope with your contribution we will be able to reach our financial goal and make this project a reality.</p>
<p>¡Muchas gracias!</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<p><i><strong>The proposal</strong></i><br/><br/>The project is titled En Familia. The goal of this project is to raise $ 6000, with which we will cover album recording, mastering, guest artists fees, short video clip and other expenses.<br/><br/>The project will be carried out in Ecuador during a 9-month period (August/2019-July/2020).</p>
<p>Before recording the album we will spend time visiting indigenous communities, studying traditional rhythms, arranging, composing songs and coordinating ideas with our local musician friends. After that period we will start recording traditional songs of our authorship and from the wide ecuadorian repertoire.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of this album we will record a video clip featuring the beauty of the ecuadorian landscape and the wonderful people. We know that with our music we have managed to break the barrier of borders. We believe that in difficult times music can unite us and create more understanding among all people and members of the community and inspire future generations to use the power of music to unite as all.</p>

Alex Llumiquinga (director or the Andean musical group “Chayag,” www.andeanmusic.org) 
 I was born in the country of Ecuador. Together with my family we interpret music and dance from the Andes (Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Colombia and a little bit of Irish music too) as well our own original tunes. During the last 5 years we have been performing around the state of Oregon-US, in schools, libraries, festivals and community events.
Our next project is going to take place in Ecuador during the 2019-20 school year.  Our goal is to record and produce a traditional music album as a family with the collaboration of friends who are local musicians in Ecuador.  During our staying, we will dedicate our time to acquire more knowledge in traditional music, rhythms, traditional dances and culture. This experience will strengthen our ability to serve as a bridge between cultures, which is the passion that most motivates us to continue making and sharing our music as a family. 
Upon our return to the States, we wish to share the fruits of our labor by presenting this project to you all and the community. 
We hope with your contribution we will be able to reach our financial goal and make this project a reality.
¡Muchas gracias!

 
The proposalThe project is titled En Familia. The goal of this project is to raise $ 6000, with which we will cover album recording, mastering, guest artists fees, short video clip and other expenses.The project will be carried out in Ecuador during a 9-month period (August/2019-July/2020).
Before recording the album we will spend time visiting indigenous communities, studying traditional rhythms, arranging, composing songs and coordinating ideas with our local musician friends. After that period we will start recording traditional songs of our authorship and from the wide ecuadorian repertoire.
At the conclusion of this album we will record a video clip featuring the beauty of the ecuadorian landscape and the wonderful people. We know that with our music we have managed to break the barrier of borders. We believe that in difficult times music can unite us and create more understanding among all people and members of the community and inspire future generations to use the power of music to unite as all.

<h3>Late July &amp; The Debut LP</h3>
<p>Join me as I put together my debut LP featuring 10-12 original songs full of rich orchestral arrangements mixed with indie pop glow. </p>
<p>Produced by Sasha Szlafarski and featuring Devin Hoare (Trumpet) and Fred Yurichuk (Bass) you can expect a journey through a sonic whirlwind of love, loss and rebirth from the witchiest redhead around. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>There are many costly moving parts that are integral to the completion of the album that take place over a period of many months. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tracking ($3,500)</li>
<li>Mixing ($3,500)</li>
<li>Mastering ($2,000)</li>
<li>Vinyl Pressing ($4,000)</li>
<li>Merchandise ($2,000)</li>
<li>Album Art Design ($300)</li>
<li>Press/Promotion ($2,000)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many ways to support the campaign and many ways in which we will be giving back. Check out the Perks for more details. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Phase 1 - Tracking and Mixing</h3>
<p>With the core the songs written, the next step is working out Tracking, the actual recording process. This includes any and all instrumental tones and sonic textures that will be featured on the album. Vocals, Keys, Horns, Drums, Bass, Guitar, etc.</p>
<p>Once Tracking has been completed, we move on to the Mixing stages. This is where the arrangements get sculpted, tweaked and coloured. It's where the vibe finds life and where the overall sound of the album will take shape.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Phase 2 - Mastering and Vinyl Pressing</h3>
<p>Mastering is a crucial stage in the production of any album. This is where the songs, now tracked and mixed, go into the hands of a Mastering Engineer whose job it is to prepare the songs in such a way that they will sound their best on any and all listening platforms - your Hi Fi System, your car stereo, your phone speakers, your earbuds etc. Just because the songs sound great on one system doesn't mean it will sound great on any/all system. The Mastering Engineer uses highly dedicated equipment to make the perfect adjustments to guarantee perfect sonic translation, and also does so in a way that the songs will have a ""unified"" sound when listening through the Album.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Once Mastering is complete, the Album goes physical. The Masters are sent off to a Vinyl Pressing Facility where they create test cuts to make sure there isn't anything in glaring in the songs that could impact their performance on a vinyl record player. Quite often there may be a certain tone that needs to be revised in a song in order to prevent this from happening. Sometimes this can be fixed in a Mastering Revision, but sometimes a song needs to go all the way back to the Mixing stage to get it just right.</p>
<p>Once the Masters have been tested at the pressing facility and have been approved, the album goes to the mass production stage, where each individual record will formed, cut, prepared and packaged by hand. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Phase 3 - Final Preparations</h3>
<p>Once mass production of the vinyl is underway, the final items need to be prepared for the end of the campaign. This includes purchasing and printing all the merchandise and getting it packed for shipping. During this stage there will also be a heavy promotional campaign to get as much buzz for the album going as possible. </p>
<p>Once the merchandising and vinyl packaging is complete, the album will be released and the perk packages will be sent into the world. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Many of you will know me from my time on X Factor in The UK in 2016 or mabye from Facebook/YouTube or my TV performances in Northern Ireland  &amp; over the years some will have gotten to know me since. I have worked super hard to establish myself over the last 9 years &amp; think I have done a good job so far!</p>
<p>The Music business has changed so much over the last years &amp; especially since Covid took hold. Now more than ever before, it is so hard to get your name and music out there. CD stores have almost gone out of business and most people use Spotify or Amazon to stream their favourite music for free. Making Albums have become so costly &amp; they are almost impossible to get together currently with the financial difficulties performers are facing.. So in order to record albums for the fan base you have, you either need a big label behind you, or a lot of money! Currently both those options are out the window &amp; I am not that person with the label or the money to splash on my next Album, now more than ever it has become almost impossible to get a new Album out there. A lot of my fans have asked me to set up a ""Go Fund Me"" so they can support the production of an Album.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed making my last Album “A New Dawn” which went to #1 on the iTunes World Music Chart &amp; the 2 sold out concerts that followed that release in The City Hotel &amp; The Millennium Forum in #Derry. During lock down I have been songwriting A LOT &amp; have a brand new Original Album written. I am now ready to record &amp; I want this Album to be the best &amp; most professional project I have worked on yet! </p>
<p>You have all been  asking me to release a new Album over the last few months, but I'm not sure everyone realises how hard it is to do it. I'm  throwing it out there &amp; going for it against the odds in this current climate &amp; would love to do a new album of songs that represent me at this time in my life. I've had a lot of ups and downs over the last 9 years but from my experience perseverance &amp; determination against the odds always works out! I feel at tip form vocally and ready to move this forward with my original material. The original album I have in mind and hope to raise funds for will be the best project I have worked on yet &amp; this album will be a reflection of me as an artist  and I hope it will come to life with your help. Just to make people aware, £30,000 is like a pie in the sky world class Album. Realistically I know I will probably never reach this target in 60 days. A few thousand pound will put together a top class Album.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So, here’s where your money will go:</p>
<p>If we raise £30,000 I can properly record the album I'm dreaming of:</p>
<p>£ 10,000   Production (musician/producers/choir/travel fees)</p>
<p>£ 4,000    Licensing/publishing costs</p>
<p>£ 3,000    Mixing and Mastering</p>
<p>£ 3,000    Physical Production (CD + Art)</p>
<p>£ 5,000    Marketing and advertising</p>
<p>£ 5,000    Music videos for the Album plus Website </p>
<p>If we raise beyond the £30,000 I can hire PR &amp; pluggers to get my music to radio stations and into the hands of the “right people”  and help spread the word about my album with more Marketing and Advertising I would also be looking to set up a brand new website to help move me forward professionally. Again 30,000 is a crazy amount and is only a bench mark for the best possible outcome.</p>
<p>Hopefully this will be the beginning of a brand new chapter in my career &amp; quoting one of my songs, my opportunity to “Move On” with my career! My intention is also to start touring with my music once Covid disappears for good! As far and wide as I can based on all your fan feedback about wanting to hear me in your town or city.  I have some great plans and ideas, but none of these can be realised without you. Music like mine needs your support. To be honest I think I took my gigging for granted before lockdown &amp; the financial struggle over lockdown has really hammered home how good I had it before Covid took hold. I could release more music and create more music videos etc because I had the finance to be able.  if we raise enough through this project, I will record as many tracks as possible on this new Album. The type of Album I make will be down to you! Please know that I am &amp; will be grateful for any donation, big or small!</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
</div><div>
<p>Albums like mine are hard to make by independent artists due to the huge costs. So therefore many artists are fading away &amp; not moving forward due to the lack of support &amp; finances. With the following I have and their generosity, I have continued to keep myself a float to an extent over the lockdown period due to tipping gigs. Without albums, the interest fades, and sadly, so does an artists career. </p>
<p>I will be proud to say that everyone involved on this album will be Irish and from similar backgrounds in music to me. Many are some of the best in the business including the amazing Eamonn Karran. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Everyone values transparency. </p>
<p>With any production there are always many challenges and risks. One of the main challenges I will face will be getting the right team together for the Album &amp; getting on board some well established producers. Thankfully so far so have been lucky in that all I have approached so far to work with me have been happy to do so &amp; in this Album I will be reaching out to some in the business who are at the top top level. I already have a fantastic producer in Eamonn Karran &amp; subject to funds, hopefully I can bring in a few people to bring the best out in my vocal.  So the creative side of this Album &amp; getting the right people together will be subject to funds.</p>
<p>Another major challenge is the time of release. I hope to be able to release this As soon as possible, hopefully early 2021. This would be a very quick turnaround.</p>
<p>The risks are  very high when making an album. My last Album “A New Dawn” &amp; shows  I put my own money into the album recordings and marketing although all of these have helped me along the way of my career, there has been financial loss on these projects. Sadly, that's is how it is and at the beginning you need to loss to gain eventually in your career. Big record labels &amp; managements don't like loss but for people like me as an  independent artists it is part &amp; parcel.. I have been so positive and determined to chase my dream.</p>
<p>The risk as always is that people won't buy the album, or they won't like it. Or this project to raise funds won’t be supported. But that's is the risk I am willing to take we all take! I will give this my best stab!</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>I understand  how tough times are financially. More than ever now! I understand that asking for help financially from others to fulfil my ambitions is hard for some to understand.. So with that in mind, if you can help, be guaranteed that I am so  grateful and thankful for your support &amp; generosity.</p>
<p>If you can’t help  financially but would like to still help - You can! Getting the word out and sharing my links! Whether through, social media or word of mouth</p>
<p>Please feel free to use the Indiegogo share tools!</p>
<p>All help is welcomed. The more I raise, the more I can do! </p>

If we raise beyond the £30,000 I can hire PR & pluggers to get my music to radio stations and into the hands of the “right people”  and help spread the word about my album with more Marketing and Advertising I would also be looking to set up a brand new website to help move me forward professionally. Again 30,000 is a crazy amount and is only a bench mark for the best possible outcome.
Hopefully this will be the beginning of a brand new chapter in my career & quoting one of my songs, my opportunity to “Move On” with my career! My intention is also to start touring with my music once Covid disappears for good! As far and wide as I can based on all your fan feedback about wanting to hear me in your town or city.  I have some great plans and ideas, but none of these can be realised without you. Music like mine needs your support. To be honest I think I took my gigging for granted before lockdown & the financial struggle over lockdown has really hammered home how good I had it before Covid took hold. I could release more music and create more music videos etc because I had the finance to be able.  if we raise enough through this project, I will record as many tracks as possible on this new Album. The type of Album I make will be down to you! Please know that I am & will be grateful for any donation, big or small!
The Impact

Albums like mine are hard to make by independent artists due to the huge costs. So therefore many artists are fading away & not moving forward due to the lack of support & finances. With the following I have and their generosity, I have continued to keep myself a float to an extent over the lockdown period due to tipping gigs. Without albums, the interest fades, and sadly, so does an artists career. 
I will be proud to say that everyone involved on this album will be Irish and from similar backgrounds in music to me. Many are some of the best in the business including the amazing Eamonn Karran. 

Risks & Challenges
Everyone values transparency. 
With any production there are always many challenges and risks. One of the main challenges I will face will be getting the right team together for the Album & getting on board some well established producers. Thankfully so far so have been lucky in that all I have approached so far to work with me have been happy to do so & in this Album I will be reaching out to some in the business who are at the top top level. I already have a fantastic producer in Eamonn Karran & subject to funds, hopefully I can bring in a few people to bring the best out in my vocal.  So the creative side of this Album & getting the right people together will be subject to funds.
Another major challenge is the time of release. I hope to be able to release this As soon as possible, hopefully early 2021. This would be a very quick turnaround.
The risks are  very high when making an album. My last Album “A New Dawn” & shows  I put my own money into the album recordings and marketing although all of these have helped me along the way of my career, there has been financial loss on these projects. Sadly, that's is how it is and at the beginning you need to loss to gain eventually in your career. Big record labels & managements don't like loss but for people like me as an  independent artists it is part & parcel.. I have been so positive and determined to chase my dream.
The risk as always is that people won't buy the album, or they won't like it. Or this project to raise funds won’t be supported. But that's is the risk I am willing to take we all take! I will give this my best stab!
