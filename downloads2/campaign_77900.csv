<h2>Barefoot inspired running shoes and training clinics brought to your town, event, or gym.</h2>
<h1>What Good Feels Like</h1>
<p>Born to Run was started for one simple reason: To feel good. But more specifically to feel good while running, walking, and standing. We sell barefoot inspired footwear and teach proper running technique so that you can feel good.</p>

<br/><p></p>
<h3>From Retail Store to Mobile Store</h3>
<p>Three years ago I called Barefoot Ted (from the best selling book <i>Born to Run</i>) and told him that I wanted to spread the joy of barefoot inspired running by opening a retail and web store that specialized in selling barefoot inspired shoes and educating people on proper running form. Barefoot Ted said, ""Dude, let's do it. Let's call it Born to Run."" </p>
<p>I was amazed at how many people loved our store and our purpose, but I constantly have customers from out of town tell me that they wish they had a store like this near them. So we decided that instead of making you wait for us to put a store in your town, we would take our store on the road and bring the experience to you.</p>
<p></p>

<br/><p></p>
<h3>What is the Born to Run Mobile Store?</h3>
<p>Simply enough, it's a Born to Run retail store that is mobile. We pack a trailer full of shoes, apparel, accessories, and know-how and we head out on the road to towns, cities, events, and CrossFit gyms across the U.S. (and perhaps Canada too), to bring our retail experience to you.</p>
<p></p>

<br/><p></p>
<h3>Mobile Store Design</h3>
<p>With your help through generous pledges, we will purchase a large trailer, which we will outfit with a retail display wall hidden behind two large awnings. We will then fill the trailer with all your favorite barefoot inspired footwear such as New Balance Minimus, Altra Zero Drop, Vibram FiveFingers, Luna Sandals, Skora, Merrell, Vivobarefoot, Inov-8, and Reebok CrossFit. We will also stock up on great apparel, accessories, and our expert know-how as we hit the road and bring our barefoot inspired footwear and running clinics to you.</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Fundraising Goals</h3>
<p>The minimum we need to buy and customize the trailer is $10,000, but for every $20,000 we raise, we will buy and customize another mobile store trailer and tow vehicle. More mobile stores mean that we can be in more places, teaching more running clinics, and bringing the Born to Run experience to more of you more of the time. So help us raise $40,000, $60,000, or $80,000 so that we can spread the joy of barefoot inspired running across the nation!</p>

<p>On November 10, 2013, the coastal
districts of the North Eastern Somalia of Puntland were devastated by the tropical cyclone
that hit the three major districts of Dangorayo, Eyl and Bandarbayla and caused
heavy rainfall and floods. The Puntland state government of Somalia declared
this a natural disaster on November 11, 2013. Within the hours following the
storm, 157 persons and 300,000 camels, goats and sheep died as a result of the
steep decline in temperature combined with heavy rains. Animals are the major
source of livelihood for the affected communities.</p>
<p>The urgent response needed includes:
food items, medical supplies, water trucking, shelter, non-food items (NFI) and
livelihood support, primarily in the form of eventual restocking, replacement
of lost fishing gear and rapid access to cash through either cash-for-work
programs or income generation opportunities. Outbreaks of infectious diseases,
including malaria and acute watery diarrhea, have been observed, and cases of
moderate malnutrition are quite common in the area due to limited access to food.
Major water sources, including boreholes and water basins, collapsed and access
to safe and clean water is a challenge. Affected communities are also
struggling with the dead bodies of their animals. <br/></p><p>
</p><p><b>Community-led Total Sanitation</b> (CLTS) is a team of community development activists that received seed funding from the Resolution Project to improve the hygiene and sanitation behavior of the displaced people in Puntland state of Somalia.</p>
<b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b><p></p><b></b><p></p><h3></h3><p></p>
<p>Community-led Total Sanitation
team has a fundraising target of USD 7,000 to address the health,
sanitation and medical issues to urgently assist the affected communities and
prevent further deterioration of the health conditions of the orphaned children.
</p>
<p>Based on the urgent needs on the
ground, this amount will be used as follows:</p>
<ul>

On November 10, 2013, the coastal
districts of the North Eastern Somalia of Puntland were devastated by the tropical cyclone
that hit the three major districts of Dangorayo, Eyl and Bandarbayla and caused
heavy rainfall and floods. The Puntland state government of Somalia declared
this a natural disaster on November 11, 2013. Within the hours following the
storm, 157 persons and 300,000 camels, goats and sheep died as a result of the
steep decline in temperature combined with heavy rains. Animals are the major
source of livelihood for the affected communities.
The urgent response needed includes:
food items, medical supplies, water trucking, shelter, non-food items (NFI) and
livelihood support, primarily in the form of eventual restocking, replacement
of lost fishing gear and rapid access to cash through either cash-for-work
programs or income generation opportunities. Outbreaks of infectious diseases,
including malaria and acute watery diarrhea, have been observed, and cases of
moderate malnutrition are quite common in the area due to limited access to food.
Major water sources, including boreholes and water basins, collapsed and access
to safe and clean water is a challenge. Affected communities are also
struggling with the dead bodies of their animals. 
Community-led Total Sanitation (CLTS) is a team of community development activists that received seed funding from the Resolution Project to improve the hygiene and sanitation behavior of the displaced people in Puntland state of Somalia.
What We Need & What You Get
Community-led Total Sanitation
team has a fundraising target of USD 7,000 to address the health,
sanitation and medical issues to urgently assist the affected communities and
prevent further deterioration of the health conditions of the orphaned children.

Based on the urgent needs on the
ground, this amount will be used as follows:

USD 3,000 buys 250 goats for 50 families. Each family will receive 5 goats to generate daily income from the milk and butter of the goats to revitalize their livelihood sources. 

USD 2,000 buys essential drugs and 20 dignity kits to enhance the access of
     the communities to basic health care services including daily treatment of
     infectious diseases, health education, and child immunization and
     assisting the safe delivery of pregnant women.

USD 1,000 buys 100 sanitary kits and 300 water purification tablets such as aqua tabs for 100 households.
USD 1,000 buys 40 wheelbarrows for garbage disposal and environmental cleaning to avoid the spread of infectious diseases and diarrhea outbreaks. 
The Impact
With your support, our campaign will  improve the living conditions of the affected communities through income generation activities. Our campaign will protect 3,840 persons from the outbreak of infectious diseases and improve their hygiene and sanitation behaviors. The campaign will improve access of the communities to clean and safe water and will distribute hygiene kits. So far, with the support of
community cash contributions and the technical support of the Somalia health
cluster and food security and livelihood clusters, the CLTS team mobilized USD
13,000 at a very early stage for affected communities to distribute dry food
supplies including biscuits, milk powder and dates and provision of emergency
medical assistance. The CLTS team assisted a total number of 3,840 persons most
affected by the catastrophe. Given the huge number of households affected by
the cyclone with the limited resources in place, the CLTS team could not
maintain the distribution of services, and needs your help to continue our
work.

<h3>Who We Are &amp; What We're Brewing</h3> <p><b><u>The Bramble Collective</u></b> is a group of four Ithaca, NY-based herbalists with a dream to bring <b>accessible, sustainable medicine</b> to our community. With over 45  years of herbal training and services combined, we are coming together to offer our skills, passion and innovation to bring an <b>herbal hub</b> to downtown Ithaca on <b>Press Bay Alley</b>. This herbal hub will act as a retail store for bulk herbs, medicine-making supplies, local herbal products, and a community space for consultations, workshops, classes and events to be held by local practitioners, teachers, and wildcrafters. We believe that a sustainable and healthy community begins with access to sustainable medicine. This is why we are creating this space to host a <b>low-cost herbal clinic</b> where community members can access consultations with local herbalists and receive reduced-cost herbal remedies.</p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>How YOU can help us bring this dream to life!</h3> <p>As a collective we are investing our own time, money and resources into this endeavor, but we can't do it on our own. <b>Bramble is rooted in community: herbs from community farms, knowledge from community herbalists, and support from community members.</b> This is why we are seeking your support to help us enrich our community by keeping it local and putting money back into the pockets of our neighbors. Your donations will help us:</p>
<ul>
<li>pay local craftsmen to help us build the infrastructure of our space</li>
<li>stock our shelves with as many locally-sourced and organic herbs as possible</li>
<li>cover some of the costs to create promotional materials for the classes, workshops and events hosted by community members</li>
</ul>
<div>When you donate you'll have the opportunity to receive various prizes from local community members.

<div>We strongly believe in the collective efforts of a community and our ability to create sustainable change together. If you can't support us today financially, <b>you can still support our project by sharing this campaign</b> with your friends, families and even other communities who may want to create a community herbal hub in their area.</div>
</div><div> <p><br/></p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>What if we don't raise enough money?</h3>
<p>The Bramble Collective is committed to making this dream a reality, but our ability to offer a low-cost clinic and locally-sourced herbs may be compromised. We want to keep our resources local by applying the financial support of our friends and neighbors directly to our cause. We are creating this space for our community, not the banks, but if we don't raise enough money we will have to seek financial support through multiple loans. </p>
<p><i>However</i>, if we surpass our goal, we will be able to offer a larger variety of locally sourced herbs (therefore further supporting our local farmers and herbalists) and begin to subsidize the costs of running a low-cost clinic!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Want to become more involved with Bramble?</h3>
<div>The Bramble Collective is created for the community and by the community. We want Bramble to represent what can happen when community members come together to share their skills, visions and resources.

  What if we don't raise enough money?
The Bramble Collective is committed to making this dream a reality, but our ability to offer a low-cost clinic and locally-sourced herbs may be compromised. We want to keep our resources local by applying the financial support of our friends and neighbors directly to our cause. We are creating this space for our community, not the banks, but if we don't raise enough money we will have to seek financial support through multiple loans. 
However, if we surpass our goal, we will be able to offer a larger variety of locally sourced herbs (therefore further supporting our local farmers and herbalists) and begin to subsidize the costs of running a low-cost clinic!


  Want to become more involved with Bramble?
The Bramble Collective is created for the community and by the community. We want Bramble to represent what can happen when community members come together to share their skills, visions and resources. If you are a local herbal enthusiast, farmer, herbalist or wellness practitioner and you want to become more involved in the collective you can become a ""friend"" of Bramble. Being a friend  is an on-going relationship that offers a variety of perks with a financial commitment that says you believe in what Bramble has to offer this community.

Last year I was very blessed to go on my first mission trip to Africa and this year, I feel called to go again. The organization that I go on these trips with is called iPourlife. The trip is in late May and so far I have raised $1,600 by selling pocket tee shirts that I make, saving tips from work and money I receive from babysitting. That leaves me with $1,400 to raise!

Anandwan was founded to give individuals with leprosy and disabilities a chance to live their lives to the fullest and thrive in society. Many of the people we had met were forced to leave their homes and families and had no other place to go. By providing them with healthcare, education, and vocational training, Anandwan serves to reintegrate many of these individuals back into the societies from which they once fled. While Anandwan has made great strides against the inequalities faced by its residents, there are still a lot of barriers they face. Goals & IncentivesThe projects we have planned for our upcoming trip include:
Developing a curriculum of professionalism workshops that incorporate critical thinking/reasoning, interview and resume skills, and computer skills such as email and web search. 
Donating a Xerox machine to the local school to allow teachers to make copies of worksheets and class materials.
Acquiring a braille printer so that students at the school for the blind can have alternate ways of learning class material.
Raising funds to buy functional hearing aids for hard-of-hearing students in the school for the deaf.
Establishing an English Language Learning Center to enable students to compete in an increasingly competitive and global job market.

<p><b>About GenSexNYC:</b><br/></p>
<br/><p>GenSexNYC is an anti-oppression sexuality workshop for all gender identities.  We work to build a safer, braver community of participants in the New York City area to share and explore our experiences of identity.</p>
<br/><p><b>Help us make this happen!</b></p>
<br/><p>This fall, we will have three workshop sections in the NYC area. To cover the cost of space, materials, and our online presence for the season, we need to raise $3,000. All our organizers and facilitators volunteer their time and are unpaid. 100% of your donations will go towards the cost of running the workshop. </p>
<br/><p>We are committed to making the workshop available to all--regardless of their ability to pay. Participant fees are by donation and go towards the cost of workshop materials. </p>
<br/><p>By helping to make GenSexNYC a reality, you will support a movement of empowerment, allyship, community, and learning in New York City. We are so excited about bringing this workshop series into the NYC community.</p>
<br/><p><b>Other Ways you can help: </b></p>
<br/><p>Share this fundraising link! Are you a past participant of a FemSex or GenSex workshop in another city? Send it to your old section with a hello and an update! Send it to your siblings, friends, co workers, parents, and mentors! Let them know what you got out of the workshop and why you think it's important to hold in communities everywhere.  </p>
<br/><p><b>A little more about us: </b></p>
<p>GenSexNYC is a volunteer-organized, multi-week discussion- and activity-based workshop.  At weekly facilitated meetings, participants explore different facets of identity and how they intersect:  gender, sexuality and pleasure, race and ethnicity, communication and consent, class, health and ability, and others.  Each topic is discussed in the framework of privilege and oppression.  Personal narratives can be spoken or expressed creatively, and meetings also include a variety of collaborative group activities.  While facilitators provide readings and other educational resources, participants are also welcome and encouraged to share new or additional resources.</p>
<p>By recounting and listening, we challenge our assumptions and learn from our peers as a community, setting aside judgment to validate each others’ ideas and experiences.  GenSexNYC becomes a safer space by encouraging mutual acceptance, and by extension a braver platform for sharing vulnerable thoughts and stories.</p>

</p><h3>Short Summary.</h3>
<p>Enrique is on a team of workers remodeling our kitchen.  He is always on time, does excellent work, and cleans up the work area at the end of every day.  I would describe him as a hard worker, extreamly competent, quiet and polite.  Enrique has been working five days a week at my house and told me he works Saturdays and Sundays also, seven days a week, because he needs the income.  </p>
<p>He bought his used red truck less than a year ago and carried all his tools in the attached and locked tool boxes in the truck bed.  This truck was not only his valued transportation but the source of his livelihood.</p>
<p>Last Wednesday, he and his brother Flavio, who is also working on the remodel, were going back and forth from the truck to my kitchen with various tools during their workday.  On one return to the truck, between 12:30 and 1 p.m., the truck disappeared.  Enrique has the keys in his pocket and assumes the truck was hot wired.  They called the police and a report was made, but to date, the truck has not been found.  Enrique carried liability car insurance only, so his truck is not covered under his policy.</p>
<p>I am launching this campaign because I would like to help Enrique with funds to replace his truck. A number of people in our neighborhood also feel badly that this happened on our block and expressed an interest in contributing.  I know a number of of our friends and aquaintances have used the same contractor and thus Enrique may well have worked on their houses too.  This campaign will allow him to raise funds from his own friends and family as well.  </p>
<p>
</p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The amount of this campaign is the exact amount Enrique paid for his truck about 8 months ago.  Our family is contributing to this campaign and we hope you will too.  If we don't reach our goal, we will give Enrique everything we have raised.  If we reach our goal before the 3-month deadline, we will stop this campaign as soon as our goal is reached.</p>
<p>Anyone who contributes to this campaign will be invited to an open-house, with food and drink, once our kitchen is remodeled!</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By contributing to this campaign, you are sending the message that we are all responsible for each other and the kind of world or neighborhood we want to live in.  We are helping someone in need, doing a kind deed.  </p>
<p>This is also a teachable moment as we have discussed this unjustice with our children and they are going to have a lemonade stand and other fundraisers to contribute to this campaign.  </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please send this campaign information to others (use the Indiegogo share tools).  You could also send a note and I will get it to Enrique.   </p>

<p>My name is Trent Jones. I am 20 years old. I am the founder and owner of T3 Bat Company. We are a baseball bat company and brand based out of Georgia. </p>
<p>After playing baseball for 17 years, I decided I would really love to continue to be around the game after I graduate college. I have also coincidentally been infatuated with business since the earliest days of my youth which led to my choosing of a business major in college. So of course, this sparked the idea for my own baseball brand. Since then, this spark has ignited a fire that continues to be the heart of T3 Bat Company.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Why do we need funding?</h3> <p>Well, thank you for asking.</p>
<p></p>
<p>T3 Bat Company is currently supplying high-quality handcrafted wood baseball bats to players from all parts of Georgia and even a variety of other states through our social media and website. We are currently struggling intensely to make bats as quickly as we sell them due to poor equipment. </p>
<p>From my experience selling T3 bats, it has become apparent to me that our customers are also interested in purchasing shirts, hats, etc. That is why I would also like to expand in the near future to selling apparel. Being a college baseball player, I not only know what baseball players would purchase and wear, but I also have a great opportunity to get feedback directly from the target market. </p>
<p>In addition to this, custom bat making is one of our top selling products. And at our current size, we have not been able to purchase a wood engraving laser capable of adding custom text onto our bats. This would, without question, have a serious impact on sales.</p>
<p>So specifically, here is what all funds will go to:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>More durable wood-working Tools</li>
<li>Higher Quality Wood Lathe</li>
<li>T3 Apparel Line</li>

<h3>The Future of T3 Bat Company</h3>
<p>Of course, T3 Bat Company is much more than just a business. As T3 grows into a more widely recognized baseball brand, I would like to promote positive messages to players, specifically the youth, across the country through the game. Whether it be the importance of school, sportsmanship, helping others, or anything else we are called to do. </p>
<p>We would reward select players we see playing the game with good sportsmanship and volunteering in their community, as well as academic scholarships for players who work hard in school as well as on the field. </p>
<p>This is one of the many ways T3 Bat Company is different than any other baseball brand. Not only will we supply the highest quality baseball equipment and apparel, but we will also work hard to encourage positive attributes in players and reward them when we witness these qualities at work.</p>

THE EARTH WAS HERE LONG BEFORE MAN AND WILL BE HERE LONG AFTER.Hello and thank you viewing our fundraising campaign. Allow me to introduce myself to those who do not know me. I am Marc Mills, an American Farmer in Guthrie, Oklahoma. I have an amazing passion for growing, cooking and eating organic food. Food ranging from salad greens to tomatoes and peppers, to organic grass fed meats. Not only enough to feed my friends and family, but enough to feed a whole community.Our farm is nestled in the cottonwood creek valley, just southwest of Guthrie Oklahoma and approximately 10 miles north of Edmond, Oklahoma. The meandering Cottonwood creek runs through the east, south and north sides of our farm giving us approximately a mile of water front. We are blessed with an abundance of bottomland flood plane which keeps our soils deep and rich and our pastures support life.We currently raise organic hay and small vegetable crops and pasture raised beef, chicken & pork. When we complete the funding we will diversify our farm in amazing ways by completing a steel building, and converting an old barn to a aquaponics greenhouse where we will have fresh green vegetables year round.Our vision of the plan for the steel building, when complete, is to process tree nuts, from our own organic pecan and black walnut groves, as well as being available for others to process their and market their tree nuts in an efficient affordable manner.

The focus now is to save as any lives as possible, and rightly so.

Provide medical support to counter spread of water borne diseases

current location and need to expand to meet our growing demand and take our
mission to a much higher level.</p>
<p>We’ll be creating a peaceful
(shanti), happy eco-village where you can get more than produce: an intentional
commUNITY of worldwide volunteers, an on-site Eco-store, housing on premises, and
a wide variety of community events and Empowerment Workshops. At Om Shanti, we
prefer a diversity in crops - wild and colorful layouts, like a botanical
garden with natural ponds, rather than monocultural farming with rows. We are
planning to grow crops that do well in Arizona like citrus, greens, pulses,
herbs, spices, grapes, then experiment with exotic varieties. </p>
<p><b>
</b></p>
<p><b>Budget / Startup Goal</b>: Your contribution will go towards the security deposit and first month's rent on our
new location in the Arizona area, making our first round of raised beds there,
renovating/remodeling existing structures, building a new, mobile Earthship for our volunteers and workshop trainers to reside in, and the construction of the
Eco-store. The bigger the gifts, the bigger and faster the reality. We’ll work
with whatever we raise, because there is no other rational choice for us, and
we are passionate about executing our vision. We’ll also be uniting with
sustainable supporters to host fundraising parties in both Arizona and Miami until we reach our startup
goal; however, we need your help to make it on Indiegogo’s front page of Most Popular Campaigns!</p>
<p><b>What will we offer at our new
location?</b></p>
<span><i><b>Eco-Store</b></i><br/></span>Our Eco-Store will supply even more of our trusted, local, truly organic
and natural food produce: all governed by permaculture practices far more
stringent than the FDA’s. We’ll also have up-cycled furniture and natural
gardening products available. Our sustainable practices will keep costs low so
we can give you more. At Om Shanti, we’re not motivated by greed. <span><br/><br/><i><b>Workshops and Eco-vocational Classes</b></i><br/><span>One of our objectives is to promote sustainable and healthy living.
Therefore, we will hold workshops and classes for all ages, emphasizing a hands-on
approach to learning the following: </span></span><br/>·  Natural Soap and Candle-making<br/><p>
·  Healthy Cooking - with an emphasis on international cuisine<br/>
·  Create!: Up-cycled Jewelry, Art and Furniture-making<br/>
·  Eco-vocational Training &amp; Up-cycling  <br/>
·  Survival &amp; Homesteading Skills<br/>
·  Gardening and composting: Techniques and Fundamentals<br/>
·  Yoga, Meditation &amp; Natural Remedies<br/>
·  Liquids &amp; Solids: Making Natural Drinks (including crop-based beer
&amp; wine) and Healthy Bread                                                                                                                                        ·  Sustainable Living &amp; Natural Building<br/>
·  Fermentation: Probiotics, Kefir &amp; Kombucha Production<br/>
·  Business and Legal: Green-related Business and Legal Skills</p>
<b>
</b><p><i><b>Community
Events &amp; Gathering Venue</b></i><span><b>                                                                     </b>Our fun, budget-conscious events are
intended to bring back unity and respect for one another; and promote a strong
sense of community. Events will have different themes, but will always be
geared towards a “green” and healthy (emotionally and physically) way of life.
Om Shanti will strive to be a popular, gathering venue for enthusiasts and
activists in the agricultural field and related topics to meet, discuss,
connect, raise awareness, share and take action.        <br/></span></p>
<b></b><p><span><b><i><span>Intentional Volunteer Community</span></i></b><br/>
Om Shanti’s primary objective is to become an intentional volunteer community
where foreigners and local residents interested in the “eco” movement can
reside free of charge in exchange for their skills, knowledge, labor and/or
services. Most importantly, we want to help grow green warriors, unite
sustainable supporters into one 

</span>Green World and work together to
promote sustainable living worldwide.<span>
<br/></span></p>
<p><b>Farming</b></p>
<p>Although we will be an educational
and experimental farm, Om Shanti will follow permaculture principles. With the
help of our volunteers, we’d like to experiment with various farming techniques
utilized in different countries; and we’ll eventually build a greenhouse and
outbuilding for those purposes. </p>
<p>Most of our workshops will take
place in outbuildings which will have their own garden. For example, the
brewery outbuilding will have its own Spirit Garden; as the outbuilding used to
teach various cooking skills will have its own garden and so forth. </p>
<p><b>What are we doing now? </b><span><br/></span></p>
<p><span>We’re still operating Om Shanti
Empowerment Center. Until we get a bigger place, we’re checking out locations,
meeting and uniting with a lot of cool, sustainable supporters and raising
money to finally make our dream a reality. In the meantime, we’re continuing to
garden, experimenting (on growing techniques, incorporating farming systems,
fermenting and probiotic recipes, etc.), and making a lot of the natural
products we would on the farm.<b><span><span>  </span></span></b></span></p>

This is more than just a hobby or community
business for us; this dream is about sustaining our survival, uniting with
like-minded people and improving the world one farm/garden at a time. We also
want to show people there are successful holistic methods to conducting
business and that it is perfectly acceptable to just say no to 9-5 cubicle
dwelling. If you share our vision of a healthier, greener, unified world, join
us and become part of our cherished family of sustainable supporters worldwide!<b><span></span></b><br/><br/><p><b>Who We Are: </b></p>
<p>Tatiana:<br/>
I'm a lawyer who left everything behind to unknowingly embark on my own,
extraordinary ""Eat, Pray, Love"" journey to sustainability, taking me
from Miami to New York to India, where I learned the techniques and
fundamentals of sustainable farming. I was extremely sick and exhausted from
being cuffed to cubicles where I gave my blood, sweat and tears to end up being
the first one laid off. I no longer felt fulfilled and was compelled to explore
other avenues. What I was ultimately looking for was a way to get involved in
something bigger than myself. <br/><br/>
In New York, I was offered the opportunity to volunteer my grant research and
writing skills to a reforestation project and sustainable vegan community in
South India that operated mainly through volunteers from all over the world. </p>

Rohit:<b><span></span></b><br/>I grew up in Udaipur, Rajasthan. I got involved in a non-profit organization that teaches alternative education, and it opened my eyes to a lot of other things. Since then, I started volunteering and attending many workshops. At 12 years old, I started traveling with a group of people all over India. With the newly found knowledge and independence acquired on my journey, I challenged my family that in one year, I would learn more traveling than being in school. I won the challenge and at the age of 14, I learned massage therapy. At 16, I again challenged myself to travel, but this time, without money. I learned a lot about myself and used my massage skills to convince people to contribute money for my journey, along with gardening, conducting children's workshops and helping out at restaurants. At that time is when I first went to the vegan community in South India, but I met Tatiana the fifth time I went to volunteer there. Along my journey, I also learned how to cook Indian/vegetarian/vegan and Thai cooking; acupressure; making natural jewelry from seeds, shells and even hydroponic clay pebbles. I also love to garden and make natural juices. <br/><p> </p>
<p>Together we travelled throughout
Southeast Asia, from India to Thailand, and eventually found our way back in
the United States – travelling in Florida and Georgia. All along this circuitous route we volunteering
at various farms and sustainable projects, building our knowledge and gaining
valuable experience. This wasn’t all we gained on this journey, we gained each
other and recently got married. <br/><br/>
In the end, we vowed not to return to the 9-5, constantly stressed life. This
is where the idea of the eco-village began, and the vision of Om Shanti
Empowerment Center was born.</p>
<b>A Peek Into the Future</b><p></p>
<p><span><b>Our ideal location would be to re-purpose an abandoned town!!</b> Imagine the first off-grid
eco-village that is an actual town! Throughout the United States, business has run
off in search of higher profits through cheap labor. Along the way they have
uprooted families and devastated infrastructure. In our search for land, we have
come across several towns abandoned by industry. We imagine a future where
projects like Om Shanti could repurpose these types of small abandoned towns,
growing green warriors in the ruins left by greedy business.</span><br/></p>
<br/><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Another way you can help is by
sharing our campaign with as many people as possible by using Indiegogo's share
tools. Proceeds from our workshops and <span>fundraising parties</span>, which can be found on our
Meetup page, will also go towards implementing the final phases of Om Shanti
Empowerment Center and the startup of the Eco-Village &amp; Farm Retreat.
And, most of all, help grow green warriors in your community and in yourselves
by supporting CSAs, growing gardens, and supporting green businesses in your
community! <br/></p>

garden with natural ponds, rather than monocultural farming with rows. We are
planning to grow crops that do well in Arizona like citrus, greens, pulses,
herbs, spices, grapes, then experiment with exotic varieties. 


Budget / Startup Goal: Your contribution will go towards the security deposit and first month's rent on our
new location in the Arizona area, making our first round of raised beds there,
renovating/remodeling existing structures, building a new, mobile Earthship for our volunteers and workshop trainers to reside in, and the construction of the
Eco-store. The bigger the gifts, the bigger and faster the reality. We’ll work
with whatever we raise, because there is no other rational choice for us, and
we are passionate about executing our vision. We’ll also be uniting with
sustainable supporters to host fundraising parties in both Arizona and Miami until we reach our startup
goal; however, we need your help to make it on Indiegogo’s front page of Most Popular Campaigns!
What will we offer at our new
location?
Eco-StoreOur Eco-Store will supply even more of our trusted, local, truly organic
and natural food produce: all governed by permaculture practices far more
stringent than the FDA’s. We’ll also have up-cycled furniture and natural
gardening products available. Our sustainable practices will keep costs low so
we can give you more. At Om Shanti, we’re not motivated by greed. Workshops and Eco-vocational ClassesOne of our objectives is to promote sustainable and healthy living.
Therefore, we will hold workshops and classes for all ages, emphasizing a hands-on
approach to learning the following: ·  Natural Soap and Candle-making
·  Healthy Cooking - with an emphasis on international cuisine
·  Create!: Up-cycled Jewelry, Art and Furniture-making
·  Eco-vocational Training & Up-cycling  
·  Survival & Homesteading Skills
·  Gardening and composting: Techniques and Fundamentals
·  Yoga, Meditation & Natural Remedies
·  Liquids & Solids: Making Natural Drinks (including crop-based beer
& wine) and Healthy Bread                                                                                                                                        ·  Sustainable Living & Natural Building
·  Fermentation: Probiotics, Kefir & Kombucha Production
·  Business and Legal: Green-related Business and Legal Skills

Community
Events & Gathering Venue                                                                     Our fun, budget-conscious events are
intended to bring back unity and respect for one another; and promote a strong
sense of community. Events will have different themes, but will always be
geared towards a “green” and healthy (emotionally and physically) way of life.
Om Shanti will strive to be a popular, gathering venue for enthusiasts and
activists in the agricultural field and related topics to meet, discuss,
connect, raise awareness, share and take action.        
Intentional Volunteer Community
Om Shanti’s primary objective is to become an intentional volunteer community
where foreigners and local residents interested in the “eco” movement can
reside free of charge in exchange for their skills, knowledge, labor and/or
services. Most importantly, we want to help grow green warriors, unite
sustainable supporters into one 

Green World and work together to
promote sustainable living worldwide.

Farming
Although we will be an educational
and experimental farm, Om Shanti will follow permaculture principles. With the
help of our volunteers, we’d like to experiment with various farming techniques
utilized in different countries; and we’ll eventually build a greenhouse and
outbuilding for those purposes. 
Most of our workshops will take
place in outbuildings which will have their own garden. For example, the
brewery outbuilding will have its own Spirit Garden; as the outbuilding used to
teach various cooking skills will have its own garden and so forth. 
What are we doing now? 
We’re still operating Om Shanti
Empowerment Center. Until we get a bigger place, we’re checking out locations,
meeting and uniting with a lot of cool, sustainable supporters and raising
money to finally make our dream a reality. In the meantime, we’re continuing to
garden, experimenting (on growing techniques, incorporating farming systems,
fermenting and probiotic recipes, etc.), and making a lot of the natural
products we would on the farm.  

This is more than just a hobby or community
business for us; this dream is about sustaining our survival, uniting with
like-minded people and improving the world one farm/garden at a time. We also
want to show people there are successful holistic methods to conducting
business and that it is perfectly acceptable to just say no to 9-5 cubicle
dwelling. If you share our vision of a healthier, greener, unified world, join
us and become part of our cherished family of sustainable supporters worldwide!Who We Are: 
Tatiana:
I'm a lawyer who left everything behind to unknowingly embark on my own,
extraordinary ""Eat, Pray, Love"" journey to sustainability, taking me
from Miami to New York to India, where I learned the techniques and
fundamentals of sustainable farming. I was extremely sick and exhausted from
being cuffed to cubicles where I gave my blood, sweat and tears to end up being
the first one laid off. I no longer felt fulfilled and was compelled to explore
other avenues. What I was ultimately looking for was a way to get involved in
something bigger than myself. 
In New York, I was offered the opportunity to volunteer my grant research and
writing skills to a reforestation project and sustainable vegan community in
South India that operated mainly through volunteers from all over the world. 

Rohit:I grew up in Udaipur, Rajasthan. I got involved in a non-profit organization that teaches alternative education, and it opened my eyes to a lot of other things. Since then, I started volunteering and attending many workshops. At 12 years old, I started traveling with a group of people all over India. With the newly found knowledge and independence acquired on my journey, I challenged my family that in one year, I would learn more traveling than being in school. I won the challenge and at the age of 14, I learned massage therapy. At 16, I again challenged myself to travel, but this time, without money. I learned a lot about myself and used my massage skills to convince people to contribute money for my journey, along with gardening, conducting children's workshops and helping out at restaurants. At that time is when I first went to the vegan community in South India, but I met Tatiana the fifth time I went to volunteer there. Along my journey, I also learned how to cook Indian/vegetarian/vegan and Thai cooking; acupressure; making natural jewelry from seeds, shells and even hydroponic clay pebbles. I also love to garden and make natural juices.  
Together we travelled throughout
Southeast Asia, from India to Thailand, and eventually found our way back in
the United States – travelling in Florida and Georgia. All along this circuitous route we volunteering
at various farms and sustainable projects, building our knowledge and gaining
valuable experience. This wasn’t all we gained on this journey, we gained each
other and recently got married. 
In the end, we vowed not to return to the 9-5, constantly stressed life. This
is where the idea of the eco-village began, and the vision of Om Shanti
Empowerment Center was born.
A Peek Into the Future
Our ideal location would be to re-purpose an abandoned town!! Imagine the first off-grid
eco-village that is an actual town! Throughout the United States, business has run
off in search of higher profits through cheap labor. Along the way they have
uprooted families and devastated infrastructure. In our search for land, we have
come across several towns abandoned by industry. We imagine a future where
projects like Om Shanti could repurpose these types of small abandoned towns,
growing green warriors in the ruins left by greedy business.
Other Ways You Can Help
Another way you can help is by
sharing our campaign with as many people as possible by using Indiegogo's share
tools. Proceeds from our workshops and fundraising parties, which can be found on our
Meetup page, will also go towards implementing the final phases of Om Shanti
Empowerment Center and the startup of the Eco-Village & Farm Retreat.
And, most of all, help grow green warriors in your community and in yourselves
by supporting CSAs, growing gardens, and supporting green businesses in your
community!

I am Dr. Wanda Whittlesey-Jerome, and I am an associate professor in the School of Social Work at New Mexico State University. My research focus is on building an evidence-base for the use of horses in psychotherapy, and the model I choose to focus on is Equine Assisted Growth and Learning Association's (EAGALA) Equine-Assisted Psychotherapy (EAP).  This treatment model is REALLY UNIQUE - because everything is 100% on-the-ground. There is no riding!!!!!</p><p>You may wonder why anyone would want to spend time with horses if they are not riding! Well, the truth is that when you are on a horse's level, miraculous things can happen! First, you must learn to negotiate a relationship with a prey animal that outweighs you by at least 1,000 pounds and is probably scared of you in some way, too. Second, horses are hyper-vigilant. That means they are sensing and perceiving every second (in case a predator is near - which might be you, by the way!) and they are honest and curious, and very social beings. Take it from me, being on the ground with horses can change your life in incredible ways for the better!</p><p>My current campaign is to raise funds so medically-retired Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation New Dawn veterans can receive EAP in order to decrease their military-related stress and increase their health and wellbeing. It is a small pilot study that will hopefully lead to a HUGE Department of Defense (DoD) grant in 2015. THIS IS PART OF WHY I AM ASKING YOU TO HELP ME FUND THIS PILOT STUDY.</p><p>I received 5,000.00 from my college (College of Health and Social Services) and need to match that amount. YOUR GIFT WILL GO ENTIRELY TO PAYING FOR THE EAP TREATMENT so the veterans will not have to pay a thing. I am reimbursing them for their travel using the Federal Rate, and am providing food and water at the upcoming recruitment events. This will all come out of my pocket.</p><p>EAP requires an EAGALA-certified mental health therapist and an EAGALA-certified equine specialist. These professionals provide the treatment in an arena with horses. Horses eat a lot of hay, and drink a lot of water. They need attention every day, and safe places to sleep at night and rest during the day. As such, EAP is expensive to provide, </p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">However, EAP is a relatively brief, solution-focused approach to problem-solving and skills-building, so it actually costs less than long-term psychtherapy typically offered in an office-setting. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Imagine - for each veteran participant there could be family members and/or important others who may benefit once the veteran begins the process of heart-healing. </span></p><p>HEART-HEALING is what takes place when a wounded warrior returns home from battle. Having seen what he or she has seen, experienced, and probably dreamt about, they often return with a ""break"" in the psyche - a sense of ""disconnection"" - especially to soft, warm, loving feelings - that must be healed. This is what HEART-HEALING is all about. </p><p>I have recently published an article on the healing impact of EAP on adult female victims of interpersonal violence (IV). My article includes a comprehensive literature review on EAP and IV, and in case you want to read it, the link is here: <a href=""http://www.thepractitionerscholar.com/article/view/13570"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.thepractitionerscholar.com/article/view/13570</a></p><p>I am joined on this pilot study by my graduate students who are also veterans. I am working closely with the Army Wounded Warrior Advocate of New Mexico, the Albuquerque Veterans Recovery Center, and Guadalupe Stables, LLC, of the North Valley of Albuquerque. </p><p>The pilot study will begin after receiving Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, which should be shortly. Then, after a round of recruitment events and meetings, the study will stretch 12 weeks and wrap-up in January of 2015. I will know in late spring whether or not I was awarded the large DoD grant for a much larger study.</p><p>Regardless of the DoD grant in the future, this small pilot study will serve 42 + participants, which is a very good size for a pilot - larger than many. For each of those participants, there will be others in their lives who can benefit as well.</p><p>THERE ARE PERKS FOR FUNDERS! For 100,00, I will send you a .pdf of the manuscript once the study is published. For 250.00, I will send you a new  DVD that includes myself, the EAP professionals, the horses, and a session of Veterans Recovery Center clinicians actually experiencing EAP for the first time - so you can see with your own eyes and hear with your own ears what they are sensing, perceiving, feeling and thinking. It should be QUITE SOMETHING TO SEE!</p><p>Please share my Indiegogo campaign link with others you think might be interested in supporting my study. With all my HEART,  I thank you most sincerely!!!</p></div>","WELCOME TO MY CAMPAIGN TO FUND MY EQUINE RESEARCH WITH VETERANS!

First, you must learn to negotiate a relationship with a prey animal that outweighs you by at least 1,000 pounds and is probably scared of you in some way, too. Second, horses are hyper-vigilant. That means they are sensing and perceiving every second (in case a predator is near - which might be you, by the way!) and they are honest and curious, and very social beings. Take it from me, being on the ground with horses can change your life in incredible ways for the better!My current campaign is to raise funds so medically-retired Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation New Dawn veterans can receive EAP in order to decrease their military-related stress and increase their health and wellbeing. It is a small pilot study that will hopefully lead to a HUGE Department of Defense (DoD) grant in 2015. THIS IS PART OF WHY I AM ASKING YOU TO HELP ME FUND THIS PILOT STUDY.I received 5,000.00 from my college (College of Health and Social Services) and need to match that amount. YOUR GIFT WILL GO ENTIRELY TO PAYING FOR THE EAP TREATMENT so the veterans will not have to pay a thing. I am reimbursing them for their travel using the Federal Rate, and am providing food and water at the upcoming recruitment events. This will all come out of my pocket.EAP requires an EAGALA-certified mental health therapist and an EAGALA-certified equine specialist. These professionals provide the treatment in an arena with horses. Horses eat a lot of hay, and drink a lot of water. They need attention every day, and safe places to sleep at night and rest during the day. As such, EAP is expensive to provide, However, EAP is a relatively brief, solution-focused approach to problem-solving and skills-building, so it actually costs less than long-term psychtherapy typically offered in an office-setting. Imagine - for each veteran participant there could be family members and/or important others who may benefit once the veteran begins the process of heart-healing. HEART-HEALING is what takes place when a wounded warrior returns home from battle. Having seen what he or she has seen, experienced, and probably dreamt about, they often return with a ""break"" in the psyche - a sense of ""disconnection"" - especially to soft, warm, loving feelings - that must be healed. This is what HEART-HEALING is all about. I have recently published an article on the healing impact of EAP on adult female victims of interpersonal violence (IV). My article includes a comprehensive literature review on EAP and IV, and in case you want to read it, the link is here: http://www.thepractitionerscholar.com/article/view/13570I am joined on this pilot study by my graduate students who are also veterans. I am working closely with the Army Wounded Warrior Advocate of New Mexico, the Albuquerque Veterans Recovery Center, and Guadalupe Stables, LLC, of the North Valley of Albuquerque. The pilot study will begin after receiving Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, which should be shortly. Then, after a round of recruitment events and meetings, the study will stretch 12 weeks and wrap-up in January of 2015. I will know in late spring whether or not I was awarded the large DoD grant for a much larger study.Regardless of the DoD grant in the future, this small pilot study will serve 42 + participants, which is a very good size for a pilot - larger than many. For each of those participants, there will be others in their lives who can benefit as well.THERE ARE PERKS FOR FUNDERS! For 100,00, I will send you a .pdf of the manuscript once the study is published. For 250.00, I will send you a new  DVD that includes myself, the EAP professionals, the horses, and a session of Veterans Recovery Center clinicians actually experiencing EAP for the first time - so you can see with your own eyes and hear with your own ears what they are sensing, perceiving, feeling and thinking. It should be QUITE SOMETHING TO SEE!Please share my Indiegogo campaign link with others you think might be interested in supporting my study. With all my HEART,  I thank you most sincerely!!!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p class=""MsoNormal""><br/></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Dear Friends,</p>
<br/><p class=""LetterBody"">For those of you who don’t know, I am going  to Kenya for 5 months to try to help build a Children's Home (or at least help it get rolling) and I'd like to  tell you about how you can help. Back in September took a month leave to visit the Belwop Children’s Home in Nyeri,
Kenya. I stayed on-site with the kids and with the director, a widow and fellow
believer named Veronica Mumbi, whom I am blessed to call friend.This trip ruined me, in the best way, and now I feel called to help make a difference there and here.</p>
<p class=""LetterBody"">Basically, the verse in James that states that TRUE Religion, the kind that that God accepts as pure and faultless-- <span style=""font-style: italic;"">HOLY</span>-- is just this: To take care of widows and orphans in their distress... that's it. Then I met a widow who takes care of orphans, whose faith is unlike anything I've ever witnessed, and realized maybe this wasn't an accident? Here was  a opportunity for religion to be put into action, for me, and anyone who wants to join. A need for a real home.</p>
<p class=""LetterBody"">That was 4 years ago, and today, we have partnerships starting all over the place to make this dream a reality. Together, through making coffee, and playing music, selling T-shirts and bracelets, we have helped them come out of debt, purchase land, and now we want to move forward. No longer will these amazing kids have to sleep in a rented facility or worry about their next meal. Soon, they will have a place to sleep with colorful walls and comfortable beds and a kitchen full of food</p>

Dear Friends,
For those of you who don’t know, I am going  to Kenya for 5 months to try to help build a Children's Home (or at least help it get rolling) and I'd like to  tell you about how you can help. Back in September took a month leave to visit the Belwop Children’s Home in Nyeri,

Basically, the verse in James that states that TRUE Religion, the kind that that God accepts as pure and faultless-- HOLY-- is just this: To take care of widows and orphans in their distress... that's it. Then I met a widow who takes care of orphans, whose faith is unlike anything I've ever witnessed, and realized maybe this wasn't an accident?

No longer will these amazing kids have to sleep in a rented facility or worry about their next meal. Soon, they will have a place to sleep with colorful walls and comfortable beds and a kitchen full of food
But we have a ways to go.....

THE IMPACT
 SO far, through giving of
funds from our True Religion Concert series and other fundraisers, we have raised enough to:
1.) buy 1 square acre of Land!
2.) design blue prints
3.) sponsor the kids and send them to school
4.) get started on the preliminary foundation

<h2><strong>What is Aspen Valley Foods?</strong></h2>
<p>It’s an on-line marketplace of products from the finest, local, small growers, producers and food artisans in the United States. All our food is healthy, delicious tasting, natural, organic and sustainably produced. We offer food from just about every category you can think of, except for fresh produce and dairy.</p>
<p>Not everyone has a farmer’s market nearby, and mostly these are only available in the summer, so we offer real convenience, wherever you live.</p>
<p>And there’s another big difference with our food other than convenience. After selecting it from producers and artisans who meet our rigid natural and organic production standards, we have top chefs test it all to find which tastes best and what’s the best way to prepare and present it. That way you don’t have to have potentially costly and time consuming (not to mention disappointing or embarrassing) experiments to find what really works for you.</p>
<p>With the convenience of on-line shopping (with prompt delivery) you only have one stop, just like a market. No more searching for grass-fed beef or artisan cheeses (for example) from dozens of sites – we locate them, test them, then offer you a selection of the best in each of sixteen food categories, in one easy to use market style site. Simple, fun shopping from your computer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.aspenvalleyfoods.com/indegogo/leaves-centered.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2><strong>What We Believe In</strong></h2>
<p>We believe in sustainability. The Earth’s resources are too precious to be used just once. The food we sell will be produced and distributed with complete concern for the environment.</p>
<p class=""gray"">We will source and certify our foods only from the finest ranches, farms, vineyards, dairies, bakeries and food artisans in North America. Our suppliers produce on a modest scale, not on an industrial, non-sustainable scale.</p>
<p class=""gray"">Our food will be healthy, produced to uncompromising standards and definitions of <em>natural, organic, family farmed</em> and <em>sustainable</em> established by entities such as the Food Alliance and The Association of Family Farms.</p>
<p class=""gray"">Our food will taste great as well as being healthy. So we have top Chefs select and test it in advance.</p>
<p class=""gray"">We respect local farmers markets. Our desire is to bring good foods to buyers who are unable to participate in these markets, or who wish for a broader range of such products than are typically available at farmers markets.</p>
<p class=""gray"">We believe in transparency of information about our food, and we make authentic, verified source of production data for the origin of all our foods readily available to our customers.</p>
<p class=""gray"">We will deliver a superior shopping experience to our customers with a 100% guarantee.</p>
<p>For a complete statement of our Credo, go to <a href=""http://www.aspenvalleyfoods.com/we-are-avf.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Aspen Valley Foods"">www.aspenvalleyfoods.com/we-are-avf.php</a> <strong> <br/></strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.aspenvalleyfoods.com/indegogo/leaves-centered.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2><strong>Why We Started Aspen Valley Foods</strong></h2>
<p>First of all, we simply don’t believe industrially produced food is either good for our bodies, our communities or our planet.</p>
<p>Second, we could see the market for natural and organic food was surging in the U.S., growing on average 10% each year. Plus, it has proven to be recession proof, predictable growth.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the growth of on-line shopping for food is also exploding, especially for higher-end quality (including natural and organic) foods.</p>
<p>Lastly, we believe in supporting smaller producers and food artisans; we live in a small mountain community close to ranchers, orchardists, wine makers, artisan bakers and a host of smaller producers of cheese, preserves and sauces. We love their healthy, naturally produced food and would like to see it enjoyed more widely.</p>
<p> <strong> <br/></strong></p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.aspenvalleyfoods.com/indegogo/leaves-centered.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2><strong>What We’ve Done So Far</strong></h2>
<p>To test their ideas, the two founders, Alan Pilkington and Martha Silva, raised some seed capital from Friends and Family to support their personal capital contributions. They then tested the concept with over 1,000 American food and cooking enthusiasts in an on-line study by a top Internet research group. Guess what? People loved the idea; nearly 60% said they’d become customers.</p>
<p>Confirmed and even more enthusiastic and confident, they then created a comprehensive Business Plan and Private Placement Memorandum for investors. They recruited an experienced and talented group (over 20) of advisors to help create the plan and to vet it.

<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.aspenvalleyfoods.com/indegogo/Rewards_Levels_Icons_web.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div>","What is Aspen Valley Foods?
It’s an on-line marketplace of products from the finest, local, small growers, producers and food artisans in the United States. All our food is healthy, delicious tasting, natural, organic and sustainably produced. We offer food from just about every category you can think of, except for fresh produce and dairy.
Not everyone has a farmer’s market nearby, and mostly these are only available in the summer, so we offer real convenience, wherever you live.
And there’s another big difference with our food other than convenience. After selecting it from producers and artisans who meet our rigid natural and organic production standards, we have top chefs test it all to find which tastes best and what’s the best way to prepare and present it. That way you don’t have to have potentially costly and time consuming (not to mention disappointing or embarrassing) experiments to find what really works for you.
With the convenience of on-line shopping (with prompt delivery) you only have one stop, just like a market. No more searching for grass-fed beef or artisan cheeses (for example) from dozens of sites – we locate them, test them, then offer you a selection of the best in each of sixteen food categories, in one easy to use market style site. Simple, fun shopping from your computer.
 

What We Believe In
We believe in sustainability. The Earth’s resources are too precious to be used just once. The food we sell will be produced and distributed with complete concern for the environment.
We will source and certify our foods only from the finest ranches, farms, vineyards, dairies, bakeries and food artisans in North America. Our suppliers produce on a modest scale, not on an industrial, non-sustainable scale.
Our food will be healthy, produced to uncompromising standards and definitions of natural, organic, family farmed and sustainable established by entities such as the Food Alliance and The Association of Family Farms.
Our food will taste great as well as being healthy. So we have top Chefs select and test it in advance.
We respect local farmers markets. Our desire is to bring good foods to buyers who are unable to participate in these markets, or who wish for a broader range of such products than are typically available at farmers markets.
We believe in transparency of information about our food, and we make authentic, verified source of production data for the origin of all our foods readily available to our customers.
We will deliver a superior shopping experience to our customers with a 100% guarantee.
For a complete statement of our Credo, go to www.aspenvalleyfoods.com/we-are-avf.php  
 

Why We Started Aspen Valley Foods
First of all, we simply don’t believe industrially produced food is either good for our bodies, our communities or our planet.
Second, we could see the market for natural and organic food was surging in the U.S., growing on average 10% each year. Plus, it has proven to be recession proof, predictable growth.
Thirdly, the growth of on-line shopping for food is also exploding, especially for higher-end quality (including natural and organic) foods.
Lastly, we believe in supporting smaller producers and food artisans; we live in a small mountain community close to ranchers, orchardists, wine makers, artisan bakers and a host of smaller producers of cheese, preserves and sauces. We love their healthy, naturally produced food and would like to see it enjoyed more widely.
  

What We’ve Done So Far
To test their ideas, the two founders, Alan Pilkington and Martha Silva, raised some seed capital from Friends and Family to support their personal capital contributions. They then tested the concept with over 1,000 American food and cooking enthusiasts in an on-line study by a top Internet research group. Guess what? People loved the idea; nearly 60% said they’d become customers.
Confirmed and even more enthusiastic and confident, they then created a comprehensive Business Plan and Private Placement Memorandum for investors. They recruited an experienced and talented group (over 20) of advisors to help create the plan and to vet it. At present there are over a dozen committed investors, but the company is still well short of its ambitious goal.
The reason is simple. The founders have a vision for a significant company, in its size as well as its high standards. Creating a national supply network of smaller producers and artisans, a comprehensive and competitive website, an extensive marketing and social media communications plan, complete on-line fulfillment, delivery and customer service systems for sixteen food categories and over five hundred products is no easy task, nor one for the faint of heart.
 

Our Path to the Future

We need a warehouse, a food testing facility and an office. Whew! All this takes a lot of capital (in the low $ millions), but the great news is we have identified a source which can provide all the funding we need, over and above what we’ve already raised.
The source is a special U.S. Government Program known as EB-5, a description of which can be found on our website www.aspenvalleyfoods.com/financial.php
 

The Next Big Step
In order to access this capital, and especially because it involves the U.S. government, we need to create a very special application.
It will involve specialized attorneys, economists, plan writers and others. We have to take our already thorough plan to a whole new level. In many ways it’s like creating a major grant application for a foundation or a university, for those of you familiar with such matters.

<span>Improving the Experience of Birth for All Families in Miami</span><br/>
</h3><p>When we opened <a href=""http://www.theplacewegather.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Gathering Place</a> two years ago, our mission was to improve the experience of birth for all women and families in Miami by establishing a dynamic, independent center for childbirth education, breastfeeding, parenting, and women's health care. We wanted to be a catalyst for change in our community by creating an environment where women and families could learn how to be full participants in their care and ensure they would approach pregnancy and parenting with information and confidence. The successes we have had along the way are due to the support and encouragement of our community - our moms and dads and babies, our staff, our mentors and our families. Our vision is a work in progress, the next phase of which is opening a birth center within the City of Miami.<br/><br/><strong><span>We have a management team, a business plan, and a viable site in place. I</span>n order to make this next step a reality, we need your support.  </strong></p><p></p><h3>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0.06em;"">Women in South Florida need a community birthing center! #OneBigPush</span><br/>
</h3>Options are disappearing. Interventions are rising. Disparities are growing. South Florida is a challenging place to have a baby. <p><br/></p><p><span><b><i>A birth center will improve outcomes, including:</i></b></span><br/><br/></p><ul>
<li>
<b>REDUCING FINANCIAL &amp; CULTURAL BARRIERS.</b> Miami-Dade County has one of the highest uninsured rates in the country due to the high rates of poverty and immigration. More than 700,000 residents (29.2%) have no health insurance, and prenatal care is rarely 
offered regardless of ability to pay. Magnolia will open its doors to many populations who may typically feel unwelcome in standard healthcare facilities, including the working poor, recent immigrants and adolescents.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>LOWERING HIGH C-SECTION RATES. </b>Miami has the frightening distinction of having one of highest rates of cesarean section in the nation - 1 in 2 women in Miami-Dade County gives birth by surgery. Of the ten facilities statewide with the highest cesarean rate, six are located in our county. Women in the care of midwives have lower than the national average <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">rate for primary cesarean (4.4% to 9.9%, compared to 32%). The cesarean section rate for women receiving care in birth centers 
averages 6.1%, approximately one-half that in studies of low risk, 
in-hospital births. <br/><br/></span>
</li>
<li>
<b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">CLOSING THE HEALTH DISPARITY GAP. </b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The black infant mortality rate in Miami-Dade is almost three times higher than the infant mortality rate for white infants. </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Midwife-led care of low-risk women in birth center settings has yielded promising results, including reduction of poor birth outcomes like low birth weight, pre-term labor and infant mortality.<br/><br/></span>
</li>
<li><p><b>ELEVATING NORMAL BIRTH.</b> Birth typically takes place in a hospital room, where women are confined to their beds by continuous fetal monitors and offered little one-to-one labor support. At birth centers, women are encouraged to eat  if they are hungry, move 
about, spend time in a tub as they wish, and push  in whatever 
positions they find most comfortable.<br/></p></li>
<li><p><b>LOWERING COSTS BY REDUCING INTERVENTIONS.</b> Nationwide 8-11% of babies are delivered by midwives, yet only a handful certified nurse midwives have privileges to deliver at area hospitals. Women who receive care from midwives have a significantly higher chance for a normal vaginal birth, fewer interventions, and successful initiation of breastfeeding.</p></li>
<li>
<b><b>IMPROVING BREASTFEEDING OUTCOMES.</b></b> In the majority of area hospitals, mothers and babies are still routinely separated after birth. Breastfeeding support postpartum is often little more than lip-service, 
with formula feeding suggested at the first sign of difficulty. More than 75% of 
women in Miami-Dade County initiate breastfeeding immediately following delivery but only 9.9% continue
 to 6 months. None of Miami's hospitals meet the requirements for being Baby-Friendly. Magnolia will pursue Baby-Friendly designation.<br/>

When we opened The Gathering Place two years ago, our mission was to improve the experience of birth for all women and families in Miami by establishing a dynamic, independent center for childbirth education, breastfeeding, parenting, and women's health care. We wanted to be a catalyst for change in our community by creating an environment where women and families could learn how to be full participants in their care and ensure they would approach pregnancy and parenting with information and confidence. The successes we have had along the way are due to the support and encouragement of our community - our moms and dads and babies, our staff, our mentors and our families. Our vision is a work in progress, the next phase of which is opening a birth center within the City of Miami.We have a management team, a business plan, and a viable site in place. In order to make this next step a reality, we need your support.  
Women in South Florida need a community birthing center! #OneBigPush
Options are disappearing. Interventions are rising. Disparities are growing. South Florida is a challenging place to have a baby. A birth center will improve outcomes, including:

REDUCING FINANCIAL & CULTURAL BARRIERS. Miami-Dade County has one of the highest uninsured rates in the country due to the high rates of poverty and immigration. More than 700,000 residents (29.2%) have no health insurance, and prenatal care is rarely 
offered regardless of ability to pay. Magnolia will open its doors to many populations who may typically feel unwelcome in standard healthcare facilities, including the working poor, recent immigrants and adolescents.


LOWERING HIGH C-SECTION RATES. Miami has the frightening distinction of having one of highest rates of cesarean section in the nation - 1 in 2 women in Miami-Dade County gives birth by surgery. Of the ten facilities statewide with the highest cesarean rate, six are located in our county. Women in the care of midwives have lower than the national average rate for primary cesarean (4.4% to 9.9%, compared to 32%). The cesarean section rate for women receiving care in birth centers 
averages 6.1%, approximately one-half that in studies of low risk, 
in-hospital births. 


CLOSING THE HEALTH DISPARITY GAP. The black infant mortality rate in Miami-Dade is almost three times higher than the infant mortality rate for white infants. Midwife-led care of low-risk women in birth center settings has yielded promising results, including reduction of poor birth outcomes like low birth weight, pre-term labor and infant mortality.

ELEVATING NORMAL BIRTH. Birth typically takes place in a hospital room, where women are confined to their beds by continuous fetal monitors and offered little one-to-one labor support. At birth centers, women are encouraged to eat  if they are hungry, move 
about, spend time in a tub as they wish, and push  in whatever 
positions they find most comfortable.
LOWERING COSTS BY REDUCING INTERVENTIONS. Nationwide 8-11% of babies are delivered by midwives, yet only a handful certified nurse midwives have privileges to deliver at area hospitals. Women who receive care from midwives have a significantly higher chance for a normal vaginal birth, fewer interventions, and successful initiation of breastfeeding.

IMPROVING BREASTFEEDING OUTCOMES. In the majority of area hospitals, mothers and babies are still routinely separated after birth. Breastfeeding support postpartum is often little more than lip-service, 
with formula feeding suggested at the first sign of difficulty. More than 75% of 
women in Miami-Dade County initiate breastfeeding immediately following delivery but only 9.9% continue
 to 6 months. None of Miami's hospitals meet the requirements for being Baby-Friendly. Magnolia will pursue Baby-Friendly designation.


INCREASED OPTIONS FOR MIDWIVES. Currently none of South Florida's existing birthing centers operate under an ""open model"" with a documented process which allows community midwives to apply for privileges and utilize the facility for their private clients. 
Our  mission is to improve the quality of health care for all women in 
Miami Dade  County by establishing a dynamic, independent center for 
birth and women's health care. Families in our community need a birth center that provides access for all midwives and all women and their families.  Here's how your money will help open the birth center’s doors
Our goal is that, starting in early Fall 2014, families in the Miami area 
will be able to birth at Magnolia Birth House. Our funding target for this campaign is $100,000. Here is where your money goes:
SECURING THE LEASE. We will be negotiating a lease term agreement of 5-10 years with the proposed landlord including credit during construction

FURNISHINGS, EQUIPMENT & SUPPLIES. Initial start-up expenses include legal expenses, accreditation/designation application, licenses, permits, office space, medical equipment, office equipment, and furniture.


BUILD OUT. Our proposed commercial space has already been renovated to meet current City of Miami zoning requirements and meets birth center specifications including ADA compliance as required by Florida’s birth center law and adequate parking. The property will need to be built out additionally to create two additional birthing suites, practitioner offices and a large classroom space.


IMPLEMENTATION OF MARKETING PLAN. In 2012, more than 36,000 women gave birth in Miami-Dade County. With an aggressive marketing campaign, Magnolia could capture less than 1% of births in the County and operate at or above capacity.

All women and their newborn babies deserve the best, and we are creating
 a beautiful, personalized, state-of-the-art facility specifically designed to meet their needs.Our fundraising goal is large but achievable. Every donation - even a few dollars - will help us reach our goal and open our doors.Other Ways You Can HelpMaybe you can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean you can’t help:

<h3>The Breakdown</h3>
<p>Last year I volunteered grunt work and helped tear down Burning Man. In appreciation of this work the organization promised me a 'gift ticket' for this year. At the same time the sheet was going around to sign up to acknowledge and accept this gift in advance, another sheet was going around to reimburse people for what they spent on a ticket for that year. I asked if this was in addition to a gift ticket, and somebody acting in a position of authority said YES.</p>
<p>Apparently, they were wrong.</p>
<p>Recently, volunteer coordinators reached out to me to inform me of this, and now despite my best efforts at sticking up for my integrity and honor, I'm left in the position of having agreed to help set up the entire shebang this year, help another camp get settled (CouchBurners), and help burn down a major art project I helped out with some (SeaCoRE)- all while having NO TICKET!!!</p>
<p>I did not budget for this, at all!</p>

<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I have until MONDAY to click on a special link i was given that I can only click ONCE to purchase a ticket, with a credit card in my name. Whether the organizers feel bad or really need the help, I couldn't speculate. I WANT to help and see this through! </p>

Taste is knowing the true quality ! Summertime is all about dining al fresco & under the stars ! !Brush aside stereotypes to move forward and help us create and develop an outdoor restaurant run by people with special needs.Like the general population,each person with a disability is an 
individual. They all have their own hopes, dreams, likes and 
dislikes. Disabled people who can work and who want to work face myriad 
barriers..
 

It's to our advantage to make the world a better place and teach 
people to accept themselves and to accept others. Help us give to 
special people the opportunity to participate in new experiences! We
 are asking you to work with us to develop a serious understanding of 
disabled people and the support they need to find employment.

My personal experience:I have been 
fighting since my birth due to congenital heart defects. My heart 
doesn’t beat regularly so I had my first heart surgery when I was only 
18 years old when doctors decide to place a pacemaker in my chest to 
help control my abnormal heart rhythms.
This device,     uses electrical pulses to prompt the heart to beat at a normal rate 
and I have already replaced it once. I will replace it again in about 4 
years. Nowadays, through my personal experience in my 34's, helping special people through employment is one of my tasks. 

 
My idea is to compine great food and great motivated and talented people through dining in a casual and often party-like atmosphere.
                           La petite Cantine's Philosophy:A great outdoor 
petite restaurant is more than patio tables and umbrellas; it must 
thoughtfully create a sense of personality and character.
                                       I think that eating outside enriches any meal. Our carefully planned and lovingly prepared menu will take you on a trip to the Mediterranean with recipes that none of them take more than 20 minutes to make.

<p>We are Nano Metallics.   A team comprised of a research scientist with an in-depth background in physics and chemistry, and an entrepreneur - both humanitarians interested in bringing real solutions that make a big difference to society.</p>
<p>Our research scientist has spent the last 45 years in various research roles, working with varied sciences.  He holds 42 patents for various applications and processes.</p>
<p>Our entrepreneur and team leader as over 30 years of international business experience and manufacturing.  His recent work has been focused on environmental clean-ups and large scale industrial remediation.  His most recent efforts were spent bringing 
technology to Kuwait for cleaning up oil spilled in the desert 
after the first Gulf War - as part of a remediation initiative under a joint Kuwaiti-United Nations project.<br/></p>
<p>Our research scientist's recent research and development has led to a 
method
for delivering nano metallic particles for the control of microbiological growth and
inactivation of viruses in unoccupied spaces.<span> 
Metallic ions in nano-sized particles are a known and proven science for
inactivating viruses, bacteria, algae, fungi and harmful microbes.  </span></p>
<p>Specifically, he has developed a unique method that can be used to deliver a known science in a small, simple, low-cost, and highly effective device that can control the spread of the Ebola epidemic on Western Africa.  Each device shipped would also offer years of repeat operation to help control any future virus outbreaks. <br/></p>
<p>This effort can be critical in helping the people of this region (and beyond) find a real solution for controlling the spread of this awful virus.<br/></p>

<p>Before we can bring the device to the region, we have to file patent protection.  A total of 8 patents need to be filed.  Our budget for this is $70,000.  In addition, we need to purchase raw materials for building as many demonstration devises as possible.  We currently have 2 devices built, but need to build many more.  Our budget for demonstration devices is $85,000.  An additional $15,000 wold be used to transport the demonstration devices to he region via air freight.  We are also looking to travel to the region and hold several demonstrations.  We have already been invited to the Ivory Coast by the Ministry of Health, and Senegal by a local private group.  We plan to travel elsewhere in the region to offer as many demonstrations as possible.  Our travel budget to bring a team of persons to Western Africa for the demonstrations is $35,000.  We would also spend $8,000 on building an interactive website that would track our development of the project and host real time (or near real time) updates of the team's progress and demonstrations in Western Africa.  The budget for Indiegogo Fixed Fee is $10,000.  We would reserve the remaining $27,000 for any cost over-runs, additional fees paid to Indiegogo, general business needs, and have funds to help initiate additional manufacturing of devices upon our return.</p>

<strong>Purchasing 4 My Cause </strong>is an online specialty food, personal and corporate gift store founded on the same straightforward idea—purchase everyday items you want…at the same price you find in your local store… and <strong>generate a 15% donation of your purchase price to support the <em><span>Cause of YOUR choice!</span></em></strong>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><strong><em><a href=""http://purchasing4mycause.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://purchasing4mycause.com</a></em></strong></blockquote>
<p>In August 2014 we launched <i style=""font-weight: bold;"">Purchasing 4 My Cause. </i>This was in response to many people celebrating our business model, but being frustrated that they could not use it to support Causes and Organizations that were important to them.  <b><i>Purchasing 4 My Cause</i></b> has been launched to support any and all community based effort (non-profit or not) that is makes a difference in our communities and our customers call it ""My Cause"".  Food Banks and Pantries can be selected, but now education, medical research (i.e. national or local cancer research organizations), church efforts, art organizations, and just about any effort to make our world a better place can be supported through individual or corporate purchases at Purchasing 4 My Cause.</p>
<h3>We Can Give 15% Because We Do Not Market...Time to Market Our Message Is Now!</h3>
<p>We are able to allow the 15% donation of our customers' purchase price to the Cause or Organization of <i>THEIR CHOICE</i>, by essentially eliminating the marketing costs of acquiring new customers via partnering with Non-profits and Corporations to ""spread the word"" about their exceptional results from purchasing items through <b>Meals 4 Others </b>and <strong>Purchasing 4 My Cause</strong>. Our customers share with other corporations in their communities the positive and grateful feedback received from gift recipients and the impact on their businesses of having partnered with a <b>PS It Matters</b> company.<br/></p>
<p>While we ultimately believe that this successful referral-based model is the correct approach to grow the companies, prove profitability and positively impact so many communities, <b><i>the time has come to get the word out by traditional marketing effort via print, direct mail and advertising!</i></b></p> </div> <div> <h3>Our Plans....Your Benefits...The Impact</h3> <p>Great ideas are only great if people know about them and can embrace them.  Our steady growth over the last 3 years proves that when people are made aware of <b>Meals 4 Others</b> and <b>Purchasing 4 My Cause</b>, they will utilize us regularly for personal and corporate gifts, gear and marketing materials.  Because we believe we are very close to monthly profitability, we do not want to change the business model in any form.  We will utilize traditional marketing outreach to share with as many people as possible what they can do both individually and corporately--<i>without spending an additional dime</i>--to support their Causes/Organizations, their Communities and, as corporations, to truly set themselves apart from their competitors.</p>
<p>Because we are in an advanced start-up stage, the ability to spend any amount of funding on marketing efforts will make a huge impact on our ability to expand individual and corporate client base.  If we are able to meet our funding goal, double our funding goal or achieve 30% of our funding goal, each of these result would advance the presence of <b>Meals 4 Others</b> and <b>Purchasing 4 My Cause</b> in the general marketplace.  While important to all of us at <b>PS It Matters</b>, it has an incredible impact on the organizations that will receive donations directed through our expanded customer base.</p>
<p>We are now seeking your direct support of our efforts to change the world to be a better place with each purchase at <b>Meals 4 Others</b> and <b>Purchasing 4 My Cause</b>. To thank you for your support at various levels we are offering the following to individual and corporate supporters:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b><i>Feed 10+ People In Need</i></b>  - 2,000 Supporters with a $10 Pledge would direct in their name a $2.50 donation to the Food Bank in their state.</span></li>

</ul>We have tried to create rewards that will extend our appreciation to individuals and corporations that partner with us in this funding effort. The gift cards can be used for a single gift card or we can send multiple gifts cards in whatever denominations requested.  In addition to being able to select from our wonderful offerings you will be further fulfilled knowing that 15% of the gift card value will be directed by YOU to the Cause or Organization of your choice.  </div><div>
<h3>There Are Always Challenges</h3>
<div>Building any business is full of challenges and PS It Matters is not an exception to that rule as we apply a social entrepreneurship business model to individual and corporate gifts.  The good news is that over the last 3 years we have invested more than $500,000 in building the infrastructure of the company so that it can now scale very easily.  What we have accomplished:</div>

<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Infrastructure of the business in
the form of system, process and procedures is fully deployed and proven as a

<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Launching of P4MC is underway and

</ul>
<div>All of this positions <b>Meals 4 Others</b> and <b>Purchasing 4 My Cause </b>for growth and is the core of our funding efforts.  Increasing awareness levels will result in more individual and corporate customers.  We are committed to making it happen and will continue to work tirelessly to prove this business model and the good it can do for all who purchase from us given that <b><i>""Every Purchase Supports Your Cause""!</i></b>

This was in response to many people celebrating our business model, but being frustrated that they could not use it to support Causes and Organizations that were important to them.  Purchasing 4 My Cause has been launched to support any and all community based effort (non-profit or not) that is makes a difference in our communities and our customers call it ""My Cause"".  Food Banks and Pantries can be selected, but now education, medical research (i.e. national or local cancer research organizations), church efforts, art organizations, and just about any effort to make our world a better place can be supported through individual or corporate purchases at Purchasing 4 My Cause.
We Can Give 15% Because We Do Not Market...Time to Market Our Message Is Now!
We are able to allow the 15% donation of our customers' purchase price to the Cause or Organization of THEIR CHOICE, by essentially eliminating the marketing costs of acquiring new customers via partnering with Non-profits and Corporations to ""spread the word"" about their exceptional results from purchasing items through Meals 4 Others and Purchasing 4 My Cause. Our customers share with other corporations in their communities the positive and grateful feedback received from gift recipients and the impact on their businesses of having partnered with a PS It Matters company.
While we ultimately believe that this successful referral-based model is the correct approach to grow the companies, prove profitability and positively impact so many communities, the time has come to get the word out by traditional marketing effort via print, direct mail and advertising!   Our Plans....Your Benefits...The Impact Great ideas are only great if people know about them and can embrace them.  Our steady growth over the last 3 years proves that when people are made aware of Meals 4 Others and Purchasing 4 My Cause, they will utilize us regularly for personal and corporate gifts, gear and marketing materials.  Because we believe we are very close to monthly profitability, we do not want to change the business model in any form.  We will utilize traditional marketing outreach to share with as many people as possible what they can do both individually and corporately--without spending an additional dime--to support their Causes/Organizations, their Communities and, as corporations, to truly set themselves apart from their competitors.
Because we are in an advanced start-up stage, the ability to spend any amount of funding on marketing efforts will make a huge impact on our ability to expand individual and corporate client base.  If we are able to meet our funding goal, double our funding goal or achieve 30% of our funding goal, each of these result would advance the presence of Meals 4 Others and Purchasing 4 My Cause in the general marketplace.  While important to all of us at PS It Matters, it has an incredible impact on the organizations that will receive donations directed through our expanded customer base.
We are now seeking your direct support of our efforts to change the world to be a better place with each purchase at Meals 4 Others and Purchasing 4 My Cause. To thank you for your support at various levels we are offering the following to individual and corporate supporters:


Feed 10+ People In Need  - 2,000 Supporters with a $10 Pledge would direct in their name a $2.50 donation to the Food Bank in their state.
High Five  - 200 Supporters with a $50 Pledge would receive a $40 Gift Card at Purchasing 4 My Cause.com.
Sending The Love - 200 Supporters with a $100 Pledge would receive a $75 Gift Card at Purchasing 4 My Cause.com and FREE SHIPPING on all items purchased with the Gift Card(s).

Good Friend - 200 Supporters with a $250 Pledge would receive a $175 Gift Card at Purchasing 4 My Cause.com and FREE SHIPPING on all items purchased with the Gift Card(s).

PS It Matters ""Family"" - 50 Supporters with a $1,000 Pledge would receive a $800 Gift Card at Purchasing 4 My Cause and FREE SHIPPING on all items purchased with the Gift Card(s).
PS It Matters ""Partner"" - 10 Supporters with a $5,000 Pledge would receive a $4,500 Gift Card at Purchasing 4 My Cause and FREE SHIPPING on all items purchased with the Gift Card(s).
We have tried to create rewards that will extend our appreciation to individuals and corporations that partner with us in this funding effort. The gift cards can be used for a single gift card or we can send multiple gifts cards in whatever denominations requested.  In addition to being able to select from our wonderful offerings you will be further fulfilled knowing that 15% of the gift card value will be directed by YOU to the Cause or Organization of your choice.  
There Are Always Challenges
Building any business is full of challenges and PS It Matters is not an exception to that rule as we apply a social entrepreneurship business model to individual and corporate gifts.  The good news is that over the last 3 years we have invested more than $500,000 in building the infrastructure of the company so that it can now scale very easily.  What we have accomplished:



The food and gift side of the
business is fully developed, proven and validated by our customers as comprised of quality offerings
that exceed expectations.
Clothing and Marketing offerings have
been fully developed and we have a good sense of exactly what customers want
and how it can be provided within a competitive and profitable pricing strategy.
We have a dozens of corporate
references that validate the positive impact this approach to providing gifts
has had on them personally as well as on their business.

Customer selection of a Cause or Organization of their choice (“Personal Donation Localization”) has proven to be a unique and very compelling feature of our general business model.

Reusable bags and other volume
programs that leverage our ability to “localize” and manage Cause-related
giving is a proven, profitable aspect of the PSIM business.
Infrastructure of the business in
the form of system, process and procedures is fully deployed and proven as a
valued asset of the business.
Launching of P4MC is underway and
prospects for this expanded approach have received widespread accolades from
our corporate and individual clients.
The management and operating team are proven and completely capable of doing it “all” on a day-to-day basis.  Our Technical and Development team continues to
improve and expand our operating systems capabilities to enable greater volume, increased offerings and improved efficiencies.

All of this positions Meals 4 Others and Purchasing 4 My Cause for growth and is the core of our funding efforts.  Increasing awareness levels will result in more individual and corporate customers.  We are committed to making it happen and will continue to work tirelessly to prove this business model and the good it can do for all who purchase from us given that ""Every Purchase Supports Your Cause""!




Other Ways You Can Help If the pledge approach does not work for you and you want to support our efforts...go on Meals 4 Others.com or Purchasing 4 My Cause.com and simply do some shopping and buy a gift.  Each purchase will support Your CAUSE and you will get...or send... some fantastic items with messaging declaring Your CAUSE!
If you are part of a corporation that sends appreciation, referral, holiday or other gifts, please encourage those in charge of making the gift decisions to reach out to us so we can share with them our corporate references and experiences.  Spread the word is all we ask!
The power of each of us to spread the word is amazing when applied.  If you cannot financially support us at this time, please make an effort to share this funding effort with others.  Encourage people you know to visit Meals 4 Others.com and Purchasing 4 My Cause.com to read about our efforts and see our offerings.  

Thank you for your time, consideration and support!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>The purpose of Miss Kitty's campaign is to expand business throughout the San Francisco Bay Area in the following revenue generating channels:</p>
<p>- product sales to local cafes, restaurants, and individual customers.</p>
<p>- online sales for shipment anywhere in the US.</p>

<h2>Food Source</h2>
<p>Most of all know that there is no better way to compliment a terrific meal than to add terrific ending, a great dessert.  In an area of devoted foodies people are constantly seeking out new and exciting foods and love to support small local business.  Miss Kitty likes to use local organic ingredients to make sure people get the best of the best.  We also import specific items from New Zealand like the golden syrup and Edmond's baking powder to keep our recipes as authentic as possible.   Since we use alot of eggs we definately support local free range egg suppliers from happy hens.  We are convinced that they just taste better and there yolks are a little brighter.  Soon to be a member of Marin Organic's.</p>
<h2>Now and the future</h2>
<p>Presently Miss Kitty is celebrating the America's Cup celebration in the Bay Area with her fellow Kiwi's.  This is a great opportunity to share and promote the food of New Zealand in every aspect.  Upon raising our goal the Miss Kitty crew will expand into all types of kitchen accessories ie aprons, tools, recipe books.  Also, upon being a part of the Farmers' Market community we will expand into jarred preservatives.  Preservatives would include jams, sauces, pickles and chutney's.</p>

<h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Julian Katz founder of Stasis Preserves cooked professionally in restaurants around the city then decided to strike out on my own. In 2010 a small start-up begun focusing on preserving locally grown foods and enabling the local, delicious, and healthy bounty to last all year. Re-connecting us to our roots, the way we used to eat. This endeavour became Stasis Preserves.</span></h3>
<h3>
<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Selling at The </span>St. Lawrence, Brickworks and Trinity Bellwoods Farmers' Markets<span style=""font-weight: normal;""> (and a few others) for the first growing season the business began to gain some ground. With the goal of supporting other small local producers, Julian decided to take the leap to open a small local foods shop. This became our production kitchen where we hand-make the preserves, as well as a community hub where people can find great local artisan foods. Stasis Preserves is now almost 3 years old and we are building a loyal fan base of enthusiasts who support the local food community. </span>

<h3><strong>WHY?</strong></h3>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">You should be able to access healthy local foods all year regardless of the weather outside. So we can enable local eating all year we need to produce a lot during the growing season. That's a large financial output all at once. Seasonal eating is delicious, healthy and honest. We want to enable people to access the foods they want. We want to help people support small farmers that are working hard to feed our cities and are up against huge industrial farms. </span></h3>
<h3>
<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">If each family contributed $10 a week into the local food system that would add </span>2.4 billion to our local economy<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">.</span>
</h3>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We are asking for $30,000 to help us make enough preserves to keep up with the demand. People want to eat local all year, we want to help them do just that. We have had three successful seasons but with the launch of our local foods store and extra costs we simply do not have the funds. </span></h3>

<h3><strong>FAQ</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>What makes your product so much more delicious and healthy?</strong></h3>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We preserve the produce fresh and at its height of ripeness. This creates a naturally more delicious taste. We use no artificial additives or preservatives, and have completely clean ingredients. Fruit &amp; Sugar and/or Vinegar and Spices. That's it. We are a fruit forward line, not loaded with sugar, letting you taste the fresh produce.</span></h3>
<h3><strong>How is it preserved without pectin or preservatives?</strong></h3>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Through the thorough research and development of our line we've gained all the knowledge and experience to keep everything preserved safely. You can keep our jars on the shelf for a year and a half, and once opened in the fridge for conservatively 4-6 weeks. Many last over two months. Avoid double dipping or leaving it out of the fridge for too long.</span></h3>
<h3><strong>What Flavours do you have?</strong></h3>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We have 7 core flavours: Raspberry, Blueberry, Strawberry Rhubarb, Red Wine Cherry, Caramelized Onion, Pear &amp; Roasted Garlic Spreads, and a Hot Sauce.</span></h3>
<h3><strong>Why are the called Spreads?</strong></h3>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The difference between Jams are Spreads is simply that our spreads contain less sugar than jams. Canadian laws state that a ""jam"" has to have at least 68% sugar. Our spreads have way less than that.</span></h3>
<h3>We call our spreads ""spreads"" on the label so they they are not mistaken for high sugar ""Jams"" or ""Preserves"" (65% sugar).</h3>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Our savoury spreads are similar to a ""chutney"" or a ""relish"" but the rules are too specific and don't apply to what we are making (for example a ""chutney"" must have at least 15% oil, ours has none).</span></h3>
<h3><strong>How do I choose my flavour?</strong></h3>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">After the campaign, we will send out a survey to ask which flavour(s) you would like. </span></h3>
<h3><strong>Is the product organic?</strong></h3>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Some of our produce is organic. Becoming certified organic is an expensive process many of our farmers are very small and simply cannot afford the legal certification. Most grow organically, but just aren't certified. We know how all of our produce is grown.</span></h3>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Chemicals are expensive, and farmers don't want to use them. Some spray only if absolutely necessary to save a crop, and there is always a regulated time before going to market that they cannot be sprayed. For example, carrots cannot be sprayed 2 months before being sold.</span></h3>
<h3><strong>How is the produce sourced?</strong></h3>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We build relationships with various small, local farmers through our farmer's markets. We talk to people, make connections, and talk about food!  We take trips to the farms to visit the people, taste the food, and see the practices the farmers use.</span></h3>
<h3><strong>How is the product made?</strong></h3>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Every jar is made my hand by Stasis staff and Julian himself in a certified commercial kitchen. This enables us to create a tightly quality controlled product. The product is cooked for a certain amount of time, until the texture and flavour is just right. We test the acidity and sugar levels for safely and consistency. We batch code our lots with best before dates and track all the details so the process is fully traceable and accountable. We can sleep well knowing that our products are safe, delicious and local.</span></h3>
<h3><strong>How will I get my Perk?</strong></h3>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We are excited to share our preserves with you! We will send out your perks by the end of September once every preserve has been re-stocked after the busy growing season.</span></h3>

Stasis is here to make Local, Seasonal, Delicious Eating Easy for You!
Our Preserves are: 
low/no sugar - no additives or preservatives - sourced seasonally from local farmers
 

Owner Julian and his sister Megan in Stasis' local foods shop
Julian Katz founder of Stasis Preserves cooked professionally in restaurants around the city then decided to strike out on my own. In 2010 a small start-up begun focusing on preserving locally grown foods and enabling the local, delicious, and healthy bounty to last all year. Re-connecting us to our roots, the way we used to eat. This endeavour became Stasis Preserves.

Selling at The St. Lawrence, Brickworks and Trinity Bellwoods Farmers' Markets (and a few others) for the first growing season the business began to gain some ground. With the goal of supporting other small local producers, Julian decided to take the leap to open a small local foods shop. This became our production kitchen where we hand-make the preserves, as well as a community hub where people can find great local artisan foods. Stasis Preserves is now almost 3 years old and we are building a loyal fan base of enthusiasts who support the local food community. 



We are certified by Foodland Ontario as a locally sourced and made product.

WHY?
You should be able to access healthy local foods all year regardless of the weather outside. So we can enable local eating all year we need to produce a lot during the growing season. That's a large financial output all at once. Seasonal eating is delicious, healthy and honest. We want to enable people to access the foods they want. We want to help people support small farmers that are working hard to feed our cities and are up against huge industrial farms. 

If each family contributed $10 a week into the local food system that would add 2.4 billion to our local economy.

We are asking for $30,000 to help us make enough preserves to keep up with the demand. People want to eat local all year, we want to help them do just that. We have had three successful seasons but with the launch of our local foods store and extra costs we simply do not have the funds. 
We want to build a sustainable business that can support itself, and the community. People want to eat locally, so we need your support to give you and everyone that option.
 
THE ONTARIO PRESERVES
 
With your help we hope to make enough of these delicious preserves to last until next year's growing season:
Ontario Strawberry Rhubarb, Fruit Spread with Ontario Cranberries
Ontario Raspberry, Fruit Spread with Ontario Cranberries
Ontario Blueberry, Fruit Spread with Ontario Cranberries
Ontario Red Wine and Cherries Spread
Ontario Caramelized Onion Spread
Ontario Pears and Roasted Garlic Spread
  

Why Your Help Matters:


You will be able to eat locally all year  


You will be supporting local farmers and enabling people to choose local food all year

Our preserves also do not contain:


any additives or artificial preservatives - we use only clean ingredients.


Support us, so Stasis can support you, your health, local eating, and small scale farming to keep us and our land healthy. It's about re-connecting to how we use to keep fresh produce in season all year. We want to help people re-think how they eat and re-connect us to the communities and flavours of our foods. We want to keep small farmers in business and limit our carbon footprint by sourcing from within our communities and province.

Stasis Preserves has been growing steadily. As we enter our fourth growing season we are striving to keep up with demand. We've simply hit a growing pain. This year we need to produce more than ever before, but we need your help to fund it.

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">
</span></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Overview:</b></p>
<p>Tipsi
was created to help simplify and enhance wine ordering
at restaurants. Our application aggregates, processes, and publishes restaurant wine list data to enable personalized and restaurant-specific recommendations to make wine drinking a straightforward, pleasurable, and memorable
experience.  </p>
<p>Tipsi
is fully integrated with Facebook, Twitter and Foursquare, ensuring users can
share their experiences, reviews, and preferences with friends and colleagues.
 We are focused on NYC, but plan to expand to other major cities as soon
as NYC is completed.  Is your favorite restaurant not processed by Tipsi
yet? Want to use Tipsi, but don't live in NYC? Simply upload images of a wine
list through the app if you want a local restaurant processed. <b> </b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Our
Story:</b></p>
<p>Tipsi
began as the hungover brunch project of three friends who wanted to democratize
wine enjoyment.  Recalling a wonderful dinner party we'd all been to the
night before, the next morning none of us could remember the name of the
amazing wine we'd enjoyed!  We wondered if this happened to everyone and
informally polled family, friends, foodies and aficionados and realized we were
not alone...many people have had a great wine and had no way to record and
retain that experience, let alone sort and share them. We
surveyed the wine app community and to our dismay found that all the existing
technologies were geared towards wine experts and collectors and not the normal
restaurant patron. As enthusiastic wine drinkers with diverse backgrounds in
technology and operations, we lacked any specialized wine
knowledge beyond knowing generally what we liked.  By chance, we were
introduced to world-renowned Sommelier Anani Lawson who joined us to build
a platform that compiles, stores, and indexes restaurant wine lists. This is
Tipsi, a revolutionary way for everyone from a casual consumer to a true
connoisseur to evaluate their palate, confidently discover new varieties, and
socially share exceptional wine experiences in a functional and unpretentious
way. </p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Why
Tipsi:</b></p>
<p>Wine
selection is personal, expensive, and extremely nuanced making it challenging and
stressful to the casual consumer. Restaurants take advantage of this by up
selling and cleverly structuring and pricing their wine lists to push higher
margin products to their benefit and not the consumer's. Tipsi came
to be because we as consumers were frustrated by the status quo. Wine is often
40%+ of a total dinner bill, yet it is the greatest unknown when consumers
need to make a purchase decision. Additionally, like preferences in art or
music, wine ""taste"" is completely unique from person-to-person. Depending
on your budget, wine familiarity, and specific location, you can receive a
recommendation that is personalized to you, your meal, and your
party. Tipsi empowers you to discover your unique virtual taste.</p></span><p></p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><p></p>

Overview:
Tipsi
was created to help simplify and enhance wine ordering
at restaurants. Our application aggregates, processes, and publishes restaurant wine list data to enable personalized and restaurant-specific recommendations to make wine drinking a straightforward, pleasurable, and memorable
experience.  
Tipsi
is fully integrated with Facebook, Twitter and Foursquare, ensuring users can
share their experiences, reviews, and preferences with friends and colleagues.
 We are focused on NYC, but plan to expand to other major cities as soon
as NYC is completed.  Is your favorite restaurant not processed by Tipsi
yet? Want to use Tipsi, but don't live in NYC? Simply upload images of a wine
list through the app if you want a local restaurant processed.  
Our
Story:
Tipsi
began as the hungover brunch project of three friends who wanted to democratize
wine enjoyment.  Recalling a wonderful dinner party we'd all been to the
night before, the next morning none of us could remember the name of the
amazing wine we'd enjoyed!  We wondered if this happened to everyone and
informally polled family, friends, foodies and aficionados and realized we were
not alone...many people have had a great wine and had no way to record and
retain that experience, let alone sort and share them. We
surveyed the wine app community and to our dismay found that all the existing
technologies were geared towards wine experts and collectors and not the normal
restaurant patron. As enthusiastic wine drinkers with diverse backgrounds in
technology and operations, we lacked any specialized wine
knowledge beyond knowing generally what we liked.  By chance, we were
introduced to world-renowned Sommelier Anani Lawson who joined us to build
a platform that compiles, stores, and indexes restaurant wine lists. This is
Tipsi, a revolutionary way for everyone from a casual consumer to a true
connoisseur to evaluate their palate, confidently discover new varieties, and
socially share exceptional wine experiences in a functional and unpretentious
way. 
Why
Tipsi:
Wine
selection is personal, expensive, and extremely nuanced making it challenging and
stressful to the casual consumer. Restaurants take advantage of this by up
selling and cleverly structuring and pricing their wine lists to push higher
margin products to their benefit and not the consumer's. Tipsi came
to be because we as consumers were frustrated by the status quo. Wine is often
40%+ of a total dinner bill, yet it is the greatest unknown when consumers
need to make a purchase decision. Additionally, like preferences in art or
music, wine ""taste"" is completely unique from person-to-person. Depending
on your budget, wine familiarity, and specific location, you can receive a
recommendation that is personalized to you, your meal, and your
party. Tipsi empowers you to discover your unique virtual taste.
Use of Proceeds:




Populate NYC wine lists (we have 13% of Manhattan and Brooklyn processed)


Add liquor store search and recommendations 

Add vendor portal for collection directly from restaurants, wineries and liquor stores
Stretch Goal - Add
additional cities beyond New York


Contact us directly for more information.
Risks:
Data Acquisition

Tipsi is still developing technology for local vendor search and acquisition
Tipsi is still developing technology to connect wineries directly with consumers, a key point to Tipsi's strategy  


Tipsi has a great team
addressing all of these challenges and will overcome them with help from you,

understand.  Chris and I, Leanne, always talked about adoption, even 
when we were dating.  See, it's not about rescuing a child from an 
orphanage and getting a pat on the back.  It's about seeing a need and 
meeting it with the desire we have to raise children.  We are able to 
conceive easily, we have two beautiful daughters, Haylee and Audrey.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/640342/files/20140610212618-Stephenson_Family_2014.JPG?1402460778"" src="""" style=""""/></p>But
 it breaks our hearts to know that there are children who will not even 
have a chance at having a family.  We do not promote pulling a child out
 of their home, no matter the poverty.  A family should ALWAYS stay 
together.  We are going through an agency that is reputable in both 
countries because they only adopt out children who are truly orphans and
 they work hard in each country to promote and help inter-country 
adoption and to sustain and grow healthy families.  The goal is to build
 healthy families around the world....and even if they are not healthy 
due to poverty, it is still not a reason to deem those child ""orphans."" 
 <br/><p>Orphans are the children who have been abandoned, whose 
parents have died, who are given up because the parent(s) knows they 
cannot care for them and it was their decision to make, or, in many 
cases, the child is a result of rape and the mom feels it is too painful
 to keep that baby.</p><p>God doesn't look at genes.  Over and over He 
speaks of adopting us as His own.  He loves us like He loves His Son, 
Jesus Christ, when we choose to accept His gift of forgiveness, grace 
and mercy and redemption He offered us by Jesus' death on the cross and 
resurrection.  He writes to us that there is no longer a difference 
between Jew and Gentile, we are all loved equally when we become His 
children. I am that Gentile who is loved, thank you Jesus. <br/></p><p>So,
 in faith, recognizing that adoption is a beautiful, hard, long, forever
 journey, we are trusting and already feel that our next two children, 
one adopted from Haiti and one from Ethiopia, will have just as much a 
place in our hearts and home as our two daughters.  We tell people often
 that God has placed this so much on our minds and hearts that it is 
more normal for us to plan our family in this way than to get pregnant 
with our next two.  We have seen other friends choose this same path and
 we know that God has directed us to do the same.</p><p>Why two?  Well, 
the journey started with just one adoption from Ethiopia two years ago. 
 But the waiting time has gotten longer and our paperwork just sits in 
the embassy, and therefore the stretch in age between our youngest 
daughter and our next baby from there is increasing.  We thought that 
maybe we would want four children and as time has dragged on and Haiti's
 requirements on a family for adopting opened up more to us we thought 
maybe we would adopt from there after we brought our baby home from 
Ethiopia.  But, we were advised by our agency that the time it would 
take to bring a child from Haiti would probably fit into the time we are
 waiting for our child from Ethiopia.  (As a side note, the children are
 not picked out.  We will know who they are after they are referred to 
us by our agency.)</p><p>So, we are ""concurrently adopting"".  We are 
adopting internationally simply because we love different cultures and 
know it would not be an issue to incorporate that into our daily lives 
and because we know that the situation is dire in many of the orphanages
 over in both countries.  Thankfully our agency moves the children (when
 they have been thoroughly investigated and found to be actual orphans) 
from those orphanages to a healthy transition home.  Both countries do 
not have a well-functioning foster care system like we do here.  We have
 many friends fostering here in the states and we have friends adopting 
domestically and we have friends in our position.  All families are 
called to help in the way they feel God has led them so that all areas 
of need are covered.</p>We are doing as much as we can on a youth 
pastor's salary and my part-time jobs to provide for these adoptions.  
Most of Ethiopia's cost ($35,000) had already been provided, saved and 
fundraised but then the decision to adopt from Haiti was made and we 
have started all over again.  Some money can be switched from our 
Ethiopian adoption to Haiti but some cannot.  Haiti costs can range 
anywhere from $28,000 to $38,000 (trust us, when you see all the fees 
laid out for adoption you understand why they cost so much, IT MAKES 
SENSE!).  We need much of this money within the next year because this 
adoption will progress so fast.  By next year we will be visiting our 
toddler and a year later we will bring them home.<br/><br/>$2 can be spent on so little....in our family it's a box of Timbit 
donuts or Haylee's lunch at school or a tip for the kids drying off my

understand.  Chris and I, Leanne, always talked about adoption, even 
when we were dating.  See, it's not about rescuing a child from an 
orphanage and getting a pat on the back.  It's about seeing a need and 
meeting it with the desire we have to raise children.  We are able to 
conceive easily, we have two beautiful daughters, Haylee and Audrey.But
 it breaks our hearts to know that there are children who will not even 
have a chance at having a family.  We do not promote pulling a child out
 of their home, no matter the poverty.  A family should ALWAYS stay 
together.  We are going through an agency that is reputable in both 
countries because they only adopt out children who are truly orphans and
 they work hard in each country to promote and help inter-country 
adoption and to sustain and grow healthy families.  The goal is to build
 healthy families around the world....and even if they are not healthy 
due to poverty, it is still not a reason to deem those child ""orphans."" 
 Orphans are the children who have been abandoned, whose 
parents have died, who are given up because the parent(s) knows they 
cannot care for them and it was their decision to make, or, in many 
cases, the child is a result of rape and the mom feels it is too painful
 to keep that baby.God doesn't look at genes.  Over and over He 
speaks of adopting us as His own.  He loves us like He loves His Son, 
Jesus Christ, when we choose to accept His gift of forgiveness, grace 
and mercy and redemption He offered us by Jesus' death on the cross and 
resurrection.  He writes to us that there is no longer a difference 
between Jew and Gentile, we are all loved equally when we become His 
children. I am that Gentile who is loved, thank you Jesus. So,
 in faith, recognizing that adoption is a beautiful, hard, long, forever
 journey, we are trusting and already feel that our next two children, 
one adopted from Haiti and one from Ethiopia, will have just as much a 
place in our hearts and home as our two daughters.  We tell people often
 that God has placed this so much on our minds and hearts that it is 
more normal for us to plan our family in this way than to get pregnant 
with our next two.  We have seen other friends choose this same path and
 we know that God has directed us to do the same.Why two?  Well, 
the journey started with just one adoption from Ethiopia two years ago. 
 But the waiting time has gotten longer and our paperwork just sits in 
the embassy, and therefore the stretch in age between our youngest 
daughter and our next baby from there is increasing.  We thought that 
maybe we would want four children and as time has dragged on and Haiti's
 requirements on a family for adopting opened up more to us we thought 
maybe we would adopt from there after we brought our baby home from 
Ethiopia.  But, we were advised by our agency that the time it would 
take to bring a child from Haiti would probably fit into the time we are
 waiting for our child from Ethiopia.  (As a side note, the children are
 not picked out.  We will know who they are after they are referred to 
us by our agency.)So, we are ""concurrently adopting"".  We are 
adopting internationally simply because we love different cultures and 
know it would not be an issue to incorporate that into our daily lives 
and because we know that the situation is dire in many of the orphanages
 over in both countries.  Thankfully our agency moves the children (when
 they have been thoroughly investigated and found to be actual orphans) 
from those orphanages to a healthy transition home.  Both countries do 
not have a well-functioning foster care system like we do here.  We have
 many friends fostering here in the states and we have friends adopting 
domestically and we have friends in our position.  All families are 
called to help in the way they feel God has led them so that all areas 
of need are covered.We are doing as much as we can on a youth 
pastor's salary and my part-time jobs to provide for these adoptions.  
Most of Ethiopia's cost ($35,000) had already been provided, saved and 
fundraised but then the decision to adopt from Haiti was made and we 
have started all over again.  Some money can be switched from our 
Ethiopian adoption to Haiti but some cannot.  Haiti costs can range 
anywhere from $28,000 to $38,000 (trust us, when you see all the fees 
laid out for adoption you understand why they cost so much, IT MAKES 
SENSE!).  We need much of this money within the next year because this 
adoption will progress so fast.  By next year we will be visiting our 
toddler and a year later we will bring them home.$2 can be spent on so little....in our family it's a box of Timbit 
donuts or Haylee's lunch at school or a tip for the kids drying off my 
van after a car wash.  But would you consider donating $2, one for each 
child? Would you consider retweeting our story or sharing it on Facebook
 so that others could give just their $2?  With the money we can use 
from our Ethiopian adoption we need about another $15,000 more in the next coming year but for now we are starting with $6,000.    We don't believe every family  is called to adopt because it is all consuming and a different journey than getting pregnant and giving birth.  But the Bible does tell us to care for widows and orphans.  I recently watched a girl I have mentored for 5 years, her three younger siblings and their father, bury their mom and wife.  Our hearts are so compelled to care for this widowed father and his family.  Our hearts are compelled to care for two legitimate orphans by bringing them into our home and loving them as our own, as God does for us today and every day forward.  Would $2 be one of the ways you can do James 1:27?(And, of course, it doesn't have to be just $2, but that could go without saying...)www.stephensonadoptionjourney.blogspot.com",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Erin Brioso, and I am the current President of Making Lives Better at Rollins College in Winter Park, Florida. Making Lives Better the organization is a family. It's my family, and it's a family all over the world. Whether it's Nepal or our own backyard in Orlando, our greatest desire is to do just what our name suggests-- but specifically in the capacities of Health and Education. I have been involved with MLB since my first year at Rollins in 2010. </p>
<p>Making Lives Better, also known as MLB, was founded in 2009 as a student led service organization at Rollins College. Its mission is to improve the lives of people in rural communities around the world in the impact areas of Health and Education. Our vision is of a world where access to health and educational resources are the solution to better lives. Over the past four of years MLB has maintained its focus on Nepal and we are planning to have our fourth service trip in the summer of 2014. In those 4 years we have raised over $75K with the generous support of our college. But we cannot continue to rely on our incredible school to help us achieve our goals. We need YOUR help. </p>
<p>Having reached over 4,000 people in four years, we believe that our Health Camps, Educational Outreaches, and Water Purification projects (Mission Aqua) are imperative to the quality of life for many people throughout Nepal. </p>
<p>This campaign is meant to fund the majority of our Educational Outreach. Every year at Rollins we hold 3 large fundraisers, but that simply is not enough anymore. Over the last four years our educational efforts have increased school enrollments by 30 % and reduced incidence of water-borne disease affecting children in a significant way. Your contributions would effectively help us sponsor 5 orphaned girls to be able to attend school, as well as provide a year's worth of school supplies as well as improvements in technology equipment at a Public Primary school in a rural village in Nepal. </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $15,000 to effectively reach our goals for this years Educational Outreach Project! We will be sponsoring 5 orphaned girls school tuition and housing for the year. We need exactly $5,000 to do this. The ""Sponsored a Future..."" donors are absolutely essential for this.  </p>
<p>Horace Mann is known as the ""Father of Education"" in the United States. He was an Educational reformist, and he is responsible for establishing a Public School system in America. The ""Horace Mann"" donor is of critical importance to our endeavors because like he argued, ""access to a Public Education is a nation's best way to ensure a society of disciplined judicious, active citizens.""</p>
<p>Unfortunately, if we do not meet our goals for the Educational Outreach projects we will be unable to achieve the full potential for contributing to the status of Education in Nepal over our 3 week service trip. Many people are opposed to the idea that people should interfere with the status of other nations development-- and we see that point. We are not doing that at all, we are simply assisting people in rural Nepal to have a better chance at achieving their own full potential-- and the way to do that is through a good education and the means by which they can achieve that. </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In the past four years that Making Lives Better has existed, we have reached over 1,000 people in rural villages in Nepal, raised over $75K to achieve our endeavors, as well as sharing meals, perspectives, culture, and love to countless people. Having now established 3 other branches of MLB at colleges around the United States, we feel the only place to go from here is up! Our goal is to keep assisting to provide better access to Health and Educational resouces to people in rural communities around the world in order to make lives better. You can be apart of that. You can make a difference-- even if it's by spreading the word. Every child and adult deserves a trip to the dentist or a general physician, and every human being deserves access to clean water; every child deserves to receive an education-- no matter the circumstance.</p>
<p>This project is valuable to you, the contributor because it only takes one person to make a difference. Whether its through a simple smile, a word of encouragement, or through a monetary donation-- you can be the one to make a difference. </p>

back when businesses, schools, and church memberships thrived, and civil rights
leaders, including the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., called this place home.
These days, however, the neighborhood faces high unemployment, drug problems,
record foreclosure rates, and the after-effects of natural disasters, including
a major flood and tornado.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">But within this blighted community is a smaller community
offering hope and healing to homeless and low-income individuals, including
veterans. Located on Rock Street, Quest Community Development Organization (formerly known as Quest 35 Inc.),  was
founded by Leonard Adams in 2001. The Gulf War veteran and former entrepreneur
turned his talents to the nonprofit world when he realized the need to help
chronically homeless and drug-addicted individuals in the area.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">To date, his organization has assisted more than 4,000
individuals with supportive housing. Quest properties include renovated and new
apartment buildings, a housing complex, and a two-story headquarter building on
Rock Street, a tidy cul-de-sac off of Joseph E. Lowery Boulevard.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Among these safe havens is Quest Veterans Village, a 12-unit
garden-style apartment building housing disabled veteran men and women. Two
years after it opened in 2011, Adams took another look at the property and
discovered its residents had no place to come together outdoors.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">This fall, <i style="""">CL’</i>s
Do Good Campaign is teaming up with Adams’ nonprofit to create an outdoor
gathering space for veterans, complete with seating and new plantings,
including flowers and decorative grasses. Renovations will begin mid-fall and a
volunteer day for planting is scheduled soon after the Thanksgiving holiday. As
part of <i style="""">Creative Loafing</i>’s
Do Good Campaign — a series of grassroots partnerships with various local neighborhoods
and nonprofits — the Atlanta-based news organization is working with Quest to
raise $2,500 to help fund the greenspace project. Do Good sponsor the Home
Depot Foundation will match donations dollar for dollar up to $2,500.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The resulting $5,000 will enable Quest Veterans Village to
build a dedicated outdoor seating area and garden for residents. It will also
honor the soldiers and their service as they re-establish themselves within a deserving
Atlanta community.</p>

offering hope and healing to homeless and low-income individuals, including
veterans. Located on Rock Street, Quest Community Development Organization (formerly known as Quest 35 Inc.),  was
founded by Leonard Adams in 2001. The Gulf War veteran and former entrepreneur
turned his talents to the nonprofit world when he realized the need to help
chronically homeless and drug-addicted individuals in the area.
To date, his organization has assisted more than 4,000
individuals with supportive housing. Quest properties include renovated and new
apartment buildings, a housing complex, and a two-story headquarter building on
Rock Street, a tidy cul-de-sac off of Joseph E. Lowery Boulevard.
Among these safe havens is Quest Veterans Village, a 12-unit
garden-style apartment building housing disabled veteran men and women. Two
years after it opened in 2011, Adams took another look at the property and
discovered its residents had no place to come together outdoors.
This fall, CL’s
Do Good Campaign is teaming up with Adams’ nonprofit to create an outdoor
gathering space for veterans, complete with seating and new plantings,
including flowers and decorative grasses. Renovations will begin mid-fall and a
volunteer day for planting is scheduled soon after the Thanksgiving holiday. As
part of Creative Loafing’s
Do Good Campaign — a series of grassroots partnerships with various local neighborhoods
and nonprofits — the Atlanta-based news organization is working with Quest to
raise $2,500 to help fund the greenspace project. Do Good sponsor the Home
Depot Foundation will match donations dollar for dollar up to $2,500.
The resulting $5,000 will enable Quest Veterans Village to
build a dedicated outdoor seating area and garden for residents. It will also
honor the soldiers and their service as they re-establish themselves within a deserving
Atlanta community.

<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 30px;"">Homeless in Ithaca</span><br/></p>
<p>Ithaca, NY is a small sophisticated and progressive city, but behind a few buildings downtown, the ""Ithaca Jungle"" was a continuous encampment of homeless men and women year-round for decades – until last Christmas.  Up until that point, Carmen Guidi was a self-made auto-body-shop owner living for himself in the Newfield hills and doing the ""right thing"" but not really caring for others. His life began to change as he read a book, went to Haiti, met a homeless man who committed suicide, then dedicated himself (and his finances) to giving the local homeless a place to live with dignity.</p>
<p>As the last 6 men in the Jungle became willing or desperate to leave that place in the deepening cold of winter, Carmen bought heated camping trailers one by one and hooked them up to water and electricity on his own land to give them housing. The Ithaca Jungle became empty just before Christmas 2012. Right now, all of those men are still living in the campers and Carmen relates to them as a friend. This year Carmen heard the call to build a village of tiny cottages, and he donated 7 acres of beautiful land behind his business (on the bus route) for that purpose.</p>
<p>The long-term vision of Second Wind Cottages is to build up to 18 tiny and separate 16x20' cottages in 3 phases to transition men from homelessness to renewed lives in the community. This fall the first 6 are being built. Volunteers and skilled professionals have rallied to get that done, and donations by local contractors and building suppliers have been generous and amazing!</p>
<p>We've raised $49,300 privately so far, but will need a total of $90,000 to $120,000 to finish the work. Local people, businesses, and churches are helping generously and we're working hard to finish the interiors by December 1st, but we need more help to finish the work.</p>
<p>As we launch this campaign, the Ithaca Jungle is almost empty again for the second winter in a row. That's a reflection of the new reality that 6 formerly long-term-homeless men are no longer among Ithaca's homeless.  We want to build these cottages as a transition and pathway out of homelessness... helping 6 men, then 6 more, and 6 more after that.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/154587/files/20131025125652-indiegogo-graphics-05.png?1382731012"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Phase One: Six Tiny Heated Cottages<br/>
</h3>
<p>Exteriors of 6 cottages are almost done and the interior work has begun.  They will feature:<br/></p>
<ul>
<li>a total living space of 16x20' including a full kitchen and bath<br/>
</li>
<li>donated furniture which the men can take with them to their next apartment<br/>
</li>
<li>one of the best views of the hills surrounding Ithaca (really, it's true)<br/>
</li>
<li>(and after Phase II) a large ""common building"" for group events, recreation and laundry<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Vision: Homes and Friendship<br/>
</h3>
<p>Carmen first met the men of the Jungle by bringing them pizza and blankets, and the difference was he kept going back. As each man decided to accept it, Carmen helped some into medical care, some into rehab, some into regular apartments and jobs, and he kept investing in the relationships. Now those same men have begun to help each other.</p>
<p>The ultimate vision includes offering life-skills training, personal goal-setting, vocational and financial coaching, and open-ended 1-on-1 friendship. Each man is different, so each one will have a different path to health and progress. This is not a meant to be a program, it's a meant to be a relationship.<br/></p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 30px;"">How You Can Help</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>We need funds now in order to finish the cottages by our target date of December 1st. With almost 100% donated labor, we estimate the cost of each cottage will be around $15,000 (with around $30,000 added to the total for environmental site work) — an amazing price for what'll be achieved in men's lives! Some lives have been saved from medical crises already!  We need your help to:<br/></p>
<ul>
<li>ask friends to get the word out and make some noise about this project<br/>
</li>
<li>come to the worksite to help us build any Saturday (if you live near the Ithaca area)</li>
<li>give what you can financially to help buy materials<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Together, we can end homelessness in Ithaca one life at a time.</p>

Homeless in Ithaca
Ithaca, NY is a small sophisticated and progressive city, but behind a few buildings downtown, the ""Ithaca Jungle"" was a continuous encampment of homeless men and women year-round for decades – until last Christmas.  Up until that point, Carmen Guidi was a self-made auto-body-shop owner living for himself in the Newfield hills and doing the ""right thing"" but not really caring for others. His life began to change as he read a book, went to Haiti, met a homeless man who committed suicide, then dedicated himself (and his finances) to giving the local homeless a place to live with dignity.
As the last 6 men in the Jungle became willing or desperate to leave that place in the deepening cold of winter, Carmen bought heated camping trailers one by one and hooked them up to water and electricity on his own land to give them housing. The Ithaca Jungle became empty just before Christmas 2012. Right now, all of those men are still living in the campers and Carmen relates to them as a friend. This year Carmen heard the call to build a village of tiny cottages, and he donated 7 acres of beautiful land behind his business (on the bus route) for that purpose.
The long-term vision of Second Wind Cottages is to build up to 18 tiny and separate 16x20' cottages in 3 phases to transition men from homelessness to renewed lives in the community. This fall the first 6 are being built. Volunteers and skilled professionals have rallied to get that done, and donations by local contractors and building suppliers have been generous and amazing!
We've raised $49,300 privately so far, but will need a total of $90,000 to $120,000 to finish the work. Local people, businesses, and churches are helping generously and we're working hard to finish the interiors by December 1st, but we need more help to finish the work.
As we launch this campaign, the Ithaca Jungle is almost empty again for the second winter in a row. That's a reflection of the new reality that 6 formerly long-term-homeless men are no longer among Ithaca's homeless.  We want to build these cottages as a transition and pathway out of homelessness... helping 6 men, then 6 more, and 6 more after that.



Phase One: Six Tiny Heated Cottages

Exteriors of 6 cottages are almost done and the interior work has begun.  They will feature:

a total living space of 16x20' including a full kitchen and bath

donated furniture which the men can take with them to their next apartment

one of the best views of the hills surrounding Ithaca (really, it's true)

(and after Phase II) a large ""common building"" for group events, recreation and laundry


The Vision: Homes and Friendship

Carmen first met the men of the Jungle by bringing them pizza and blankets, and the difference was he kept going back. As each man decided to accept it, Carmen helped some into medical care, some into rehab, some into regular apartments and jobs, and he kept investing in the relationships. Now those same men have begun to help each other.
The ultimate vision includes offering life-skills training, personal goal-setting, vocational and financial coaching, and open-ended 1-on-1 friendship. Each man is different, so each one will have a different path to health and progress. This is not a meant to be a program, it's a meant to be a relationship.

How You Can Help

We need funds now in order to finish the cottages by our target date of December 1st. With almost 100% donated labor, we estimate the cost of each cottage will be around $15,000 (with around $30,000 added to the total for environmental site work) — an amazing price for what'll be achieved in men's lives! Some lives have been saved from medical crises already!  We need your help to:

ask friends to get the word out and make some noise about this project

come to the worksite to help us build any Saturday (if you live near the Ithaca area)
give what you can financially to help buy materials


Together, we can end homelessness in Ithaca one life at a time.

<h3>Hello! My name is Anita Parker, and I became a raw vegan chef as a way to help the members of my community, learn ways to thrive in life, rather than just survive.</h3>
<h3>My goal is to teach, and empower others to take control of their health.</h3>
<h3>Fermented foods are known to be the key to a healthy digestive system and immunity. Studies show that kimchi is effective in fighting viral infections, reduces inflammation, and may be a potential cancer fighter.</h3>

<h3>I am so passionate about providing this to the community. It can help improve our residents health, and also supports the local farmers.</h3>
<h3>Blessings to anyone who can help me with funding to obtain the necessary permits, and licenses to be able to prepare this kimchi, and put it on the market.</h3>

<p><strong>Making the Shift from Grunge to Green</strong></p>
<p>FIC has been in the business of promoting cooperative culture for <strong>25 years</strong>. The first decade we operated out of Board members' bedrooms and ""virtual"" offices. Then a supportive group donated an unused house trailer. We hauled that to <a href=""http://www.sandhillfarm.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sandhill Farm</a> and set it up as our first permanent office. For the last 15 we've made do with that flimsy '70s era facility that's bitter cold in January and sweltering hot in July. Enough is enough.</p>
<p>Last year the Board made the commitment to establish decent working conditions for our growing operations, and our first choice is to relocate to <a href=""http://www.dancingrabbit.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dancing Rabbit</a>, a thriving ecovillage of 70 adults on the way to hundreds, located just three miles away. As one of the foremost ecovillages in the world, Dancing Rabbit is effectively creating a truly sustainable village! Read stats here on the dramatic resource use reduction: <a href=""http://www.dancingrabbit.org/resource-use-average-american-vs-dancing-rabbit-2011"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.dancingrabbit.org/resource-use-average-american-vs-dancing-rabbit-2011</a>.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why does FIC need a new office?</strong> The old one is falling apart, very difficult to maintain decent working conditions, and barely protects our inventory.</p>
<p><br/>The new energy-efficient, Green building we aspire to construct will have many advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>much larger pool of prospective staff.</li>
<li>more convenient for staff to do short shifts, which translates to more prompt service (a short walk instead of a three-mile bike ride).</li>
<li>synergistic visits: people coming to DR will also get to see FIC; people drawn to FIC will get DR as a bonus (and DR already gets hundreds of visitors each year!)</li>
<li>possibility of office interns who can readily find temporary housing at DR. This will help us undertake special projects economically while at the same time bring new blood into the organization.</li>
<li>better organization of resource files.</li>
<li>better preservation of materials.</li>
<li>meeting space for FIC Board and staff.</li>
<li>much better atmosphere control=better staff morale.</li>

Making the Shift from Grunge to Green
FIC has been in the business of promoting cooperative culture for 25 years. The first decade we operated out of Board members' bedrooms and ""virtual"" offices. Then a supportive group donated an unused house trailer. We hauled that to Sandhill Farm and set it up as our first permanent office. For the last 15 we've made do with that flimsy '70s era facility that's bitter cold in January and sweltering hot in July. Enough is enough.
Last year the Board made the commitment to establish decent working conditions for our growing operations, and our first choice is to relocate to Dancing Rabbit, a thriving ecovillage of 70 adults on the way to hundreds, located just three miles away. As one of the foremost ecovillages in the world, Dancing Rabbit is effectively creating a truly sustainable village! Read stats here on the dramatic resource use reduction: http://www.dancingrabbit.org/resource-use-average-american-vs-dancing-rabbit-2011.
                   CLICK TO WATCH THE VIDEO >                               
               

 
Why does FIC need a new office? The old one is falling apart, very difficult to maintain decent working conditions, and barely protects our inventory.
The new energy-efficient, Green building we aspire to construct will have many advantages:

much larger pool of prospective staff.
more convenient for staff to do short shifts, which translates to more prompt service (a short walk instead of a three-mile bike ride).
synergistic visits: people coming to DR will also get to see FIC; people drawn to FIC will get DR as a bonus (and DR already gets hundreds of visitors each year!)
possibility of office interns who can readily find temporary housing at DR. This will help us undertake special projects economically while at the same time bring new blood into the organization.
better organization of resource files.
better preservation of materials.
meeting space for FIC Board and staff.
much better atmosphere control=better staff morale.

Here's our budgetExpenses800 square foot energy efficient office with furnishings         $90,000IncomeIndiegogo campaign                                                     $45,000*Major donors support & Foundation Grants                         $45,000If everyone who's contacted us for information about cooperative living in the last 25 years gives only $1 each, we'll make our goal for this campaign.
*NOTE: It is fine for us to exceed this goal and we're happy to share more perks if we decide to keep raising more of the funds through this campaign!
 
What You'll Get...
Over the last quarter century FIC has proven our ability to promote community and provide a hungry public with up-to-date and comprehensive information about who's doing what and where. Now we need your help to keep helping you and all those who will follow, looking for cooperative alternatives. 
For supporting this campaign, you'll receive some of that inspiration and information as our gift, including...
               
 
      ...and more!  View more perks over here ----->
        If we're successful, FIC will have the greenest                              building in the state of Missouri!

<h3>Welcome to Silicon Allee</h3>
<p><strong>Who are we?</strong></p>
<p>We are Silicon Allee, the only independent and community-driven tech news source in Berlin, and Germany's biggest startup network.</p>
<p>We are an organic and authentic part of a scene which we helped create - and at our core we have: </p>
<ul>
<li>Editorial independence</li>
<li>Authenticity</li>
<li>Quality journalism</li>
<li>Outstanding content</li>
<li>Berlin's most valuable international network of high influencers</li>
</ul>
<p><em>There is no company behind us; we are organically grown and completely community-driven. Think of us as the PBS or BBC of the tech media in Germany.</em></p>
<p><img alt=""The best way for us to meet the needs of the startup community is to remain independent - and for that, we need your help."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://siliconallee.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/big-message.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>What do we want to achieve?</strong></p>
<p>We want to expand – to become bigger and better and provide more community- and business-orientated benefits.</p>
<p><strong>Why are you running a crowdfunding campaign?</strong></p>
<p>As an independent English-language tech news site in Germany, we are fulfilling a major need. Startup people, be they entrepreneur, investor, programmer or marketing guru, need to be able to read, discuss and disseminate ideas and the latest innovations in a language they understand. As most foreigners who come to Berlin trying to get their business off the ground do not speak German, we have made it our mission to make the market more easily accessible for them.</p>
<p><strong>How will we accomplish our goals?</strong></p>
<p>We want to invest in our editorial team to find the hottest new journalistic talent, expand our coverage and reach more people with what is happening in the startup scene in Berlin and across Germany every single day. This will include exploring the ever-growing connections between Berlin's lifestyle scene and the tech community.</p>
<p>We will also work with our partners in education and event-hosting to help push one of the world's fastest-growing startup hubs.</p>
<p><strong>What do we want from you?</strong></p>
<p>We need more resources to realise our ambitions and help support the tech community in Germany to an even greater degree! The money we raise in this campaign will help us improve our platform as we implement a sustainable business model including ad sales, sponsorships, custom networking events and PR/media consultancy which will allow us to maintain our independence in the long run. Specifically, we are looking for funding for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>€7,500 for expanding and improving our editorial team</em></li>
</ul>
<p>We want to discover the best freelance content out there. The money will be invested into a six-month program to fund content from professional sources, both up-and-coming and experienced, to give a new take on the tech and startup scene in Berlin and Germany. This program will give us the chance to not only introduce some fresh voices, but to plan ahead for the expansion of our full-time editorial team later this year. </p>
<ul>
<li><em>€7,500 for diversifying our event schedule</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Following on from the success of our original breakfast meet up and other events – including a <a href=""http://hackdt.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">major international hackathon</a> – we want to establish bigger and better events, something which needs more resources. We need the funding to secure the coolest venues, hire the biggest DJs and cater for our guests in the best way possible. The goal is to put on an extra event a month for a year using this money.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>€5,000 for a comprehensive, regularly updated Berlin startup directory</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Everything will be in here - the companies, the people, the deals. In addition, this section will include a series of How To guides for entrepreneurs. This directory will provide a vital one-stop source of information which many people in Berlin and across Germany have repeatedly been asking for. The money will be spent on logging and checking the information, writing the directory copy and programming and hosting the site. </p>
<ul>
<li><em>€5,000 to build a unique startup job network</em></li>
</ul>
<p>This will include improving and fostering links between the many universities in Berlin and the digital industry to tap into the enormous student pool of talent, as well as establishing and promoting job fairs not only for students but for everyone involved in startups.</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong><em> </em></p>
<p>We founded Silicon Allee in February 2011 as a way of bringing together people from Berlin's startup scene, which was then just beginning to blossom. Starting out as a monthly meet up, we quickly saw the need for an English-language tech blog from Berlin, about Berlin. After all, how could people around the world discover what was happening here if all the coverage was in German?</p>
<p>Four months later, we launched the <a href=""http://siliconallee.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Siliconallee.com</a> website, and since then we have been a uniquely independent tech community in Berlin. After sourcing a small amount of starting-up investment, we are still almost completely owned by our original founders and remain committed to our organically-built community.</p>
<p>Our Editor-in-Chief is David Knight, a born-and-bred Londoner who has lived in Berlin since 2006. He has worked for major online German news portals including <a href=""http://www.bild.de/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bild.de</a>, where he helped set up and run innovative Second Life-based publication The AvaStar and English-language platform Bild.com, and <a href=""http://www.spiegel.de/international/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Spiegel International</a>. His background in both traditional British newspapers and modern online publishing, together with his extensive experience of Berlin and what makes it tick, gives him a unique perspective when it comes to the growing tech scene in the city.</p>
<p>Since we started, Silicon Allee has become a byword for the Berlin startup scene outside of Germany - hence we have attracted much media attention from outlets including Berliner Morgenpost, New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Le Monde, Swedish Radio, Deutschland Radio Wissen, WDR, Monocle, Die Welt, Bild, Spiegel and many more. </p>
<p>And it's not just Silicon Allee that the world is sitting up and taking note of - many of the startups which we have helped to find an audience have gone on to make a name for themselves on a global scale, mirroring Berlin as it continues its progress towards becoming a genuine world city.</p>
<p>Companies like <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">SoundCloud</a>, <a href=""http://www.eyeem.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">EyeEm</a>, <a href=""http://upcload.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">UPcload</a>, <a href=""http://www.twago.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">twago</a> and <a href=""http://www.getvamos.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Vamos</a> may be in different stages of development, but they all form part of Berlin's future; a future which is distinctly digital.</p>
<p><img alt=""President Gauck at the Factory"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://siliconallee.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/factory_president_mayor_group.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>And Germany is starting to sit up and take notice. The country's President, Joachim Gauck, joined the Mayor of Berlin Klaus Wowereit on a tour of the <a href=""http://www.factoryberlin.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Factory</a>, a tech hub currently under construction alongside the former route of the Berlin Wall, and where Silicon Allee already has its headquarters. German Chancellor <a href=""http://siliconallee.com/editorial/2013/03/08/merkel-dazzles-startup-crowd-but-stops-short-of-major-change"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Angela Merkel"">Angela Merkel</a> and her deputy, <a href=""http://siliconallee.com/editorial/2013/03/15/we-are-counting-on-you-rosler-hits-the-right-notes-at-scb"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Philipp Rösler"">Philipp Rösler</a>, have also pledged their support to the emerging digital economy.</p>
<p>Things are getting better - but Berlin has plenty of growing to do as a tech hub. As a loudspeaker telling the world about what's going on here, we are helping to bring in investors and attention from Silicon Valley, New York, London and elsewhere.</p>

This money will go towards any expenses incurred by this tragic event including but not limited to Lynne's travel and accommodation to Kelowna, costs related to Vincent's care and recovery as well as any other specific needs Vincent and his family may have.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Sadly, I know all too well the emotional, financial and psychological impact a tragedy of this magnitude can have on a person and their family. Vincent was a very close friend of my husband who passed away in a motor vehicle accident in 2006. My brother who was also in the accident, was placed in critical condition and spent weeks in hospital. I was fortunate to have people like Lynne and Vincent during this time as they both made substantial efforts to support our families and help my brother pull through.</p>
<p>By providing some financial support for Vincent, it will allow Lynne and the rest of Vincent's family to focus more on what matters the most - helping Vincent get better.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>If donating money is not a possibly at this time, you can also help by spreading the word as much as you can to others who you believe would like to contribute.</p>
<p>Every contribution, positive thought and encouraging message makes a difference. </p>
<p>Thank you and much love to Vincent.</p>

My name is Rachel Sanchez and I am a friend of Vince and his Mother Lynne. It has been amazing to see how many people have come together to show their love and support during this difficult time.
As most of you know, Vince was in a plane crash on Monday August 13th and is currently in critical condition in Kelowna. His mother Lynne, along with other close friends and family have been tirelessly at his side while he goes through his surgeries and remains in induced coma.

</div></div>","Our Story

Guru Signal is a local, crowd based, IT solution. We connect consumers to local IT professionals through the web. The whole thing will be free to consumers and technicians and we will only take a small portion of profit to cover operating costs and monetary guarantees on hardware loss/damage.
Consumers get cheap, fast, local, service that they wont have to pay for if it doesn't fix the problem, and technicians will get a trusting consumer base and a wage significantly higher than at a big-box retailer.
We will background check and verify credentials for all of our technicians guaranteeing that consumers are safe and in good hands. Service will only cost 30$ for a house call plus 30$ for every hour required past the first 30 min.
My name is Chance Wees and I am a Programmer, Game Designer/Developer, and Entrepreneur. I had the idea for this service about 2 weeks ago and I thought it sounded good enough to make a reality. The team from my game studio and I are working on the web service and website which we hope to have ready for deployment within 45 days.

I also want to provide options to individuals and businesses who like to change up what's on their walls to ""rent"" artwork for a change every so often or if an area needs staging.

founders of ThinkActBuyLocal.com, LLC. Gregory Panos, Raymond Steinbacher, and
Jeffrey Morgan, formed ThinkActBuyLocal.com, LLC., in 2013 as a company devoted
to helping local, small businesses grow and compete in this ever-changing
business environment, with our mission being to provide products (applications)
and resources that will allow small businesses to optimize all the latest
technology.  </p>
<p>The idea for an easier way to order food for delivery came
about when the founders ordered pizza for the office. They realized that they
ordered the same items on the same day of the week...every week. After
researching this phenomena, it was discovered that about 86% of all pizza
orders (for delivery) follow this pattern. </p>
<p>National pizza chains have the resources to create online ordering systems that make it easier for patrons to order pizza. During our discussion, we
discovered that we had all ordered from one of these national chains, not
because of the quality of their product, but due to the convenience of ordering
through their system. This is when the lightbulb went on.</p>
<p>We postulated that we could create an app, tied to a
device (refrigerator magnet) that made it so easy to order food (pizza) from
your favorite vendor...at the push of a button. The issues we faced were:</p>
<p></p><ul>
<li><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">How
to involve multiple pizza vendors</b></li>
<li><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">How
to make it work without tethering it to a specific phone or device (in other words, NOT using bluetooth) so that you can use the button even when your phone is not within the area. This way parents can allow the kids or their baby-sitter to order dinner while they are enjoying a night out.</b></li>
<li><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">How
to make the entire process of ordering seamless, so that all financial transactions are automatic.</b></li>
</ul><p></p>
<p>In the matter of a few days we felt that we pretty much
had a solution. The button would act somewhat like an EZ Pass used on highways
for tolls. We would create the backend dashboard where participating vendors
would be able to post their menus. The patrons would activate their button by
making a minimum deposit (i.e., $50.00). They would then be able to choose a
vendor, and set up a 'standing order'. When the button is pushed, the order is
sent to the chosen vendor, and upon delivery, the vendor would be paid (less a small commission)  through
the funds on deposit with the button. The funds would be automatically
replenished at a chosen level. </p><p>We then built a rough (very rough) prototype for proof of concept. When it worked, we felt we had a winning concept, so we applied for a patent (and are currently patent-pending), created a business plan, and decided to crowd-source our funding.</p>
<p>This is the 30,000 foot view of the process. It is
obviously much more involved and detailed. Our goal is to raise enough capital
to manufacture the first 10,000 Pizza Bite Buttons, and make sure that we create an infrastructure that will be capable of handling
the growth rate we anticipate.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p>

<p></p></div>","Push. Order. Enjoy.Pizza...when it's good it's great...and when it's bad, it's still pretty good.The Pizza Bite Button works with wireless technology to send your preset order from your smartphone or computer to your favorite local pizza shop instantly… and that’s it! One touch and your food shows up! 
Your order is paid for automatically from funds in your personal Pizza Bite Button account. Much like an EZ-Pass can check or replenish your account balance anytime you want. You will also receive an alert when you balance is getting low.
The Pizza Bite Button not only makes ordering your favorite meal easy, but it’s great for local small business. This is one of our many small business projects, all geared towards boosting local economies and helping people to support their local communities.An Idea Born Over Lunch
The Bite Button Company is the brainchild of the three
founders of ThinkActBuyLocal.com, LLC. Gregory Panos, Raymond Steinbacher, and
Jeffrey Morgan, formed ThinkActBuyLocal.com, LLC., in 2013 as a company devoted
to helping local, small businesses grow and compete in this ever-changing
business environment, with our mission being to provide products (applications)
and resources that will allow small businesses to optimize all the latest
technology.  
The idea for an easier way to order food for delivery came
about when the founders ordered pizza for the office. They realized that they
ordered the same items on the same day of the week...every week. After
researching this phenomena, it was discovered that about 86% of all pizza
orders (for delivery) follow this pattern. 
National pizza chains have the resources to create online ordering systems that make it easier for patrons to order pizza. During our discussion, we
discovered that we had all ordered from one of these national chains, not
because of the quality of their product, but due to the convenience of ordering
through their system. This is when the lightbulb went on.
We postulated that we could create an app, tied to a
device (refrigerator magnet) that made it so easy to order food (pizza) from
your favorite vendor...at the push of a button. The issues we faced were:

How
to involve multiple pizza vendors
How
to make it work without tethering it to a specific phone or device (in other words, NOT using bluetooth) so that you can use the button even when your phone is not within the area. This way parents can allow the kids or their baby-sitter to order dinner while they are enjoying a night out.
How
to make the entire process of ordering seamless, so that all financial transactions are automatic.

In the matter of a few days we felt that we pretty much
had a solution. The button would act somewhat like an EZ Pass used on highways
for tolls. We would create the backend dashboard where participating vendors
would be able to post their menus. The patrons would activate their button by
making a minimum deposit (i.e., $50.00). They would then be able to choose a
vendor, and set up a 'standing order'. When the button is pushed, the order is
sent to the chosen vendor, and upon delivery, the vendor would be paid (less a small commission)  through
the funds on deposit with the button. The funds would be automatically
replenished at a chosen level. We then built a rough (very rough) prototype for proof of concept. When it worked, we felt we had a winning concept, so we applied for a patent (and are currently patent-pending), created a business plan, and decided to crowd-source our funding.
This is the 30,000 foot view of the process. It is
obviously much more involved and detailed. Our goal is to raise enough capital
to manufacture the first 10,000 Pizza Bite Buttons, and make sure that we create an infrastructure that will be capable of handling
the growth rate we anticipate.
The Importance of 'Local'
With over 90,000 local pizza shops in the United States the Pizza Bite Button will help to bring more business to our local economies and save you time and hassle!
Everyone should understand that supporting local businesses helps to maintain a strong community, both economically and socially. The mission of our organization and The Pizza Bite Button is to promote patronage and support of locally owned small businesses, while educating consumers as to the positive impact socially, economically, and environmentally this engagement creates.
                                Small businesses need to be integrated into the mobile landscape and connected to the world of social media. That's where we come in...Think. Act. Buy... Local will keep you connected to the world at the forefront of social media and engage your local pizza parlors through our Pizza Bite Button, so you can help promote a more connected and prosperous community.Our Plan
We are raising money on INDIEGOGO to fund the initial production run of Pizza Bite Buttons and the integration of our proprietary back end software. With your help we can all have fresh, hot pizza at our doorsteps with no hassles… all at the push of a button! All Pizza Bite Buttons will be manufactured in the U.S. by local businesses further supporting our small business movement to think, act and buy local. Eventually we plan to offer multiple Bite Buttons for Chinese food, Delis, the munchies and more but for now we are focusing on your favorite and ours… pizza!DevelopmentWe have been working for a while now, from our first ""Frankensteined"" prototype to a more refined button, on perfecting the process involved in ordering from the Pizza Bite Button. With your help we can fund the initial run of buttons and complete the backend software needed to bring you fresh hot local pizza... at the push of a button!And yes!... when you request a button so that you can set up a Pizza Bite Button account it comes to you in a tiny pizza box (left)!The Team

<p>I am a Board member/a passionate supporter of IPM
(International Partners in Mission), a development agency founded in 1974 and
headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio. The reason why I am passionate supporter of
IPM is the fact that, over the past 40 years, it has partnered with over 300 community-based organizations around
the world to implement 348 Project Partner children, women and youth
initiatives in over 40 countries. The projects are incredible and often become self-sustaining. Your contribution is not just a payment, leaving the woman or child in need of another payment in the future, but a way to allow such folks in need to leverage your contribution to become self-sustaining. </p>
<p>Why international, when there are plenty in need here in the U.S.? For me, the answer is three-fold: (1) IPM focuses on those children and women on the fringes of society that don't have basic needs such as food and water (fortunately, such needs in the US are mostly provided already); (2) a dollar spent internationally is much, much more impactful than the same dollar spent in the U.S.; (3) IPM is a small organization that has very little overhead so more of a contribution goes directly to the children and women in need.</p>
<p>IPM’s mission is to work across boundaries of
culture, faith, and economic circumstance with children, women, and youth, to
create partnerships that build justice, peace, and hope. In 2013 alone, IPM shall
impact some 60,000 of the most marginalized individuals around the world, through
providing technical assistance &amp; training programs and financial assistance
to more than 60 Project Partners in some 20 countries.</p>
<p>As one of the few development agencies headquartered in
Cleveland, IPM has helped connect the city to the world in multiple ways. IPM
annually hosts more than ten international visitors to Northeast Ohio to share
their expertise and experiences on various topics of global importance with
local institutional Partners as well as by stemming the brain drain, by
bringing over 30 people so far from countries such as India, Ireland, Italy,
Kenya, and Romania to Cleveland to work in the local office. Finally, through
its Immersion Experience Programs, short-term trips to the countries and
communities, where IPM works, initiated in 2003, IPM has enabled over 1,600
individuals to walk in solidarity with the locals and to become advocates for
international social justice. In 2014 alone, IPM shall organize more than 20
Immersion Experience to 6 countries, including the Dominican Republic, El
Salvador, India, Italy, Kenya, Nepal, Tanzania, and the USA.</p>
<p>In celebration of its 40<sup>th</sup> anniversary, IPM is committed to
enhancing its ability to provide support for its project partners and to continuing
to connect Cleveland to the World. </p>
<p>In order to
enhance its decision-making abilities, IPM will be hosting its inaugural
General Assembly—a weeklong series of events in Cleveland, October 13th-17<sup>th</sup>,
2014. </p>
<p>The G.A. shall include a
core group of 40 stakeholders from IPM’s international constituencies—including
persons from Brazil, Canada, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador,
India, Italy, Kenya, Nepal, and across the USA. The participants will come
together to deepen and broaden the indigenization of all aspects of IPM’s
governance, operations, and programs. </p>
<p>The G.A. will be a weeklong series of luncheon and
dinner events, most of which will be open to the public. They will bring together renowned local and national speakers
and will cover local and global topics, ranging from the activity of global
nonprofits in Cleveland to women’s rights in Kenya. A highly
anticipated guest is Rick Steves, television personality and author of <i>Travel as a Political Act</i> as well as <i>Travels in Europe with Rick Steves</i>.
Steves is a passionate advocate for independent travel, encouraging his
audience to become ‘temporary locals’ and visit not just major cities, but also
villages and towns that are off the beaten path.</p>
<p>The
General Assembly will also include IPM’s annual event, Namaste! Multi-Cultural
Celebration, which raises funds for the over 60 Project Partners that IPM is
currently supporting in the Unites States as well as across the globe. The
eventfeatureslive entertainment with global music and cultural dance
performances, a variety of eclectic foods accompanied with a diversity of wines
and other beverages, a fabulous silent auction, and a wide selection of
fair-trade handcrafts from around the world.</p>
<p><b>I
believe that the G.A. will allow IPM to deepen its lived commitment to its
mission, vision and core values, better serve its Project Partners throughout
the developing world and further connect Cleveland to the world.  </b></p>
<p>By
funding this campaign, you will support a nonprofit that has had an incredible track

community-projects across the world and to make Cleveland a more global city. </p>

of three. As long as I can remember, I’ve always enjoyed “playing” in hair.
Teaching myself basic braiding and cornrow techniques, I eventually made a
hobby of styling the hair of family and friends. It began as a hobby, but
through much struggle and passion, it is has now become my career. With this
reality comes a breakthrough for not only me but for those I love. My family history
reveals only a few successes along the way so with this achievement, my
children and other family members can find hope, aspiration, and purpose. </p>
<p>This campaign will fuel the construction of the It’s Only
Natural Salon. The realization of this salon will fulfill my ambition to serve
others through hair styling and hair care. My goal is to provide a unique
service to women and girls by offering personal hair styling as well as hair
care education. For years I have heard the cries of ladies who want to look
their best so they can feel good about themselves. When they come to It’s Only
Natural Salon, they will leave with a beautiful look, a lift to their
self-esteem, and with information on how to care for and maintain their hair. </p>
<p>While the space for the salon sits vacant and ready to be
used, I need help with the contents and cosmetics. This includes curtains for
the windows, paint for the walls, and the installation of a shampoo bowl. To
create a nurturing atmosphere for an endearing hair-styling experience, $3500
must be raised. Your contribution is not all about helping me to launch a
business, though that’s a small fraction of it. It is mostly about changing
lives; beginning with my own, then extending to every customer I will serve. If
you don’t think hair styles and hair care can make a difference in someone’s
life, just compliment someone today on the way that person’s hair looks or just
take a look in the mirror. Good or bad, the way your hair looks will have an
impact on how you feel about yourself.</p>
<p>This campaign begins my journey; I am on my way.  With your help I’ll be able to see a dream
become a reality, and I’ll be able to give my clients a much deserving hair
care experience. You can be assured that all funds raised will go towards the

The resale shop is owned and operated by Arlene Parris. With over 25 years in the Sales &amp; Customer Service Industry, her career has granted her insight into business operations &amp; experience in running her own company. Her confidence and passion for helping others will lead her to have a strong successful business. Arlene, very familiar with the needs of her community, has leverage and keen insight into her specific industry: with a wide selection of<br/>new and used name brand/designer consignment goods at discount cost, her niche<br/>store has no direct competition in the immediate area. </p><p>Within nine months, 'Alrene's Apparels &amp; More' has established a steady stream consignment drop-off, on both a daily and weekly basis. Ours is the only consignment store in the area that offers our customers the opportunity to earn extra funds. We are able to capitalize on this incredible opportunity because we don’t have to purchase merchandise to resell and the majority of our consignment customers bring in high quality items. Due to our success, we now need a larger store to expand our business and offer more employment for the community. We have secured a<br/>new location which offers very good foot traffic and easy accessibility. We have efficiently designed the store's layout to increase sales and give the customers the utmost attention. This attention to detail combined with our passion to help others and knowledge of the resale industry will help the store reach a profitable level quickly. We will also offer employment to those in our community. In addition, this new location is large enough to host monthly crowd-funding events for other struggling small business owners in need of funding.</p><p>Your funds will be used mainly to renovate and fix up the historic building, offer employment to help the economy, and continue consignment to help everyone and anyone in need of extra funds. This larger space will also allow us the opportunity to host a monthly ""Crowd-funding Event."" Such an event will allow us to give back by reaching out to other successful business owners in the area, requesting that they match any funds raised in our event and donate both meals and their time in order to help us organize this event. </p><p>Funding 'Arlene's Apparels &amp;  More' Will Help Us to Help Others In Four<br/>Ways:</p><p><span>1.<span>  </span></span>Beautify our newly designated historical district by renting and renovating the new space. Before now, it has only served as an abandoned eyesore in the neighborhood.</p><p><span><span>2.<span>  </span></span>We will try to do our part by helping the economy and offering paid employment. In addition, we will provide a college internship program, open our doors to any retired seniors, and take care of vets seeking volunteer positions.</span></p><span><p><span>3.<span>  </span></span>We will offer extra funds to those in need with consignment. </p>
<p><span>4.<span>  </span></span> Finally, we will offer a monthly crowd-funding event to serve other small business owners. </p></span><p> </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><span><p>To fulfill its goals and objectives, 'Arlene's Apparels &amp; More' requires funding in the amount of $60,000.00 to ensure its successful future. Funding will be allocated toward the listed expansion elements.</p></span><p><b>Expansion Summary</b></p><ul>
<li>Employment &amp; Wages/2+ Part-Time Employees Minimum Wage Payout For A Year-$15,080.00</li>

</ul><p>Based on our projections, we believe that awarding funding to 'Arlene's Apparels &amp; More' will be a sound investment. With the increasing demands on employment, we believe we will successfully capture our target market, meet our financial objectives, and fulfill our mission. </p><p><strong>Shopping Perks</strong></p><p>To allow our community's low-income family fair access to our store, we will offer coupons, gift cards, loyalty cards, and implement a store credit program for frequent shoppers.

</ul><p><b>Not Enough Funding</b></p><p>If we are unable to reach our funding goal, any funds obtained will be distributed across the company. The majority of our funding request will serve our community by allowing us to offer employment while reserving a year's salary for 2+ part-time employees in advance. If full funding is not obtained, we will seek other funding events or use a portion of merchandise sales. This process will take some time, but I have faith it will be done.</p><p> </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Impact</h3><p>'Arlene's Apparels &amp; More' aims to provide our community a better way of life; to our future employees we will give honest employment; and our customers will receive good quality merchandise at reasonable prices. We exist to attract and maintain two types of customers: the buyers and the consignors.  We hold leverage over our competition because we provide a superior quality product line, low cost competitive prices, negotiable prices, and a friendly atmosphere. We are the only consignment shop in our area and we attract clients due to our willingness to serve our community in any way possible. </p><p>Our goal is to excel in the consignment and resale business by increasing our product lines annually. By opening a larger location with more varieties of services, we will be able to play a small part in repairing our economy by offering employment opportunities. </p><p> </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>If you're not able to support us by funding our campaign, then please spread the word about our business! Tell your friends, family, co-workers, and church members about us. Lead them to our page on  <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com,/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.Indiegogo.com</a> so that they can see what we are looking for and why. We just ask that you help us help our community. Help us tell the Greater Houston area and the whole world where we are located and what we have to offer.  If people know where we are located and our goals, they can support, shop, and take advantage of our daily sales. These actions will help us raise funds to secure the larger location. </p><p>Understanding America's current economy, we intend to support our neighbors by keeping our prices low - our community members won’t have to pay extra for the merchandise they want and need. Our expansion will allow us to offer more merchandise through our continuous emphasis on customer satisfaction, introduction to product enhancement, while establishing long-term relations with our consignment customers. </p><p><br/><br/> </p></div>","Short Summary'Arlene's Apparels & More' is a new resale-consignment shop established early this year and it is located in SE Houston, Texas.

Her confidence and passion for helping others will lead her to have a strong successful business. Arlene, very familiar with the needs of her community, has leverage and keen insight into her specific industry: with a wide selection ofnew and used name brand/designer consignment goods at discount cost, her nichestore has no direct competition in the immediate area. Within nine months, 'Alrene's Apparels & More' has established a steady stream consignment drop-off, on both a daily and weekly basis. Ours is the only consignment store in the area that offers our customers the opportunity to earn extra funds. We are able to capitalize on this incredible opportunity because we don’t have to purchase merchandise to resell and the majority of our consignment customers bring in high quality items. Due to our success, we now need a larger store to expand our business and offer more employment for the community. We have secured anew location which offers very good foot traffic and easy accessibility. We have efficiently designed the store's layout to increase sales and give the customers the utmost attention. This attention to detail combined with our passion to help others and knowledge of the resale industry will help the store reach a profitable level quickly. We will also offer employment to those in our community. In addition, this new location is large enough to host monthly crowd-funding events for other struggling small business owners in need of funding.Your funds will be used mainly to renovate and fix up the historic building, offer employment to help the economy, and continue consignment to help everyone and anyone in need of extra funds. This larger space will also allow us the opportunity to host a monthly ""Crowd-funding Event."" Such an event will allow us to give back by reaching out to other successful business owners in the area, requesting that they match any funds raised in our event and donate both meals and their time in order to help us organize this event. Funding 'Arlene's Apparels &  More' Will Help Us to Help Others In FourWays:1.  Beautify our newly designated historical district by renting and renovating the new space. Before now, it has only served as an abandoned eyesore in the neighborhood.2.  We will try to do our part by helping the economy and offering paid employment. In addition, we will provide a college internship program, open our doors to any retired seniors, and take care of vets seeking volunteer positions.3.  We will offer extra funds to those in need with consignment. 
4.   Finally, we will offer a monthly crowd-funding event to serve other small business owners.  What We Need & What You GetTo fulfill its goals and objectives, 'Arlene's Apparels & More' requires funding in the amount of $60,000.00 to ensure its successful future.

Shopping PerksTo allow our community's low-income family fair access to our store, we will offer coupons, gift cards, loyalty cards, and implement a store credit program for frequent shoppers.

Not Enough FundingIf we are unable to reach our funding goal, any funds obtained will be distributed across the company. The majority of our funding request will serve our community by allowing us to offer employment while reserving a year's salary for 2+ part-time employees in advance. If full funding is not obtained, we will seek other funding events or use a portion of merchandise sales. This process will take some time, but I have faith it will be done. The Impact'Arlene's Apparels & More' aims to provide our community a better way of life; to our future employees we will give honest employment; and our customers will receive good quality merchandise at reasonable prices. We exist to attract and maintain two types of customers: the buyers and the consignors.  We hold leverage over our competition because we provide a superior quality product line, low cost competitive prices, negotiable prices, and a friendly atmosphere. We are the only consignment shop in our area and we attract clients due to our willingness to serve our community in any way possible. Our goal is to excel in the consignment and resale business by increasing our product lines annually. By opening a larger location with more varieties of services, we will be able to play a small part in repairing our economy by offering employment opportunities.  Other Ways You Can HelpIf you're not able to support us by funding our campaign, then please spread the word about our business!

Understanding America's current economy, we intend to support our neighbors by keeping our prices low - our community members won’t have to pay extra for the merchandise they want and need. Our expansion will allow us to offer more merchandise through our continuous emphasis on customer satisfaction, introduction to product enhancement, while establishing long-term relations with our consignment customers.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Zion Care Orphanage and Widow Center in Shangirai, Tanzania is the vision of Rebecca and Japheth Mollel. With the help of a dedicated team of international sponsors, the Center became a reality in 2010. Today, there are 17 orphans ages 3-14 living at the Center.</p>
<p>As it stands today, the Center is at times dependent on donations in order to provide food for the orphans and widows. But the opportunity has now presented itself for them to buy a plot of farm land nearby. With this land, they would become self-sufficient in terms of food. The sole purpose of this campaign is to raise the funds necessary to buy the farm land.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Our goal is to raise SEK 28,000 (EUR 3,000), which will be used to buy the Center the farm land they need to become self-sufficient and able to feed the orphans who live at and widows who visit the Center. Your gift of any size is greatly appreciated.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Being able to farm this land would mean food self-sufficiency for the Center. And that would make funds otherwise invested in food available for other important projects, such as the maintenance and development of the Center.</p>
