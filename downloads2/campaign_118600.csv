<h3>Story of My Book</h3>Surrounded by Awesome Women, Unlocking the New Model of Women's Success in Business and Entrepreneurship for the Next Decade is a startup business incubator model developed after five years of research working with women who run their own businesses. It includes a roadmap of how to succeed as a business owner, with key milestones documented and an understanding of the typical emotions faced at each phase of business ownership.  <br/><br/>My name is Sheila Long and I wrote this book because I want to see more women in business starting, leading, and growing companies. My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover what is normal for entrepreneurs at each phase of running a business, including attaining encouragement and support. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for women leading businesses from idea contemplation to the business expansion. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you understand that success is defined differently for women at each phase of their business.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about why women choose to exit the corporate ladder and do not hire more than five employees when they grow their businesses or sales. You'll read stories like...<ul>
<li>A woman who built a company with 170 pro bono coaches in thirty countries, focused on young women and social change makers.</li>
<li>Another woman that distributed and manufactured a medical device product which allows patients to get an ECG heart reading in seconds from their home.  </li>
<li>A TV critic whose life was altered while interviewing a celebrity.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you are a woman in the forty to fifty age range, or if you are contemplating starting a business. You will also enjoy this book if you are a man who understands that women’s viewpoints are unique and is interested in addressing gender inequality.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>The Book</h3>
<br/>The book is written in three parts.<br/><br/>Part 1 contains the Introduction and Chapters 1-5. The traditional view of white men and women with rose-colored glasses is introduced—where the glass ceiling is attainable, and everyone is capable of building an amazing business that makes millions of dollars. It worked for Anne Machesky, who became a financial planner in the 1980s and Amanda Baltz, who built a medical device business by taking advantage of opportunities put in front of her. This section delves into how this view does not work for most women, black, and brown people.  <br/><br/>Part 2 contains Chapters 6-9. The current view of today, where we are at a breaking point, comes to light here complete with a story of how I got sick and had to leave my blossoming corporate career. This section explains the value of accepting sorrow and betrayal, while adequately consoling ourselves from broken dreams. Only after this, can we accept our true reality of support and forge a realistic professional path forward.<br/><br/>Part 3 contains Chapters 10-12. The solution is rolled out here with the Startup Sales Incubator. It explains the role of Sexism and Networking and how it shapes women’s professional growth. When women have the right support and self-assessment mechanisms in place, we can grow and expand our businesses. We are inspired with the story of Cindy Machles, who is growing an Advertising business in New York City and Hannah Anderson, who has expanded her dog treat business nationally.<br/> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3>
<p>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:</p>

<li>The copy editing for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.</li>
<li>The launch &amp; promotion efforts for my book when I ultimately publish this Spring, 2021.</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>When I pre-sell 120 copies of my book, I will publish a paperback and ebook. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish a hardcover edition.

<h2>The Story of <i>Everything I Leave Behind For You</i>
</h2>
<p>When I was 16, I was held in a mental hospital because of my third attempted suicide. And at 21, I’m graduated from the University of Chicago.<br/><br/>My name is Emily Her and I am the author of <i>Everything I Leave Behind For You</i>.</p>
<p>Mental disorders were ""something that other people got"", never me. Sitting in my seventh-grade, one-week mental health unit in my middle school science class, I learned what ""depression"" and ""self-harm"" were. I watched the 2-hour long movie explain that people with mental disorders are unable to function and lack long-term goals.</p>
<p>But, I'm normal. Depression, anxiety, and mental disorders are all ""something that other people got"". Not me. </p>
<p>Hi, I'm Emily! I graduated early from a top university, began my own six-figure creative agency, co-founded a start-up, and work at a competitive consulting firm. How are you?</p>
<p>Hi, I'm Emily! I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety at 11, involuntarily held in a mental hospital at 16 for a third attempted suicide, and asked to drop out of university at 18 due to my eating disorder condition. How are you?</p>
<p>I embody the spitting image of conventional success. I am also the spitting image of those patients I saw in my seventh-grade class.</p>
<p>I was told in my freshman year that if I continued to stay in college, I may not be able to survive because of how much danger my body was in. I’ve struggled with depression, anxiety, and eating disorders since I was 11. It threatened me to drop out of school at various points for inpatient care, and it made me risk my life at my own hands. Unfortunately, I am only one of millions who struggle daily to simply live with myself.</p>
<p>But I also am one of millions who refuse to just be a statistic. </p>
<p>It took 18 years of my life before I began to understand that I, too, suffer from ""something that other people got""; there was no ""other people"", just humans with a human experience of mental health.</p>
<p>I’m often asked what drives me to keep living during the darkest hours. I used to be lost for an answer and temporarily found security in answering that it was all for a stable future. It was not completely a lie — hope was my greatest weapon that I did not know I had at times. But now, I’ve learned that my will to live and fight is driven by the wish to help as many people as I can reach to never experience the depths that I did.</p>
<p>My therapist tells me that he has never seen so much poison in a girl of my age. My hope, after living in this body of poison for 21 years, is to lessen the world of as much poison as I can. </p>
<p>For the past year, I have been working on writing my book, “Everything I Leave Behind For You”. I had always been asked by others and myself how I can share my story and lessons with as many as possible, and it was during this past year when I found myself struggling again that the time to help others is always now.</p>
<p>My hope is that my writing will be able to give readers a greater will to live and fight on. No matter what we have crumpled under, are stumbling over, or will be beaten by, we can’t wait for the world and its challenges to pass by before we take charge of our own lives and happiness. Through my book, I recollect memories from conversations, the mental hospital, and therapy in a raw and vulnerable expression of my struggles so that others will not need to experience them. To learn how to find themselves again-- we're all a little bit lost, after all. </p>
<p>When I first announced my book ""Everything I Leave Behind For You"" in a previous Linkedin post, I received an overwhelming amount of support. Every stranger who found enough value in my message to reach out to me has completely moved me. You all show me that we are all of a single human experience with shared struggles, heartache, and need for mental well-being. You all motivated me to keep sharing my vulnerabilities. That this will all be worth it. </p>
<p>A bit less than a week ago I began the preorders of my book. I detail my struggles and learnings in mental health so that hopefully, others will not need to experience what I did. My wish is that future generations will never see mental health as something of ""other people"" only, but of something that we are all human to. </p>
<p>It would mean a lot to me if you could help me support my journey by pre-ordering a copy or helping spread the word about mental wellbeing in high-functioning spaces. If you or someone you know are a part of organizations, media groups, or podcasts promoting mental health or life wellness, I would be more than honored to share my experiences with your platform. </p>
<p>To the small number of you who have backed my book and shared my work, I cannot express how much it moves me when I receive your preorders and warm responses. Thank you for showing an 11-year-old, 16-year-old, and 21-year-old me that there is hope. </p>You will love this book if you’re searching for the beginning to conversations about mental health with your friends, family, peers, coworkers, acquaintances, strangers, or yourself. Start the conversations today.<br/><br/><i>Everything I Leave Behind For You</i> speaks to each of us: from the burnt out working professional to the over-pressured student to the concerned mother or father. How do we begin to understand our human experiences if we never learned to be vulnerable about our own human experiences?<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that <i>Everything I Leave Behind For You</i> inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue around topics such as<ul>
<li>Individual reflection</li>
<li>Interpersonal community dynamics</li>
<li>Societal stigma surrounding the topic of mental health</li>
<li>I really look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers!</li>
</ul> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:<ul>

<h3>About the Author</h3>
<p><br/>Emily Her is a recent graduate and a management consultant. She was born and raised in the Bay Area of California, where mental health was a conversation that was not encouraged in the notoriously competitive community.

Her hope is that with enough conversations and the continued efforts of generations fighting for mental wellness, her challenges that are shared with too many will never need to be repeated in history.<br/><br/>When not overthinking, Emily can be found creating art, eating peanut butter crackers, or listening to chef documentaries.<br/><br/>For more information, you can connect with Emily Her at author.emilyher@gmail.com and <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/emuiu/?hl=en"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Instagram</a> or <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/emily-her/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Linkedin</a>.</p>

How do we begin to understand our human experiences if we never learned to be vulnerable about our own human experiences?Ultimately, I hope that Everything I Leave Behind For You inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue around topics such as
Individual reflection
Interpersonal community dynamics
Societal stigma surrounding the topic of mental health
I really look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers!
 What We Need & What You'll GetThis book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:
The Editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in December 2021
The Cover Design of my book. (The mockups you see currently are a placeholder!)
The Layout Design for the interior of my book (physical copy, ebook formats).
The Copyediting for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.
The Launch & Promotion Efforts for my book when I ultimately publish this winter.
I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:
You will receive a personally signed copy of my book when I publish and a handwritten thank-you note.
You will receive early access to the Introduction and some excerpts from my book, with the opportunity to review it and give me early feedback.

And much more!

About the Author
Emily Her is a recent graduate and a management consultant. She was born and raised in the Bay Area of California, where mental health was a conversation that was not encouraged in the notoriously competitive community. After struggling and fighting for 21 years, she is sharing her story and lessons with the world to experience. Her hope is that with enough conversations and the continued efforts of generations fighting for mental wellness, her challenges that are shared with too many will never need to be repeated in history.When not overthinking, Emily can be found creating art, eating peanut butter crackers, or listening to chef documentaries.For more information, you can connect with Emily Her at author.emilyher@gmail.com and Instagram or Linkedin.
 
International PreordersFor international preorders, please do the following:Identify the perk that interests you, e.g. 1 or 2 paperbacks
Select the pink ""Back it"" button to ""Make a contribution"" for the same amount (this choice bypasses the shipping address page)
Use this form (https://forms.gle/tpeHwb4W5zn7hMiG7) to share your mailing address, so I can calculate the international shipping costs and invoice you for that amount via PayPal/Venmo
Risks & Challenges The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies are expected to ship. Other Ways You Can HelpNot everyone can support, but that doesn't mean you can't get something out of it!I will reward the top 3 people who refer the most backers at the end of the campaign (30 days). Here's how:
At the top of the campaign page, you will see the ""share"" buttons. Click on the ""chain"" icon to get a custom link just for you. (Note: don't use the URL in the browser window as it won't work to track referrals and you won't get credit.)
Copy that link and paste it on your social media, email it to a friend, or text a fellow book lover.
When someone clicks on that link and backs the book, you get 1 entry!

<h3>My First Cookbook: Kitchen Ritual</h3>
<p>As a lifelong lover of cooking, and a professional chef for the last decade, <strong>I want to help you transform cooking from something you dread, to an experience you love. </strong>And, if you already love to cook, I want to help you enjoy it even more. I believe all of this is accessible to anyone who is willing to approach cooking through the lens of <strong>mindfulness</strong>. For me, a mindful approach to cooking means enjoying the process from start to finish, not just obsessing over a ""perfect"" end product. </p>
<p>Whether you're a seasoned home chef, or someone who gets anxious just thinking about cooking, the 128 plant-based, whole-foods recipes in this book are designed to inspire you to spend more time nourishing yourself. And, while you're at it, you just may begin to eat healthier and perhaps discover some new ingredients you love too!</p>
<p>I've poured my heart and soul into this book over many years and worked with a brilliant team to create a book that is as beautiful as the recipes are delicious. <strong>Pre-order your copy now!<br/><br/>Update October 15, 2017: THANK YOU to everyone who helped this campaign reach full funding in just 6 days!!! I'm pleased to announce a STRETCH GOAL challenge: for every $1,000 raised beyond the target goal amount of $8,000, I'll release an additional recipe to all backer in a PDF e-Book format.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Update October 16: The first additional recipe has been unlocked, and we are halfway to unlocking a second bonus recipe for all backers!</strong><br/> </p>

<h3>What's the Ritual?</h3>
<p>When I consider this definition of ritual: “<i><strong>a series of activities performed in a particular place, and performed according to set sequence</strong></i>,” I think it perfectly describes what happens in kitchens worldwide—in homes, five-star restaurants, even roadside snack shacks. The simple act of cooking is itself a ritual, one that I find incredibly sacred. It is the ritual of sustenance, the fount from which our life force energy flows.</p>
<p>As someone who has traveled extensively, I notice that no matter how different the kitchens I’ve visited across the globe may look, there is a core, overarching ritual that transpires within them. Ingredients are procured, various preparations take place, foods are cooked or arranged, then served and enjoyed.</p>
<p>When we cook using whole food ingredients, we are inextricably connected to the rhythmic rituals of the earth itself. We savor ingredients when they are in season and notice when they disappear from the stalls of our farmers market, only to be replaced by something else.</p>
<p>We live in a time where despite all of our many newfangled ways of staying connected, I find that people often feel disconnected—from other people, from nature and from who they truly are. Cooking is one of the simplest and most potent ways I’ve found to remedy this pervasive sense of disconnection, so this book is my contribution to inspiring a more connected planet. I hope you’ll use these recipes to nourish both yourself and others.</p>

</div></div>","My First Cookbook: Kitchen Ritual
As a lifelong lover of cooking, and a professional chef for the last decade, I want to help you transform cooking from something you dread, to an experience you love. And, if you already love to cook, I want to help you enjoy it even more. I believe all of this is accessible to anyone who is willing to approach cooking through the lens of mindfulness.

<h3>My Summer (A synopsis of what's to come)</h3>
<p>Poetry is not a luxury. Audre Lorde’s words reverberate through my very core whenever I lift a finger to create art in any medium, whether it be poetry, prose, film, or music. My art is not a luxury; it is a weapon.</p>
<p>Last year, I founded BITCH Collective, an artist and activist collective for “bitchy” women. That is to say, women who use their art to speak their minds, fight patriarchal oppression, and disrupt social norms and gender roles. As all the members of this collective grow in our respective mediums and passions, so does the collective itself. Our main goal in forming a collective like this is not only for the community and support, but also to invigorate our art to the point of weaponizing it. Art, I believe, is the most powerful political tool one can have. Centre Pompadour will be an excellent place for finding more people to participate in or light a fire in our movement.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495412924/i3bbba6gjnjpqf2kpihg.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>My novel, <i>Beachy Head, </i>deals with cultural memory, inherited trauma, re-memory, isolation, and family through the story of a woman slowly regaining repressed memories of her younger sister’s death by encountering her spirit. The woman spends most of her time in isolation, living in a small home atop Beachy Head in Sussex, where she stays awake in order to catch any jumpers that try to make it up to the cliff. My artistic goals generally settle within the space between art and activism. Whether I’m working with film, poetry, music, or prose I believe that my work should be somewhat weaponized. With <i>Beachy Head</i>, my focus surrounds topics pertaining to the African diaspora and the trauma that is felt throughout it. I was inspired by Koleka Putuma’s spoken word poem “Water” which is about the stereotype of Black people throughout the diaspora being afraid of water or unable to swim. Sharon Bridgforth’s play <i>Delta Dandi</i> also references this idea, tracing generationally held fears through what she calls the “heart mind.” What if, I thought, this is because of inherited fear stemming from the Middle Passage--a sort of collective memory? Thus, my goal with <i>Beachy Head</i> is to trace, examine, and represent the trauma of Black womanhood through one Black woman’s trauma, memories, and repression.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>As a college student, especially at a large university like Cornell, I never had much access to quiet, peace, or isolation. I live in a rowdy co-op with twenty other twenty-somethings, and my social life is extremely active. I love this, however it's not very conducive to <i>Beachy Head</i>, which is the first piece I've worked on that's so meditative and reflective. I believe that the environment at Centre Pompadour will be ideal for working on a novel like this. Not only is it led by Michaela's unabashedly bitchy feminist artistic work, it is also located in the middle of nowhere, so as to give artists space to reflect, think, and create. There, I will finish my novel in an environment that allows me to reflect on my own cultural memory while I write while participating in a vibrant community of likeminded artists and feminist thinkers. I'll be a recent graduate and more ready than ever to start working seriously towards being a professional artist and sharpening the knife that is my art.</p>

<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Centre Pompadour is a ""post-capitalistic undertaking,"" in that the fees for artists are flexible. However, I will still need $800 for my plane journey there, an additional few hundred for food (the ""starving artist"" trope is not as glamorous in real life), $160 for a French Rosetta Stone, and at least $1,000 for self publishing in the fall. During my residency, I'm also planning on squeezing in a trip to East Sussex, the setting of my novel, to stand on the real Beachy Head and complete a photography series of the cliff. To make all of this<i> </i>happen, I need your help. </p>
<p>For any contribution, you'll receive the priceless gift of knowing you've helped a young artist get her start. But there are material gifts too, if that's what you're into. For $10+ your name will be listed in the dedication of this novel. For $25+ you'll receive glossy 4x6 photos from Beachy Head. For $30 you'll receive an e-book of <i>Beachy Head</i>. For $40+ you'll receive a signed copy of the book when it's published or self-published. For $75+ you'll receive all of the above plus a handwritten, original poem. For $100+ you'll receive all of the above plus 2 hours of free editing services (screenplays, resumes, novels, essays, I do it all). Any contribution of any amount also comes with my undying and unconditional love, appreciation, and gratitude. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3></div><div><p>Love has no monetary value. Whether I barely raise a dime or I raise triple my goal amount, please know that I am so grateful to anyone who has taken the time to read about this undertaking of mine. If you are financially unable to give, you can still help support me by sharing this campaign and spreading the word. </p></div></div>","My Summer (A synopsis of what's to come)

However, I will still need $800 for my plane journey there, an additional few hundred for food (the ""starving artist"" trope is not as glamorous in real life), $160 for a French Rosetta Stone, and at least $1,000 for self publishing in the fall. During my residency, I'm also planning on squeezing in a trip to East Sussex, the setting of my novel, to stand on the real Beachy Head and complete a photography series of the cliff. To make all of this happen, I need your help. 
For any contribution, you'll receive the priceless gift of knowing you've helped a young artist get her start. But there are material gifts too, if that's what you're into. For $10+ your name will be listed in the dedication of this novel. For $25+ you'll receive glossy 4x6 photos from Beachy Head. For $30 you'll receive an e-book of Beachy Head. For $40+ you'll receive a signed copy of the book when it's published or self-published. For $75+ you'll receive all of the above plus a handwritten, original poem. For $100+ you'll receive all of the above plus 2 hours of free editing services (screenplays, resumes, novels, essays, I do it all). Any contribution of any amount also comes with my undying and unconditional love, appreciation, and gratitude. 
 
Other Ways You Can HelpLove has no monetary value. Whether I barely raise a dime or I raise triple my goal amount, please know that I am so grateful to anyone who has taken the time to read about this undertaking of mine.

They sway between myth and reality and they battle with legendary creatures from Greek myths and history such as <i><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keres"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Keres</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triton_(mythology)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tritons</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Themistocles"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Themistocles</a></i> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talos"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Talos</i></a>. That’s what you get in Poseidon’s Charm!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The book </strong></h3>
<p>Christophoros is a “next-door” Greek-American teenager spending his summer holidays in Greece. A weird, silent boatman transfers him through one of the Myriad Rivers (ruled by Hades, the god of Death) somewhere in the Aegean Sea, straight to a summer camp of Ionian teenagers who are aliens from Planet Ion. Christophoros will find out about his mysterious birth on Mount Olympus-the Mount of gods, and that he is half-Ionian. He is immersed in the campers’ way of life; he makes new friends and enemies.</p>
<p>However, the camp is in danger. The half-human, half-alien boy is the only one who can travel between the two worlds and at different times. He is the only one who can find Poseidon’s Charm which is the only way for the Ionians to open the galactic gate to their way home and escape a painful death.</p>
<p>This is the beginning of the most dangerous quest of Christophoros’ life! Not having any clue where to search for the Charm, Christophoros and his friends will travel in Delphi, Crete and Mycenae, in the present and in the past, where the heroes will many times put their lives in danger. They will meet <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythia"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pythia</a> and the<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centaur"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> Centaurs,</a> dance in a Cretan wedding, enjoy the sunset at Santorini, battle with Talos, Tritons and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lethe"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lethe</a>. Christophoros will be chased by the Apostate and the Cylonists. He will break the Chains of Time. Although he has powerful enemies, he has true friends and the support of the eternal Gaia and exotic Aphrodite to help him during his difficult quest!</p>
<p><i>Will Christophoros and his friends overcome the difficulties, beat the clock and bring  Poseidon’s Charm to the Ionian camp? Will they manage to save the Ionians from death?</i></p>

<p><strong><i>Been said for the novel: </i></strong></p>
<p> “The truth is that it is quite difficult to categorize the novel within young adults' literature. Is it a book of adventure? This is obvious! Is it a fantasy book? According to Darko Suvin, it surely is, since it offers an alternative to the global setting in which we live.  Is it science fiction? Of course, it is! Aliens, spaceships, physical laws and scientific principles extended. However, there are significant elements of historical fiction, too. Besides its precise references to historic events, according to many researchers, mythologies such as the Greek one, are actually the non-written history. Myths are nothing but the reflection, crystallization and condensation of historical narratives, accumulated in the collective memory of ancient societies and transmitted orally from one generation to another. Therefore, it is quite obvious that the Poseidon’s Charm is a brilliant, multifaceted novel,  a wonderful debut with just the right kind of plot twists that keep you turning pages!”   </p>

<h2><strong>The why</strong></h2>
<p>I love fantasy novels. As a Greek woman, I have been living my whole life at the foothills of Mount Olympus, the home of the Greek gods, next to Mount Pelion with the Centaurs and close to Litochoro village with the strange, still-unexplained phenomena and the exceptional Aegean Sea. Inevitably, I grew up with the Greek myths and legends <i>(and, oh my God!!! Greek mythology is vast and fascinating!).</i> On the other hand, the marvels of Ancient Greek Technology and all those ancient Greek inventors like Archimedes and Heron inspired me to become a mechanical engineer.</p>
</div><div>
<p>I dreamed of a novel with a harmonious blend of adventure and Greek elements of mythology, tradition and history along with science fiction, aliens and alien technology. It is engaging and fascinating, with the Greek identity beyond doubt. </p>
<p>The inspiration of this book came to me in 2005 when a Greek summer wind stumbled on the clear sea waters of <a href=""https://www.larissa-beach.gr/en/larissa-beach/larissa-beaches/velika"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Velika</a>, Thessaly. The very first lines of the book describe the stormy sea of that day!</p>
<p align=""center""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1573472415/qmckcnmpk5z8kzeam93u.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>At once intensely Greek and cosmopolitan, full of adventures, filled with images of the Greek breeze, light and purity, the 340-page novel intends to immerse everyone- children, young adult and older readers- in intense action and illuminate the Greek spirit. Unimagined technology blends harmonically with the authentic Greek myth experience in its own home-place together with contemporary Greek culture and lifestyle. Traditions and local mores, religion, music, food and flavors, the stories and secrets of the Greek land and sea compose the background for this fantasy adventurous novel with its young heroes to live on the edge of myth and reality.</p>
<p>And yes! In Greece, one can never tell where fiction ends and where history begins…</p>
<p>I really hope the story and characters will capture the readers’ hearts!</p>

Christophoros is a “next-door” Greek-American teenager spending his summer holidays in Greece. A weird, silent boatman transfers him through one of the Myriad Rivers (ruled by Hades, the god of Death) somewhere in the Aegean Sea, straight to a summer camp of Ionian teenagers who are aliens from Planet Ion. Christophoros will find out about his mysterious birth on Mount Olympus-the Mount of gods, and that he is half-Ionian. He is immersed in the campers’ way of life; he makes new friends and enemies.
However, the camp is in danger. The half-human, half-alien boy is the only one who can travel between the two worlds and at different times. He is the only one who can find Poseidon’s Charm which is the only way for the Ionians to open the galactic gate to their way home and escape a painful death.
This is the beginning of the most dangerous quest of Christophoros’ life! Not having any clue where to search for the Charm, Christophoros and his friends will travel in Delphi, Crete and Mycenae, in the present and in the past, where the heroes will many times put their lives in danger. They will meet Pythia and the Centaurs, dance in a Cretan wedding, enjoy the sunset at Santorini, battle with Talos, Tritons and Lethe. Christophoros will be chased by the Apostate and the Cylonists. He will break the Chains of Time. Although he has powerful enemies, he has true friends and the support of the eternal Gaia and exotic Aphrodite to help him during his difficult quest!
Will Christophoros and his friends overcome the difficulties, beat the clock and bring  Poseidon’s Charm to the Ionian camp? Will they manage to save the Ionians from death?

Been said for the novel: 
 “The truth is that it is quite difficult to categorize the novel within young adults' literature. Is it a book of adventure? This is obvious! Is it a fantasy book? According to Darko Suvin, it surely is, since it offers an alternative to the global setting in which we live.  Is it science fiction? Of course, it is! Aliens, spaceships, physical laws and scientific principles extended. However, there are significant elements of historical fiction, too. Besides its precise references to historic events, according to many researchers, mythologies such as the Greek one, are actually the non-written history. Myths are nothing but the reflection, crystallization and condensation of historical narratives, accumulated in the collective memory of ancient societies and transmitted orally from one generation to another. Therefore, it is quite obvious that the Poseidon’s Charm is a brilliant, multifaceted novel,  a wonderful debut with just the right kind of plot twists that keep you turning pages!”   
  Alexis Kalesis, Doctor of Comparative Literature,  Professor, Journalist
“In the framework of the educational character of the novel, the writer intents to pass social messages such as love for the nature and the environment, the meaning of duty and solidarity with people, friendship, faith; I mean, besides the fantasy and the adventure, the Poseidon’s Charm  is a book to build character and teach our children significant values.  The book stimulates the mind, expands the vocabulary and exemplifies important viewpoints.”
                                    Evi Mpoumpoulis, MSc, Teacher of Primary Education
""With the Poseidon’s Charm, Glykeria Karagouni creates a strong, attractive novel with a cinematic flow for young – and not only – readers. She marries mythology with the contemporary life overtaking us with their masterful coupling   with future technology and the alien world as well as with deeper concerns and reflections… I would describe it as literature of high quality; it creates healthy moral and ethical patterns and presents valuable insights.""  Angeliki Anagnostou, Philologist & Artist

The why
I love fantasy novels. As a Greek woman, I have been living my whole life at the foothills of Mount Olympus, the home of the Greek gods, next to Mount Pelion with the Centaurs and close to Litochoro village with the strange, still-unexplained phenomena and the exceptional Aegean Sea. Inevitably, I grew up with the Greek myths and legends (and, oh my God!!! Greek mythology is vast and fascinating!). On the other hand, the marvels of Ancient Greek Technology and all those ancient Greek inventors like Archimedes and Heron inspired me to become a mechanical engineer.

I dreamed of a novel with a harmonious blend of adventure and Greek elements of mythology, tradition and history along with science fiction, aliens and alien technology. It is engaging and fascinating, with the Greek identity beyond doubt. 
The inspiration of this book came to me in 2005 when a Greek summer wind stumbled on the clear sea waters of Velika, Thessaly. The very first lines of the book describe the stormy sea of that day!

At once intensely Greek and cosmopolitan, full of adventures, filled with images of the Greek breeze, light and purity, the 340-page novel intends to immerse everyone- children, young adult and older readers- in intense action and illuminate the Greek spirit. Unimagined technology blends harmonically with the authentic Greek myth experience in its own home-place together with contemporary Greek culture and lifestyle. Traditions and local mores, religion, music, food and flavors, the stories and secrets of the Greek land and sea compose the background for this fantasy adventurous novel with its young heroes to live on the edge of myth and reality.
And yes! In Greece, one can never tell where fiction ends and where history begins…
I really hope the story and characters will capture the readers’ hearts!

Concret pour ne pas ennuyer les lecteurs, au ton léger pour rendre le sujet accessible, professionnel et référencé pour le rendre crédible aux yeux de tous.</div>

<h3>Pourquoi un Livret ?</h3>
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Vous êtes en week-end, en train de discuter en famille après un repas copieux. Comme souvent, après les discussions politiques arrive le débat sur l’âge de départ à la retraite et le « trou de la  sécu » sur lequel chacun donne son avis. Dans la conversation, vous expliquez avoir une protection sociale privée qui vous coute 10 fois moins cher. Face à vous, tatie Danielle, 72 ans, vous attaque frontalement : « La sécurité sociale est le meilleur système au monde, qui a d’ailleurs été créée par les résistants. Non seulement tu n’es pas solidaire, mais tu risques de finir en prison. Si on pouvait quitter la sécurité sociale, ça se saurait ! Combien êtes-vous à l’avoir quitté, d’ailleurs ? 472 ? J’ai entendu que des personnes ont été condamnées et qu’elles ont tout perdu du jour au lendemain. Si ça t’arrive, tu seras bien content de revenir dans le système-que-tout-le-monde-nous-envie ! ».</p>
<p>On pourrait continuer le discours pendant un moment, mais vous aurez compris le principe. Le livret vous permettra de fermer le clapet de tatie Danielle une bonne fois pour toute. Il répondra à toutes les bêtises habituelles, et donnera des sources, références et réponses claires pour ne pas remettre en cause son contenu.</p>
<p>Ce livret est aussi fait pour vos rencontres impromptues : <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">le commerçant du coin râle au sujet du RSI ? Vous avez certains collègues qui s’intéressent aux alternatives à la sécurité sociale pseudo-monopolistique française ? Le meilleur cadeau que vous puissiez leur faire, c’est le Livret de l’apprenti libéré. Glissez-leur le livret et laissez le temps agir. Les informations, chiffres, réponses et débats qu’il renfermera, avec des liens pour continuer l’exploration, leur permettra de s’intéresser au sujet, le dédiaboliser et à les soutenir dans l’approfondissement de leurs recherches d’information. Par la suite, vos contacts reviendront naturellement vers vous en étant plus attentifs, convaincus, et davantage ouvert d’esprit pour des échanges constructifs </span>sur le<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> sujet.</span></p>
<p>Tatie Danielle quant à elle n’aura plus le dernier mot lors des repas de famille.</p>

<h3>Pourquoi nous soutenir ?</h3>
<div>
<p>Simplement pour ce chiffre : <big>183</big>.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>183 indépendants ou petits patrons se suicideraient chaque année. D’autres sources évoquent des chiffres deux à trois fois plus élevés.</p>
<p>Chez Avenir Social, on est confronté à ce problème de manière hebdomadaire : les burnouts de certains de nos membres, les e-mails de demande d’aide, mais aussi et surtout l’incompréhension et la grande détresse des indépendants qui nous contactent. La situation nous révolte, et nous voulons agir. Pour les indépendants au bout du rouleau, pour nous, et pour que les 183 braves entrepreneurs qui mettent fin à leurs jours chaque année ne soient pas partis pour rien. Le système social intenable actuel doit cesser.</p>
<p>Si nous avons besoin de vous, c’est aussi parce que créer un Livret complet et professionnel, outre du temps de rédaction, ça demande une réelle maitrise pour le rendre crédible visuellement auprès des milliers de personnes qui l’auront dans leur main, dont une partie ne sera pas forcément convaincue au départ.

L'association locale Avenir Social Rhône-Alpes Auvergne (ASRA) avec l'aide du Mouvement des libérés ambitionne de créer le premier livret explicatif des enjeux de la liberté de protection sociale. Concret pour ne pas ennuyer les lecteurs, au ton léger pour rendre le sujet accessible, professionnel et référencé pour le rendre crédible aux yeux de tous.


Pourquoi un Livret ?

Vous êtes en week-end, en train de discuter en famille après un repas copieux. Comme souvent, après les discussions politiques arrive le débat sur l’âge de départ à la retraite et le « trou de la  sécu » sur lequel chacun donne son avis. Dans la conversation, vous expliquez avoir une protection sociale privée qui vous coute 10 fois moins cher. Face à vous, tatie Danielle, 72 ans, vous attaque frontalement : « La sécurité sociale est le meilleur système au monde, qui a d’ailleurs été créée par les résistants. Non seulement tu n’es pas solidaire, mais tu risques de finir en prison. Si on pouvait quitter la sécurité sociale, ça se saurait ! Combien êtes-vous à l’avoir quitté, d’ailleurs ? 472 ? J’ai entendu que des personnes ont été condamnées et qu’elles ont tout perdu du jour au lendemain. Si ça t’arrive, tu seras bien content de revenir dans le système-que-tout-le-monde-nous-envie ! ».
On pourrait continuer le discours pendant un moment, mais vous aurez compris le principe. Le livret vous permettra de fermer le clapet de tatie Danielle une bonne fois pour toute. Il répondra à toutes les bêtises habituelles, et donnera des sources, références et réponses claires pour ne pas remettre en cause son contenu.
Ce livret est aussi fait pour vos rencontres impromptues : le commerçant du coin râle au sujet du RSI ? Vous avez certains collègues qui s’intéressent aux alternatives à la sécurité sociale pseudo-monopolistique française ? Le meilleur cadeau que vous puissiez leur faire, c’est le Livret de l’apprenti libéré. Glissez-leur le livret et laissez le temps agir. Les informations, chiffres, réponses et débats qu’il renfermera, avec des liens pour continuer l’exploration, leur permettra de s’intéresser au sujet, le dédiaboliser et à les soutenir dans l’approfondissement de leurs recherches d’information. Par la suite, vos contacts reviendront naturellement vers vous en étant plus attentifs, convaincus, et davantage ouvert d’esprit pour des échanges constructifs sur le sujet.
Tatie Danielle quant à elle n’aura plus le dernier mot lors des repas de famille.




Pourquoi nous soutenir ?

Simplement pour ce chiffre : 183.


183 indépendants ou petits patrons se suicideraient chaque année. D’autres sources évoquent des chiffres deux à trois fois plus élevés.
Chez Avenir Social, on est confronté à ce problème de manière hebdomadaire : les burnouts de certains de nos membres, les e-mails de demande d’aide, mais aussi et surtout l’incompréhension et la grande détresse des indépendants qui nous contactent. La situation nous révolte, et nous voulons agir. Pour les indépendants au bout du rouleau, pour nous, et pour que les 183 braves entrepreneurs qui mettent fin à leurs jours chaque année ne soient pas partis pour rien. Le système social intenable actuel doit cesser.
Si nous avons besoin de vous, c’est aussi parce que créer un Livret complet et professionnel, outre du temps de rédaction, ça demande une réelle maitrise pour le rendre crédible visuellement auprès des milliers de personnes qui l’auront dans leur main, dont une partie ne sera pas forcément convaincue au départ. Cela nécessite aussi une somme d’argent minimum pour l’imprimer en de nombreux exemplaires et réaliser des économies d’échelle. Et on ne vous parle pas des frais de préparation et d’expédition.
Pour cela, nous avons besoin de vous pour lancer notre projet : si vous souhaitez amener une pierre à l’édifice, votre aide financière et votre bienveillance sont les bienvenues. Une fois créé, le Livret de l’apprenti libéré pourra être distribué à des coûts très faibles dans tout l’Hexagone et ses DOM-TOM, dans le but de démocratiser et rendre accessible des informations justes, claires et professionnelles.

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Story of My Book</h3>I’m Chasing Myself is about a young boy’s struggle to find the love and appreciation he once had about his life and how it’s unfolded in the home he has grown up in.<br/><br/>My name is Winona Rajamohan and I am the author of I’m Chasing Myself. I wrote this book because as a young adult, I had found myself losing sight of the excitement I once had about the world around me and the journeys that it could take me on. I’m born and raised in Malaysia, and the book takes place in a physical and cultural setting similar to the one in my home country.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will resonate with the rush of emotions you felt as you were growing up - the confusion, the uncertainty, the dwindling light at the end of the tunnel. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion that I have in showing young people how these feelings, though they often leave us scared and lost, are pivotal in helping us remember how important all the small things in life are. I want this book to help you embrace your struggles, and turn it into your own reflective art piece.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about the spontaneity of youth and its ambiguity.<p>It depicts how one can start to loathe the place that they grew up in, simply because it starts to look less interesting and more daunting.</p>
<p>It shows how life can become more colorful simply by stepping back and looking at a person, place or object that means something to you.</p>

He discovers a change within himself that he cannot describe, and the people around him feel those changes even more.<br/><br/><i><strong>Part 2: Chapter 5 - Chapter 7: Confronting the Misunderstandings</strong></i><br/>Jess finds himself face to face with the discomfort that he had been trying to suppress for so long.

<h3>About the Author</h3> Winona Rajamohan graduated from San Jose State University in Spring 2019 with a major in journalism and a minor in political science. She was born and raised in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and has made it her top priority to stand proud with her nationality and culture as she maneuvers through different newsrooms around the Bay Area with an international eye on how American law and policies affect the global community.<br/><br/>Before wanting to be a journalist, her love for literary expression started with an ambition to become a creative writer. As her passion for politics and human rights increased, she was exploring less of her wide imagination and appreciation for fiction. She wrote this to retrieve that passion in a way that drew influence from her love for her home country and how being a student halfway around the world on her own had affected her wonder and optimism toward the world.<br/><br/>For more information, you can connect with Winona at <u>winonarjmh@gmail.com</u> and <u>@winonarjmhnews on Twitter</u>.<p> </p>

</div></div>","Story of My BookI’m Chasing Myself is about a young boy’s struggle to find the love and appreciation he once had about his life and how it’s unfolded in the home he has grown up in.My name is Winona Rajamohan and I am the author of I’m Chasing Myself. I wrote this book because as a young adult, I had found myself losing sight of the excitement I once had about the world around me and the journeys that it could take me on. I’m born and raised in Malaysia, and the book takes place in a physical and cultural setting similar to the one in my home country.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will resonate with the rush of emotions you felt as you were growing up - the confusion, the uncertainty, the dwindling light at the end of the tunnel. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion that I have in showing young people how these feelings, though they often leave us scared and lost, are pivotal in helping us remember how important all the small things in life are. I want this book to help you embrace your struggles, and turn it into your own reflective art piece.In this book, you'll learn about the spontaneity of youth and its ambiguity.It depicts how one can start to loathe the place that they grew up in, simply because it starts to look less interesting and more daunting.
It shows how life can become more colorful simply by stepping back and looking at a person, place or object that means something to you.
It brings up the importance of family and friendship in shaping the building blocks of how someone appreciates the world, or gives up on it. You will love this book if you’re a young adult who has been affected by relationships with friends and family.I’m Chasing Myself is a fiction book that speaks to teenagers stepping into adulthood, young adults finding their place and adults who may forget what it’s like to reminisce.

<p><strong>A la deriva</strong> es una oda a la esperanza porque ―como decía Víctor Hugo― lo que a muchos les falta no son las fuerzas, sino la voluntad.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Carlos es el superviviente de un accidente aéreo cuando regresaba de un viaje laboral. Queda a la deriva en el mar. Su mujer, María, se entera de la noticia por la radio. Carlos y María, para no caer en la desesperación, se refugian, cada uno por su parte, en hacer un repaso de toda su vida mientras el tiempo va transcurriendo lentamente.</p>
<h3>¿Quiénes?</h3>
<p><strong>Tandaia </strong>es una editorial con voluntad de cambio, de dar la alternativa a autores que no la encuentran en otro lugar, con nuevas y refrescantes ideas como es el emplear una campaña preventa para valorar la aceptación y viabilidad de cada título.</p>
<p>De este modo eres tú, ahora que te estás planteando cómo colaborar, el que decide si la obra que te presentamos verá la luz pasando a formar parte de nuestro catálogo... porque consideramos al lector parte fundamental del proceso.</p>
<p>Hoy te presentamos a <strong>José D. Caballero</strong>.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Nacido en Madrid en 1958, es economista de profesión y ha desarrollado su carrera laboral en ese ámbito profesional. Su pasión por los libros y la literatura se inició en su infancia. Sus padres se encargaron de despertar esta afición que, estimulada durante el bachillerato por sus profesores de literatura, se vio reforzada años más tarde cuando ingresó en la Universidad. Esta circunstancia le permitió utilizar las instalaciones de la Biblioteca Nacional, tanto la Sala General como la Sala Universitaria, y le facilitó el acceso a los fondos de la Sección Circulante, cuya finalidad era el préstamo de libros.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Para él, un libro es una ventana abierta que, gracias al desarrollo de nuestra capacidad imaginativa, nos permite asomarnos a las vidas de otras personas y compartir sus experiencias, desplazándonos a cualquier lugar del mundo, real o ficticio, en cualquier momento del tiempo, pasado, presente o futuro.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">La creación pictórica y la literaria eran sus asignaturas pendientes en el ámbito de la expresión artística. Hace unos años se inició en el campo de la pintura, y la finalización de su primera novela le permitió cerrar el círculo de la satisfacción personal de sus inquietudes creativas. Esta experiencia le ha resultado extremadamente enriquecedora. De hecho ha finalizado su segunda obra, <i>Lesky versus Capitán</i>, y ya está trabajando en su siguiente novela.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">«Mis hijos. Luis y Ruth hicieron su aparición en un momento muy complicado de nuestra relación. Un hijo siempre te cambia la vida, pero dos hijos de golpe, y en aquellas circunstancias, fueron un auténtico terremoto.

Y eso por no hablar de las constantes dudas debidas a la inexperiencia, las noches sin dormir, los biberones, los pañales, los mocos, los baños, las comidas, los llantos, los gases, los primeros pasos, los dientes, las sonrisas, las fiebres, los enfados, los juegos… ¡Todo por duplicado y al mismo tiempo! Estábamos tan agobiados que no nos quedaba tiempo ni para respirar.<br/>          Teníamos que multiplicarnos por diez para poder atenderlo todo. El tiempo libre era un auténtico artículo de lujo. Fuimos capaces de superar esta etapa sobre todo gracias a la ayuda de mis suegros, y, en muy contadas ocasiones, gracias a la de mis padres. Excepcionalmente, también podíamos contar con Felisa, una buena vecina que era casi como de la familia. De no ser así habríamos enloquecido»</p>

I wrote this book because I wanted to understand ways to embrace using trash differently on our planet - and inspire others to do the same. Trash is damaging for our environment, our economy, and even our relationships, and learning how to combat the global pandemic of waste is vital for our continued success as humans.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover ways to embrace a ‘trashy’ mindset in your life - from changing your buying habits to starting your own ‘trashy’ business, there is no step too little or too large to take in changing our planet for the better. In this book, I want to share with readers the passion and excitement I have for trash. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you inspire others to change their trashy habits as well.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about our society's disposable mindset and how we can build a new economy that embraces trash as a resource instead of as waste:</p><ul>
<li>Patagonia - the global fashion retailer - has embraced a ‘trashy’ mindset by repairing and recycling all of its items to extend their life as long as possible.</li>
<li>Rust Belt Riders - who used their life experiences in a restaurant and a community garden to recognize the need for a composting service - and built a profitable, scrappy company around it.</li>
<li>Hungry Harvest - delivering ‘rescued’ produce right to your door - and to those who need it most.</li>
</ul><p>You will love this book if you are interested in having a positive impact on the world and finding a better way to use the trash we all create. Whether you are a student, entrepreneur, business or community leader, environmentalist, economist, or just curious to learn about a topic you know little about, join me on the journey to understanding how we can turn Trash to Treasure!</p><h3>The Book - Trash to Treasure</h3><p>The book is written in three Parts....<br/><br/>Part One contains the introduction + chapters one and two. This section works through our disposable mindset, how it came to be, and why we need to work to change our individual and collective mindsets around how we approach trash and our consumption. In short, why should we build things from trash?<br/><br/>Part Two contains chapters three through seven, focusing on the specific traits that ‘trashy’ entrepreneurs embrace and how they have utilized them in their lives and building their businesses. These founders epitomize traits that many founders have, such as grit and courage, but they also carry unique traits, such as a recognition of our interconnectedness and a unique scrappiness. They see trash not as something to be discarded, but as a goldmine, and there are ways we all can learn from that.<br/><br/>Part Three contains chapters eight through ten and provides a set of frameworks for implementing this mindset in different stages of life, from students, to career transitions, to community leadership, in order to apply these traits in daily life. We all have the opportunity to be ‘trashy’ - not in the way you are thinking haha - and this part is about finding the most authentic way for us to do this as individuals and a society.<br/> </p><h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3><p>This book will be published with New Degree Press.

 och mörka krafter möts i ett actionpackat rollspel som ställer spännande 
krav på spelarna, där ingen sida är svart eller vit.<br/></p><h1>Introduktion</h1><p>Starchallenge är ett klassiskt rymdoperarollspel som nu äntligen ska tryckas och ges ut. Författaren, Niklas Gerholm, har arbetat lite drygt 30 år på projektet. Spelet har under dessa år sakta men säkert tagit form och blivit väl genomarbetat. Under hela denna period har det varit Niklas dröm att ge ut spelet på något sätt. Det är denna dröm som du nu kan hjälpa honom att förverkliga.</p><p></p><p>I Starchallenge upplever du oräkneliga episka äventyr i en främmande 
galax fylld med fantastisk teknologi, ondskefulla främmande väsen, 
mystik och uråldriga krafter där ingen sida är helt ond eller god, och där fonden består av ett ödesdigert okontrollerbart hot.</p><p>Och
 vad du än tycker om det stora hotet, kommer det att påverka dig. Du kan
 välja att aktivt slåss tillsammans med de Äldste, lära dig kaotika och 
forska i<br/>bortglömda hemligheter för att försöka försegla de portaler 
som kontrollerar Kaos. Eller så kan du välja att spela oförstående inför
 hotet och se de Äldste och deras kamp som ett hot mot dina 
teknokratiska världar. Eller vill du hellre vara en av am Nachterinns 
folk? Ett folk som precis har frigjort sig från Utkants terror och nu 
hungrar efter ett nytt mäktigt rike och är beredd att ta till vilka 
medel som helst för att nå dessa mål? I postapokalyptiska världar eller i
 ockuperade riken i Stjärnvärlden kan du följa din härskarinna eller 
göra uppror mot henne och lägga under dig egna världar. Eller sluter du 
pakter med Kaos överstepräster? Kanske kämpar du på mörkrets sida?</p><p>Du
 kommer att spela actionfyllda och episka äventyr i primitiva såväl som 
teknokratiska världar, vilka antingen blomstrar eller har kollapsat. Du 
kan utnyttja krigen och motsättningarna i galaxen för egen vinning, som 
del av en av de många organisationerna, eller som legoknekt, 
droidjägare, mutantjägare, pirat, militär eller egenföretagare. Du kan 
spela kurir som ska föra topphemliga meddelanden på stjärndjur genom 
galaxen eller självständig hämnare som gör allt för att bekämpa Kaos 
överstepräster.</p><p></p><p>Spelet ges ut av MylingSpel och kommer att säljas i butik när det är färdigt. Lansering kommer att ske under påsk 2014, på GothCon i Göteborg. Chansen är stor att finansiärerna får spelet tidigare, eller till och med mycket tidigare.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/237417/files/20131202134003-Hunting_through_Nebula_By_MAW_copyright_2011.jpg?1386020403"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h1>Starchallenge</h1><p>Galaxen står inför sitt slutgiltiga öde. De två världarna som en gång levde sida vid sida splittrades för länge sedan då Kaos försökte 
förinta universum. Den gången stoppades den själlösa kraften av De 
äldste men Kaos lämnade kvar ett fåtal bortglömda krigare i en avlägsen 
del av galaxen. Där reproducerade de sig själva och har nu blivit så 
starka att de åter har öppnat portarna för Kaos in i galaxen. De äldste 
måste åter slåss mot de mörka makterna med magi och bortglömda krafter 
men mot dem står deras forna bröder och systrar som nu har bildat en 
egen provins tillsammans med en annan ras.</p><p>De har funnit 
teknologin på avlägsna platser och känner sig hotade av De äldstes 
försök att integrera världarna igen inför Kaos. Krig blossar upp och 
kriget föder ondska och ondska föder Kaos. De äldste står inför en 
omöjlig uppgift.</p>
<p>Där tar du dina första andetag. Välj sida och övertygelse. Vem vill 
du tjäna? Någon annan, något eller dig själv? Galaxen med alla dess 
avkrokar, magiska platser, framtida teknokratvärldar, mörker och
ljus väntar på dig i ditt livs största äventyr: Starchallenge.</p>
<p></p><p><span><span></span></span><b>Spelvärld – Galaxen Solhem: </b>Traditionell
fantasy möter postapokalyps och rymdopera. Rymdopera är en lättare form av
scifi, där realism och vetenskap får stå tillbaka till förmån för action och
äventyr. I de utvecklade världarna finns snabba rymdskepp, svävare,
automatvapen, kanoner, supermetropoler och högteknologi. Andra riken är
utbrända och där hittar man mörka världar med mutanter, hopplockad teknologi,
märkliga fynd, stora organisationer som styr solsystem och en tro hos
civilbefolkningen på en bättre värld. Och från fjärran tid men idag ytterst
levande, står de äldsta världarna med sina djupa hemlighetsfulla skogar, berg,
grottor, tempel, gravkummel, odöda, skepp som seglar i rymden längs solleder,
stjärnriddare, överstepräster, nationalism och hämndbegär mot krigiska
teknokratvärldar.<span>  Äventyren i Solhem
bygger på intressekonflikter som direkt eller indirekt bygger på Kaos.
Världarna hålls samman av ett invecklat politiskt spel om riken, evigheten och
Kaos där missförstånd, makt, hämnd och insikter blandas om vartannat. <br/></span></p>

<p><span><span></span></span><b>Berättande: </b>Berättandet är i fokus.
Spelreglerna ger olika personer kontroll över vem som berättar vad i historien.
Spelsystemet består av enkla regler som inte stoppar upp berättandet.</p>
<p><span><span></span></span><b>Snabbt och enkelt: </b>Spelet är tempofyllt. Alla
konflikter och handlingar som en spelare tar sig för går snabbt. </p>
<p><span><span></span></span><b>Kreativt:</b> Reglerna uppmuntrar spelarnas
kreativa förmåga. </p>
<p><span><span></span></span><b>Detaljismen är nedtonad:</b> Realismen i reglerna
är nedtonad till förmån för ett snabbt spel. Ett exempel är att man inte räknar
hur många kulor man avlossat i en strid. Istället kan ammunitionen ta slut när
som helst.</p>
<p><span><span></span></span><b>Alla är med:</b> Tanken är att varje spelare ska
få så mycket speltid som möjligt och inte sitta och vänta medan andra spelare
får allt fokus. </p>
<p><span><span></span></span><b>Pulshöjande moment: </b>Spelaren måste ibland vara
på alerten, vara uppmärksam och agera fysiskt vid spelbordet. Prestationerna
sker ofta inom en tidsram som sätter press på spelaren. </p>
<p><span><span></span></span><b>Valfri dödlighet: </b>Döden är ständigt närvarande
för spelarnas roller men spelarna har alltid en möjlighet att undvika döden. En
möjlighet som inte alltid är att föredra.</p>
<p><span><span></span></span><b>Spelledarbeslut: </b>För snabbt spel och för att
inte ha allt för mycket regler är en del beslut upp till spelledaren. Det är
bra om det finns ett förtroende och “ha kul framförallt”-tänk i spelgruppen. </p><p><b>Regler: </b>Regelsystemet bygger på tärningspölar där 4+ räknas som lyckat. Vid ett slag satsar spelaren tärningar och delar upp dem på att lyckas med slaget och på hur lyckat slaget ska vara. Konfliktreglerna hanteras med spelkort och tärningsslag när en kombattant har chansen att avgöra striden. Ett system för fordons- och rymdstrid finns naturligtvis med. Det tvingar spelare att
samarbeta under en tidspress och ställer krav på lyhördhet och beslutsförmåga.<br/></p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/237326/files/20131202130720-reemonk6_2.jpg?1386018440"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/><h1>Finansiering och belöningar</h1><p>Som tack för hälpen med 
finansieringen får du en belöning. Det handlar i huvudsak om 
Starchallenge som bok eller PDF, plus bonusmålen som anges nedan. Den 
som är intresserad av annat kan även hjälpa till med finansieringen 
genom att lägga pengar på våra övriga spel, här tillgängliga i spelpaket
 för en förhållandevis billig penning.</p><p>Du tjänar dessutom på att lägga pengar på spelet nu istället för i framtiden. Dels får du det lite billigare, och dels har du chansen att få tag i del saker som inte kommer att finnas till försäljning längre fram.<br/></p><p>I grunden kommer spelet att vara en bok i US letter-format med limbindning och mjuka pärmar. 
Inlagan kommer att vara svartvit. Vissa bonusmål förbättrar bokens 
kvalitet och kan ge sådant som färginlaga för alla och hårda pärmar.</p><p>En av perk-nivåerna i högerspalten kan behöva nämnas extra. Det är 
samlare, en nivå för den som vill ha en eller flera prylar med grafik 
eller bilder från spelet. Lägg ihop summan för det du vill ha, lägg till
 grundsumman på 8 euro (frakten) och betala in. Se till att inte glömma 
bort att skriva ned vad du vill ha så att du kan meddela oss det efter 
projekttiden.</p><p>Allt levereras efter projekttiden. I de fall då det 
handlar om produkter under utveckling kommer de att levereras när de är 
färdiga.</p><p>Det är fullt möjligt att lägga pengar på flera perks (finansieringsnivåer).</p><p><b>Observera! </b>Spelet kommer att tryckas oavsett om målet nås eller inte. Du förlorar därmed inte dina pengar om du finansierar och målet sedan inte nås. Du kommer att få ditt spel oavsett hur crowdfundingen går!<br/></p><h3>Presentkort</h3><p></p><p>För att göra det lättare för dig att ge bort Starchallenge som julklapp till någon som du älskar har vi nu skapat ett presentkort som du får hemskickat innan jul. Även om spelet dröjer till påsk kan du med andra ord ändå få något att lägga under granen.</p><p>Vill du ha ett presentkort skickar vi ut ett speciellt kort i fyrfärg med mottagarens namn och vad hon får.</p><p>För att få presentkortet gör du enligt följande:<br/></p><ul>
<li>Välj perk och betala som vanligt.</li>
<li>Skicka, så som möjligt, ett mail till: info@mylingspel.se<br/>
</li>
<li>I mailet skriver du ditt namn, vilket perk som du har köpt, vad presentkortets mottagare heter, mottagarens adress samt vart presentkortet ska skickas.</li>
<li>Ska presentkortet skickas till dig, för att du ska kunna ge bort det personligen, måste du med andra ord inkludera din adress också.</li>

 händer då om målsumman nås? Då är det dags att börja låsa upp alla 
trevliga bonusmål, sådant som specialdesignade spelhjälpmedel och en mer
 högkvalitativ bok.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/278389/files/20131225141120-stretchgoals1.jpg?1388009480"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Bonusmål baserat på antal finansiärer</h3><p>Även
 antalet finansiärer ger ett fåtal bonusmål. Stödjer tillräckligt många 
spelet kommer vi att ha möjlighet att lägga till ett par extrasaker. Även Woho-nivån räknas in i detta.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/278401/files/20131225142209-stretchgoals2.jpg?1388010129"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Facebookmål</h3><p>Ju fler som gillar <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/mylingspel"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">MylingSpels facebooksida</a>, desto fler småsaker och extra tävlingar kommer att låsas upp.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/290947/files/20140104094707-stretchgoals3.jpg?1388857627"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><h3>Tävling</h3><p>Dessutom
 kommer vi att köra en tävling under hela projekttiden. Den som drar in 
mest pengar till projektet genom att få andra att hjälpa till med 
finansieringen vinner ett fint pris. Detta görs genom referering via 
twitter, facebook och andra ställen.</p><p>Den som får flest personer att besöka projektsidan genom referering vinner också ett fint pris.</p>Båda
 vinnare får lika mycket som de har lagt själva på 
Starchallengeprojektet att köpa annat för i MylingSpels butik. En 
vinnare som har lagt totalt 80 euro på Starchallenge-perks 
(finansieringsnivåerna ute till höger) får med andra ord motsvarande 
summa i svenska kronor att lägga på andra produkter, direkt eller i 
framtiden. Detta kan görs online eller på GothCon. Vinner du båda

</ul></div>","Vill du rollspela i en värld med samma känsla som i Star Wars? Då kan Starchallenge mycket väl vara något för dig! I Starchallenge hotas universums existens. Scifi, fantasy, postapokalyps
 och mörka krafter möts i ett actionpackat rollspel som ställer spännande 
krav på spelarna, där ingen sida är svart eller vit.IntroduktionStarchallenge är ett klassiskt rymdoperarollspel som nu äntligen ska tryckas och ges ut. Författaren, Niklas Gerholm, har arbetat lite drygt 30 år på projektet. Spelet har under dessa år sakta men säkert tagit form och blivit väl genomarbetat. Under hela denna period har det varit Niklas dröm att ge ut spelet på något sätt. Det är denna dröm som du nu kan hjälpa honom att förverkliga.I Starchallenge upplever du oräkneliga episka äventyr i en främmande 
galax fylld med fantastisk teknologi, ondskefulla främmande väsen, 
mystik och uråldriga krafter där ingen sida är helt ond eller god, och där fonden består av ett ödesdigert okontrollerbart hot.Och
 vad du än tycker om det stora hotet, kommer det att påverka dig. Du kan
 välja att aktivt slåss tillsammans med de Äldste, lära dig kaotika och 
forska ibortglömda hemligheter för att försöka försegla de portaler 
som kontrollerar Kaos. Eller så kan du välja att spela oförstående inför
 hotet och se de Äldste och deras kamp som ett hot mot dina 
teknokratiska världar. Eller vill du hellre vara en av am Nachterinns 
folk? Ett folk som precis har frigjort sig från Utkants terror och nu 
hungrar efter ett nytt mäktigt rike och är beredd att ta till vilka 
medel som helst för att nå dessa mål? I postapokalyptiska världar eller i
 ockuperade riken i Stjärnvärlden kan du följa din härskarinna eller 
göra uppror mot henne och lägga under dig egna världar. Eller sluter du 
pakter med Kaos överstepräster? Kanske kämpar du på mörkrets sida?Du
 kommer att spela actionfyllda och episka äventyr i primitiva såväl som 
teknokratiska världar, vilka antingen blomstrar eller har kollapsat. Du 
kan utnyttja krigen och motsättningarna i galaxen för egen vinning, som 
del av en av de många organisationerna, eller som legoknekt, 
droidjägare, mutantjägare, pirat, militär eller egenföretagare. Du kan 
spela kurir som ska föra topphemliga meddelanden på stjärndjur genom 
galaxen eller självständig hämnare som gör allt för att bekämpa Kaos 
överstepräster.Spelet ges ut av MylingSpel och kommer att säljas i butik när det är färdigt. Lansering kommer att ske under påsk 2014, på GothCon i Göteborg. Chansen är stor att finansiärerna får spelet tidigare, eller till och med mycket tidigare.
StarchallengeGalaxen står inför sitt slutgiltiga öde. De två världarna som en gång levde sida vid sida splittrades för länge sedan då Kaos försökte 
förinta universum. Den gången stoppades den själlösa kraften av De 
äldste men Kaos lämnade kvar ett fåtal bortglömda krigare i en avlägsen 
del av galaxen. Där reproducerade de sig själva och har nu blivit så 
starka att de åter har öppnat portarna för Kaos in i galaxen. De äldste 
måste åter slåss mot de mörka makterna med magi och bortglömda krafter 
men mot dem står deras forna bröder och systrar som nu har bildat en 
egen provins tillsammans med en annan ras.De har funnit 
teknologin på avlägsna platser och känner sig hotade av De äldstes 
försök att integrera världarna igen inför Kaos. Krig blossar upp och 
kriget föder ondska och ondska föder Kaos. De äldste står inför en 
omöjlig uppgift.
Där tar du dina första andetag. Välj sida och övertygelse. Vem vill 
du tjäna? Någon annan, något eller dig själv? Galaxen med alla dess 
avkrokar, magiska platser, framtida teknokratvärldar, mörker och
ljus väntar på dig i ditt livs största äventyr: Starchallenge.
Spelvärld – Galaxen Solhem: Traditionell
fantasy möter postapokalyps och rymdopera. Rymdopera är en lättare form av
scifi, där realism och vetenskap får stå tillbaka till förmån för action och
äventyr. I de utvecklade världarna finns snabba rymdskepp, svävare,
automatvapen, kanoner, supermetropoler och högteknologi. Andra riken är
utbrända och där hittar man mörka världar med mutanter, hopplockad teknologi,
märkliga fynd, stora organisationer som styr solsystem och en tro hos
civilbefolkningen på en bättre värld. Och från fjärran tid men idag ytterst
levande, står de äldsta världarna med sina djupa hemlighetsfulla skogar, berg,
grottor, tempel, gravkummel, odöda, skepp som seglar i rymden längs solleder,
stjärnriddare, överstepräster, nationalism och hämndbegär mot krigiska
teknokratvärldar.  Äventyren i Solhem
bygger på intressekonflikter som direkt eller indirekt bygger på Kaos.
Världarna hålls samman av ett invecklat politiskt spel om riken, evigheten och
Kaos där missförstånd, makt, hämnd och insikter blandas om vartannat. 

Berättande: Berättandet är i fokus.
Spelreglerna ger olika personer kontroll över vem som berättar vad i historien.
Spelsystemet består av enkla regler som inte stoppar upp berättandet.
Snabbt och enkelt: Spelet är tempofyllt. Alla
konflikter och handlingar som en spelare tar sig för går snabbt. 
Kreativt: Reglerna uppmuntrar spelarnas
kreativa förmåga. 
Detaljismen är nedtonad: Realismen i reglerna
är nedtonad till förmån för ett snabbt spel. Ett exempel är att man inte räknar
hur många kulor man avlossat i en strid. Istället kan ammunitionen ta slut när
som helst.
Alla är med: Tanken är att varje spelare ska
få så mycket speltid som möjligt och inte sitta och vänta medan andra spelare
får allt fokus. 
Pulshöjande moment: Spelaren måste ibland vara
på alerten, vara uppmärksam och agera fysiskt vid spelbordet. Prestationerna
sker ofta inom en tidsram som sätter press på spelaren. 
Valfri dödlighet: Döden är ständigt närvarande
för spelarnas roller men spelarna har alltid en möjlighet att undvika döden. En
möjlighet som inte alltid är att föredra.
Spelledarbeslut: För snabbt spel och för att
inte ha allt för mycket regler är en del beslut upp till spelledaren. Det är
bra om det finns ett förtroende och “ha kul framförallt”-tänk i spelgruppen. Regler: Regelsystemet bygger på tärningspölar där 4+ räknas som lyckat. Vid ett slag satsar spelaren tärningar och delar upp dem på att lyckas med slaget och på hur lyckat slaget ska vara. Konfliktreglerna hanteras med spelkort och tärningsslag när en kombattant har chansen att avgöra striden. Ett system för fordons- och rymdstrid finns naturligtvis med. Det tvingar spelare att
samarbeta under en tidspress och ställer krav på lyhördhet och beslutsförmåga.Finansiering och belöningarSom tack för hälpen med 
finansieringen får du en belöning. Det handlar i huvudsak om 
Starchallenge som bok eller PDF, plus bonusmålen som anges nedan. Den 
som är intresserad av annat kan även hjälpa till med finansieringen 
genom att lägga pengar på våra övriga spel, här tillgängliga i spelpaket
 för en förhållandevis billig penning.Du tjänar dessutom på att lägga pengar på spelet nu istället för i framtiden. Dels får du det lite billigare, och dels har du chansen att få tag i del saker som inte kommer att finnas till försäljning längre fram.I grunden kommer spelet att vara en bok i US letter-format med limbindning och mjuka pärmar. 
Inlagan kommer att vara svartvit. Vissa bonusmål förbättrar bokens 
kvalitet och kan ge sådant som färginlaga för alla och hårda pärmar.En av perk-nivåerna i högerspalten kan behöva nämnas extra. Det är 
samlare, en nivå för den som vill ha en eller flera prylar med grafik 
eller bilder från spelet. Lägg ihop summan för det du vill ha, lägg till
 grundsumman på 8 euro (frakten) och betala in. Se till att inte glömma 
bort att skriva ned vad du vill ha så att du kan meddela oss det efter 
projekttiden.Allt levereras efter projekttiden. I de fall då det 
handlar om produkter under utveckling kommer de att levereras när de är 
färdiga.Det är fullt möjligt att lägga pengar på flera perks (finansieringsnivåer).Observera! Spelet kommer att tryckas oavsett om målet nås eller inte. Du förlorar därmed inte dina pengar om du finansierar och målet sedan inte nås. Du kommer att få ditt spel oavsett hur crowdfundingen går!PresentkortFör att göra det lättare för dig att ge bort Starchallenge som julklapp till någon som du älskar har vi nu skapat ett presentkort som du får hemskickat innan jul. Även om spelet dröjer till påsk kan du med andra ord ändå få något att lägga under granen.Vill du ha ett presentkort skickar vi ut ett speciellt kort i fyrfärg med mottagarens namn och vad hon får.För att få presentkortet gör du enligt följande:
Välj perk och betala som vanligt.
Skicka, så som möjligt, ett mail till: info@mylingspel.se

I mailet skriver du ditt namn, vilket perk som du har köpt, vad presentkortets mottagare heter, mottagarens adress samt vart presentkortet ska skickas.
Ska presentkortet skickas till dig, för att du ska kunna ge bort det personligen, måste du med andra ord inkludera din adress också.
Finansiella BonusmålVad
 händer då om målsumman nås? Då är det dags att börja låsa upp alla 
trevliga bonusmål, sådant som specialdesignade spelhjälpmedel och en mer
 högkvalitativ bok.Bonusmål baserat på antal finansiärerÄven
 antalet finansiärer ger ett fåtal bonusmål. Stödjer tillräckligt många 
spelet kommer vi att ha möjlighet att lägga till ett par extrasaker. Även Woho-nivån räknas in i detta.FacebookmålJu fler som gillar MylingSpels facebooksida, desto fler småsaker och extra tävlingar kommer att låsas upp.TävlingDessutom
 kommer vi att köra en tävling under hela projekttiden. Den som drar in 
mest pengar till projektet genom att få andra att hjälpa till med 
finansieringen vinner ett fint pris. Detta görs genom referering via 
twitter, facebook och andra ställen.Den som får flest personer att besöka projektsidan genom referering vinner också ett fint pris.Båda
 vinnare får lika mycket som de har lagt själva på 
Starchallengeprojektet att köpa annat för i MylingSpels butik. En 
vinnare som har lagt totalt 80 euro på Starchallenge-perks 
(finansieringsnivåerna ute till höger) får med andra ord motsvarande 
summa i svenska kronor att lägga på andra produkter, direkt eller i 
framtiden. Detta kan görs online eller på GothCon. Vinner du båda 
tävlingsmoment innebär det att du får dubbla din lagda summa att 
spendera på våra produkter.Niklas Gerholm, Tina Engström och Jörgen Åkerklint kan ej vinna denna tävling.

Vad pengarna går tillPengarna som vi får in kommer i första hand att gå till tryckkostnader 
för spelet och medföljande färgkarta. I andra hand kommer pengarna att 
användas till bonusmål och betalning av sådant som behövs under 
tillverkningen. Eftersom MylingSpel är ett litet företag hjälper vartenda
 öre som vi får in. Detta är också orsaken till att vi även erbjuder 
våra övriga produktlinjer här. Så ta gärna chansen att fynda kompletta 
spelpaket till billiga priser. Skulle något bli över kommer det att gå till framtida produktutveckling.Spelpaketens inverkan på StarchallengeDu kan lägga 
pengar på ett antal olika kompletta spelpaket som inte har med 
Starchallenge att göra. Detta är Leviathan, 
Skuggornas mästare, Bortom, Pirater! och En Garde! III.Observera att
 pengarna som kommer in från dessa går till utvecklingen av Starchallenge. De läggs med andra ord undan tryck och andra kostnader, och kommer inte att användas till annat av MyligSpel. Och 
för den som undrar är detta, enligt IndieGoGos regler, en fullt tillåten
 metod att dra in extra finansiering.FramtidsplanerI framtiden kan spelet komma att översättas till engelska och det finns
 också möjligheter till en eller flera romaner som utspelar sig i 
galaxen. För närvarande arbetar Niklas med en roman i thrillermiljö som 
förhoppningsvis når diskarna om några år.Regelboken till Starchallenge är komplett och innehåller allt som du kan tänkas behöva under spel. Romanerna bygger dock på spelvärlden och kan användas som inspiration och informationskällor. Säljer de kommer sannorlikt även extra supplement till spelet att ges ut. Och skulle fans av spelet skriva bra äventyr eller annat innan dess ger vi gärna ut även dem.Gruppen bakom StarchallengeDet är främst Niklas som har arbetat med spelet, men nu i slutfasen är även MylingSpel och Tina Engström inblandade.Niklas GerholmStarchallenge är det enda spel som Niklas har skrivit på under modern tid.

<h3>
<br/>Sustainability</h3>
<div>
<p>Earlier this year, we sold 150 hand silk screen ceramic ETE plates. We loved them, but we knew we could do better. We wanted to use a material with less impact on our environment, which is why our new ETE plates are made of 95% bamboo fiber. </p>
<p><b>Why bamboo?</b></p>
<p>Bamboo is the fastest growing woody plant in the world (growing up to 4 feet per day!) and it releases 35% more oxygen than an equivalent stand of trees. In addition, harvesting bamboo is a much better alternative to destroying native forests as tree plantations have to be chopped down to be harvested, but bamboo just keeps growing and can be re-harvested within five years.</p>
<p><i><b>Not easy to break </b>- In case you drop it on the floor, it won’t shatter or chip.</i></p>
<p><i><b>Dishwasher safe </b>– Easy to clean.</i></p>
<p><i><b>Biodegradable </b>– At the end of it’s life, ETE is naturally compostable, resulting in less environmental damage due to landfill waste (but don’t worry, as long as you don’t bury your plate in soil, you’ll be able to use it as long as you want!)</i><br/> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><b>Social Good</b></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>At the end of our campaign, we’ll be donating one plate for every ten sold to a high school or academic institution chosen by our supporters, as we want to help foster healthy habits from an early age. </p>
<p>When we reach our first 100 sales, the first 10 donated (donETE'd!) plates will go to the Yulius Academy from Rotterdam, the Netherlands. After these first 10 are given away, the other ETE plate donations will still need a loving home. If you'd like some free ETE plates for your favourite school or institution, please fill in our form to <a href=""http://goo.gl/forms/Eisdz5FNx9"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">indicate</a> your interest! <br/> </p>

Nudge your portions with ETE
 
 
It’s all too easy to load up our plates and eat more than what we need.
In fact it’s been shown that we can eat 30% more when offered a large portion compared to a smaller portion despite feeling similarly full*.We created ETE because we want to help nudge people into eating portions of each food group that are neither too large, nor too little, but just right. 
 

 
Look who's talking about ETE!

How ETE works
 
Designed based on US and EU nutritional guidelines, ETE can be used for a meal made up of protein, vegetables and starch.
Fancy steak and chips for dinner? Sure thing. ETE’s colored lines guide you into serving just the right amount, along with your recommended portion of veggies for your meal. 
 How about a tofu and vegetable stir fry? Great choice. Place your stir fry between the blue lines, your rice/noodles between the yellow, and some extra salad between the orange lines.
 

There’s always an empty spot for you to shuffle your food around! (although you may keep it neat: it has been shown that a neatly presented meal tastes better*).

</div></div>","My Story:

Greetings!
My name is Novuyo Masakhane and I am the author of House of Jewels.
House of Jewels is a love story between two souls.    It is the telling of my relationship with my Aunt Canis` spirit and the impact her restless soul has had on my life. It is my need to know what happened in the fall of 1955.   As a child I heard bits and pieces of my aunt's story that always began with murder.  Her death appeared in several news papers across the country and in many cases it became front page news. The novel is a fictional story based in truth, written in two time lines.  China and Alonzo are trying to work out their love affair with the challenge of living in different cities and balancing their emerging careers.  We travel back in time to the 1940s with Byrd as she aspires to become a famous dancer only to be met with a life she's not prepared for.This novel documents history of a rich and endearing people both past and present, not just how they got by, but how they thrived.  It's an inquiry into African American organized crime in the 1940's and 1950's.  This is a novel about both my family's history and an essential part of America's rich and diverse cultural history. 
I'm in the last stretch of this work.  I have been writing through all of my research and discoveries for seven years.... and now I need to finish and move into the next phase which is  publishing.  But to do so, I need your help.
What We Need & What You Get
Writing is most often a solitary act, and now with Indiegogo it becomes a collaborative effort between me and you. Your collective contributions will,  1: allow me to work and complete this book.   2: take a 10 day trip to Cleveland, Ohio: to do research that is crucial for completing and revising. A walk through my Aunt's life and death in Cleveland. 3:  pay for the first and second edit of the full manuscript with a professional editor.4: Purchase Photo and video equipment: I will document my trip to Cleveland,  through  photographs and video.   Two excerpts of 'House of Jewels' have been published and I have performed public readings both on the west coast and here in Texas.On the right of this page you will see the list of perks you will receive with your pledge!  All donations will help us reach our total. While large donations are a blessing, I believe that ultimately, many small donations will play a key role in making the difference towards achieving our goal!!!Thank you so much for your support, for visiting my page.  Every click, every share helps the project, please share with friends.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><em>Freedom From Within: Christian Self-help For New Perspectives In Overcoming Negative Thoughts</em> is a step-by-step 3-part book by a man who hit bottom and discovered how to come out on top. Publisher Fresh Ink Group agrees to subsidize worldwide print and e-book distribution on major platforms at a very affordable cover price, but author needs help with set-up costs. This project offers a chance to help others learn how to overcome problems and live positive, productive lives in the light of Christian faith and personal responsibility. It also presents a wonderful opportunity for donors to share their own Inspiring Thoughts in a book treasured around the world. Below you will read examples of the many ways donors can share their messages, including dedicating to family members, memorializing, promoting ministries and websites, telling one’s own story, thanking others, and encouraging a favorite Christian act.</p>

<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">The Book</span></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Freedom From Within: Christian Self-Help For New Perspectives In Overcoming Negative Thoughts</em> is built upon the lessons discovered in the struggles of a man defeating addiction, suicidal thoughts, and a lengthy prison term—a former liar and thief and cheat who lost everything and everybody, then discovered with hard work how to change his thinking and achieve his goals.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The book is divided into three sections: “The Challenge of Thought: Overcoming a Negative Outlook”; “The Beginner’s Mind: How We View The World Around Us”; and “Finding Out The Truth: Who We Really Are As Christians”. Each section is divided into chapters that explain important concepts, offer examples, suggest steps for achieving goals, and cite supporting scriptures as well as the stories and advice of others who have traveled similar roads. 21 Daily Affirmations are included for those who might benefit from declaring the new perspectives for achieving the potential wonder and joy we all deserve.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“The Challenge of Thought: Overcoming a Negative Outlook” includes chapters on Making the Decision; Tearing Down the Barriers; Lest We Judge; View; Seeing Ourselves as God Sees Us; Confession, The Faith-Builder; Hope to the End; Attitude; Unfailing Love; Don’t Get Discouraged; Reality Check; Thinking Errors; Anger Will Distort Your Thoughts; Ready to Soar; Who’s on the Throne; and 21 Daily Affirmations.</p>
<p> </p>

Publisher Fresh Ink Group agrees to subsidize worldwide print and e-book distribution on major platforms at a very affordable cover price, but author needs help with set-up costs.

The Book
 
Freedom From Within: Christian Self-Help For New Perspectives In Overcoming Negative Thoughts is built upon the lessons discovered in the struggles of a man defeating addiction, suicidal thoughts, and a lengthy prison term—a former liar and thief and cheat who lost everything and everybody, then discovered with hard work how to change his thinking and achieve his goals.
 
The book is divided into three sections: “The Challenge of Thought: Overcoming a Negative Outlook”; “The Beginner’s Mind: How We View The World Around Us”; and “Finding Out The Truth: Who We Really Are As Christians”. Each section is divided into chapters that explain important concepts, offer examples, suggest steps for achieving goals, and cite supporting scriptures as well as the stories and advice of others who have traveled similar roads. 21 Daily Affirmations are included for those who might benefit from declaring the new perspectives for achieving the potential wonder and joy we all deserve.
 
“The Challenge of Thought: Overcoming a Negative Outlook” includes chapters on Making the Decision; Tearing Down the Barriers; Lest We Judge; View; Seeing Ourselves as God Sees Us; Confession, The Faith-Builder; Hope to the End; Attitude; Unfailing Love; Don’t Get Discouraged; Reality Check; Thinking Errors; Anger Will Distort Your Thoughts; Ready to Soar; Who’s on the Throne; and 21 Daily Affirmations.
 
“The Beginner’s Mind: How we View The World Around Us” includes chapters on Your Mind, The Enemy; In the Day of Battle; My Brain Is Screaming: The Victim Mentality; We Can Make a Difference; Who Is Your Lion?; You Are Who You Hang With; Are You Holding Back?; Who Are You When You’re Alone?; Come to My Relief; Chief Cornerstone; Judging Unfairly; Remembering Days Gone By; All My Days Have Been Ordained Of God; Search Me, God; Is the Poison on Their Lips or Ours?; Set a Guard Over My Mouth; He Can Never Be Praised Enough; The Lord Is Good to Everyone; Don’t Put Your Confidence In People; He Heals the Broken-hearted; God Is Not Impressed; Proud Versus Humble; Is My God Money and Things?; Thou Doest Know; and Conclusion.
 
“Finding Out The Truth: Who We Really Are As Christians” includes chapters on The Gospel; Spirit, Soul, and Body; Who We Are Before Christ; Spirit Man; Mind of Christ; Perspective; Temptation; Temptation Part II; and Acceptance.
 
Freedom From Within helps everybody—from those suffering great challenges to everyday folks who aspire to live ever-happier lives. It focuses on the thinking errors that trap us all in ways from subtle to obvious, and gently guides us with the tools to take control and set positive examples for everyone as we walk with God.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The betrayal of Family is a story I have been writing for the past 14 months. The premises of the story is very unusual yet equally as unique. It encompasses an extremley dark &amp; sinister theme and will certainly not be for the faint hearted reader. </p>
<p>It follows Joshua, a young boy kidnapped in the middle of the night. He awakes in a foreign place and is soon to find out that his parents and younger sister have been brutally murdered. His journey to the truth charts his path over the next 20 years.</p>
<p>The book keeps you guessing at every turn, the main plot works in sync with many further sub plots and as the characters evolve we learn more of the sickening truth Joshua so depserately yearns for. </p>
<p>The book is comprised of two Acts, essentially two endings. </p>
<p>Act 1 draws an end to the story you begin reading immediately from Chapter 1 and is a valient ending in it's own right. </p>
<p>Act 2 is the overall story I wanted to tell, compiling every element throughout the book and bringing them together in an explosive ending and of course, the biggest twist of them all. </p>
<p>This book lies dear to my heart, not because of all the back breaking effort that has been poured into collating the tale, but because I sincerely believe the story is ""one of a kind"" and would be very successful in the writing industry and enjoyed by millions globally given the oppourtunity. </p>
<p>Your investment is paramount to the future success. It will die a quiet death if I cannot secure the funding to take ""The betrayal of Family"" to the next level and beyond and I feel this would be a devasting blow to creativity everywhere. . . . </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need your help!!</p>
<p>I need to raise £2,600 to add to the £2,400 of my own savings. This will then allow me to make the book a reality. Any contribution (no matter how small) will make a massive difference. </p>
<p>This amount covers everything from Professional editing to publishing, global marketing to electronic device compatibility, 100 copies in both hard &amp; paper back to professional book reviews around the world. </p>
<p>But as always in this life, I do not expect something for nothing. </p>
<p>I want you to be rewarded for your generosity, so in return you will get some fantastic perks. These will include having your very own character named after you in the book, whose mannerisms, expressions and actions will be dictated by you, giving you your very own part of history. Personalised signed copies of the book. Dinner with the author in a Michelin stared restaurant in central London, where we can discuss anything you may like, be it my book or the latest Twilight (if you really insist) </p>
<p>If we do not reach the entire goal, all proceeds will go to the final amount required to make the above happen. I will just keep working 6 days a week and saving every dime to ensure our goal is reached asap. </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We don't require just money, although it is a high priority. </p>
<p>There are a million ways people can help. I have absolutely no idea about the literary world, anyone with any advice, tips or contacts would be sincerely appreciated. </p>
<p>You may have a friend who is a publisher? You may be able to offer your indepth knowledge on writing? There really is a number of things which could be a huge impact on the finished product and of course your efforts will equally be rewarded. </p>

<h2>Dogs Playing Poker, Sample:</h2>
<p>Barking dogs woke me.</p>
<p>I don’t mean little yappy dogs, but big, Nazi, bite-your-balls-off, German Shepherds, Pit Bulls, and mean, starving sons-of-bitches.</p>
<p>Fortunately these demon-dogs were locked in cages stacked two high to my left. I was in Carl’s old hospital, not my favorite place. The lime-green walls were caked with rust, mold, and what I guessed were long streaks of blood. My eyes followed the streaks around the room to a man crammed into a dog cage.</p>
<p>The man was wearing a blue suit, no shirt, no shoes. “He wouldn’t get service at 7-11,” I remember thinking. His hand had been cut off and a dog was lapping at the stump. With the morphine they’d shot into me this all seemed perfectly normal. Yeah, just perfect.</p>
<p>Over my head was a surgeon’s lamp. On the wall to my right, opposite of the barking dogs, there was a long table of torches, hammers, pliers, and a chainsaw. I knew what those were for. I’d seen Carl and Percy use those on what they called “clients.” Even through the drugs I knew that I was their new client.</p>
<p>I tried to sit up but my head was pounding. It was then I realized that I was in a straightjacket. My left arm ached and I could see that blood had soaked through the canvas. On my chest was someone’s foot.</p>
<p>Minus the leg.</p>
<p>Minus the body.</p>
<p>Just a foot.</p>
<p>My eyes darted to the man in the cage. Nope. Lucky bastard had both feet. My eyes drifted back to the foot on my chest. I could see the jagged edges of bone, hair, and yellowed toenails that needed a trim. I looked down and I couldn’t see my feet. My legs from just above the knees down to my feet were secured in some kind of a steel box.</p>
<p>I thought, “Did I need to trim my toenails? Is this my foot?”</p>
<p>Then I remembered the dream: A white rabbit with a chain saw. Carl tap dancing feet on my chest. And stacks of pancakes?</p>
<p>Then I remembered something not from the dream: “AJ,” Carl said, “AJ, where’s Zoe?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know-ie,” I said.</p>
<p>Miss Emma, morphine, worked my mind; they’d definitely given me too much. I remember the pancakes, the tap dances, the man with one hand, and Carl and Percy arguing.</p>
<p>Carl and Percy were gone. Why? It wasn’t their style to leave a client unattended. Had I said something about the money?</p>
<p>I couldn’t remember what I did or didn’t say, but I remembered Carl jabbing something into my left arm. A sewing needle? Yes, I’d seen him do this trick before. A needle? Doesn’t sound too bad, does it?</p>
<p>Let’s play.</p>
<p>Look at your left arm, nice and meaty, right? Good. Now imagine you have something Carl wants to know and you don’t want to tell Carl.</p>
<p>Big mistake.</p></div>","Short Summary

I tried to sit up but my head was pounding. It was then I realized that I was in a straightjacket. My left arm ached and I could see that blood had soaked through the canvas. On my chest was someone’s foot.
Minus the leg.
Minus the body.
Just a foot.
My eyes darted to the man in the cage. Nope. Lucky bastard had both feet. My eyes drifted back to the foot on my chest. I could see the jagged edges of bone, hair, and yellowed toenails that needed a trim. I looked down and I couldn’t see my feet. My legs from just above the knees down to my feet were secured in some kind of a steel box.
I thought, “Did I need to trim my toenails? Is this my foot?”
Then I remembered the dream: A white rabbit with a chain saw. Carl tap dancing feet on my chest. And stacks of pancakes?
Then I remembered something not from the dream: “AJ,” Carl said, “AJ, where’s Zoe?”
“I don’t know-ie,” I said.
Miss Emma, morphine, worked my mind; they’d definitely given me too much. I remember the pancakes, the tap dances, the man with one hand, and Carl and Percy arguing.
Carl and Percy were gone. Why? It wasn’t their style to leave a client unattended. Had I said something about the money?
I couldn’t remember what I did or didn’t say, but I remembered Carl jabbing something into my left arm. A sewing needle? Yes, I’d seen him do this trick before. A needle? Doesn’t sound too bad, does it?
Let’s play.
Look at your left arm, nice and meaty, right? Good. Now imagine you have something Carl wants to know and you don’t want to tell Carl.
Big mistake.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><i>The Land Drenched in Tears</i> is a moving history of the tumultuous years of modern China under Mao’s rule, witnessed, experienced, and told through the personal lens of an ethnic minority woman, who endured nearly 20 years imprisonment and surveillance regime as a result of her political activism in Xinjiang, or East Turkistan, located in the far west of China.</p>
<p>Writing her autobiography as an extraordinary melange of diary and memoir, which oscillates between first-hand narrative and flashback, the author, Söyüngül Chanisheff, traces her unfortunate youth from her university years, when she founded the East Turkistan People’s Party as a result of her anger and frustration with communist China’s devastating mishandling of the socio-economic life of the people of her native land, through her subsequent imprisonment in China’s notorious labour camps as well as under the surveillance regime, to her emigration to Australia.</p>
<p>Chanisheff’s autobiography is a rare, detailed, and authentic account of one of the most poignant and most fascinating periods of modern China. It is a microcosmic reflection of the communist regime’s tragic realities presented through the suffering and hope of a young woman who tied her fate to that of her beloved homeland. By boldly exploring hidden territories of modern Chinese history, it not only invites the reader to contemplate the universal topics, such as the relationship between citizen and state as well as between ethnic minority and majority, but also encourages similar stories to be told from our troubled contemporary world. This book is highly recommended for anyone who seeks to gain a deeper understanding of the many issues contemporary China faces.</p>

<p><strong>My Story</strong></p>
<p><i>A Mixing Pot of Poems For Thought</i> is a book of rhyming poetry about the process of finding oneself through love, heartbreak, and simple experiences that make us all human.<br/><br/>My name is Lauren Stikeleather and I am the author of <i>A Mixing Pot of Poems For Thought</i>. I wrote this book because I grew up loving rhyme and have developed a passion for rhyming poetry over the years . This is a skill I have honed for a long time and want to share with the world. However, I have found that the majority of the adult world doesn’t believe rhyming can be a mature genre of reading, and I want to prove that it can be. Additionally, I wrote this book to convey the many lessons I have learned over the years from my life experiences, which I feel that I express uniquely due to the nature of my writing.<br/><br/>My hope is that, by reading this book, you will discover that we all have a lot more in common than we think. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to engage with certain unspoken truths in our society and discover the wonders of rhythm and rhyme in poetry.<br/><br/>In this book, you’ll join me in using language to render distinct aspects of love and growth through poems like:</p>
<p>“One and the Same,” which talks about how we are all so similar in desiring love, but also in our fear of it. I like this piece because it’s about the process of learning that we are independent in our journey, but never alone. At some point, we all will inevitably collide with someone who is a kindred spirit, solely because we know ourselves and what we want. This poem emphasizes the best kinds of growth and discovery.</p>
<p>“Done” is the ultimate “strike back” poem. It’s about no longer tolerating negative treatment from anyone, romantic or otherwise. So much of what this poem contains are things I’ve heard people close to me say at one point or another—it’s a poem of utter frustration, but also growth. This piece’s rhythm helps build the message as it flows, and the ending is pointed: I’m done. This is one of the most relatable poems in the whole book.</p>
<p>“Smartest Person In The Room” is a poem that’s quite timely, especially for younger generations. It’s about defining intelligence in a less conventional form: being people-smart. I think this poem demonstrates an alternate perspective on humanity and empathy and highlights the very high value of being able to read a room of people and navigate it correctly. It’s a synthesis of things I’ve learned and observed from people in my life doing things both right and wrong, and it’s a perspective I believe to be vital to have.</p>
<p><br/><strong>You will love this book if...</strong></p>
<p>You like to relate to the work that you read. This book is meant for anyone, but the first few sections focus on the experiences of young adult women in the modern world. I personally love reading things that make me feel like I’m not alone in what I’m feeling, so if you’re that kind of person, this book is 100% for you. You’ll also love it if you love rhyme and rhythm, and consistency in tone. Also, if you like work that is direct yet still requires some deep thinking, you will really enjoy this book. I personally struggle to interpret certain kinds of poetry, so I’ve written mine in a straightforward manner that still contains deeper meaning — a happy medium of sorts.<br/><br/><i>A Mixing Pot of Poems For Thought</i> speaks to young adults who want to grapple with developing societal norms and optimism in a new way.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that <i>A Mixing Pot of Poems For Thought</i> inspires reflection and dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p>
<p>How can I change my perspective from half empty to half full?</p>
<p>What are the parts of people I’m not seeing by just looking at them?</p>
<p>Why are we so narrow-minded in the way we perceive emotion?</p>
<p>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Book Structure</strong></p>
<p><i>A Mixing Pot of Poems For Thought</i> is written in 2 Parts:<br/><br/><i>Part I: The Ingredients</i> contains the introduction and Chapters 1-3: 1) Discovering Sweet, 2) Tasting the Salt, 3) Adding the Spice. This part will discuss how love grows and develops in many ways and is everything but straightforward. It’s a process that takes time and involves getting to know yourself before getting involved romantically with someone else. Although relationships can end in heartbreak, which can hurt, over time, this leads to empowerment and the discovery of new kinds of strength.<br/><br/><i>Part II: The Cooking</i> contains Chapters 4 and 5: 4) Stirring in Savory and 5) Creating New Recipes. This part will show how we are all tied together by how we experience the world, and how much of our happiness is contingent on our ability to understand both ourselves and other people simultaneously. Additionally, it touches on how life is full of so many small, good things, and that there is so much living to do every day.</p>
<p><strong>What I Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:</p>

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<p><i>My Unremarkable Brain: Adventures in Fitness, Health and Epilepsy</i> tells the stories of people with chronic conditions who are thriving and living their best lives thanks to real food and a healthy lifestyle.<br/><br/>My name is David Robinson and I am the author of <i>My Unremarkable Brain</i>. When I was diagnosed with epilepsy, I wanted to find the best way to live and thrive with my condition.  This book is the result of that journey.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover your own path to optimal health. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for food and health. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you live your best life.<br/><br/>You'll learn about how I discovered the link between lifestyle and health by talking to people like:</p>
<ul>
<li><font>Jim Abrahams, the Hollywood producer whose discovery of the ketogenic diet in an obscure medical textbook led to an end to his son's seizures, and a revolution in epilepsy patient care</font></li>
<li>Krishna Kaliannan, an entrepreneur who was able to turn his diagnosis into a successful food company with millions of dollars in annual revenue</li>
<li>Dr, Eric Kossoff, a leading voice of the ketogenic diet in the epilepsy community</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if, like me, you love food, you want to be healthy, or you’re just sick of “sick care” and ready for a revolution in health care.<br/><br/><i>My Unremarkable Brain</i> is a non-fiction book that speaks to any of the 60% of Americans who are living with chronic disease, and anyone who’s interested in cutting through the hype and finding a path to better health and their best lives.</p>
<h3>The Book - <i>My Unremarkable Brain</i>
</h3>
<br/>The book is written in 3 Parts.<br/><br/>Part 1, “Fat on the Body,” is the story of how, in middle age, I became a “fathlete,” a serial dieter, and how I finally found a better way to eat and live. It also gives readers insights into the scam-ridden world of the weight-loss industry, and timeless wisdom for eating well.<br/><br/>Part 2, “Fat on the Brain,” is about how I discovered the Ketogenic diet, a now-popular “fad diet” that has been helping people with epilepsy for 100 years, yet is still largely unknown, even to many neurologists. It gives an overview of the science and history behind the Ketogenic diet and tells the stories of those who bucked the system and used food to live fuller, more confident lives.<br/><br/>Part 3, “Fat on the Mind,” analyzes the lessons that I’ve learned along the way, and addresses some of the myths about diet and health that pervade our culture. It gives readers information and inspiration that they can use to find their own path to optimal health, wellness, and happiness.<br/> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3>
<br/>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:<br/> <ul>
<li>The Editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in December, 2020.</li>
<li>The Cover Design of my Book - the mockups you see currently are a placeholder!</li>
<li>The Layout Design for the interior of my book (Physical Copy, Ebook Formats)</li>
<li>The Copyediting for My Book - to help polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication (you know, all that English-y stuff)</li>
<li>The Launch &amp; Promotion Efforts for my book - when I ultimately publish this winter</li>
<li><strong>Once these costs are covered, any funds raised will go to The Charlie Foundation for Ketogenic Therapies</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When I pre-sell 120 copies of my book ($5,000), I will publish.</p>
<p>When I pre-sell 155 copies of my book ($6,000), I will also publish a hardcover edition. <br/><br/>I am also offering some <strong>exclusive rewards</strong> for people who pre-order my book now. When I publish, you will receive the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A personally signed copy of my book </li>
<li>Personal, handwritten thank you note for pre-ordering my book</li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><br/>My name is Linda Saether and I am the author of The Angel of the Penny Rose. My inspiration for this book was one sentence I recalled from a historical tour of old St.Augustine, Florida, a long time ago. It was related to the treatment of widows without means, who were told to remarry within sixty days, or be sent back to England on the next ship to arrive. Need I say that seafaring in those days was challenging, at best? But, as I said in the video, this is only the beginning.</p>
<p>The story starts in the 1760s when Anna meets Edmund Ashton in her father’s apothecary. He is a doctor headed to St. Augustine, East Florida to take on a post at the infirmary, and Anna is intrigued by the thought of everything he will learn in this new world. As a girl, she can’t become an apothecary, but she is probably the best one in London, for her father taught her well. Before Edmund sets out for the Americas, Anna becomes his bride, and they leave England full of hopes and dreams for a life of adventure and discovery, but before they set foot in their new home of St. Augustine, their journey teaches them unexpected lessons that will lead to tragedy, sending Anna into a world of deceit and treachery that she has no choice but to face, but does she have the courage to reach for her hearts true desire?</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You'll Get</strong></h3>
<p>This book will be published with New Degree Press. Their team has been outstanding in making all this possible, and helping me make my book the best it can be. It would be fantastic to repay some of their efforts with a truly great pre-launch, which will occur as book sales rise and supporters join us!  </p>
<p>Money raised will go towards the following:<br/>- The editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in August, 2021.<br/>- The final cover design of my book. <br/>- The layout design for the interior of my book (physical copy, ebook formats).<br/>- The copy editing for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.<br/>- The launch &amp; promotion efforts for my book when it is ultimately publish this fall, 2021.</p>
<p><br/>Publication will take place in stages, so when we pre-sell <strong>120 copies</strong> of my book, we will publish a <strong>paperback and ebook.</strong> When we pre-sell <strong>150 copies</strong> of my book, we will also publish an <strong>audiobook! </strong>When we pre-sell <strong>200 copies </strong>of my book, we will publish a <strong>hardcover!</strong><br/><br/>I am also offering some <strong>exclusive rewards</strong> for people who pre-order my book <strong>now</strong>:</p>
<p>You will receive a personally signed copy of my book when it is published.</p>
<p>Your name could appear in the Acknowledgments section of my book.</p>
<p>You will receive early access to the Author’s Note and other excerpts from my book, with the opportunity to review it and give me feedback before the last edit.</p>
<p>You will have the opportunity to be involved in selecting my cover. It takes more than a pretty picture!</p>
<p>You will be invited to join my Author Community and get behind-the-scenes sneak peeks into the publishing process.</p>
<p>And much more!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>A challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the buyers, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by including the cost of mailing and shipping the signed copies within the US into each pre-order tier.  </p>
<p>I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure the pre-order rewards come to you as early as possible. We will keep all pre-sale buyers up-to-date as to when my book will publish, and we will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.</p>
<p> Should we for any reason not meet our goals during this campaign, we will continue marketing and fine-tuning the book until publication day to make sure you will be among the first to receive the book, and in the meantime our journey will continue.</p>

My inspiration for this book was one sentence I recalled from a historical tour of old St.Augustine, Florida, a long time ago. It was related to the treatment of widows without means, who were told to remarry within sixty days, or be sent back to England on the next ship to arrive. Need I say that seafaring in those days was challenging, at best? But, as I said in the video, this is only the beginning.
The story starts in the 1760s when Anna meets Edmund Ashton in her father’s apothecary. He is a doctor headed to St. Augustine, East Florida to take on a post at the infirmary, and Anna is intrigued by the thought of everything he will learn in this new world. As a girl, she can’t become an apothecary, but she is probably the best one in London, for her father taught her well. Before Edmund sets out for the Americas, Anna becomes his bride, and they leave England full of hopes and dreams for a life of adventure and discovery, but before they set foot in their new home of St. Augustine, their journey teaches them unexpected lessons that will lead to tragedy, sending Anna into a world of deceit and treachery that she has no choice but to face, but does she have the courage to reach for her hearts true desire?
 
What We Need & What You'll Get
This book will be published with New Degree Press. Their team has been outstanding in making all this possible, and helping me make my book the best it can be. It would be fantastic to repay some of their efforts with a truly great pre-launch, which will occur as book sales rise and supporters join us!  
Money raised will go towards the following:- The editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in August, 2021.- The final cover design of my book. - The layout design for the interior of my book (physical copy, ebook formats).- The copy editing for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.- The launch & promotion efforts for my book when it is ultimately publish this fall, 2021.
Publication will take place in stages, so when we pre-sell 120 copies of my book, we will publish a paperback and ebook. When we pre-sell 150 copies of my book, we will also publish an audiobook! When we pre-sell 200 copies of my book, we will publish a hardcover!I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:
You will receive a personally signed copy of my book when it is published.
Your name could appear in the Acknowledgments section of my book.
You will receive early access to the Author’s Note and other excerpts from my book, with the opportunity to review it and give me feedback before the last edit.
You will have the opportunity to be involved in selecting my cover. It takes more than a pretty picture!
You will be invited to join my Author Community and get behind-the-scenes sneak peeks into the publishing process.
And much more!

Risks & Challenges
A challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the buyers, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by including the cost of mailing and shipping the signed copies within the US into each pre-order tier.  
I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure the pre-order rewards come to you as early as possible. We will keep all pre-sale buyers up-to-date as to when my book will publish, and we will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.
 Should we for any reason not meet our goals during this campaign, we will continue marketing and fine-tuning the book until publication day to make sure you will be among the first to receive the book, and in the meantime our journey will continue.

Other Ways You Can Help
Some people just can't buy the book now, or join my team, but that doesn't mean they can't help:
Please share my pre-sale campaign on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn with your friends, family and network. Please use #theangelofthepennyrose and tag me as well as my publisher, New Degree Press, so we can help amplify your efforts.
You can easily share my Pre-Sale Campaign Page via Indiegogo at the top of the page.
Please share my book with 5 friends or more, family members, or co-workers who you think would enjoy it via text or direct message on social media.
And that's all there is to it!
Thank you so much for of all of your love and support.

<p><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;"">Dreams of a African Boy</span><br/></p> <p></p>
<p>My name is Mawuna Koutonin. I'm the founder of Silicon  Africa. I was born in a family where neither my father or my mother could read or write. It happened that when I was 7 my parents go divorced, and I was left with my father who owned a small retail shop in the center of our village. My father wanted me to spend time with him, but like most traditional fathers, he never knew what to tell me when we sat together except when he would spot an opportunity to lecture me.</p>
<p>From 7, unlike the other children in my village, I’d spend most of my time reading behind my father's shop counter.  Sometimes, I’d suddenly emerge, and stretch my body to relax my muscles. Those sudden “emergencies” from behind the counter got me the most famous nickname in the village “The Hippopotamus”.</p>
<p>Yeah, at that age I’d absorb anything in print that I could find. There were barely enough books in my village for my voracious reading appetite. I was even able to finish the whole Bible (more than 1000 pages), which in fact was the easiest book to get because it was the only gift the German missionaries never forgot to bring with them in their numerous visits.</p>
<p>For me, school was the most boring thing that ever happened to me, but I have to admit that the only virtue I found in school was putting together people who are hungry to learn, and accidentally some good teachers who could point the children into the right direction.</p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>Our stories written by others </h3> <p></p>
<p>I remember that in school we were taught examples of the advantages of colonization for Africa. Because the books were written by Europeans they portrayed themselves as the saviour of the African, bringing them to civilization and enlightenment. However, I’d later learn the real story of Africa, which was not taught at all, and found out that colonization was mainly a looting system designed to steal and exploit the local people and their resources.</p>
<p>So, the question is Why aren’t Africans writing more books for themselves?</p>
<p>Currently only 2% of the content written on Africa and about Africa is produced by Africans. 98% is done by non-Africans, which means Africans see themselves mainly trough the eyes of outsiders. This is the reason why it's important that we empower more content creation by our people with more diversity.</p>
<p>With less than 2% of the narratives on Africa written by Africans for Africans, everywhere I turn, I see a huge demand for local content. From local movie production to local artists focusing their work on ordinary African people. </p>

<p>I’ve put up my money, and dedicated countless hours to write articles. Any single article you read on Silicon Africa takes 3 to 5 hours to be completed after the story has been researched. I personally write from 2 to 3 articles a week. No one is paid for writing for Silicon Africa, all the work is done</p>
<p>benevolently.</p>
<p>With that dedication, Silicon Africa became the most influential blog in Africa during the last 12 months, and every day we reach several thousands of African entrepreneurs, activists and Africans in the diaspora. And some our articles have been translated into Lingala, Swahili, Chinese, Japanese, French, and Arabic.</p>
<p>The day is coming where Africans will not feel the need to listen to the BBC, CNN, RFI and all of the other foreign media, but will be happy to have good local content, where the joy of reading and learning will return to every African family.<br/></p>

My name is Mawuna Koutonin. I'm the founder of Silicon  Africa. I was born in a family where neither my father or my mother could read or write. It happened that when I was 7 my parents go divorced, and I was left with my father who owned a small retail shop in the center of our village. My father wanted me to spend time with him, but like most traditional fathers, he never knew what to tell me when we sat together except when he would spot an opportunity to lecture me.
From 7, unlike the other children in my village, I’d spend most of my time reading behind my father's shop counter.  Sometimes, I’d suddenly emerge, and stretch my body to relax my muscles. Those sudden “emergencies” from behind the counter got me the most famous nickname in the village “The Hippopotamus”.
Yeah, at that age I’d absorb anything in print that I could find. There were barely enough books in my village for my voracious reading appetite. I was even able to finish the whole Bible (more than 1000 pages), which in fact was the easiest book to get because it was the only gift the German missionaries never forgot to bring with them in their numerous visits.
For me, school was the most boring thing that ever happened to me, but I have to admit that the only virtue I found in school was putting together people who are hungry to learn, and accidentally some good teachers who could point the children into the right direction.
   Our stories written by others  
I remember that in school we were taught examples of the advantages of colonization for Africa. Because the books were written by Europeans they portrayed themselves as the saviour of the African, bringing them to civilization and enlightenment. However, I’d later learn the real story of Africa, which was not taught at all, and found out that colonization was mainly a looting system designed to steal and exploit the local people and their resources.
So, the question is Why aren’t Africans writing more books for themselves?
Currently only 2% of the content written on Africa and about Africa is produced by Africans. 98% is done by non-Africans, which means Africans see themselves mainly trough the eyes of outsiders. This is the reason why it's important that we empower more content creation by our people with more diversity.
With less than 2% of the narratives on Africa written by Africans for Africans, everywhere I turn, I see a huge demand for local content. From local movie production to local artists focusing their work on ordinary African people. 
  A first step, some little effort with fruit  
I started Silicon Africa 4 years ago with the firm intention to bring new perspectives to the African narrative, but also to empower a new generation of Africans with a higher level of awareness about the world in which we live.
I’ve put up my money, and dedicated countless hours to write articles. Any single article you read on Silicon Africa takes 3 to 5 hours to be completed after the story has been researched. I personally write from 2 to 3 articles a week. No one is paid for writing for Silicon Africa, all the work is done
benevolently.
With that dedication, Silicon Africa became the most influential blog in Africa during the last 12 months, and every day we reach several thousands of African entrepreneurs, activists and Africans in the diaspora. And some our articles have been translated into Lingala, Swahili, Chinese, Japanese, French, and Arabic.
The day is coming where Africans will not feel the need to listen to the BBC, CNN, RFI and all of the other foreign media, but will be happy to have good local content, where the joy of reading and learning will return to every African family.

Our goal now is to continue this work but bigger, better and stronger, with the purpose to cover more countries in Africa and subjects. But, in order to do so, we need your help. I’m asking you to make a donation to Silicon Africa to help us continue.“It does not require a majority to prevail, but rather an irate, tireless minority keen to set brush fires in people’s minds..” - Samuel Adams“Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter. - Martin Luther KingIf you believe in what we are doing, and you want to help us continue, use the form below to make a donation.Our Goals Isn't SiliconAfrica like any other blog? No. We are not in the business to please advertisers in order to make money but to change lives in Africa, to empower our people to become self-reliant, to challenge the state quo. Here are messages from our readers:

So to find your site is fantastic. "" - Pippa Lawton

As an Entrepreneur myself, I see so many gaps for wealth creation and development with employment opportunities for African youths. SiliconAfrica, keep it up.

Don't stop talking plssssss."" - Sandra Onarii Opusunju
""Thanks once more Mawuna for this stimulation and empowerment. You need to go on air with this brother, more people should become aware. We need strong African Presses that will serve solely to debunk the lies of Western press, and also go further to bring forward rich and inspiring information such as this to all of Africa. You can ask for funds and I will give without thinking! I salute you all my fellow Africans. Thanks again Mawuna"" - Thomas Ngonde
""Since I started browsing the web whenever I read a good article I try to share with my friends, talk about the article, discuss about in the occasions but never tried to write to the author (I am lazy!). This time I must write.
After reading two of your articles, I just couldn't do my ordinary tasks rather busy on thinking and sharing with friends.
Thank you very much for the invaluable information. Please keep on feeding with such priceless information to wake up others. You better run faster, if you can write books, before you die.

He is the creator and writer of Max’s Midnight Movies, an AXN Original Production of a twenty-six-part TV series about cult cinema classics. Meanwhile, in the guise of character actor, Young has shown up in movies and TV series such as <i>Dracula, Fleming, </i>and <i>Houdini</i>. As reflected in Chronicle One of his Wild Cats trilogy, his written work is often inspired by Eastern and Central Europe as a wellspring of myth and legend, fairy tales, and horror stories. In his side career as a travel writer, Young has been everywhere from Alaska to Buenos Aires, Hawaii to Florence. And, of course, Piran.</p><p><b>ABOUT THE ILLUSTRATOR</b></p><p>From his studio in Trento, northern Italy, the abundantly talented Swiss/Italian artist Moreno Chistè has produced thousands of lively and colorful illustrations for companies such as Disney, Warner Bros, and Mattel. His work ranges from comics to advertising artwork, storyboards, merchandising, and entire collections of greeting cards for the major European card companies.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><h2>Risks and challenges</h2><p>Well, the book has been printed and is set for distribution.

This includes Facebook and other social media outreach and ads, a well-targeted print ad or two, mail copies of the book to a good number of online reviewers we haven't been able to do a mailing to so far, and outreach to libraries and schools (including book donations). What is left over will go toward covering the very modest hourly wage of our currently 10 hour/month (that's right--a month; such is our budget) bright young assistant, the incomparable Christopher Hantman, over the next couple of months as he works to help publicize <i>Wild Cats</i>.</p><p><b>(2) The other half:</b></p><p>- Half of it will help cover the first portion of the advance Scott will get under contract for writing of the Chronicle 2!

WHAT is your purpose? Have you been looking for answers?
Two years ago, I was at the lowest in my life – reduced to a man who had only 12 dollars in his wallet, was not sure of where my health was going, and had lost a significant relationship.
It was enough for me to question my direction in life and I had no answer to that.
Until someone asked me, “Do you truly know who you are?” That question stuck to me till today and I started to dig deep within me to answer it. I started to make decisions in life based on my inner self, realizing how important it was to understand yourself truly and knowing your purpose in life.
Over the course of time, I have been (and still am) on the road to my self-discovery. This book talks about my journey.
The story is placed in a fictional setting and yet based on real events that has happened in my life as well as other people’s.The reason why this is fictional is because in general, a person’s mind work best when reading a story. A story leads us to input our emotions and consciousness into it. That is why we can cry or laugh when reading a story.And it is during the state of reading a story that we start to ask questions and get engaged more into the plot. From there, we develop our own theories and solutions to issues.This is why Finding Home Inside is not only a story about me and the people I have met, it is also a story about you.And the story that you yourself will create after that.Learn more about the book. Click for a sample chapterIf you like what you see here, please support The first phase of the book has already completed.

If you are a male of color you are YOUNG MEN STRONG and may have an opportunity to share your story, if you know of a young man of color you can help him to strengthen his self-esteem by reading, learning, and communicating with other young men just like him doing exceptionally well and making a difference in society despite the odds, inspiring him to do the same. If you are a woman, you get to better understand the whys and how’s of males of color, if you are a part of society, then it helps you to be aware, open and more understand regarding the value of Celebrating Our Men Everyday.

You are valuable to YOUNG MEN STRONG, LLC.

<p>Founded in 2002, <a href=""http://www.peacexpeace.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Peace X Peace</a> serves 20,000 women in 125 countries. Our programs promote gender equity and peacebuilding through leadership development, mentorship, public policy, and intercultural dialogue. We give strength and unity to women’s voices and dynamic trainings to engage them as peacemakers within their countries. Peace X Peace collaborates with the United Nations, fosters international peacebuilding, increases trust and reduces stereotypes across cultural and religious boundaries worldwide.</p>
<p>We serve as a first tier publisher for women around the world whose voices would not be heard otherwise. And, we have a history of bringing women around the world together in dialogue to overcome stereotypes and bridge cultural misunderstandings. In 2006 we hosted the Women’s Global Roundtable that brought together 20 women from three African countries, four countries in the Middle EAst and three Asian countries in private facilitated conversations; we created a handbook of best practices for cross cultural dialogues based on this experience. In 2007 we hosted in-person dialogue among an equal number of Israeli and Palestinian women, again private and facilitated to discuss their vision of peace for their region.</p>
<p>The Embassy of the United Arab Emirates partnered with <a href=""http://www.peacexpeace.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Peace X Peace</a> by providing seed funding for the launch of <strong>The Connection Point initiative</strong> in January 2011, which works to break down stereotypes and misunderstandings between Arab, Muslim, and Western women.

<p>This Campaign has been developed specifically to address a growing global need for person to person dialogue. The <strong><a href=""http://www.peacexpeace.org/connection-point/cp-dialogues/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Connection Point Dialogues</a></strong> is a program that utilizes videoconferencing to facilitate vital cross-cultural discussions between women from Arab, Muslim, and Western communities around the world. The demand for the Connection Point Dialogues from women around the world has been exceptional. Currently, we have a waiting list of 100 women who would like to join our spring 2013 online dialogues.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>As many of you may know (or not know), I have been diagnosed with chronic renal failure.  I have a disease called igA nephropathy, which is associated with inflammation in the kidneys.  When first diagnosed in 2011 our family quickly accepted the diagnosis; yet we were unprepared for the struggles we would soon face.  With igA your kidney function fluctuates rapidly and without reason.  After being pumped with thousands of medications, transfusions, and even six months of cytoxan infusions, we still have not recovered. However, my body appeared to cooperate for a brief period until the past year.  Within this past year my symptoms have increased and become more aggressive.  I occasionally black out, have chest scares, and swollen appendages (edema).  I also have thrown up violently everyday for an entire year.  We have exhausted all our options and began accepting this lifestyle.  We also have an entire team of specialists in every field working on my case.  Our next step is dialysis and transplant.  However, as we wait for the solution I would like to lead a somewhat normal life.  I am a biology major and thorougly enjoy my classes at FAU.  It has become difficult to maintain any sense of independence throughout this ordeal.  The doctors briefly mentioned the assistance of a certified service dog, and before we knew it an idea was born.  This particular dog would be trained to assist in medical situations by alerting others and providing stability.  He will be able to sense changes in blood levels and anxiety.  The dog will also be able to retrieve medication and appropriate tools that I cannot physically gain access too.  The best part is that I will not have to worry anymore about having a violent episode in public because I will always have someone with me who knows what to do, without an ounce of panic.  I know that I can beat this disease, but I cannot do it without the help of others (even canines).</p>
<p> <strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The cost of this entire process will come out to $5300.  However, I plan on breaking the goals down into smaller protions, as to not become overwhelmed or discouraged.  It appears to be a significant amount, but this dog will not be a pet.  He will be a certified service dog and provide the role of a caretaker.  It is importnat to understand that his services are unique and often come with a price.  There are many nonprofit agencies that provide free service dog, but many are associated with wait lists that can take up to years.  Unfortnately we need these services now, in an attempt to lead a somewhat normal life.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This particular act will potentially change my life.  I will be able to continue my education and travel alone without worrying about my 'black outs'.  I also will be able to give my family and friends a break from their roles as caretaker.  As many of you may know, this role can be exhausting and often overwhelming.  I will be able to accomplish a sense of normalcy again.  This will also benefit myself and a dog who would not have a home.  This process will allow  rescue to become adopted, trained, and lead a successful life.  He will have a forever home and be able to work hard, sharing his skills with others.  I promise that all of the donations are specifically for this cause and will not be used for any other purpose.  I also want others to know that these funds will only cover the beginning of a long road ahead.  Our family will cover the extra costs that are essential to maintain/ utilize this special service.  We are simply asking for the opportunity to begin this unique journey.</p>

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<p>The world has a lot of problems (definitely more than 99), but luckily, biotechnology offers the most significant opportunities to help solve them. <strong><u>There is hope!</u></strong><br/><br/>And the best way to create the better future you wish to see (and add to that hope) is to be a part of shaping it. This is exactly what Gene-trepreneur is about: expanding your knowledge base and joining a community coming together to tackle some of the world's toughest sustainability problems, deliver incredibly beneficial impacts, and add to the hope!<br/><br/><strong>Positive change</strong> is sprouting up all around us from rapid technological advancements that are cultivating powerful outcomes in our food system, human health, and species / environmental conservation. Those who take the reigns and become a part of the amazing changes happening now and to come are simultaneously building themselves and the world around them into something we all want to be a part of. I invite you to join the movement and learn along with me how we can deliver the impact we wish to see in the world.<br/><br/>My name is Brett Cotten, and I am the author of <i>Gene-trepreneur: How Synthetic Biology &amp; Sustainability Founders are Saving the World + How to Join the Cause to Deliver Your Impact</i>.</p>
<p>I wrote this book to enhance public understanding and scientific literacy in regards to the immense positive effects that synthetic biology and sustainability startups, and the founders behind them, are having on the <u>greatest challenges the world currently faces (factory farming, species extinction, human health, ocean pollution, climate change, etc.)</u>. My book displays the interconnectedness between all these issues and shows how everyone can become a Gene-trepreneur amongst the infinite ways there are to become one (and in your own, unique way too).<br/><br/>My hope is that through reading this book, you will <strong>discover the common threads in sustainability that weave our world together and how you have the power to enact direct change by utilizing the skills and resources at your disposal to achieve your greatest impact </strong>(this is called effective altruism). In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement I have for the bio-based future. And then ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you not only build out your knowledge base (a.k.a. expanding your roots), but also to create an actionable path moving forward that will help you build something of value (a.k.a. growing tall).<br/><br/>To be more specific regarding some of the amazing founder stories, novel industries, and new opportunities you'll learn about in this book, we will:</p>
<ol>
<li>Follow the journey of one amazing Gene-trepreneur, Ryan Bethencourt, who took his innovative pet food company Wild Earth to <i>Shark Tank</i> and scored a $550,000 investment from Mark Cuban!</li>
<li>Discover how plant-based, as well as cell-based protein startups (a.k.a. clean meat = real meat without animals) are taking on incumbent factory farming companies and culturing big change for animals, human health, and the planet (it's really like David vs. Goliath)!</li>
<li>And go through the 7 most important entrepreneurial / life lessons I've learned throughout my research, personal experiences, and interactions with top business leaders for turning new knowledge into your direct impact.</li>
</ol>
<strong>You will be enthralled by this book if</strong> you are <u>fascinated by the future</u> (not only wanting to see change but to actively help participate in making science fiction into reality), <u>love genuinely exciting science like the MythBusters love explosions</u>, and <u>have a deep desire to live in a more sustainable and ethical world.</u><br/><br/><i>Gene-trepreneur</i> is a non-fiction book that speaks both to those with technical backgrounds (like STEM students / industry professionals) who are looking to make a shift with their transferable skillsets from highly-replicated lab research into new fields where they can produce more meaningful outcomes (like in cell-based proteins for example), as well as those who may not know much about biotech / sustainability yet but really do care about animals, human health, and the environment. This isn't a textbook, and you don't have to be technical to make a difference in biotech / sustainability – there are a million ways to become a Gene-trepreneur through marketing, branding, finance, graphic design, writing, film-making, art, etc.<br/><br/>I invite you all to <u>join an inclusive and growing community</u> of people who want to make the world a better place, and lucky for you we need all hands on deck because there's simply no time to waste.<br/><br/> <h2>The Book – <i>Gene-trepreneur: How Synthetic Biology &amp; Sustainability Founders are Saving the World + How to Join the Cause to Deliver Your Impact</i>

</ul> <h2>About the Author</h2>Brett Cotten is a young professional on a mission to <u>culture sustainability through biotech and business</u> – primarily via storytelling, technology transfer, and applying the entrepreneurial mindset. He has worked in the Dublin, Ireland startup scene at a telemedicine startup right across from the Guinness Storehouse (great people-watching btw), graduated from The Pennsylvania State University (studied biochemistry, molecular biology, and tech-based entrepreneurship), and will be continuing his education at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom this fall (studying Bioscience Enterprise – the business of biotech).<br/><br/>Retrospectively, his love of animals, the environment, and science was inevitable as he grew up on <i>Bill Nye the Science Guy</i>, <i>The Crocodile Hunter</i>, <i>MythBusters</i>, and perhaps too many ultra-nerdy sci-fi shows. What excites him most now are the current opportunities and future possibilities to use science to help animals (humans included) and the planet. This is why he wrote the book: to inspire others not only to learn about sustainability through the lens of impactful biotech entrepreneurship, but also to motivate + share how everyone can directly help create that very same impact for themselves and those around them!<br/><br/>Although Brett is an avid animal-lover, he recently discovered that saving hibernating spiders from being burned with the firewood (and subsequently placing them safely under the deck to sleep through the rest of winter) is a bad idea when they all wake up and find their way into the house . . . whoops! But he got bit by this funny-looking one and the craziest things started happening – he could suddenly clim... Anyway, if you'd like more information you can connect with Brett via email (brett.a.cotten@gmail.com) and on LinkedIn (<a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/brett-a-cotten"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.linkedin.com/in/brett-a-cotten</a>).<br/><br/> <h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2> The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.<br/><br/>The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.<br/><br/> <h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>

</div></div>","Story of My Book
The world has a lot of problems (definitely more than 99), but luckily, biotechnology offers the most significant opportunities to help solve them. There is hope!And the best way to create the better future you wish to see (and add to that hope) is to be a part of shaping it. This is exactly what Gene-trepreneur is about: expanding your knowledge base and joining a community coming together to tackle some of the world's toughest sustainability problems, deliver incredibly beneficial impacts, and add to the hope!Positive change is sprouting up all around us from rapid technological advancements that are cultivating powerful outcomes in our food system, human health, and species / environmental conservation. Those who take the reigns and become a part of the amazing changes happening now and to come are simultaneously building themselves and the world around them into something we all want to be a part of. I invite you to join the movement and learn along with me how we can deliver the impact we wish to see in the world.My name is Brett Cotten, and I am the author of Gene-trepreneur: How Synthetic Biology & Sustainability Founders are Saving the World + How to Join the Cause to Deliver Your Impact.
I wrote this book to enhance public understanding and scientific literacy in regards to the immense positive effects that synthetic biology and sustainability startups, and the founders behind them, are having on the greatest challenges the world currently faces (factory farming, species extinction, human health, ocean pollution, climate change, etc.). My book displays the interconnectedness between all these issues and shows how everyone can become a Gene-trepreneur amongst the infinite ways there are to become one (and in your own, unique way too).My hope is that through reading this book, you will discover the common threads in sustainability that weave our world together and how you have the power to enact direct change by utilizing the skills and resources at your disposal to achieve your greatest impact (this is called effective altruism). In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement I have for the bio-based future. And then ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you not only build out your knowledge base (a.k.a. expanding your roots), but also to create an actionable path moving forward that will help you build something of value (a.k.a. growing tall).To be more specific regarding some of the amazing founder stories, novel industries, and new opportunities you'll learn about in this book, we will:

Follow the journey of one amazing Gene-trepreneur, Ryan Bethencourt, who took his innovative pet food company Wild Earth to Shark Tank and scored a $550,000 investment from Mark Cuban!
Discover how plant-based, as well as cell-based protein startups (a.k.a. clean meat = real meat without animals) are taking on incumbent factory farming companies and culturing big change for animals, human health, and the planet (it's really like David vs. Goliath)!
And go through the 7 most important entrepreneurial / life lessons I've learned throughout my research, personal experiences, and interactions with top business leaders for turning new knowledge into your direct impact.

You will be enthralled by this book if you are fascinated by the future (not only wanting to see change but to actively help participate in making science fiction into reality), love genuinely exciting science like the MythBusters love explosions, and have a deep desire to live in a more sustainable and ethical world.Gene-trepreneur is a non-fiction book that speaks both to those with technical backgrounds (like STEM students / industry professionals) who are looking to make a shift with their transferable skillsets from highly-replicated lab research into new fields where they can produce more meaningful outcomes (like in cell-based proteins for example), as well as those who may not know much about biotech / sustainability yet but really do care about animals, human health, and the environment. This isn't a textbook, and you don't have to be technical to make a difference in biotech / sustainability – there are a million ways to become a Gene-trepreneur through marketing, branding, finance, graphic design, writing, film-making, art, etc.I invite you all to join an inclusive and growing community of people who want to make the world a better place, and lucky for you we need all hands on deck because there's simply no time to waste. The Book – Gene-trepreneur: How Synthetic Biology & Sustainability Founders are Saving the World + How to Join the Cause to Deliver Your Impact

 About the AuthorBrett Cotten is a young professional on a mission to culture sustainability through biotech and business – primarily via storytelling, technology transfer, and applying the entrepreneurial mindset. He has worked in the Dublin, Ireland startup scene at a telemedicine startup right across from the Guinness Storehouse (great people-watching btw), graduated from The Pennsylvania State University (studied biochemistry, molecular biology, and tech-based entrepreneurship), and will be continuing his education at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom this fall (studying Bioscience Enterprise – the business of biotech).Retrospectively, his love of animals, the environment, and science was inevitable as he grew up on Bill Nye the Science Guy, The Crocodile Hunter, MythBusters, and perhaps too many ultra-nerdy sci-fi shows. What excites him most now are the current opportunities and future possibilities to use science to help animals (humans included) and the planet. This is why he wrote the book: to inspire others not only to learn about sustainability through the lens of impactful biotech entrepreneurship, but also to motivate + share how everyone can directly help create that very same impact for themselves and those around them!Although Brett is an avid animal-lover, he recently discovered that saving hibernating spiders from being burned with the firewood (and subsequently placing them safely under the deck to sleep through the rest of winter) is a bad idea when they all wake up and find their way into the house . . . whoops! But he got bit by this funny-looking one and the craziest things started happening – he could suddenly clim... Anyway, if you'd like more information you can connect with Brett via email (brett.a.cotten@gmail.com) and on LinkedIn (www.linkedin.com/in/brett-a-cotten). Risks & Challenges The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship. Other Ways You Can Help

<p>Hello, I'm Richard, Editor-in-Chief for Plasma Frequency.  Together with my editors we publish a bi-monthly magazine of speculative fiction.  What is speculative fiction? It is a large range of genres including Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Horror.  Besides fiction, we also publish art and book reviews.</p>
<p>In our second year we have two major goals. The first is to continue our success from year one.  The second is to increase our pay rates to our artists and authors.  That is where you come in.</p>
<h3><strong>About Us:</strong></h3>
<p>Plasma Frequency publishes bi-monthly.  Our art has been awarded in reader's polls.  Our stories recognized by readers as being the best they read in 2012.  We are in our second year publishing and have big plans.</p>

<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>The speculative fiction market is divided into several paying categories: Non-paying, Token, Semi-Pro, and Pro.  Currently we pay our authors 1 cent per word, the very bottom of Semi-Pro rates.  We'd like to increase our pay rates to that standard semi-pro rate of 3-4 cents per word.</p>
<p>To do that, we need more money.  Currently almost all of the cost to run this magazine comes from donations (mostly my own). But we are hoping you might be willing to help us increase our pay rates and help us provide a better magazine all around.</p>
<p>Our goal is to raise $7,500 to fund the second year.  Of that money, $1,000 will go into each issue for the purpose of paying authors and artists. The remaining $1,500 goes to yearly operational costs such as Submittable, Web Hosting, printing costs, and other fees.</p>
<p>For your donations we have a variety of gifts.  Those range from being thanked in our magazine on up to copies of our magazine, anthology, and more.  But most importantly you get the satisfaction of contributing to a great magazine that supports the art of writing fiction.</p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>Paying short fiction markets are limited.  The Science Fiction and Fantasy market place has vast amounts of talent that never get published simply because there isn't enough space for every talented author.  In year one we published new authors, established authors, and up-and-comers.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><h2>Depression Sucks!</h2>
<p>That was the original title of this book. And if you have ever struggled with depression or have seen a loved one suffer with it then you know what I talking about. <span style=""background-color: #ffff00;"">It’s unfair and no one deserves to feel this way.</span></p>
<p>From the time I was a teenager to just a few years ago, I suffered through depression. And for 25 years I searched for an effective way to end this vague but unrelenting mental and emotional pain. But year after year I slowly descended into darkness until I woke up one morning and I knew that I just couldn’t make it through another day. It had to end it one way or another. I was tired of my life.</p>
<p>And so I began the hardest work of my life. I had no health insurance, no money, and for reasons I explain in great detail in the program I won’t do medication. However, I did have determination. So I researched, studied and started working my way through my self-sabotage, anger and negative thought patterns.</p>
<h2>What Happened To Me</h2>
<p>I spent four years and $25,000 (money I didn’t have) to figure out what depression is and how to eliminate it. I made massive improvements, made massive mistakes, and hit massive walls, but I kept going, kept trying, because I knew I couldn’t live like this anymore.</p>
<p>And I did it! I ended my depression even though, really, nothing in my outside world had changed. I had changed myself on the inside. I had ended the overwhelm and had ended my emotional pain. I had ended my sorrow and despair. I had changed my life. And if I can do this…then anyone can!</p>
<p>Why do I believe that? You see I didn’t go back to school and get a fancy degree to learn how to end depression. I’m not a psychologist, a neuroscientist or a brain surgeon, and I don’t have a bunch of letters at the end of my name, I am, however, a living, walking, breathing representative of what’s possible. And if I can do this then so can anyone.</p>
<p>You, me and everyone else on this planet are all the same. Our bodies all work the same way, our cells all take in signals and information the same way, our brain cells all wire together and talk to each other the same way. We are the same, so that means if I can do this, then anyone else can too.</p>
<h2>A New Kind of Depression Book</h2>
<p>While there are many books about depression, including some wonderful ones, this one is different. It is a new kind of book because it’s integral and wholistic, as well as, being practical and transformative.</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: #ffff00;"">Depression 180 is a step-by-step, long-term program geared towards massive, lasting life transformation.</span> After years of searching for a way out of my own pain I found I had this amazing toolbox full of scientifically proven methods for eliminating depression, methods and techniques that could save a people a lot of time and keep them from spending a lot of money on things that don’t actually work.</p>
<p>No one deserves to feel depression, anxiety, or be stuck in any other unwanted, unhealthy emotion. This program will guide the reader on how to eliminate depression and create happiness in their life. <span style=""background-color: #ffff00;"">Medical and scientific research proves that depression can be eliminated without medication</span> – something that doctors and the big pharmaceutical companies don’t want you to know.</p>
<h2>Based On The Latest Scientific Research</h2>
<p>In learning to end my own depression <strong>I found the best, scientifically proven methods for eliminating depression and I put them all into one program so that anyone could be guided through it.</strong></p>
<p>I wrote Depression 180 because I wish I had such a complete and thorough guide to eliminating depression when I started out. I’m not a big fan of soaking your brain in pharmaceuticals. I don’t believe you can solve life’s problems with a pill. Solving problems and changing your life will take time, energy, and massive effort. But I’ll let you in on a little secret – it’s so damn worth it!</p>

<p>I’ve spent a year and a half researching and writing the book. <span style=""background-color: #ffff00;"">The 426-page Depression 180 Guidebook is done.</span> I have finished the audio recordings of the book, the cognitive behavior therapy audio exercises, the hypnotherapy sessions, and the pattern interrupt exercises. I also have the graphics done for the front cover of the guidebook. It’s almost there!</p>
<h2>Why I Am Fundraising</h2>
<p>Much to my delight, I have gotten extremely positive reviews from the people who have gone through the program so far, including the CEO of Hampton Road Publishing (home of Richard Bach,<em> Jonathan Livingston Seagull</em>, and Neale Donald Walsch, <em>Conversations with God</em>)…so I can't help but believe I am on the brink of something good and close to helping change some lives.</p>
<p>I just need some financial support to keep up with this positive momentum. I've already invested all of my personal savings (and then some) to get this far… so I decided to give Indiegogo a try. <span style=""background-color: #ffff00;"">The funds raised will help me to afford editing and graphics for the program and to create a massive marketing campaign.</span> Specifically:</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">• Pay for the time and labor to professionally edit and format the book</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">• Hire a graphics person to designed the full book cover, as well as, design the CD case covers and the CDs.  (I’m estimating that there will be 32 CDs in all.)</p>

<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">• The first is a program that will help you increase your child's self esteem</p>

<h3>Help me finish my children's book series (""Maya's Little Friends""), and support a good cause...</h3>
Hi I'm Ranjan, aka Otto Mouton for the purposes of this project -- please view my profile for more about me.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Inspired by my little daughter's growing love of words (she is now five), along with my artistic collaborator Lotta Farber, I have been working on a series of five illustrated children's books that are very loosely based on folk-tales from India. <strong>Three of these five books are already out. Pictures from these three books, which are being offered as Perks for your support, are in the GALLERY section.</strong> These books have received good reviews in several publications, and some of these are included in the Gallery as well. The books have also been enjoyed by many children in schools in and around Nottingham where I've read them, so I hope they'll be a great way of saying ""Thank You"" for your support. <br/><br/>A key goal of mine was also to raise money for a primary school in India that I support (see <a href=""http://www.puvidham.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.puvidham.org</a>), in the sense that 10% of the sale price of every book -- a considerable proportion of the 'profit' -- goes to them (with the rest going toward costs and the publication of further books). Likewise, 10% of the money raised here on Indiegogo will go to Puvidham as well. Since I also wanted to publish works by others if I was successful, I've started a small publishing venture called Robin's Garden Books to bring them out. In this context, I have already started to publish another series of books, written by Nottingham music teacher Sue Lake, called ""Stories from Musicland"" (and the first of her books is out already).<br/><br/>
</div>
<h3>What I need</h3>
<p>I need your help to finish the 'Maya's Little Friends' series. I have published three of the planned five books already (which are entitled 'Snake's Mistake', 'Crow's Woes', and 'Snail's Travails' and are being offered as Perks here, see opposite and below). However, I don't have the resources at present to proceed further and bring out the final two projected books in the series (which are entitled 'Mouse's Grouses' and 'Squirrel's Quarrels'). I am currently working on 'Mouse's Grouses', the fourth book in the series. I hope to bring it out in a few months' time if the money can be raised. And if I can get this fourth book out, I can very likely get a professional distributor for all of these books, which I believe will help me get the final book out in due course as well.</p>
<p>In the first instance, I need to put together $8,000 (£5,000) to get 'Mouse's Grouses' in print. Children's books do cost a lot to bring into print, which is why, having brought out four books already, I am really struggling to bring out book number five. But if I can successfully accomplish that, it would really help things take off. This is the breakdown of the costs involved:</p>
<p>$2,000/ £1200 Illustrator's Fees</p>
<p>$1,000/ £700 Typesetting and preparing camera-ready copy for printer</p>
<p>$5,000/ £3000 Printing costs for a small run (1000 copies) of the book.</p>
<p>I am hoping to raise at least $2,500/ £1,500 towards my needs through this campaign -- I'd love to raise it all, but even this amount would put me well on the road to completing the project. I believe I can offer some really attractive Perks in exchange for your generous support.</p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>The details of what I am offering are listed opposite, but these include:</p>
<ul>
<li>E-books or printed (signed) copies of <strong>the three books in the series that are already out, so you will get something that already exists for your support, regardless of how long it takes for  ""Mouse's Grouses"" to come out<br/></strong>
</li>
<li>Editorial services and writing consultancy for your own project (I am a professional editor with over fifteen years' experience working for many prestigious publishers, and have been an Advanced Member of the Society for Editors and Publishers; see <a href=""http://www.sfep.org.uk/directory/advanced/entry452.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.sfep.org.uk/</a>)</li>
</ul>
<div>Please see opposite for the details, and feel free to obtain more than one Perk!<br/><br/>
</div>
<div>
<h3>How your contribution helps others</h3>
If you support me by choosing one or more books as your Perk, then I will consider this as a 'sale' for practical purposes and 10% of the 'sale price' (which is a large proportion of the profit) will go, as usual, to support Puvidham school in Tamil Nadu, India (<a href=""http://www.puvidham.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.puvidham.org</a>). So 10% of the money raised here after fees have been deducted will go to Puvidham. Furthermore, if your support helps Robin Garden Books to take off, you will have indirectly helped to support Puvidham through further sales.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
You can help by letting others know about this campaign, especially friends with kids in the relevant age ranges who are looking for something fresh that goes beyond the well-worn themes that children's books brought out by the big children's book publishers seem to tread these days.</div>
<div> </div>
<h3>The books being offered as Perks</h3>
<p>A bit about the three books have already been published in the 'Maya's Little Friends' series (again, please visit the GALLERY for sample pages and reviews). These are:</p>
<p>'Snake's Mistake', suitable for ages 6-7;</p>
<p>'Crow's Woes', suitable for ages 5-6;</p>
<p>'Snail's Travails', suitable for children 3-5.</p>
<p>(Please note that ages are offered as rough guides only, and one could easily imagine a child a bit younger -- or older -- enjoying them just as much.)</p>
<p>These books are all written entirely in verse, and feature beautiful, full-page, full-color illustrations by Lotta Farber. They are (<em>very</em> loosely) based on folk tales from India (from the <em>JATAKA </em>and <em>PANCHATANTRA</em> collections). My goal was to contribute towards expanding the genre beyond the well-worn themes we see from large publishers that are available in the market today. <strong>I have uploaded images of the cover page and a sample spread from each of these books for you to check out, and also copies of some reviews etc. in the Gallery. These will tell you all about what's in the books without my having to take up space here. Please click on the GALLERY tab to check these out!</strong></p>
<p>The two books  that will follow ('Mouse's Grouses"" and ""Squirrel's Quarrels"") are aimed at children in the 8-10 age range, and as such are to be written in a combination of prose and verse, and featuring line illustrations that won't necessarily all be full-page or color.</p>
<h3><strong>The forthcoming book (""Mouse's Grouses"")</strong></h3>
<p><strong>""Mouse's Grouses"" </strong>will be the fourth book in the _Maya's Little Friends_ series. It is aimed at 8-10 year-olds, and is a tale of hardship, perseverance in dark places, and eventual triumph -- accompanied by innovative black-and-white drawings. It is told in a mixture of prose and rhyme (including songs), very much inspired by Lewis Carroll, and contains some simple mathematical themes and ideas suitable for children of this age to ponder. With your help, I hope to have it out by the end of this year.</p>
</div></div>","Help me finish my children's book series (""Maya's Little Friends""), and support a good cause...
Hi I'm Ranjan, aka Otto Mouton for the purposes of this project -- please view my profile for more about me.
 
Inspired by my little daughter's growing love of words (she is now five), along with my artistic collaborator Lotta Farber, I have been working on a series of five illustrated children's books that are very loosely based on folk-tales from India. Three of these five books are already out. Pictures from these three books, which are being offered as Perks for your support, are in the GALLERY section. These books have received good reviews in several publications, and some of these are included in the Gallery as well. The books have also been enjoyed by many children in schools in and around Nottingham where I've read them, so I hope they'll be a great way of saying ""Thank You"" for your support. A key goal of mine was also to raise money for a primary school in India that I support (see www.puvidham.org), in the sense that 10% of the sale price of every book -- a considerable proportion of the 'profit' -- goes to them (with the rest going toward costs and the publication of further books). Likewise, 10% of the money raised here on Indiegogo will go to Puvidham as well. Since I also wanted to publish works by others if I was successful, I've started a small publishing venture called Robin's Garden Books to bring them out. In this context, I have already started to publish another series of books, written by Nottingham music teacher Sue Lake, called ""Stories from Musicland"" (and the first of her books is out already).

What I need
I need your help to finish the 'Maya's Little Friends' series. I have published three of the planned five books already (which are entitled 'Snake's Mistake', 'Crow's Woes', and 'Snail's Travails' and are being offered as Perks here, see opposite and below). However, I don't have the resources at present to proceed further and bring out the final two projected books in the series (which are entitled 'Mouse's Grouses' and 'Squirrel's Quarrels'). I am currently working on 'Mouse's Grouses', the fourth book in the series. I hope to bring it out in a few months' time if the money can be raised. And if I can get this fourth book out, I can very likely get a professional distributor for all of these books, which I believe will help me get the final book out in due course as well.
In the first instance, I need to put together $8,000 (£5,000) to get 'Mouse's Grouses' in print. Children's books do cost a lot to bring into print, which is why, having brought out four books already, I am really struggling to bring out book number five. But if I can successfully accomplish that, it would really help things take off. This is the breakdown of the costs involved:
$2,000/ £1200 Illustrator's Fees
$1,000/ £700 Typesetting and preparing camera-ready copy for printer
$5,000/ £3000 Printing costs for a small run (1000 copies) of the book.
I am hoping to raise at least $2,500/ £1,500 towards my needs through this campaign -- I'd love to raise it all, but even this amount would put me well on the road to completing the project. I believe I can offer some really attractive Perks in exchange for your generous support.

<p> </p>
<p> In Dec. of 2010, I started writing a book of Travel Memoirs. The words flowed easily from many experiences travelling around the world with music and etc. But it was the events of Jan. 27th, 2012 that stopped the process of me writing this Memoir and I put the writing on the shelf for the foreseeable future. After I returned to LA from my brother's funeral I sat and stared at all the words of this memoir that I had written and knew that I could no longer resume this writing with the same direction that I had first set out to do. The events, miracles, and emotions of those 2 1/2 weeks that started quite unexpectedly had to be told. I felt that there could be no better way to honor my brother than with this story and it seemed as if he was coercing me to write it. Not for the purpose of dwelling on a tragedy. But to tell an unbelievable story of how events can change in life within hours. And how people whom love one individual can end up in one city that were thousands of miles from each other the day before. This was no longer going to be a book of memoirs. This was no longer going to be a book telling of amazing adventures around the world. This was turning out to be a book that had to tell the unbelievable journey of my experiences in these 2 1/2 weeks and my experience with tragedy throughout my life. Not to dwell on tragedy for the sake of sorrow. But for the sake of hope and for the sake of the fellow grieving individual through any tragedy. Stay will be a book honoring my brother Todd's Life and a book to honor my Father's life. And a book that shares that even through injustice and tragedy. There is an amazing capacity for humankind to forgive, love, and move on, even if the obstacles seem insurmountable. With your help and funding, I will be able to finish writing, publish, and distribute this personal experience of faith, hope, and resilience through immense tragedy and hurt.</p>
<p> Stay will be a book dedicated to those who have lost anyone close to him or her in this life. A book dedicated to anyone who has wandered throughout this life grieving a loss so dear while the world speeds by. I believe that 2012 was a year that many of us grieved those whom we lost that were close to us. And now I firmly believe that 2013 will be the year that we tell their stories. The 2 1/2 weeks that most of this book will focus on surrounding my brother's tragic death forever changed me. I knew that when I returned to the same place after I returned to LA. I firmly believed that this 2 1/2 week tragic journey ,that resulted in a changing hope, had to be told. I hope and pray to inspire, bring hope, reflect, and show that we are all united in this world through the loss of our loved ones. That we as human beings are fragile and have the potential for so many great things through the most trying of times.</p>
<p>The inspiration for the title ""Stay"" came from a song that I began writing after I started the journey home from my brother's funeral. To me it's an honest and emotional song displaying how many of us feel after a loss. We simply wish our loved one could've stayed a little longer. The day after this tragedy happened I also found myself stuck in Phoenix, AZ and I penned a blog detailing the first frantic 24 hours. You can read that blog at this link <a href=""http://wp.me/p1Rnak-5g"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://wp.me/p1Rnak-5g</a> . There you can understand a little bit more of what we went through and I am filling in the rest of the miraculous events that took place in this coming book project. Thank you for helping me tell this story.. Thank you so much for this opportunity.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Why your funding will help?</strong></h2>
<p>This Project will be funded wholly and totally by YOU! Most authors have publishers who help fund, market, and distribute an author's work to the public after the final manuscript is edited and finished. But I have chosen to stay a self published author because of my want to distribute and market this book in the way that I want too. Also since this is a very personal project. A portion of the proceeds from the sales of this book will go to my family and certain expenses incurred from last years funeral costs and etc. </p>
<p>The amount of $15,000.00 is needed for the printing, distribution, marketing, and various costs that a typical publishing company would usually pay for and I, the author, would normally have to reimburse them. Through your contributions, you will make it completely possible for me to finish and disseminate this work as I see fit. I appreciate your help and look forward to sharing the finished product with you and the world. We are shooting for a late summer/fall release of the finished product. And I have already finished a great deal of the writing.. What remains is a lot of editing :) art, more writing, some travelling, and the printing. A lot of work to do yet.. but for now I want to say a big THANK YOU! This will not be possible without you and your contributions.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>How Stay will be read and experienced</strong></h2>
<p><strong><br/></strong>Because everyone can consume reading materials in many different ways in the 21st century. I want to make this book available to everyone in every format, both physical and digital, so it can be bought in any store and read on any device on the market and still consumed by anyone who reads physical books. So here are the formats that we want to make this book available in.</p>
<p>1. Soft Cover Book - Purchased in select bookstores, my website, and Amazon.com</p>
<p>2. Ebook format in every readable digital format</p>
<p>3. Downloadable formats for Nook, ipad, Amazon Kindle, and kobo</p>
<p>4 Ebook will be available on Amazon.com, Barnes and Noble, Apple ibookstore, Sony Reader Store, Kobo, Copia, Baker and Taylor, Gardners Books, eBookPie, eSentral</p>

I received my Bachelor of Fine Art at NSCAD University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and now live and work in Ottawa. Part of the reason I have returned to my hometown is that my mother passed away shortly after I graduated. I had things going on in Halifax, but felt that it was time to leave and spend some time regrouping at home. </p>
<p><b>The Book: </b>Shortly after my Mom died someone told me I shouldn't make any big decisions until six months had passed. It seemed like good advice, so I stuck around and got a job and a studio in Ottawa and spent time with my grief. In that six-month period I did a lot of drawing and writing, which I have compiled into this book. It is not a telling of my experience of grief per se, but moreso a glimpse into my mental state while grieving in that period immediately after her death. The drawings range from fiction to non-fiction comics as well as illustration, and the writing is all based on lived experiences. </p>
<p>This project is fully self-directed and self-published. It being my first time, there have been some hurdles to overcome, but I have already printed the first edition. However, I am unable to fund printing anymore copies, but would like to have enough stock to distribute to bookstores. The way that the printing works is the more copies I order, the cheaper it is per book, so I'm aiming to raise as much as I can. Common practice in book stores is they don't pay you up front for the book, but when it sells, so I need to have enough books to provide book stores with stock as well as fulfill individual orders. </p> </div> <div> <h3>The DEAL$</h3>
<p>If I can raise a minimum of $300, I can print 25 books, just enough to fulfill individual orders and have a few extra to stock bookstores. If I can raise $420, I can print 50 books, which will be enough to have a small back stock for both individual orders and book stores. My ~*Big Goal*~ is to raise $1,000 to print as many books as I can (about 120) which would set me up to establish a self-sustaining cycle of printing and selling books!</p>
<p>Here's what you get for donating:</p>
<p>1) Donate $5 and get a little original drawing mailed to you!</p>
<p>2) Donate $15 and get an 8 1/2"" X 11"" print of a drawing from the book! </p>
<p>3) Donate $20 and get a copy of the book!</p>
<p>4) Donate $25 and  get a copy of the book with a personalized note to ANYONE, could be you or someone else, signed by the artist!</p>
<p>5) Donate $50 and get a unique handmade mug, also made by me in the six-month period following my mother's passing. </p>
<p>6) Donate $75 and get a mug AND a signed book with a personalized note!</p>
<p>(see the Gallery tab ^^^ for pictures)</p>
<p>SO: even if I don't reach my goal, I'll still print as many books as I can with the funds that I raise AND you'll still get your perks for contributing!</p>

</div><div>
<p>This is my first book and I'm very excited to share it with the world! I've already printed the first edition and sold out of copies very quickly and have been getting all kinds of great feedback so far. Numerous people have approached me after reading the book with their own grieving stories to tell, and one of the unifying points they all have is that grief seems to be something that as a culture we brush under the rug. For me making this book seemed natural, and though it may be nerve-racking at times putting myself out there with material that I made in a period where I felt very raw, I think it is good for people to come together in those times. My hope is that the book will not only be an enjoyable read, but also encourage others to feel more comfortable with their grief, and by extension other life-changing experiences, and feel empowered to share their own stories. </p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As an artist I tend to tackle large projects, and usually have two or three on the go at once. During university I was granted access to the facilities to really accommodate this working process and produced multiple large projects. Now that I am graduated and working on repaying student loans and making a living while maintaining an artistic practice I have returned to the basics, if you will, and have been spending more time drawing in my sketchbook and working on more affordable projects. This has not stunted my productivity, merely provided a challenge which I readily accept. <br/></p>
<p>I have been approaching book stores in the Ottawa area, as well as Montreal, and they so far have been receptive to selling the books, if only I had any to sell! It all comes down to one simple problem: stock stock stock. I need a hefty stock of books to be able to get this thing off the ground and into stores! The material is all there, the printers are ready and familiar with the project, now I just need the funds to print a lot of books.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>I get it if you can't afford to help out. Hey neither can I, that's why I'm here! But sharing this campaign is a great help in itself. Thanks for reading and please share!</p>

For me making this book seemed natural, and though it may be nerve-racking at times putting myself out there with material that I made in a period where I felt very raw, I think it is good for people to come together in those times. My hope is that the book will not only be an enjoyable read, but also encourage others to feel more comfortable with their grief, and by extension other life-changing experiences, and feel empowered to share their own stories.    Risks & Challenges
As an artist I tend to tackle large projects, and usually have two or three on the go at once. During university I was granted access to the facilities to really accommodate this working process and produced multiple large projects. Now that I am graduated and working on repaying student loans and making a living while maintaining an artistic practice I have returned to the basics, if you will, and have been spending more time drawing in my sketchbook and working on more affordable projects. This has not stunted my productivity, merely provided a challenge which I readily accept. 
I have been approaching book stores in the Ottawa area, as well as Montreal, and they so far have been receptive to selling the books, if only I had any to sell! It all comes down to one simple problem: stock stock stock. I need a hefty stock of books to be able to get this thing off the ground and into stores! The material is all there, the printers are ready and familiar with the project, now I just need the funds to print a lot of books.   Other Ways You Can Help I get it if you can't afford to help out. Hey neither can I, that's why I'm here! But sharing this campaign is a great help in itself. Thanks for reading and please share!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

The book explores the simple math of the planet we face. I explore a wide range of exciting solutions and the principles of action we need to employ to make the progress we must.</p></div><div>
<p><u>Climate change is a defining issue of our time</u>. Nearly every day we see the impact of our warming climate - record wildfires, rising seas, intense floods and heatwaves. To avoid the worst consequences of man-made climate change, we need to reduce our CO2 emissions by 50 billion tons per year and further remove 200-300 billion tons of CO2 already in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>My name is James Earl Anderson and I am the author of <i>Just Good Enough for the Climate - the math of the planet and the color of carbon</i>. I wrote this book because I was inspired by the stories of entrepreneurs, scientists and policy makers working at the forefront of the climate crisis. I wanted to tell their stories and add my voice by providing a practical business oriented view on climate change that could inspire action.</p>
<p>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the importance of taking action on the climate crisis, how many ways people are already making a difference, and how much more can be done. With this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for the environment, climate change mitigation efforts, business solutions, and the principles of action and innovation that can lead us forward. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you make sense of climate change - the challenges and potential solutions. I hope it will inspire action by all of us to do more.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn that the over arching math of the climate is not that complicated. I review a number of the innovations that can help us combat climate change, as well as the importance of ecosystem benefits, and how we can enhance them by changing our view of nature. You'll hear stories such as...</p>
<ul>
<li>How the IPCC's dogged pursuit of the science is turning the tide.</li>
<li>How venture funded start ups are launching and scaling solutions to meet the climate challenge</li>
<li>How a diverse array of financial instruments are being used to fund and support climate change mitigation efforts</li>
<li>The amazing importance of ecosystem services and how rethinking our relationship with nature can enhance these essential benefits</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you want to learn more about climate change, the stories of people innovating new solutions to the climate challenge and the principles of action that can get us there.<br/><br/><u><i>Just Good Enough for the Climate</i></u> is a nonfiction book that speaks to the general public, business people and investors who want to look at climate change, our connection with the environment, and the principles of innovation in a new way.</p>
<p>The book is written in three parts.<br/><br/>Part 1 <strong>“We’re F**ked” Get Over It</strong>, contains the introduction + chapters 1-4, and provides an overview of the climate change challenge. It outlines the carbon cycle and the math of the planet in simple terms. It shows how a complex array of changes, not a simple one size fits all solution, can help us make progress.  It shows how we can overcome the climate challenge if we take action.<br/><br/>Part 2 <strong>Principles that Get Us There</strong>, contains chapters 5-8, and describes the principles of action that are essential to making progress. It provides an overview of how innovations are stacked on top of each other and not confined to technology, but can be applied everywhere. It also talks about climate finance and how a whole system of funding mechanisms needs to be more engaged to provide the resources necessary to overcome climate change.<br/><br/>Part 3 <strong>Existence Theorems</strong>, contains chapters 9-14, and talks about all the colors of carbon and vast array of solutions that are available to make real progress. We can improve how we manage our forests and farms. We can preserve the oceans. We can change our built world, how we generate energy and the circular economy to make rapid progress.<br/> </p>

He finally decides that it isn't so bad being a boy, because he is a part of God's Kingdom, created in His image, with many capabilities and freedom sweet freedom to be whatever chooses.</p><p><i>My Favorite Color is Blue</i> is about Asha who loves school and the color blue. Learning for this little girl is a fantasy awash in her favorite hue. She uses the color blue to explore the importance of book knowledge, the obstacles we had to overcome to gain it, and the wonder and wisdom of the Good Book, God provides as a guide for life. Asha excels in school and her future is bright as the blue sky.</p><p><i>Fight the Air Guy</i> is a book about Jelani who fights for the attention that he feels he does not get at home. We watch as his alter ego takes on the air and is triumphant in every battle. He wants nothing more than to find his place in the family and in the world. Through his inner turmoil he realizes that he is more than capable of excelling in various arenas, and there are people all around him that celebrate his individuality.

She has her mind set on teaching her siblings how to balance fighting and having fun with each other by example and through song (she is still working on the song part).

People; I need people. When I explained to my son Khalil what oxymoron meant at around the age of eight, he responded, ""Oh, you mean like rich mom."" The money will be used to pay for the illustrations and self publishing costs of all four books. The illustrations will come to around $6000 and publishing will come close to $8000. So, in order to complete all four books, it will come to $14,000 altogether. I have began personally investing in the project and applying for Grants, as well.About ThatI know everyone cannot contribute financially, but I would like to share my sincere gratitude for you viewing my campaign.

Why are we doing this? Because we’ve had enough!
On January 24th, 2011, a Toronto police officer gave some advice that is all too common: “Women should avoid dressing like sluts in order not to be victimized.” From an 11-year-old in Texas being blamed for being gang-raped to a teenager in Seattle not being able to file rape charges because witnesses “portrayed the act as consensual,” this line of thought pervades our culture. As long as it seems like the woman might like sex, they’re made to take the blame.
The idea that women invite sexual violence by looking like they enjoy sex, or that men’s urges become so uncontrollable at the sight of a little extra skin that they can’t hold themselves back from raping, is ludicrous. People aren’t assaulted because they invited it or enticed others to it by looking a certain way; they’re assaulted because somebody chose to assault them. Saying that survivors could have protected themselves by not looking like “sluts” implies that the survivors are at fault and creates a culture in which the heinous crime of sexual assault is seen as no big deal.
Whatever reason a person is called a “slut,” the word is always meant to hurt them. In addition, the use of the word “slut” to bring people—primarily women—down for their sexuality feeds into a culture that accepts rape. When people are brought down for their sexual choices, it dehumanizes them and allows others to see them as not as worthy of protection from violence. As long as people are judged for how few or how many sex partners they have, how rarely or how often they have sex, or whatever other choices they make for their own sex lives, we cannot eradicate the myth that survivors of sexual assault were “asking for it.”
We’re sick of slut-shaming and victim-blaming being a part of our culture, so we’re doing something about it: we’re going to make our voices heard. This June we will walk in Seattle to stand together, fight the social acceptance of rape in our culture, and re-appropriate the word “slut” as one that cannot be used to harm.

We are collaborating with the Southwest Gay &amp; Lesbian Film Festival to bring the first transgender film festival to the entire southwest region on April 5, 2014 - with amazing support through our Indiegogo campaign, where we reached our $1000 goal. And now, we want to work with local talented poets to come in and help our community members with  their poetry. These workshops will take place once per month and will culminate in the publication of a real anthology book. </p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>We need a total of $2000 for one year of this program. We will use the funds to provide a small stipend to the visiting poets and to purchase special food for the workshops.

We provide transgender ""cultural humility"" training all over the state of New Mexico, do advocacy at the individual and policy level, and operate a drop-in center where we offer tons of services to our community. You can check us out at www.tgrcnm.org or on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/TGRCNM. In addition to helping folks with basic survival needs, we are also committed to programs that nurture the dreams and talents of our community members. We are collaborating with the Southwest Gay & Lesbian Film Festival to bring the first transgender film festival to the entire southwest region on April 5, 2014 - with amazing support through our Indiegogo campaign, where we reached our $1000 goal. And now, we want to work with local talented poets to come in and help our community members with  their poetry. These workshops will take place once per month and will culminate in the publication of a real anthology book. What We Need & What You GetWe need a total of $2000 for one year of this program. We will use the funds to provide a small stipend to the visiting poets and to purchase special food for the workshops. We are managing to do a program like this on a real shoestring, so you can rest assured that your donation will go straight to the program. We would love to shout out to you on our Facebook page for your support. At the $25 level, we will get you your own copy of the book we publish at the end of the year. The ImpactIf you aren't familiar with the challenges that transgender folks face in our world right now, they are quite severe.

</p></div>","Through my work with Live Different, I have seen lives altered on many levels. I have helped to give wings to programs that have helped to give hundreds of families safe and healthy homes, restored broken dreams and changed perspectives globally. I have also known what it is to struggle and wonder if you can ever make a difference that will last.And the answer is Yes! We Can!Hi, I'm Christal Earle. As the co-founder of an international youth empowerment and humanitarian charity, I have been an integral part of making change in lives across Canada and globally since 2000. I have invested my energy, passion and vision into making the world a safer and freer place for those who have experienced pain and exploitation because I believe that we each have the power to make a difference in our world.That change has to start with who we are and what we believe about ourselves.I have dedicated my life to helping to make a path for the next generation. I have personally mentored and coached hundreds of young leaders and humanitarians and I am now intent on doing that in a new capacity: coaching and creating community for entrepreneurs and social change makers around the globe.My sights are now set on using my speaking and writing gifts to reach a larger audience with a unique and personal call to action: The call to first change the story we are telling ourselves about who we are and what we are capable of accomplishing. Resonate is not just about my story -- it's about the stories we all find ourselves living out on every level.I have created tangible ways in my book that can help us to change the world, starting with how we view ourselves and our individual power of choice. We all need someone to believe in us, and sometimes the first person we need to convince is ourselves!And that's why I'm asking you to help make this message bigger, louder and more accessible to those who need it most!Resonate: The Stories We Tell Ourselves is a book, a workbook, a coaching/mentoring program and a movement for change. It's a message that is alive inside of me and I believe it's a message that can help heal and restore millions of lives. I have been changed by hope and I invite you to help me and my team make that change real for thousands of lives around the globe.We truly need your help to launch Resonate in the fall of 2014!By contributing to the Resonate campaign, you will be a part of three very significant steps towards continuing to heal our world.ONE - By helping our team publish the book and release the programs around it, I truly believe that the message contained in the book can help to create change and hope in your own life.TWO- You can help us to get the message out to more lives to uncover the power of their story to heal and change the world through purchasing a perk that comes with extra copies of the book.Three - You will help us to make the world a safer and freer world for women and children, as 10% of book sales are going directly to help victims of trafficking and exploitation with an organization that Christal and Live Different have supported and volunteered with since 2006.By being a part of our campaign, you are literally going to help to RESONATE  hope and change around the world! We can't do it alone - and we want to create change together with you.Over the next 32 days we are seeking to raise $17,500 in our campaign. Here is what we plan to do with that money:$3500    Professional Editing by Milner and Associates$2500    Publishing and Access to retail distribution to over 25,000 global book retailers via Friesens Press and Ingram Book Company $4000    Book Release event management (includes social media, advertising and book release program for 5 months until our official book launch in the fall)$2800    Support of pre-launch perks and ""Resonate"" products via Indiegogo $1700     Video, photography and editing for campaign launch$1500    Website Design and Development$1500   Projected Donation to Buddies Along the Road from Pre-sales B (if we reach our full funding goal of $17,500)*If we exceed our goal, we will use additional funds to amp up our online campaign for the book launch, as well as continue to put 10% of pre-sales towards Buddies Along The Road in Thailand.The Resonate Campaign is centred around the pre-sale of books to help cover the costs of professional editing, publishing and distribution. However, as you can see from the list of perks, I am also calling for us to work together to help create change through getting more copies of the book into the hands of those who need it most and through the power that can come through personal coaching and mentoring.AND BECAUSE OF MY COMMITMENT TO CONTINUING TO BE A PART OF HOPE AND CHANGE ON A GLOBAL LEVEL...In the future 10% of all total print book sales are going directly to projects that our team supports globally that are focused on fighting exploitation and slavery.The organization that we will be supporting through our portion is called Buddies Along the Road, a children's home that I have personally worked with through Live Different since 2006.  Buddies Along the Road focuses on rescuing and rehabilitating children from Thailand and Myanmar who have been victimized by sexual exploitation and slavery. They are helping to create a future of hope for them through the security that comes from belonging and solidarity -- and I am honoured to be able to play a part in helping to create that future.It's possible for our generation to help end exploitation and shame, but we have to be willing to recognize the power of our life to make that difference. Resonate is a call to recognize the power of our lives and this financial commitment through book sales is me putting actions to my words.It's possible that you may not be able to contribute to the campaign right now, and I understand. But that doesn't mean you can't be a powerful part of making it bigger and better! Please make some noise with us and share the campaign through the tools below. Many voices can make big waves of change as they resonate together.We can change the stories that we all tell ourselves. For a better future.

Be prepared to experience a powerful connection with a world class humanitarian and at the same time receive exceptional clarity on what is needed to create a vibrant, passionate and fulfilling life.  I recommend taking this emotional, insightful journey towards self-discovery.""  William J. Nippard, Author of The Teamwork Ladder: 8 Steps to MAXIMUM Success""Christal has a way with words that simply pulls you in - and doesn't let you go. Her stories are for you, me, every woman who has ever experienced fear, uncertainly, loss... but also joy, connection, purpose. This book has the power to change lives; it needs to get out into the world."" Carol Schulte, www.carolschulte.com""An emotionally charged book that is honest and raw.  It delivers painful truths with a lot of passion and a little bit of humour.  In this life we write our own stories and create our own histories.  But with this book we are given a chance to craft a future with a better version of ourselves. A stronger more confident self."" Angela Cacciavillani""Resonate:  The Stories We Tell Ourselves is at once contemplative, riveting and practical.  Christal brings you along on her journey with an honesty and authenticity not often shared.  She selflessly hands you the tools she fought so hard for, so that you can apply them to your own life story.  If you endeavour to live a life that you script, rather than being the victim of life's circumstances, then this book has to be on your ""must read"" list."" Cheryl Boyce, Chief Freedomizer at Freedom Culture""Christal is a master storyteller so it seems quite fitting that she is writing on the subject of the power of the stories we tell ourselves.  Though it is clear that she writes very purposefully and withcarefully crafted language, Christal also writes with a warmth and her own personal style that makes you feel like you're sitting down for coffee with a good friend.  The kind of friend who isn't afraid to open right up to you and let you see her for who she really is. Walk away with new insights on how to discover the lies you have been believing and how to plant new seeds of truth in your mind. Be empowered to tell the stories you want your life to tell and be reminded of the connections between our own stories and those of people around the world.""

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>My name is Florentin Bosse, a ""professional nomad"", born in Bucharest, with German ancestors and a Portuguese heart, who lived and worked in New York, Chicago, London, Paris, Frankfurt, München, Berlin and Lisbon.  </p>
<p>I had
the idea of creating this place of harmony, wisdom and emotional well- being
during my five month self-imposed exile from society – when I undertook a
solitary pilgrimage of over 3.800 km, from Berlin to Santiago de Compostella in Spain and further to Fatima in Portugal. I came back from my journey with this strong feeling
that there is a painful search all the way through our communities for
regaining authenticity, authenticity of our values and our purpose. My intention with creating Letters Matters is to give people back the joy of
reading, to give them back the ability to dream with open eyes. As Oscar Wilde
said, ""it is
what you read when you don't have to, that determines what you will be when you
can't help it.”<br/></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">It is my deepest hope that reading will not be a skill or a function that will lose its meaning and get
atrophied like an appendix in the next centuries; it is Letters Matters' mission, philosophy, and credo that our duty is to ensure this will not happen.  </span></p>

<p>The Baltimore Institute For Nonprofit Journalism returns for another fundraiser and once again we are in emergency mode.</p>
<p>As you may have read already, the Baltimore Beat is no more. After just four months, the owners of the Beat have decided to shut it down. The story is one you have heard plenty of times before: a lack of ad revenue. Baynard Woods and Brandon Soderberg founded BINJ with Marc Steiner after the Baltimore City Paper was closed for the same “lack of revenue” reason precisely because it was clear that the for-profit model could not be the sole model for local journalism.</p>
<p>Soderberg and Woods helped get the Beat off the ground and helped edit the paper working with Lisa Snowden-McCray and Maura Callahan, and so, along with this being a blow to  local journalism and the city, it’s a blow to BINJ. We are devastated. And there is less local journalism at a time where the city needs more eyes on those in power than ever.</p>
<p>We are however, used to operating in crisis mode. So we're asking for some money from you to keep funding journalism. With the money raised during BINJ's initial fundraiser, we created an issue of City Paper put together by Writers in Baltimore Schools, helped fund the third issue of Lawrence Burney's “True Laurels,” and fully funded the first issue of Reginald Thomas II's “The City That Hoops,” all the while developing the Beat. You can read about our progress so far <a href=""https://medium.com/@BINJ.Baltimore/the-baltimore-institute-for-nonprofit-journalism-six-months-in-b6c49af6d898"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</p>
<p>We also have a few pending projects related to Mondawmin Mall's history and a look at Baltimore gangs on the way and some information sessions planned. Due to the Beat coming about, we put the first BINJ money into long-term projects assuming the Beat could fund day-to-day journalism. BINJ will continue to fund these kinds of big projects—especially the second issue of “The City That Hoops”—but this second fundraiser will mostly begin to help fund ongoing news coverage.</p>
<p>Your donations will fund reporting that you will see quickly and will be part of ongoing investigative and/or on-the-ground reportage.The collaboration between the Beat and Real News to cover the Gun Trace Task Force and other coverage which contrasts and complements more conventional daily news is necessary and we want to keep getting this journalism out there and providing it to the outlets that are still around</p>
<p>We need your help to do that.</p>

<p><strong>About BINJ:</strong></p>
<p><i>The Baltimore Institute for Nonprofit Journalism (BINJ) is a guerrilla newsroom raiding the ruins of corporate media and fixing Baltimore’s media desert.</i></p>
<p><i>BINJ was founded by Baynard Woods, Brandon Soderberg, and Marc Steiner in response to the dearth of progressive media in Baltimore following the end of The Marc Steiner Show on WEAA and the imminent closure of the Baltimore City Paper.

<h3>The Campaign</h3>
<p>My name is <a href=""http://www.meganbosticbooks.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Megan Bostic,</a> I'm a young adult author. My first novel Never Eighteen was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt in January of 2012. Contrary to what you may think, just because you're published doesn't mean you're making a ton of money, and doesn't automatically guarantee you'll be published again.</p>
<p>After parting ways with my agent and looking for another with no success, and then trying to land another book deal, also with no luck, I've decided to go Indie. I could continue my pursuits to be published traditionally, but at this point if I found an agent and a publisher, more than likely I'd be looking at a 2015 publication date.</p>
<p>I'm passionate about writing contemporary teen fiction. I like to remind today's teens that no matter their problems, they are never alone, there is help out there, and there is always a light at the end of the tunnel.</p>
<p>When my last book was published, I received emails quite often from teens who connected strongly with my characters and their problems. With your contributions I'll be able to reach teens with my words in a matter of months, rather than waiting a couple of years.</p>
<h3>Dissected, the Novel</h3>
<p>Here is a summary of the novel you will be helping get off the ground:</p>
<p><span class=""userContent"">Sydney Warner, a teenage girl, whom after being abandoned by her mother at a young age, becomes a thrill seeker with a penchant for extreme sports and a fascination with death.

Betrayal, loneliness, and a mishap with a picture frame set Syd on a course of self-destruction that includes alcohol, drugs, and self-mutilation in the form of cutting.<br/><br/> After nearly bleeding to death during an arm carving mishap, Syd is tossed unwillingly into a teen psyche ward where she comes to realize she’s not alone. Through new friendships, unwelcomed therapy, and her love of the stars, she finds alternate ways to cope with her emotions on her path to forgiveness and redemption.</span></span></p>

<h3>Where Your Contributions Will Go</h3>
<p>Whether getting published traditionally or indie, a mid-list author has to invest a ton of time, money, and resources to get their book off the ground. Here's where your contributions will go:</p>
ISBN numbers. These are numbers that identify your book. If you're going to put your book online and audio, you need more than one and they are sold in blocks of ten.</div>
<div>~Distribution costs. In order to get into your local bookstores, my book will need to be carried with major distributors, which costs money.</div>
<div>~Editing. To get the best product possible on the shelves, I'd like to buy editing software and pay for a professional editor to assist me.</div>
<div>~Marketing. This is where most of the money goes. Getting your book noticed is no easy task. Book marketing takes ads, bookmarks, postcards, press kits, books for reviews and giveaways, and shipping costs. Also, since I write for teens, I also buy SWAG - Stuff We All Get, buttons, stickers, and bracelets. They love these little extras and it helps engage them during school and library visits.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Speaking of visits...</div>
<div> </div>
<div>~Your money will also help with travel costs to bookstore, library and school events. These events are one of my favorite things about being an author. I love to talk to readers and aspiring writers.</div>

<h3>If you can't donate</h3>
<p>You could help by spreading the word to those you think might be interested and watch for my novel to hit shelves later this year. I'm shooting for summer.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for considering my campaign. It's much appreciated.</p>

<h3>About</h3>
<p><em>The Riveter</em> is a magazine that celebrates narratives and longform journalism by women. We are dedicated to exposing the power of women’s experiences and women as storytellers, because, as two female twentysomething journalism students, we noticed a void in the representation of female longform journalists. This is our effort to fill it. We don’t believe in stories that can be summed up in a sell line.</p>
<p>We publish original stories by women about any subject, located in any place, seen from the female perspective. We also profile these women writers who are not getting appropriate mainstream recognition. We foster a space for these powerful discourses to mingle.</p>
<p>This is riveting content.</p>

<h2>Notre histoire<img alt=""La vie est belle! Juin 2013"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.mlveb.com/upload/1306_juin_couverture.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin: 6px; float: right;"" title=""Dossier: Paternité(s)""/>
</h2>
<p>En 1975, à la suite de la vive interpellation de Paul VI aux chrétiens, les exhortant à s'impliquer dans les médias, Paul Bouchard a lancé un tabloïd qui s’appelait alors <em>Esprit Vivant</em>. Sans argent, sans formation particulière, sans outils adéquats, il s’est complètement livré à ce projet, convaincu de répondre à un appel : “Témoigner de l'Évangile de Jésus-Christ et servir son règne social de paix et de justice sur la terre par les moyens de communication sociale” (extrait des lettres patentes).</p>
<p>En 2010, 35 ans plus tard, il passait le flambeau à sa fille, Sophie Bouchard. Mue par le désir de faire des pas de plus pour accomplir cette mission et appuyée sur les demandes répétées de Jean-Paul II et de Benoît XVI, la nouvelle équipe rajeunie, passionnée et débordante d’idées donnait naissance, en février 2012, à une publication complètement métamorphosée: Le magazine <em><strong>La vie est belle!</strong></em> <em>(Si vous ne connaissez pas le magazine La vie est belle!, c'est avec plaisir que nous vous enverrons un exemplaire PDF gratuitement sur demande à <a href=""mailto:info@mlveb.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">info@mlveb.com</a>.)</em></p>
<p>Ce nouveau magazine se voulait loin des controverses et désirait plutôt interpeller par la beauté. Il fallait désormais tendre la main à ceux qui sont isolés, nourrir la vie spirituelle des assoiffés, offrir un moment de détente à ceux qui sont stressés, raconter les passages de Dieu à ceux qui manquent d'espérance, marcher avec ceux qui ont besoin d'être accompagnés, déjouer ceux qui soulèvent des doutes et annoncer l'amour à ceux qui crèvent de solitude. Tout cela, l’équipe de La vie est belle! le réalise tant pour celui qui est en recherche de sens que pour le chrétien convaincu. C’est la nouvelle évangélisation.</p>
<p>Mais comment rejoindre concrètement tous ces gens qui attendent une parole d’espérance? Eh bien! là même où ils cherchent le bonheur, bien sûr, c'est-à-dire dans les magasins, et plus précisément, dans les kiosques à journaux.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong><img alt=""Notre dossier sur la beauté"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.laboutikenligne.com/upload/products/1304laveb_couverture.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin: 6px; float: left;"" title=""Avril 2013""/>Nos besoins </strong></h2>
<p>Nous sommes des passionnés qui veulent transmettre ce qu’ils ont reçu. Nous avons le zèle, mais nous sommes continuellement aux prises avec un obstacle de taille : les ressources financières. Notre équipe est dirigée par des laïcs et est formée principalement de laïcs. Nous ne sommes liés à aucune communauté religieuse, à aucun diocèse ou sanctuaire, ni à aucune association. Mais l'inconvénient de cette indépendance, c’est que nous ne sommes pas non plus soutenus financièrement de façon récurrente et officielle.</p>
<p>Nous avons besoin d’argent pour rester sur la place publique. La distribution en kiosque est coûteuse et ne nous rapporte pas d’argent. Au contraire, nos pertes annuelles brutes s’élèvent à 5768$ pour la première année de distribution, soit une perte mensuelle de 576$. Un bon comptable dirait qu’il faut cesser la distribution pour atteindre un équilibre budgétaire. Mais alors, notre mission s’en trouverait affectée. Il faut donc aller à l’encontre de la logique comptable et plutôt compter sur la Providence.</p>
<p>Voilà la raison d’être de cette campagne de financement : maintenir la distribution en kiosque. Et si votre générosité est suffisante, diminuer le prix du magazine pour le rendre accessible à plus de gens. Ceux qui soutiennent le magazine <strong><em>La vie est belle!</em> </strong>participent à cette mission et répondent, par le fait même, à l’appel du Christ : “Allez dans le monde entier et proclamez la bonne nouvelle.”</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Ce que vous obtenez </strong></h2>
<p>Rien de ce que nous pourrons vous donner en contrepartie ne pourra rendre justice à la valeur de vos dons. Mais c’est avec joie que nous tenons à vous exprimer notre gratitude dès ici-bas, au nom de Dieu.</p>
<h3>Le reçu de charité</h3>
<p>Nous pouvons émettre des reçus de charité aux canadiens qui nous font parvenir un don de 25$ et plus.</p>

<p>Les réactions à la suite de la métamorphose complète de notre magazine en 2012 ont dépassé nos attentes. Vingt-trois pour cent (23%) de nos abonnés actuels sont de nouveaux clients. Selon notre sondage maison réalisé en mars 2013, notre lectorat a rajeuni de 6%. Ces résultats sont en partie attribuables à la distribution en kiosque.

Notre histoire

En 1975, à la suite de la vive interpellation de Paul VI aux chrétiens, les exhortant à s'impliquer dans les médias, Paul Bouchard a lancé un tabloïd qui s’appelait alors Esprit Vivant. Sans argent, sans formation particulière, sans outils adéquats, il s’est complètement livré à ce projet, convaincu de répondre à un appel : “Témoigner de l'Évangile de Jésus-Christ et servir son règne social de paix et de justice sur la terre par les moyens de communication sociale” (extrait des lettres patentes).
En 2010, 35 ans plus tard, il passait le flambeau à sa fille, Sophie Bouchard. Mue par le désir de faire des pas de plus pour accomplir cette mission et appuyée sur les demandes répétées de Jean-Paul II et de Benoît XVI, la nouvelle équipe rajeunie, passionnée et débordante d’idées donnait naissance, en février 2012, à une publication complètement métamorphosée: Le magazine La vie est belle! (Si vous ne connaissez pas le magazine La vie est belle!, c'est avec plaisir que nous vous enverrons un exemplaire PDF gratuitement sur demande à info@mlveb.com.)
Ce nouveau magazine se voulait loin des controverses et désirait plutôt interpeller par la beauté. Il fallait désormais tendre la main à ceux qui sont isolés, nourrir la vie spirituelle des assoiffés, offrir un moment de détente à ceux qui sont stressés, raconter les passages de Dieu à ceux qui manquent d'espérance, marcher avec ceux qui ont besoin d'être accompagnés, déjouer ceux qui soulèvent des doutes et annoncer l'amour à ceux qui crèvent de solitude. Tout cela, l’équipe de La vie est belle! le réalise tant pour celui qui est en recherche de sens que pour le chrétien convaincu. C’est la nouvelle évangélisation.
Mais comment rejoindre concrètement tous ces gens qui attendent une parole d’espérance? Eh bien! là même où ils cherchent le bonheur, bien sûr, c'est-à-dire dans les magasins, et plus précisément, dans les kiosques à journaux.
 
Nos besoins 
Nous sommes des passionnés qui veulent transmettre ce qu’ils ont reçu. Nous avons le zèle, mais nous sommes continuellement aux prises avec un obstacle de taille : les ressources financières. Notre équipe est dirigée par des laïcs et est formée principalement de laïcs. Nous ne sommes liés à aucune communauté religieuse, à aucun diocèse ou sanctuaire, ni à aucune association. Mais l'inconvénient de cette indépendance, c’est que nous ne sommes pas non plus soutenus financièrement de façon récurrente et officielle.
Nous avons besoin d’argent pour rester sur la place publique. La distribution en kiosque est coûteuse et ne nous rapporte pas d’argent. Au contraire, nos pertes annuelles brutes s’élèvent à 5768$ pour la première année de distribution, soit une perte mensuelle de 576$. Un bon comptable dirait qu’il faut cesser la distribution pour atteindre un équilibre budgétaire. Mais alors, notre mission s’en trouverait affectée. Il faut donc aller à l’encontre de la logique comptable et plutôt compter sur la Providence.
Voilà la raison d’être de cette campagne de financement : maintenir la distribution en kiosque. Et si votre générosité est suffisante, diminuer le prix du magazine pour le rendre accessible à plus de gens. Ceux qui soutiennent le magazine La vie est belle! participent à cette mission et répondent, par le fait même, à l’appel du Christ : “Allez dans le monde entier et proclamez la bonne nouvelle.”
 
Ce que vous obtenez 
Rien de ce que nous pourrons vous donner en contrepartie ne pourra rendre justice à la valeur de vos dons. Mais c’est avec joie que nous tenons à vous exprimer notre gratitude dès ici-bas, au nom de Dieu.
Le reçu de charité
Nous pouvons émettre des reçus de charité aux canadiens qui nous font parvenir un don de 25$ et plus.

L'impact espéré
Les réactions à la suite de la métamorphose complète de notre magazine en 2012 ont dépassé nos attentes. Vingt-trois pour cent (23%) de nos abonnés actuels sont de nouveaux clients. Selon notre sondage maison réalisé en mars 2013, notre lectorat a rajeuni de 6%. Ces résultats sont en partie attribuables à la distribution en kiosque. Mais il y a encore beaucoup de travail à faire. Il faudrait même installer des présentoirs pour attirer davant age l’attention.
La vie est belle! Mais tout le monde ne le sait pas encore. Nous croyons que notre magazine contribue à transmettre ce goût de la vie et de la beauté au monde.

<p>     Too many student &amp; mentor poets today are missing each other. We have this thing called the internet to connect them, but no network getting it done.</p>
<p>      Until now. For the past year Brooklyn Poets has been designing and laying the groundwork for such a network. In homage to Hart Crane, we call this The Bridge. And you can help build it.</p>
<p><b>TWO KEY THINGS THE BRIDGE WILL DO</b></p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>
<b>Help student poets find mentor poets</b> to get critiques of their work without having to go through a workshop structure or writing program.</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b>Help mentor poets find student poets </b>by offering critiquing services — at their own prices.</li></ul>
<p></p>
<p>     Students find mentors for less money than a workshop or writing program would cost, and mentors get paid without having to land one of those hard-to-find teaching jobs. It's that simple.</p>
<p>     Students choose mentors based on price, services offered, location and other factors such as skills and stylistic influences. If they like, they can sign up for workshops proposed by mentors--workshops not governed by the mandates of any institution, for however long mentors want, with however many students, at whatever price, online or on site. </p>
<p><b>AND THAT'S NOT ALL</b></p>
<p>     You'll have <b>Readers</b>, not Followers.</p>
<p>     You'll <b>create new work</b>. Each week on The Bridge we’ll feature a poetry assignment proposed by a mentor in our community.</p>
<p>     <b>Sharing your work will be a creative process</b>. You can choose images to represent your poems and captions to go with them—like book covers for your individual poems. Add tags so readers can find your poems based on similar interests.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/123302/files/20131009093840-Bridge_Upload.jpg?1381336720"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>     When a reader clicks on one of your poems, a lightbox
will open up featuring the text of the poem in a clean layout. Readers can
comment on your work, like it or star it for safekeeping in their own <b>catalogue</b> of favorite poems, quotes, words and books on The Bridge.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p>     Awesome, right? You can share your favorite <b>quotes</b> and <b>words</b> on the Bridge as well as your <b>books</b> in the same beautiful format as your poems. You can include photos of your <b>writing space</b> and <b>library </b>along with your bio, skills and influences and links to other sites.</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>     All this to put <b>more
attention on reading and the written word</b> than ever before, to create a deeper, more dynamic community of readers and writers.</p>
<p><b>STILL GOT QUESTIONS?</b></p>
<p><b>     </b>Check out the FAQ at the bottom of this page for more details on how mentorship on The Bridge will work. Scroll through all those awesome perks on the way!</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>WHY WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT</b></p>
<p>     Worstofalldesign, the design team behind the new <a href=""http://brooklynpoets.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Brooklyn Poets</a> website, has already designed The
Bridge—we’ve covered that expense. And we've already paid our programming team to build the invite portion of the site so you can create an account right now and reserve your username for only a $10 donation. But the cost to develop the entire Bridge is steep; after all, this is a social networking site with an e-commerce platform built in.</p>
<p>     We could wait, and try to accrue the funds ourselves--but that could take years. Help us fund The Bridge now and we can have it up and running by the beginning of next
year. <b>Help pay for something that will <i>pay you back</i>. </b>If you’re looking for mentors and workshops, finding
them on The Bridge will cost you far less than enrolling in a graduate writing
program—and you’ll have hundreds of mentors and workshops to choose
from! If you’re a published poet looking for work, you can <i>make money </i>from the expertise that is
not currently being rewarded on the job market.</p>
<p>     We've set our fundraising goal at $20,000 but the total cost of development is $28,000. Help us meet our initial goal and we can begin development of The Bridge but will take on debt. Remember, even if we hit our initial goal, we lose 7% to Indiegogo and credit card fees and must also take out the cost of producing &amp; shipping our perks--and that ain't cheap. If we don't hit our goal, we lose 12%!</p>
<p>     <b>Our stretch goal is $40,000</b>. Help us hit that goal and we can cover all the fees and production &amp; shipping costs and fund the complete development of The Bridge.</p>
<p><b>PERKS</b></p>
<p>     As Jay-Z might say, We invented swag. We're gonna hook you up with something awesome for your money.</p>

But his passion for poetry, hip hop and acting led him to gifted mentors who recognized his talent and encouraged him to develop as an artist and a performer. As a poet he appeared the greatest number of times on HBO'S <i>Russell Simmons Presents Def Poetry</i>--eight times in six seasons. He won a Tony award for his writing and performance as an original cast member of <i>Russell Simmons Presents Def Poetry Jam on Broadway</i>, for which he was also nominated for a Drama Desk Award. His staged memoir <i>County of Kings: The Beautiful Struggle</i>, produced by Spike Lee, premiered at the Public Theater in 2009 to rave reviews from the <i><a href=""http://theater.nytimes.com/2009/10/13/theater/reviews/13county.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">New York Times</a></i>, <i>New Yorker </i>and <i><a href=""http://www.brooklynrail.org/2009/11/theater/lemon-andersen-from-public-enemy-to-public-theater"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Brooklyn Rail</a></i>, among others. Since then, he has toured the one-man show--which took the grand prize at the 2010 New York Book Festival--at campuses and theaters across the U.S. and on three continents. More recently, Andersen was the feature of the internationally acclaimed documentary <i>Lemon</i>, screened in 2012-2013 at film festivals and performing arts centers across North America. </p>

<p></p>
<p><b>FAQ</b></p>
<p><b>Will The Bridge be free?</b><br/><br/>     Yes. Anyone can use The Bridge for free. If you'd like to request a critique from a mentor or take a workshop, you'd pay whatever price was set by the mentor; but there is no requirement to do that. If you're simply interested in sharing your work on The Bridge and exploring others', that's all you have to do!<br/><br/><strong>Why do I have to pay at all?</strong><br/><br/>     We'd love to make everything free on The Bridge. But the fact is, mentor poets are already underpaid and overworked, and we're trying to help them as much as the students--we're trying to help them help each other. We're trying to change the culture of poetry education in this country, not contribute to the problem. You'd be paying a mentor because you value his or her particular expertise (that, say, your mom who loves all your poems can't offer), because that mentor is taking time out of what's likely a very busy schedule to give your work the sustained, focused attention it deserves.<br/><br/><strong>How many poems can I have critiqued and what will it cost?</strong><br/><br/>     You can submit any number of poems for critique based on the bundles offered by the mentor you choose. Brooklyn Poets will recommend several bundles to mentors at what we think are reasonable prices--and let the mentors decide what's right for them. For example:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>1 poem (1 pg) $15</li>
<li>1-2 poems (2 pgs) $20</li>
<li>3-5 poems (3-6 pgs) $40</li>
<li>Writing sample (10-12 pgs) $70</li>
<li>Chapbook (24-32 pgs) $100</li>
<li>Full-length book (48-64 pgs) $145</li>
</ul>     Again, these are recommended prices; mentors can offer cheaper or more expensive bundles based on the services they're offering and what they think those are worth.<br/><br/><strong>But what if I can't afford a mentor?</strong><br/><br/>      Here's the cool part: you can get free critiques. You can submit individual poems to the free critiques queue on The Bridge, which a prospective mentor will critique as part of the application process--you just wouldn't know the mentor's work or skills/influences or how long it would take to get your feedback.<br/><p></p>
<p><b>Can mentors choose which poems they want to critique?</b></p>
<p>     Yes. We don't think mentors should have to critique work they're not the best judge of--this doesn't serve the student or the mentor. Mentors can preview student work submitted for critique and accept or decline it. If declined a critique, students can move on to find other mentors without wasting their time or money on a mentor who's not excited about their work.</p>
<p><b>Can students provide feedback on mentors' critiques?</b></p>
<p>     Yes. After receiving a critique or taking a workshop, students can leave feedback about a mentor's work, which only we and the mentor will see. Mentors can earn stars based on the number of positive ratings they receive. The better the critiques, the more stars a mentor can earn, attracting more students. Too many negative ratings of a certain kind and a poet can be stripped of mentorship privileges.</p>
<p><b>Is a comment on a poem the same thing as a critique?</b></p>
<p>     No. Anyone is free to comment on a poem on The Bridge, including mentors, but that is not what we mean by a critique. A critique would be, at the very least, a rigorous written response to a student's work that a mentor would return to a student's inbox on The Bridge. A mentor might offer more critiquing services than that for a higher price, including off-site phone or video conferencing or in-person meetings, but that is up to each mentor.</p>
<p><b>How will mentors get paid?</b></p>
<p>     Students will pay mentors for critiques and workshops through our secure e-commerce platform. Mentors will get paid by direct deposit into the bank account they've linked to the site. Brooklyn Poets will take a small percentage of the payment for setting up, handling and securing the transaction.</p>
<p><b>When will I get my perks?</b></p>
<p>     We're planning to have any material perks to you by Christmas (wristbands, tees, books, etc.), so you can enjoy your holiday season in style and/or give someone else the gift of swag. You can get The Bridge perk right now for any $10-and-above contribution--we'll send you an invite so you can reserve your username before the network opens to the public. Straightrazor, Voyager, Bard and Lemon's Crew perks can be picked up on November 21, the night of Lemon Andersen's performance at the Irondale in Fort Greene, provided we already have them in stock. If your perk includes a Brooklyn Poets membership, the membership begins the date you make your contribution and is good for one year; so if you purchase the Voyager perk, for instance, you'll get free admission to the next Yawp on our calendar.</p>
<p><b>How do I choose what I want if my perk includes options?</b></p>
<p>     Once we've received your contribution, we'll contact you to find out which t-shirt color/style/size you want, or which faculty book or B.I.G. photo, etc.<br/></p>
<p><b>Is my contribution tax-deductible?</b></p>
<p>     Not yet. We’re incorporated as a 501(c)(3)-type nonprofit in New York, but are still in the process of applying for 501(c)(3) status from the IRS, so contributions are not yet tax-deductible but hopefully will be soon.<br/></p>

TWO KEY THINGS THE BRIDGE WILL DO


Help student poets find mentor poets to get critiques of their work without having to go through a workshop structure or writing program.

Help mentor poets find student poets by offering critiquing services — at their own prices.

     Students find mentors for less money than a workshop or writing program would cost, and mentors get paid without having to land one of those hard-to-find teaching jobs. It's that simple.
     Students choose mentors based on price, services offered, location and other factors such as skills and stylistic influences. If they like, they can sign up for workshops proposed by mentors--workshops not governed by the mandates of any institution, for however long mentors want, with however many students, at whatever price, online or on site. 
AND THAT'S NOT ALL
     You'll have Readers, not Followers.
     You'll create new work. Each week on The Bridge we’ll feature a poetry assignment proposed by a mentor in our community.
     Sharing your work will be a creative process. You can choose images to represent your poems and captions to go with them—like book covers for your individual poems. Add tags so readers can find your poems based on similar interests.









     When a reader clicks on one of your poems, a lightbox
will open up featuring the text of the poem in a clean layout. Readers can
comment on your work, like it or star it for safekeeping in their own catalogue of favorite poems, quotes, words and books on The Bridge.








     Awesome, right? You can share your favorite quotes and words on the Bridge as well as your books in the same beautiful format as your poems. You can include photos of your writing space and library along with your bio, skills and influences and links to other sites.






     All this to put more
attention on reading and the written word than ever before, to create a deeper, more dynamic community of readers and writers.
STILL GOT QUESTIONS?
     Check out the FAQ at the bottom of this page for more details on how mentorship on The Bridge will work. Scroll through all those awesome perks on the way!



WHY WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT
     Worstofalldesign, the design team behind the new Brooklyn Poets website, has already designed The
Bridge—we’ve covered that expense. And we've already paid our programming team to build the invite portion of the site so you can create an account right now and reserve your username for only a $10 donation. But the cost to develop the entire Bridge is steep; after all, this is a social networking site with an e-commerce platform built in.
     We could wait, and try to accrue the funds ourselves--but that could take years. Help us fund The Bridge now and we can have it up and running by the beginning of next
year. Help pay for something that will pay you back. If you’re looking for mentors and workshops, finding
them on The Bridge will cost you far less than enrolling in a graduate writing
program—and you’ll have hundreds of mentors and workshops to choose
from! If you’re a published poet looking for work, you can make money from the expertise that is
not currently being rewarded on the job market.
     We've set our fundraising goal at $20,000 but the total cost of development is $28,000. Help us meet our initial goal and we can begin development of The Bridge but will take on debt. Remember, even if we hit our initial goal, we lose 7% to Indiegogo and credit card fees and must also take out the cost of producing & shipping our perks--and that ain't cheap. If we don't hit our goal, we lose 12%!
     Our stretch goal is $40,000. Help us hit that goal and we can cover all the fees and production & shipping costs and fund the complete development of The Bridge.

     As Jay-Z might say, We invented swag. We're gonna hook you up with something awesome for your money.

Lemon Andersen Straightrazor Book-Launch(for STRAIGHTRAZOR and VOYAGER and higher perks)

     On Thursday, November 21, the final night of this campaign, Brooklyn Poets will present a book-launch benefit performance by Tony Award winner Lemon Andersen at the Irondale in Fort Greene. Andersen will read from his new collection of poems, Straightrazor, and all ticket holders will receive a signed copy of the book. Doors open at 7, performance at 7:30. 

     Raised in Brooklyn, Lemon Andersen watched his mother, father and stepfather die from heroin abuse and AIDS complications, leaving him and his brother to grow up alone and impoverished. But his passion for poetry, hip hop and acting led him to gifted mentors who recognized his talent and encouraged him to develop as an artist and a performer. As a poet he appeared the greatest number of times on HBO'S Russell Simmons Presents Def Poetry--eight times in six seasons. He won a Tony award for his writing and performance as an original cast member of Russell Simmons Presents Def Poetry Jam on Broadway, for which he was also nominated for a Drama Desk Award. His staged memoir County of Kings: The Beautiful Struggle, produced by Spike Lee, premiered at the Public Theater in 2009 to rave reviews from the New York Times, New Yorker and Brooklyn Rail, among others. Since then, he has toured the one-man show--which took the grand prize at the 2010 New York Book Festival--at campuses and theaters across the U.S. and on three continents. More recently, Andersen was the feature of the internationally acclaimed documentary Lemon, screened in 2012-2013 at film festivals and performing arts centers across North America.

OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP

     If you want to contribute and like one of our tees but prefer to buy it individually, visit our swag store and get it there--though you're getting a deal and saving on shipping through these perk packages. Or come to one of our upcoming events (YAWP or Reading Series) and get some swag or make a donation there. Or visit our Memberships & Donations page and contribute that way. Or just spread the word on Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, etc, or by writing an article or blogging about The Bridge. Every little bit helps.

FAQ
Will The Bridge be free?     Yes. Anyone can use The Bridge for free. If you'd like to request a critique from a mentor or take a workshop, you'd pay whatever price was set by the mentor; but there is no requirement to do that. If you're simply interested in sharing your work on The Bridge and exploring others', that's all you have to do!Why do I have to pay at all?     We'd love to make everything free on The Bridge. But the fact is, mentor poets are already underpaid and overworked, and we're trying to help them as much as the students--we're trying to help them help each other. We're trying to change the culture of poetry education in this country, not contribute to the problem. You'd be paying a mentor because you value his or her particular expertise (that, say, your mom who loves all your poems can't offer), because that mentor is taking time out of what's likely a very busy schedule to give your work the sustained, focused attention it deserves.How many poems can I have critiqued and what will it cost?     You can submit any number of poems for critique based on the bundles offered by the mentor you choose. Brooklyn Poets will recommend several bundles to mentors at what we think are reasonable prices--and let the mentors decide what's right for them. For example:


1 poem (1 pg) $15
1-2 poems (2 pgs) $20
3-5 poems (3-6 pgs) $40
Writing sample (10-12 pgs) $70
Chapbook (24-32 pgs) $100
Full-length book (48-64 pgs) $145
     Again, these are recommended prices; mentors can offer cheaper or more expensive bundles based on the services they're offering and what they think those are worth.But what if I can't afford a mentor?      Here's the cool part: you can get free critiques. You can submit individual poems to the free critiques queue on The Bridge, which a prospective mentor will critique as part of the application process--you just wouldn't know the mentor's work or skills/influences or how long it would take to get your feedback.
Can mentors choose which poems they want to critique?
     Yes. We don't think mentors should have to critique work they're not the best judge of--this doesn't serve the student or the mentor. Mentors can preview student work submitted for critique and accept or decline it. If declined a critique, students can move on to find other mentors without wasting their time or money on a mentor who's not excited about their work.
Can students provide feedback on mentors' critiques?
     Yes. After receiving a critique or taking a workshop, students can leave feedback about a mentor's work, which only we and the mentor will see. Mentors can earn stars based on the number of positive ratings they receive. The better the critiques, the more stars a mentor can earn, attracting more students. Too many negative ratings of a certain kind and a poet can be stripped of mentorship privileges.
Is a comment on a poem the same thing as a critique?
     No. Anyone is free to comment on a poem on The Bridge, including mentors, but that is not what we mean by a critique. A critique would be, at the very least, a rigorous written response to a student's work that a mentor would return to a student's inbox on The Bridge. A mentor might offer more critiquing services than that for a higher price, including off-site phone or video conferencing or in-person meetings, but that is up to each mentor.
How will mentors get paid?
     Students will pay mentors for critiques and workshops through our secure e-commerce platform. Mentors will get paid by direct deposit into the bank account they've linked to the site. Brooklyn Poets will take a small percentage of the payment for setting up, handling and securing the transaction.
When will I get my perks?
     We're planning to have any material perks to you by Christmas (wristbands, tees, books, etc.), so you can enjoy your holiday season in style and/or give someone else the gift of swag. You can get The Bridge perk right now for any $10-and-above contribution--we'll send you an invite so you can reserve your username before the network opens to the public. Straightrazor, Voyager, Bard and Lemon's Crew perks can be picked up on November 21, the night of Lemon Andersen's performance at the Irondale in Fort Greene, provided we already have them in stock. If your perk includes a Brooklyn Poets membership, the membership begins the date you make your contribution and is good for one year; so if you purchase the Voyager perk, for instance, you'll get free admission to the next Yawp on our calendar.
How do I choose what I want if my perk includes options?
     Once we've received your contribution, we'll contact you to find out which t-shirt color/style/size you want, or which faculty book or B.I.G. photo, etc.
Is my contribution tax-deductible?
     Not yet. We’re incorporated as a 501(c)(3)-type nonprofit in New York, but are still in the process of applying for 501(c)(3) status from the IRS, so contributions are not yet tax-deductible but hopefully will be soon.

<p><em>The Players</em> is the true story of my misadventures dating a series of famous athletes.</p>
<p>Everybody wants to find love. Nobody wants to be played, lied to, or cheated on. I want to make sure this doesn't happen to you. I want to make sure you see the signs.</p>
<p>The players is a heartfelt book about my journey to find love, and what I found instead.</p>
<p>After you read this you'll know how to detect a Player before they even have a chance to break your heart. It's up to you to take yourself out of the game after that. I can give you the tips, you'll see the red flags immeditely. However I can't be there to hold your hand, and drag you away from these smooth talkers.</p>
<p>For those who love to peek inside celebrities private lives, I offer plenty of hot steamy details of what it's like to date a professional athlete. All the perks, the fun, the sleazy side, and the drama. </p>
<p>I can tell you how to meet, and attract any guy you want.</p>
<p>Would I recommend having flings, and living in the moment. I'm not sure. I would however say to proceed with caution, and make sure you have your head on straight.</p>
<p>My past is for you to learn your own lessons from. My life is an open book. Everyone deserves to at least know what kind of messed up mind games, and sexual games are being played out there.</p>
<p>I wrote The Players as a way to use my experiences as a vehicle to entertain, inform, and help other women avoid the same mistakes I made. Because sometimes loneliness can make you do crazy things…</p>
<p>By contributing to my Indiegogo campaign, you will be helping me share my stories with the world.

And if you can contribute today, thank you for your support.</p></div>","Campaign for Lisa to Publish The Players
My name is Lisa Monks and I am launching this Indiegogo Campaign in order to raise funds to publish my memoir The Players with Iguana Books, an independent publishing house in Toronto.
The Players is the true story of my misadventures dating a series of famous athletes.
Everybody wants to find love. Nobody wants to be played, lied to, or cheated on. I want to make sure this doesn't happen to you. I want to make sure you see the signs.
The players is a heartfelt book about my journey to find love, and what I found instead.
After you read this you'll know how to detect a Player before they even have a chance to break your heart. It's up to you to take yourself out of the game after that. I can give you the tips, you'll see the red flags immeditely. However I can't be there to hold your hand, and drag you away from these smooth talkers.
For those who love to peek inside celebrities private lives, I offer plenty of hot steamy details of what it's like to date a professional athlete. All the perks, the fun, the sleazy side, and the drama. 
I can tell you how to meet, and attract any guy you want.
Would I recommend having flings, and living in the moment. I'm not sure. I would however say to proceed with caution, and make sure you have your head on straight.
My past is for you to learn your own lessons from. My life is an open book. Everyone deserves to at least know what kind of messed up mind games, and sexual games are being played out there.
I wrote The Players as a way to use my experiences as a vehicle to entertain, inform, and help other women avoid the same mistakes I made. Because sometimes loneliness can make you do crazy things…
By contributing to my Indiegogo campaign, you will be helping me share my stories with the world. Please follow me on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to keep in touch, get updates on the publishing process, and to learn when and where you can read all the juicy details of my scintillating exploits.
 

Sample Chapter
Internet dating  


I’m not against it, unless it’s me. All my friends who lived through these experiences with me really need to stop pushing me to try the internet again. It pisses me off when I have to remind people the same people over and over again, why I'm never ever going to try it again. 


If the experiences I had weren’t obvious warning signs that the love of my life is not on the internet then I don’t know what is. But you don’t need to hit me over the head  twice when things turn out this bad. After these disastrous encounters I got the message. The right man is out there somewhere for me, but he sure as hell isn’t on the internet. My first experience was when I flew to California. I picked someone in Cali, because I’d always wanted to live there. I figured I may as well meet someone there, since I didn't want to live in Canada for the rest of my life. 
Everyone kept bugging me to try dating on the internet, so I gave in and tried it. I went fishing, and boy did I come up with quite the catch. After talking on the phone for a few months I decided to fly out there. One of his pictures wasn’t him at all, it was a male model, and the other one was him 30lbs lighter, and 15 years younger, lean and ripped. It’s was a lie. It's wrong to have someone fly half way across the country for a lie. I figured I was there, I'd taken the time off work I may as well try to get to know him, and see if there could be any kind of relationship between us. 
He asked me to share an entrée with him, my first night there. He had no groceries, no money. By my third night he said if I wanted to eat I had to pay. 
This was bullshit. I paid for my own flight and hotel. I took care of  all my expenses during the day while he was at work, and he couldn’t even spring for dinner, and a movie, or groceries. 
One afternoon he left me at his place, and I decided to snoop through his stuff, something didn't seem right. I found a piece of paper that said there was a warrant out for his arrest. Don’t even try to criticize me for that, with all his sketchy behavior, I had a right to know what kind of guy I was dealing with. I’d been scammed, and I wanted to find out the truth about this guy. Then I found a letter from one of his ex-girlfriends about him cheating on her. She said in the letter that she couldn’t believe someone that acted so in love with her could do such a terrible thing to her. 
I immediately called my sister, and she said get the hell out of there. I called the airline and changed my flight to leave that night. I had to pay a hundred dollars more just to get the hell out of there.....cont. in the update section

I have been avoiding this question like the plague ever since starting college and realizing that what I loved to do was most emphatically *not* what I loved learning about. Throughout my post-collegiate life, I have witnessed with stronger and stronger conviction that a person's job, career, and academic interest are not necessarily all the same thing. So far, I have been lucky enough to pursue jobs and academic interests and, now, I would like to pursue a career: writing.</p><p>Writing has always been a part of me, the strongest bridge I seem to have between the world(s) inside me and the world around me. It is the way I can communicate. It is the way I can show people how much they mean to me and what they have taught me. It is my expression. It is my magic. </p><p>And I feel a little stupid for trying to ignore it as much as I have. Writers don't make very much money. Writers are crazy. Writing is a dying art form. Anyone can be a writer... Lies I've been told and have been telling myself for years have kept me trying to do something else with myself. </p><p>Well, I am ready to embrace the writer in me. I'm ready to forgive myself for all my silent days. I'm ready to dedicate myself to my craft. I hope I've proven that to some degree, by publishing my first novel, So Echoes the Thunder. I have learned so much through the experience, and I never want to stop. </p><p>However, this presents a problem. As throughout most of this project, I've been using my brother's computer (thanks, Tris!) and am now using my mom's laptop (thanks, mom!). My own laptop is unusable, which is why I am starting this campaign. In order to be a writer, I need a reliable laptop, so I can write and save and access my stories, as well as be able to electronically handle all the steps towards publication. </p><p>I also recently had the chance to speak with a wonderful woman about setting up a website for me, as an author, that could link me to my books' pages, social media, and several other features. So this campaign is also to raise money for creation of that webpage. </p> <p></p> <p> </p><h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>To be the best writer I can be, I need a reliable writing tool. In the past, I have gotten less expensive windows laptops, and they have all failed within the first year of purchase. So, this time, I am raising money for a Mac. The first $1200 I raise will go towards a Macbook. The rest will go towards my website and purchasing a decent word processing software.</p><p>In return, along with all the stories your little eyes, ears, and hearts could hope for from me, there are quite a few perks for you. I love getting people involved and the more people I can work with, collaborate with, and give to, the better!</p><ul></ul><p></p> <p> </p><h3><font color=""#000000"">Other Ways You Can Help</font></h3> <p>If you are as poor as I am, and cannot offer monetary support- that's ok. I still love you! I still want to share this experience with you. You could share this page with your friends. You can cheer me on and help get my name out there to the world. You can bring me smiles and caffeine when I'm on a writing streak. And, most importantly, you can still read my stories. </p><p>After all, that's what this is all about. Getting the stories heard.</p></div>","Summary ""What are you doing with your life?""Ah, the question that every young professional dreads, but must face at some point in their life or another.

As throughout most of this project, I've been using my brother's computer (thanks, Tris!) and am now using my mom's laptop (thanks, mom!). My own laptop is unusable, which is why I am starting this campaign. In order to be a writer, I need a reliable laptop, so I can write and save and access my stories, as well as be able to electronically handle all the steps towards publication. I also recently had the chance to speak with a wonderful woman about setting up a website for me, as an author, that could link me to my books' pages, social media, and several other features. So this campaign is also to raise money for creation of that webpage.    What I Need & What You Get To be the best writer I can be, I need a reliable writing tool. In the past, I have gotten less expensive windows laptops, and they have all failed within the first year of purchase. So, this time, I am raising money for a Mac. The first $1200 I raise will go towards a Macbook. The rest will go towards my website and purchasing a decent word processing software.In return, along with all the stories your little eyes, ears, and hearts could hope for from me, there are quite a few perks for you. I love getting people involved and the more people I can work with, collaborate with, and give to, the better!  Other Ways You Can Help If you are as poor as I am, and cannot offer monetary support- that's ok. I still love you! I still want to share this experience with you. You could share this page with your friends. You can cheer me on and help get my name out there to the world. You can bring me smiles and caffeine when I'm on a writing streak. And, most importantly, you can still read my stories. After all, that's what this is all about. Getting the stories heard.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

schizophrenia.</span></p>
<h2><b>Diagnosed with Schizophrenia</b></h2>
<p>Bill MacPhee was a typical normal young
person, but then in 1987 his life changed forever. He began suffering from
delusions, paranoia and depression and found himself isolated in a psychiatric
ward. He was 24 years old and diagnosed with schizophrenia.  Bill was very ill, he was
hospitalized six times, lived in three different group homes and he had a suicide
attempt.</p>
<h2><b>Bill
MacPhee – An Inspiration of Hope</b></h2>
<p>Despite living with the
stigma of the name and unable to find few resources, Bill refused to spend the
rest of his life lying on a couch.  With the help of medication, therapy, the renewed support of family
and a new network of friends, he progressed to the point where he is now able
to undertake the daily challenge of managing his illness. Today he is happily married with three children and a business of his
own.  It was not an easy road, but he was
able to find hope and purpose in his life. Success stories involving people
with schizophrenia are rare.  Bill
MacPhee is a text book case of schizophrenia and as a role model he is an
inspiration to others.</p>
<h2><b>Change the Stigma - Change the Name </b></h2>
<p>After learning to deal with this illness
and experiencing first-hand the lack of support and the stigma associated with
the name, motivated Bill to reach out to others faced with the same diagnosis.  </p>
<p>Bill wants to raise money to fund a
speaking tour throughout North America in 2014 to spread knowledge about schizophrenia
and to work toward changing the name “Schizophrenia” to “MacPhee Syndrome.”  </p>
<p>Renaming schizophrenia to “MacPhee
Syndrome” will reverse the misnomer and will allow for the public to be
re-informed about the symptoms of the illness and reduce the fear that is
directed towards those who suffer from the illness. </p>
<p>The money raised for this campaign will
be used to pay for travel and venue expenses for himself and a small team of
supporters.  The funds will also be used
to help pay for publicity which will help inform the public.</p>
<h2><b>Helping
those dealing with Schizophrenia </b></h2>
<p>As part of his desire to help those
dealing with schizophrenia, he began a publishing company, “Magpie Media”, to
help spread awareness about schizophrenia. </p>
<p>Magpie Media began publishing SZ
Magazine in 1994 for quarterly distribution in Canada and later in the United
States. The magazine, which is the only one of its kind in North America,
provides information about mental illness to the community and professionals.  Ruth Baruuk, a Toronto psychiatrist, reported
that “she reads every issue cover to cover.” 
It also provides a platform for advertisers to directly reach those who
need their products.</p>

speeches, provided consulting services and just recently finished an
autobiography that is both informative and encouraging.  He is already well known as a spokesperson for
families who are challenged by this illness. 
Some of his many awards include: <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">2011 Kaiser Foundation National Awards for Excellence- Media, Reporting, </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">2009 Transforming Lives Award (Center for Addiction and Mental Health), </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">2007 Ontario Psychiatric Association Theodore Allen Sweet Award</span></p><p></p>
<p>All donations will be greatly
appreciated.  Help us to inform a wider
section of the public as we work towards changing the name and stigma of
schizophrenia to “MacPhee Syndrome.”</p>

help themselves.<p></p>

After learning to deal with this illness
and experiencing first-hand the lack of support and the stigma associated with
the name, motivated Bill to reach out to others faced with the same diagnosis.  
Bill wants to raise money to fund a
speaking tour throughout North America in 2014 to spread knowledge about schizophrenia
and to work toward changing the name “Schizophrenia” to “MacPhee Syndrome.”  
Renaming schizophrenia to “MacPhee
Syndrome” will reverse the misnomer and will allow for the public to be
re-informed about the symptoms of the illness and reduce the fear that is
directed towards those who suffer from the illness. 
The money raised for this campaign will
be used to pay for travel and venue expenses for himself and a small team of
supporters.  The funds will also be used
to help pay for publicity which will help inform the public.
Helping
those dealing with Schizophrenia 
As part of his desire to help those
dealing with schizophrenia, he began a publishing company, “Magpie Media”, to
help spread awareness about schizophrenia. 
Magpie Media began publishing SZ
Magazine in 1994 for quarterly distribution in Canada and later in the United
States. The magazine, which is the only one of its kind in North America,
provides information about mental illness to the community and professionals.  Ruth Baruuk, a Toronto psychiatrist, reported
that “she reads every issue cover to cover.” 
It also provides a platform for advertisers to directly reach those who
need their products.
Bill has delivered inspirational
speeches, provided consulting services and just recently finished an
autobiography that is both informative and encouraging.  He is already well known as a spokesperson for
families who are challenged by this illness. 
Some of his many awards include: 2011 Kaiser Foundation National Awards for Excellence- Media, Reporting, 2009 Transforming Lives Award (Center for Addiction and Mental Health), 2007 Ontario Psychiatric Association Theodore Allen Sweet Award
All donations will be greatly
appreciated.  Help us to inform a wider
section of the public as we work towards changing the name and stigma of
schizophrenia to “MacPhee Syndrome.”
Follow us as Bill pursues his dream of helping others
help themselves.

Louche-Pelissier, fort de son expérience de voyageur, de son expertise en
Programmation Neurolinguistique (PNL) et en Hypnose, a su conjuguer la
compréhension du travail sur l’inconscient au plaisir de lire un conte ou une
histoire.</p>
<p>Chaque
histoire de ce livre a été conçue de manière à permettre l’ouverture à de
nouvelles pistes de compréhension. Aussi les histoires valorisent l’être
intérieur et l’invitent à trouver des solutions qui sauront rejoindre tout être
vivant dans son développement.</p>
<p>Je
vous invite à profiter pleinement de cette lecture et à partager, via le
conteur qui s’éveille en vous, les histoires que vous découvrirez dans les
pages suivantes.  </p>
<p>Les
lire pour soi ou les conter aux autres libère le bonheur du cœur !</p>
<p><b>Isabelle
David (Idcom international)</b></p>
<p><b>Explication
du projet</b></p>
<p>Bonjour, mon nom est Patrick LP. Je suis coach
professionnel certifié en PNL. Et je suis avant tout un accompagnateur de
voyages intérieurs. J’ai besoin de votre aide pour faire voyager mes histoires
parmi vous.</p>
<p>Saviez-vous que <i>métaphore</i>
vient du grec, et signifie <i>transport </i>?
Ces métaphores vous transporteront naturellement d’un état à un autre, d’une
réalité à une autre, elles vous permettront de voir l’autre côté de la montagne
qui se dresse devant vous. Une métaphore, c’est la clé pour ouvrir le coffre
aux trésors de vos ressources, de vos savoirs et de vos compétences cachés.</p>
<p>Pour être percutante et efficace<b>,</b> une métaphore se construit avec la personne qui est en face de
vous, en observant l’état dans lequel elle est, en notant les ressources dont
elle a besoin et en voyageant avec elle vers ce qu’elle désire, vers son
objectif. C’est vraiment une histoire de connexion. </p>
<p>En fonction de la situation (deuil, conflit
intérieur, acquisition de nouvelles compétences ou changement de comportement),
je construis une partie de mon histoire sur une technique de PNL ou d’Hypnose
avec un ingrédient spécial. Cet ingrédient est particulier pour chacun d’entre
nous. Ce peut être l’Amour, l’Intention, l’Empathie ou la Relation. Le nom
importe peu mais sachez que c’est lui qui<span> 
fera une différence. </span></p>
<p>Dans ce recueil, les métaphores que je partage sont
réécrites de façon plus personnelle, plus poétique. L’ingrédient dont je
parlais plus haut est toujours présent. L’idée est de vous faire vibrer au plus
profond de vos cellules, de faire bouger quelque chose en vous de façon consciente
ou inconsciente. Vous pouvez lire ces histoires en écoutant de la musique ou
entouré de nature. Vous pouvez demander qu’on vous les raconte ou les raconter
à quelqu’un d’autre (les enfants sont un merveilleux public). Un point
important sera de poser une intention avant de lire, d’entendre ou de sentir
ces histoires qui seront pour vous autant de voyages et d’aventures.</p>
<p><b>Nous sommes tous reliés et c’est l’entraide qui va
transformer notre monde.</b> Nous sommes les créateurs de notre vie. Nous sommes
une multitude de vies, d’instruments ou de gens qui vibrent ensemble. Comme
tous les membres d’un orchestre symphonique, nous sommes tous importants. Comme
les éclats de Corie dans un bâton de pluie, vous êtes tous importants. Ensemble
comme les milliards de gouttes d’eau qui forment un océan. Égales mais avec un
rôle différent. <b>Pour que le rêve
devienne réalité, j’ai besoin de votre aide.</b></p>

  HAUT
ET BAS  

Patrick
Louche-Pelissier, fort de son expérience de voyageur, de son expertise en
Programmation Neurolinguistique (PNL) et en Hypnose, a su conjuguer la
compréhension du travail sur l’inconscient au plaisir de lire un conte ou une
histoire.
Chaque
histoire de ce livre a été conçue de manière à permettre l’ouverture à de
nouvelles pistes de compréhension. Aussi les histoires valorisent l’être
intérieur et l’invitent à trouver des solutions qui sauront rejoindre tout être
vivant dans son développement.
Je
vous invite à profiter pleinement de cette lecture et à partager, via le
conteur qui s’éveille en vous, les histoires que vous découvrirez dans les
pages suivantes.  
Les
lire pour soi ou les conter aux autres libère le bonheur du cœur !

Explication
du projet
Bonjour, mon nom est Patrick LP. Je suis coach
professionnel certifié en PNL. Et je suis avant tout un accompagnateur de
voyages intérieurs. J’ai besoin de votre aide pour faire voyager mes histoires
parmi vous.
Saviez-vous que métaphore
vient du grec, et signifie transport ?
Ces métaphores vous transporteront naturellement d’un état à un autre, d’une
réalité à une autre, elles vous permettront de voir l’autre côté de la montagne
qui se dresse devant vous. Une métaphore, c’est la clé pour ouvrir le coffre
aux trésors de vos ressources, de vos savoirs et de vos compétences cachés.
Pour être percutante et efficace, une métaphore se construit avec la personne qui est en face de
vous, en observant l’état dans lequel elle est, en notant les ressources dont
elle a besoin et en voyageant avec elle vers ce qu’elle désire, vers son
objectif. C’est vraiment une histoire de connexion. 
En fonction de la situation (deuil, conflit
intérieur, acquisition de nouvelles compétences ou changement de comportement),
je construis une partie de mon histoire sur une technique de PNL ou d’Hypnose
avec un ingrédient spécial. Cet ingrédient est particulier pour chacun d’entre
nous. Ce peut être l’Amour, l’Intention, l’Empathie ou la Relation. Le nom
importe peu mais sachez que c’est lui qui 
fera une différence. 
Dans ce recueil, les métaphores que je partage sont
réécrites de façon plus personnelle, plus poétique. L’ingrédient dont je
parlais plus haut est toujours présent. L’idée est de vous faire vibrer au plus
profond de vos cellules, de faire bouger quelque chose en vous de façon consciente
ou inconsciente. Vous pouvez lire ces histoires en écoutant de la musique ou
entouré de nature. Vous pouvez demander qu’on vous les raconte ou les raconter
à quelqu’un d’autre (les enfants sont un merveilleux public). Un point
important sera de poser une intention avant de lire, d’entendre ou de sentir
ces histoires qui seront pour vous autant de voyages et d’aventures.
Nous sommes tous reliés et c’est l’entraide qui va
transformer notre monde. Nous sommes les créateurs de notre vie. Nous sommes
une multitude de vies, d’instruments ou de gens qui vibrent ensemble. Comme
tous les membres d’un orchestre symphonique, nous sommes tous importants. Comme
les éclats de Corie dans un bâton de pluie, vous êtes tous importants. Ensemble
comme les milliards de gouttes d’eau qui forment un océan. Égales mais avec un
rôle différent. Pour que le rêve
devienne réalité, j’ai besoin de votre aide.

 the last 45 years I’ve lived an extraordinary life as an Evolutionary Gypsy. I'm going to share my own story.  An e-book about my life so far, the
    lessons I've learned that have allowed me to embrace my own wacky
    happiness. I also hope that while my book reaches other adults like
    me, who have not embraced their unique selves yet, that it also
    finds its way into the hands of adolescents or young adults, before
    they start trying to make themselves over in the image they think
    they see around them. Can you imagine the future wingnuts like us
    who get their uniqueness early on and don't waste valuable time
    trying to fit in and be normal.  They could spend that time being
    themselves- creating, growing, sharing and just brightening the
    world for all of us.<br/><br/><p>This book will include lots of now-humorous short 
stories including my escape from China, and being escorted to the plane 
by armed guards in Tahiti.. really, that was a little overkill on their 
part.</p>
<p>

    If we want kids to live fuller lives and express themselves in
    healthy ways; if we want to curb youth violence, depression and even
    suicide- then we need to help them change their lives.<br/></p>

    I have spent my whole life living a lifestyle that most people only 
dream about. It is not out of reach for many of them, but they think it 
is, and so therefore don't try. At the same time, as I was growing up 
and always the new kid, I was harassed and bullied and teased. So, this 
book will serve several purposes. It will inspire people to go ahead and
 reach for whatever it is they want.  At the same time I hope it will 
help guide younger readers to stay their course-  not veer from the path they know and feel 
is right, but are feeling pressured to change.<p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>Right now, I just need basic funding for research and development of an ebook.  I am an accomplished writer and this will be my first ebook, so I will be learning the process and formatting etc. I'm a hands-on, DIY kind of gal, an Evolutionary Gypsy characteristic. The amount I chose as a goal, combined with my own savings, covers 6 months of time and resources to put this together. This is just step one in a long process. Find me on facebook and follow the process there or here. <br/></p><ul>
<li>My goal is $6,000 to comfortably do this project right. I understand you don't know me- I really encourage you to check me out on facebook. That is the real me with lots of real friends whom I have actually met.  I really am a writer, speaker, coach and story-teller and I really am going to complete this project and many more that will make a difference in so many lives. <br/>
</li>
<li>Funders will receive personal attention. Personal notes of thanks along with their ebook, Shout-outs for all to see and mentions in the actual book.  In the future, there will be even better perks, but right now, this is what I have to offer. <br/>
</li>
<li>I'll be writing this book anyway. I have chosen a flexible payout so whatever is funded is great and appreciated and helps me immensely. If I achieve the goal and then some, the extra will be going for the next step, which is workbooks and travel for workshops and seminars, and also development of the curriculum for the school programs. That will be discussed in a future funding campaign, and I think you'll like what you hear.  <br/>
</li>
</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p></p>The people who are floundering in their current lives, trying to convince themselves they are happy and the young people being bullied or who are surrounded by violence and a feeling of not-belonging, all have something in common. They haven't found themselves or hung onto themselves through their personal turmoil.  I get that. Life Lessons of an Evolutionary Gypsy is the book for them. <br/><p></p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p></p>If we want all of us to live fuller lives and express ourselves in healthy 
ways; if we want to curb youth violence, depression and even suicide- 
then we need to help change their lives. <br/><br/>

    There is no one size fits all mold anymore, if there ever was. We
    need to all embrace the wingnut inside of us.  <br/><br/>
Step one is writing and publishing  the book. Other steps include 
workbooks and workshops for people who are looking for change. Another 
part is a curriculum for schools as an invited guest speaker.   <br/><br/>
I'll share rough draft
    ideas and pages or blogs with you as we progress. After the book is
    finished and published as an ebook, I'll be speaking to groups about
    it and will create a series of workbooks and workshops for other
    evolutionary gypsies to leave the current  path and cut through the bramble
    over to their own, real path. But that is down the road. First step, this book.  <br/><br/>However, we need to get the word out. Please share this link with as many friends as you can. Post it on facebook and twitter and as many social media outlets as you happen to have access to. I will also continue to do some public speaking, even during the writing of this, and offering workshops, so feel free to book me.  In the future, when we have written materials to use for training, I'll be looking for other Evolutionary Gypsies who want to be on the front lines speaking with people and helping them one-on-one to embrace their true selves and find an outlet to express it. <br/><br/>

    I don't have a million followers or a thousand subscribers... I just
    have you. Together we can put something out into the world that will
    make a difference in so many lives and maybe even change the course
    of many. Join me.. get to know me... watch the process. We can do
    this. <p></p></div>","Short SummaryFor

<p>In September 2012, I self-published my first epic fantasy e-book, <a href=""https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/224399"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""A Noble's Quest"">A Noble's Quest</a>. Since then, I have published a mini-anthology of related short stories, <a href=""https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/321396"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Dawn: A dwarven story of creation"">Dawn: A dwarven story of creation</a>.</p>
<p>For most authors, they do not gain a following until they have published 5-6 books. Thus, understandably, in the few short months that my first book has been available, I have not earned enough to cover the costs of continuing on with the trilogy. However, it's my dream to write, and I am hoping that you can help me achieve this goal.</p>
<p>First, let me provide a short blurb so you know what this is all about!</p>
<p>The Tamorran Empire has entered a new golden age of cooperation and wealth. But even as the citizens rejoice, long forgotten dark forces beyond Tamor's borders awaken. Although Thomas, Sarentha, and Eliza thought they had dealt with their greatest foes, worse is yet to come. Wizard Ramar Wettias hopes to unearth ancient powers to help protect Tamor, and he needs to gamble the lives of Tamor's newest heroes to succeed.</p>
<p>There are several costs I need covered, so I will list them in order of priority:</p>
<p>Editing A Wizard's Gambit = $250 <strong>(Funded! Thank you!)</strong></p>
<p>Cover Art: A Noble's Quest = $500 <strong>(Funded! Amazing!)</strong></p>
<p>Cover Art: A Wizard's Gambit = $500 <em>($445 raised so far [$65 cash donated])</em></p>
<p>Editing A Hero's Birth (final book in trilogy, hopefully done next year) = $250</p>
<p>Cover Art: A Hero's Birth = $500</p>
<p>The editing services are to be provided by RJ Blain (<a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/a-wizard-s-gambit/x/3896405"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/a-wizard-s-gambit/x/3896405</a>)</p>
<p>The cover art is from Harvey Bunda <a href=""http://soulspline.cgsociety.org/gallery/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://soulspline.cgsociety.org/gallery/ </a></p>
<p>If I do not reach my entire goal, I will put the money aside until I can generate the rest myself to edit the books/generate cover art. Since this is a dream of mine, I will eventually get this trilogy published, but I would like to bring the books out in a timely manner for my readers. No one wants to wait years between books!</p>
<p>But what perks do you receive for donating to the cause?</p>
<p>$2 - My short story anthology, Dawn: A dwarven story of creation, as well as the following short story series. It will contain the backstory dealing with the antagonist from A Wizard's Gambit, ""Demon Invasion"" (working title, may change)</p>
<p>$5 - my first book, A Noble's Quest. If you already have it, you will receive A Wizard's Gambit when it is released. Plus the short story anthologies previously mentioned. <b>(NEW)</b> I will also include the digital artwork for the map from A Noble's Quest, remade by Harvey Bunda. <br/></p>
<p>$10 - both books, and the short story anthologies. You will receive A Wizard's Gambit before it officially goes on sale in thanks for your generous support! <b>(NEW)</b> Also, anyone who donates $10 or more will receive a digital copy of the cover art for A Noble's Quest as a wallpaper.</p>
<p>$25 - add a poster sized print of the cover art for A Noble's Quest, once it is created by Harvey Bunda.</p>
<p>$50 - all three e-books from the Empire's Foundation trilogy, plus all short story anthologies I create in the meantime, and all three posters for the entire trilogy's cover art. This one is a steal!</p>
<p>$100 - a lifetime of e-books. I'm only 34. That's a lot of years of writing left in me, so this could wind up being a great deal! (sorry, posters not included at this level... it's already a really good deal, and I'm taking a bath with the $50 level already!)</p>
<p>$500 - when I bring out the books in physical form, you will get this trilogy in paperback for free, and I will sign all the copies before mailing them out to you. Plus if the books move to other formats (e.g., games, movies, etc), you can expect to get some extra stuff in the mail from those! (plus everything previously listed)</p>
<p>$1000 - There can be only one... number one fan. If someone out there donates at this level, you get the autographed original hand drawn map used in A Noble's Quest along with a glowing letter of my eternal gratitude. I have another series planned for after this one, and you will also get that in paperback, signed.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, this project is incredibly important to me because I love to write, and I have just scratched the surface of the action, intrigue, and turmoil that my heroes will face. But I can't do this alone, and I need your help to bring this story to readers around the world.</p>
<p>One book won't do it. Many indie authors publish one book and get discouraged because they don't get rich quick. I want to be able to continue writing on the side for years to come, but at this moment in time that ideal is in jeopardy.</p>
<p>Even if you can't donate funds, you can still contribute to this campaign if you want to support my writing. Share this link, and generate interest! I don't know enough people personally to fund a project of this magnitude, so I am asking you to put the word out, and help me achieve my goal. Indiegogo provides sharing tools so we can easily reach as many people as possible.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

These novels were originally released in Japanese, but were translated to German and French, but not English.</p><p>I knew a little German and decided to order one of the German novels and proceeded to translate half of it into English (and fixed a few errors in the text as well). I tried to get Square-Enix to grant me permission to translate the whole series, but I was rejected (if anyone from SE is reading this, I'm still interested in doing that project!).</p><p>Anyway, I discovered I really liked translating German to English. I found a public domain collection of Japanese fairy tales that had been translated into German and translated that into English (so my English translation was a translation of a translation). </p><p>My favorite story from that collection can be found at my site, which is: <a href=""http://intellectualeconomy.wordpress.com/2013/06/21/the-wily-policeman/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://intellectualeconomy.wordpress.com/2013/06/21/the-wily-policeman/</a></p><p>After that, I translated a Sci-Fi novel from 1909 entitled Der Rote Komet (The Red Comet), which is about a comet (which we all know would really be a meteor) crashing to Earth in the far future and it's up to Romulus Futurus to find a way to save the Earth from impending doom.</p><p><b>What you are paying for:</b></p><p>You are paying for me to be able to work on more translation projects. For this project, I aim to translate four more novels into English. Once the deadline for this campaign passes, everyone who donates at least $2 will receive a digital copy of The Red Comet in their choice of format: ePub, .Mobi, or PDF, all DRM free (if you need your copy to be in some other format, let me know and I will see what I can do).</p><p>Currently, I am working on a translation of Der Tunnel (The Tunnel) by Bernhard Kellermann, a novel from 1913. So for the backers who purchase one of the further tiers, this would be the second novel you will receive.

These novels were originally released in Japanese, but were translated to German and French, but not English.I knew a little German and decided to order one of the German novels and proceeded to translate half of it into English (and fixed a few errors in the text as well). I tried to get Square-Enix to grant me permission to translate the whole series, but I was rejected (if anyone from SE is reading this, I'm still interested in doing that project!).Anyway, I discovered I really liked translating German to English. I found a public domain collection of Japanese fairy tales that had been translated into German and translated that into English (so my English translation was a translation of a translation). My favorite story from that collection can be found at my site, which is: http://intellectualeconomy.wordpress.com/2013/06/21/the-wily-policeman/After that, I translated a Sci-Fi novel from 1909 entitled Der Rote Komet (The Red Comet), which is about a comet (which we all know would really be a meteor) crashing to Earth in the far future and it's up to Romulus Futurus to find a way to save the Earth from impending doom.What you are paying for:You are paying for me to be able to work on more translation projects. For this project, I aim to translate four more novels into English. Once the deadline for this campaign passes, everyone who donates at least $2 will receive a digital copy of The Red Comet in their choice of format: ePub, .Mobi, or PDF, all DRM free (if you need your copy to be in some other format, let me know and I will see what I can do).Currently, I am working on a translation of Der Tunnel (The Tunnel) by Bernhard Kellermann, a novel from 1913. So for the backers who purchase one of the further tiers, this would be the second novel you will receive. I do not know when it, or any other novel, will be completely translated and delivered.As for the other three novels, I have not discovered them yet. They will be Sci-Fi novels (unless I can find a public domain novel that's not Sci-Fi that is so completely awesome I have to translate it and share it with all of you backers). I plan on using some of the funds gained from this campaign to obtain the other books written by Robert Heymann (the guy who wrote The Red Comet), as well as seeking other books worthy of being translated.If any backers out there has any suggestions, please, don't hesitate to let me know. The only stipulations on the books have to be:1. They have to be German.2. They have to be public domain (published before 1923).3. Never before translated to English.4. Easily findable (if you have the book in a digital format, let me know, or if you know where a hard copy can be found easily).So there we have it. If there are any questions, let me know.As I find new novels, I intend on making it known to the backers that I've found a new book and I will send the backers an email detailing a few details about the book.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>I
am currently a writer, indie publisher and avid reader. I grew up in the Rocky
Mountains of Colorado and a little over a year ago exchanged the Rockies for
the Andes. I spent the previous year writing and teaching English in my new
home in Medellin, Colombia. What I discovered in my classes is that my students
had very little knowledge of their own origins and history. That spawned an
idea for a historical novel series set during the Colombia’s fight for independence
from Spain. There is a secondary issue that I have in mind that is a second
reason for my project. Less than 5% of Colombians are regular readers. They are
able to read, but simply do not do so. To me, this is a tragedy. My books are
intentionally in a short (100 page), format (only about ¼” thick), so that they
will be less intimidating to new readers. My project is to pay for print
publishing costs of 500 books of each of the two titles to be distributed in
and around Medellin and Bogotá at book fairs and other events connected with
literacy and encouraging reading. This is the first step toward the ultimate
goal of having all six books in the series complete, along with another
historical novel based on the life of General Jose Maria Cordoba, by 2019 when
Colombia celebrates her Bicentennial.</p>

of multiple novels, novellas, and short stories, including: <i>Bay’s End, Life After Dane, </i>and, most
recently, the serial novel<i> Cruelty</i>,
which is why we’re here today.Everything’s
been going really well on the <i>Cruelty</i>
homefront. As of right now, the series is up to episode five of ten. You can purchase
these on Amazon in individual installments (all for $0.99) or altogether in the omnibus
edition, <i>Cruelty: Episodes One – Five </i>(for the discounted price of $3.99)<i>. </i>The
final five episodes are complete and awaiting editing. And therein lies the
problem.</p>
<p>On July 1, 2014, I presented to the hospital with right leg
paralysis, as well as bowel <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">and</span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""> </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">bladder</span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""> </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">incontinence.

ended up not saving him, and I was forever ruined for a job I truly loved to do. Doctors

with Coastal Neurological Institute in Mobile, Alabama, did a decompression wherein he removed a mass of

(that’s the oil found in hot peppers that give them their heat; its also a
natural anti-inflammatory drug). Fast forward to July 1, 2014, and me in the
emergency room, once again paralyzed on the right side from the waist down.
This was my fourth surgery for the same issue. My previous three operations (all hemi-laminectomy discectomies of L5 at S1) were in May 2005, July 2008, and June of 2011. Yep, that’s every three years,
almost to the month. Fun times were had by all. The sarcasm drips from the page...</span></p>
<p>So, how can you help me? Well, first, you need to know that
I’m what the publishing industry calls a “hybrid author.” Meaning, I’m self-published
as well as traditionally published (Red Adept Publishing is responsible for the
publication of <i>Life After Dane, Hope for
the Wicked, </i>and<i> Dastardly Bastard</i>).
<i>Cruelty</i> is one of my independent releases,
and although the serial sells rather well, nothing creates revenue as well as a
new release. I have plenty of money for me and my family to live on, but I had
to use my publishing budget (all five grand of it) to pay for in-patient physical therapy, some
rather outrageously-overpriced pain medicine, and odd electronic treatments. In summation, I don’t have enough
left over in my budget to pay for editing and proofreading, two things that are aboslutely mandatory in my eyes. Secondly, you should know that <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">royalties from my published works is </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">my </span><i style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">only</i><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""> source of income.

My fans have been good to me, and they deserve to know how
this story ends. So I come to you today to ask you—</span><i style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">beg you</i><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">, really—to help fund the publication of </span><i style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">A Final Act of Cruelty</i><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">.</span></p>
<p>I’m available to answer any and all questions you have. I am
also willing to offer free copies of <i>Cruelty:
Episode One</i> to anyone who requests one, but the series doesn’t really hit
its stride until <i>Episode Three</i>. In
other words, the first episode, while essential to the plot, is not the episode
I would judge the entire series on. The rabbit hole goes much, <i>much</i> deeper.</p>
<p>Please, do not
hesitate to contact me with any questions and concerns you might have. Hopefully, together, we can
see the end of <i>Cruelty.</i> </p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Project REDSOKS is a 17-year old Fine Art Nude Photo project dedicated to Gia Carangi(former supermodel) 1960-1986 who inspires us.</p>
<p>The purpose of this project is to use strength in nudity from women to raise attention,eyebrows,awareness,in any way we can to get people to TALK about HIV/Aids in a positive way.</p>
<p>RED being the color we use to represent AIDS and the nudity we use in a NON-sexual way and a show of strength that women have even when you would THINK they would be vulnerable...naked except for SOKS.</p>

<h3>Print Books Are Shipping and Shipping Budgets: Updated August 3, 2015</h3>
<div>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The print shipments of <i>The Incredible Untold Story of Sailor Moon</i> began approximately a month ago and are continuing gradually.  We are contending with a budgeting issue as domestic shipping via UPS and USPS is running 200% to 300% more expensive than we budgeted.   For example, the last two books we shipped ran an average of more than </span><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">$21.00</span><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> each.  The crowdfunding campaign budgeted $5 for shipping.   This means we're facing an overall shortfall of </span><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">at least $1500</span><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">.  </span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Funds to cover those additional costs are being pulled from other Palace in the Sky projects, which has delayed shipping past our target dates.</span></p>
<p>We sent an e-mail to everyone who participated in the crowdfunding campaign and numerous customers from our bookstore asking if anyone would be willing to help us offset the additional costs, but we only received one reply.</p>
<p>At this point all we can do is work our way through it.  If your book has not yet arrived, rest assured we are working as hard as we can to deliver it as soon as possible.</p>
</div>

<h3>Shipping Confirmations Update June 12, 2015<br/>
</h3>
<p>If you ordered a PRINT book or were awarded one as part of a perk, please check your e-mail for your shipping address confirmation and respond if your address is out of date.  For further details, please visit @sailrmoonuntold on Twitter and <a href=""http://sablewolf.net/moongame"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://sablewolf.net/moongame</a> <br/></p>
<h3>Short Summary</h3> <p></p>
<p>My name is Theodore Jefferson.  I am an author, journalist, and a 
former marketing consultant for DIC Entertainment.  Myself and my 
editor, Larissa Kayne, have been considering writing a nonfiction book 
about Sailor Moon for some time.
</p>
<p>I have been studying the Sailor Moon phenomenon for over fifteen 
years.  I believe there is much more to the characters, its creator, the
 show and the manga series than most people believe, whether they work 
in the entertainment business or not.  
</p>
<p>I plan to explain to my readers why this show has been overlooked, 
and why at the same time it may very well have been the foundation upon 
which a fifty billion dollar animation legacy rests.
</p>
<p>After the characters' 20th anniversary and the release of the new 
anime series, we think it's time the unbelievable true story of Sailor Moon's journey from Japan to the United States was told.
</p>
<p>Contributions to this book project will help us meet and interview 
the people who worked to bring this world-famous television series to 
English-speaking audiences, and let you hear their story in their words.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p>The primary expense for this project is the cost of interviews.  Each
 interview requires many hours of preparation and coordination.  All 
will need to be transcribed.  Some will need to be translated.  Some may
 require travel.  All of the material will need to be written in a 
manner that makes it informative and entertaining.</p>
<p>Our perks are unique and exciting!  All our contributors get their 
name in the book and can suggest a question for our interviewees.  Some 
can reserve the ebook.  Some can get the print version.  Higher level 
contributions can be credited as Associate Editors and recommend 
interviewees.  
</p>
<p>We also have a series of one-time perks for those who wish to join our Pantheon of Heroes and claim featured pages!  The
 base goal will give us what we need to do three interviews.  We will 
launch a stretch goal for each additional interview.  We also plan an 
audiobook combination stretch goal and perk after the print and ebook 
version goals are reached.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<h3><b>Stretch Goals:<br/></b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>If we reach $4000, we will make an audiobook version.  Perks for the audiobook will be added after we reach $2000.<br/></p>
<p>The book begins with three interviews.  For every $500 donated after the $2000 goal, we will add a bonus interview.</p>

</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>Sailor Moon changed the world.  There is no doubt about that.  
Many of her fans are not aware of just how important their favorite 
character was 20 years ago and how important she is today.  
</p>
<p>This book will connect the dots in ways that will inspire you.  No 
matter how devoted a fan you are, this book will teach you things you 
don't know about Sailor Moon.  Everyone who reads our book will be 
surprised by just how influential this animated series really is.  I've
 written numerous books, and many of them have had considerable 
success.  None of them have provided me this volume of research.  I have a
 truly immense selection of information sources for this project. I'm 
really looking forward to putting what I know into words.  I think 
you'll agree it was worth our shared effort. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>There is little risk the book won't get written if we only reach a

 is totally dependent on reaching our goal and hopefully exceeding it!<br/><br/>Some

project succeed, please make as much noise about us as you can.  Find

</div></div>","Print Books Are Shipping and Shipping Budgets: Updated August 3, 2015

The print shipments of The Incredible Untold Story of Sailor Moon began approximately a month ago and are continuing gradually.  We are contending with a budgeting issue as domestic shipping via UPS and USPS is running 200% to 300% more expensive than we budgeted.   For example, the last two books we shipped ran an average of more than $21.00 each.  The crowdfunding campaign budgeted $5 for shipping.   This means we're facing an overall shortfall of at least $1500.  


Funds to cover those additional costs are being pulled from other Palace in the Sky projects, which has delayed shipping past our target dates.
We sent an e-mail to everyone who participated in the crowdfunding campaign and numerous customers from our bookstore asking if anyone would be willing to help us offset the additional costs, but we only received one reply.
At this point all we can do is work our way through it.  If your book has not yet arrived, rest assured we are working as hard as we can to deliver it as soon as possible.

We are still sending address confirmations and you will also receive an e-mail immediately after your book ships.


Please note the sablewolf.net domain has been shut down in lieu of a possible future publishing project to be announced.  Visit @sailrmoonuntold on Twitter or http://ladystar.net for the latest news.

<p>Like most epiphanies, the idea for this zine became clear after countless midnight conversation and years of going around and around in circles around the heart of the issue: what does family really look like?</p>
<p>We've all seen the images of family put forth by western media: solidly middle class, married heterosexual parents, 2.5 kids, loving by sternly moral. For those of us growing up in abusive families, we had to wonder: are we the only ones carrying this pain? For those of us growing up in cultures and traditions not represented by western television, we wondered: are we the only ones not conforming to this structure? For those of us coping with death, abandonment, deportation, or incarceration of a family member, we wondered: are we the only ones being told our family as it exists is not whole? For those of us starting from scratch in adulthood to build our own chosen family, we wondered: are we the only ones struggling to redefine family?</p>
<p>This zine includes submissions from all over the country and the world exploring the concepts of home through essays, poetry, comics, and art.

<p><b>ABOUT ME:</b> I’m Leonardo--a truth and love seeking passionate book lover. My book “We Can Lift Each Other Up, Higher and Higher” is a collection—one page for each day of the year-- of beautiful thoughts, poems, songs, stories, inspiration, affirmations, humor, profound observations, and healing techniques garnered from saints, seers, mystics, radicals, and sages.</p>
<p>When I realized in my twenties (now 72) that I was asleep, with little understanding of love, truth, or consciousness, my goal became to awaken and be truly alive which involved learning to be present, uncovering essence, understanding my unconscious and dealing with negative emotions. I had a lot to learn and am still learning and what I’ve learned is to keep learning. </p>
<p>Have had several occupations: movie theater owner, newspaper publisher, restaurant, construction, painting, Limousine, taxi. Blessed with four children: Crystal, Bliss, Adam, Hope; two grandchildren: Madeline, Liam; great friends most notably Beriah Wall.</p>
<p>As I waltzed through these various incarnations, I kept a journal and read in pursuit of love and truth, always noting what I found interesting, inspiring, enlightening.</p>
<p>Eventually realized there is a light within all of us to which we can connect with persistent study.</p>
<p>We’re in the midst of a global awakening provoking an inner movement transforming the world in a positive direction.  Your support will help you and others to discover the wonders awaiting us if we persist in our search for love and truth. One of the prerequisites of accessing higher spiritual planes is to assist others to rise. Together we can lift each other up higher and higher. </p>

<br/>
<p><b>PURPOSE: </b>My book will help open doors within, put a smile of understanding on your face and touch your heart to help you transform into a being of pure light that can serve all living creatures simultaneously and eternally.</p>

<p><b>IMAGINE </b>as John Lennon said and give peace and love a chance. Get on the love train—let’s have a love revolution. Together we can lift each other up higher and higher.</p>
<p>Since I don’t have a recognizable name, it’s been difficult finding a publisher. With a well-known name attached, publishers would be excited about “We Can Lift Each Other Up, Higher and Higher.” When published, sales will be strong, because there are many out there who realize we are on the brink of a new world where people join together and open their minds and hearts and foster unity in contrast to the evil forces of separation that scare us, divide us and start one war after another. </p>

<p>A major publisher—RedWheel+Weiser+Conari will publish “We Can Lift Each Other Up, Higher and Higher” for  $7,500. They will put it in their catalog, on Amazon, etc. If it sells 2,500 copies they will give me a book contract or I could go with Hay House for about the same money.</p>

My book “We Can Lift Each Other Up, Higher and Higher” is a collection—one page for each day of the year-- of beautiful thoughts, poems, songs, stories, inspiration, affirmations, humor, profound observations, and healing techniques garnered from saints, seers, mystics, radicals, and sages.
When I realized in my twenties (now 72) that I was asleep, with little understanding of love, truth, or consciousness, my goal became to awaken and be truly alive which involved learning to be present, uncovering essence, understanding my unconscious and dealing with negative emotions. I had a lot to learn and am still learning and what I’ve learned is to keep learning. 
Have had several occupations: movie theater owner, newspaper publisher, restaurant, construction, painting, Limousine, taxi. Blessed with four children: Crystal, Bliss, Adam, Hope; two grandchildren: Madeline, Liam; great friends most notably Beriah Wall.
As I waltzed through these various incarnations, I kept a journal and read in pursuit of love and truth, always noting what I found interesting, inspiring, enlightening.
Eventually realized there is a light within all of us to which we can connect with persistent study.
We’re in the midst of a global awakening provoking an inner movement transforming the world in a positive direction.  Your support will help you and others to discover the wonders awaiting us if we persist in our search for love and truth. One of the prerequisites of accessing higher spiritual planes is to assist others to rise. Together we can lift each other up higher and higher. 

Embroidered Peace Hat

PURPOSE: My book will help open doors within, put a smile of understanding on your face and touch your heart to help you transform into a being of pure light that can serve all living creatures simultaneously and eternally.
We’re all in this together. We are one. We’re all brothers and sisters. With the love of the Universe, I dedicate and share with you thoughts and words that will bring love, peace, harmony, and help you experience the joy of living on the path toward unconditional love.

The story is inspired by novelist Kurt Vonnegut and Canadian poets Michael Turner (Hardcore Logo) and Michael Ondaatje. The story is told as a narrative poem by a Bard 0710, an incorporeal bardic bureaucrat, in other works, he is a spirit who's day job consists of studying a species' experiences and filling away those experiences in this Bardic Institution. Bard 0710 was assigned to capture Llewelyn's story from his near death experience in an office building to his Northern escapade in search of supernatural powers until his return to an empty city with no signs as to what happened or where everyone went.I am in need of a month of working time to finish writing and editing, and produce a hard copy. I am setting the funding goal at $3,000. If funding is successful the books will be available to the public by October/November 2014. If the funding is not successful the backers will still receive a copy of the book once it is finished but will have to wait until Winter 2014.   TL;DR: give me money and read a sweet book!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p><span>Odd One Out magazine hones in on the normal, everyday people and their stories. Stories that rarely get heard or written. </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">In each issue we focus on the contemporary generation whose uniqueness reflects the joy and colour that comes from living in Malaysia. We explore the line between foreign and familiar, and discover from each person to the next, how much of their journey feels relatable and familiar, or foreign and inaccessible to us as a reader. </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">This is how powerful storytelling can be, to be able to cut through pre-conceived notion perpetuated from abstractions or a single loose statement. There’s more than just a single story to a person or a place. Malaysia itself is a country beyond the beautiful sand and beaches, with many untold narratives by its people. Each Malaysian individual is nuanced and are compelling characters in their own right and these are their stories.</span></p>
<p>This is what Odd One Out is truly about: placing people who are the heart and soul of our lives in the spotlight. We hope to shift perceptions and make people realize that there’s more than meets the eye and that stories are often comprised of several beautiful shades of multicoloured layers. </p>
