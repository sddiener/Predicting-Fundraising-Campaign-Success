<p>Coming to terms of her younger sister, Maya’s terminal cancer has always been difficult for Serena Gonzalez.

The sisters share a bond like no other which makes it difficult for Serena to accept Maya’s fate.</p>

<p><strong><i>So Long and Good Night</i></strong> is a film that conveys a young Cuban American woman, Serena Gonzalez’s fight with her own mental illness while trying to come to terms with her younger sister, Maya Gonzalez’s, terminal cancer.</p>
<p>This story is very personal to me because similar to the sister’s relationship’s my sister and I are extremely close, and we share a bond like no other. Like our protagonist, I too have mental illness and I want to share light on how discussing having <u>anxiety and functioning depression</u> should be discussed more in media and even amongst friends and your community.</p>
<p> In my experiences whenever my mental health issues are brought to light, I’m quickly looked at differently or stigmatized whenever I’m facing personal issues and that shouldn’t be the case. People who have mental illness should feel open and free when discussing their mental health illness and my hope with my thesis is to have more open conversations about people’s mental health.</p>
<p>I have a multicultural background of Italian descent (from my father’s side) and Cuban descent (from my mother’s side). This film heavily focuses on my Cuban roots, mostly due to my abuelita, <u><i><strong>Hipolita ‘Pola’ Gonzalez</strong></i></u> always being a constant in my life. She was living with my parents since I was in middle school and was always getting herself into the good kind of trouble. She was fierce, loved, extremely independent and a kick ass Latina. Sadly, she passed last year and now my thesis film will be dedicated to her.</p>

</div></div>","Coming to terms of her younger sister, Maya’s terminal cancer has always been difficult for Serena Gonzalez. She struggles with her own mental health issues and relies on her bond with Maya to help through those struggles. The sisters share a bond like no other which makes it difficult for Serena to accept Maya’s fate.
Written and Produced by Anna Carina Scalzi, So Long and Good Night, explores the sisterly bond that Serena and Maya Gonzalez have as Serena tries to come to terms with Maya’s terminal cancer.
 

So Long and Good Night is a film that conveys a young Cuban American woman, Serena Gonzalez’s fight with her own mental illness while trying to come to terms with her younger sister, Maya Gonzalez’s, terminal cancer.
This story is very personal to me because similar to the sister’s relationship’s my sister and I are extremely close, and we share a bond like no other. Like our protagonist, I too have mental illness and I want to share light on how discussing having anxiety and functioning depression should be discussed more in media and even amongst friends and your community.
 In my experiences whenever my mental health issues are brought to light, I’m quickly looked at differently or stigmatized whenever I’m facing personal issues and that shouldn’t be the case. People who have mental illness should feel open and free when discussing their mental health illness and my hope with my thesis is to have more open conversations about people’s mental health.
I have a multicultural background of Italian descent (from my father’s side) and Cuban descent (from my mother’s side). This film heavily focuses on my Cuban roots, mostly due to my abuelita, Hipolita ‘Pola’ Gonzalez always being a constant in my life. She was living with my parents since I was in middle school and was always getting herself into the good kind of trouble. She was fierce, loved, extremely independent and a kick ass Latina. Sadly, she passed last year and now my thesis film will be dedicated to her.

Thanks for asking! </p><p>Mental health is a huge part of this project. After a year of social distancing and loneliness, the symptoms of anxiety disorder and depressive disorder increased considerably (according to CDC.gov). Talking about mental health is extremely important to break the stigma around this topic, especially nowadays.

Parlare di salute mentale è estremamente importante per rompere lo stigma intorno a questo argomento, soprattutto oggi. Molte persone evitano di parlare di problemi di salute mentale per paura di dover affrontare discriminazioni dalla società. Mantenere le discussioni sulla salute mentale farà sentire a loro agio queste persone così che possano riconoscere quando hanno bisogno di aiuto: questo è il nostro obiettivo.</p><p>Il nostro team si è incontrato online durante le nostre infinite lezioni su zoom. Abbiamo visto in prima persona (e provato sulla nostra pelle) le difficoltà dei nostri compagni di classe, professori, familiari e amici e l'unico strumento che avevamo per aiutarli era parlare al computer o al telefono. Il lato incredibile di questa tragica esperienza è che ha creato un legame incredibile tra di noi, e ora siamo entusiasti di lavorare nel nostro primo progetto insieme!

Thanks for asking! Mental health is a huge part of this project. After a year of social distancing and loneliness, the symptoms of anxiety disorder and depressive disorder increased considerably (according to CDC.gov). Talking about mental health is extremely important to break the stigma around this topic, especially nowadays. Some of us might avoid talking about mental health problems if we’re worried about facing discrimination from society. Keeping discussions going about mental health likely makes us feel comfortable enough to recognize when we need help - our goal is to make people feel comfortable to discuss about this topic and to ask for help.Our team met online during our endless zoom classes. We saw first hand our classmates, professors, family, and friends struggling (and we felt in that way too) - the only tool we had to help them was to talk over a computer or a phone. The amazing side of this tragic experience is that it created an incredible bound between us, and now we're excited to work on the first project together! The deep understanding of this topic in addition to the respect and love that we have for each other's are the perfect combination for a successful short film.[ITA] Questa è un'ottima domanda! Grazie per averlo chiesto!La salute mentale è una parte importante di questo progetto. Dopo un anno di distanziamento sociale e solitudine, ansia e depressione sono aumentati considerevolmente (secondo CDC.gov). Parlare di salute mentale è estremamente importante per rompere lo stigma intorno a questo argomento, soprattutto oggi. Molte persone evitano di parlare di problemi di salute mentale per paura di dover affrontare discriminazioni dalla società. Mantenere le discussioni sulla salute mentale farà sentire a loro agio queste persone così che possano riconoscere quando hanno bisogno di aiuto: questo è il nostro obiettivo.Il nostro team si è incontrato online durante le nostre infinite lezioni su zoom. Abbiamo visto in prima persona (e provato sulla nostra pelle) le difficoltà dei nostri compagni di classe, professori, familiari e amici e l'unico strumento che avevamo per aiutarli era parlare al computer o al telefono. Il lato incredibile di questa tragica esperienza è che ha creato un legame incredibile tra di noi, e ora siamo entusiasti di lavorare nel nostro primo progetto insieme! La profonda comprensione di questo argomento, oltre al rispetto e all'amore che abbiamo gli uni per gli altri, sono la combinazione perfetta per un cortometraggio di successo.[ENG] Cissy Wellman has starred in several films and TV shows over the course of her long career. Wellman's father was the author of the first Academy Award Best Motion Picture Film Wings (1927) and A Star is Born (1937).She's thrilled to play the part of Denise and looks forward to creating a well-rounded character who may seem stiff at first, but is later discovered to have genuine love in her heart. [ITA] Cissy Wellman ha recitato in diversi film e programmi TV nel corso della sua lunga carriera.

We're planning to film a sequence underwater, which requires insurance for our rented camera equipment, actors, and our cinematographer. The underwater sequence alone will be one of our biggest challenges as a production, but the scene is integral to the story and we're committed to executing it safely and effectively. [ITA] La cinematografia è uno degli aspetti più importanti del nostro film e lo sviluppo della portata visiva del film è uno dei nostri maggiori ostacoli quando si tratta del nostro budget. Abbiamo in programma di filmare una sequenza sott'acqua, che richiede un'assicurazione per la nostra attrezzatura per la macchina da presa noleggiata, gli attori e il nostro direttore della fotografia. La sequenza subacquea da sola sarà una delle nostre maggiori sfide come produzione, ma la scena è parte integrante della storia e ci impegniamo a eseguirla in modo sicuro ed efficace.[ENG] Well, let's say that making a $30,000 movie when we're still trying to pay out student loans is hard as f*ck.  So we need your help to cover these  expenses (or maybe someone at Warner Bros who decides to finance us, both could work):[ITA] Bene, diciamo che fare un film da $ 30.000 quando stiamo ancora cercando di pagare i finanziamenti scolastici è dura. Quindi abbiamo bisogno del tuo aiuto per coprire queste spese (o magari per trovare qualcuno alla Warner Bros che decida di finanziarci): [ENG] If like me, math isn't your thang, here's an explanation of that colorful pie:We’re raising funds a 10 pages short script, which we’ll begin shortly after we close our campaign art the end of September. The majority of our budget is going towards equipment, crew, cast, locations, etc. We'll use around $22,500 for production, $9,000 of which will cover the Camera Department costs, $6,600 to pay the rent of our location, $4,500 to buy and rent props, costumes and set design to make the movie come to life, $2,400 will go towards our brilliant actors and SAG-AFTRA fees. $4,500 will cover out Covid Costs to ensure we’re keeping our cast and crew safe. Lastly, $3,000 will go towards our post-production, which includes music, sound mixing, color grading, and editing. Funny how a good chunk of cash turns out to be a pretty tight budget once you break it all down, huh? Yeah, making a movie is not as cheap as it seems... at least if you want to make it right! And we want to make it perfect to rack up all those awards! Awards? Oh yeah, we're already  strategizing on festival run and looking at some awesome platforms to deliver our short film right into your screens! Isn't this cool?[ITA] Se come me, la matematica non fa per te, ecco una spiegazione di quella torta colorata:Stiamo raccogliendo fondi per un breve copione di 10 pagine, che inizieremo poco dopo la chiusura della grafica della campagna alla fine di settembre. La maggior parte del nostro budget è destinata a attrezzature, troupe, cast, location e così via.Useremo circa $ 22.500 per la produzione, $ 9.000 dei quali copriranno i costi del reparto riprese, $ 6.600 per pagare l'affitto della nostra location, $ 4.500 per acquistare e noleggiare oggetti di scena, costumi e scenografia per dare vita al film, $ 2.400 andranno verso i nostri brillanti attori e le commissioni SAG-AFTRA. $ 4.500 copriranno i costi di Covid per garantire la sicurezza del cast e della troupe. Infine, $ 3.000 andranno alla nostra post-produzione, che include musica, mixaggio del suono, correzione del colore e editing.

<h3>Hi!</h3>
<p><i>Thanks you so much for stopping in. We are so excited to be making our debut short film: The Coin.  The Coin will be the official b-side story to our up and coming feature length film of The Son.  </i></p>
<h2><strong>The Coin</strong></h2>
<p>The Coin is a film about A 17 year old teenager whose world turns upside down from the recent death of her mother. She finds herself trapped, locked within this feeling of being worthless due to her abusive step-father.    She places her hope, value and protection within a rare coin given to her by her mom.  </p>
<h2><strong>Inspiration</strong></h2>
<p>The script is inspired by God and it was written for those struggling with depression, struggling with self worth and someone that has been in this situation.  Whoever you are, you are beautiful, valuable and worth more than the rarest gemstone that you could find on this earth.  I</p>
<p>Let's face the facts, there are so many that can relate to this message being spoken about.  We are here to create and tell unique stories inspired by scripture but told in a relatable way.  The Coin takes an approach to really dive deep into our protagonist’s back story.  We will be able to get a glimpse of who this character is, and what the feature film will be like.  </p>
<p>A lot of things have lined up perfectly for this new season to happen and we are STOKED to get on with the program here!!!</p>
<p>We wrote ""The Son"" as a short film for Luke's school and at first it was just a tick in a box to satisfy his grade, but now it has grown much larger heights than we could ever imagine! We are soooo ready for these things to be done, but we know with great patience, hard work, and a whole lotta Jesus anything is possible!! </p>
<p>We feel this script could impact so many lives in it's 100's of inspirational messages and to further that need for this film, we feel shooting smaller films or ""B sides"" of the story will help get the word out and get people excited about it. Thats where funding the film ""The Coin"" would come into play for our feature ""The Son"" . </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><i>The world needs good</i>.</p>
<p>It needs inspiration. Too many times today the ""good hearted' films are too picture perfect. They don't show the real life struggles, they don't show the vulnerable people, or the hurting imperfect world.</p>
<p>But we want show the light in the real world darkness. The real.  We all need that. If you feel the same way, let's do this together!</p>
<h2><strong>Where your money will go</strong></h2>
<p>The main costs for indie film productions revolve around paying cast and crew, food, expenses, props, and others. We have put together a budget that best fits our production level and have calculated the rates of each working person along with the cost of specific things including locations, travel, gear and additional unexpected expenses.</p>
<p><strong>Here is a rough budget of what we are looking to spend:</strong></p>
<p>$900-$1100 for a 8-9 person crew</p>
<p>$750 for a 3 person cast</p>
<p>$100-200 for catering</p>
<p>$150. Props + Set Design</p>
<p>$500-800 Post Production</p>
<p>$200-300 Location</p>
<p>$500-800 Marketing</p>
<p><strong>$3100-$3500+</strong></p>
<p>Your money isn't just going to get eaten up and spit out though. We want you to feel like your investment was worth it. Each ""perk"" involves and special thank you on the final film and they get more and more exciting the more you give.  We are working hard behind the scenes because we truly want to release a film that will touch that one life who needs this message the most.  With that we are excited to release our film's official line of merchandise.  You can check out many cool designs on our production website at <a href=""http://www.filmtheson.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.filmtheson.com. </a><strong>  </strong></p>

<h2><strong>The Road Ahead</strong></h2>
<p><strong>What is the future of this short film?</strong></p>
<p>The main idea in mind for this short film is for marketing purposes for the larger 1.5 million dollar film. We know Rome wasn't built in a day, and if everyone with a good movie idea got funded without marketing, we would all do it. That's why this short film is so important because this film is just the start of many more beautiful things coming. </p>
<p>Marketing is the literal heartbeat of every successful movie and we feel we are on the right track toward a solid foundation of a feature length film by exploring character development within the shorts. </p>
<p><strong>What is the next step to produce ""The Son""?</strong></p>
<p>Just like The Coin, we need coins to fund our bigger ventures. Small but mighty steps have been made in the right direction for production of the larger film. We are currently projecting production to begin in February of 2022. Pre-production is in process including revising the script, paperwork, planning, location scouting and more.</p>

<h2><u><i>Short Summary</i></u></h2>
<p>Hello, we are Jak Ivings and Amina Williams and we are two film-making students from Bristol, who want to create a not-for-profit film that doesn't look studenty. We also really want to pay creatives respect for working on our film, hence we need your help to make that possible.</p>
<p>Our passion lies in dark story telling, which we think deserves more exposure than it gets. For example, this particular film includes quite a bit of violence, surrounding an abusive father and husband.</p>
<p>This is a behind the scenes photo on day 2 of the prototype. Jak is on the far right.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1629825696/rxif3yzt1gwroxnzagwi.png"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<p>Jak is a sound connoisseur. He particularly loves foley [sound effects], so he is one to pay close attention to it on set and particularly in post-production. Jak has always loved psychological and horror films from a young age and is excited to make his own of a similar genre, this one technically being a psychological thriller.</p>
<p>Amina loves to dive into a bit of everything from camera operating to producing. She started off acting in a few short films and knows how to communicate with actors, as she has often times been on the same end of the production. Her acting debut in <i><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyB2lRTA634"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Window</a>, </i>a production of <i>CineUltra, </i>has won multiple awards at several online festivals.</p>
<p><u><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1629856696/jiipbfr4kbekqabeonvp.jpg"" src=""""/></i></u></p>
<h2><u><i>What We Need &amp; What You Get</i></u></h2>
<ol>
<li>First and foremost, your contribution will go towards paying our actors their national living/minumum wage they would earn on a day job of 8 hours + their travel expenses. This is one of the key reasons we have launched this campaign, as we believe paying our actors is the best way to show respect for their time.</li>
<li>Travel expenses for our crew (no matter how small).</li>
<li>Snacks and food supplies for catering.</li>
</ol>
<p>We hope to crowdfund £1,500 to make sure we can cover everything we have planned to cover and anything that comes up as an emergency (if something on set breaks etc.). Even if we do not reach our goal, the funds collected will still primarily go to our actors.</p>
<p>As it is the standard for perks, we would like to offer a special thanks in the credits or with a handwritten letter, invite you to our screening of the film or last but not least, provide you with a digital copy of the film. We, ofcourse, can never repay you for your generous donations however, you'll be the reason why the film even goes into production!</p>
</div><div>
<h2><u><i>The Impact</i></u></h2>
<ul>
<li>We have made a prototype (which you can find above to watch with two separate scenes) but are determined to make a full version of the script. This will boost our confidence and launch us from the realm of STUDENT to PROFESSIONAL film-making.</li>
<li>This film is for all the dark cinema lovers out there, who love a few chills running down their spine when <i>truly</i> immersed in something engaging and powerful.</li>
<li>We are aware that it takes a <strong>bold</strong> move to explore dark themes as young and upcoming filmmakers but we trust ourselves to break the stereotype and hope we can gain that trust in our backers too!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h2><u><i>Challenges</i></u></h2>

<p>Thank you all so much,</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Hello, we are Jak Ivings and Amina Williams and we are two film-making students from Bristol, who want to create a not-for-profit film that doesn't look studenty. We also really want to pay creatives respect for working on our film, hence we need your help to make that possible.
Our passion lies in dark story telling, which we think deserves more exposure than it gets. For example, this particular film includes quite a bit of violence, surrounding an abusive father and husband.
This is a behind the scenes photo on day 2 of the prototype. Jak is on the far right.


Jak is a sound connoisseur. He particularly loves foley [sound effects], so he is one to pay close attention to it on set and particularly in post-production. Jak has always loved psychological and horror films from a young age and is excited to make his own of a similar genre, this one technically being a psychological thriller.
Amina loves to dive into a bit of everything from camera operating to producing. She started off acting in a few short films and knows how to communicate with actors, as she has often times been on the same end of the production. Her acting debut in Window, a production of CineUltra, has won multiple awards at several online festivals.

What We Need & What You Get

First and foremost, your contribution will go towards paying our actors their national living/minumum wage they would earn on a day job of 8 hours + their travel expenses. This is one of the key reasons we have launched this campaign, as we believe paying our actors is the best way to show respect for their time.
Travel expenses for our crew (no matter how small).
Snacks and food supplies for catering.

We hope to crowdfund £1,500 to make sure we can cover everything we have planned to cover and anything that comes up as an emergency (if something on set breaks etc.). Even if we do not reach our goal, the funds collected will still primarily go to our actors.
As it is the standard for perks, we would like to offer a special thanks in the credits or with a handwritten letter, invite you to our screening of the film or last but not least, provide you with a digital copy of the film. We, ofcourse, can never repay you for your generous donations however, you'll be the reason why the film even goes into production!

The Impact

We have made a prototype (which you can find above to watch with two separate scenes) but are determined to make a full version of the script. This will boost our confidence and launch us from the realm of STUDENT to PROFESSIONAL film-making.
This film is for all the dark cinema lovers out there, who love a few chills running down their spine when truly immersed in something engaging and powerful.
We are aware that it takes a bold move to explore dark themes as young and upcoming filmmakers but we trust ourselves to break the stereotype and hope we can gain that trust in our backers too!


Challenges
Our biggest challenge really, is being professional. For us, this means being respectful towards our actors and paying any travel expenses for crew that have to travel a distance. It is the biggest project we have worked on so far and we'd like to run it as smoothly as possible.
We've been very patient with waiting for the right moment to restart filming as several obstacles, including lock downs, have obstructed along the way. After everything that has taken place, we are still determined to make a great film.
We believe that the key to film-making is to keep prototyping, refurbishing, re-making. However, the challenge is almost always to not give up on a project and deliver a finished product no matter the length and energy it takes.

<p>Hi movie lover!</p> <p>Help us finish our great new film and you'll be an essential part of BC movie magic.</p> <p>We’re almost finished making Outrunners, a hilariously smart comedy filmed in beautiful BC. Outrunners is a smart comedy about two bickering reality stars, Emily and Todd, who are racing to save Emily’s mom’s life during a future pandemic while chased by deadly snipers + camera drones. We just need 25K to add music, audio, and visual effects!</p> <p><strong>My passion for this movie</strong></p>
<p>I’m the writer/director, Ken Hegan. I’ve been a writer for Rolling Stone and 20 TV shows, written/directed 11 short films, and you can see <a href=""https://youtu.be/S2XaMjMhAfg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">my brewery sitcom trailer here</a>. I believe you should make the films you want to see...and I really want to see this movie. I’ve directed the story with care and passion, collaborated with pro actors and crew, and filmed in locations so gorgeous, you’ll think we filmed it all over the world.</p> <p><strong>Watch our trailer!</strong></p> <p>Here’s our <a href=""https://youtu.be/fJk2yj0xL1w"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">fun pitch video</a> and website: <a href=""https://www.outrunnersfilm.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">outrunnersfilm.com</a></p> <p><strong>The timely plot</strong></p>
<p>During a future pandemic lockdown, a determined young woman, Emily, races to save her mother while dodging snipers and reality show camera drones. Inspired by the cancellation of Big Brother Germany while the castmates were live on air, Outrunners is a pandemic comedy thriller that’s like Game Night meets The Hunger Games. </p> <p>Important note: our story takes place 18 months after the end of COVID-19. It’s a smart, hopeful, pro-mask, pro-vaccination, pro-comedy film that’s full of heart and love and adventure.</p> <p><strong>How this movie started</strong></p>
<p>I came up with the idea on Week 1 of the COVID-19 pandemic when I was racing to hunker down with my mom in Kamloops. So I started mapping out 40 great adventure scenes.</p> <p><strong>How we made it</strong></p>
<p>Once I banged out the smart and funny script, I surrounded myself with talented actors (you’ll love <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4323389/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Amanda McEwan</a> as Emily and <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3716343/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Matt Graham</a> as Todd), crew, and cinematographers <a href=""https://www.transmutepictures.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Andy Brown and Marco Bossow</a>. </p> <p>Our veteran producer &amp; production designer is Shawn ‘Major’ Major, our Executive Producers are Wendy Hyman of Big Sky Pictures and Corinne Lea the CEO &amp; Boss Babe of <a href=""http://riotheatre.ca/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Rio Theatre.</a> Check <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14384360/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">our full cast and crew list</a>. </p> <p><strong>Our sponsors and cameos</strong></p>
<p>Outrunners was entirely filmed (safely) during COVID-19. After filming two weeks in Kamloops (thanks <a href=""https://www.tourismkamloops.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tourism Kamloops</a>!), we filmed our epic ending at this <a href=""https://www.lynnwoodmarina.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">cool marina</a> in North Vancouver.</p>
<p>We shot the reality show games &amp; hot tub scenes on a Delta farm owned by skateboarding legend Kevin Harris (check out his <a href=""https://www.kombuchababy.ca/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Kombucha Baby</a> beverages).</p>

There tends to be a shaming of online communities and virtual interaction and in starting conversations about fanfics, we found that the general perception of the community was all wrong.This documentary aims to widen the understanding of the fanfic community, not only within itself but enlighten non-fanfic readers about the wonderful world that has evolved into a diverse and unique medium.We’re a film crew that wants to provide an honest look into these communities and encourage the educational and positive properties of the medium. With mainstream media now reaching into the world of fanfics, it's important that we provide a platform for the community to represent themselves in their own words, amplified by research and analysis conducted into the world. We aim to interview a range of different voices: For those who’ve established a prolific writing career, did fanfiction help them, and how do the two worlds differ?Insight from those who write/read and their experiences in being the creators that keep these communities alive. As well as the connections they form with one another.Experts who have studied fanfiction as a whole, and researchers who can provide insights into how the different aspects operate.Help us clear up the air around fanfiction! Why Crowdfunding? The funding will go towards making sure that we can create the most authentic representation of the fanfiction world. We are based in London, so we will need to travel to contact those with a genuine interest in the community and get to know the people behind the screens. Your money will also ensure that every hour of labour from animators and composers are appropriately paid for as well as supporting the film crew throughout the shooting days.We will also need to acquire rights to certain materials that we need to tell the story without any copyright issues. Unique Challenges COVID-19Even as England is lifting its restrictions around COVID, we will be sure to take every precaution to ensure that our crew and contributors are safe. Copyright and permissionAs we delve into fanfiction, we must also delve into the world of legality and copyright as well. Of course, we will always ask for permission to showcase content and pay owners where necessary. UpdatesKeep an eye on this campaign as we'll have regular updates with information about our crew, our progress and potentially behind the scenes as well!  Spread the Word!

<p><strong>PROPS</strong></p>
<ul><li>Motorcycles are needed, we have many background motorcycles that will be provided, but we need more for the riding scenes.  </li></ul>
<p><strong>SET DESIGN</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Some locations we are seeking to film at for the NASA scenes, may not be available. If so we may have to build those sets instead for the NASA control room. </li>
<li>Some of the other scenes we will have to build platforms and sand delivered</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>EXPLOSIONS</strong></p>
<ul><li>We have used POST explosions in the past, but will be using real explosions for the end scene when the SCORPIONS raid Eugene's compound. We will be hiring a pyrotechnic for this scene. </li></ul>
<p><strong>LOCATIONS</strong></p>
<ul><li>Some locations will require special insurance and fee's to film at. This will help fund those locations that require a fee. </li></ul>
<p><strong>EQUIPMENT</strong></p>
<ul><li>For this film we will be seeking the highest quality possible for a INDIE-FILM, and will be utilizing higher end equipment. We will rent or pay a DP to film using ARRI or RED equipment and will incur a cost for this.</li></ul>

This was code-named, “Project Sun,” and was found in 2091 by former NASA Engineer named Eugene Patterson. Shortly after 2050 an asteroid struck the Earth and eliminated 70% of its population.

It is now controlled by a group of outlaws called, “Scorpions,” who have banished any intelligent work to commence on the planet Earth. Eugene Patterson has been in hiding since 2050 a former NASA engineer in attempt to find a solution to the world’s problem; what happens when the sun dies? In the midst of finding answers; he’s also attempting to find a cure for his dying son Earl who has a rare chromosome disease. Eugene will be put to the ultimate test while confronting the outlaws and making the ultimate decision. Do I save my son or do I save the SUN?

About Joseph McGee


Joseph McGee is the founder of McGee Productions USA. This was founded in 2017 by Joseph McGee; McGee Productions is a video production company serving New England. We specialize in short/feature films and music videos. Mr. McGee serves as the writer, director, and producer for his company.  I want to thank you for visiting our campaign and appreciate your support in helping our project. 
“Filming is much like an unfinished art project; it’s defined to a degree but always a work in progress. In order to obtain one’s attention — lines need to be drawn by using abstract colors” – Joseph McGee

Where we need the help....
We still need your help with the following items that will incur the most costs. I'll be putting $5,000 of my own money into this project as a producer which is not counted in the GOAL for this campaign. The money I have will be used for vests, food and other production costs incurred during production. 
The areas where we need your help is outlined in detail below.
PROPS
Motorcycles are needed, we have many background motorcycles that will be provided, but we need more for the riding scenes.  
SET DESIGN

Some locations we are seeking to film at for the NASA scenes, may not be available. If so we may have to build those sets instead for the NASA control room. 
Some of the other scenes we will have to build platforms and sand delivered

EXPLOSIONS
We have used POST explosions in the past, but will be using real explosions for the end scene when the SCORPIONS raid Eugene's compound. We will be hiring a pyrotechnic for this scene. 
LOCATIONS
Some locations will require special insurance and fee's to film at. This will help fund those locations that require a fee. 
EQUIPMENT
For this film we will be seeking the highest quality possible for a INDIE-FILM, and will be utilizing higher end equipment. We will rent or pay a DP to film using ARRI or RED equipment and will incur a cost for this.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>World weary couple Pete and Susan - like the majority of the modern world - have resigned themselves to a life of bleak monotony. They start to question everything they thought they knew when a mysterious boy appears, drenched with rain, on the doorstep of their London home. He claims to come from a world where there is no suffering, a world that is not 'Fallen'. The more they see, the more they begin to wonder: is it true?</p>
<ul>
<li>We, in Britain, are one of the most cynical nations in the world. It’s a sickness that spreads like a virus. We chronically mistrust our leaders; we assume the worst of one another; we fear the technology that is changing everything we once knew... What would it take to reverse our cynicism?</li>
<li>‘Fallen’ is a story and a message I’ve been desperate to tell for 15 years. The sense has been growing stronger and stronger that now is the perfect time. The film has now been cast with incredible actors who I know will uniquely bring ‘Fallen’ to life.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We need £1400 ($2000) to complete the film. This will go towards actor’s fees, travel, accommodation, costume, and other expenses involved in the shoot and post-production. I would LOVE if we could overshoot the goal enough to raise the quality even more, but the important thing is that the film gets made.</li>
<li>As perks for this campaign, you can get a personal message of thanks from the Writer / Director or cast member of your choice. If you are feeling very generous you can book a VIP ticket to the screening  (but please bear in mind this will be in Scotland and dependent on you being able to make the date when it is arranged.) One of our actors, Paul, is also a professional photographer and is generously offering a photo session as a perk. All donations will receive a screener of the film so they can watch as soon as it is released.  </li>
<li>If we don’t reach our goal we will still make the film. But quality may be reduced and this struggling artist will be struggling that bit more!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>I sincerely believe in the power of stories to change lives. Film is a medium of unlimited potential, combining images, light, music and the spoken word together in a way that can make a permanent impact. I believe that, if we can do this short film justice, people will see it and be changed.</li>
<li>I have experience producing and filming a range of projects (my <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm7069776/?ref_=rvi_nm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">IMDb</a>) and I can’t wait to get started on this one.</li>
<li>I love to hear from people. Please do get in touch with any thoughts or questions: matthew@matthew-todd.co.uk</li>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>

If you are a fan of 80's/90's road trip movies and retro video games, this movie is for you. It will capture those warm memories you have for gaming and remind you of those good times while making you laugh along the way. This will be a movie you can watch with the whole family. For fans of the Game Chaser's web series, this is not a 2-hour game chasers episode, it is a feature-length scripted comedy film. However, it will have everything you come to love from the show at its roots, just presented in a new and exciting way!   This will be a different format, of course, from the show (which is reality documentary style) But that's the point, to do something fresh and different!  </p><p>We've had an idea to do a movie for a long time, but it wasn't until someone approached us with the concept of a scripted comedy that the light-bulb went off. Our original idea a few years back was a country-wide road trip going to flea markets. Basically exactly what we do on the YouTube show, still keeping it a ""reality format"", and making it a feature-length movie. And while many might find that idea awesome, I found it boring. It's the same thing we already do just.....longer. And we have to depend on the chance of actually finding games. You wouldn't see Mevor, or Dodongo in it because or work obligations as well. For me, that idea just wasn't exciting. We never pursued it. We never tried to Kickstart it. Maybe we will down the road, but this idea that we have is so much more stimulating creatively for all of us, and a nice breath of fresh air. And the great thing about it for fans is that even though it's a fictional narrative, it still has the essence of the show. It's a refreshing take on Game Chasers. And we are super excited to bring it to life and show the world. </p><p>Now, some people might be concerned over the fact that we have a Producer and that that means someone else other than us is calling the shots. Nothing could be further from the truth. This is OUR project, OUR vision, and the idea and direction is 100 percent OUR creations. We make the decisions. No one controls us, ever. They work for US, not the other way around. I just wanted to ease anyone's concerns that someone else was in charge of this project. This is GAME CHASERS only bigger and badder! What you love about the channel, you will love about this. </p><p>The plan is to shoot over the Spring/Summer and have it ready for release in 2020. There will be a limited theater run, at the minimum here in DFW. But there will also be digital downloads and Blu-rays as well! In the meantime the regular YouTube show isn't going anywhere, so don't worry.  </p><div data-id=""24363130""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1555695463/fxinmk7e3r6j7ueomm6k.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><p> </p><h1>What's it about????</h1><p>Well....I can only say so much.

As I said, this isn't a 2-hour Game Chaser episode. This is not us just taking a camera and going out a few days a week shooting video. We have a producer. We are hiring a professional film crew for this. We want this to be like any other movie you would see in a theater. THIS IS NOT a normal ""web series makes a movie"" scenario. Our goal is to shoot this movie on a RED Camera. A RED camera was used in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, to give you an idea of the quality. I DEMAND that this EXCEEDS your expectations.  We have always reached for the best quality in everything we do, and this is no exception. But besides the film crew, there are so many costs that go into this such as, location costs, insurance, paying the cast, props, transportation, post-production, CGI, licensing, lawyers, to name a few. We will need to hire people to do jobs such as accounting so we don't get sued or have the IRS come after us, a production manager so they can organize the dozens of people need to work on this and keep things on schedule, and also the cost of simple things like food for the crew that will add up quick. Luckily I (Billy) will edit so we can save money on that. As you can see, things add up quickly.  That's why we decided to keep the ball rolling. If we can pre-sale even an extra 100 Blu-rays it will ease the burden. </p><div data-href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mo8yKKN8qFU""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""344"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mo8yKKN8qFU?feature=oembed&amp;wmode=transparent"" width=""612""></iframe></div></div><h1>This is a Pre-Sell. </h1><p>This is a way for you to assure yourself a copy of the movie </p><p>We more than likely not make any profit off this. And we have no plans to pay OURSELVES for the work. Kyle Newman recently said he made nothing off the movie Fanboys in the end. I can see that happening with us. This is a passion project, but even passion projects require funding. If you want to see this movie made let's pull together an make one hell of a movie! </p><p><strong>Here is a pie chart that will show (generally) where the money will be spent. This as of now is a best guess, some areas could end up being cheaper, others more expensive.</strong></p><div data-id=""22992948""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1555695468/ud6srstiehq4helyahva.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><div data-id=""22993018""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1555695469/vuki6nxpbdjqfu97raba.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><h1>Here are a few further breakdowns of what you saw on the graph, and why exactly we need them. These are the jobs/things we will actually have to pay for and not get the ""friend"" hook-up.</h1><p><strong>Production Manager</strong> - This person handles the business side of things. Like managing the budget, making sure people get paid, employment issues, paperwork and etc. </p><p><strong>Cinematographer</strong> - Behind the director (Billy and Melvor) this is the most important crew member. He or she is responsible for the look and cinematography of the movie. We can't do everything, so this person is vital for us. We want to hire someone who knows what they are doing, a professional. This will obviously cost but will be worth it. We want the movie to look good! But beyond that, if we hire someone who is cheap and inexperienced we run the risk of them making a mistake, and a mistake on a movie set can cost thousands of dollars and days of shooting. </p><p><strong>Audio Tech</strong> - This person is responsible for recording the audio on the set. Again, if someone messes up this job it can cost money and time, so a professional is needed. </p><p><strong>Assistant Director - </strong>While the director and co directors focus on the actual movie making, the Assistant director does the important ""dirty"" work to free up the directors time. Such as breaking down the script and planning the shooting days, and making sure all the people who need to be on set a certain day are there. They find the best and most efficient way to organize the shooting days to save time and money. </p><p><strong>Set Building</strong> - This is a must, and an expensive must. Some of our settings will need to be created because finding a real-life location that we need will be near impossible. I wish I could go into more detail but I would be giving away to much of the plot. Let's just say we will need to create a set that looks like it's from 1988. Also, a few of our settings would be impossible to film in a real life location because there would be no space to fit a camera and crew, so one would need to be built with only 3 walls, so a camera crew could be behind the ""fourth wall"". All this would need to be built on a sound stage which we would have to rent out from someone. Plus add the cost for materials and people to build said sets.  </p><p><strong>Film Equipment</strong> - The DP will have a lot of gear but we will more than likely need to rent more and that cost can add up quick. Things such as camera mounts for a car, jibs, lenses, and lighting. Maybe even another camera if needed.  </p><p><strong>Location fees </strong>- When we CAN shoot in real outside locations rather it be a building, a town, or someone's house, it is rarely ever free. Someone, whoever owns it, will want to be paid. Believe me, we will try to find a place for free or cheap, but it might not be possible.  </p><p><strong>Special Effects Tech</strong> - Sometimes its cheaper and easier to use miniatures instead of full size real life objects for a particular scene. Tons of movies use models and you never realized it. Apollo 13 and Avatar are two to come to mind, and we have one of the model makers who worked on those movies on board to work with us! He knows the art of the craft and how to make them look real on camera. We are talking professional half-scale and quarter-scale models, not little toys. Big difference. This will make our life SO much easier for a few things we have planned, but we still have to pay him. But it's totally worth it.</p><p><strong>Actors</strong> - Some of the main actors will be friends, others will not. Regardless, we will still need to pay them. We can't ask someone to step away from work for a week, or a month, or even a few days for shooting and expect them to do it for free. We will also have a lot of actors who are not our friends...we will definitely need to pay them.... </p><p><strong>Flight/hotel</strong> -  This is another costly but necessary expense. We will need to fly actors and crew in and out all through the shooting phase. </p><p><strong>Catering</strong> - This is not in the pie graph but still important. You can't starve your actors or crew while shooting all day. Food will add up quickly. I hope they like Taco Bell...or bread and water...</p><p><strong>Insurance/legal</strong> - I hate this one, but it's a must. We are treading new ground here. We have to do things on the up and up to protect ourselves. We can't afford to get sued if someone gets hurt on set. And an entertainment lawyer is a MUST on a movie. One product or logo shown might open ourselves up to get sued, so we need council to tell us what's off limits. </p><p><strong>CGI artist</strong> - I already mentioned this but we have an artist who has worked on the Walking Dead on board. Now when I say CGI I don't necessarily mean crazy CGI sets or creatures (for the most part), a lot of CGI you see you don't even know you...see it.. Like wire removal, or fixing a mistake in the scene. CGI is an amazing tool to have, especially when a lot of times its cheaper than just re-shooting a scene. Cheaper...but not free</p><p><strong>Miscellaneous</strong> - This is everything else. Anything from fixing a broken piece of equipment, to gas for driving to a location.  On a movie set, something can always go wrong. An example would be as follows: <em>We have scheduled a two-day shoot that's outside at a certain location. We have 12 cast and crew members that need to be there, and we have flights booked for everyone. The shoot day comes and then...it RAINS! We have to pay for two extra days of hotels for everyone and reschedule return flights. And some of those people might not be able to stick around after the rain to shoot, so we could have to re-shoot it a week or two later.</em>Yeah, that would be a nightmare. An expensive nightmare. If we get more than expected out of this campaign, then this slice of the pie will get filled up even more due to the old saying, ""what can go wrong will go wrong"". </p><h1>Check out the production team so far.

Well, here it is. PLEASE UNDERSTAND, the movie WILL get made. We hit our goal. This is just a way to be able to bring in a little more to pay for a few more actors and equipment (lens) rental to make it even better. We might even be able to add an original Stan Bush song to the movie. We also had many people's payments not go through from the Kickstarter, so this is a way for them to try again to get what they want.Also...if you only got a Blu-ray before and now want to get a script page, this is a perfect time. The Game Chasers' Motion Picture is a freaking AWESOME fictional adventure following Billy and Jay as they go on the road to track down a childhood gaming relic. If you are a fan of 80's/90's road trip movies and retro video games, this movie is for you. It will capture those warm memories you have for gaming and remind you of those good times while making you laugh along the way. This will be a movie you can watch with the whole family. For fans of the Game Chaser's web series, this is not a 2-hour game chasers episode, it is a feature-length scripted comedy film. However, it will have everything you come to love from the show at its roots, just presented in a new and exciting way!   This will be a different format, of course, from the show (which is reality documentary style) But that's the point, to do something fresh and different!  We've had an idea to do a movie for a long time, but it wasn't until someone approached us with the concept of a scripted comedy that the light-bulb went off. Our original idea a few years back was a country-wide road trip going to flea markets. Basically exactly what we do on the YouTube show, still keeping it a ""reality format"", and making it a feature-length movie. And while many might find that idea awesome, I found it boring. It's the same thing we already do just.....longer. And we have to depend on the chance of actually finding games. You wouldn't see Mevor, or Dodongo in it because or work obligations as well. For me, that idea just wasn't exciting. We never pursued it. We never tried to Kickstart it. Maybe we will down the road, but this idea that we have is so much more stimulating creatively for all of us, and a nice breath of fresh air. And the great thing about it for fans is that even though it's a fictional narrative, it still has the essence of the show. It's a refreshing take on Game Chasers. And we are super excited to bring it to life and show the world. Now, some people might be concerned over the fact that we have a Producer and that that means someone else other than us is calling the shots. Nothing could be further from the truth. This is OUR project, OUR vision, and the idea and direction is 100 percent OUR creations. We make the decisions. No one controls us, ever. They work for US, not the other way around. I just wanted to ease anyone's concerns that someone else was in charge of this project. This is GAME CHASERS only bigger and badder! What you love about the channel, you will love about this. The plan is to shoot over the Spring/Summer and have it ready for release in 2020. There will be a limited theater run, at the minimum here in DFW. But there will also be digital downloads and Blu-rays as well! In the meantime the regular YouTube show isn't going anywhere, so don't worry.   What's it about????Well....I can only say so much. A lot of what will make it awesome to see for the first time is the big surprise we have in store. That's good enough, right??? RIGHT? NO? Fine......I can give a quick synopsis, I suppose...... Billy and Jay go on a road trip to track down a childhood gaming relic. And of course...a ridiculous adventure ensues.....a ridiculous adventure but not TOO outside the bounds of reality. Its main purpose is to be FUN to watch but also make you feel good!Think of this as a fictionalized Game Chasers Prequel. A fun re-telling of how 2 friends became game collectors. It will be what you have come to love about the show mixed with stuff you would have never expected, but still fitting in with the spirit of what we do. And also mixed with bigfoots and aliens. Maybe. ;)
 
 
 
Ok, how about this? How about I list some words that are out of context but have actual meaning in the movie. Yes, Im a tease. Mountain, NES, Shotgun, Campfire, Star Fighter, Gnome, 1988, Flea Market, Lemmy, Battle Toads, Rental, Motorcycle, Gaiden, Photograph, Basement, Drone, Trunk, Punchout, Tetris, Jarr, Abandoned. That's all you get. For now....For another tease...scroll to the bottom and see a page from the actual script. This is just a teaser paying homage to Gremlins, not any official artIn this video we go into the story a little more to hopefully help you understand the theme of what its all about.  Many of the Game Chasers show fan's favorite episodes were ones that made them both laugh and cry, and this movie will capture that same feeling. You will laugh, cry, cheer, and reflect. Fans of the web-show will get enjoyment out it, as well as those who are not familiar. Its a movie for fans and newcomers alike.   I (Billy)  have a passion for storytelling. I have enjoyed making the Game Chasers web series and will continue to do so, but my favorite projects have always been the ones where I can tell a story and or just be creative. The Under The Bridge Game Chasers Episode and our cartoons display that the most, I believe. This movie has been in the planning stages for a while now, but we feel it's finally time to move forward with it.  Your support is STILL greatly appreciated and critical for it's success.Making a movie of this magnitude is expensive. As I said, this isn't a 2-hour Game Chaser episode. This is not us just taking a camera and going out a few days a week shooting video. We have a producer. We are hiring a professional film crew for this. We want this to be like any other movie you would see in a theater. THIS IS NOT a normal ""web series makes a movie"" scenario. Our goal is to shoot this movie on a RED Camera. A RED camera was used in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, to give you an idea of the quality. I DEMAND that this EXCEEDS your expectations.  We have always reached for the best quality in everything we do, and this is no exception. But besides the film crew, there are so many costs that go into this such as, location costs, insurance, paying the cast, props, transportation, post-production, CGI, licensing, lawyers, to name a few. We will need to hire people to do jobs such as accounting so we don't get sued or have the IRS come after us, a production manager so they can organize the dozens of people need to work on this and keep things on schedule, and also the cost of simple things like food for the crew that will add up quick. Luckily I (Billy) will edit so we can save money on that. As you can see, things add up quickly.  That's why we decided to keep the ball rolling. If we can pre-sale even an extra 100 Blu-rays it will ease the burden. This is a Pre-Sell. This is a way for you to assure yourself a copy of the movie We more than likely not make any profit off this. And we have no plans to pay OURSELVES for the work. Kyle Newman recently said he made nothing off the movie Fanboys in the end. I can see that happening with us. This is a passion project, but even passion projects require funding. If you want to see this movie made let's pull together an make one hell of a movie! Here is a pie chart that will show (generally) where the money will be spent. This as of now is a best guess, some areas could end up being cheaper, others more expensive.Here are a few further breakdowns of what you saw on the graph, and why exactly we need them. These are the jobs/things we will actually have to pay for and not get the ""friend"" hook-up.Production Manager - This person handles the business side of things. Like managing the budget, making sure people get paid, employment issues, paperwork and etc. Cinematographer - Behind the director (Billy and Melvor) this is the most important crew member. He or she is responsible for the look and cinematography of the movie. We can't do everything, so this person is vital for us. We want to hire someone who knows what they are doing, a professional. This will obviously cost but will be worth it. We want the movie to look good! But beyond that, if we hire someone who is cheap and inexperienced we run the risk of them making a mistake, and a mistake on a movie set can cost thousands of dollars and days of shooting. Audio Tech - This person is responsible for recording the audio on the set. Again, if someone messes up this job it can cost money and time, so a professional is needed. Assistant Director - While the director and co directors focus on the actual movie making, the Assistant director does the important ""dirty"" work to free up the directors time. Such as breaking down the script and planning the shooting days, and making sure all the people who need to be on set a certain day are there. They find the best and most efficient way to organize the shooting days to save time and money. Set Building - This is a must, and an expensive must. Some of our settings will need to be created because finding a real-life location that we need will be near impossible. I wish I could go into more detail but I would be giving away to much of the plot. Let's just say we will need to create a set that looks like it's from 1988. Also, a few of our settings would be impossible to film in a real life location because there would be no space to fit a camera and crew, so one would need to be built with only 3 walls, so a camera crew could be behind the ""fourth wall"". All this would need to be built on a sound stage which we would have to rent out from someone. Plus add the cost for materials and people to build said sets.  Film Equipment - The DP will have a lot of gear but we will more than likely need to rent more and that cost can add up quick. Things such as camera mounts for a car, jibs, lenses, and lighting. Maybe even another camera if needed.  Location fees - When we CAN shoot in real outside locations rather it be a building, a town, or someone's house, it is rarely ever free. Someone, whoever owns it, will want to be paid. Believe me, we will try to find a place for free or cheap, but it might not be possible.  Special Effects Tech - Sometimes its cheaper and easier to use miniatures instead of full size real life objects for a particular scene. Tons of movies use models and you never realized it. Apollo 13 and Avatar are two to come to mind, and we have one of the model makers who worked on those movies on board to work with us! He knows the art of the craft and how to make them look real on camera. We are talking professional half-scale and quarter-scale models, not little toys. Big difference. This will make our life SO much easier for a few things we have planned, but we still have to pay him. But it's totally worth it.Actors - Some of the main actors will be friends, others will not. Regardless, we will still need to pay them. We can't ask someone to step away from work for a week, or a month, or even a few days for shooting and expect them to do it for free. We will also have a lot of actors who are not our friends...we will definitely need to pay them.... Flight/hotel -  This is another costly but necessary expense. We will need to fly actors and crew in and out all through the shooting phase. Catering - This is not in the pie graph but still important. You can't starve your actors or crew while shooting all day. Food will add up quickly. I hope they like Taco Bell...or bread and water...Insurance/legal - I hate this one, but it's a must. We are treading new ground here. We have to do things on the up and up to protect ourselves. We can't afford to get sued if someone gets hurt on set. And an entertainment lawyer is a MUST on a movie. One product or logo shown might open ourselves up to get sued, so we need council to tell us what's off limits. CGI artist - I already mentioned this but we have an artist who has worked on the Walking Dead on board. Now when I say CGI I don't necessarily mean crazy CGI sets or creatures (for the most part), a lot of CGI you see you don't even know you...see it.. Like wire removal, or fixing a mistake in the scene. CGI is an amazing tool to have, especially when a lot of times its cheaper than just re-shooting a scene. Cheaper...but not freeMiscellaneous - This is everything else. Anything from fixing a broken piece of equipment, to gas for driving to a location.  On a movie set, something can always go wrong. An example would be as follows: We have scheduled a two-day shoot that's outside at a certain location. We have 12 cast and crew members that need to be there, and we have flights booked for everyone. The shoot day comes and then...it RAINS! We have to pay for two extra days of hotels for everyone and reschedule return flights. And some of those people might not be able to stick around after the rain to shoot, so we could have to re-shoot it a week or two later.Yeah, that would be a nightmare. An expensive nightmare. If we get more than expected out of this campaign, then this slice of the pie will get filled up even more due to the old saying, ""what can go wrong will go wrong"". Check out the production team so far. It isn't just a bunch of chodes (for the most part), we have real industry people working on this with us!  More on CGI With YoshiHere, Yoshi talks about a somewhat unknown use for CGI that can have a huge impact on storytelling. CGI isn't just for space battles and crazy aliens....for the most part. here is Yoshi's IMDB and demo reelhttps://m.imdb.com/name/nm4668929/ We are NOT asking for FREE money. You will get stuff in return. We are offering some cool rewards for you! You are the VIP of this project. You only have to contribute once to see it! If you ever wanted to be a part of a movie, see how it works up close, and know you helped make it happen, then we have a ton of cool rewards just for you! And remember, you can pledge as many times as you like. If you only want a digital download now, you can always come back before the campaign ends and get a Blu-Ray as well, or one of the higher rewards. Take a look on the right-hand side of all the reward details, but some of the stuff included are:Ultimate Combo Pack!This is the ultimate pack! Get the Blu-Ray, Shirt, name in the credits, and filming vlogs! This IS the combo you are looking for...Actual concept art drawn for the movieCome To the Premiere! Come hang out and see the premiere of the movie with us! This will be a special private first screening! Get VIP tickets and dinner with the cast and crew! It will be a blast, don't miss out!pic is for example only. Official venue to be determined.Hang out on set, and or be in the movie!Want a once in a life time chance to be behind the scenes when a movie is made? Or even update your IMDB profile with a role IN the movie? Either way, you are sure to have a hell of a time. not the official sound-stage, pic only used as examplePages from the First Working Draft! This is a page from Jay's first draft of the script. There are notes as we made changes. You can get a page like this from one of 3 first draft working scripts from Billy, Jay, or Melvor.(Obviously the black lines are only so we don't give away the plot here on the kickstarter page and your page wont have them)This is censored pic of an actual page of the actual script. Your page will have no black bars There are even more awesome rewards to choose from! Just check out the list on the right side of the page and pick the one that is right for you! Or heck, maybe even 2 or 3...no nuts!Oh, one more thing..... Blu-Ray, and poster art not yet finalizedBlu-Rays - These are not cheap to produce. There is a reason most of the film kickstarter projects don't have this perk and the ones that do have them priced higher than a Blu-ray would normally be, it takes money away from your movie budget to make them. However, I know you most of you love physical media, so despite taking a piece of the budget away we are going to produce them for you! They will have exclusive stuff only found on the Kickstater Pre-order, so don't miss out! When we run out of these Blu-rays and print more to sell at cons and online well after the movie is out, they will be cheaper but have less content. So these are DEFINITELY the versions to get! These Kickstarter versions will have TWO discs with so much extra content. Plus...if you guys don't buy these now....we wont have the money to make the movie...Artwork - The artwork on the BLu-Ray and shirts are just to have visuals for the Kickstarter and are not the final product. I plan on hiring an awesome artist to make the poster/blur-Ray cover and make it look super epic.Remember, if you want to throw in an extra dollar or $2 or $1000.....(i'm looking at you Bill Gates)....over what the perk costs, it will help! The more that do that, the more likely this goal will be met and exceeded. What About Game Chasers on Youtube???Does this mean the end of the Game Chasers series? No way! In fact, check out the video below to learn how there could be MORE Game Chasers/Toy Chasers/ AND Chasing the Unknown.Lastly, let me list a few films that we were inspired by while writing this script: FanboysPee Wee's Big AdventureDumb and DumberBilly MadisonGremlinsGhostbusters Tommy Boy Other Ways You Can HelpSome people can't help fund this, but that doesn't mean they can't help:If you want to help by offering your services (construction, make-up, costumes, etc) please let us know.  And it would be radical if you want to share this with everyone! I will share any video made by you that promotes this Kickstarter and encourages support! Make everyone aware!Thank you so much for stopping in and checking this out. Together we can make this happen!Everything that is on this page is here for a reason. Even things you can barely see..... Update:Here at the bottom I will be posting various auditions as we receive them. Some for VERY small roles, and some for bigger ones. Keep in mind they are Auditions, it doesnt mean they have the part. I just wanted to post a few of these as teasers. And they are reading actual lines from the script. Lemmy:",22.0,7,"7 Campaigns

This is the second episode of an ongoing series about the sordid tales of New England:

Created by Tatiana O'Hanlon and filmed by students of Fitchburg State University
This series is to shed light on the creepy stories of New England towns
The goal is to explore more of New England and learn about the history of the 5 states that never get told.


What We Need & What You Get
To break down what we are looking for:

We are looking to raise a total of $750 for this installment. That would cover the cost of food, gas money, and labor for cast and crew. This would also cover actor and music designer fees.

$1+ you will receive a thank you in the credit
$5+ you will receive New England Nightmare stickers!
$20+ you will receive an early cut of the short film with both episodes
$30+ you will receive an Executive Producer credit


If we don't receive all the funds for our film, we will still use what we have raised to finish our film. We will use the money mainly to pay for travel expenses and our music designer fee. 


The Impact
The impact we are looking to make is to highlight untold stories of our beloved states:

To spark a sense of connection to the stories when it is set in your hometown/state.
We have already completed one episode and are looking to make this next episode the best it can be.
The stories told are bone-chillingly true stories that nobody knows about but many would enjoy. 


Risks & Challenges
The risks and challenges that we are facing are that we only have 30 days to reach our goal. Under this time limit, we are in production of this film and the money is coming out of the filmmakers' pockets.

It wasn’t malicious; it wasn't a government conspiracy; we just got some things wrong. 'Eating fat makes you fat' seemed logical. Cholesterol in food and cholesterol in clogged arteries seemed like an obvious connection. 'Heart healthy grains' was repeated so many times by so many reputable organizations, we just accepted it as fact. The problem is, none of it’s true.</p><p>I’ve been a filmmaker since middle school. I’ve also built and sold a tech company, worked as a mechanical engineer, and now, I’ve quit my job to devote the rest of my life to this cause. I’ve researched every conflicting dietary approach and it’s all finally starting to make sense—even some of the vegan arguments. I’ve put this research into practice, and now, at age 35, I’m in the best shape of my life. My vitals and blood work are flawless and I haven’t been sick in 3 years. The same goes for countless family, friends, and millions around the world.</p><p>We’re so close to finishing this film, but we need your support.

<h3>Hello there!</h3>
<p><strong>ENG</strong></p>
<p>Hi. I'm Alan Koprivec, a filmmaker and a screenwriter graduate. I'm twenty-four years old, and I was born and raised in Lugano, Switzerland. I met Cesco in August at the Locarno Film Festival where he was performing at the time, and that same evening, talking on the train, I came up with a documentary idea about his upcoming trip to Italy. </p>
<p>Who is Cesco? Born in Bari on September 23, 1999, for 8 years now he has been bringing his magic and mime performances all over Europe. His shows entertains thousands of people not only in the streets but also on social media, achieving a rapid success of followers close to one million on TikTok.</p>
<p>Social Busker proposes itself as a street performance documentary, taking Cesco and his life during and outside of the shows as he travels all over Italy, from north to south.</p>
<p>The subject of the documentary aims to tell the point of view of the busker (the street artist), through the journey and his encounters. The film aims to show a reality often ignored and often denigrated. </p>
<p><strong>ITA</strong></p>
<p>Ciao! Sono Alan Koprivec, regista e sceneggiatore diplomato. Ho ventiquattro anni, e sono nato e cresciuto a Lugano, in Svizzera. Ho conosciuto Cesco ad agosto al festival del cinema di Locarno dove si esibiva in quel momento, e la sera stessa, parlando sul treno gli ho proposto di fare un documentario sul suo prossimo viaggio in Italia. </p>
<p>Chi è Cesco? Nato a Bari il 23 Settembre 1999, da 8 anni porta le sue esibizioni<i> </i>di magia e mimica, in tutta Europa.  I suoi spettacoli animano migliaia di persone non solo in strada ma anche sui social, ottenendo un successo rapido di <i>followers  </i>prossimo al milione su TikTok.</p>

<p>The second is a purely economic issue, since the period of filming will take place during the fundraising and which means we will start with our own funds without even knowing if the campaign will go well or not, so it is a risk for us that we will totally assume.

Hi. I'm Alan Koprivec, a filmmaker and a screenwriter graduate. I'm twenty-four years old, and I was born and raised in Lugano, Switzerland. I met Cesco in August at the Locarno Film Festival where he was performing at the time, and that same evening, talking on the train, I came up with a documentary idea about his upcoming trip to Italy. 
Who is Cesco? Born in Bari on September 23, 1999, for 8 years now he has been bringing his magic and mime performances all over Europe. His shows entertains thousands of people not only in the streets but also on social media, achieving a rapid success of followers close to one million on TikTok.
Social Busker proposes itself as a street performance documentary, taking Cesco and his life during and outside of the shows as he travels all over Italy, from north to south.
The subject of the documentary aims to tell the point of view of the busker (the street artist), through the journey and his encounters. The film aims to show a reality often ignored and often denigrated.

What We Need & What You Get/ Di cosa abbiamo bisogno e cosa riceverai
ENG
Regardless of the amount received, every donation counts. It will entirely cover the project and the people that gets to be part of it; equipment rental, post-production, transportation, and housing.
The rewards for your help are many and unique, as every single product you will receive, in digital or physical format, has been conceived and produced entirely by us. So it goes from the various thanks in the credits, ranging from tier 4 to tier 1, through t-shirts, sweatshirts, blu-ray and even you could join a live performance by Cesco wherever you want!
If we do not reach the required amount, the project will still be completed. We will sacrifice audio and video post production, but the rewards will still be guaranteed.
ITA
Ogni offerta conta, indipendentemente dall'ammontare. La cifra richiesta sarà interamente indirizzata al progetto e alle persone che ne fanno parte; noleggio attrezzatura, post-produzione, trasporti e alloggi.
Le ricompense per il vostro aiuto sono tante e uniche, in quanto ogni singolo prodotto che riceverete, in formato digitale o fisico, è stato pensato e prodotto interamente da noi. Si va quindi dai vari ringraziamenti nei titoli di coda, che vanno dal tier 4 al tier 1, passando per magliette, felpe, blu-ray e molto altro fino ad arrivare ad uno spettacolo di Cesco live dove vuoi tu!
Se non dovessimo ricevere la somma richiesta, il progetto sarà comunque portato a termine. Andremo a sacrificare per forza di cose, fattori quali la post produzione audio e quella video, ma le ricompense saranno comunque garantite.

<h2>Telling An Untold Story </h2>
<p>The idea for 'Catch A Butcher' came from our writer/director Cassiah Joski-Jethi's own experience of the pressure to suppress and express different sides of her heritage. Upon further research into Anglo-Indian history, we discovered stories of complex dynamics between Indian mothers and their mixed race children who were at the mercy of their British fathers and the British Empire, especially in the late 19th century when there was a huge cultural shift against mixed race children. These themes are reflected in 'Catch a Butcher' by the cult-like maternity ward that secretly prepares mixed race babies in horrific ways to be separated from their native mothers and sent back to England. But reaching beyond colonial India, the pressure to identify with one side of your identity over another crosses into societal and cultural pressures even today, and 'Catch A Butcher' looks at the devastating consequences of this. Our film is told through the prospective of four female nurses; one mixed race, one caucasian, and two Indian, making it an extremely diverse and unique proposal. We believe there has never been a film like this, and we are thrilled to explore these women and shine a light on their untold stories.</p>

<h2>Our Film &amp; The Horror Genre</h2>
<p>In recent years, there has been a trend in films utilising horror tropes to explore the fear of how society forces oppressed groups to “change”. Whether it be the creation of a “White Voice” in ‘Sorry to Bother You’; the decision to stay an oppressed woman or change into a free goat in ‘I Am Not a Witch’; or being forced into the sunken place and changed into a mindless slave in ‘Get Out’, modern films are presenting the complicated nature of how society forces oppressed groups to change. We are looking to join these films with ‘Catch a Butcher’, an intense horror-thriller that explores the horror of a cult-like 19th century hospital ""caring for"" mixed race babies and forcing them to assimilate into white English culture. This forced “change” creates the horror that we believe will get under the audiences skin, while also making important social statements about our history as a country with colonialism, and the feelings and struggles of mixed race individuals.</p>

<h3>Directors Statement</h3>
<p>""‘Catch A Butcher’ was grown out of a desire to learn more about my own mixed race heritage. Growing up, I found it difficult to negotiate my Indian heritage and identity, feeling a pressure from society to “choose” my white side above all else, and ‘Catch A Butcher’ is a visual metaphor for this. I want the film to reclaim and celebrate my Indian heritage, hence why I use Hindi throughout the script but not translated. Just as Western colonialism imposed their language and beliefs on other cultures, this film is in direct opposition to that. The film will allow those with the knowledge of Indian culture to pick up the subtle contexts expressed in the title and in the dialogue, and will hopefully prompt audiences who do not know this language to research and find out for themselves, ensuring they can be an active participant in delving into the context behind the film.""</p>
<h3>Director Biography </h3>
<p>Cassiah began her career being mentored by Gurinder Chadha OBE who took Cassiah under her wing after a chance meeting on a train. As a director, Cassiah is motivated to tell stories through a female lens, and often her work explores the projection of femininity, the subversion of typical female roles, and dual heritage/identity. Cassiah’s directorial debut 'Polly' (2017), about a teenager wanting to escape an all-female cult, was a short film winner at the Moondance International Film Festival 2018. Her second short 'Woman of the Night' (2018), about a mother who secretly works as a bouncer, premiered at the Short Cinema in Leicester in 2018. Cassiah recently completed her third short ‘Kindling’ (2019) about fairy tales coming to life to help a girl to escape an abusive home. Cassiah is also a writer represented by SMA Talent in London. Her award nominated stage plays have been performed in theatres across the country and she is currently working on a number of commissions for independent film and TV companies. In addition, Cassiah is currently a member of the BFI Network X BAFTA Crew, and is being mentored by Film London producer Angeli Macfarlane as part of the scheme.</p>

<h2>Budget</h2>
<p>We have already secured some funds from various sources, and we need to raise our minimum production budget of around £32,000. This will allow us to pay our talented, experienced team of creatives we have already brought on to the project, rent out high quality equipment, attach top acting talent, pay for prosthetics and special effects, and to hire out lavish locations such as Highbury Hall, which has been used often in the past as a location for the BBC. </p>
<p>However, we have also created possible projections for a bigger budget, allowing us to be even more ambitious with our film, and increase the quality even more. This includes budget for travelling a small number of crew to India, to possibly shoot some exterior scenes on location there. </p>
</div><div>
<p> </p>
<h2>Shining A Light on the Midlands </h2>
<p>A feature of Cassiah's work is to base her productions in the Midlands. Therefore, our production will have a Midlands focus, and as such, we will be actively looking to engage with the local area. Some of our initial plans include:</p>
<p>-  Working with interns from underprivileged areas who would not usually have access to the film industry, giving them the opportunity to work behind the scenes on a film set</p>
<p>- Shooting the majority of our film in locations across the Midlands </p>
<p>- Collaborating with Midlands-based companies to support the local industry </p>
<p>- Auditioning talent from the Midlands region for the lead role of Deandria </p>

</div></div>","Telling An Untold Story 
The idea for 'Catch A Butcher' came from our writer/director Cassiah Joski-Jethi's own experience of the pressure to suppress and express different sides of her heritage. Upon further research into Anglo-Indian history, we discovered stories of complex dynamics between Indian mothers and their mixed race children who were at the mercy of their British fathers and the British Empire, especially in the late 19th century when there was a huge cultural shift against mixed race children. These themes are reflected in 'Catch a Butcher' by the cult-like maternity ward that secretly prepares mixed race babies in horrific ways to be separated from their native mothers and sent back to England. But reaching beyond colonial India, the pressure to identify with one side of your identity over another crosses into societal and cultural pressures even today, and 'Catch A Butcher' looks at the devastating consequences of this. Our film is told through the prospective of four female nurses; one mixed race, one caucasian, and two Indian, making it an extremely diverse and unique proposal. We believe there has never been a film like this, and we are thrilled to explore these women and shine a light on their untold stories.

 
Our Film & The Horror Genre
In recent years, there has been a trend in films utilising horror tropes to explore the fear of how society forces oppressed groups to “change”. Whether it be the creation of a “White Voice” in ‘Sorry to Bother You’; the decision to stay an oppressed woman or change into a free goat in ‘I Am Not a Witch’; or being forced into the sunken place and changed into a mindless slave in ‘Get Out’, modern films are presenting the complicated nature of how society forces oppressed groups to change. We are looking to join these films with ‘Catch a Butcher’, an intense horror-thriller that explores the horror of a cult-like 19th century hospital ""caring for"" mixed race babies and forcing them to assimilate into white English culture. This forced “change” creates the horror that we believe will get under the audiences skin, while also making important social statements about our history as a country with colonialism, and the feelings and struggles of mixed race individuals.

<p>The dog meat industry in South Korea is
exceptionally cruel, is not regulated, and laws for slaughtering dogs
inhumanely are not currently enforced. If you want evidence of just how cruel,
see the short video shot by undercover CARE workers and used by The Korea
Observer in an expose on former dog pets being killed by slaughter yards for
consumption:<a rel=""noopener nofollow""><span></span></a><a href=""http://goo.gl/025clD"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""http://goo.gl/025cID"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://goo.gl/025cID</a>. </p>
<p><span></span><a href=""http://koreaobserver.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Korea Observer </a> intends to do a complete expose of the dog meat
industry in South Korea. This includes engaging key political officials, dog
farmers, legal officials, animal welfare groups, dog meat restaurant owners,
police, judges, and who ever else is appropriate. Ideally, through a collective
effort, we would like our investigative work to prompt a series of actions that
lead to the end of dog meat farming and dog meat consumption in Korea. We will
aim for this utopian goal but it may not be feasible in the short term. </p>
<p>At
the very least, The Korea Observer will interview officials and question why
they do not impose licensing conditions and strict regulations on the dog meat
industry to minimise the cruelty exhibited to dogs and former pets that are
often tortured prior to being killed, fed the remains of killed dogs, kept in
overcrowded, unsanitary conditions, and stacked on top of each other alive in
small cages while being transported to market.  </p>
<p>We
will show officials film we've captured, demonstrate that many Korean officials
are ashamed of the industry, and use statistics to show that the world looks
down on Korea due to their dog meat industry. </p><p>UPDATE:- SOME OF THE WORK MAY BE ABLE TO BE DONE BY SKILLED VOLUNTEERS AND THEREFORE THE COST OF PRODUCTION WILL REDUCE CONSIDERABLY. In the interests of transparency: an animal activist and dog shelter owner in Korea has raised valid concerns about us purchasing equipment for this documentary and using some paid staff (i.e., not ALL volunteers). He also messaged several Facebook groups where we advertised the documentary strongly requesting no-one donate based on these concerns. I have addressed these concerns with him and offered the following:</p><p>""I agree that if volunteers come forward we’ll utilise them thus reducing the expense but we need some highly skilled technical staff who are unable to volunteer their time. Leftover funds will be apportioned and donated to those who have volunteered their time and to animal welfare groups in Korea.""</p><p><br/></p><p></p><h1>UPDATE:</h1><br/><p>1. Koreandogs.org</p><p>A HUGE thank you to <a href=""http://koreandogs.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://koreandogs.org/</a> who have donate $3500 for this documentary.

We will do our best to achieve what we can with whatever budget we get and hope that we get volunteers with technical skills and the use of equipment donated. [FYI - I used to have all the equipment required but was robbed and insurance did not cover us]. In summary, we will go ahead with the documentary if we only raise 10K, but it will be with less quality equipment, less technically skilled staff (i.e., volunteers), and it may not get as much exposure as we'd like it to].

The Online Media Company – what we’ve done so far </h1>
<p>The
Korea Observer is a relatively new media start-up that was inspired by Tae-hoon
Lee after he witnessed the corruption and malpractice of media moguls in South
Korea. “I was really ashamed of collecting pay checks for writing pro-government
articles and paid content while working for Arirang TV and the Korea Times,”
Lee Tae-hoon, publisher at the Korea Observer said. </p>
<p>James
Hyams joined as the deputy managing editor late 2014 following Lee Tae-hoon’s
great work. He liked the notion of providing “A Voice for the Voiceless” and
thinks that The Korea Observer can be the best English news service in South
Korea with time, hard work, and enough resources. </p>
<p>Since
its inception in Feb 2013, The Korea Observer has reported news that would
otherwise be ignored with the motto: “A Voice for the Voiceless.” The topics
we’ve covered include the exclusion of specific races from jobs and bars,
corporate malpractice and corruption, human rights abuses, LGBT rejection and
discrimination, animal cruelty including the dog meat industry, child abuse in
kindergartens, immigration and deportation issues, expat equality and rights,
and so on. </p>
<p> Some
notable publications include Boeing’s bribery of journalists with sexual
entertainment, a Korean bar’s ban of Africans based on fears of Ebola, and the
exposing the dog meat industry in South Korea to expats. We’ve also broken
numerous stories, including human rights abuses by the Miss Asia Pacific World
contest, Korea’s denial of entry to ‘pickup artist’ Julien Blanc, and an
African American’s rejection for job interviews for being black in Korea. </p>
<p>The
Korea Observer was accepted into Google News early 2015. We are now competing
with mainstream English speaking press in Korea on a zero dollar budget.
Imagine what we could do with their massive budgets!  </p>
<div><br/></div><div>
<h1>The
people behind the company </h1>
<p>Tae-hoon
and James Hyams volunteer their time. Tae-hoon has not had a wage since
February 2013. </p>
<p>James
is a social worker in Australia and this pays the bills. He works remotely for
The Korea Observer. Without funding, we are severely limited to what we can do
with The Korea Observer. </p>
<p><i>Tae-hoon Lee</i></p>
<p>Lee Tae-hoon founded The Korea Observer in
hopes of reporting news that would otherwise be ignored by the mainstream media
in Korea. He quit Arirang TV after witnessing its senior staff officials
embezzle money. Senior staff created accounts in false names and skimmed money
from payments to contract workers. Lee later exposed those responsible in order
to hold them accountable (<a rel=""noopener nofollow""><span></span></a><a href=""http://bit.ly/1GK8Nfs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://bit.ly/1GK8Nfs</a>). </p>
<p>Lee
left the Korea Times after witnessing the paper running advertorials without
any mention of them being paid content and generating revenues under the excuse
of helping multicultural children and others in need of help.</p>
<p><i>James Hyams </i></p>
<p>James
started working as a social worker in 2006 but realized that systemic and
cognitive change is required to improve conditions for those with limited
political and financial power. Despite knowing that journalism is withering and
an income is not guaranteed, James went back to university and studied
journalism, while still working as a social worker, with the hope that he could
expose corporate and political power abuses, corruption, human rights abuse,
animal cruelty cases, enhance opportunities for the less fortunate, and
positively influence change within society. This is a utopian dream that is
slowly being realized with The Korea Observer. </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><h1>Why we
need you </h1>
<p> Like
many media start-ups, we are faced with the daily challenge of publishing
articles without any resources. As noted above, some of our stories have been
quality but some are b-grade pieces that we are not proud of. We have
underutilized skills and a strong desire to regain our roots in investigative
journalism but we need your help to really kickstart major investigations into
topics that will be of international interest. With your support, we intend to
be an active watchdog over Korea and international Korean companies such as
Samsung, LG, Hyundai, Kia, Daewoo, Korean Air, Fila (clothing – yes it is Korea
owned), Posco, SK, Lotte, and so on. </p>
<p>Prior
to investigating these large companies, we are asking for financial assistance
to enable us to expose the dog meat industry in South Korea. As we know, dog
meat is openly consumed in South Korea despite it being a developed, first
world country. </p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">According to animal welfare group CARE the
dog meat industry is massive. The Korean Statistics Information Service
includes dog farming in the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Census. In 2010
they reported 892,820 dogs in 100,191 farms. All of these dogs, plus many dogs
in shelters, pounds, and former pets will end up as food in restaurants or
homes according to many animal welfare groups including CARE, HSI, Nami Kim, and other off-the-record groups. </span><br/></p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1348920/files/20150402054621-map.jpg?1427978781"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><i>The above map comes from a</i> <a href=""http://www.careanimalrights.org/#!field-work/c19b2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">CARE report</a>.</p><p>The industry is not regulated and prosecutions
for animal rights abuses are very rare. The only arrests for illegally hanging
dogs, that we are aware of, occurred after The Korea Observer covered a story
where there was photographic evidence of a Jindo dog being hung by the neck and
killed by two migrants (<span></span><a href=""http://goo.gl/1xh5Ck"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://goo.gl/1xh5Ck"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://goo.gl/1xh5Ck</a>). The
Korea Observer followed up and Animal rights activists reported this to the
police who tracked down and arrested the main perpetrator (<a rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://goo.gl/1Uy3mG"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://goo.gl/1Uy3mG</a>). This matter is before the
courts. Cases, such as this, can often be dismissed by judges without rational
discussion. The onus is usually on the prosecutor to demonstrate that the dog
was a companion dog (i.e., a pet) at the time of slaughter. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1350235/files/20150402144525-Screen_Shot_2015-04-03_at_7.44.30_am.png?1428011125"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>We
intend to explore why these laws are antiquated and behind the rest of the OECD
countries. We intend to obtain footage of slaughterhouses hanging dogs and
provide it to the police and judges for insight into why prosecution is so rare
and follow up with law groups to determine the best action to create conditions
where judges feel compelled to prosecute offenders. </p>
<p>In <a href=""http://www.careanimalrights.org/#!field-work/c19b2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">CARE's full report</a> on the dog industry, they demonstrate that pet auction houses (i.e.,
pet stores) also provide live dogs to slaughterhouses. A pet auction house in
Cheonan holds around 200 dogs including Huskies, Labradors, Golden Retrievers,
Cocker Spaniels, and Grey Hounds. “This is the biggest meat auction market in
South Korea. Ninety percent of the sales here are for meat,” the owner said to CARE investigators.
The Korea Observer will expose this link and the perpetrators. </p>
<p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1350311/files/20150402152029-Screen_Shot_2015-04-03_at_8.19.39_am.png?1428013229"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><i>The above photo is a screenshot from a STOP IT video courtesy of CARE.</i></p><p>When
transporting the dogs, it is common practice for farmers to squash as many live
dogs into one cage as possible as shown in the STOP IT footage obtained from CARE. Most of the time dogs are stacked on top of
each other and do not have enough room to stand up. “Many dogs die in the
summer during transport,” one dog farmer said to investigators. The Korea Observer will follow these farmers to
document how the dogs are mistreated and follow up with officials to determine
if laws are being broken. If it is not illegal, we will question why! </p>
<p>There
are also unconfirmed claims that certain vets are providing companion dogs,
scheduled to be put down, to slaughterhouses in exchange for remuneration. We
will investigate these claims and expose those that cooperate in this practice. </p>
<p>There
are also locals and expats that covertly break into slaughterhouses, kill
shelters, and dog farms that torture animals, and steal (rescue) the dogs prior to
slaughter. These dogs are taken to the vet, given treatment, fed, given foster
homes, and then re-homed locally or internationally. The activists engaged in
these practices have devoted their lifesavings to saving and re-homing
suffering dogs bound for slaughter. Many have sold all their assets, live a
very basic life with only bare essentials to survive, and put all of their
resources into saving dogs. Their stories need to be told! They also courier
some of these dogs over the US for adoption establishing an international dog
saving network, which we also intend to visually document. </p>
<p>The
Korea Observer has been communicating with dog welfare activists since late
2014 to understand the industry and how best to bring about change. We intend
to investigate this industry in its entirety but require funds to do that. The
final product will be written stories with photographs and a gonzo-style
documentary. James will also write an eBook about the investigation. </p><p><br/></p>
<h1>What the funds will
specifically be used for</h1>
<p><b>1.</b> Following the dog meat
trail from Jeju Island to the mainland. Dogs are transported to the South
Korean peninsula from famous Jeju Island twice a week despite representatives
of the Port Development Division in Jeju saying, “Dogs are never transported to
the mainland by boat.” This is the most disturbing method of transportation. We
want to document it in full and interview the transporter. Many dogs die during
this transportation route. </p>
<p>$400
including ~ $200 for one way flights to jeju island for two and car hire from
the main land to follow the truck with the dogs etc.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> Follow the dog meat trail
from the Vet/pet shelter/dog auction as well as abusive farms to market and/or
dog slaughterhouse. This requires hundreds of hours of stakeouts and is very
resource intensive. We will not be able to do this alone and will have to hire
other skilled investigators to do this. </p>
<p>~
$3000 for 2 investigators to work for a week each including all of their
expenses. They will also film during these visits. </p><p>UPDATE:- THIS MAY BE ABLE TO BE DONE BY SKILLED VOLUNTEERS AND THEREFORE REDUCE THE EXPENSE CONSIDERABLY.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> Independently conduct
covert surveillance of dog meat markets, restaurants, farms, and
slaughterhouses. Conduct interviews with relevant authorities, edit footage,
store footage, and write articles. ~ $6,000 (400 hours @$15 per hour)</p><p>UPDATE:- SOME OF THIS MAY BE ABLE TO BE DONE BY SKILLED VOLUNTEERS AND THEREFORE REDUCE THE EXPENSE CONSIDERABLY.<br/></p><p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">4.</b><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> Launch a survey on the
opinions of outsiders on the dog meat industry in Korea. This survey will need
1,000 participants and be done using random sampling. The exact methodology
would need to be worked out and we’d engage academic researchers and an
independent third party in order to maintain objectivity.</span><br/></p>
<p>~$2,000
if done on a budget and using volunteers to assist in gather the data. Of
course, we will try to get an academic to drive this survey for free but that
is unlikely.</p>
<p><b>5. </b>Forge working relationships
with key stakeholders, which are usually done by meeting them in person and
having meals or drinks together. We will NOT pay directly for information
(unless it is a prescribed photocopying fee or similar) as this often results in
sources giving information they think you want to hear rather than the truth.
This includes digging for dirt on specific members of the Korean police,
government, judges, food and livestock authorities, and other appropriate
authorities role in regulating (or not regulating) cruelty to animals and how
they are connected. We will need to forge working relationships with the
appropriate police, officials, and informants. We, however, would need to
pick up the tab if those stakeholders are in financial difficulties or feel
uncomfortable sharing the bills. It is a Korean custom that an older person or
those who made the invitation (which would be us) to pick up the tab.</p>
<p>~$500
if done on a budget. For the record, I don’t like this system, but it is
effective and saves time and money in the long term.</p>
<p><b>6.</b> Printing costs for
posters and information on the dog meat industry as well as blank DVDs and
cases.  </p>
<p>~$350++ </p>
<p><b>7.</b> Travel to and from the
main dog farm and areas. Transport is relatively cheap in Korea but we’d need
to do regular travel and sometimes hire a van. </p>
<p> ~$1,200.
(2 reporters on the move daily at around $10 per day each plus the hire of a
van for a week when required ~ $700 and the occasional taxi as uber has
not been shut down in Korea).</p>
<p><b>8.</b> Accommodation and food in
other areas for two reporters while investigating. We will stay at dodgy hotels
that cost around $40-$60 per night or even try to stay for free with contacts
if we can (anything to keep costs down). We will intermittently stay at
backpackers as well as these can be great sources of information. </p>
<p>~
$1,100 for 14 nights in a shared room with basic meals et cetera. </p>
<p><b>9.</b> Film translation and
subtitle development.</p>
<p>~$600
if $20 per hour for subtitle translation (when editing film).</p>
<p><b>10. </b>Equipment purchase:
Although we have our own equipment that we will use, we require some specific
cameras (that we don’t have) and an FPV drone to gather evidence. We also need
at least 5 eye-fi memory cards ($160 each) – we expect to encounter resistance
during our investigations and we need a system where whatever we film or
photograph immediately goes on the internet (i.e., if our cameras are
destroyed, stolen, or seized by the police their contents will already be
uploading to the internet). We also need specialist sound equipment. </p>
<p>-
$5,300 composed of: cameras and drone with extra batteries and gimbal $3,700;
Eye-fi cards $800; Sound equipment $800</p><p>UPDATE:- WE MAY BE ABLE TO HIRE SOME EQUIPMENT OR HAVE ITS USE DONATED THEREFORE CUTTING THE EXPENSE CONSIDERABLY.<br/></p>
<p><b>11.</b> Legal protection. We need
to hire a lawyer to mitigate against any lawsuits that arise from this
story. </p>
<p> ~
$2,500 if we cannot get someone to assist pro bono.</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><b>12.</b></span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> Scientific tests to determine the bacteria and antibiotic levels present in dogs and some vet bills (at material cost).  </span></p>

<p><b>TOTAL =</b>$24,250 plus fees of 9%+1% degree of error ($2,425)</p>
<p><b>Grand total =</b>$26,675</p><p><br/></p>
<h1>What else will we do?</h1>
<p>We’ve already exposed that slaughterhouses do
not differentiate between meat dogs and pet dogs (<a rel=""noopener nofollow""><span></span></a><a href=""http://www.koreaobserver.com/former-pets-slaughtered-for-dog-meat-across-korea-25566"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.koreaobserver.com/former-pets-slaughtered-for-dog-meat-across-korea-25566</a>).
NGO Coexistence for Animal Rights on Earth also shattered this myth
photographing several pet breed dogs in slaughterhouses with those bred for
meat. </p><p><b>WARNING - VIDEO EXTREMELY GRAPHIC &amp; SHOWS DOGS BEING KILLED</b></p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F-IqGLsy3VgY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D-IqGLsy3VgY%26feature%3Dyoutu.be&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F-IqGLsy3VgY%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><p>The
next step to this is exploring the number of pets that are taken to animal
shelters and how many are put down. We expect this number will be massive and
try to interview vets who acknowledge that they sell/donate former pets to the
dog slaughterhouses/auctions to avoid euthanising them.</p>
<p>Some
Koreans also argue that dog meat is consumed as a traditional cultural practice
– we will explore this and determine its validity. It is popular opinion that
Korean dog meat is good for your health – we will also investigate this using
food and bacteria analytical reports as well as interviews with the relevant
food associations.</p>
<p>There
are also dog tonics and medicines produced using dog as an ingredient – we will
identify if this is done lawfully and track those down who violate those laws.
We will also test the efficacy of these tonics and invite comments from doctors
and/or food scientists.</p>
<p>We
will also interview restaurant owners to determine if they know how the dogs
they are using as food are slaughtered and get their reactions. It is highly
probable that most know how the dogs are killed and do not care. This then
reinforces the need for the industry to be regulated, which would drive the
prices of the meat up and less people would consume it. This would be the first
step to reducing consumption and getting the industry banned.</p>
<p>We
also intend to expose the interconnection between some dog farms and dog
shelters. Animal activists have come across evidence that reveals a number of
dog shelter owners also run dog farms. This means that dogs rescued from other
meat farms, the streets, pounds, or surrendered to them end up back in dog
farms and will be killed for consumption. If we can prove this then it gives a
strong argument that shelters and dog farms need to be licensed on a national
register and regulated at the very least.</p><p>When we come across dog farms that are particularly cruel, we will inform the relevant authorities for follow up and pressure them to ensure they follow up. </p>
<h3></h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1348945/files/20150402060013-11070702_10155381003525133_234329203_o.jpg?1427979613"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><h3>Risks
and challenges</h3>
<p>1. Although we will try not to be noticed by corrupt authorities, they are likely to pressure us to drop the documentary and threaten us with illegal incarceration. This would only further enhance the quality of the documentary
and give international media exposure to a very cruel industry. If this occurs,
we will engage other media, animal rights, human rights, and legal rights groups from our
contact network to expose the South Korean legal industry for what it is. The
project will always go on!</p>
<p>2.
There is a risk that our technical equipment and memory cards are stolen or
smashed by perpetrators. That is why we will use eye-fi memory cards that auto
upload to a phone or laptop with dropbox. Thus footage can never be stolen or
destroyed even if our equipment is ceased or destroyed.</p>
<p>3.
Government officials refuse to engage with us or be interviewed. We will be
persistent and insistent. Where necessary, we will send gifts (as outlined in
the costing summary) or forge strategic partnerships to obtain
footage/documents via other non-traditional (or covert) means. If this in
ineffective, we will do stakeouts try to engage the official while they are
walking to their car, shopping, drinking at a bar, or even request a lady (a
hostess) at a business club (a place where Korean businessmen go to drink and
host meetings with female escorts) ask for the information from them.</p>
<p>4.
To complete this project well it will take at least 3 months but more likely be
achieved around the 6 month mark. This timeframe factors in several risks
including the possibility of encountering hostility from key stakeholders. This
is not the first time Tae-hoon and James have encountered these sorts of issues
and our experience as journalists provides us with the competency to use this
hostility to our advantage.</p>
<p>5.
We may get hacked and have our news site vandalised, which is probably the most
likely risk. We have already been hacked twice but we have improved security.
We have a backup of our site so that if our website is destroyed or taken
offline we can restore it without major difficulties. Also, we will store our research

The dog meat industry in South Korea is
exceptionally cruel, is not regulated, and laws for slaughtering dogs
inhumanely are not currently enforced. If you want evidence of just how cruel,
see the short video shot by undercover CARE workers and used by The Korea
Observer in an expose on former dog pets being killed by slaughter yards for
consumption:http://goo.gl/025cID. 
The Korea Observer  intends to do a complete expose of the dog meat
industry in South Korea. This includes engaging key political officials, dog
farmers, legal officials, animal welfare groups, dog meat restaurant owners,
police, judges, and who ever else is appropriate. Ideally, through a collective
effort, we would like our investigative work to prompt a series of actions that
lead to the end of dog meat farming and dog meat consumption in Korea. We will
aim for this utopian goal but it may not be feasible in the short term. 
At
the very least, The Korea Observer will interview officials and question why
they do not impose licensing conditions and strict regulations on the dog meat
industry to minimise the cruelty exhibited to dogs and former pets that are
often tortured prior to being killed, fed the remains of killed dogs, kept in
overcrowded, unsanitary conditions, and stacked on top of each other alive in
small cages while being transported to market.  
We
will show officials film we've captured, demonstrate that many Korean officials
are ashamed of the industry, and use statistics to show that the world looks
down on Korea due to their dog meat industry. UPDATE:- SOME OF THE WORK MAY BE ABLE TO BE DONE BY SKILLED VOLUNTEERS AND THEREFORE THE COST OF PRODUCTION WILL REDUCE CONSIDERABLY. In the interests of transparency: an animal activist and dog shelter owner in Korea has raised valid concerns about us purchasing equipment for this documentary and using some paid staff (i.e., not ALL volunteers). He also messaged several Facebook groups where we advertised the documentary strongly requesting no-one donate based on these concerns. I have addressed these concerns with him and offered the following:""I agree that if volunteers come forward we’ll utilise them thus reducing the expense but we need some highly skilled technical staff who are unable to volunteer their time. Leftover funds will be apportioned and donated to those who have volunteered their time and to animal welfare groups in Korea.""UPDATE:1. Koreandogs.orgA HUGE thank you to http://koreandogs.org/ who have donate $3500 for this documentary. We look forward to working with you now and in the future.2. A massive THANK YOU to those who have donated funds so far. Please do not forget to share this campaign on Facebook and via email!!!!!!If we don't get the 26K we will have to scale back what we were planning to do but we will still go ahead. The initial plan was to produce a professional documentary which would air in the US, Australia, and on various internet platforms. However, the TV networks only accept top quality documentaries shot (usually) with top quality equipment and professional editing. We will do our best to achieve what we can with whatever budget we get and hope that we get volunteers with technical skills and the use of equipment donated. [FYI - I used to have all the equipment required but was robbed and insurance did not cover us]. In summary, we will go ahead with the documentary if we only raise 10K, but it will be with less quality equipment, less technically skilled staff (i.e., volunteers), and it may not get as much exposure as we'd like it to].  We will still put 100% effort in and try our hardest!3. Thank to CARE [http://www.careanimalrights.org/] for the use of visuals, your great report, and other resources. It is through information sharing and solidarity that we will prevail.  4. Thank you to Rhett May [http://www.rhettmay.com/] for donating, with attribution and maintenance of copyright, his song Heaven or Hell.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cg2c1oipfWwRhett is a skilled artist with songs available on iTunes http://goo.gl/eb4wCP 5. Thank you to HSI [http://www.hsi.org.au/] for providing some footage of meat dogs who have been rescued and re-homed in the U.S. This reduces the personal costs associated with flying to the U.S., sourcing interviews, and shooting those interviews ourselves. Thank you again!  
The Online Media Company – what we’ve done so far 
The
Korea Observer is a relatively new media start-up that was inspired by Tae-hoon
Lee after he witnessed the corruption and malpractice of media moguls in South
Korea. “I was really ashamed of collecting pay checks for writing pro-government
articles and paid content while working for Arirang TV and the Korea Times,”
Lee Tae-hoon, publisher at the Korea Observer said. 
James
Hyams joined as the deputy managing editor late 2014 following Lee Tae-hoon’s
great work. He liked the notion of providing “A Voice for the Voiceless” and
thinks that The Korea Observer can be the best English news service in South
Korea with time, hard work, and enough resources. 
Since
its inception in Feb 2013, The Korea Observer has reported news that would
otherwise be ignored with the motto: “A Voice for the Voiceless.” The topics
we’ve covered include the exclusion of specific races from jobs and bars,
corporate malpractice and corruption, human rights abuses, LGBT rejection and
discrimination, animal cruelty including the dog meat industry, child abuse in
kindergartens, immigration and deportation issues, expat equality and rights,
and so on. 
 Some
notable publications include Boeing’s bribery of journalists with sexual
entertainment, a Korean bar’s ban of Africans based on fears of Ebola, and the
exposing the dog meat industry in South Korea to expats. We’ve also broken
numerous stories, including human rights abuses by the Miss Asia Pacific World
contest, Korea’s denial of entry to ‘pickup artist’ Julien Blanc, and an
African American’s rejection for job interviews for being black in Korea. 
The
Korea Observer was accepted into Google News early 2015. We are now competing
with mainstream English speaking press in Korea on a zero dollar budget.
Imagine what we could do with their massive budgets!  

The
people behind the company 
Tae-hoon
and James Hyams volunteer their time. Tae-hoon has not had a wage since
February 2013. 
James
is a social worker in Australia and this pays the bills. He works remotely for
The Korea Observer. Without funding, we are severely limited to what we can do
with The Korea Observer. 
Tae-hoon Lee
Lee Tae-hoon founded The Korea Observer in
hopes of reporting news that would otherwise be ignored by the mainstream media
in Korea. He quit Arirang TV after witnessing its senior staff officials
embezzle money. Senior staff created accounts in false names and skimmed money
from payments to contract workers. Lee later exposed those responsible in order
to hold them accountable (http://bit.ly/1GK8Nfs). 
Lee
left the Korea Times after witnessing the paper running advertorials without
any mention of them being paid content and generating revenues under the excuse
of helping multicultural children and others in need of help.
James Hyams 
James
started working as a social worker in 2006 but realized that systemic and
cognitive change is required to improve conditions for those with limited
political and financial power. Despite knowing that journalism is withering and
an income is not guaranteed, James went back to university and studied
journalism, while still working as a social worker, with the hope that he could
expose corporate and political power abuses, corruption, human rights abuse,
animal cruelty cases, enhance opportunities for the less fortunate, and
positively influence change within society. This is a utopian dream that is
slowly being realized with The Korea Observer. 

Why we
need you 
 Like
many media start-ups, we are faced with the daily challenge of publishing
articles without any resources. As noted above, some of our stories have been
quality but some are b-grade pieces that we are not proud of. We have
underutilized skills and a strong desire to regain our roots in investigative
journalism but we need your help to really kickstart major investigations into
topics that will be of international interest. With your support, we intend to
be an active watchdog over Korea and international Korean companies such as
Samsung, LG, Hyundai, Kia, Daewoo, Korean Air, Fila (clothing – yes it is Korea
owned), Posco, SK, Lotte, and so on. 
Prior
to investigating these large companies, we are asking for financial assistance
to enable us to expose the dog meat industry in South Korea. As we know, dog
meat is openly consumed in South Korea despite it being a developed, first
world country. According to animal welfare group CARE the
dog meat industry is massive. The Korean Statistics Information Service
includes dog farming in the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Census. In 2010
they reported 892,820 dogs in 100,191 farms. All of these dogs, plus many dogs
in shelters, pounds, and former pets will end up as food in restaurants or
homes according to many animal welfare groups including CARE, HSI, Nami Kim, and other off-the-record groups. 

The above map comes from a CARE report.The industry is not regulated and prosecutions
for animal rights abuses are very rare. The only arrests for illegally hanging
dogs, that we are aware of, occurred after The Korea Observer covered a story
where there was photographic evidence of a Jindo dog being hung by the neck and
killed by two migrants (http://goo.gl/1xh5Ck). The
Korea Observer followed up and Animal rights activists reported this to the
police who tracked down and arrested the main perpetrator (http://goo.gl/1Uy3mG). This matter is before the
courts. Cases, such as this, can often be dismissed by judges without rational
discussion. The onus is usually on the prosecutor to demonstrate that the dog
was a companion dog (i.e., a pet) at the time of slaughter. We
intend to explore why these laws are antiquated and behind the rest of the OECD
countries. We intend to obtain footage of slaughterhouses hanging dogs and
provide it to the police and judges for insight into why prosecution is so rare
and follow up with law groups to determine the best action to create conditions
where judges feel compelled to prosecute offenders. 
In CARE's full report on the dog industry, they demonstrate that pet auction houses (i.e.,
pet stores) also provide live dogs to slaughterhouses. A pet auction house in
Cheonan holds around 200 dogs including Huskies, Labradors, Golden Retrievers,
Cocker Spaniels, and Grey Hounds. “This is the biggest meat auction market in
South Korea. Ninety percent of the sales here are for meat,” the owner said to CARE investigators.
The Korea Observer will expose this link and the perpetrators. 
The above photo is a screenshot from a STOP IT video courtesy of CARE.When
transporting the dogs, it is common practice for farmers to squash as many live
dogs into one cage as possible as shown in the STOP IT footage obtained from CARE. Most of the time dogs are stacked on top of
each other and do not have enough room to stand up. “Many dogs die in the
summer during transport,” one dog farmer said to investigators. The Korea Observer will follow these farmers to
document how the dogs are mistreated and follow up with officials to determine
if laws are being broken. If it is not illegal, we will question why! 
There
are also unconfirmed claims that certain vets are providing companion dogs,
scheduled to be put down, to slaughterhouses in exchange for remuneration. We
will investigate these claims and expose those that cooperate in this practice. 
There
are also locals and expats that covertly break into slaughterhouses, kill
shelters, and dog farms that torture animals, and steal (rescue) the dogs prior to
slaughter. These dogs are taken to the vet, given treatment, fed, given foster
homes, and then re-homed locally or internationally. The activists engaged in
these practices have devoted their lifesavings to saving and re-homing
suffering dogs bound for slaughter. Many have sold all their assets, live a
very basic life with only bare essentials to survive, and put all of their
resources into saving dogs. Their stories need to be told! They also courier
some of these dogs over the US for adoption establishing an international dog
saving network, which we also intend to visually document. 
The
Korea Observer has been communicating with dog welfare activists since late
2014 to understand the industry and how best to bring about change. We intend
to investigate this industry in its entirety but require funds to do that. The
final product will be written stories with photographs and a gonzo-style
documentary. James will also write an eBook about the investigation. 
What the funds will
specifically be used for
1. Following the dog meat
trail from Jeju Island to the mainland. Dogs are transported to the South
Korean peninsula from famous Jeju Island twice a week despite representatives
of the Port Development Division in Jeju saying, “Dogs are never transported to
the mainland by boat.” This is the most disturbing method of transportation. We
want to document it in full and interview the transporter. Many dogs die during
this transportation route. 
$400
including ~ $200 for one way flights to jeju island for two and car hire from
the main land to follow the truck with the dogs etc.
2. Follow the dog meat trail
from the Vet/pet shelter/dog auction as well as abusive farms to market and/or
dog slaughterhouse. This requires hundreds of hours of stakeouts and is very
resource intensive. We will not be able to do this alone and will have to hire
other skilled investigators to do this. 
~
$3000 for 2 investigators to work for a week each including all of their
expenses. They will also film during these visits. UPDATE:- THIS MAY BE ABLE TO BE DONE BY SKILLED VOLUNTEERS AND THEREFORE REDUCE THE EXPENSE CONSIDERABLY.
3. Independently conduct
covert surveillance of dog meat markets, restaurants, farms, and
slaughterhouses. Conduct interviews with relevant authorities, edit footage,
store footage, and write articles. ~ $6,000 (400 hours @$15 per hour)UPDATE:- SOME OF THIS MAY BE ABLE TO BE DONE BY SKILLED VOLUNTEERS AND THEREFORE REDUCE THE EXPENSE CONSIDERABLY.4. Launch a survey on the
opinions of outsiders on the dog meat industry in Korea. This survey will need
1,000 participants and be done using random sampling. The exact methodology
would need to be worked out and we’d engage academic researchers and an
independent third party in order to maintain objectivity.
~$2,000
if done on a budget and using volunteers to assist in gather the data. Of
course, we will try to get an academic to drive this survey for free but that
is unlikely.
5. Forge working relationships
with key stakeholders, which are usually done by meeting them in person and
having meals or drinks together. We will NOT pay directly for information
(unless it is a prescribed photocopying fee or similar) as this often results in
sources giving information they think you want to hear rather than the truth.
This includes digging for dirt on specific members of the Korean police,
government, judges, food and livestock authorities, and other appropriate
authorities role in regulating (or not regulating) cruelty to animals and how
they are connected. We will need to forge working relationships with the
appropriate police, officials, and informants. We, however, would need to
pick up the tab if those stakeholders are in financial difficulties or feel
uncomfortable sharing the bills. It is a Korean custom that an older person or
those who made the invitation (which would be us) to pick up the tab.
~$500
if done on a budget. For the record, I don’t like this system, but it is
effective and saves time and money in the long term.
6. Printing costs for
posters and information on the dog meat industry as well as blank DVDs and
cases.  
~$350++ 
7. Travel to and from the
main dog farm and areas. Transport is relatively cheap in Korea but we’d need
to do regular travel and sometimes hire a van. 
 ~$1,200.
(2 reporters on the move daily at around $10 per day each plus the hire of a
van for a week when required ~ $700 and the occasional taxi as uber has
not been shut down in Korea).
8. Accommodation and food in
other areas for two reporters while investigating. We will stay at dodgy hotels
that cost around $40-$60 per night or even try to stay for free with contacts
if we can (anything to keep costs down). We will intermittently stay at
backpackers as well as these can be great sources of information. 
~
$1,100 for 14 nights in a shared room with basic meals et cetera. 
9. Film translation and
subtitle development.
~$600
if $20 per hour for subtitle translation (when editing film).
10. Equipment purchase:
Although we have our own equipment that we will use, we require some specific
cameras (that we don’t have) and an FPV drone to gather evidence. We also need
at least 5 eye-fi memory cards ($160 each) – we expect to encounter resistance
during our investigations and we need a system where whatever we film or
photograph immediately goes on the internet (i.e., if our cameras are
destroyed, stolen, or seized by the police their contents will already be
uploading to the internet). We also need specialist sound equipment. 
-
$5,300 composed of: cameras and drone with extra batteries and gimbal $3,700;
Eye-fi cards $800; Sound equipment $800UPDATE:- WE MAY BE ABLE TO HIRE SOME EQUIPMENT OR HAVE ITS USE DONATED THEREFORE CUTTING THE EXPENSE CONSIDERABLY.
11. Legal protection. We need
to hire a lawyer to mitigate against any lawsuits that arise from this
story. 
 ~
$2,500 if we cannot get someone to assist pro bono.12. Scientific tests to determine the bacteria and antibiotic levels present in dogs and some vet bills (at material cost).  
 ~$1,300 
TOTAL =$24,250 plus fees of 9%+1% degree of error ($2,425)
Grand total =$26,675
What else will we do?
We’ve already exposed that slaughterhouses do
not differentiate between meat dogs and pet dogs (http://www.koreaobserver.com/former-pets-slaughtered-for-dog-meat-across-korea-25566).
NGO Coexistence for Animal Rights on Earth also shattered this myth
photographing several pet breed dogs in slaughterhouses with those bred for
meat. WARNING - VIDEO EXTREMELY GRAPHIC & SHOWS DOGS BEING KILLED
The
next step to this is exploring the number of pets that are taken to animal
shelters and how many are put down. We expect this number will be massive and
try to interview vets who acknowledge that they sell/donate former pets to the
dog slaughterhouses/auctions to avoid euthanising them.
Some
Koreans also argue that dog meat is consumed as a traditional cultural practice
– we will explore this and determine its validity. It is popular opinion that
Korean dog meat is good for your health – we will also investigate this using
food and bacteria analytical reports as well as interviews with the relevant
food associations.
There
are also dog tonics and medicines produced using dog as an ingredient – we will
identify if this is done lawfully and track those down who violate those laws.
We will also test the efficacy of these tonics and invite comments from doctors
and/or food scientists.
We
will also interview restaurant owners to determine if they know how the dogs
they are using as food are slaughtered and get their reactions. It is highly
probable that most know how the dogs are killed and do not care. This then
reinforces the need for the industry to be regulated, which would drive the
prices of the meat up and less people would consume it. This would be the first
step to reducing consumption and getting the industry banned.
We
also intend to expose the interconnection between some dog farms and dog
shelters. Animal activists have come across evidence that reveals a number of
dog shelter owners also run dog farms. This means that dogs rescued from other
meat farms, the streets, pounds, or surrendered to them end up back in dog
farms and will be killed for consumption. If we can prove this then it gives a
strong argument that shelters and dog farms need to be licensed on a national
register and regulated at the very least.When we come across dog farms that are particularly cruel, we will inform the relevant authorities for follow up and pressure them to ensure they follow up. 
Risks
and challenges
1. Although we will try not to be noticed by corrupt authorities, they are likely to pressure us to drop the documentary and threaten us with illegal incarceration. This would only further enhance the quality of the documentary
and give international media exposure to a very cruel industry. If this occurs,
we will engage other media, animal rights, human rights, and legal rights groups from our
contact network to expose the South Korean legal industry for what it is. The
project will always go on!
2.
There is a risk that our technical equipment and memory cards are stolen or
smashed by perpetrators. That is why we will use eye-fi memory cards that auto
upload to a phone or laptop with dropbox. Thus footage can never be stolen or
destroyed even if our equipment is ceased or destroyed.
3.
Government officials refuse to engage with us or be interviewed. We will be
persistent and insistent. Where necessary, we will send gifts (as outlined in
the costing summary) or forge strategic partnerships to obtain
footage/documents via other non-traditional (or covert) means. If this in
ineffective, we will do stakeouts try to engage the official while they are
walking to their car, shopping, drinking at a bar, or even request a lady (a
hostess) at a business club (a place where Korean businessmen go to drink and
host meetings with female escorts) ask for the information from them.
4.
To complete this project well it will take at least 3 months but more likely be
achieved around the 6 month mark. This timeframe factors in several risks
including the possibility of encountering hostility from key stakeholders. This
is not the first time Tae-hoon and James have encountered these sorts of issues
and our experience as journalists provides us with the competency to use this
hostility to our advantage.
5.
We may get hacked and have our news site vandalised, which is probably the most
likely risk. We have already been hacked twice but we have improved security.
We have a backup of our site so that if our website is destroyed or taken
offline we can restore it without major difficulties. Also, we will store our research
on back-up hard drives to ensure we always have a master copy.",5.0,1,"5 Campaigns

We wanna start a conversation. Everyone, well not everyone, but you know, deals with these fees and we never talk about it. If we talk about it, maybe they will FUCKINNNN change.......
 

Risks & Challenges
Making a film is expensive, paying a crew is expensive, ESPECIALLY post production (though that's for REALLY good reason, ask us about our horror stories sometime), marketing is expensive...and food is expensive (lbr that is the most important part anyway, again, we ARE Jews.)
We want the film to look good, sound good, be something we can be proud of (again, ask about our horror stories), and we want to share it with as many people as we can ✨ ✨ 
 

Other Ways You Can Help
Share this! Make posts about our film! Tell all your friends! Bug your parents for money (yes, including you Millennials). Tell your film producer uncle to fund us.... ✨ ✨ this isn't a joke✨ ✨ 
Get creative, anything works, just make sure to tag us @daniellesilverstone, @ariella.elm, and @overdraftfilm, we'll share it on the film's socials!
We love y'all! Let's make movie magic! ✨ ✨",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

In the fall of 2018, Sarah moved to Austin to continue her growth as a cinematographer and a female filmmaker.  She currently works with Austin Film Society as a part of their youth education Film Club program, is a co-founder of The Femme House ATX, and freelances.</p>

<p>Conan is an only child, who is treated like royalty by his parents, especially his Papa and nothing changes on the day of his birthday. He is promised the biggest present of them all, but he isn't allowed to open it until his party. He decides to try and find his present, under his alias 'Special Agent Conan', but ends up discovering something much more eye-opening that dramatically changes his life forever.</p>

<h2>THE NAME</h2>
<p>It was difficult to name this film as we wanted to create a name that wouldn't give away the story, but would entice people to it. We came up with Kaleidoscope after watching the film and seeing Conan picking up one, that's when we thought about how the a Kaleidoscope is made up of a lot of colours, and so is our story.</p>

<h3>THE IMPORTANCE OF OUR FILM</h3>
<p>This short film has themes of family, trust, love and dishonour, all of which are so important to society today. It is also a film that centres around domestic abuse and the lies that families face behind closed doors, away from society. For us, domestic abuse is an important subject to be talking about and, we know many films centre around the subject, but we believe that telling the story from the child's perspective, almost like an adventure film, creates more tension as we move to create a resolution.</p>

Writing since she was five years old, Stuti is currently working on a feature length fantasy drama, and like our film, it’s main focus is around children. She is also writing a TV pilot and several shorts at the moment.



Tania wanted to do something adventurous and ground breaking that she could embrace, feeling passionate about and grow with.  In time honoured fashion, she started out as a assistant in the camera dept, one day she got a call asking if she'd DP a 16mm film starring Brian Blessed.  Since then she's shot Commercials, Documentaries and Award Winning Narrative Short Film Drama, she is a proud to be a member of GBCT & BAFTA Crew.

What We Need & What You Get
We are looking for £3000 to be able to pay for our post-production of the film, with excellent sound design, music composition and colour grading to go with our cut of the film. No film is complete without any of these and we don't want to release this film to the world without completing the film first.
Our Post-Production Team:

Bringing the story to life through the edit, Rob Maxwell is working hard with director, Nicole Pott, to get this film onto the big screen. Rob and Nicole have worked together on numerous occasions and in early 2018, became business partners together at Sonder Pictures Ltd. Rob has edited numerous projects, included his own with his production company, Sic Infit, and recently a horror feature film.

Richard Collins is a fantastic composer, who has worked on various projects over his career. He has worked with Nicole on two projects 'Rambling On', of which he was nominated for Best Score at The Monkey Bread Tree Film Festival and the crowdfunder for 'Bonnie'. He is working to build a fantastic score for this short film that will be really emotive!

On top of this, we will be putting some money towards our film festival campaign as we hit the big festivals i.e. Atlanta, Cannes, Athens, San Luis.

If we don't reach our goal, we will use the money towards the costs, whilst we continue to raise a further finishing fund. 
Should you wish to contribute to our film, we will ship ALL perks within 45 days of the specified date on the perks. If you do not receive notification that your gift has been sent, you may ask for your money back.

THE IMPORTANCE OF OUR FILM
This short film has themes of family, trust, love and dishonour, all of which are so important to society today. It is also a film that centres around domestic abuse and the lies that families face behind closed doors, away from society. For us, domestic abuse is an important subject to be talking about and, we know many films centre around the subject, but we believe that telling the story from the child's perspective, almost like an adventure film, creates more tension as we move to create a resolution.
We would be extremely grateful if you are able to help us push this message out by donating to our film.
DOMESTIC ABUSE CHARITIES
Domestic abuse is an important thing to talk about, especially for children who are involved mentally or physically, and we want to support charities that work hard to help children in those situations.
We are donating 10% of all the funds that we make from this campaign to NSPCC because we believe children deserve a better chance at happiness in their life.",17.0,3,"2 Campaigns

<p>""Nice To Meet You All""  is a short documentary that tells the story of <i>Bri</i>, a woman with Dissociative Identity Disorder, who has survived human trafficking rings across America and the UK.   The film follows her in her everyday life, alongside five of her sixty-five ""alters"" - the different personalities she has because of D.I.D. </p>

<h3>Message from the Director</h3>
<p>My Mom was (and still is) a music teacher, and growing up my three siblings and I were constantly surrounded by music. The four of us all became musicians ourselves, and one of my sisters even became a music teacher, too. I know exactly how music education can affect a student, but more importantly, how that music teacher can affect them. </p>
<p>My name is Michael D. Smith, or Mikey for short. I'm the writer and director of <i>Skipping A Beat</i>. This Fall, I'm going to be a senior at Montclair State University, and I chose to focus my senior thesis film on something that felt personal to me. I've been impacted by all of the music teachers in my life, as well as my filmmaking teachers (yes... even from high school). To be blunt, we've all had at least one teacher who impacted us profoundly. </p>
<p>However, I can't make this film happen alone. With your contributions, we'll be able to bring <i>Skipping A Beat</i> to life. Here's how...</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Budget Breakdown</h3>
<p>Our goal is $2,250.00! Each of your kind contributions will be rewarded with a perk (those can be checked out below). Here's a breakdown of exactly where your money will be going:</p>
<ul>
<li>$105 - Travel for cast and crew<ul><li>Some of our cast will be taking the train to get to the set every day, and we'd like to cover these costs for them as it can quickly add up! This section will also cover public transportation for our crew members who are traveling long distances. </li></ul>
</li>
<li>$650 - Set locations <ul><li>Filming within a high school definitely comes with some costs! After deligating the days and times we need to be there, and arranging the permits, $650 is the apprporiate amount to pay for our locations! </li></ul>
</li>
<li>$600 - Production and set design<ul><li>Although we are filming in a high school that has school supplies, there's still a lot that goes into designing a set. This money will allow our Production Designer to make it all look much more real and convincing! There is also a scene within a hospital room that we need to design. </li></ul>

My Mom was (and still is) a music teacher, and growing up my three siblings and I were constantly surrounded by music. The four of us all became musicians ourselves, and one of my sisters even became a music teacher, too. I know exactly how music education can affect a student, but more importantly, how that music teacher can affect them. 
My name is Michael D. Smith, or Mikey for short. I'm the writer and director of Skipping A Beat. This Fall, I'm going to be a senior at Montclair State University, and I chose to focus my senior thesis film on something that felt personal to me. I've been impacted by all of the music teachers in my life, as well as my filmmaking teachers (yes... even from high school). To be blunt, we've all had at least one teacher who impacted us profoundly. 
However, I can't make this film happen alone. With your contributions, we'll be able to bring Skipping A Beat to life. Here's how...
 

Budget Breakdown
Our goal is $2,250.00! Each of your kind contributions will be rewarded with a perk (those can be checked out below). Here's a breakdown of exactly where your money will be going:

$105 - Travel for cast and crewSome of our cast will be taking the train to get to the set every day, and we'd like to cover these costs for them as it can quickly add up! This section will also cover public transportation for our crew members who are traveling long distances. 

$650 - Set locations Filming within a high school definitely comes with some costs! After deligating the days and times we need to be there, and arranging the permits, $650 is the apprporiate amount to pay for our locations! 

$600 - Production and set designAlthough we are filming in a high school that has school supplies, there's still a lot that goes into designing a set. This money will allow our Production Designer to make it all look much more real and convincing! There is also a scene within a hospital room that we need to design. 

$145 - Hair, makeup, and costumesOur actors have to look the part! 

$500 - Camera equipmentTo make the film look the best that it can be, we have to rent additional lenses. This is definitely not cheap, but a decision we're happy to dedicate some of our campaign to. We want Skipping A Beat to be at its full potential!

$200 - Gear transportationGetting the gear to and from the set is always a hassle, and can be a safety issue if not handled properly. Renting a truck to hold all of the gear will ensure its safety and ours. 


 
Risks & Challenges
Our biggest challenges really stem from the quality that we want to emulate on the screen. With the gear provided by Montclair State University, we are able to get a decent product using our collective creative minds. But we want more. We want to make an excellent product that I can confidently end my collegiate career with.

I know a lot of people and can call in some solids to get good deals, but I need to pay people for their time and expertise.*Studio rental, props, set design - we’re bound to outgrow my home studio pretty quickly! *Actors, on-camera talent, voice overs - dramatic recreations, etc. Post-Production, the most important and most often overlooked part of film making:*Transcription of interviews - we’ll be recording a LOT of interviews, and someone has to write that all down.*Logging of footage - keeping track of everything we shoot, and where it fits into the film (or Director’s cut).*Stock footage and production music*Graphics and animations - if I have ONE WISH we’ll be able to start our movie with something that tells the history of racism in America like this COULD YOU IMAGINE THAT? Distribution, releasing the film into the wild:*Duplication - blu-ray is still a thing!*Compression for internet usage People are in pain.  People are dying, and maybe we can help.I don’t have any illusions that one documentary is going to fix all our problems. But if we can manage to open one person’s mind or spark some new conversations, our work will be done. Save one person, save the world!  Risks & Challenges:We think the time for this story is now, and we are committed to making the best film we can as quickly as possible. That said, documentary is an art, not an exact science, and there could be some bumps along the way. If production obstacles cause delays, that could mean that we get the film out to you, our backers, later than anticipated. However, we’ll be pumping out content all along the way. The protests are going, the election is four months, and unarmed black people are still getting murdered by the police. Now is not the time for silence! Please support this project if you can, and even if you can’t: Please signal boost!",5.0,2,"1 Campaign

<p>A recent breakup has him on edge, but he's a lover at heart. <strong>MILO</strong> is a boyish character who's in his beginning stages of manhood. He is a little naive and irrational sometimes, but his youth really breathes life into the story. Watching him fail and get into sticky situations really makes us laugh and reminds us of our silly youthful mistakes. He's talented depending on who you ask, but most importantly, Milo is a risk taker. He's making this documentary to show the world the key to love, but really, it's a coping mechanism for him to visit these couple who he thinks can help show him what love truly means.</p>

<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>This film should start a conversation around relationships. Various opinions are thrown around on what life and relationships should look like, but who’s to say who’s formula is correct. Different strokes for different folks. What may work for you won’t work for others, especially in a setting as intimate as a marriage. To think of us human beings as so simple that there's only one way a marriage should work greatly undermines the complexities of the individual. Surface level topics are easy to control and make rules for, but there’s nothing shallow about love. That’s for sure.</p>
<p>In all honesty, the comedy genre is sort of dying. You see it. I see it. We all know it's true. If I could make any other genre of film, I would, but I can't. God gave me the voice of comedy, and I have to use my gift to improve the world in any way I can. This filmmaking journey is taking me places I never thought I could go, but I can never do it without the support of others. Together, we can be a reviving force to the comedy genre.</p>

In all honesty, the comedy genre is sort of dying. You see it. I see it. We all know it's true. If I could make any other genre of film, I would, but I can't. God gave me the voice of comedy, and I have to use my gift to improve the world in any way I can. This filmmaking journey is taking me places I never thought I could go, but I can never do it without the support of others. Together, we can be a reviving force to the comedy genre.

Welcome to the Wilbur crowdfunding page! We are a group of third year students embarking on our Final Major Project. 
Wilbur follows an elderly man who struggles with developing dementia. Having recently lost his wife, he continues his day to day life with the aid of his daughter, until one day she doesn’t arrive. Due to the nature of his condition, he quickly forgets that she was meant to be coming in the first place and goes about his day with difficulty.
Our group have decided to make this film because so many lives are affected by Alzheimer's and dementia. However, the cases we have known often involve someone who can rely on family or friends to look out for them... but what about the people who are left without such a person? 
We want to raise awareness that some people are oblivious to the fact that they may need care and as a result, do not speak out. We also wish to draw attention to the value of carers and the importance of family support to the elderly.
 

From The Director
My crew and I are striving to create the best work of our careers and this drive is what has inspired us to keep going- even when times are so uncertain. We have a need to tell this story as the loneliness of frailty and old age continues to be a serious issue regardless of what else is going on in the world.
It has been a difficult year for everyone, but with your support we will be able to get our message out there and spread awareness of the issues surrounding Dementia.
 

Where's My Money Going?
We aim to raise £2000 which will support us in paying for: location, actors, catering, production, design, travel and, hopefully, a fundraiser screening event in May 2021. If we can reach our goal, this will allow us to access locations, actors and props that are in keeping with the story and mood of the film.
We would be immensely grateful if you would be able to donate to our appeal, however there are other options if you are unable to do so (see below).
In addition we do have some perks available if you wish to donate a set amount.


Risks & Challenges
As I'm sure you're aware, the pandemic has had an affect on the operations of many things. However we are determined to meet our goal of filming in the Spring. We will adhere to the COVID guidelines throughout the process of filming: social distancing, wearing masks, etc.. 
We already are in contact with a location that are willing to let us film, which we are very happy about (as this is one of the hardest things to find in the current climate).

<h3>Join us and become a part of 'Thieves In The Night'! </h3>
<p>‘Thieves In The Night’ is an intense thriller with an element of dark humor. </p>
<p>One of the goals of this film is to make every character interesting and relatable - the family and the thieves alike. The viewers will find themselves rooting for different characters. The audience will be fully invested in the characters, so the inevitable consequences will hit them even harder.</p>
<p>We love movies that are suspenseful, but also have a sense of humor. If we can have a laugh from time to time in a serious suspenseful film, we had a good time at the movies.  </p>
<p>We deliberately chose a one location setting and a limited cast, trapped together, so we can explore these characters and also keep the production costs low.</p>
<p>We kept the page count under one hundred to maintain a fast pace, to avoid fillers and keep the audience on the edge of their seats. The script already won an award for best thriller.</p>
<p>If you like this concept of a home invasion thriller with a touch of Tarantino/Cohen Brothers and a bit of Spaghetti Western sprinkled over it, this is for you.</p>
<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>After a botched heist, three thieves break into a supposedly empty house to wait out the night. When they discover a family inside, one wants to get rid of the witnesses, one has an eye for the teenage daughter and one tries to get everyone safely through the night. But the biggest threat is yet to arrive ...</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>WELCOME TO THE GAYEST PLACE ON EARTH</strong> follows the history and legacy of Parliament House, one of the most iconic gay nightclubs in America.</p>
<p>For any LGBTQ+ person living in central Florida, Parliament House has been a place where generations of queer-identifying people could find entertainment and community without the prejudices of the outside world. With a hotel, restaurant, pool, sit-down theatre, several bars, lakefront views, extravagant sets and more extravagent drag shows, Parliament House's original location was a premiere gay destination. Unfortunately, in November of 2020, the original location of 45+ years was shut down and demolished. While Parliament House is, fortunately, making its comeback in downtown Orlando, its initial closure signals a decline in safe nightlife for queer-identifying people across the country. </p>
<p>This documentary will be told through personal interviews, archival media, and cinematic dramatizations.</p>

<p>As part of Lightup Shoebox Productions, the producers/directors (and romantic partners) Clark Levi and Joshua C. Thomas are queer filmmakers and theatre artists from central Florida who strive to tell culturally diverse and inclusive stories.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Chainsaw Sally is a beloved indie-horror icon, who, as it would seem, is not quite done.  I'm JimmyO Burril and I, along with my wife April created Chainsaw Sally in the early 2000's.  The film Chainsaw Sally is out around the world.  We then decided to make a web series... before there was really such a thing.  Netflix and other streaming services were not streaming yet.  We came up with The Chainsaw Sally Show, which had two successful seasons.  Well, it's time to let Sally do her thing once more.  If you don't know Sally, was my answer to the question : What if Bruce Wayne was female, poor, and had no guidance what so ever.  That is Sally in a nutshell.   An unhinged,  five foot 3, vengeance machine.  Her idea of right and wrong may be a tad askew, but her chainsaw will sort it out.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are hoping to raise as close to $20,000 as we can. Season 1 was done for almost no money.  All out of pocket.  Season 2 we made for $10,000 and the quality was very nice.  We would like to up the game as much as we can for actors, crew, equipment, and.... let's not forget effects.  Oh yes, there will be blood.   The more, the better.  It's that simple.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Season 3 of the Chainsaw Sally Show is really being made on demand from the many fans around the world.  We are and have always been outsiders of the film industry.  We are punk rock, grind house lovers and just don't seem to fit with in the ""Fraternity"" as Herschell Gordon Lewis would call it.  We have been called the ""First Family of Indie Horror"" which was the best and favorite quote from any review.  This is a labor of love for us.... and we plan to give the Sally fans exactly the show they want.  A little horror / a little comedy / a lot of blood. </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

Even if we do not meet our goal, your contribution will still be very beneficial to the video. Your money will go towards the most essential items first! Risks & ChallengesWe have aimed to minimize our risk and challenges the best we can by making sure to take time to tediously plan every stage of the process. We have worked hard to locate all the items on our list and know the exact cost of the needed costs for our resources. With that said, we acknowledge things don't always go as planned so we have taken extra time to assess challenges we may face. Here are some things we have considered possible challenges:
Obtaining the needed extras for scenes that require 40+ people.
Transporting all the materials and crew to various set locations.
Due to a tight schedule, we are limited on time so we have only one day to reshoot any mistakes.
COVID-19 has increased costs for some resources, meaning that our resources are limited and access to some needed resources is largely based on funds available.

<p>An exciting tense social thriller that explores microaggressions and the responses it causes.</p>
<p><strong>Synopsis</strong></p>
<p>Keon is a bright young black man that deals with daily microaggressions from a local police officer and co-workers at his internship. His silent anger continues to boil until he gets an unknown caller buzzing his phone who relates to Keon until a casual conversation quickly turns into a dangerous situation when it’s revealed that the caller has a sniper trained on Keon and his co-workers. He forces Keon to make a choice that will define him forever.</p>
<p><strong>Who We Are</strong></p>
<p>We are a group of students in Vancouver Film School in the Film Production program who want to develop and share this story with people to spark a discussion about microaggressions for our final project: Words, the weight that people get them, and the reaction it causes.</p>
<p>We have a flexible goal of $3,000.00 that will go towards upping the production value of this film, as well as securing locations and production design. We have a variety of perks, including pdfs of the script, digital screener of the film, production binder, Director's Commentary, and more.</p>

<p>Making movies is always a challenge, but we are hardworking passionate students with the support of our teachers who are film industry professionals.</p>

<h2>Moe</h2>
<p><i>Short Film: Runtime 15-20min</i></p>
<p><i>Directed By: Carson Rhodes</i></p>
<p><i>Coming: December 1st, 2021</i></p>
<p><i>Format: Digital/Festival release, up to 6k, Widescreen, 5.1 Surround Sound.</i></p>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Moe is a story about a devoted father who will do anything to find his young daughter who is missing in the woods. After losing his wife to an illness not 2 years prior, the last thing he wants is to lose another part of his family. After an accidental fire displaces his 6-year-old daughter, Anna, it's up to this hunter trapper to track her down. Follow Moe as he treks horseback through a night filled with dangerous mountain ranges and forests searching for his beloved daughter. </p>
<p>As the director, I think one of the greatest underlying themes of this film is the concept of giving up what is outside of our control. Now, giving up in any form or fashion is definitely not a story told very often for obvious reasons, but I don't think we should shy away from a story like that. I believe it is a story worth telling. Portraying a narrative that is told less often means we get new opportunities to display powerful, captivating stories in ways that people haven't experienced before. This very beneficial lesson is cleverly interwoven in the story of Moe.</p>
<p>From my perspective, the concept of giving up is this remarkable mystery that I don't understand. There almost seems to be a spiritual aspect in finding the things you're looking for just as soon as you stop looking for them. This strange concept is something I have observed with lost keys, cellphones, and even the simple things of life. In my experience, I have even seen some of the deepest lessons of life learned this way. The notion of letting go of control is something that audiences from all over the world can relate to, and it is a narrative that I am passionate about expressing through the story of Moe.</p>

<h3>The Crew</h3>
<p>Our crew is built up of a tight-knit community of talented individuals and students. The film is directed by Carson Rhodes. Edited by the skilled Will Vail. Our director of photography Connor Munch. Music by the amazing Kanoa Wolfe-Doblin. Additional VFX by Mutiny FX. And some more incredibly talented individuals working with Sound mixing, Arri lights, Steadicam, plenty of c-stands and grip tape, practical VFX, Incredible locations, and the Red Komodo 6k Camera.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This project is my senior film to complete my degree and finish college, but it's also a film I'm passionate about. Like most passion projects they lack funds. We've decided that now is the best time to do the project, and we have most of it together. All we need now is the funds to reimburse our progress. This film is going to be made regardless of the funds we receive, but it would be very nice for the funds we receive to go towards paying back what we've already spent on the project. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Besides assisting in the funding of this film, the number one thing you can do to help us out is to tell others about this film project. If you liked it yourself or you can think of somebody who also might like it, <strong>share</strong> the project with them.</p>
<p>Also remember, Indiegogo has share tools that can make it easier for you to share this film with others on Facebook or wherever, but if that's not your thing then good ol' fashioned word of mouth would be much appreciated.</p>
<p><strong>Again, thank you for checking out this campaign, see you on the big screen!</strong></p>

Our crew is built up of a tight-knit community of talented individuals and students. The film is directed by Carson Rhodes. Edited by the skilled Will Vail. Our director of photography Connor Munch. Music by the amazing Kanoa Wolfe-Doblin. Additional VFX by Mutiny FX. And some more incredibly talented individuals working with Sound mixing, Arri lights, Steadicam, plenty of c-stands and grip tape, practical VFX, Incredible locations, and the Red Komodo 6k Camera.

Risks & Challenges
This project is my senior film to complete my degree and finish college, but it's also a film I'm passionate about. Like most passion projects they lack funds. We've decided that now is the best time to do the project, and we have most of it together. All we need now is the funds to reimburse our progress. This film is going to be made regardless of the funds we receive, but it would be very nice for the funds we receive to go towards paying back what we've already spent on the project. 

Other Ways You Can Help
Besides assisting in the funding of this film, the number one thing you can do to help us out is to tell others about this film project. If you liked it yourself or you can think of somebody who also might like it, share the project with them.
Also remember, Indiegogo has share tools that can make it easier for you to share this film with others on Facebook or wherever, but if that's not your thing then good ol' fashioned word of mouth would be much appreciated.
Again, thank you for checking out this campaign, see you on the big screen!",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

In the film, the Tanaka family gathers to celebrate the 3rd birthday of their youngest child, Mae. Naomi, her mother, is drinking at the dinner table and Peter, Naomi's husband, is disappointed and tries to stray the family's attention away from her. Dinner is served by Naomi's parents and as the night goes on, tensions grow higher. Kyle, the couple's teenage son, grows tired of their sugarcoating and leaves the room, forcing Naomi to admit that she is unhappy. Her parents are lost as to why, but now all cards are on the table. Reluctantly, Peter must take responsibility for his part in the pain she has been feeling--he must confess what they have known for some time...he is a gay man. Despite the shock, Jichan and Bachan try to comfort Naomi and explain to her that in the end, family is all that matters.</p><h3>Why is this Important?</h3><p>This story highlights those who have struggled with their sexuality and were not able to find their voices earlier in life.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi there!  Thanks for stopping by our page!  We are Slade Wolfe Enterprises.  She is Lexi Wolfe - <strong>award-winning</strong> actress and writer - and he is Andrew Slade - with nearly 30 years experience in theatre, film and TV.  We're both PROUDLY NEURODIVERSE - aside other conditions, we both have ADHD, which is why this project is so important to us both.  Oh, and Our Brains really Can't Sit Still - which is why we're asking you to get involved!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1625825912/lokxhspnp24n3s2cs3at.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>While everyone has heard of ADHD,  it's still very misunderstood among most people - the stereotype of the hyperactive boy running and throwing things around still pervades, even though that's only one type of the condition.  The affect of ADHD in adults is not understood in the general consciousness at all.  In the UK alone it's estimated that over 4% of the adult population have ADHD - but as only 120,000 adults have been diagnosed (less that 10% of that 4%) the number could be much greater!</p>
<p>People with ADHD as adults are more likely to suffer from other mental health problems if their ADHD goes undiagnosed, as they struggle to deal with all the different things life can throw at you.</p>
<p>We're very proud to be working with Europe's largest user-led ADHD charity, The ADHD Foundation.</p>

<p>They are providing us with the latest statistics and research into the condition, and they will have use of the final film as an educational tool to help people understand more about what life with ADHD can be like for an adult.</p>
<p>While we have other funding already coming to the project, by supporting us you can help us get to work early on the pre-production elements of the shoot, which will help the shoot itself be more organised (critical for people with ADHD!), streamlined and overall better quality.</p>
<p>By supporting us you can help us get out a stronger message to educate and encourage people out there who think there is something wrong with them to see that they are capable, and talented, and that there are things out there they can do, and help to be found.  By supporting us, you will help giving hope to others.  What more precious gift is there, than to know you've been able to help another human being?</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We have set ourselves £3,000 as the target for this campaign.  That will be enough for us to focus full-time on script development, sourcing and paying for our locations, securing our cameraman and Director of Photography (we're hoping to work with the DOP we used for an international film project we shot during lockdown last year called The Night Time World (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3631242/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3631242/</a>)), and our sound engineer, to enable us to plan and plot the shoot so we can get the look and tone right when we go into filming.</p>
<p>Additional funds will be used to start on marketing and distribution efforts.  We're currently looking at a number of different film festivals, as well as agreements with alternative distributors who have interest in educational films like MBCSS.</p>

<h2>UPDATE: STRETCH GOALS</h2>
<p>So we made our goal! Thank you everyone!</p>
<p>In the remaining days, we'd like to hit $30,000 dollars and as many backers (even 1$ helps) as possible.</p>
<p>Here's what we will use that extra money on:</p>
<p>1. A visual effects shot of a full, moving self-driving car</p>
<p>2. An extra day of B-roll shooting to fill out the story-telling on two montage sequences.</p>
<p>3. Extra time in the studio recording live instruments for the soundtrack. </p>
<p>It is also really important for us and for the future of the movie that we get as many backers as possible. Come join our team. It costs almost nothing! Also there are some cool perks left</p>
<p>Thanks everyone!</p>

So we made our goal! Thank you everyone!
In the remaining days, we'd like to hit $30,000 dollars and as many backers (even 1$ helps) as possible.
Here's what we will use that extra money on:
1. A visual effects shot of a full, moving self-driving car
2. An extra day of B-roll shooting to fill out the story-telling on two montage sequences.
3. Extra time in the studio recording live instruments for the soundtrack. 
It is also really important for us and for the future of the movie that we get as many backers as possible. Come join our team. It costs almost nothing! Also there are some cool perks left
Thanks everyone!

WATCH THE TANGLE TEASER!
(PLEASE WATCH FULL SCREEN!)


 

 
  We need you!A small group of people has spent the last two years fighting to get this movie done on almost no money. We’ve worked this hard and so many people have donated so much time because we believe we have a special movie. It’s a movie we can’t wait to show you.But first we need your help. We are in the very last stretches. We have an almost fully edited movie, missing the finishing touches.What are we missing:One Shoot DaySpecial EffectsSound MixColor MixLawyer and Accountant FeesRecording the ScoreGoing to festivalsDistributing the movie to the worldWe want and need you on our team.The more you can chip in, the better all of these elements will be. Can’t chip in? Not to worry, you can still join the team. Help by spreading the word far and wide by sharing this Indiegogo campaign. Thank You!   Do you like sci-fi? We made The Tangle for you. It is an original science fiction world of the near future with an elaborate imagined structure that even the geekiest fan will love.Do you like stylish film noir? We made The Tangle for you. We made film with all the style, all the dark shadows and dark language of classic film noir.Do you like movies with beautiful dialogue? We made The Tangle for you. It is a deeply poetic movie with a unique rhythm and language all its own.Do you like independent film? The Tangle will satisfy. Made on a wing and a prayer by a team of generous and dedicated people, The Tangle is truly independent.   In the near future, the Tangle connects the world. Swarms of microdrones fill the air, the water, our very blood. In this world, it is impossible to keep a secret anywhere but in your S.O.L. (Secure OnTangle Line), a quantum encrypted hard drive implanted in your brain. It’s a world in which nothing is hidden and violence is supposed to be impossible.  A secret government agency called the A.S.P. (Army of Simply Purity) watches over the Tangle from within technology safe rooms, locations impermeable to the nanobots that make up the Tangle. A.S.P. agents FRANCESCA (Nicole da Silva), EDWARD (Christopher Soren Kelly), and LAUREL (Jessica Graham)  discover that field agent MARGOT FOSTER (Mary Jane Wells) was murdered in one of these rooms, an abandoned speakeasy.  It’s the first murder in California in three years.  The main suspect is CARTER CARMINE (Joshua Bitton), a private detective, who used to work with the agents of A.S.P. on a program called the Cleopatra Squad. Cleopatra created the Tangle. Carter had fallen in love with Cleopatra, so Margot got him removed from the squad. He was forbidden to contact Cleopatra ever again.Now, married A.S.P. agents Edward and Arrow have brought Carter to one of the safe rooms after they surgically removed his S.O.L. from his brain. They reveal that Carter was following Margot just before her murder, he has a motive, and he is one of the few in the world with the technical expertise to hide from the Tangle. The agents use the Tangle information to badger Carter: they know his movements down to the millimeter, down to the millisecond. He is clearly hiding something.  Eventually, everybody is a suspect and every secret gets exposed: a conspiracy between Margot and Edward to curtail Cleopatra’s power over the Tangle; Edward, the man of duty, caught in a lie, the hidden connection between Laurel and Carter, the real identity of Cleopatra and, finally, the real explanation for Margot’s murder. Eventually, the agents must rush into the world, scrounging through obsolete technology to solve the murder and stop the collapse of the Tangle, the world as they know it.   The Tangle is ALMOST done, and now we need your help. We’ve shot and edited everything but the last scene. The money contributed will help us to shoot that last scene and complete the edit.We will also need money to finish the special effects. You can’t have sci-fi without effects! It’s absolutely essential that we get a top notch sound designer for this film, this Indiegogo will help with that too. Then we need funds to take the film to festivals and ultimately deliver it to a distributor. And there are also all those expenses for lawyers and accountants and exciting stuff like that. To cover all this we are hoping to raise $25,000.    Though we encourage you to take advantage of the perks we're offering, if you want to give 100% of the amount to THE TANGLE simply click on the 'Back It' button at the top of the page and give whatever you can. But all the rest of you: be among the first to own The Tangle! You help us get it done and we will send it to you when it is complete. You can order the movie alone or with the soundtrack.

(during the ""Bound"" days!) and all with a pinch of Alex Proyas via ""Dark City"" and ""The Crow,"" Kelly could very well be the next Fincher...Kelly has a rich and keen camera eye that matches and in some cases surpasses some of the all time great visual filmmakers that we have come to know and love and it’s thrilling to watch.” Jason Coleman  - StarpulseChristopher Soren Kelly is veteran of the indie-film world, having starred in dozens of shorts and features.

Diente de león es un cortometraje narrativo que será filmado el próximo mes de noviembre en el estado de Hidalgo, en México. La historia habla sobre Ingrid, una adolescente que después de ser forzada por su familia a irse a vivir con un hombre mucho mayor a ella, queda embarazada y se ve obligada a tomar una difícil decisión contando sólo con el apoyo de su mejor amiga.

The most important aspect of the film, besides its intentions, is the choice of cinemas which appear in the film.</i></p><p>The filmmakers want to make it clear that, whilst the film should be perceived (<i>and perform</i>) as a sign of solidarity to <strong><u>all</u></strong> cinemas irrespective of their structure and beliefs - we want to highlight <u><strong>independent cinemas</strong></u> who have either been particularly:</p><ul>
<li>unsupported - financially or otherwise,</li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>'In the End' is a psychological character study/family drama and takes place in a post apocalyptic world. After the fall of humanity, a family lives in an isolated woodland cabin where they have been able to survive. Due to their mundane lifestyle, the cabin serves as a sort of metaphorical purgatory where the three simply exist. The father, Arthur, is man with a hardened soul and does what he can to make his wife and daughter's lives livable. His wife, Tess, has begun to ponder what it means to live and struggles to grasp what the family’s purpose in life is after the death of their son. Their daughter Angie has grown up in this new world and knows only the details her parents tell her about the world that was. In order to give his daughter a life worth living, Arthur only seeks to provide however he finds that more is asked of him than he can give when his wife makes one last terrible request. The themes of the film include parenthood, what it means to provide and sacrifice in addition to asking more philosophical questions such as what it truly means to be human. The story takes inspiration from several modern arthouse horror films in that we will be prioritizing minimalism over maximalist ideals whilst thematically exploring the complexities of our characters' psyches. Stylistically, we will focus on slow building tension placing an emphasis on cold and distanced shot framing to build a vulnerable stillness that immerses the viewer into the world of the story.</p>

<h3>Note from The Director - Kevin Rechlin</h3>
<p>Over the course of the last year, I have worked diligently to develop and fine tune my skills as a filmmaker. Specifically as a Director, I have enjoyed the creative process of working on several shorts in addition to some commercial work.

<h3>What We Need!</h3>
<p>We have an extremely talented team that has come together to bring this film to life. However, due to the ambitious nature of the way we want to tell the story, we face some financial difficulty with funding the film. In an attempt to be as straight forward with our donors as possible, we would like to break down precisely where our funds will go towards. Though the Metfilm school covers our film kit and insurances expenses, we still need help with the following...</p>
<p><u>Location Costs</u> :</p>
<p>In order to make our film feel as immersive as possible, finding a suitable yet practical location is critical. As our story is set in a woodland cabin in a post-apocalyptic world, there is a certain challenge that comes with tracking down the best location. Though we have an extremely desirable location in mind, there is still a cost to be had with filming for a three to four day period. In addition, shooting in the woods provides challenges of it's own so extra costs such as hiring generators for electricity are necessary to consider.</p>
<p><u>Travel Expenses</u> :</p>
<p>This may be an extension of location costs but due to the fact that most of our production team are based in London, we need to factor in costs of making sure our whole crew can make their way to set. This may include train ticket costs, petrol/gasoline expenses and potentially vehicle rentals to transport kit to the location.</p>
<p><u>Acting Talent</u> :</p>
<p>In addition to location costs, hiring proper acting talent is where we project a good chunk of our budget will go towards. Hiring actors by the day comes at a cost however talented actors have the ability to escalate the project to new heights. We want to have a cast that brings our characters to life in a way that does the most justice for the story.</p>
<p><u>Food and Drink </u>:</p>
<p>As we will have a crew of around ten people in addition to our cast of three, there will be a cost associated with providing food and drink for everyone on set.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
'In the End' is a psychological character study/family drama and takes place in a post apocalyptic world. After the fall of humanity, a family lives in an isolated woodland cabin where they have been able to survive. Due to their mundane lifestyle, the cabin serves as a sort of metaphorical purgatory where the three simply exist. The father, Arthur, is man with a hardened soul and does what he can to make his wife and daughter's lives livable. His wife, Tess, has begun to ponder what it means to live and struggles to grasp what the family’s purpose in life is after the death of their son. Their daughter Angie has grown up in this new world and knows only the details her parents tell her about the world that was. In order to give his daughter a life worth living, Arthur only seeks to provide however he finds that more is asked of him than he can give when his wife makes one last terrible request. The themes of the film include parenthood, what it means to provide and sacrifice in addition to asking more philosophical questions such as what it truly means to be human. The story takes inspiration from several modern arthouse horror films in that we will be prioritizing minimalism over maximalist ideals whilst thematically exploring the complexities of our characters' psyches. Stylistically, we will focus on slow building tension placing an emphasis on cold and distanced shot framing to build a vulnerable stillness that immerses the viewer into the world of the story.

Note from The Director - Kevin Rechlin
Over the course of the last year, I have worked diligently to develop and fine tune my skills as a filmmaker. Specifically as a Director, I have enjoyed the creative process of working on several shorts in addition to some commercial work. 'In the End' will serve as my Masters Graduation film and though the film will provide new challenges, both practically and creatively, I hope to bring together all my prior experience up until this point to create something special. My desire to direct this project came from my love of modern arthouse horror films and coming from a psychology background, I have always been drawn to psychologically complex characters and stories. I hope to put together a piece of work that challenges the viewer to make interpretations of their own whilst immersing them both visually and emotionally into the world of the characters.

<p> </p>
<h3>Why Are We Making This Film?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">With 3B7, we don't want to talk about cinema. Instead, we want to talk about why cinema means so much to our lives. Many of us can point to a movie and recall where we were, who we were with, and so much more from the cinema we saw it in. Some of us have found love at the cinema or gone there for therapy when we've lost it. It's been there for us when we've needed it. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1615138406/z9npp2nbbrwptaenxe9s.jpg"" src=""""/><br/>  <br/>3B7 also updates the memory of the cinema for the filmgoers of today. With our two female leads, Daisy and Regina, we're determined to put LGBTQ+ experiences at the heart of our project. Cinema can only mean as much as it does if everybody can find belonging in it. Our love story redefines the classic cinema experience through an LGBTQ+ lens, bringing a new perspective to what movies mean to us all. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1615138498/tqtx8uenzzzmczwotwhu.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why Should We Make This Film?<br/>  </h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">With 3B7, our whole team has a story to tell. It's a story that comes from our writer, Ryan Whittingham, who works at the very cinema we've set and will produce the film in. It comes from our producer, Eliza Beth Stevens, who's spent day after day at the Picturehouse in her hometown finding inspiration. It's even the story of our lead actors, Madeleine Lloyd-Jones and Ida Regan, who've both made a living tending to screens, and been inspired to make a living being on them. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1615138568/pjzikusbahtxqtcbjcgb.jpg"" src=""""/><br/>  <br/>We've all found something in the cinema. With 3B7, we want to capture the magic feeling of entering that place that all film lovers know. Our short film, with your funding, will lovingly recreate a range of eras in our cinema. We've taken inspiration from the silent era-classics, the Technicolor adventures, the New Wave wonders, and the films we've adored in recent years. No matter what, though, it'll always be about how those films, and where we've seen them, have made us feel. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1615138638/zyy3ec9az9ssz4fnkmgf.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why Should We Make This Film Now?</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><br/>  <br/>With 3B7, we want to celebrate how we experience film and what that means to us. To us, the cinema is the smell of the popcorn and the sound of the people. It's the place where we connect over comedy, remember over romances, hide over horrors. For a year now, though, we haven't had the chance.  </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1615138709/jdgtqbpuvjvzzrggyxvy.jpg"" src=""""/><br/>  <br/>COVID-19 has had a devastating effect on our industry. But, in reality, it's only shown the turning tide in the business today. Filmmakers can't get their films shown in the places they love, while some eschew cinema completely. And, with independent cinemas unable to showcase the films they love to the world around them, we see something we love beginning to slip away. 3B7 will be a short film that, with your funding, shows why those beautiful cinemas need, and deserve, saving. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1615138777/jz8rmouav1cgnhcpwoyu.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why Does This Short Film Need Your Funding?</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> <br/>  <br/>3B7 is a short film we're desperate to create - but it can only reach its potential with extra funding. With this crowdfunding campaign, we want to call out to film lovers everywhere who want nothing more than to be part of a crowded movie theatre once again. Our film is a story that reminds us all how magical an experience cinema can be, and perhaps how much more it means than even that.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1615138874/gea3y09n2amybj4dxkts.jpg"" src=""""/><br/>  <br/>Our short film, with your generous funding, will have high-quality cameras, stunning equipment, and a trained team of professionals paid for their talent. However, a lot of our production is already in place. For example, we've been lucky enough to secure a stunning film location to bring Daisy and Regina's love story to life in living colour - the Picturehouse cinema at FACT Liverpool. This architectural marvel is the only place that can truly capture all the magic that a cinema can bring.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1615138929/u3ovm0wxbq0byhwkh6uh.jpg"" src=""""/> <br/>  <br/>Your funding will go a long way in other areas, though. We'll be able to turn our short film into a professional production with catering, accommodation for our cast and crew, and so much more. And, in return, we're offering a wide range of perks that give you the chance to be a part of the 3B7 journey. Screen 3, Row B, Seat 7 is about inclusion first, and our perks are perfect for anybody who's ever felt like they belonged under the projector light. </p>

  With your generous support, Screen 3, Row B, Seat 7 will be a celebration of film and the people and places that keep it alive. 

 
Why Are We Making This Film?
 
With 3B7, we don't want to talk about cinema. Instead, we want to talk about why cinema means so much to our lives. Many of us can point to a movie and recall where we were, who we were with, and so much more from the cinema we saw it in. Some of us have found love at the cinema or gone there for therapy when we've lost it. It's been there for us when we've needed it. 
  3B7 also updates the memory of the cinema for the filmgoers of today. With our two female leads, Daisy and Regina, we're determined to put LGBTQ+ experiences at the heart of our project. Cinema can only mean as much as it does if everybody can find belonging in it. Our love story redefines the classic cinema experience through an LGBTQ+ lens, bringing a new perspective to what movies mean to us all. 

 
Why Should We Make This Film?  
With 3B7, our whole team has a story to tell. It's a story that comes from our writer, Ryan Whittingham, who works at the very cinema we've set and will produce the film in. It comes from our producer, Eliza Beth Stevens, who's spent day after day at the Picturehouse in her hometown finding inspiration. It's even the story of our lead actors, Madeleine Lloyd-Jones and Ida Regan, who've both made a living tending to screens, and been inspired to make a living being on them. 
  We've all found something in the cinema. With 3B7, we want to capture the magic feeling of entering that place that all film lovers know. Our short film, with your funding, will lovingly recreate a range of eras in our cinema. We've taken inspiration from the silent era-classics, the Technicolor adventures, the New Wave wonders, and the films we've adored in recent years. No matter what, though, it'll always be about how those films, and where we've seen them, have made us feel. 

 
Why Should We Make This Film Now?
  With 3B7, we want to celebrate how we experience film and what that means to us. To us, the cinema is the smell of the popcorn and the sound of the people. It's the place where we connect over comedy, remember over romances, hide over horrors. For a year now, though, we haven't had the chance.  
  COVID-19 has had a devastating effect on our industry. But, in reality, it's only shown the turning tide in the business today. Filmmakers can't get their films shown in the places they love, while some eschew cinema completely. And, with independent cinemas unable to showcase the films they love to the world around them, we see something we love beginning to slip away. 3B7 will be a short film that, with your funding, shows why those beautiful cinemas need, and deserve, saving. 

 
Why Does This Short Film Need Your Funding?
   3B7 is a short film we're desperate to create - but it can only reach its potential with extra funding. With this crowdfunding campaign, we want to call out to film lovers everywhere who want nothing more than to be part of a crowded movie theatre once again. Our film is a story that reminds us all how magical an experience cinema can be, and perhaps how much more it means than even that.
   Our short film, with your generous funding, will have high-quality cameras, stunning equipment, and a trained team of professionals paid for their talent. However, a lot of our production is already in place. For example, we've been lucky enough to secure a stunning film location to bring Daisy and Regina's love story to life in living colour - the Picturehouse cinema at FACT Liverpool. This architectural marvel is the only place that can truly capture all the magic that a cinema can bring.
   Your funding will go a long way in other areas, though. We'll be able to turn our short film into a professional production with catering, accommodation for our cast and crew, and so much more. And, in return, we're offering a wide range of perks that give you the chance to be a part of the 3B7 journey. Screen 3, Row B, Seat 7 is about inclusion first, and our perks are perfect for anybody who's ever felt like they belonged under the projector light. 

 
How To Help Our Short Film
  3B7 is a short film that, with your funding, can remind us all about the magic of cinema and everything that comes with it. It brings us closer to the people we meet, the popcorn we eat, and the films we’ve fallen in love with. Everybody working on 3B7 is a mosaic of all of those moments. For your support, this whole team will put all of that into every frame of our film.  
  You can help 3B7 in other ways than just donating as well. With just a simple share, you could help us get the word out to film fans with the means to help. We appreciate that times are tough, and it isn't easy to find money to part with at the moment. But, if you're willing to donate or share our campaign, you'll make a big difference to 3B7's future.  
  Whatever you decide to do, we'll see you at the movies.   Love, James Stephenson & The 3B7 Team",15.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>A small group of acclaimed scientists and doctors deliver solid scientific evidence that could lead to a profound revolution.</p>
<h2>Your Heart Is Not a Pump.</h2>
<p>Instead, they found that it stops the blood flow, creates vortices and sends more information to the brain than vice versa. Our emotions, broadcast via our hearts throughout our bodies and far beyond, influence our brains capacity to be creative and solve problems. Last but not least it synchronizes us to the ‘heartbeat’ of our beautiful planet earth. The planet that many cultures deem to be a living, intelligent being. And some cultures even say that the whole universe is inside our heart ...</p>
<p>Could it be that not with our brilliant brains, even enhanced with artificial intelligence, but rather with our hearts we will find solutions to the heart-breaking health, social and other problems we are facing worldwide?</p>
<p>In this film, we explore our human life from before the first heartbeat to beyond the last heartbeat. We weave together studies from cutting-edge science, the wisdom of a Sufi master, an ancient myth about our planet and intimate personal experiences from people of all walks of life, to show you why this mysterious pulsing organ is the key to all we ever longed for.</p>

<p>Created by a team of filmmakers who have worked on Oscar nominated and Sundance winning films, Dawn of Hearts is a poetic science documentary that will forever change the way you see your heart, yourself and life.</p>
<p>There are only two things that could prevent us from having paradise on this planet. Our belief that more mind and technology is what we need. And our conditioning to ignore most of what we feel, meaning what our heart tells us.</p>

<h2><strong>THE GROUND-BREAKING STORY</strong></h2>
<p>Pulsing impressions of life, maybe memories, maybe a life to come ... holding hands, a gentle kiss, giving birth, the first steps in life, tears of heartbreak, looking to the stars, war and destruction, growing old, entering a hospital … impressions dancing to the eternal rhythms of our hearts.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1513626758/yzfgrv3487c08fnptf8h.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We begin our journey where sadly to many of us end up. In a hospital waiting for her heart surgery an elderly woman tells us how she feels. Asking the surgeon about the role our heart has the answer is what we all expected: Our heart is a pump.</p>
<p>But as we visit Li, the young Ph.D. student and film his last experiment we become witness of an unbelievable scenery; blood moves without a heart pumping it. He is investigating the effect that infrared light has on the blood flow.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1513626780/u1lhj1yheozrb84uybfu.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Prof. Pollack, Li’s mentor and the world’s leading water expert, has published a ground-breaking book on water that helps explain this mind-boggling observation. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1513626832/kp1o0pkwhyybfylj86nw.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>He shares the tentative conclusions from their research with us ""It is astonishing to think that it's not just your heart that's driving everything but it could be also light energy.""</p>
<p>A century ago Rudolf Steiner, the founder of Waldorf education, biodynamic agriculture and anthroposophical medicine made a provocative statement. For humanity to evolve three 'things' need to happen. One of them is that we have to realize that our heart is not a pump.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1513626860/kypbmakykccp3kocapsy.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>His teachers sometimes called him Doubting Thomas because he had such a hard time accepting authority figures. Especially if the answer to “Why?” was “Because someone said so.” Nearly 40 years ago, in his early twenties, Thomas Cowan, a medical doctor from San Francisco stumbled upon Steiner’s work. He did not understand it at first, but today he can explain in easy to understand concepts how our heart works and what it’s real purpose is. </p>
<p>As we continue to paint an new portrait of this pulsing mystery in our chest, we visit the renowned Institute of Heartmath. Dr. McCraty has spearheaded cutting-edge studies that were published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1513626885/bllir6utxrjnep7agdrc.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>His mind-bending research shows that our hearts energetic field is many times stronger than that of our brains. A mother’s brainwave can synchronize to the baby’s heartbeat. Our heart has it’s own memory and sends more information to our brain than vice versa. Uplifting emotions help our brain to solve problems, be more creative and make good decisions. Via our heart we can access information beyond the confines of time and space and last but not least his studies show that we are truly connected. To each other and this planet, via our hearts.</p>
<p>But the scientific approach to investigating reality is just one path. Using your own consciousness to explore the nature of existence is another. “As the heart begins to awaken, we begin to experience that this whole life is animate. Nothing is random, nothing is purely accidental. Everything is part of our own, if I may say so, individually designed curriculum of the heart.”</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1513626911/hrx5tfzrxt0k2mt3ufpt.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Kabir Helminksi, a Suf master and Rumi translator who has vast personal experience of the mystical dimensions of the life explains how our heart is the instrument that connects us to an aspect of reality that our minds cannot access.</p>
<p>While these subject matter experts paint a picture of our hearts that will redefine how we see and treat our hearts we believe that we are all important puzzle pieces of this breath-taking and challenging mystery called existence. And so we’ll talk to people from all walks of life, a young couple in love, fresh parents, kids in school and a sweet older couple to discover the magic of our hearts.</p>

<h2>WHY WE NEED TO MAKE THIS MOVIE</h2>
<p>There is one thing that probably connects all of us, no matter how different we are. At least I choose to believe so. The wish to live in a world where we all live in a peaceful, healthy environment and have a fulfilled life.</p>
<p>But this is far from the world we have today. And still many people today believe that if we invent and use more technologies we’ll soon have the world we all long for.</p>
<p>With all scientific ‘blessing for humanity’ innovations, be it chemical pesticides, medical drugs, nuclear energy or computers, mobile phones and social media it takes years, more often decades until we discover the down-sides of these inventions.</p>
<p>All our inventions were created using our mind-consciousness. Is there another state of consciousness that we could access? Could it be that there is a heart-consciousness that is equally important as our mind to solve problems?<br/>We strongly believe that we humans are able to solve all of our current problems and create the world we long for. And with this film we suggest that this starts by realizing the true purpose and potential of our hearts.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1513627049/bc7qx4ygj6tmhdf6rqde.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h2>WE HAVE A DREAM &amp; MISSION</h2>
<p>We want to inspire teachers around the world to change our educational system, which is nearly exclusively focused on training our minds, to equally facilitate the full potential of their student's hearts. Towards that goal, we offer all high schools around the world in low GDP countries FREE streamings/downloads of this documentary for classroom screenings.</p>
<p>And there are a few more things we aim to achieve with this film:</p>
<p>1) Increase awareness that our heart is not a pump</p>
<p>2) Ignite a worldwide discussion about the true purpose and potential of our hearts</p>
<p>3) Encourage viewers to take measurable steps to improve their heart health and activate the full potential of their hearts</p>
<p>4) Collect, preserve and present indigenous knowledge and wisdom about our hearts from around the world</p>
<p><br/>If you like our vision and mission, please share it with those people who also long for a more heartful and brighter future.</p>

<h2>ABOUT THE DIRECTOR</h2>
<p>At age 13 I was determined to become a theoretical physicist. Back then it seemed to be the only way I could discover and understand the deepest mysteries of life. Then I realized that in order to understand life completely I would have to study it all. From math and music to physics to psychology and everything else. It was hopeless to ever discover the secrets of life. Feeling disconnected from life and depressed I fell into a deep darkness. It took me many years to find my path to not just cope with all the unpleasant emotions, but to end up living my life like I would have never dreamt before. No, life is not easy and without pain, but most of the time it is an incredible magic gift that I can experience, primarily through my heart.</p>
<p>This is my debut as a filmmaker. Throughout diverse careers, I gained creative skills (12+ years as a sound designer in the German movie industry), solid analytical (passed German naturopath exam) and business skills (3 years as a product manager with $1+ Mio./yr revenue responsibility). And I enjoy learning and improving my work with the feedback of others.</p>
<p>Over the last 23 years, I looked into various paradigms, always seeking a deeper understanding and experience of life. Since 14+ years my specific interest is emotion and the heart. In March 2017 I co-created the online event 'The Heart Revolution' presenting best-selling and award-winning speakers about the various aspects of our hearts.</p>

THE GROUND-BREAKING STORY
Pulsing impressions of life, maybe memories, maybe a life to come ... holding hands, a gentle kiss, giving birth, the first steps in life, tears of heartbreak, looking to the stars, war and destruction, growing old, entering a hospital … impressions dancing to the eternal rhythms of our hearts.

We begin our journey where sadly to many of us end up. In a hospital waiting for her heart surgery an elderly woman tells us how she feels. Asking the surgeon about the role our heart has the answer is what we all expected: Our heart is a pump.
But as we visit Li, the young Ph.D. student and film his last experiment we become witness of an unbelievable scenery; blood moves without a heart pumping it. He is investigating the effect that infrared light has on the blood flow.

Prof. Pollack, Li’s mentor and the world’s leading water expert, has published a ground-breaking book on water that helps explain this mind-boggling observation.

A century ago Rudolf Steiner, the founder of Waldorf education, biodynamic agriculture and anthroposophical medicine made a provocative statement. For humanity to evolve three 'things' need to happen. One of them is that we have to realize that our heart is not a pump.

His teachers sometimes called him Doubting Thomas because he had such a hard time accepting authority figures. Especially if the answer to “Why?” was “Because someone said so.” Nearly 40 years ago, in his early twenties, Thomas Cowan, a medical doctor from San Francisco stumbled upon Steiner’s work. He did not understand it at first, but today he can explain in easy to understand concepts how our heart works and what it’s real purpose is. 
As we continue to paint an new portrait of this pulsing mystery in our chest, we visit the renowned Institute of Heartmath. Dr. McCraty has spearheaded cutting-edge studies that were published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. 

His mind-bending research shows that our hearts energetic field is many times stronger than that of our brains. A mother’s brainwave can synchronize to the baby’s heartbeat. Our heart has it’s own memory and sends more information to our brain than vice versa. Uplifting emotions help our brain to solve problems, be more creative and make good decisions. Via our heart we can access information beyond the confines of time and space and last but not least his studies show that we are truly connected. To each other and this planet, via our hearts.
But the scientific approach to investigating reality is just one path. Using your own consciousness to explore the nature of existence is another. “As the heart begins to awaken, we begin to experience that this whole life is animate. Nothing is random, nothing is purely accidental. Everything is part of our own, if I may say so, individually designed curriculum of the heart.”

Kabir Helminksi, a Suf master and Rumi translator who has vast personal experience of the mystical dimensions of the life explains how our heart is the instrument that connects us to an aspect of reality that our minds cannot access.
While these subject matter experts paint a picture of our hearts that will redefine how we see and treat our hearts we believe that we are all important puzzle pieces of this breath-taking and challenging mystery called existence. And so we’ll talk to people from all walks of life, a young couple in love, fresh parents, kids in school and a sweet older couple to discover the magic of our hearts.


WHY WE NEED TO MAKE THIS MOVIE
There is one thing that probably connects all of us, no matter how different we are. At least I choose to believe so. The wish to live in a world where we all live in a peaceful, healthy environment and have a fulfilled life.
But this is far from the world we have today. And still many people today believe that if we invent and use more technologies we’ll soon have the world we all long for.
With all scientific ‘blessing for humanity’ innovations, be it chemical pesticides, medical drugs, nuclear energy or computers, mobile phones and social media it takes years, more often decades until we discover the down-sides of these inventions.
All our inventions were created using our mind-consciousness. Is there another state of consciousness that we could access? Could it be that there is a heart-consciousness that is equally important as our mind to solve problems?We strongly believe that we humans are able to solve all of our current problems and create the world we long for. And with this film we suggest that this starts by realizing the true purpose and potential of our hearts.

WE HAVE A DREAM & MISSION
We want to inspire teachers around the world to change our educational system, which is nearly exclusively focused on training our minds, to equally facilitate the full potential of their student's hearts. Towards that goal, we offer all high schools around the world in low GDP countries FREE streamings/downloads of this documentary for classroom screenings.
And there are a few more things we aim to achieve with this film:
1) Increase awareness that our heart is not a pump
2) Ignite a worldwide discussion about the true purpose and potential of our hearts
3) Encourage viewers to take measurable steps to improve their heart health and activate the full potential of their hearts
4) Collect, preserve and present indigenous knowledge and wisdom about our hearts from around the world
If you like our vision and mission, please share it with those people who also long for a more heartful and brighter future.

ABOUT THE DIRECTOR
At age 13 I was determined to become a theoretical physicist. Back then it seemed to be the only way I could discover and understand the deepest mysteries of life. Then I realized that in order to understand life completely I would have to study it all. From math and music to physics to psychology and everything else. It was hopeless to ever discover the secrets of life. Feeling disconnected from life and depressed I fell into a deep darkness. It took me many years to find my path to not just cope with all the unpleasant emotions, but to end up living my life like I would have never dreamt before. No, life is not easy and without pain, but most of the time it is an incredible magic gift that I can experience, primarily through my heart.
This is my debut as a filmmaker. Throughout diverse careers, I gained creative skills (12+ years as a sound designer in the German movie industry), solid analytical (passed German naturopath exam) and business skills (3 years as a product manager with $1+ Mio./yr revenue responsibility). And I enjoy learning and improving my work with the feedback of others.
Over the last 23 years, I looked into various paradigms, always seeking a deeper understanding and experience of life. Since 14+ years my specific interest is emotion and the heart. In March 2017 I co-created the online event 'The Heart Revolution' presenting best-selling and award-winning speakers about the various aspects of our hearts.
Let’s have a Skype call if you have questions or want to get to know me before you support the production of this movie! Or if you want to get involved beyond this crowdfunding campaign.

Risks and challenges
Filmmaking is an art and not an exact science. Although we are well prepared and have the necessary skills to deliver a high quality film it may take us longer than anticipated. The biggest risk is always to not have enough funds to finish the film. But here is the good news: This film is a heart-project for the filmmaker and it is not a question of will it get made, but only when will it be released. This is what I’m living for and it is just the beginning of more films that will explore the depths and mysteries of our hearts and life. Plus we have great support from experts at The Film Collaborative and the Sundance Creative Distribution Initiative.",16.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Krystyna Hutchinson, Ally Giannini, and Ben Nigh combined their passion for psychological thrillers with the deeply personal themes of trauma, PTSD, and repressed memories into a new film, called <strong>""The Tower.""</strong></p>
<p>This short film will invite our audience to face their own memories through the main character, Lucy, who will be performed by Krystyna. Lucy receives an ominous tarot card reading that sends her running. She realizes she's being followed, but no matter where she runs the elusive figure is already there waiting. What happens when she can't run anymore? Stay tuned to find out...<br/><br/>We are asking for your help to raise <strong>$40,000</strong> so we can bring ""The Tower"" to life.</p>
<p>These funds will be used in these main areas:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Locations</strong></li>
<li><strong>Anamorphic lenses and Alexa Mini Camera kit</strong></li>
<li>
<strong>Cast &amp; Crew</strong> </li>
<li><strong>Moonlight Screening, digital release, &amp; festival fees</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><br/>The locations are integral visual metaphors and characters. Our goal is to shoot around New York City on Roosevelt Island, in Tudor City, and Hunter's Point Park. Part of those funds will go to getting access and permits to shoot at these striking spots. It will also help cover costs associated with shooting on location including transportation, shelter, and craft services.<br/><br/>The funds will also help us secure an anamorphic lens kit, which will enhance the expansiveness of these landscapes and capture Lucy's isolation and growing dread as the film progresses. The lens kit will allow us to widen the field of view and explore monument horror.<br/><br/>After location and equipment, the rest of the funds will be to pay our wonderful crew, without whom we could not make this dream a reality. Aya Tariq will join us as our makeup artist. The film will be edited by Heather Mooney and feature an original score by Dan Krysa. The best version of this film has fully staffed departments in grip and electric, production design, camera, and post-production.

The whole city is being rebuilt through each person that walks through it and this film celebrates that. This film is for survivors of trauma – in its many forms. It's also for fans of new-age spiritualism, astrology, tarot, and horror as well as listeners of Krystyna Hutchinson's very popular podcasts, ""The Voices in Our Heads"" and ""Guys We Fucked."" We want our film to encourage folks to safely seek out the source of their pain and investigate the sadness they carry around.

 release Limited Edition DVD's with a booklet , with unseen archive 
images  of my towns mysterious retired  performing eccentric.            (Eccentricity)                                                             It would be amazing if you can help spread the word. Your contributions will help me finance the booklet/DVD's and a BBFC certificate.Mr. Somebody? ""Oscillating wildly from mad to insightful, Mangle-Wurzel carves a inspirational yet lonely figure of boundless imagination"".  Sunshine Wong - Sheffield Doc Fest 2014Here is something I prepared earlier with Jake to try explain the Limited Edition DVD release! Please see below: Hi I am Michelle Heighway. Between 2008-2013, I got my self a camera and editing suite  - I then created my 1st feature documentary about my home towns very own enigmatic eccentric Jake Mangle- Wurzel -  Mr. Somebody?It has been the most passionate self searching journey of my life; as a filmmaker so far!



""Mr. Somebody? is a very humorous yet occasionally deeply moving home-grown tale"". Bring the Noise



I also gained a little help from NFTS Film Clinic in 2013!
Since completion in 2014; I have screened at the world leading Sheffield Doc Fest and The well known Leeds International Film Festival.
I have had a overwhelming response from the people of Huddersfield , as they too are as  intrigued as I was about Jake Mangle-Wurzel. 
As a independent filmmaker I  am now in the process of creating a wonderful Limited Edition DVD release with a Booklet of images. (Seen and some wonderful archive unseen images!)
It is very important to me to release this DVD and Booklet to share this incredible story ; which also represents this creative time together. 
Mr. Somebody? is a wonderful  human, emotional portrait of Jake Mangle-Wurzel , it represents how Jake saved him self from the depths of despair by changing his name , his life and whole identity. I hope that each owner of the DVD can be  touched and inspired by Jake's courage and creativity .
This documentary not only captures the fascinating life style of a locally well known eccentric and prankster.  It is a story of the psychological resilience  of human beings and really captures how creativity can heal us on so many levels. I connected with Jake and his experiences and I hope that this documentary can also connect and inspire you, all of you out in big wide world too! For me that's what documentaries are about  - connecting , sharing, learning and inspiring. I hope my incredible journey as a 1st time feature indie documentary maker will touch you and take you on a journey they way it has for me.

<p><strong>IN SEARCH OF WEEPING JIM</strong></p>
<p>Hibernian Media NFP has been awarded a generous grant from The Consulate General of Ireland to further develop this film, IN SEARCH OF WEEPING JIM and we encourage you to join us in this journey of discovery of the life and times of James Ambrose Kearns and his family. It’s another great story of an Irishman who transformed America.</p>
<p>Hibernian Transmedia NFP is a public charity dedicated to Irish and Irish American culture. We tell stories to enlighten future generations while honoring our ancestors. </p>
<p><strong>All donations are tax-deductible.</strong></p>
<p>James Ambrose Kearns was born to James and Catherine Quinn Kearns on January 13, 1871, on the tiny inner island of Inishcuttle, Kilmeena, County Mayo, Ireland. He emigrated to America in 1884 at the age of 13, attended St. Ignatius College Prep and Kent School of Law, becoming a lawyer in Chicago where he served as Alderman, Clerk of the Municipal Court and County Treasurer. He is considered “the father of the Chicago flag”.</p>
<p>He earned the moniker “Weeping Jim” from colleagues who had watched him at wakes as he campaigned, always offering his condolences and compassion for the bereaved families. It worked.</p>

<p>“Whereas it is fitting and proper that the city of Chicago should have an emblem of its history, progress, enterprise and achievement made manifest in the shape and character of a municipal flag in order to symbolize properly the civic spirit of the city of Chicago, visualize local patriotism, stimulate industrial progress, and instill in the hearts of school children and of citizens a concrete evidence and example of the reality of the City of Chicago as a corporate  community and civic organism.”</p>

Hibernian Media NFP has been awarded a generous grant from The Consulate General of Ireland to further develop this film, IN SEARCH OF WEEPING JIM and we encourage you to join us in this journey of discovery of the life and times of James Ambrose Kearns and his family. It’s another great story of an Irishman who transformed America.

All donations are tax-deductible.
James Ambrose Kearns was born to James and Catherine Quinn Kearns on January 13, 1871, on the tiny inner island of Inishcuttle, Kilmeena, County Mayo, Ireland. He emigrated to America in 1884 at the age of 13, attended St. Ignatius College Prep and Kent School of Law, becoming a lawyer in Chicago where he served as Alderman, Clerk of the Municipal Court and County Treasurer. He is considered “the father of the Chicago flag”.
He earned the moniker “Weeping Jim” from colleagues who had watched him at wakes as he campaigned, always offering his condolences and compassion for the bereaved families. It worked.
The story of Weeping Jim is the story of the Irish immigrant in America. They came, usually with nothing but the clothes on their backs, and with hard work, wit, and great faith, made their way until they were eventually ruling America.
This film tells the story of one man from County Mayo but could be the quintessential story for the Irish Diaspora.

They have been researching the border issues behind <i>SIN NADA</i> for over six years, and felt that the issue was too important to remain within academic circles. Maite went on to make a short-length documentary specifically about the search and rescue group Aguilas del Desierto, titled <i>Águilas </i>(dir.

Desde hace más de 6 años han realizado estudios sobre la grave crisis humanitaria que tiene lugar en la frontera y que se aborda en SIN NADA. Debido a la urgencia del tema, Zubiaurre y Crisman sintieron la necesidad de llevarlo más allá del círculo académico. Maite se dio a la tarea de hacer un corto documental específicamente sobre el grupo de búsqueda y rescate “Águilas del Desierto”,  titulado <i>Águilas</i> (Kristy Guevara-Flanagan y Maite Zubiaurre, 2021), el cual ha recibido importantes reconocimientos, entre ellos, los galardones al mejor corto documental que otorgan Big Sky, SXSW y LALIFF.</p><p>Sin embargo, para capturar la complejidad del problema y retratar la ecología de atención al migrante era necesario producir un largometraje documental donde se hiciera un abordaje más profundo sobre la vida en frontera.

Estas familias han colaborado de cerca con los personajes que aparecen en el documental, y nuestro objetivo es representar en profundidad su carácter humano y participación en la ecología de atención al migrante. Estamos seguros de que no podríamos lograrlo sin retratar esos  lugares y escuchar esas voces, ¡por eso necesitamos tu ayuda!

Kristy Guevara-Flanagan and Maite Zubiaurre, 2021).Migration has consequences on both sides of the US-Mexico border: when somebody migrates, families and loved ones are left behind, and lives change forever. SIN NADA / WITH NOTHING tells the story of four migrants who take action into their own hands to help the families of other migrants lost in the Arizona desert.Oaxacan activist Marisela Ortiz, co-founder with Ely Ortiz of the search and rescue group Aguilas del Desierto/Desert Eagles; Guatemalan activist Mirza Monterroso, Missing Migrant Program Director of the Colibri Center for Human Rights; and of Colombian artist Alvaro Enciso who has put out close to 1,000 crosses in the Arizonan desert to honor those who died are fundamental contributors to the “ecology of migrant care.” Their relentless altruism and powerful agency — despite having no resources or support — shed glaring light on the humanitarian crisis of migrant death escalating at the border.Presentando SIN NADA / WITH NOTHING
La migración tiene consecuencias en ambos lados de la frontera entre México y Estados Unidos: cuando alguien emigra, las vidas de la familia y los seres queridos que se quedan cambian para siempre. SIN NADA / WITH NOTHING narra la historia de cuatro migrantes que toman la iniciativa de ayudar a familias de migrantes que desaparecieron en el desierto de Arizona al intentar cruzar hacia EEUU. Marisela Ortiz, activista oaxaqueña, cofundadora del grupo de búsqueda y rescate “Águilas del Desierto/Desert Eagles”; Mirza Monterroso, activista guatemalteca, Directora del Programa Migrante Desaparecido del Centro Colibrí para los Derechos Humanos; y Álvaro Enciso, artista colombiano que ha puesto cerca de 1,000 cruces en el desierto de Arizona para honrar a quienes han fallecido,  son los colaboradores fundamentales de “la ecología de atención al migrante”. Su altruismo inexorable y poderosa capacidad de intervención -sin contar con recursos ni apoyo - vierten  un rayo de luz sobre la muerte migrante y la creciente crisis humanitaria de la frontera. Exclusive first look at teaser #1 for SIN NADA / WITH NOTHING
Note: you can click on the blue title in the video image before clicking play to open the video in a new window, which will allow you to watch in full screen mode. This documentary film project is produced and written by Maite Zubiaurre and Jonathan Crisman, two professors from UCLA and the University of Arizona. They have been researching the border issues behind SIN NADA for over six years, and felt that the issue was too important to remain within academic circles. Maite went on to make a short-length documentary specifically about the search and rescue group Aguilas del Desierto, titled Águilas (dir. Kristy Guevara-Flanagan & Maite Zubiaurre, 2021), which has gone on to receive numerous awards, including best short documentary at Big Sky, SXSW, and LALIFF, among others.Nevertheless, a full-length documentary which captures the complexity of this issue and the ecology of migrant care is needed, along with more expertise about capturing lived border experiences on film. Dignicraft, a Tijuana-based film collective which includes Jose Luis Figueroa, Omar Foglio, and Paola Rodríguez, has been working on border, Latinx, and migration-related film projects for over 20 years, winning numerous awards (including an Emmy!) for their vision. They joined Maite and Jonathan as directors, co-writers, and co-producers in 2019, and we have been working together on SIN NADA since then.Quienes somosEsta película documental está escrita y producida por Maite Zubiaurre y Jonathan Crisman, profesores respectivamente de UCLA y de la Universidad de Arizona. Desde hace más de 6 años han realizado estudios sobre la grave crisis humanitaria que tiene lugar en la frontera y que se aborda en SIN NADA. Debido a la urgencia del tema, Zubiaurre y Crisman sintieron la necesidad de llevarlo más allá del círculo académico. Maite se dio a la tarea de hacer un corto documental específicamente sobre el grupo de búsqueda y rescate “Águilas del Desierto”,  titulado Águilas (Kristy Guevara-Flanagan y Maite Zubiaurre, 2021), el cual ha recibido importantes reconocimientos, entre ellos, los galardones al mejor corto documental que otorgan Big Sky, SXSW y LALIFF.Sin embargo, para capturar la complejidad del problema y retratar la ecología de atención al migrante era necesario producir un largometraje documental donde se hiciera un abordaje más profundo sobre la vida en frontera. Para ello, Maite y Jonathan unieron fuerzas con Dignicraft, colectivo cinematográfico de Tijuana, cuyos miembros incluyen a José Luis Figueroa, Omar Foglio y Paola Rodríguez. Dignicraft ha producido películas documentales sobre migración y frontera desde hace más de 20 años y recibido numerosos premios por su trabajo (entre ellos ¡un Emmy!). En el 2019, José Luis, Omar y Paola se unieron a Maite y Jonathan como directores, co-guionistas y co-productores de SIN NADA.We have already completed pre-production on our project, and also completed filming the first half of SIN NADA in Southern Arizona during 2020. We have already raised and spent $130,900 in these efforts, and now we are crowdfunding to raise the necessary money to complete production on the second half of SIN NADA which will be filmed in Mexico. The budget to finish the production phase of the project is $109,070, of which $56,700 is needed for filming in Mexico. We have already raised $20,600 in grants, so we are asking your help to raise the remaining $36,100 that we need to film in Mexico.This is an especially important piece of the project because we hear directly from the families and see the home communities of those who have gone missing. These families have worked with activists Marisela Ortiz and Mirza Monterroso, and our goal is to fully represent the humanity and agency within this ecology of migrant care. We can’t do it without seeing these places and hearing these voices throughout key sites in Mexico, and we need your help to do it! Every dollar that we raise will go directly to the costs of travel, equipment rentals, and crew for filming in Mexico — we are committed to seeing this project through no matter what. Any additional funds we raise will go toward remaining production costs, post-production costs, and distribution costs.Qué necesitamosHasta el momento está concluido el desarrollo del proyecto documental y también lo está la etapa de preproducción. Además, en el 2020 finalizamos la producción y rodaje de la primera parte de la película SIN NADA,  la cual tiene lugar en el sureste de Arizona. Hemos logrado recaudar y dedicado a los gastos de producción un total de $130,900 dólares, y ahora estamos iniciando una campaña de recaudación de fondos que nos permita acumular el dinero necesario para realizar la producción de la segunda parte de SIN NADA, que se filmará en México. El presupuesto total para el resto de la etapa de producción, es de $109,070 dólares, de los cuales $56,700 se utilizarán para cubrir el rodaje en México. Ya hemos recaudado $20,600 dólares a través de fondos y becas,pero  ahora acudimos a ti para recaudar el remanente de $36,100 dólares necesarios para costear lo más prioritario de la producción.  Esta etapa es una parte especialmente importante del proyecto porque nos da la oportunidad de escuchar la voz de las familias y conocer de primera mano las comunidades de origen de quienes han partido sin retorno. Estas familias han colaborado de cerca con los personajes que aparecen en el documental, y nuestro objetivo es representar en profundidad su carácter humano y participación en la ecología de atención al migrante. Estamos seguros de que no podríamos lograrlo sin retratar esos  lugares y escuchar esas voces, ¡por eso necesitamos tu ayuda! Cada dólar recaudado irá directamente a los gastos de viaje, renta de equipo y apoyos para colaboradores durante la filmación en México; estamos comprometidos a llevar este proyecto a su fin pase lo que pase.Take a look at the range of perks you can receive with a donation — we are excited to partner with you, and want to give you credit for helping us finish the film! Even with smaller donation amounts, we will give you credit online and in the film credits, and will invite you to a special screening of the documentary once it is released. Since many of the participants in the project, including people featured within the narrative, are artists, we are providing limited edition art prints and sculptures with a larger donation. And at the highest amount, we will provide special in-person experiences in Los Angeles and Mexico City. We also have an option for you to join on board as an associate producer!

<p>Based on true events, our story follows a Marine, Daniel Gonzales, who enlisted after September 9/11. He had a 40-year plan to serve his country but unfortunately, a tragic event while  performing his duty in Afghanistan left him bound to a wheelchair. He was lucky to survive but some of his teammates did not. With a punctured lung pierced by bullets, Daniel's body could not supply enough oxygen to his brain. Laying there unconscious while the doctors did their best to bring him back to life, Daniel's fate was in the hands of God. Luckily, he pulled through. After being diagnosed with cerebral palsy, severe nerve damage to his lower back and his lower extremities, Daniel just like many other soldiers, suffered from PTSD.</p>
<p>Although after surviving that fateful day, the war only begins after Daniel arrives back home. This film will show what happens to a soldier after being discharged from the military. </p>
<p>Despite all the struggles with depression and so many other obstacles, Daniel gets up every morning and fights. A fight within himself to make his life as normal as it can be.</p>

<p><u><strong>Introducing Charles Rooney, who is also a Marine.</strong></u></p>
<p>Charles is a Vietnam War Veteran <strong>who will play Daniel's mentor in this film</strong>.  Charles' war experience is crucial to Daniel's survival. Due to the fact of PTSD, many people do not understand how a soldier feels except another soldier. </p>
<p>Not a day goes by that Charles does not feel guilty about being alive, (Survival's Guilt). He along so many soldiers want to die on that battlefield so they won't be forgotten.</p>
<p>Being in the military gives guys like Charles and Daniel a sense or purpose, a sense of belonging, a brotherhood that bonds for a lifetime.</p>
<p>It is the brotherhood and the mentality of never leaving any man behind that this film will show our audience what it means to be a soldier.</p>

This film is about how each and everyone of us can contributeto our veterans in any way, shape or form.

Sam Medina will portray Daniel Gonzales.
 
Introducing Charles Rooney, who is also a Marine.
Charles is a Vietnam War Veteran who will play Daniel's mentor in this film.  Charles' war experience is crucial to Daniel's survival. Due to the fact of PTSD, many people do not understand how a soldier feels except another soldier. 
Not a day goes by that Charles does not feel guilty about being alive, (Survival's Guilt). He along so many soldiers want to die on that battlefield so they won't be forgotten.
Being in the military gives guys like Charles and Daniel a sense or purpose, a sense of belonging, a brotherhood that bonds for a lifetime.
It is the brotherhood and the mentality of never leaving any man behind that this film will show our audience what it means to be a soldier.

Why this project is important for us?

This campaign will help us to make an amazing and heartfelt project about Veterans who need our help lessening their burdens returning to our society. Although some soldiers do get help, the long lasting effect of war weighs heavily with them for the rest of their lives. For most Veterans, they do not survive the guilt.On an average, 22 Veterans commit suicide every day.

This film is a personal project for Sam Medina to give back and uplift our Veterans and it is with utmost importance that we come together to show them we care and appreciate what they have done for our country.

 
""As I'm writing this, I can hardly contain my tears, I'm sure many of you will feel the same way."" Sam Medina
To all our contributors:
The magnitude of what we can accomplish together is crucial to make this project come to life.
As much or as little that each and everyone of you who donate to this campaign, you will help us honoring our Veterans. To let them know that we have not forgotten about soldierslike Daniel and Charles. 
                     

What do we need and what do you get?

The funding will cover the pre-production, production and post-production of the movie.
Some proceeds will go to different charities for Veterans.
We do offer unique perks that will give you the opportunity to be part of a movie but also to contribute to a cause and help those who have served the United States of America.
The film is going to be made, even if the goal is not reached.
 To enhance the content of the film, we will pitch studios with the rough cut to be able to do flashback scenes in Afghanistan.


 
The Impact
Here is what difference and impact your contribution will make: 

Many soldiers have died so we can live in peace. It is our duty to never forget the blanket of freedom that our men and women in the military provide for us with blood and sacrifice.

22 - The Unforgotten Soldier project is ultimately a goal to save as many lives as we can.
By making this project goes worldwide, we have done our job as a human being helping out one another, men or women.
With our contributors' help, we can achieve this. We can help their voices to live on for those who have died defending our great country.

 

 

 
Strengths & Opportunities
We would like to share our strengths and opportunities to give you a clear and transparent insight on how we will deliver a project of quality.

This film has its foundations six years ago at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, where we first saw a production of Love’s Labour’s Lost and were inspired by how much we connected to these characters that were written over 400 years ago.  Jennifer directed the play when she was in high school and set it in a modern-day boarding school.  That production was sold out every night and received glowing reviews at a large fine arts festival.  Last summer we decided to take that project to the next level by transforming it into a film!  We successfully passed our goal and raised over $29,000 on our last Indiegogo campaign, which enabled us to get through production.
Love's Labour's Lost was shot in Austin, Texas, from June 13th to July 1st. Our dedicated and extremely talented cast and crew made the most of the long, jam-packed days, and we were able to stay on schedule and on budget for the entirety of the shoot.
A successful Shakespeare movie has characters that are accessible to anyone, regardless of the audience's familiarity with Shakespearean stories or language.  Almost everyone has experienced the pangs of first love and the joy of enduring friendship.  Our movie celebrates every type of love, from romantic to unrequited to fraternal.  The themes are universal, but the story is unique.

Already, just from watching the raw footage, we can see this project really coming together. With heartfelt performances, beautiful costumes, stunning production design, and exceptional camera work, this is a film that deserves to be seen.
And with your help, we can not only complete the film, but do it in a way that honors a story as complex and unique as Shakespeare's original work. 
   What We Need & What You Get We've already raised half of the money we need for post-production through independent fundraising, and now we just need $9,000 more to finish.  Here's a handy pie chart to show you how that money will be spent:

   Risks & Challenges Creating an independent film is an inherently risky venture, but we've already done the hard part!  The entire movie is done filming, so now we just need to raise enough to finish post-production.  Thanks to your support, our last Indiegogo campaign surpassed our goal, raising over $29,000.  Working with a microbudget, we put the money we initially raised to good use on high-quality cameras, lighting, and sound equipment, which gave the film a much higher production value than the true cost of making it.  We want to finish strong with a fantastic post-production crew who can polish this movie and get it ready for film festival submissions, so that someday soon you can see Love's Labour's Lost on the silver screen!
   Other Ways You Can Help Even if you can't contribute financially, that doesn't mean you can't help.  Spread the news about this campaign far and wide!  Share on Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, and any other social media sites you use!  Tell your family and friends, tell your neighbors and coworkers, tell your dog-walker, tell your English teacher, tell your checkout clerk at Whole Foods!  The more people know about Love's Labour's Lost, the better chance we have of seeing this movie premiere at a top-tier film festival.

</h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Logline</strong>: After getting dumped, Max takes advantage of new time travel technology to try to right her wrongs in the relationship and get her ex back.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Synopsis</h2>
<p>What would you do if you could travel back in time? Visit the dinosaurs? Run around the Acropolis? Have drinks with Picasso? </p>
<p>When Max is given this magical opportunity, she decides to travel back to...six months ago, before things started to go terribly wrong in her relationship with Rob. Max will do whatever it takes to try to get her taco-loving boyfriend back, even if it means breaking the rules of time travel which, as she’s repeatedly warned, could have dire consequences for all of humanity.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1628635767/dqbicpmtxppvzstukqbs.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""> </h2>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>WHY THIS STORY?</strong></h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p>Breakup Time Machine is a story about love, obsession, and the consequences of travelling back in time. </p>
<p>This movie asks the questions: What if women really were as obsessed with being in a relationship as society pressures them to be? Where is the line between obsession and love? If the future version of yourself sleeps with the past version of your ex, is it cheating? Breakup sex? An important scientific experiment? We don’t know! </p>
<p>This film hovers between realizing the worst versions of ourselves after a breakup and an exciting romp through time and space. The story challenges ideas about fixing relationships and self-growth by letting the main character do what we’ve all thought about but never done because of things like self-control and lack of time travel technology.</p>
<p>This movie is an absurdist comedy with quick jokes and slapstick humor. </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">BUT WHY US</h2>
<p>Our group of filmmakers in Toronto and around the globe are in love with this story about love. Some might even go so far to say...we’re obsessed with it. The director, producers, cast, and crew connected to Kayla’s story because it was like no other film they’d seen before: A time travel, sci fi, comedy, anti rom-com. Mostly, we wanted to see how many genres we could fit into one short film. </p>
<p>This short film has the slapstick humor of Juno mixed with cool Time Travel Visual Effects like Edge of Tomorrow &amp; Tenet. This drew director Bobby Markov to the project. He knows his way around cool visual effects through directing the award winning sci-fi film Metamorphosis and is excited to incorporate visual comedy in this film. </p>
<p>Lead producer Jeff Velez is obsessed with the sci fi genre and also does stand up comedy so thought this was the perfect marriage of his two interests. We’ve assembled a talented cast and crew in Toronto excited about this refreshing take on the sci fi and rom com genres. We wanted to ask them why they were excited to make this film but didn’t have time, so instead we guessed what they’d have to say about it: </p>
<p>“This is the greatest script I’ve ever read in my life. It just lights me up!” – Special effects flash bulb </p>
<p>“I laughed so hard milk came out my nose!” – Representative from the Dairy Lobby</p>
<p>“I think it could be shorter.” – Low ink cartridge </p>

</div></div>","WHAT IS 'Breakup Time Machine' 

 
Logline: After getting dumped, Max takes advantage of new time travel technology to try to right her wrongs in the relationship and get her ex back.
 
Synopsis
What would you do if you could travel back in time? Visit the dinosaurs? Run around the Acropolis? Have drinks with Picasso? 
When Max is given this magical opportunity, she decides to travel back to...six months ago, before things started to go terribly wrong in her relationship with Rob. Max will do whatever it takes to try to get her taco-loving boyfriend back, even if it means breaking the rules of time travel which, as she’s repeatedly warned, could have dire consequences for all of humanity.
 

 
WHY THIS STORY?
 
Breakup Time Machine is a story about love, obsession, and the consequences of travelling back in time. 
This movie asks the questions: What if women really were as obsessed with being in a relationship as society pressures them to be? Where is the line between obsession and love? If the future version of yourself sleeps with the past version of your ex, is it cheating? Breakup sex? An important scientific experiment? We don’t know! 
This film hovers between realizing the worst versions of ourselves after a breakup and an exciting romp through time and space. The story challenges ideas about fixing relationships and self-growth by letting the main character do what we’ve all thought about but never done because of things like self-control and lack of time travel technology.
This movie is an absurdist comedy with quick jokes and slapstick humor. 
 

 
BUT WHY US
Our group of filmmakers in Toronto and around the globe are in love with this story about love. Some might even go so far to say...we’re obsessed with it. The director, producers, cast, and crew connected to Kayla’s story because it was like no other film they’d seen before: A time travel, sci fi, comedy, anti rom-com. Mostly, we wanted to see how many genres we could fit into one short film. 
This short film has the slapstick humor of Juno mixed with cool Time Travel Visual Effects like Edge of Tomorrow & Tenet. This drew director Bobby Markov to the project. He knows his way around cool visual effects through directing the award winning sci-fi film Metamorphosis and is excited to incorporate visual comedy in this film. 
Lead producer Jeff Velez is obsessed with the sci fi genre and also does stand up comedy so thought this was the perfect marriage of his two interests. We’ve assembled a talented cast and crew in Toronto excited about this refreshing take on the sci fi and rom com genres. We wanted to ask them why they were excited to make this film but didn’t have time, so instead we guessed what they’d have to say about it: 
“This is the greatest script I’ve ever read in my life. It just lights me up!” – Special effects flash bulb 
“I laughed so hard milk came out my nose!” – Representative from the Dairy Lobby
“I think it could be shorter.” – Low ink cartridge

<h3><strong>Welcome to <i>ELLIPSES and SEMI-COLONS!</i></strong></h3>
<p>As a kid from Utah my dream of making movies seemed a distant fantasy. Through adversity and a winding road I am finally in position to realize the dream I never gave up on! For the last four years, I've been perfecting my craft as a graduate student at the prestigious UCLA Film School which helped me move to Los Angeles and meet some amazing people.  </p>
<p>I'm a definitely a nerd-cinephile who lives and breathes movies.  The hang-out genre is one of my absolute favorites and I have been planning this film in my head since I first saw <i>Dazed and Confused </i>when I was 14. In my undergrad college years in Utah Valley, I had a dangerously great time with my friends, creating tons of ridiculous stories to tell as a result. I poured all of the stories, the successes and self-sabotage, into this script. I couldn't be more excited to make this comedy with you!</p>
<h2>WHERE DOES THE MONEY GO?</h2>
<p><strong>How YOUR contribution helps!</strong></p>
<p><strong>TRANSPORTATION - Getting everyone there!</strong></p>
<p>Your contribution will help us reimburse the crew for gas and miles on their vehicles as well as fly in our leading actors.</p>
<p><strong>FOOD &amp; LODGING</strong> - <b>You're helping us eat and sleep!</b></p>
<p>Cast and crew are generously giving all they can of their time to make this happen. Many are doing it for next to no pay (I am so grateful.) Good meals make for a happy team!</p>
<p>Help us provide clean, safe, and comfortable beds after a 12-hour day of filming!</p>
<p><strong>EQUIPMENT</strong> - Lights and camera and all the things needed to make a movie look great! We are borrowing as much as we can from the UCLA School of Film. The rest of the equipment will be rented from professional equipment houses in Los Angeles. </p>

<h2>THE GOAL is $30,000! </h2>
<h3><strong>I need your help to make this happen!</strong></h3>
<p>Making a film is a costly endeavor.  As a graduate student, funds are even tighter and we receive no financial support from UCLA. I have worked hard to get the best-of-best on my crew.

<h2><strong>What is Ellipses and Semicolons?</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Think Dazed and Confused Meets The Big Chill - Or Fast Times at Ridgemont High in College</strong></p>
<p><i><b>Ellipses and Semicolons</b></i> follows five best friends struggling to come-of-age before their last semester in college. As the clock of collegiate safety winds down and ambitions collide in hilarious and heartwarming episodes, will <b>Luzette,</b> <b>Declan</b>, <b>Anson</b>, <b>Kellen</b> and <b>Page</b> be able to keep their friendship intact?

<p><i><strong>Our goal is to release the movie after film festivals in early 2023!</strong></i></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>CHARATERS:</strong></h2>
<h3>Luzette</h3>
<p>A goth middle shooter who never quite outgrew it, Luzette is a passionate filmmaker at a college with no film program. Luzette fights against school bureaucracy and a dead-beat dad to make her senior thesis — a low-budget feature film. All the while reconciling her on-again, off-again dynamic with Declan. </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Declan</h3>
<p>A selfish pretty boy who's always gotten by on his charm and B- effort. Declan is forced to look inside himself for the first time in his life when his alcoholism hurts those closest to him. And he doesn't like what he finds. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Anson</h3>
<p>Anson faces a “quarter-life crisis” as he realizes that he's been training since age 10 to be a philosophy professor... but he doesn't like philosophers. He takes a vow of sobriety until he figures out his future at a house that uses any pretext for a party. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Kellen</h3>
<p>Kellen struggles to reconcile his black-sheep identity amidst his parents kicking him off the payroll. To solve his problems he launches his own business: Dank Sandwiches Inc. </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Page</h3>
<p>Page bails on his last semester college to honor his perceived true calling: becoming a real-life pirate in land-locked Utah. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Movies like this don't get made anymore. It's a damn shame, but it's the truth. But it's not because audience don't want them. It's because studios are scared to make anything without ""IP"" or super-stars that they can bank on. The Indie spirit lives on through stories like ours and supporter like YOU! We have to fight to get great Indie stories back on the movie menu!</p>
<p>This story features a unique subculture (the counter culture of Utah Valley) and includes a diverse cast and crew of talented people. The story portrays queerness without the stereotypes, shows the beauty of friendship, the hardship of addiction, and the comedy of coming-of-age (not in your teens anymore for us Gen-Z and Millennials) with comedy and good natured irony. </p>
<p>If you're tired of super hero movies, or just want some variety and original voices out there in the market (like the 90s!) then this film is for you! It's about characters. REAL PEOPLE! Who have opinions, make mistakes, and laugh along the way to adulthood. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Risks and Challenges</h3>
<p>Without your support, this movie wouldn't be possible. I am calling in every favor I can and putting nearly all of my personal money into the project (keeping enough to pay rent and afford Ramen noodles!) I am not doing this to make money, I am doing it to launch my career as a storyteller by bringing you a hilarious hang-out comedy. </p>
<p>Financing is our greatest challenge. This Indie Go-Go is essential. 100% of your contribution will go to the making of the film as laid out above. We are hard at work seeking private investors but the fact remains that without this money we will require another crowdfunding campaign to finish the movie by moving our post-production budget over to cover these costs. By contributing now, we get this move made and on your screens as quickly as possible!</p>
<p>We have an incredible team, a great cast (more coming soon, I promise) and I have worked all through the pandemic to prepare this film. </p>
<p>As of today though, we are scheduled, 90% cast, and planning this movie dreaming that your contribution will bridge the gap in our finances! Thank you!</p>

Welcome to ""The Great Awakening"" and thank you for being here! :) </p><p>Thank you so much for supporting the arts during this challenging time. The purpose of this film is to generate awareness of important facts and inspire our spiritual and cultural growth as a collective.</p><p><strong>“The Great Awakening” is a thriller/supernatural short film about men's mental health, in support of war veterans all over the world, with a spiritual and empowering message for humanity.</strong></p><p><strong>It tells the story of Sam, a war veteran suffering from PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder) who is on the verge of killing himself when a mysterious phone call causes him to question his fundamental beliefs about life.</strong></p><p>We are looking to crowdfund the cost of shooting (3-4 days in the jungle with a professional cast &amp; crew of around 15 people), post-production (editing, original music, sound mixing, color grading, special effects, etc) and festival submissions. The more money we raise, the better the film we can make. </p><p>The project is led by Lucas Jatobá, an Australian/Brazilian/Italian writer &amp; director based in Australia. Lucas´previous short film, ""Phenomenality"",  became an Official Selection at Flickerfest Int. Short Film Festival <strong>(Oscar®/Academy Award® and BAFTA® Qualifying, Australia, 2018)</strong> and has been recognized with the <strong>Audience Award at the DOC LA Festival® (Los Angeles, USA</strong>), among many other accolades. His work for the advertising industry received over 30 international awards, including 5 Cannes Lions®.</p><p>DISCLAIMER 1: <i>Some footage in the video and some images on this page are from the feature film ""Jungle"" (2017, Dir.

</h3><p><strong>Globally, about 354 million war survivors suffer from PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder) and every day an estimated 22 war veterans commit suicide. But what if they had the chance to expand their consciousness and connect deeply with their higher self? This is the connection that our film explores.</strong></p><p>Yes, these numbers are shocking and no one is talking about it. But you can help to change this story. Now, more than ever, mental health is screaming for our attention and awareness as a collective. We all share the same home, Planet Earth, and we´re all part of the same family - humanity.<br/><br/><strong>It is our responsibility to look after each other because when we help others to heal, we heal ourselves and we heal our collective consciousness.</strong></p><p>You can help us remove the shame and stigma surrounding men’s mental health, while bringing light to the dark side of living with PTSD and a message of hope to many people around the world.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1613347284/rbpqwjnaz4w6ftlnhk01.png"" src=""""/></p><p><i>Source: Our World in Data &amp; WHO (World Health Organization)</i></p><h3><strong>About the film</strong></h3><p><strong>Genre: </strong>Thriller/Supernatural</p><p><strong>Logline:  </strong>A war veteran suffering from PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) is on the verge of killing himself when a mysterious phone call causes him to question his fundamental beliefs about life.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1612414151/op20dfwkkkzzpcob8waj.png"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>Synopsys:</strong></p><p>Sam is a 33-year old war veteran who is a husband and a father of two young children.

Greg McLean) with Daniel Radcliffe<br/>Music in the video: “Dust” by Hans Zimmer</i></p></div>","A summary of the project Hello everyone! Welcome to ""The Great Awakening"" and thank you for being here! :) Thank you so much for supporting the arts during this challenging time. The purpose of this film is to generate awareness of important facts and inspire our spiritual and cultural growth as a collective.“The Great Awakening” is a thriller/supernatural short film about men's mental health, in support of war veterans all over the world, with a spiritual and empowering message for humanity.It tells the story of Sam, a war veteran suffering from PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder) who is on the verge of killing himself when a mysterious phone call causes him to question his fundamental beliefs about life.We are looking to crowdfund the cost of shooting (3-4 days in the jungle with a professional cast & crew of around 15 people), post-production (editing, original music, sound mixing, color grading, special effects, etc) and festival submissions. The more money we raise, the better the film we can make. The project is led by Lucas Jatobá, an Australian/Brazilian/Italian writer & director based in Australia. Lucas´previous short film, ""Phenomenality"",  became an Official Selection at Flickerfest Int. Short Film Festival (Oscar®/Academy Award® and BAFTA® Qualifying, Australia, 2018) and has been recognized with the Audience Award at the DOC LA Festival® (Los Angeles, USA), among many other accolades. His work for the advertising industry received over 30 international awards, including 5 Cannes Lions®.DISCLAIMER 1: Some footage in the video and some images on this page are from the feature film ""Jungle"" (2017, Dir.

No copyright infringement intended.DISCLAIMER 2: This project is not affiliated to any political party or social movement. It´s purely created out of the filmmaker´s imagination, with the intention to raise awareness to an important cause and touch people´s hearts.
  The purpose 
Globally, about 354 million war survivors suffer from PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder) and every day an estimated 22 war veterans commit suicide. But what if they had the chance to expand their consciousness and connect deeply with their higher self? This is the connection that our film explores.Yes, these numbers are shocking and no one is talking about it. But you can help to change this story. Now, more than ever, mental health is screaming for our attention and awareness as a collective. We all share the same home, Planet Earth, and we´re all part of the same family - humanity.It is our responsibility to look after each other because when we help others to heal, we heal ourselves and we heal our collective consciousness.You can help us remove the shame and stigma surrounding men’s mental health, while bringing light to the dark side of living with PTSD and a message of hope to many people around the world.Source: Our World in Data & WHO (World Health Organization)About the filmGenre: Thriller/SupernaturalLogline:  A war veteran suffering from PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) is on the verge of killing himself when a mysterious phone call causes him to question his fundamental beliefs about life.Synopsys:Sam is a 33-year old war veteran who is a husband and a father of two young children. After a serious incident while serving in Iraq, he developed PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder).After many years trying to cope with his pain and guilt, he’s now on his way to commit suicide in the woods. He discovers his compass is not working and his mobile phone is out of range. However, his phone rings and he receives a very mysterious phone call.When “the voice” reveals that he seems to know what Sam is planning to do, he gets paranoid believing it could be the CIA or Military Intelligence.As the story unfolds “the voice” starts to reveal information about Sam’s life that nobody knows, except him. All while sharing a spiritual message about the meaning of life, shattering all belief systems he had held for his entire life. Mood boardThrough Sam’s story, we’ll visit the darkest side of living with mental health issues like guilt, remorse, mental confusion, anxiety and a sense of worthlessness. In contrast to this darkness, “The Great Awakening” also presents one of those ""Aha!"" moments that can change our lives forever, transforming everything we once knew as reality and turning darkness into light.  You´re in for a wonderful ride!Let your own beliefs be challenged. Back this film to make it happen. What if you could talk to “a voice” who knows you better than yourself?What questions would you ask? What would you like to discover? Would you be prepared to learn the truth about your existence?Donate to see what Sam discovered about himself. Choose your perk now.  About the writer/director Lucas Jatobá. Why I want to make this film:Hi, my name is Lucas Jatobá, I´m 39 years old and I am the writer and director of  “The Great Awakening”.I had my own “Great Awakening” back in 2013, when I resigned from a successful career in the advertising industry to follow my dream of making films with a purpose. Now my mission and my dream are “to bring to life films & ideas that raise consciousness and inspire people to be the best version of themselves.” This inner shift was only possible through a deep process of self-immersion and self-awareness, and through my films, I want to inspire others to do the same. I believe that as a collective we have the power to co-create a new reality in which everyone is empowered to live in peace, truth, freedom, joy, love, and harmony with both ourselves and all other living beings on this beautiful planet, ultimately leaving a wonderful legacy for our children and grandchildren.We're producing this project 100% independently. I have been working on it for over a year without any kind of funding or grants. If you can, please back this project. Any help is greatly appreciated so we can continue working and deliver the final project to the world.Join me in this inspiring project and together we can make a positive impact in the lives of thousands of people like you and me. About writer/director Lucas Jatobá. Professional career:Holding 3 nationalities (Australian, Brazilian and Italian), writer/director Lucas Jatobá is a citizen of the world. In the last decade he has lived and worked on 3 continents, giving him deep knowledge and wisdom about what it means to be human.His short documentary “Phenomenality” (written and directed by, Australia, 2018) has been recognized with the Audience Award at the DOC LA Festival® (Los Angeles, USA, 2017) and became Official Selection at Flickerfest Int. Short Film Festival (Academy Award® and BAFTA® Qualifying, Australia, 2018), among many other accolades.His documentary series ""Divine Women"" (written/directed/produced by, Spain, 2020) aims to explain the shift in consciousness and the return of the Divine Feminine energy that our society is currently experiencing, told from the perspective of spiritual teachers who are pathing the way for a new paradigm on planet Earth.His fashion film “Love Yourself” (written and produced by, Australia, 2016), starring Ryan Corr and Sophie Lowe, went viral and won the People Choice's Award, along with nominations for Best Australian Film and Best Directing at the Australian Fashion Film Awards.Lucas has directed films for global brands like Sony, TomTom and Le Coq Sportif.You can help us to make this film, so together we can transform lives and make our planet a better place for ourselves and many generations to come. What you get | The PerksLike in a game, we are going to work with milestones.

There was the 2nd French Empire under Napoleon III, nephew of the legendary Napoleon who had nearly conquered the continent decades earlier. In central Europe the situation was chaotic with a number of rapidly changing German states. Prussia, under the ambitious King Wilhelm I and his chancellor Otto von Bismarck, was rapidly expanding through multiple wars (against Denmark and Austria) and by 1870 was in control of the North German Confederation. The Confederation encompassed Prussia and multiple other states like Brunswick and Saxony – and it had close ties with the German states in the south like Bavaria and Würtemberg. </p><p>Napoleon III and Wilhelm I had quite different ideas for the future power structure of Europe – to say the least – and in 1870 this came to a head. After Bismarck leaked the infamous Ems Dispatch to the press, France and the German States went to war. And this Franco-Prussian War would change Europe forever. <br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1625345710/idbeij9sdyqwfdkhy2ul.png"" src=""""/></p><h3>Beyond Sedan, beyond Bismarck</h3><p>Today, Bismarck’s manoeuvring leading up to the war and engagements like the Battle of Sedan or the Siege of Paris are often remembered and sometimes even mystified. But the War of 1870 (as it’s called in French) was much more than that: over 3 million men went to arms and more than 150,000 soldiers died during the months-long campaign. The fighting wasn’t just concentrated around Paris; the ‘Southern Army' under General von Manteuffel famously drove the French Army of the East, commanded by general Charles-Denis Bourbaki, into the mountains near the Swiss border. With the Battle of Havana and a French naval blockade, the war even had an often-overlooked naval front. </p><p>The ultimate defeat of the French Empire and the French Republic that emerged during the war, the proclamation of the German Empire in Versailles in 1871, and much more, are reasons enough to remember this important part of European history. The use of modern technology like trains and artillery and the rivalry between France and Germany that would fester until 1914 need to be examined to fully understand the lead up to the First World War. </p><p>For its 150th anniversary, the Franco-Prussian War has come back into the spotlight with new research and publications. We want to tell its fascinating story for a new generation using the newest research. In the most detailed documentary series about this war ever made (total run time planned: over 4.5 hours), you will experience the war through the eyes of the people that lived through it. </p><p><strong>We can only tell this story with your direct support. </strong></p><p>Neither the traditional broadcast companies nor TV stations would be suitable for our vision.

If we reach this goal, we will cover it week by week as well. Franco-Prussian War Documentary and Book The Franco-Prussian War (War of 1870) was one of the pivotal events of the 19th century. It paved the way for decades of Franco-German rivalry and it led to the creation of the German Empire and a new French Republic. Glory & Defeat tells the story of the Franco Prussian War week by week on YouTube exactly 151 years after the events. It’s time for the prequel to The Great WarIn the mid-19th century, Europe looked quite different than today. There was the 2nd French Empire under Napoleon III, nephew of the legendary Napoleon who had nearly conquered the continent decades earlier. In central Europe the situation was chaotic with a number of rapidly changing German states. Prussia, under the ambitious King Wilhelm I and his chancellor Otto von Bismarck, was rapidly expanding through multiple wars (against Denmark and Austria) and by 1870 was in control of the North German Confederation.

Raising the last 4,000 will go into post-production, music licences, film festival submissions and doing a Principal Cast photography shoot for posters.  It will also help fund getting a venue for a special premiere you get the opportunity to attend to with the cast and crew, after its run its festival circuit! 
We are very excited to get this film made and will be opening up further conversations on our social media @physiquefilm to bring awareness to the matter. We would love to have you join us on this journey and become a part of a larger conversation. If you cannot donate, please share the word, as our crowdfund ends on the 19th of November. 
I am Jennifer James, 22 years old, and the creator of Physique. My recent credit was an associate producer on The Nightriders and we exceeded our crowdfunding goal. I have a short film in Aesthetica Film Festival 2020 and am an Award-Winning Dancer. 
Also, on my project is Clair Gleave who is an Award-Winning TV and Film actress, dancer and choreographer. Check out her Youtube video for more: https://www.youtube.com/user/Clairabellx
Adam, producer, IMDb credits and currently worked on Sikh Soldier. 
Nitin, producer, IMDb Credits  
What inspired me to create this project was my own personal struggles with this matter, and also the urge to speak up.  Hopefully, it will inspire many other young dancers that they are more than their physique.
We have already generated interest from film festivals and production companies that wish to help us when we get it made, so if you are willing to help, any support you are able to give us is greatly appreciated. 
If you are interested in learning more, please keep reading and I hope you will support + join us on this journey.

Risks & Challenges

<h2>Story</h2>
<p>Paper Rat follows Jackie Dormer, a subpar musician moving into her mid-twenties, still trying to make her dream of being a singer-songwriter come true at each local open mic. After a particularly crushing performance, Jackie finds the key to her success in a back alley; a paper rat. Suddenly things Jackie can’t explain start to happen, first her life is disrupted, but then she’s given the final pieces to make her music connect with her coffee shop audiences. Coffee shops turn into a national stage, and Jackie finds herself in a whirlwind of a situation, all thanks to the mysterious paper rat. When the good times start to get out of hand, it makes Jackie pause -- what really are the intentions of this paper rat?</p>
<p>The film explores themes of creative dreams and naive dispositions, as well as how much the force of life can change situations on a dime. No one is prepared for where their dreams might take them, what the intentions are of those who help them, or whether they can handle what happens along the way. What if the key to the success of your self expression isn’t actually you?</p>
<p><br/>Paper Rat is a film that aims to capture both the absurdity and the realer-than-real implications of success and failure in its extremes.</p>

I’ve been obsessed with television and film for forever now and I can’t wait to share with you all what I’m working on.<br/> </p><h2>THE WHAT</h2><p><i>Man Cured</i> is a film that takes place right here in Brooklyn, New York. The story follows Lucas, a shy and sensitive 22 year old babysitter who often spends his weekends watching a precocious 7 year old named Freud. What’s set to simply be any other Friday evening is suddenly upended when Lucas arrives to discover a new babysitter named Frankie is already in the brownstone. What happens as a chance occurrence between two young men spirals into a weekend of self-discovery and acceptance. <br/> </p><h2>THE WHY </h2><p>The script is inspired both by my own self-journey and the people I’ve met since coming to New York. So many gay stories on screen hinge on a romance or a tragedy (or often both), and for my producer Alex and I, we’ve found that doesn't necessarily reflect that reality we live in. Sure, those situations exist, but so do all the little moments that leave lasting marks. We’re here to create and tell those unique, authentic stories that are actually worth the watch. </p><p><i>Man Cured</i> takes a slice-of-life approach to one weekend in our protagonist’s journey that opens his eyes to so much more. Part coming of age, part coming to terms, and part coming out, it’s a dramedy that tenderly takes you through the internal (and oft misdirected) rage that silently burns inside so many of us. <br/> </p><h2>THE LOOK AND FEEL</h2><p>In bringing <i>Man Cured </i>to life, I've found inspiration in various movies and TV shows, specifically Andrew Haigh's <i>Weekend</i>,<i> </i>Dee Rees' <i>Pariah</i>, Eliza Hittman's <i>Beach Rats </i>and yes... even <i>GIRLS</i>. Whether it be their intimate grit, happenstance encounters, or Brooklyn roots, they each feel etched into a shared understanding of what it means to be a young person figuring out who they are.</p><p>Color will also play a large part in distinguishing Lucas' world. From how it surrounds him to how he eventually embraces it, our soft hues of blue and purple will saturate in different scenes, creating an unmistakable aura.</p><p><strong>References</strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1620249737/smgbugtrzdg7iilalxue.png"" src="""" style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""/></p><p><strong>Color &amp; Tone</strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1620250572/negnjchjtvw3fin5tsrb.png"" src="""" style=""font-size: 24px;font-weight: 700;letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;""/></p><h2>

Where Native children were ripped from there homes and forced to assimilate into western culture. There many children faced sexual, physical and verbal abuse.Douk is film that touches on these subjects.Douk is a historical fiction drama that takes place in 1910. It tells the story of a young Native girl, Irene, who deals with a difficult reality of her and her sister being taken away from their family and sent to boarding school, where they will be assimilated into the western culture. This means that once this happens, they will no longer be able to practice their language, culture, and traditions. In order to prevent this from becoming a true actuality, Irene’s parents hatch a plan to save them.Inspiration for this StoryThis project was inspired by not only my great grandmother, who experienced these types of boarding schools, but other tribal elders’ stories in my community. For many years this has been a topic that has a hidden subject from general discussion in the United States. This is a subject that needs to be explored and discussed by the general public.The TeamWriter/Director - Michelle HernandezMichelle Hernandez is a Native American filmmaker and photographer. She is a Wiyot tribal member and grew up on the Table Bluff Reservation. She is currently pursuing her Masters in Film and Electronic Media at American University in Washington, D.C. She received her B.A. at Humboldt State in both Film and Native American Studies. Many of her work focuses on the importance of culture, traditions, and identity, as well as dealing with Native American subjects. With her work she wants to give voice to stories that help breakdown stereotypes. Producer - Courtney BrooksCourtney Brooks is a photojournalist, filmmaker, and scriptwriter who enjoys creating and watching films that bring awareness to true stories. Courtney has a BS in Biology from Spelman College and a MA in film and Video from American University. She believes that through film you can take any issue and make it feel more personal to those who may not be directly affected by it. She believes that if you can get people to see someone else's perspective, you can get them to care and get involved. That is the power of filmmaking for her and why she has dedicated her passion for film and photography to telling the stories that bring awareness, create conversation, action, and change. Courtney's future plans involve directing for documentaries as well as continuing her work as a photojournalist and scriptwriter.Producer - Carolyn SilvernailCarolyn Silvernail is a photographer, filmmaker, and musician. Born in Germany as an Air Force brat, Carolyn is now a military wife of an Army officer. Having lived in various countries and states in the US, she currently lives in the DC area with her husband and two cats. Carolyn has her BA in music performance from Millikin University, her BA in filmmaking from New Mexico State University, and an MS in Exercise Science and Health Promotion from California University of Pennsylvania. At present, she is working on completing her MFA degree in Filmmaking at American University with her thesis film, Before I Wake. Her future plans involve directing and working as a DP in the film industry as well as continuing her work as a photographer and digital artist. Assistant to Producer/Editor - Richard WenzlerRichie Wenzler is a Master of Fine Arts Candidate for Film and Electronic Media at American University. He’s finishing up on his thesis project Insomnia Nights. In the fall of 2012, Richie earned a B.A. Degree in both Telecommunications and Communications & Culture at Indiana University.

Most recently, Richie was a freelance editor for ACE Media and assisted on several projects of theirs. One of his works has been featured on sites including Sports Spectrum and ESPN. In addition, Richie has been involved in various film productions, and loves to collaborate with others. A lifelong fan of film, Richie hopes he can infect his energy of film to others.  Director of Photography - Ross GodwinRoss Godwin is an award-winning filmmaker from Washington, DC, and an MFA graduate of American University. A writer, director, and cinematographer, Ross has worked on a variety of different projects across genres and across the globe; from Alaska, to Czech Republic, from Mexico to the Isle of Saba, and everywhere in between.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Welcome to our fundraiser! thank you so much for checking out our page and giving us the opportunity to inform you about Godsend. Below we are briefly going to explain a little bit about us as a crew, give you an insight into the world of Godsend and what we hope you'll help us achieve, thank you:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Based</strong> in Brighton and London, our skeletal crew of filmmakers have a combined 70+ years on features, commercials, music videos and short films just like this one. We all came together after reading Godsend and fell in love with an ambitious, beautiful story set in a world full of horror and decay.</li>
<li>
<strong>THIS CAMPAIGN IS BIG</strong>. As a crew we sat down and worked out what it would take to create a post-apocalyptic world set in the English countryside full of Radiated humans and awe-inspiring set pieces, and we came to this conclusion. We could make it on £3k if we are focused and resourceful.</li>
<li>
<strong>We</strong> cannot express how much it means to us for you to support our goal. We've done the maths and this story is gonna be bigger than our budget when it hits the screens. So help us make something memorable, exciting and thrilling for all of you movie-goers and cinephiles.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We understand that investing money into the arts isn't often priority but we've listed what's needed, why and how you can make a change:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Our target</strong> is to raise £3k. This covers both cast and crew expenses, locations, amenities such as food and petrol to much cooler things such as hazmat suits, zombie make-up and a burnt bike pyramid the size of a house!</li>
<li>
<strong>So if you</strong> thought the last part above sounded cool, wait until you see what we have instore for you as rewards for your donations. We've got opportunities to be on set with us as a zombie, t-shirts, storyboards, screenplays and digital copies of the film!</li>
<li>
<strong>Our target</strong> is to raise £3k but a question that always lingers is, what happens if we don't get it? well we are lucky enough to keep what we raised to create a film on a smaller budget, this may mean smaller crew, less practical effects and locations, which seems like it'll be ok, but it effects the story massively, so help us in raising the precise amount and you'll get a post-apocalyptic thrill ride!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This is by far the biggest film we've ever made and that's why you have such a monumental part to play. Here's a few reasons why it's important to us that you help us.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Supporting </strong>our film encourages others to support us, be it financially or practically.</li>
<li>
<strong>Previous</strong> to Godsend, we were successful in campaigning for both of our other short films and we couldn't have done that without you. Both of which won awards and encouraged local businesses to help us with cheaper kit hires and locations for free!</li>
<li>
<strong>Short</strong> films are a gateway for local filmmakers to be recognised for our talents, which raises our profiles for future works and potential finance for projects down the line.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We understand that this is a huge, ambitious fundraiser but that summarises our story too. From monolithic practical's to large groups of actors on screen, Godsend demands to be fully realised and that comes with challenges. Below, we have listed a few:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Large-scale</strong> set designs require financial aid and the hands to produce it. Our director has donated a large amount of his own money to push funding for this film. Practical set designs are crucial to make this world believable and authentic. We are also lucky enough to have an expert set-designer on the team who is already underway with planning and scheduling props and materials.</li>
<li>
<strong>A</strong> two-day shoot to create such a diverse world is challenging and time constraints are plenty. To prevent delays we have scheduled our locations to be within short distances from each other and scenes that require less crew means spare hands can prep the next location.</li>
<li>
<strong>Practical</strong> effects such as prosthetics are costly and time consuming but we have a team of highly skilled Make-up artists on standby to create beauty in the ugly.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand that some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't support us in other ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about our campaign.</li>
<li>Remind them to use the Indiegogo share tools so that our campaign is recognised.</li>
<li>Share our social media posts on Instagram, Facebook, our website and Indiegogo.</li>

<h3><u>Budget we hope to achieve</u></h3>
<p>With this dark little story I've created, I want to pull on people's emotions and take them away from their own headspace into Johnathan's world and his day-to-day life.

What will they find at the edge of sanity?THE STATEMENT is a short film adaptation of H.P Lovecraft's spine-chilling story 'The Statement of Randolph Carter'.Summary: Dishevelled and exhausted, an unreliable prisoner recalls the terrible events which transpired in a cave to two inquisitive police detectives, as they investigate a local disappearance.  This is a unique short film within the Psychological Horror / Cosmic Horror genre. THE STATEMENT is a film that explores themes of Sanity, Cosmic Indifference, Existentialism, Detachment and more. Although THE STATEMENT is based on the original H.P Lovecraft story 'The Statement of Randolph Carter', our crew are bringing our own unique vision and sensibilities to the story, whilst respecting and staying true to the original work's intentions, aesthetics and themes. What Inspired The Film?Besides the original story, many other works of art have inspired the overall tone of the film we're developing. Some of these inspirations are:THE WITCH (2015) | PULSE (2001) | WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT KEVIN (2011) | ANNIHILATION (2018) | THE LIGHTHOUSE (2019) | YOU WERE NEVER REALLY HERE (2017) | NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN (2007) | THE SEVENTH SEAL (1957) | THE THING (1982) | 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (1968)The CharactersVernon:Our unreliable narrator, Vernon has always been an outsider and feels like he doesn't belong around anyone. His mysterious and troubled past haunts him. He fears getting attached to people.  The dream person to cast for Vernon is Chiwetel Ejiofor.Stanley:A mysterious and oppressive patriarch figure, Stanley’s quest into the cave seems to be one of redemption. His relationship with Vernon is strange, however, the origin of the book of unknown horrors he has is even more bizarre. The dream person to cast for Stanley is Jake Gyllenhaal.Detective Roth:A respectful and collected detective, Roth is a very malleable person who always wants to uncover the truth, no matter the cost. The dream person to cast for Detective Roth is Henry Fonda.Detective Doyle: A grizzled and confrontational person, Doyle believes in justice above all else. He lets his anger and passion get the better of him. The dream person to cast for Detective Doyle is Philip Seymour Hoffman.The LocationsInhuman and cosmic horror beyond human comprehension could lay dormant with our locations...however, we're pretty sure they don't! There are only two locations necessary for us to make this film - a police interview room and a cave. Thanks to the Great Old Ones, we've already managed to organise our locations. Here is the room which we will be turning into our police interview room.The image is a test shoot with some of our crew members. Our Art Department Lead - Ellen - is working hard to transform this room into the creepy and claustrophobic police interview room.Here is the location of the cave.We've managed to get access to Yordas Cave, North Yorkshire to allow us to film inside and outside of the cave.  This cave and the surrounding landscapes will make the disturbing and horrific events that will unfold in the film even creepier!These incredible locations ensure that THE STATEMENT will have very authentic and bone-chilling visuals to complete the Lovecraftian horrors of the narrative. The PropsProps and Costumes are incredibly important to THE STATEMENT as we want everything to appear rustic, eroded and authentic to the audience and the characters in the film. Many props will feature within the film, however, none hold more significance and importance than the 'Necronomicon'. Described in the screenplay as ""weathered pages with scribblings that resemble runic symbols from Old Norse, comparable to hieroglyphs from ancient Egypt.

<h2><strong>STORY</strong></h2>
<p>Thank you so much for showing interest in our project. My name is <a href=""https://antolix.com/about-me"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Antonio Oliveros-Nikol</a>, I am the writer and director of <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13242864/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Meet Natasha</a>, a 12-minute thesis short film I produced and directed to fulfill a graduation requirement at The City College of New York.</p>
<p>The film tells the story of Marco Lombardi (<a href=""https://www.jarredharper.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Jarred Harper</a>), a man hires an out of work actress (<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm12302009/?ref_=tt_ov_st"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ankah Bello</a>) to play his fiancé during a family dinner, but his plans go awry when she decides to go off-script.  Although mainly a comedy, the short has a strong message about bigotry and the importance of being proud of who we are, regardless of what other people think.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>WHAT WE NEED &amp; PRODUCTION STATUS</strong></h2>
<p>We wrapped principal photography on the film (including re-shoots and pickups) in late March of the year, and we already have a rough cut of the film.  We were able to secure $10,000.00 through different grants and private contributions, which we fully used to fund the pre-production and production  part of the project.</p>
<p>What we need at this time is a little help raising approximately $3,000.00 to fund the last stage of the post-production process, which includes color correction/grading, sound editing/mixing and scoring.  Any additional funds raised will be used to submit the project  to various film festivals across the country.  No donation is too small. Even $1 will bring us closer to reaching our goal.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>WHY THIS PROJECT IS SO IMPORTANT TO US</strong></h2>
<p>COVID-19 forced me and my classmates to spend our Junior and Senior years at home learning the fundamentals of film production virtually. This not only stifled our interaction with each other and the film community at large but put a huge stress on the learning processes behind creating a successful film. <i>Meet Natasha</i> represents a triumph under these intense circumstances. Although limited in scope, due to pandemic restrictions, this production was able to move forward and capture the spirit of the script that I had worked so hard to create over many years. Many of my classmates devoted their time and skills to make this production a success and for us,  this production represents  a culmination of the hard work that we had put in for years to receive our degrees in film. Completing this film  will guarantee that me and my fellow classmates will get recognition in another forum for  our  hard work and perseverance through such unfortunate circumstances. Your kind donation will help ensure that this film gets seen by the widest audience possible and give all those involved a chance to truly showcase our talent, and with your generous help, “Meet Natasha” will get the showcase that it truly deserves .  Thank you again for your interest.</p>
