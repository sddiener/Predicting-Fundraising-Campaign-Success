<p>Hi, my name
is <b>M</b>arcus <b>A</b>nthony <b>N</b>esby, Age 14, entrepreneur and aspiring CEO of
StikMAN Apparel. </p>
<p>In my short life, I have enjoyed the thrills and wonders of
active outdoors sports such as skateboarding, snowboarding, motocross, and most
recently Lacrosse.  </p>
<p>In 2011, when I was
only 11 years old, I came up with the idea that I wanted to design extreme
sport apparel.  Since then, I have
created several logo(s) and mass produced articles of apparel including caps,
beanies and t-shirts for fun and to hand out to teammates and friends.  Recently, I created a logo for Lacrosse.  I chose Lacrosse because I have been
playing the sport of Lacrosse for the last 4 years.  Lacrosse is a sport that is rapidly
gaining momentum on the West Coast and I would like to take advantage of the
movement and my creativity. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>What is Behind the
StikMAN Name/Logo?</b></p>
<p>The sport of Lacrosse involves using a stick.  And… as many of you parents out there know
this…  The body build of many young
teens, as they make their way into manhood, is stick-like in form.  So Yes, you guessed it.  I am a thin build young teen making my way
into manhood and <b>M.A.N.</b> are my
initial.</p>

Hi, my name
is Marcus Anthony Nesby, Age 14, entrepreneur and aspiring CEO of
StikMAN Apparel. 
In my short life, I have enjoyed the thrills and wonders of
active outdoors sports such as skateboarding, snowboarding, motocross, and most
recently Lacrosse.  
In 2011, when I was

The sport of Lacrosse involves using a stick.  And… as many of you parents out there know

What We Need & What You Get

 I will need about $8,000 in
order to break StikMAN onto the market. That will includes marketing,
materials, labor and related expenses for designs and production.

<p>As for me (a cancer survivor), I am starting a Portable Locker Company designed to provide secured locker
storage for participants typically supportive of these <i>Give Back Events</i>.  There will
be 500+ storage lockers plus 120 cell phone charging lockers inside the Hot
Pink, big-box truck for their use.  The pricing will range from $5 to $20 (S, M, L, XL). With event sponsor participation, these lockers can be FREE to the participants! </p>
<p><b>Our ask:</b>  Your <u>one-time</u>

120 cell phone charging lockers, 650 combination locks, a generator, lighting
for the interior of the truck box, the services of a welder and painter, the paint and the metal, plus advertising

Risks & Challenges
 

By being aggressive in our pre-launch, a big challenge now is the number of events that are encouraged by our service and our ability to deliver in a timely manner.  We are working with suppliers to 'fast start' our locker order when we receive the Indigogo funding.

Challenges will also be in asking current event sponsors to pony-up a few more bucks thereby allow the runners for the event-cause(s) to run for free versus paying themselves.   We will be asking the event sponsors to assist us with contacting the sponsors and encourage them to assist. 

With 20-30 running events per weekend, every weekend of the month (in Texas alone) the challenge will be to remain focused and stay on point, not over extending our assets.

Original Design- available in 2 different models in 6 el wire color options (blue, green, pink, red-orange, white, & yellow)Who is LIFT...LIFT – is a consumer electronics developer
that converges style with technology.  Our primary focus is in the
music/audio industry where our mission is to produce the most ground-breaking
& fashion-forward products on the market.  The LIFT team
has been integral members to projects that introduced world’s first
fashion/colored headphones; as well as iPhone cases featuring patented functionality,
high-end video game peripherals, state-of-the-art 3D glasses, and numerous
other consumer electronic products focused around fashion & function. 
Some of our past and current retailers include: Amazon, Costco, Best Buy,
Guitar Center; as well as numerous international retailers in over 35
countries.How LIT was born...It
started with an idea that both fans and artists at music and other live events
deserve not only better products but also an incredible experience!Our
mission from the very beginning was not only to create a unique
and stylish product, but also devices that are interactive allowing fans
to be engaged with the production at shows as well as with one
another.Concept PhaseWe started from scratch to engineer and develop this one-of-a-kind solution and technology that had previously never existed.R&D PhaseKnowing the R&D phase was going to take a significant amount of time and investment we also started out by simultaneously selling our hand-made model strictly at events.  This provided us the opportunity to get in front of and interact with fans firsthand so we could gather critical feedback and input that was essential in our efforts to develop the most gratifying product possible.Beta PhaseThorough testing was performed to ensure LIFT’s strict
quality and standards levels were met before finalizing our current product,
and after two challenging years of research and development we were elated with
the completion of our 1st generation design and technology!.Testing PhaseLaunch!Launched
in Summer ’13 by partnering with industry leaders by licensing our exclusive
technology and products to key brands, events, & artists with custom designs
and limited edition versions
And now it’s your turn to…GETLIT!
Future Looks Bright with LIT...
Now that we’ve successfully finalized our core technology
and 1st generation design we are continuing on our mission to ensure
we offer the most advanced products and innovative technology on the
market.  Following our previous
development processes and experience, LIFT has utilized our team’s expertise to
create groundbreaking new models and solutions.
NEW DESIGNS
Our new designs advance our current models design by making
the entire frames structure and housing for the electronic components sleeker
and, which is made possible by the minimization/shrinking of the electronic
components and upgrading the PCB & battery to provide the most efficient
and optimal performing components available
NEW TECHNOLOGY
new technologies will allow us greater design potential,
more advanced features, and one of our favorite features which is the ability
to create a coordinated live environment and immersive performances to take
each new experience to the next level
Currently working with some of the biggest events and
artists to finalize our tech solutions that will be integrated into the
production of their shows Why GETLIT...
Your support will provide us the opportunity to get these
incredible new designs to you and the rest of the LIT Community…in a far more
expedited manner and with the highest quality standards possible/ensuring we
can provide every one of our customers/fans with the premium quality and
design, as well as advanced technology available on the market

While it isn’t’ imperative for this campaign
funding for our business to survive, as we have been operating for over 2 years
developing our products and the technology that is now available, it is
critical to our ability to expand and reach our vision of making
incredible/groundbreaking products we think you deserve!",40.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Who / Why?</h3>

Vibrant Eye Clothing is run and managed completely by me. Because of this I'm able to offer some of the highest quality products at lower prices than my competitors.</p>
<p>My biggest issue so far has been limited inventory and my lack of capital. Also, because it takes 3-4 weeks to get new inventory after I place an order it can be a slow process to keep the most popular designs and sizes in stock. </p>

<h3>About the Clothes</h3>
<p>I've taken the time to find a manufacturer that makes some of the highest quality clothes. Everything is made out of <b>super soft polyester</b> and it mimics the feel of cotton. Each item is printed using full dye sublimation, and the design covers front and back. Vibrant Eye products are <b>moisture wicking, dry super fast, are wrinkle resistant,  will NOT fade or shrink</b>, and all the space/psychedelic designs<b> look amazing under blacklight</b>. Plus they don't have the white lines or smudges that many other sublimation products have. <span><br/></span></p>
<blockquote>""Top notch tank for sure. I’ve gotten so many high fives and compliments for this shirt it’s awesome. The fabric is extremely comfortable, even after a grueling 8 hour festival, and wicks away sweat beautifully. Would definitely recommend.""</blockquote>

""Top notch tank for sure. I’ve gotten so many high fives and compliments for this shirt it’s awesome. The fabric is extremely comfortable, even after a grueling 8 hour festival, and wicks away sweat beautifully. Would definitely recommend.""
""Just received this today and it’s instantly my new favorite shirt! It’s super comfy and the design is phenomenal! I’m really excited to get bombarded with compliments!""

I have had a couple successful crowdfunding campaigns in the past and have hundreds of  happy customers around the world. This isn't something that I've quickly thrown together, it's something that I have lots of experience and knowledge in. I strive to provide the best possible product and the best possible experience to you, the customer.

<h2><strong>Hi there! Hi there! Hi there! Hi There! </strong></h2>
<p>Welcome Waldenites! We’re the Surfers of 2002. With all the spare time we had in 2020, we  decided to put the hours we spent in Arts &amp; Crafts (OH YEAH!) to good use. We’ve lovingly designed and produced a set of 5 enamel pins, featuring some of your Walden favs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Iconic Walden Shorts</li>
<li>Orange Tie</li>
<li>Schnecken</li>
<li>Walden Sign</li>
<li>W Pennant </li>
</ul>
<p><br/>Whether you want to add them to your orange tie or rock them on a jean jacket, these pins will surely add some much needed pep and spirit to your day! </p>
<p>A few additional details about the pins: Each soft enamel pin is 1.25” and has a 8mm post Butterfly Clutch backing. The metal color is Polished Black Nickel. </p>
<h2><strong>Something New in 04022</strong></h2>
<p>Camp Walden launched the Something New in 04022 campaign in 2020 to invest in the future of our favorite place. Each pin set purchase will directly benefit Camp Walden’s fundraiser and will subsidize the cost of production, shipping, and packaging (approximately $17.30 per set).</p>
<h2><strong>Honor System</strong></h2>
<p>We have only produced 95 pin sets to start. While the offer is fairly exclusive, we want the price point to be accessible to all. However, the intention is to raise as much money as possible for Something New in 04022. We’ve created a few pricing tiers so everyone has the opportunity to get in on these super fun donation perks. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Current Camper</strong> - You’ll be rocking the pins on your orange tie this summer and you’ll donate $42* to Walden.</li>
<li>
<i><strong>Young Alum</strong> - You were Bunk 12 within the last 10 years and are looking for a way to spruce up your WFH look. You’ll be donating about $56* to Walden. </i>[No longer available]</li>
<li>
<strong>Pin Pal</strong> - Whether you’re buying a set for you, your campsister, or another alum, you’ll be sending nearly $70* to Walden Drive.</li>
<li>
<i><strong>Power Tower</strong> - You’re pumped about the pins, but even more excited to offer $120* to the Something New in 04022 fundraiser.</i>  [No longer available - but feel free to donate!]</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>We will not be checking IDs, but hope you’ll choose the tier that makes most sense for you. Remember, it’s a system based on unity and trust! </p>
<p>*This subtracts cost of set, packaging, delivery fees, and IndieGoGo fees.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://www.makefashion.ca/makefashion-spotlight-illuminated-vintage/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Illuminated Vintage” </a>collection features bright classic dress designs, and accessories such as a paracel, a feather fan, fascinators, and hats that all react to, sound, touch, movement, or the wearers pulse. Almost all of the garments are using cutting edge wearable technology developed by<a href=""http://www.seeedstudio.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> Seeed Studios.</a></p>
<p>Since the 2014 show, many of the outfits themselves have been presented at MakerFaire’s and wearable tech events, in San Francisco, Calgary, and Shenzhen, China. Sadly we the designers have never been able to travel with the “Illuminated Vintage” collection on these showcase adventures. Although to our excitement, through MakeFashion we have been invited to attend the <a href=""http://www.makerfairerome.eu"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">2014 Rome Maker Faire</a> with our collection. This would be the first time we will actually get to attend a MakerFaire event with our pieces, allowing us to experience the audience’s reaction, and answer questions about our work. This and more will all be possible with your assistance!</p>
<p><b style=""font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;"">On a Personal Level...</b><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Attending this event will definitely be inspiring for both of us. Allowing us to see and learn about new technology while meeting industry experts and interacting with other designers. Also on an exciting note, we have been accepted to exhibit at the 2015 MakeFashion event. What we see and who we meet in Rome will undoubtedly allow us to grow as designers and shape our already amazing project ideas for next year!</p>

A very big thank you to everyone who supported and shared our campaign! We are thrilled that so many people share our dream of a safer world.

<b style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: initial;"">The Basic Idea </b><br/>
</h2><p><b>What is Safelet?</b></p>
<p>When you need help, you can use Safelet to send an alarm to your friends, family and the police with your exact location.</p>
<p>Your security is enhanced at multiple levels :</p>
<p>1 – The simple activation of Safelet allows you to send out an alarm even if you have very little time. Something which would not be possible using your mobile.</p>
<p>2 – With one simple click you can notify a wide network of people. We like to call these people your guardians. You can make your network as big as you want. First of all by inviting all your friends and loved ones into your guardian network. But if you want an even bigger network, Safelet can send your alarm to everyone in the Safelet Community in your vicinity.</p>
<p>3 – Safelet provides your exact location to the police which, in many countries, they can not obtain otherwise.</p>
<p>Safelet creates a platform which allows safety to become something we create together. Hence our slogan, Safety is what we do for each other!</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/625763/files/20140604092807-infographic-1.png?1401899287"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/625764/files/20140604092819-infographic-22.png?1401899299"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/636963/files/20140609151140-Infographic-3.png?1402351900"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p></p><p>Safelet works with the Safelet app on iOS and Android. The Safelet app is used to establish a Bluetooth low energy connection between Safelet and your smartphone.</p>
<p>Once Safelet and your phone are connected, you can use the app to invite your friends and family to become your guardians.</p>
<p>If you want to be protected by an even bigger network, simply select the the option that enables your alarm to be sent to other people in the Safelet Community that are, at the moment of the alarm, close to you.</p>
<p>From now on you are connected and protected by people who will be there when you need help.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/620547/files/20140602094827-wings.jpeg?1401727707"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><h2><br/></h2><h2>The perks </h2><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/657739/files/20140618073753-Perks_All_gone.png?1403102273"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3>New perks! </h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/657749/files/20140618074355-3x.png?1403102635"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/657753/files/20140618074617-6x.png?1403102777"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p><br/></p><h2>
<b style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: initial;"">Why did we develop Safelet?</b><br/>
</h2><p>There is (sexual) violence against women. We knew that. But we were shocked by its epidemic dimensions. It started with a small article in Amsterdam newspaper ‘Het Parool’. It stated that each day 2 women reported an incident of sexual assault. The police expected the numbers to be 4 times higher. We were astonished. Why aren't the individual cases front page news every day? Why the silence? </p><p>Two studies, one conducted by the World Health Organization and one by the European Union, showed statistics that truly opened our eyes. Almost 35% of all women, regardless of where they live, experience sexual assault (source: <i>World Health Organization, Factsheet No.239</i>, October 2013). More than 50% of all women make decisions that restrict their freedom of movement. No stroll through the park, not working late in the office, not taking the shortest route (source: <i>Violence against women, an EU-wide survey</i>, FRA, March 2014)</p><p>Sometimes an individual case gets the attention all cases would deserve, often because of its extreme brutality. The case of the Indian girl, known under the pseudonym Damini, has always been on our mind (source: <i>Indians on outrage over rape in moving bus in New Delhi</i>. The New York Time, December 18, 2012).</p><p>It’s out of love for our daughters, sisters, friends, co-workers and mothers that we have created Safelet. If we are willing to make Safety something we do for each other, we can create a safer world for women. </p><h2></h2><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/626462/files/20140604145327-girls_with_different_safelet.png?1401918807"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h2>

<p>A wearable safety device like Safelet, is only useful if it is worn. We wanted to ensure we could design an elegant and stylish device that people would want to wear. This created a challenge for us: how do we fit in all of the technology we need, while keeping the design sleek and elegant. Too many wearable electronic devices look like bulky gadgets , and that was the sort of design we wanted to avoid. We ended up partnering with leading manufacturers of Bluetooth radios and electronic components to miniaturize our design and ultimately produce a beautiful design you will be proud be wear. </p>
<p><b>Component lay out </b></p>
<p>Our design concept is based on a stack design, centered atop a curved lithium ion rechargeable battery. Above that sits our primary circuit board which carries our radios, microphone, charge controller circuitry, a notification light, and connections to the emergency switches. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/625766/files/20140604092931-4-build-up2.png?1401899371"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p>
<p><b>From the ground up </b></p>
<p>We started by designing a much larger proof of concept board, which carried radios and test points which allowed us to validate our design before trying to miniaturize it. Right from the start, we partnered with and worked out of engineering facilities with really great prototyping equipment and expertise. We were able to quickly develop a working functional prototype and knew we had something that worked. The challenge now focused on shrinking it down to fit a wrist. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/626411/files/20140604142725-making_work.png?1401917245"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Speaking of wrists, we found out that there are huge differences in wrist sizes. So we could forget about 'a one size fits all solution'. Especially because we didn't want Safelet to turn upside down whilst wearing. This would make it more difficult to activate the alarm. The solution lay in an adjustable milanese mesh wrist band that will fit 99% of all wrists.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/625769/files/20140604093039-7-Looking-into.png?1401899439"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p>During the entire process, we probably looked into 30 different designs. 29 of those could be discarded because they didn't meet the approval of our panel of 'wise women and girls'. They judged the early designs on one simple criterium: 'would I wear it?"".</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/625771/files/20140604093142-8-Early-Designs.png?1401899502"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/625772/files/20140604093207-9-First-3d.png?1401899527"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>The final model of Safelet has a slim and compact design. Choosing a metal housing instead of plastic allowed us to keep it very thin (0,35 inches or 9mm) without compromising strength and durability. With the adjustable milanese wrist band, the blind closure of the housing and the silverfish finish, Safelet's style refers right back to an archetypical bracelet.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/625773/files/20140604093258-11-Final.png?1401899578"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/626419/files/20140604143000-a_closer_look.png?1401917400"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Safelet app</span></b><br/></p>
<p>We wanted to keep the Safelet app as simple and easy to use as possible, while including the most important features. </p>
<p>The Safelet app is used to: </p>
<ul>
<li>set up an account </li>
<li>pair Safelet with your smartphone </li>
<li>invite and manage the people in your guardian network </li>
<li>turn 'on' or 'off' the possibility to make a call to the police </li>
<li>turn 'on' or 'off' the possibility of a sound alert on your smartphone once Safelet is activated </li>
<li>deactivate Safelet within 30 seconds in the case of a false alarm.  </li>
</ul>

<p></p></div>","Thank you!!!We are very excited that Safelet is now 100% funded (actually, 102%)!! A very big thank you to everyone who supported and shared our campaign! We are thrilled that so many people share our dream of a safer world. We will now get ready for all regulatory testing, finish the app and determine our production partner. To celebrate our success and allow even more people to benefit from our introduction discounts we have extended our campaign till the 9th of August!
The Basic Idea 
What is Safelet?
When you need help, you can use Safelet to send an alarm to your friends, family and the police with your exact location.
Your security is enhanced at multiple levels :
1 – The simple activation of Safelet allows you to send out an alarm even if you have very little time. Something which would not be possible using your mobile.
2 – With one simple click you can notify a wide network of people. We like to call these people your guardians. You can make your network as big as you want. First of all by inviting all your friends and loved ones into your guardian network. But if you want an even bigger network, Safelet can send your alarm to everyone in the Safelet Community in your vicinity.
3 – Safelet provides your exact location to the police which, in many countries, they can not obtain otherwise.
Safelet creates a platform which allows safety to become something we create together. Hence our slogan, Safety is what we do for each other!Safelet works with the Safelet app on iOS and Android. The Safelet app is used to establish a Bluetooth low energy connection between Safelet and your smartphone.
Once Safelet and your phone are connected, you can use the app to invite your friends and family to become your guardians.
If you want to be protected by an even bigger network, simply select the the option that enables your alarm to be sent to other people in the Safelet Community that are, at the moment of the alarm, close to you.
From now on you are connected and protected by people who will be there when you need help.The perks New perks! 
Why did we develop Safelet?
There is (sexual) violence against women. We knew that. But we were shocked by its epidemic dimensions. It started with a small article in Amsterdam newspaper ‘Het Parool’. It stated that each day 2 women reported an incident of sexual assault. The police expected the numbers to be 4 times higher. We were astonished. Why aren't the individual cases front page news every day? Why the silence? Two studies, one conducted by the World Health Organization and one by the European Union, showed statistics that truly opened our eyes. Almost 35% of all women, regardless of where they live, experience sexual assault (source: World Health Organization, Factsheet No.239, October 2013). More than 50% of all women make decisions that restrict their freedom of movement. No stroll through the park, not working late in the office, not taking the shortest route (source: Violence against women, an EU-wide survey, FRA, March 2014)Sometimes an individual case gets the attention all cases would deserve, often because of its extreme brutality. The case of the Indian girl, known under the pseudonym Damini, has always been on our mind (source: Indians on outrage over rape in moving bus in New Delhi. The New York Time, December 18, 2012).It’s out of love for our daughters, sisters, friends, co-workers and mothers that we have created Safelet. If we are willing to make Safety something we do for each other, we can create a safer world for women. 
What others say about Safelet 
Safelet design process
A wearable safety device like Safelet, is only useful if it is worn. We wanted to ensure we could design an elegant and stylish device that people would want to wear. This created a challenge for us: how do we fit in all of the technology we need, while keeping the design sleek and elegant. Too many wearable electronic devices look like bulky gadgets , and that was the sort of design we wanted to avoid. We ended up partnering with leading manufacturers of Bluetooth radios and electronic components to miniaturize our design and ultimately produce a beautiful design you will be proud be wear. 
Component lay out 
Our design concept is based on a stack design, centered atop a curved lithium ion rechargeable battery. Above that sits our primary circuit board which carries our radios, microphone, charge controller circuitry, a notification light, and connections to the emergency switches. 
From the ground up 
We started by designing a much larger proof of concept board, which carried radios and test points which allowed us to validate our design before trying to miniaturize it. Right from the start, we partnered with and worked out of engineering facilities with really great prototyping equipment and expertise. We were able to quickly develop a working functional prototype and knew we had something that worked. The challenge now focused on shrinking it down to fit a wrist. Speaking of wrists, we found out that there are huge differences in wrist sizes. So we could forget about 'a one size fits all solution'. Especially because we didn't want Safelet to turn upside down whilst wearing. This would make it more difficult to activate the alarm. The solution lay in an adjustable milanese mesh wrist band that will fit 99% of all wrists.During the entire process, we probably looked into 30 different designs. 29 of those could be discarded because they didn't meet the approval of our panel of 'wise women and girls'. They judged the early designs on one simple criterium: 'would I wear it?"".The final model of Safelet has a slim and compact design. Choosing a metal housing instead of plastic allowed us to keep it very thin (0,35 inches or 9mm) without compromising strength and durability. With the adjustable milanese wrist band, the blind closure of the housing and the silverfish finish, Safelet's style refers right back to an archetypical bracelet.Safelet app
We wanted to keep the Safelet app as simple and easy to use as possible, while including the most important features. 
The Safelet app is used to: 

set up an account 
pair Safelet with your smartphone 
invite and manage the people in your guardian network 
turn 'on' or 'off' the possibility to make a call to the police 
turn 'on' or 'off' the possibility of a sound alert on your smartphone once Safelet is activated 
deactivate Safelet within 30 seconds in the case of a false alarm.  

The Safelet app is pretty much still work in progress but below you can already some screens. 

Where we're at 
We have worked over a year on the concept, design and development of the first prototype of Safelet. We now have functional electronic prototypes. Our biggest challenge -'Safelet might not work'- has now been overcome.  We are almost ready for production and are finalizing our contracts with the suppliers.  At the same time, we are preparing for the final regulatory testing and determining what the best shipping method would be.  
Your Indiegogo Contribution 

Your Indiegogo pledge will allow us to get regulatory approval (FCC and CE), allow us to complete the first release of the Safelet app and, most importantly,  get our first production run in place. 
If we exceed our Indiegogo goal, our first step is to make Safelet customizable with different wristbands and covers.
We are serious about making the world a safer place for all us. And we believe that we can achieve that by simply looking out for one another - with a little help from technology.

<p>The Social Experiment</p>
<p>Fashion for Passion</p>
<p>Project:Beautiful Home</p>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong>Fashion</strong>-Social prominence especially as signalized by the arrangement or conduct of apparel, living space, or behavior.</p>
<p>Hello Everyone,</p>
<p>This is a challenge and an experiment; a social challenge to test the ability of individuals selflessness, and an experiment to see if we can pull this off! We; yes we, a leader is no one without his people and a challenge is nothing without opposition.</p>
<p>The rules are simple</p>
<p>1.  Can you make a <em>small</em> selfless act of kindness for a complete stranger without any payload for the benefit of another</p>
<p>2. Will you help me do it in a matter of days; forty-five.</p>
<p>3. We need to get 650,000 facebook fans and sponsors! We can do it, together!!!</p>
<p>Let’s do this!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Goal</h3>
<p>The goal here is to help raise money for the purchase of a beautiful home-in forty-five days-with only <strong>.50 cents </strong>as a basic contribution per individual.</p>
<p>Please, help me buy my first home</p>
<p>someone once told me you can't be helped if you don't ask,</p>
<p>Will you help me do it for the price of a soda can <em>o</em>r small bag of chips?</p>
<p>By pledging your support you’re changing my life!</p>
<p>By pledging your support you are creating The Boomerang effect</p>
<p>Good things done by good people always come back to them!</p>
<p>Happy Karma!</p>
<p>And don’t forget to share the link above on Facebook….</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Lets make it viral.....</p>
<p><em>Post the link for this campaign on Facebook, Twitter, G+1, and other social media</em></p>
<p>Help me get the word out,</p>
<p><strong><em>Other</em></strong> Contributions</p>
<p>Stick to the basics-the goal of this experiment is to see of we can meet it with very little funding and a great turn out of supporters and sponsors; however, if you wish to sponsor more than $<strong>.50</strong> you certainly can. Anything you give will be greatfully received, thank you.</p>
<p>Your contribution counts! That is a concept that will not be overlooked, <em>You</em> are the one who will make this possible.  Like a fiber woven into a thousand weaves in a blanket each fiber is as important to the whole as the other! <em>Together</em> we will succeed!</p>
<p>Thank you to all of my sponsors and supporters! All of the funds and attention are cherished above more than you will ever know: thank you for supporting this cause.</p>
<h3>Will It Work</h3>
<p>Will this work?</p>
<p><strong>.50 cents</strong> per contribution is pocket change but working together we can accomplish the goal,</p>
<p>The answer lies in the Marabunta.  The Marabunta, more commonly known as ""the army ant"", is a species of ant that has its origins in Africa.  It is one of the most successful ant colonies in existence and has the ability to accomplish colossal feats.  Once the army is on the attack it can be very difficult to deter this threat and everything in its path is consumed. </p>
<p>So what do the Marabunta and the social challenge have in common?  Well, the answer is simple.  The only way that the Marabunta are able to perform such massive raiding attacks is their strength in numbers.  The ants themselves are very small, but when acting in unison they form a tight-knit cohesive unit capable of accomplishing tasks thousands of times their capabilities as compared to the capabilities of only one individual ant acting alone in a raid.  So can we form a tight-knit cohesive unit working together to ensure the reserves of the social challenge are met.  </p>
<p>""Many hands make work light."" Using the maxim on the left and applying it financially:  It can be noted that one cent is hardly worth anything, present day, yet we cannot deny the fact that it takes one-hundred cents to value one dollar. Even that is of small value in today's economic market, but even the tallest building started with a foundation and building blocks on top of that foundation, one by one, helped complete the full structure.  The answer in its completeness is yes, the reserves of the social challenge will be met if we can work together.</p>
<p>Again, to all my supporters I thank you! Your help is making this possible!</p>

Other Contributions
Stick to the basics-the goal of this experiment is to see of we can meet it with very little funding and a great turn out of supporters and sponsors; however, if you wish to sponsor more than $.50 you certainly can. Anything you give will be greatfully received, thank you.
Your contribution counts! That is a concept that will not be overlooked, You are the one who will make this possible.  Like a fiber woven into a thousand weaves in a blanket each fiber is as important to the whole as the other! Together we will succeed!
Thank you to all of my sponsors and supporters! All of the funds and attention are cherished above more than you will ever know: thank you for supporting this cause.
Will It Work
Will this work?
.50 cents per contribution is pocket change but working together we can accomplish the goal,
The answer lies in the Marabunta.  The Marabunta, more commonly known as ""the army ant"", is a species of ant that has its origins in Africa.  It is one of the most successful ant colonies in existence and has the ability to accomplish colossal feats.  Once the army is on the attack it can be very difficult to deter this threat and everything in its path is consumed. 
So what do the Marabunta and the social challenge have in common?  Well, the answer is simple.  The only way that the Marabunta are able to perform such massive raiding attacks is their strength in numbers.  The ants themselves are very small, but when acting in unison they form a tight-knit cohesive unit capable of accomplishing tasks thousands of times their capabilities as compared to the capabilities of only one individual ant acting alone in a raid.  So can we form a tight-knit cohesive unit working together to ensure the reserves of the social challenge are met.  
""Many hands make work light."" Using the maxim on the left and applying it financially:  It can be noted that one cent is hardly worth anything, present day, yet we cannot deny the fact that it takes one-hundred cents to value one dollar. Even that is of small value in today's economic market, but even the tallest building started with a foundation and building blocks on top of that foundation, one by one, helped complete the full structure.  The answer in its completeness is yes, the reserves of the social challenge will be met if we can work together.
Again, to all my supporters I thank you! Your help is making this possible!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h2>About this Project</h2>
<p>The <em>Transformable Work to Carry-on Tote</em> is the first bag in a line of bags for professional women-on-the-go, entitled <strong>MINIM</strong>, to be released by CGC of NYC Accessories, LLC. This production order of 50 to 100 bags will be crucial inventory for the company's first trade show.  This small order will help facilitate PR opportunities and fill immediate small wholesale orders at the trade show.</p>

<h2>How The Product Came To Be:</h2>
<p>Hi, my name is Cheron Cowan and I am the product designer of the <em>Transformable Tote</em> and the owner/CEO of CGC of NYC Accessories, LLC. </p>
<p>The product came about from my travels as a working woman living in New York City and consistently having to commute out of state. One day while en route in an airport, I was stopped at the airline desk, yet again, and was asked to combine bags or pay a fee. This planted a seed that was further nurtured by the desire to have a bag that would adapt with my needs as a woman living in a small New York City apartment and lacking the appropriate storage space for myriad bags.</p>
<p>After completing four to five iterations of the bag over an eleven month period, testing each iteration for four or five weeks at a time, and vetting ten to fifteen different local manufacturers, I made this final prototype you see here on Indiegogo. (My sewing skills have been honed 10 times over as a result of making the prototype time and again.)</p>
<p>Initially, the goal was to manufacturer the bags here in the US. However, the last two local manufacturers that made a prototype encouraged me to seek a factory abroad as the price point per bag would be more economical.  I am now seeking a final sample from a factory I have well vetted and a small production order of 50 to 100 bags initially  for the Travel Goods Trade Show at the end of February in Las Vegas.</p>

<h2>How To Transform The Bag:</h2>
<p>First, it is important to note that the bag can be transformed while holding the cross-body strap and while in transit. So, the bag never has to be sat down in order for transformation. Also, the middle compartment, that has the pen and pencil holder and keychain, and the contents of the computer/tablet pocket do not have to be removed in order to transform the bag.</p>
<p>The steps for transformation are listed below.</p>

<h3>Why this trade show and why have a production order ready?</h3>
<p>The Travel Goods Trade show is one of the largest travel and luggage shows.  Originally, this bag was to launch at one of the big fashion trade shows, but as it is geared towards light travel (2 or 3 day trips) and everyday use, it made more sense to spotlight and launch the product there.  (it is also one of the more economical trade shows to participate in.)  Evenmore, while most wholesale orders will be placed in advance, having a small supply will help to have the bag located in various places through out the trade show (for PR purposes) and have a small quantity should someone want to purchase a small inventory for their shop or boutique immediately. As the trade show is in february and the holidays are approaching, their is a 3 week period in which the manufacturer has stated they will be closed.  So, it is imperative that both the factory samples and small production order is placed immediately.</p>

<h2>Risks and Challenges of Completing This Project:</h2>
<p>1) It was difficult enough to convey the project to local manufacturers (even with technical drawings AND a prototype). But, I have given a similar bag to the manufacturers vetted abroad for this project (with technical drawings) and the results were good. In addition, I have hired a sourcing company(not to be used from the funds I am raising) to execute what I might be missing in communication. This sourcing company went through critical analysis by both myself and my lawyer.</p>
<p>2) Manufacturers do not always deliver on time. I have purposely added a cushion of 30 days to what the manufacturer said they would deliver when they deliver. Also, post the holiday season, the factories are closed for 3 weeks respectively. This means production needs to start before the holiday season.</p>
<p>3) I have spent about $9,000 in research and development of this product of my own money. I would not ask someone else to invest what I would not invest myself.</p>
<p>Why Indiegogo?</p>
<p>Innovative products warrant an innovative approach. To launch this bag in the fashion industry, I have had people in the fashion business insist on 7 different bags for promotion of a line. Evenmore, when some of the people in the fashion industry have seen it, they were uncertain as to whether to categorize the product as a fashion accessory or luggage.... My intent is to bridge both:)</p>

<p>via a successful campaign we will be able to produce and stock our entire line.</p>
<p>the manufacturers are all in hand.  our new york team includes; jewelry, handbag, garment, plastic and rubber manufacturers.  all of the products have functional prototypes, which were perfected over the past 3 years.  a global fulfillment house is lined up for shipping, if it can't be handled in-house.</p>
<p>not knowing the total orders achievable via this medium, we are conservatively estimating production time at 3 months. inventory on all products can certainly be created and shipped within 2 months or less, but we are allowing extra time to ensure quality control. please keep in mind most of our manufacturers are local craftspeople normally working with designers and exclusive limited brands, not mass overseas producers.

<li>condom cover ... nothing worse than that circular indentation in one's wallet</li>
<li>pill case ... that's not flashy, pretentious, stupid, or cheap </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div><strong>my do-it-yourself attitude</strong></div>
<div><strong> </strong></div>
<div>working in architecture and real estate development, i have always created projects from scratch.  i am passionate about the process.  this project is certainly different, but there are parallels in the design process ... just that it's to the smallest detail.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<div><strong>helmut newton's influence</strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div>i've always been inspired by helmut newton's photography and i realize a lot of inspiration was drawn from his photographs when developing the designs of the product line.  imagine if helmut newton had to design accessories for muji.  hence the short film's inspiration as well.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><img alt=""helmut newton photograph vs blackbox"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://fbcdn-sphotos-e-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/1003448_165037883684503_928111086_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<div> </div>
</div>
<div><strong>aggressive marketing makes me nauceous</strong></div>
<div><strong> </strong></div>
<div>when i set out to create the boX brand, i wanted to do it my way.  somewhat like an anti-brand that could get not-for-profit religious tax status.  somehow that led into making a creative short film about a cat thief stealing my products.  extrememly subtle and hopefully entertaining.  i did not want to get the word out via typical marketing strategies, which would make me puke ... if you don't like what you do, why do it???  sidenote: i don't own a tv, as i cannot justify the interruptions of commercials (exception is the super bowl sunday).</div>
<div> 
<div>once i had the initial prototype made, i decided to throw caution to the wind and create some art!  i wanted to start building a feeling for my brand. i engaged my friend olivier french who is a film maker and owns viral cinema studio.  the result was 'black box'. the product was featured in a very subtle way.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>smells like art ... 'black box' our erotic film noir short, was an official selection at the <strong>cannes film festival</strong> in 2011 and at the <strong>la jolla fashion film festival</strong> in 2012.</strong></div>

</div>
<div> </div>
</div>
<div><strong>detail obsessed</strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div>countless designs and many very expensive prototypes later the entire line is finally ready to launch ... 3 years to achieve perfection.  the designs needed to be approved by the helmut newton in my head and worthy of the boX cat burgalr to steal.</div>

 delivery by Xmas :: perfect gift idea
our products are truly unique and instantly appreciated for their ingenuity alone.  our matchbox packaging is perfect for gifting.  many of you will actually cherish the packaging box and keep for other uses.  hence, we are selling the matchbox as a standalone product.  note the fxband and bottleglove are not packaged in these boxes.  still wondering what to get that special person who you think has everything ...


 please sir, i want some more
we realize you are design famished and in need ... to receive more than one perk, simply create additional contributions ... we apologize that the indiegogo system doesn't allow mutliple perks within one contribution. the 'you'll get nothing and like it' perk is really meant for people that want EVERYTHING on the menu, or a large combination of items. it's actually a quote from caddyshack.


 milestones
fortunately, we have many ideas ... unfortunately, not the funds to produce the entire line for launch.  all of the products have functional prototypes, which were perfected over the past 3 years ... all the designs are now prepared for manufacturing and the creation of inventory necessary to move forward efficiently.  the one exception is the blackbox.  we have perfected the protype, but have yet to tool the design for manufacturing.  tooling and manufacturing of the blackbox is an extremely expensive upfront cost.  therefore, we really need your help and are only able to offer the blackbox if we meet our $100k goal.
$100,000

3% of contributions will be donated to Human Rights Campaign
your contributions will let us truly launch the entire line of products.

$500,000

4% of contributions will be donated to Human Rights Campaign
only with contributions of 1/2 million dollars would i be able to recoup my initial financial investment ... and this would not even pay a penny towards the years of sweat equity ... and this is completely hypothetical, because i plan to reinvest the funds in the project ... this is a serious and committed endeavor ...  please do not let the artist within starve.

$1,000,000 [the true goal]

5% of contributions will be donated to Human Rights Campaign
supporters will recieve a very special gift
the top 9 individuals with the most referrals and deemed most influencial, will recieve the entire line of products! for more information on how indiegogo tracks referrals click this link

each city around the globe which was a major participant, will have a celebratory party and our supporters will be our vip guests





 the plan


via a successful campaign we will be able to produce and stock our entire line.
the manufacturers are all in hand.  our new york team includes; jewelry, handbag, garment, plastic and rubber manufacturers.  all of the products have functional prototypes, which were perfected over the past 3 years.  a global fulfillment house is lined up for shipping, if it can't be handled in-house.
not knowing the total orders achievable via this medium, we are conservatively estimating production time at 3 months. inventory on all products can certainly be created and shipped within 2 months or less, but we are allowing extra time to ensure quality control. please keep in mind most of our manufacturers are local craftspeople normally working with designers and exclusive limited brands, not mass overseas producers. WE ARE PREPARED TO HANDLE ANY QUANTITY OF ORDERS!!!



 what makes us tick
manifestoour underground effort applies creativity + passion to our daily routine, by producing minimalist 'daily essentials for the anti-conformist' tm.  with our design aesthetic, we are fighting visual pollution from the endless branding, product warnings and physique destroying bulk ... think of us as the anti-brand.

creativity + passionour ideals infuse every aspect of our products and also the way we spread the word … we want to continue the success of softly marketing ourselves and treating people with dignity and respect.  we do not see you as sheep to be manipulated.  we are already planning our next film shoot and additionally, we have a great interest in endorsing all types of artistic mediums in the future.  we want to create for and be supported by creatives!!!  hopefully this project will start a movement ... erasing neighborhood destroying billboards, film interrupted advertising, blazing logos, price tags derived from marketing efforts, not quality. let's take back our lives.

 my story [pierre]
i was never satisfied with the accessories on the market for many reasons.  perhaps, because i am detail obsessed ... many of you will likely relate to at least one of the drivers which led me to launch this product line.
 

love


design
quality
being discret, without changing who i am
being unique




dislike


bulk in my pockets
pretentious logos and labels
annoying tags
commercial advertising and blatant marketing
made in china




shopping list which was never resolved (until now)
key ring ... that's not annoying when wearing skinny jeans
daily bag ... androgynous, stylish, quality, unpretentious and fits my iPad
cigarette case/box ... camoflauged ... not drawing negative attention
money clip/band ... that's not flashy, pretentious, stupid, or cheap
underwear ... if calvin's not paying rent, my body's not another billboard
condom cover ... nothing worse than that circular indentation in one's wallet
pill case ... that's not flashy, pretentious, stupid, or cheap 


my do-it-yourself attitude
 
working in architecture and real estate development, i have always created projects from scratch.  i am passionate about the process.  this project is certainly different, but there are parallels in the design process ... just that it's to the smallest detail.
 

helmut newton's influence
 
i've always been inspired by helmut newton's photography and i realize a lot of inspiration was drawn from his photographs when developing the designs of the product line.  imagine if helmut newton had to design accessories for muji.  hence the short film's inspiration as well.
 

 

aggressive marketing makes me nauceous
 
when i set out to create the boX brand, i wanted to do it my way.  somewhat like an anti-brand that could get not-for-profit religious tax status.  somehow that led into making a creative short film about a cat thief stealing my products.  extrememly subtle and hopefully entertaining.  i did not want to get the word out via typical marketing strategies, which would make me puke ... if you don't like what you do, why do it???  sidenote: i don't own a tv, as i cannot justify the interruptions of commercials (exception is the super bowl sunday).
 
once i had the initial prototype made, i decided to throw caution to the wind and create some art!  i wanted to start building a feeling for my brand. i engaged my friend olivier french who is a film maker and owns viral cinema studio.  the result was 'black box'. the product was featured in a very subtle way.
 
smells like art ... 'black box' our erotic film noir short, was an official selection at the cannes film festival in 2011 and at the la jolla fashion film festival in 2012.



 

detail obsessed
 
countless designs and many very expensive prototypes later the entire line is finally ready to launch ... 3 years to achieve perfection.  the designs needed to be approved by the helmut newton in my head and worthy of the boX cat burgalr to steal.
 
early design drawings and mood boards

 
 
... and thus began my little fantasy range of products ... NOW I NEED YOUR HELP TO ACTUALLY MAKE IT HAPPEN ... after all i think that there is a little helmut newton in all of us.

<br/><h2><b>Vitrizia’s history</b></h2>
<p>Vitrizia is the abbreviation of my name: Patrizia Visone and it is my life experiences. I was born on the other side of the world in Sydney, from a family of Neapolitan artisans who always took care of fashion, the ""<b>Sartoria Visone</b>"", listed in the archives of Cultural Heritage between the 13 historical tailors Studios in Campania. </p>
<b><b>“If Vitrizia has fashion in her blood, the idea of hats is always been in her mind""!</b></b><br/><p>My creations come to life thanks to my passions for art and rock music, I’m  inspired by ""<b>Alice in Wonderland</b>"", the director Tim Burton’s visions,<b> the trilogy of ""Matrix"", the Doors,Pink Floyd, Depeche Mode.</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>I love the
colors and intense expressions of the world of Rock, Pop, Synth and especially
psychedelia. The product
of this vision represents an evocative,timeless and valid art/craft expression.
</p>
<p>My
challenge is to take my family historical legacy and keep saying : ""Who
has head, can’t miss hat .“ <b><b><a href=""https://goo.gl/photos/HtErtJcS2fH2cT7c9"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Click here to look photo Sartoria Visone</a></b></b><br/></p>

<b>Patrizia Visone</b>

<p>
</p>
<p>I graduated
as a Tour Operator, I decided to follow my passions starting to create the
front lines since the '90s alternating career to the family. Then I improved my
technique by taking a course at the <a href=""http://www.accademiamoda.it/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Accademia della Moda.</a> I have had so
many creative experiences through a professional and managerial path which
brought me last year to the incubator<a href=""http://www.vivaiodonna.it/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> Vivaio Donna</a>, where I compared to managers,
craftsmen and creative people. <b><b><a href=""https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B8tfe4_LyzKYZGRneUNaWjlURkE&amp;usp=sharing"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> </a><b><b><a href=""https://goo.gl/photos/6yuqL55RiSEqbFE18"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Click here to look photo Patrizia Visone Story</a></b></b></b></b><br/></p>
<h2><b>Why crowdfunding</b></h2>
<p>
</p>
<p>Crowdfunding
is a right answer across the market and the traditional financial system,
because it is based on personal values and conveys energy to those who need a
professional help. It is an harmonious and vibrating social system that cannot
leave you alone, where people can compare and create new collaborations. </p>
<h3><b>Why support me </b></h3>
<p>I ask you
to help me because I want to do business in Naples, to make a fashion network,
a place where one can share his own competence and esperience. </p>
<p><span>•<span>  </span></span>I ask for support
in order to be able to turn my passion into a job. </p>
<p><span>•<span>  </span></span>I ask for support
to prove that we can have our dreams back. </p>
<p><span>•<span>  </span></span>I ask for support
to give other people the same opportunity to pursue a dream like mine or
collaborate with me. </p>
<p><span>•<span>  </span></span>I ask for support
to give an opportunity to women who do not have a job to learn it with my help.</p>
<p><span>•<span>  </span></span>I ask for support
to continue and take the made in Naples brand abroad. </p>
<p><span>•<span>  </span></span>I ask for support
to create a network between the Neapolitan artisans of all ages</p>
<br/><h3><b>What are the funds for </b></h3>
<p>To start producing
and take part of trade fairs I need to create a company and start the early
stages. The funds raised will be used to: </p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Open a small company with its legal and administrative
obligations a <b>€ 3.500 </b></p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Start my e-commerce <b>€ 3.000</b> </p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Make a promotional campaign in key social media to
spread and show my products and create a catalog <b>€.
2.000 </b></p>
<p><b>The first
objective is € 8.500 </b></p>
<p><b>I hope, with your
help, to be able to achieve this first step and go further. </b></p>
<p>In this case I
would be ready to participate in an italian fashion trade fair : White 2016: <b>€ 3.000</b> </p>
<p>Finally I would
like to build up a <b>co-working</b> with
other colleagues who work in fashion and want to share spaces and
professionalism, as bloggers, designers, tailors, graphics. <b>€ 5.000</b> </p>

<p>Vitrizia Story</p>Vitrizia è l'acronimo del mio nome: Patrizia Visone e delle mie  esperienze di vita. Io sono nata dall’altra parte del mondo a Sydney da una famiglia di artigiani napoletani che da sempre si è occupata di moda, la “<a href=""http://siusa.archivi.beniculturali.it/cgi-bin/pagina.pl?TipoPag=prodente&amp;Chiave=54833"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sartoria Visone</a>”, custodita negli Archivi dei Beni Culturali tra le 13 sartorie storiche della Campania. Le mie creazioni prendono vita grazie alle mie passioni verso l’arte e la musica rock ispirandomi  a ""<a href=""https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_avventure_di_Alice_nel_Paese_delle_Meraviglie"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Alice nel paese delle meraviglie</a>"", alle visioni del regista <a href=""https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Burton"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tim Burton</a>, alla trilogia di ""<a href=""https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Matrix""</a>, ai <a href=""https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Doors"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Doors</a>, ai <a href=""https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Floyd"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Pink Floyd,  ai  Depeche Mode .</a><b></b><p>Adoro i colori e le espressioni  del mondo Rock, Pop, Synth e, in particolare la psichedelia. Il prodotto di questa visione rappresenta un’espressione artistico/artigianale evocativa, senza tempo e  di carattere.</p>
<p>“Se Vitrizia la moda ce l'ha nel sangue, l'idea dei cappelli l'ha avuta sempre in testa!”</p>
<p>Vitrizia è Il ""Cappellaio Matto"" che incorre in soluzioni inusuali, disegna e crea modelli unici. Sono un'artigiana che maneggia lane, fonde cromie e sfumature, creo insoliti accostamenti. Amo provocare e osare. La mia sfida è quella di proseguire la storia di famiglia per continuare a dire: “Chi ha testa non manca cappello!”. <a href=""https://goo.gl/photos/HtErtJcS2fH2cT7c9"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Click here to look photo Sartoria Visone</a></p>
<br/><h1>Patrizia Visone </h1>
<p>Diplomata come operatore turistico, ho preferito seguire le mie passioni iniziando a creare le prime linee sin dagli anni 90 alternando il percorso professionale a quello familiare. Ho poi migliorato la mia tecnica seguendo un corso modellismo presso l’<a href=""http://www.accademiamoda.it/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Accademia della Moda di Napoli</a>.

Vitrizia’s history
Vitrizia is the abbreviation of my name: Patrizia Visone and it is my life experiences. I was born on the other side of the world in Sydney, from a family of Neapolitan artisans who always took care of fashion, the ""Sartoria Visone"", listed in the archives of Cultural Heritage between the 13 historical tailors Studios in Campania. 
“If Vitrizia has fashion in her blood, the idea of hats is always been in her mind""!My creations come to life thanks to my passions for art and rock music, I’m  inspired by ""Alice in Wonderland"", the director Tim Burton’s visions, the trilogy of ""Matrix"", the Doors,Pink Floyd, Depeche Mode.


I love the
colors and intense expressions of the world of Rock, Pop, Synth and especially
psychedelia. The product
of this vision represents an evocative,timeless and valid art/craft expression.

My
challenge is to take my family historical legacy and keep saying : ""Who
has head, can’t miss hat .“ Click here to look photo Sartoria Visone

Patrizia Visone



I graduated
as a Tour Operator, I decided to follow my passions starting to create the
front lines since the '90s alternating career to the family. Then I improved my
technique by taking a course at the Accademia della Moda. I have had so
many creative experiences through a professional and managerial path which
brought me last year to the incubator Vivaio Donna, where I compared to managers,
craftsmen and creative people.  Click here to look photo Patrizia Visone Story
Why crowdfunding


Crowdfunding
is a right answer across the market and the traditional financial system,
because it is based on personal values and conveys energy to those who need a
professional help. It is an harmonious and vibrating social system that cannot
leave you alone, where people can compare and create new collaborations. 
Why support me 
I ask you
to help me because I want to do business in Naples, to make a fashion network,
a place where one can share his own competence and esperience. 
•  I ask for support
in order to be able to turn my passion into a job. 
•  I ask for support
to prove that we can have our dreams back. 
•  I ask for support
to give other people the same opportunity to pursue a dream like mine or
collaborate with me. 
•  I ask for support
to give an opportunity to women who do not have a job to learn it with my help.
•  I ask for support
to continue and take the made in Naples brand abroad. 
•  I ask for support
to create a network between the Neapolitan artisans of all ages
What are the funds for 
To start producing
and take part of trade fairs I need to create a company and start the early
stages. The funds raised will be used to: 
· 
Open a small company with its legal and administrative
obligations a € 3.500 
· 
Start my e-commerce € 3.000 
· 
Make a promotional campaign in key social media to
spread and show my products and create a catalog €.
2.000 
The first
objective is € 8.500 
I hope, with your
help, to be able to achieve this first step and go further. 
In this case I
would be ready to participate in an italian fashion trade fair : White 2016: € 3.000 
Finally I would
like to build up a co-working with
other colleagues who work in fashion and want to share spaces and
professionalism, as bloggers, designers, tailors, graphics. € 5.000

Vitrizia StoryVitrizia è l'acronimo del mio nome: Patrizia Visone e delle mie  esperienze di vita. Io sono nata dall’altra parte del mondo a Sydney da una famiglia di artigiani napoletani che da sempre si è occupata di moda, la “Sartoria Visone”, custodita negli Archivi dei Beni Culturali tra le 13 sartorie storiche della Campania. Le mie creazioni prendono vita grazie alle mie passioni verso l’arte e la musica rock ispirandomi  a ""Alice nel paese delle meraviglie"", alle visioni del regista Tim Burton, alla trilogia di ""Matrix"", ai Doors, ai Pink Floyd,  ai  Depeche Mode .Adoro i colori e le espressioni  del mondo Rock, Pop, Synth e, in particolare la psichedelia. Il prodotto di questa visione rappresenta un’espressione artistico/artigianale evocativa, senza tempo e  di carattere.
“Se Vitrizia la moda ce l'ha nel sangue, l'idea dei cappelli l'ha avuta sempre in testa!”
Vitrizia è Il ""Cappellaio Matto"" che incorre in soluzioni inusuali, disegna e crea modelli unici. Sono un'artigiana che maneggia lane, fonde cromie e sfumature, creo insoliti accostamenti. Amo provocare e osare. La mia sfida è quella di proseguire la storia di famiglia per continuare a dire: “Chi ha testa non manca cappello!”. Click here to look photo Sartoria Visone
Patrizia Visone 
Diplomata come operatore turistico, ho preferito seguire le mie passioni iniziando a creare le prime linee sin dagli anni 90 alternando il percorso professionale a quello familiare. Ho poi migliorato la mia tecnica seguendo un corso modellismo presso l’Accademia della Moda di Napoli. Tante le esperienze creative che si sono poi sintetizzate grazie al percorso professionale e manageriale che mi ha visto impegnata lo scorso anno nell’incubatore Vivaio Donna, dove mi sono confrontata con manager, artigiani e creative.

The journey started when two watch enthusiasts met to make an authentic design Swiss automatic watch which doesn’t cost an arm and leg and delivers everyday pleasure to wear. AS SEEN IN...  Our goal is to bring something new and different to our consumers. To create a design we wanted, we had to find our own unique brand concept which will live in our watches. After many exchanges of ideas, we took ‘moments of life’ idea to build our brand since we believe that our watches can have bigger meaning to our consumers than being just nice watches to wear.The idea is simple but relevant. In life, there are important moments which make difference. However, sometimes we miss them without realizing how important they are. We wish our consumers to be able to leverage full potential of each moment to live a successful and meaningful life without leaving important things behind.To translate this idea into more tangible design code, we chose camera as a medium because we saw a strong link between photography which captures slice of life and our idea about moments. Thanks to top Swiss watch designers that we work together, this concept is now materialized into a unique TATE WADE design.The design is elegant, premium, and playful. Each model boast its own personality to accommodate different preference that you may have. On the case back of each watch, it is written in Latin ‘Carpe Momentum in Vita” as per our brand mission. ‘Seize the moments in the life’.    BOKEH COLLECTIONBokeh collection offers you three styles of watches.  Bokeh Collection - Stainless Steel - 42mm Bokeh Collection Black PVD - 42mm Bokeh Collection Gun Metal PVD - 42mm  We chose SWISS MADE as we value the heritage of Swiss automatic watch industry which have been built over hundreds years through continuous innovation. If we were to make a quartz watch, we could have gone somewhere else to make our watches. However, for AUTOMATIC watches of long term value, we believe that Swiss Made is the right choice for you. It was also a challenge that we set for ourselves to prove that it is possible to create a unique Swiss Made watch with attractive price. Made by Swiss Craftmanships You might ask why we chose automatic watch rather than quartz which is more accurate. As watch enthusiasts, we believe that true value of a watch is not only in accurately measuring time but also in special emotional bonding that we can build with the watch for long period of time. We want a watch which we can proudly wear for long time and give it to someone important as a meaningful gift in life. When we finalized our brand concept, it became clear that it had to be a mechanical movement.Bokeh Collection - Black PVD - 42mm - Caseback ETA movement is one of the most popular movements used by the most of luxury Swiss watch brands.

</div></div>","If you wish to get your WT2 Plus, feel free to visit our Timekettle official website for purchase. Language is beautiful, fascinating and occasionally frustrating – especially if the conversation is between speakers of two different languages! When you're traveling abroad, there’s nothing worse than being stuck in an unknown place without a means to effectively communicate.Real communication is natural and face-to-face. Without eye contact and body language, conversations are awkward or altogether impossible.That's why we created the WT2 translator, the real-time translating earphone for natural, hands-free communication. Conversations between different languages are enabled by two earphone translators and one app. Each person wears one earphone - you speak in your language, they hear in theirs.WT2 was recently featured on TechCrunch. Thanks for the demo!We can't wait to share the WT2 translator with the Indiegogo community. With your help, we can bridge the gap in foreign language communication. WT2 is a real-time, wearable translator that includes 2 earphones, 1 app, and a customized charging case. The earphones provide long-term, hands-free foreign language communication, allowing you to immerse yourself in the local culture while traveling, express yourself more completely and build more meaningful connections with the people you meet.What is 1+2, and why is it the best solution for natural bilingual conversation?""1+2""=1 app + 2 earphone translators.Our WT2 is the world’s first and only “1+2 translation” system. This means that unlike other solutions, our patented technology innovatively allows multiplexed speech communication between both WT2 earphone translators and a single phone with the WT2 App, creating a smooth communication experience for the user.This system integrates wireless communication technology, intelligent algorithms, voice translation, and many other technologies into one seamless package. By using ""1 +2"", one can easily talk with anyone, regardless of spoken language, and with no awkward setup steps.“1+2“ is the key to breaking down language barriers across the globe, letting you easily talk to new people without having to worry about asking them to download an app on their own phone first - Just pass them an earphone and start having a real conversation! With the WT2, full eye contact and natural body language are maintained, allowing you to not only to talk to other people in different languages, but to really understand them. Here are some of WT2’s unique features:Perfect for travel enthusiasts, expats, homestay students, cross-cultural families, international shops, hotels and everyone in between. WT2 can help make your travel experience more enjoyable and improve your communication efficiency with foreign customers or partners.     WT2 comes ready to use - just separate the charging case and share one half with your speaking partner. The earphones will automatically wake up and pair with each other as well as the app. Nothing could be more Simple! The WT2 translator currently supports six languages: Mandarin Chinese, English, French, German, Japanese and Spanish. After our initial release, we will continually add more languages (Portuguese, Arabic, Thai, etc.), which will be rolled out via our app updates. Kickstarter Community: Please leave your ideas about which languages you would like WT2 to support! We’ll plan to include the most requested languages in our next app update.   After in-depth research that examined the most common travel situations and careful consideration of WT2’s technical capabilities, we’ve created three communication modes (“Auto”, “Manual”, and “Ask”) to deal with a variety of communication environments. This mode is for conversation in a relatively quiet environment such as a hotel, meeting room or coffee shop. There’s no need for any manual operation – with its advanced built-in in intelligent algorithm, WT2 will translate your conversation in real time, absolutely hands-free.  This mode makes communication possible even in a noisy environment. Unfortunately, the WT2 translator can’t be fully automatic in very noisy environments, but you can easily adapt to your surroundings by activating the Manual mode.  This mode is useful for quick inquiries like asking for directions or confirming a price.To use Ask mode, wear one of the earphones and hold your phone in front of your conversation partner. He or she can then hear the translation aloud or view the translated text.  The simple, creative design of our custom charging case makes it easy to share your WT2 translator with your speaking partner. There’s no awkward fumbling - just separate the charging case and start your conversation in one smooth step.  WT2’s charging case can recharge the earphones on-the-go for extended use and longer conversations. Just place your earphones inside the case and charging will start automatically. The battery life of the WT2 translator is approximately 2 hours when used outside of the charging case.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Doug Long. I served as a Peace Corp Volunteer in Swaziland from 93 to 95 and in Lesotho from 2003 to 2005. I addition to teaching computers and woodworking in the mountainous Thaba Tseka District, I also was a member of the District AIDS Task Force. The coordinating committee for volunteer efforts to combat the AIDS epidemic.</p>
<p>I have continued to fully support a couple of orphans (both of which lost their parents to AIDS) since returning to Hawaii in 2005 and return to Lesotho at least every 2 years to check their living, schooling and housing conditions.</p>
<p>When going back to Lesotho I go with as many suitcases as the airline will allow me, packed with cloths for a few of the many orphans in the country. Because of the weight and bulk of shoes, I generally collect what money I can to purchase shoes in South Africa and Lesotho. These school shoes are also distributed to the orphans.</p>
<p>Lesotho is not you typical picture of Africa. Just this winter 2 times they recieved over 18"" of snow. The winter months are from about April to September. Without shoes, because of the low tempuratures, it is impossbile for kids to attend school.</p>

<h2><strong><strong>Why we need your help right now</strong></strong></h2>
<p>By pledging we will be able to produce blank sweatshirts and hoodies which we will ship to our location here in the SF Bay Area using local vendors to do all the printings and embroidery. Our long term goal is to assemble our own printing and embroidery factory here in Oakland. The first step to our plan is to test this concept by making small quantity of blank apparels. </p>
<p></p>

<h2>The short of my story:</h2>
<p>My name is Baba Afolabi. I am a Bay Area resident living in Oakland. I have a passion for multiculturalism and diversity. I believe by wearing a diverse lifestyle brand, it will enhance our cultural awareness which in turn allows people to embrace diversity. </p>
<h3>The Logos</h3>

<p>After spending some time in Tokyo, Japan in 2008, I (Baba Afolabi-Founder) introduced the SuRu brand in November 2009 by releasing a few t-shirt designs and cab driver hats. From then on, we worked hard at SuRu on product quality, as it is our top priority to present you with an impeccable, comfortable product that will last. In 2010, I had a serious futbol (Soccer) injury that was so severe I was out of work for 8 months, living on temporary disability. I have to say it drove me nuts but yet fueled my passion to work even harder on SuRu. Through perseverance, I put my MBA to work by completing a 35 page business plan (excluding the financials). I called it<em> The SuRu Blueprint</em>. I diced it down to 28 pages (including financials) and I called it <em>The Business Plan</em>, then down to 8 pages and I called it <em>The Proposal</em>. I took the proposal to nearly all my friends with the hope of getting one of them to invest so I could revitalize the brand. I ended with two amazing friends that enabled us to produce our first top collection last year and acquire a pop-up shop (temporary store) to sell them. We are here on Indiegogo to raise funds. In order to make SuRu a successful brand and company, we need the support of the people and money to do many things, from production to marketing, from talent acquisition to giving back to the community, and more importantly bringing part of our production process to the USA.</p>

<p>Our goal is to provide internships and employment to local inner-city youth and college students interested in the apparel industry or simply looking for entry-level jobs. We would like to give them the opportunity and platform to do something fun and develop careers for themselves. In order to do this, we need your support to make this happen.</p>
<p>As a start-up apparel company, we are confined to buy from popular brands like American Apparel to place our graphics on their product to sell.

By pledging we will be able to produce blank sweatshirts and hoodies which we will ship to our location here in the SF Bay Area using local vendors to do all the printings and embroidery. Our long term goal is to assemble our own printing and embroidery factory here in Oakland. The first step to our plan is to test this concept by making small quantity of blank apparels. 


The short of my story:
My name is Baba Afolabi. I am a Bay Area resident living in Oakland. I have a passion for multiculturalism and diversity. I believe by wearing a diverse lifestyle brand, it will enhance our cultural awareness which in turn allows people to embrace diversity. 
The Logos

After spending some time in Tokyo, Japan in 2008, I (Baba Afolabi-Founder) introduced the SuRu brand in November 2009 by releasing a few t-shirt designs and cab driver hats. From then on, we worked hard at SuRu on product quality, as it is our top priority to present you with an impeccable, comfortable product that will last. In 2010, I had a serious futbol (Soccer) injury that was so severe I was out of work for 8 months, living on temporary disability. I have to say it drove me nuts but yet fueled my passion to work even harder on SuRu. Through perseverance, I put my MBA to work by completing a 35 page business plan (excluding the financials). I called it The SuRu Blueprint. I diced it down to 28 pages (including financials) and I called it The Business Plan, then down to 8 pages and I called it The Proposal. I took the proposal to nearly all my friends with the hope of getting one of them to invest so I could revitalize the brand. I ended with two amazing friends that enabled us to produce our first top collection last year and acquire a pop-up shop (temporary store) to sell them. We are here on Indiegogo to raise funds. In order to make SuRu a successful brand and company, we need the support of the people and money to do many things, from production to marketing, from talent acquisition to giving back to the community, and more importantly bringing part of our production process to the USA.



Our goal is to provide internships and employment to local inner-city youth and college students interested in the apparel industry or simply looking for entry-level jobs. We would like to give them the opportunity and platform to do something fun and develop careers for themselves. In order to do this, we need your support to make this happen.
As a start-up apparel company, we are confined to buy from popular brands like American Apparel to place our graphics on their product to sell. We are changing all that, but we need your support to make this happen. By pledging today you will be giving us the resources to achieve our objectives. We want to keep producing apparel that supports and promotes a diversity lifestyle. Our idea is to produce blank apparels using our own fabric choice and sewing details in factories and ship them to our location here in the San Francisco Bay Area, where we will do all the printing and embroidery work through local vendors. If this strategy thrives, we will invest our profits in assembling our own printing and embroidery machines. This will enable us to hire locally.

<p> </p>
<h3>About The Campaign:</h3> <p>We’ve heard it from you online and in our change rooms over the last five years - many of you are frustrated with the women’s clothing industry. These large corporations and major brands seem unable to make sizing and fit requests, and as a result, end up excluding the women they’re supposed to exist for. Imagine actually having a say and a vote about what clothing is being produced and put to market for women. Well, now you do!</p>
<p>Just like our swimwear line, we're now offering an opportunity for women to have a say in what items we make.</p> <h3>What is Kind Clothing?</h3>
<p>We're launching a brand new line of <strong>kind clothing</strong>. Why is it kind? It's kind to the women that wear it:</p>
<ul>
<li>In how it’s been <strong>designed to fit</strong>
</li>
<li>The wide <strong>range of sizes</strong> available (Don't see your size? Let us know!)</li>
<li>The <strong>quality of fabrics</strong> used</li>
</ul>
<p>It's also kind to the people that make it:</p>
<p>Every item is <strong>manufactured right here in Canada</strong>, in manufacturing shops we have good relationships with and visit on a regular basis. We know our shop owners and sewers.</p>
<p>We strive to use technically advanced fabric, that embrace new methods of creating more <strong>eco-friendly and sustainable</strong> garments for the planet, sewers and customers.</p>
<p>Our pieces are not only determined by our customers, they're also modelled by them. On our campaign and online shop, you’ll see women that look just like you and the women that surround you daily. The positive impact this has for the current and future generations is invaluable.</p>
<p><u>What We Need &amp; What You Get</u></p>
<p><strong>What we need:</strong></p>
<p>We want to make clothing you <strong>want,</strong> in the sizes that you <strong>need</strong>. We're using this as a pre-order campaign, so we’ll only produce items in the colours and sizes that our customers want and need. This keeps you, us and the planet happy!</p> <p><strong>What you get</strong>:</p>
<p>Clothing that’s made for you! This is an exclusive opportunity to order these  items at prices and in bundles that will never be offered again once the line goes to market.</p> <p>Here’s <strong>how it works</strong> (it’s easy, we promise!):</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">1. Choose Your <strong>Colour</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">2. Choose Your <strong>Size</strong> (Don't see your size? Email us)</p>

<p>Your new favourite everyday T-shirt has arrived. The perfect length for a french tuck (@Tanfrance), but no worries, it’s not a crop. This shirt is boxy, without looking like a box. Made from the softest blend of Rayon from Bamboo, Cotton and Spandex, this shirt washes nicely and maintains its shape no matter how well loved it becomes. My new favourite T-shirt to pair with my higher waisted, raw denim.</p>

<p>Your new favourite weekend warrior. The perfect length to wear with jeans or tights. Short enough to be a T-shirt, but long enough to cover that tush. Made from the softest blend of Rayon from Bamboo, Cotton and Spandex, this shirt washes nicely and maintains its shape no matter how well loved it becomes. Wear it as-is, or if you love the fit as much as I do, wear it tucked all the way in. Also a great length for days when you feel like knotting it.</p>

<h3>About Us</h3>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
</div><div><p>Some of the challenges we face manufacturing locally is slightly higher unit costs and sometimes longer production time lines. We're overcoming some of these challenges by making sure we are not producing wasteful units or amounts of inventory through pre-order campaigns like this one. </p></div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some of you won't be able to contribute to this campaign at this time, but still have a strong desire to see more size inclusive and ethical clothing going to market for women, that doesn't mean you can't contribute in your own way:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can get the word out about the line and make some noise about our pre-order campaign to friends, colleagues and family.</li>
<li>Or you can use any of the share tools, to share this campaign on any social media channels or by direct message and email (social share links at top of this page, by the video). </li>

We're launching a brand new line of kind clothing. Why is it kind? It's kind to the women that wear it:

In how it’s been designed to fit

The wide range of sizes available (Don't see your size? Let us know!)
The quality of fabrics used

It's also kind to the people that make it:
Every item is manufactured right here in Canada, in manufacturing shops we have good relationships with and visit on a regular basis. We know our shop owners and sewers.
We strive to use technically advanced fabric, that embrace new methods of creating more eco-friendly and sustainable garments for the planet, sewers and customers.
Our pieces are not only determined by our customers, they're also modelled by them. On our campaign and online shop, you’ll see women that look just like you and the women that surround you daily. The positive impact this has for the current and future generations is invaluable.
What We Need & What You Get
What we need:
We want to make clothing you want, in the sizes that you need. We're using this as a pre-order campaign, so we’ll only produce items in the colours and sizes that our customers want and need. This keeps you, us and the planet happy! What you get:
Clothing that’s made for you! This is an exclusive opportunity to order these  items at prices and in bundles that will never be offered again once the line goes to market. Here’s how it works (it’s easy, we promise!):
1. Choose Your Colour
2. Choose Your Size (Don't see your size? Email us)
3. Place Your Pre-Order

Wear it as-is, or if you love the fit as much as I do, wear it tucked all the way in. Also a great length for days when you feel like knotting it.

About Us
Hi there! We're Nettle's Tale and we launched our company in 2014 with an IndieGoGo campaign you can view it HERE. We've been making honest swimwear, sized after and modelled by women just like you, since the above campaign in 2014 and now, five years later we're still the same brand, with the same values, but we're launching something new and we've returned to our IndieGoGo family and our first ever customers to share it.
Risks & Challenges
Some of the challenges we face manufacturing locally is slightly higher unit costs and sometimes longer production time lines. We're overcoming some of these challenges by making sure we are not producing wasteful units or amounts of inventory through pre-order campaigns like this one. 
Other Ways You Can Help
Some of you won't be able to contribute to this campaign at this time, but still have a strong desire to see more size inclusive and ethical clothing going to market for women, that doesn't mean you can't contribute in your own way:

You can get the word out about the line and make some noise about our pre-order campaign to friends, colleagues and family.
Or you can use any of the share tools, to share this campaign on any social media channels or by direct message and email (social share links at top of this page, by the video).",10.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>I've been producing latex for a while and studied lingerie design at uni which has enabled me to create supportive lingerie for women of various sizes, including underwired bras from 30AA to 38F! This is alongside other clothing such as dresses and catsuits in price ranges to suit everyone’s budget.</p>
<p>Please look through the video above and my facebook images to see the variety of clothing I can do: <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/kittycreme"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.facebook.com/kittycreme</a> </p>
<p>I've had help from models and photographers to help me get to where I am today with local fashion shows and a lot of photo shoots, but I am eager to push this further - it's just the money side of things that's holding me back. With the donations it will allow me to explore the creative side of fashion within latex and diversify myself from other latex designers by producing more prints and laser cutting techniques for both men and women to enjoy. I want to push latex designing further and be able to be inspired by new shapes, prints and textures from the catwalks - as the high street does - and then push my work into the laps of other clothing companies for more sales.</p>
<p>I am just starting to explore menswear design within latex and want to create smart, sexy pieces that make men feel handsome and dominant and make women smile when they see them walk by!</p>
<p>I also want to be able to create a small bridal wear collection using cream latex that makes alternative style women think about the possibilities of their big day!</p>
<p>Here are some costings for this fund:</p>
<p>Latex: approx £600</p>
<p>Screen printing: approx £250</p>
<p>Laser cutting: approx £100</p>
<p>Photoshoot: approx £200</p>
<p>Model/fitting fees: approx £100</p>
<p>There are other costs too such as travel, cutting equipment, latex cleaner and glue, marketing, paying someone when I need an extra pair of hands etc but those above are what really need to be conquered first.</p>
<p>I like to push myself and be self reliant but unfortunately due to my disability I'm unable to work a full time job. I have a few orders coming in and I also hire out my samples so it helps to fund small projects, but this one I want to really use to push harder into the latex fashion scene and fetish/alternative markets. I aim to take my new collection as a catwalk to large fetish/alternative clubs and other places to promote my small but growing business as well as approach clothing shops with my smaller commercial pieces such as pencil skirts, stockings and lingerie.</p>
<p>I have thoroughly enjoyed being able to meet people through my work from various walks of life and I really enjoy this side of the work too. I just need to put in a lot of time, effort and money to take it to the next level of building my business.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you can't contribute then please would you be able to just share my campaign on your blog, social networking and modelling/photography sites. I would appreciate this a lot!</p></div>","My name is Catriona Stewart and I have been designing under the name Kitty Crème for the past year or two (it's all gradually changing to Catriona Stewart)

No compromise!  All of our handmade products undergo a steady process of creation and manifestation under the watch of our experienced artisans.  We believe our shoes are heirlooms for the modern man to savour, as he embarks on the journey of life and accumulates experiences with every step taken.   

  Each step in the process of making a Varvega shoe is done by hand. We take pride in paying extra attention to its details, from the welting to the stitching. It's a traditional way that we highly invest in, only because it adds to the character and longevity of our products.Our boots are made using materials of the best quality, one of which is our signature Horween Chromexcel leather, which, to exist, goes through a meticulous vegetable tanning process in Chicago, USA. We love this leather because it is is strong enough to maintain a solid form, yet fluid enough to give comfort to the wearer. Using it means that our shoes require little breaking in. (Want to know more about Horween?) Auburn  leather craftsmen have cultivated the passion, knowledge, and skills required to produce the finest quality American leather. Using only U.S. domestic dairy cowhides, Auburn deliver optimum strength, colorfast and crocking resistance while maintaining mellow temper (feel) and for our leather laces, optimum “tie-ability.” (Want to know more about Auburn Leather?) Our use of Italian vegetable tanned leather surrounds the foundation of our boots: the midsole. The leather is very durable and able to withstand harsh conditions, terrains, and surfaces. Our utility of it represents our belief in durability.Pictured above: our vegetable tan insole incorporating a cushion foam bed for extra comfort.Varvega boots are distinguishable through their brass accents. We believe their rustic quality adds depth to each design. Another unique selling point: each synthetic rubber outsole and heel beneath a Varvega shoe is customised to exert the best grip onto the ground. Goodyear Welt is an old-school blueprint for constructing durable and comfortable boots. At Varvega, this particular welt is styled in 270 degrees, with the Stormwelt detailing sealed together. This construction which is also known as Handwelt Constructio is incredibly easy to resole and water-resistantAnother blueprint that we abide by is the Double Stitchdown, also known as the Double Rows. It involves 270 degree parallel stitching that present the rugged looks of the boots. This construction give the best aesthetic value for the boots and it is also resole-able.Each of our four designs have its own distinguished profile via its last.V1910 D-Last for WoodsmanWide forepart.

<p>Corner Bag is the first travel ready punching bag. It uses the inner or outer corner of walls for support. It is lightweight, sets-up or stows away in seconds, and it won’t disturb your neighbors.</p>
<p>If you are familiar with punching bags there are no products on the market that are user friendly in places like apartments, condominiums or small homes. The Corner Bag was specifically engineered to fill that void. Corner Bag makes it possible to exercise using a punching bag that can handle more than you can dish out without disturbing the person in the room next to you. Once you have finished exercising you can leave it up or stow it in less than a minute. We have created a full contact, truly portable and user friendly punching bag which will offer more versatility, quality and features but at the same price of its competition.</p>

<p><u>What is a Corner Bag</u>? </p>
<p>Answer: A Corner Bag is a truly portable punching bag.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><u>Why would anybody want a Corner Bag</u>?</p>
<p>Answer: For years the trend in exercise equipment has been towards providing a product that is portable and compact for home use, contact sport equipment included. The Corner Bag has a space saving design that allows it to use both the inner or outer corner within a room for support. This product also has the ability to be disassembled within seconds without the use of tools so that it can then be placed within its own duffle bag for easy transport in the trunk of any compact car or to be placed in any conventional closet for out of the way storage.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><u>Will this product disturb others and damage my walls</u>?</p>
<p>Answer: No the product will not disturb others because it is engineered to collapse in upon itself which cushions the users punch absorbing the energy within the Corner Bag and with minimal energy transfer reaching the wall. The energy transfer would best be described as the impact effect created if someone were to hit a wall with a semi firm sofa cushion. Due to the cushioning attribute of the Corner Bag it can be used rigorously without causing structural or aesthetic damage to one’s home, office or etc. </p>
<p><u></u> </p>
<p><u>What if I have some questions / feedback for you</u>?</p>
<p>Answer: Great! Feel free to drop us an email at <a href=""mailto:Indiegogo@cornerbag.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Indiegogo@cornerbag.com</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p><u>Any risks along the road</u>?</p>
<p>Answer: Hardware projects need careful planning for getting the supply chain and manufacturing process right. In fact, that's almost as much work as developing the actual features of a device. </p>

Our objective is to engineer the improvements from our previous two prototypes into a final market ready model, after which we will tour the nation filming the reaction of people testing out the Corner Bag. The results will be posted on Youtube. Interest and support will confirm the consumer base needed to help bring the Corner Bag to the market place. 
The market ready prototype will allow Corner Bag to acquire the funding needed to make it a reality.
 




 

*Marketing tour will consist of a National Corner Bag challenge of people putting the product to the test with the video results posted on Youtube. 
 

Corner Bag is the first travel ready punching bag. It uses the inner or outer corner of walls for support. It is lightweight, sets-up or stows away in seconds, and it won’t disturb your neighbors.
If you are familiar with punching bags there are no products on the market that are user friendly in places like apartments, condominiums or small homes. The Corner Bag was specifically engineered to fill that void. Corner Bag makes it possible to exercise using a punching bag that can handle more than you can dish out without disturbing the person in the room next to you. Once you have finished exercising you can leave it up or stow it in less than a minute. We have created a full contact, truly portable and user friendly punching bag which will offer more versatility, quality and features but at the same price of its competition.
Are you:


A parent with a child engaged in self-defense classes?
Unable to use a punching bag because you have limited space?
A personal trainer that could use a travel punching bag with your clients?
A professional athlete that would like to train on the go?
Unable to use a punching bag because you live in a condo or apartment?
Then you'll be interested in what the Corner Bag can do! 
 

Light weight & portable (35 – 40 lbs)
No attachments to structure
Reduces joint stress
No gloves or wraps needed
Quiet – won’t disturb the neighbors
 
Prototype #1

  
Prototype #2 


  

 

 

 

  
  

  

  
  

The Corner Bag evolves the home use punching bag and the commercial gym punching bags into an exercise tool that makes use of the smallest of dwellings. It includes features that make a professional but lightweight portable tool making punching bags available to everyone. If your home, office or place of travel has an inner or outer corner there is a place for the Corner Bag.

 

Corner Bag future projects include: 

 Speed bag attachment
 Multiple form configurations for specialty practices
 Corner Bag for kids
Interactive training applications
A few first to the market services and modifications that need to be kept under wraps
 


Where are we now?
In the last 12 months, we completed our second prototype. We have a semi-production-quality prototype with all the functions tested and verified. We are very excited about the results!
What do we need the funds for? Bringing a streamline product to the market involves a huge initial investment. We have been financing the development ourselves until now, but we need support for:

Manufacturing Engineer design time 
Computer simulated design testing
Market quality prototype

Planning




July - Aug       


Integrate improvements into designComputer simulated test of new designFinalize design




Sep - Oct 


Contract prototype fabrication Test finished productCreate product demo video 








November


National Marketing tour

It seemed  as though all the designers had gone out to lunch one day and all agreed to  make the same old clothing that looked the same if it was worn by a 19 or a 90  year old. </p>
<p>Many  years ago when I started this concept, I wanted a clothing line that was epic,  clever in its concept, easily recognisable, and borderline or something that  would push the boundaries but not be overtly offensive and most importantly a  youth brand!</p>
<p>After going  through what seemed like a forest of sketch paper and a mountain of setbacks, I  had to thank Mother Nature for the design inspiration as she did it first and  JIZZ was born!</p>

At the end of  each calendar year we will donate a portion of profits to four (4) animal charities.</p>
<p>We will  change to another four animal charities at the end of each and every year to  try and help out as many good causes as we can.</p>
<p>In  keeping with our local philosophy, we will try and donate to some localised,  volunteer run animal charities/rescue organisations and some larger global organisations.</p>
<p>As an  example, at the end of our first year of trading I would love to donate to the  following four unbelievably great causes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><a href=""http://www.hopeforpaws.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.Hopeforpaws.org</a></em><br/><span style=""font-size: smaller;"">Dog rescues watch and try not to cry</span></p>

</blockquote>
<p>I am  really excited about this! I can hardly wait for that moment in time (with your  help by the end of 2015?) when we proudly announce our donations to the above  worthy causes via blog, web site, twitter, press release etc. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/762313/files/20140802220126-Right_Sperm.PNG?1407042086"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

It will fulfil a lifelong ambition, it will allow  us to complete our range and order products in greater numbers thus reducing  costs and production timelines. </p>
<p>It will  allow us to create a marketing campaign that can, at the moment, only be dreamed  off. It will allow us to reach a critical mass in the shortest possible time  and therefore also allow us to reach our goals of donations to worthy causes.</p>
<p>I am acutely  aware and grateful for your pledges and all funds will be dispersed in a timely  and responsible manner. </p>
<p>Don't  forget, if we meet our funding goal all of your forever discounts are turbo  charged to the next level.</p>
<br/><p style=""color: #0292CC; font-weight: bold;"">Q. What happens if we can only get to say AUD 30K?</p>
<p>Good  question. Whatever amount we eventually end up raising we can fulfil our perks  and obligations. I have assembled a range of manufacturers both large and small  and whether it's a production run of 50 or 5000 pieces or more we can do it.</p>
<p>Not  meeting our funding goal makes the process slower (The process of being a  global brand) and limits our immediate product range but don't worry, T shirts,  Caps, Sunnies, Underwear and personalised Underwear as per the perks can and  will be fulfilled as these are our minimum product range.</p>
<p>Roughly  speaking 65K would be divided into the following, 50K design and manufacture, 15K marketing. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/762313/files/20140802220126-Right_Sperm.PNG?1407042086"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

</div></div>","is an epic clothing brand ready to explode and definitely not for the faint hearted!
JIZZ will get you noticed!
JIZZ may even get you in trouble...
By pledging your support you get a generous range of insane lifetime perks and on top of that, you can also be regularly involved in the future development of this soon to be, customer driven global brand.
Our intro video (above) is where we see our impact, our power, our direction.
Do you fit the JIZZ lifestyle? 

 I have always  been frustrated in bland and look - all - the - same clothing lines. It seemed  as though all the designers had gone out to lunch one day and all agreed to  make the same old clothing that looked the same if it was worn by a 19 or a 90  year old. 
Many  years ago when I started this concept, I wanted a clothing line that was epic,  clever in its concept, easily recognisable, and borderline or something that  would push the boundaries but not be overtly offensive and most importantly a  youth brand!
After going  through what seemed like a forest of sketch paper and a mountain of setbacks, I  had to thank Mother Nature for the design inspiration as she did it first and  JIZZ was born!

Since  then there has been battle after battle, setbacks and frustrations, but I kept  true to the cause and never gave up on bringing the JIZZ brand to life. Please  check out my campaign video above. 

 You name it, JIZZ got it. Starting with the initial product line up and soon to have a full range of on line clothing and accessories.
Our reach will be global, our focus local.
Unlike other companies we will not hide behind community forums and faq's, we will always be approachable and available. Even via direct, regular contact with Banga via the founder's portal.
Tell us what you (our most important person) think. You can even submit your design ideas and if we include your designs in our product line, you will receive regular royalty payments for as long as your design is sold by us.
In addition to large production runs we can also CUSTOM DESIGN your JIZZ wear!
Unique designs and a capacity to do very small runs  allow us to create genuine limited editions.
Give us your design or direction you are after or leave it to us to design you something unique! 


  We appreciate your pledge and we want to grow with you. In recognition of this we  have made our perks generous and lifelong.
From our  lowest to our highest perks, all have some form of lifelong benefit to you  ranging all the way up to 50% off for life!

 The  Founders Portal is where you go one on one with Banga, the founder of the founder of JIZZ wear, via webinar and Skype. Giveaways and prizes are offered at our webinars for best/most creative JIZZ ideas!
Unlike other clothing brands, we  want to hear from you on a regular basis. Scope ideas and designs, give us  feedback and most of all, stay in touch! 

Q. How will I organise my perks and personalised underwear?
  At the end of the capital raising  period we will contact you and you scan/email us your signature or initials  that you want sewn onto your one pair of personalised JIZZ underwear. You also  select the size/s, male or female, colours and design of your other JIZZ  products at this time. 

Q. When will my Perks be delivered?
 As you  may appreciate, individual, custom design products will take some time to  organise. Product delivery is anticipated in late October or early November  2014. We will always try and get you your perks on an ASAP basis.
T-shirts  and/or underwear and other JIZZ products can be either male or female or a  combination of both.
Postage/delivery  is included for all perks. Delivery address will of course be required.
The  Ultimate Oahu, Hawaii package will be in delivered approximately late 2015 or  early 2016.
Passports  required for non-USA residents. Perk includes economy return flight for two  from the Americas, the European Union, or Asia/Pacific region. Also included  will be accommodation at a four star resort in Oahu, plus all activities and  meals. We will be combining new product launch with a mini doco we will be  making. You are invited to join in and be part of the fun...
BTW,  after you have pledged if you share our campaign with your friends we will give  you $5.00 refund for every referral. See below for further details.  


 When you  support JIZZ you'll be helping all kinds of animal charities. At the end of  each calendar year we will donate a portion of profits to four (4) animal charities.
We will  change to another four animal charities at the end of each and every year to  try and help out as many good causes as we can.
In  keeping with our local philosophy, we will try and donate to some localised,  volunteer run animal charities/rescue organisations and some larger global organisations.
As an  example, at the end of our first year of trading I would love to donate to the  following four unbelievably great causes:

www.Hopeforpaws.orgDog rescues watch and try not to cry
www.seashepherd.orgDo we need to say anything else
www.twinniespelicanandseabirdrescue.comUnbelievable what these guys do
www.animalsasia.orgIn total awe to what these guys have achieved

I am  really excited about this! I can hardly wait for that moment in time (with your  help by the end of 2015?) when we proudly announce our donations to the above  worthy causes via blog, web site, twitter, press release etc. 

 Our goal  is AUD 65K. What does 65K do? It will fulfil a lifelong ambition, it will allow  us to complete our range and order products in greater numbers thus reducing  costs and production timelines. 
It will  allow us to create a marketing campaign that can, at the moment, only be dreamed  off. It will allow us to reach a critical mass in the shortest possible time  and therefore also allow us to reach our goals of donations to worthy causes.
I am acutely  aware and grateful for your pledges and all funds will be dispersed in a timely  and responsible manner. 
Don't  forget, if we meet our funding goal all of your forever discounts are turbo  charged to the next level.
Q. What happens if we can only get to say AUD 30K?
Good  question. Whatever amount we eventually end up raising we can fulfil our perks  and obligations. I have assembled a range of manufacturers both large and small  and whether it's a production run of 50 or 5000 pieces or more we can do it.
Not  meeting our funding goal makes the process slower (The process of being a  global brand) and limits our immediate product range but don't worry, T shirts,  Caps, Sunnies, Underwear and personalised Underwear as per the perks can and  will be fulfilled as these are our minimum product range.
Roughly  speaking 65K would be divided into the following, 50K design and manufacture, 15K marketing. 


YOU! After  many years, most of the hard work has been done. But we now need your support  to take us from a brand that only does a few pair at a time to a brand that is  global and has a full product range.
If you  want to be part of the growth of JIZZ we invite you to pledge, join and enjoy a  lifetime of discounts and participate in the fruits of founders portal and have  real input into your brand.
If you  want to just pledge and enjoy a lifetime of discounts that's great too!

We can do this  alone...
    but it's more fun  with you!

How can I contribute to the campaign?
As we are raising money in Aussie  Dollars we can only accept Pay Pal via Indiegogo as per Indiegogo's rules.  Anyone can contribute, you just need to have a PayPal account to pay the perk.  If you do not have a PayPal account but have a credit card, you can use the ""Pay as guest"" feature in PayPal. For instructions on how to pay as a Guest on PayPal, please visit: https://www.paypal.com 
$10 REFUND FOR EVERY REFERRAL!
Share our campaign with your friends. If that  person pledges to our campaign through you, we will refund you $10.00
As an example
Pledge  any of the JIZZ perks and then refer as many people as you want by sharing your  pledge and your unique URL.
For each person that pledges through your share URL, we will credit you $10.00 Refer as many times and as many people as you like.
At the end of our campaign we will refund you based on the number of your referrals.
PLEASE Note: You have to share using your personal URL link otherwise we won't know who you have referred or if they have pledged.

<br/><h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Clothes play a huge part in our lives.

It is about shifting the focus from <b>PROFIT</b> to <b>VALUE</b> creation. Once this happens, more profit will be made, while more people will experience true joy in fashion and more people will be able to build their life towards abundance. <br/><br/></p>
<h2>Let's move towards a good fashion industry together.</h2>
</div></div>","I believe that if you want to do something GOOD in the world, for people and the environment, that fashion is the right path for doing so. 

This is why:


Seventy-five million people are working in this industry worldwide.
Everybody needs clothes to wear, whether for functional or decorational reasons.
Thirty percent of the clothes produced is a waste of resources.
The textiles industry is the second biggest water consumer worldwide.
Five percent of the total landfill consists out of textiles.
Millions of clothing manufacturers are working in inhumane conditions.
Millions of consumers are getting insecure about their bodies because clothes do not make them feel confident and protected.

... but most importantly because...
There is a way to shift fashion from a harming to a contributing industry. I promise.

Here's is presentation I gave at Tedx that explains exactly what good fashion is and how it can be achieved.


Why a video-course?
Because it gives you an easy access to the finding of my research and the tools of the design system, no matter where you are situated. 


No need for traveling 
No need for planning in a meeting or a seminar
No need for working closely with me for months 


The design system will help your brand to:


Build a community of customers
Test the designs twice to ensure success
Prevent waste of resources during the production
Prevent waste of financial investments
Make more profit
Create something GOOD in the world!


I will keep the research and developments going on my part, but to REALLY make a difference we need to work together to develop the system further based on practice.


The more people join the movement, the more we can achieve.


You can help to develop this project by contributing financially and joining the movement.


 The money is needed for the development and the filming of the video-course, which in turn will make the findings available to a much larger group of fashion creators. 

This Is What I Can Offer You

designed a unique t-shirt for each of the 50 United States using the State name and State outline/shape.  By selling these shirts we want to provide
for as many people who are in need of clothing as we can. For
every shirt you purchase we give one to someone in need in your state.At
the end of the campaign we are going to double the number of shirts we give to
those in need in the State with the most shirt sales.  So rather than a buy one give one they will
get a buy one give two. 
The number of people in need of clothing (especially during
cold winter months) in the United States is a lot greater than many suppose.  There are many homeless individuals on the
streets and families who have fallen on hard times or lost everything from
fires, floods and other disasters. 
School districts and teachers are consistently listing clothing items as
one of the top items in great need for their students.  

From keeping someone living on the street warm
to allowing someone who just lost everything they owned to not have to worry about
a need as basic as not having clothes to wear your help today will make a
difference in another’s life.

</div></div>","Preorder Now at Wiivv.com  This isn’t just an innovation in footwear. It’s a revolution in an industry plagued by mass-produced products, rigid offshore supply chains, and the inability to capitalize on the full potential of 3D printing. Instead, we are talking about one-off custom products at scale and manufactured locally. Unlike the big guys, stuck on aesthetics and expensive 3D prototypes, Wiivv is making every shoe custom fit to you from our factory in San Diego, California. It’s the biggest leap in footwear since foam!
 

 
Access our award-winning foot capture app on your iOS or Android smartphone to digitally map your feet for your Wiivv Custom Fit Sandals. 
Wiivvs are designed for your specific feet, giving you unparalleled comfort and improved biomechanics that no other sandal can provide. Of course, you can personalize them as well.
  

 

 

 
  

 
Of the 7 billion people on this planet, person to person, from left to right, your feet are unique. We believe your footwear should be too!
Wiivv Custom Fit Sandals are biomechanically designed to fit your unique feet—relieving joint discomfort, foot fatigue and even plantar fasciitis—so you can live and move comfortably.
 

  
    

 

 

 

  

Choose from four strap colors and multiple arch colors. Straps are interchangeable so you can switch them up!

 
 
 

 
   

 
Traditional flat flip flops are really bad for us. That’s no secret. So we said, f*ck that. Let’s design a sandal that not only looks good, it actually supports your body’s biomechanics throughout the day.

Traditional Flip Flops


Lack of arch support can cause issues in your feet, ankles, knees, hips and lower back.  
Toe thongs can hurt like hell and cause blisters. 
Poorly-fitting straps mean sliding feet, “toe scrunch” and soreness. 
Lack of cushioning means more impact on your body.

Wiivv Custom Fit Sandals

Custom fit 3D printed arches support your feet and lower body.  
Triple-density foam footbeds give all-day comfort. 
Deep, compressible heel cups absorb shock as you walk.
No-rub toe thongs with custom placement based on your foot width-- bye, bye blisters!
Custom-fit straps hold and support your feet with every step.

 
 

 

Customize and order your own Custom Fit Sandals with our proprietary foot-capture technology.
  

    

We digitally map over 200 data points on each foot. This data allows us to pinpoint your unique foot length, width and arch shape.

 

In less than 5 seconds this 2D data is accurately converted into 3D models of your unique arch supports, which are 3D printed at our facility in San Diego. Our adaptive manufacturing process allows us to use your foot measurement data to customize your unique toe thong and strap placements (both US patent pending) so you can experience true custom comfort.
Every pair of Wiivv Custom Fit Sandals is quality-checked and verified by biomechanical experts before being beautifully packaged and shipped right to your front door.
 
Switching Out Your Straps
It’s easy to switch out your straps to suit your style. They are also machine-washable.

 
   

  
Wiivv is driven by innovation and the feedback of our customers. Our products are the result of scientific research, multiple design iterations, data gathering and rigorous product testing. We work with leaders and experts to ensure our products are changing the footwear industry.
 

We leveraged our experience developing the groundbreaking Wiivv Custom Fit 3D Printed Insoles—including our proprietary customization technologies, biomechanics expertise, tens of thousands of foot scans, and relentless commitment to design perfection—to create a sandal that supports your biomechanics.
Wiivv’s Science Advisory Board is made up of the following independent experts who have validated our cutting-edge process and methodology.

 

 

 
We durability-tested Wiivv Custom Fit Sandals at the Lululemon White Space Innovation Lab and the Fortius Sport and Health Center in Vancouver, Canada. The sandals were tested at temperatures as high as 50 degrees Celsius and as low as -10 degrees Celsius to ensure they can meet your needs.
After two years of throwing everything you can at them, your Wiivv Custom Fit Sandals will still be the most comfortable sandals you have ever worn.
 
 
 

 

 
Wiivv footbeds are 100% closed-loop recyclable. Return your sandals to us at the end of their lives. The material will be used to make new sandals, eliminating waste and reducing emissions. Wiivvs are 3D printed and locally assembled at our facility in San Diego and sold directly to customers, reducing the environmental impact of shipping.
 
Rewards

 

  
Wiivv Wants To Create New Manufacturing Jobs In Your Country
Wiivv will open a 3D manufacturing facility in any eligible country that pledges 25,000 pairs of Wiivv Custom Fit Sandals. (Eligible countries are Australia, Canada, UK, Ireland and New Zealand) Since we already have a factory in the United States, we will need 50,000 pairs of Wiivv Custom Fit Sandals pledged from American backers in order to open a second manufacturing facility on home soil.
Sounds crazy, right? It actually fits perfectly with our commitment to local manufacturing, fast turnarounds and keeping shipping costs low. Help accelerate our vision of locally-made Wiivvs by backing us today!
 

   
In order to make and ship the groundbreaking Wiivv Custom Fit Sandals, we need to produce the tooling to make them in a full range of foot sizes. We have already sourced the materials and defined the manufacturing process. This is the next step in our journey to make affordable, custom fit footwear a reality, made right here in the USA. We need your help—we can’t do it without you.

Wiivv got our start by crowdfunding last year——launching Wiivv Custom Fit 3D Printed Insoles with people like you who shared the vision.
You helped us break the record for the most crowdfunded 3D-printed product EVER.

 
We've proven that we can deliver on schedule. Our first Indiegogo campaign ended in March 2016 and we shipped all our orders by the end of August 2016. Since then we’ve fulfilled orders for over 10K pairs of Wiivv Custom Fit Insoles to six different countries and are now averaging a scan-to-door turnaround time of seven days. Our customer response has been AMAZING.

The Wiivv Custom Fit Sandal has gone through a year of R&D with over 50 product iterations during the process. It’s been rigorously tested. And to cover every base, we offer a 30 Day Happiness Guarantee or your money back.

 
 

 
 
Fulfillment will begin December 2017. Shipping rates are as follows:

<h3><span style=""font-size: medium;"">Hi, I'm Mia Morgan creator of The Fashion Alchemist.  I've been successful as a fashion stylist for over 15 years and have worked on hundreds of fashion shoots and styled a countless number of A-list celebrities. I can't name them all here but you can view my work at miamorgan.com</span></h3>
<p>The Fashion Alchemist is my first project designing and launching a collection of my own.  As a fashion insider I've been exposed to many of the best creations in the world and I appreciate timeless pieces with a personal signature.  With the Fashion Alchemist I will be working with indigenious cultures to bring their traditional crafts to the fashion world.  I'm starting by traveling to Peru this winter to develop my first line with the artisans from this region. This tribe creates patterns based on the the ancient healing songs of the Shaman.  I've personally received the most incredible healing of my life from them - as did all of us who were there - beyond anything we could have ever imagined.  People received deep and lasting healing on the physical, emotional and spiritual level. This is exactly what the world needs right now and exactly what I am excited to share.   Prior to now I've never been able to take time off away my busy styling schedule but I believe that the time is now for me to finally take a leap. With your support we can bring these fashions into the world and your contribution will make this a reality.</p>
<h3><span style=""font-size: medium;"">With $10,000 I will travel to Peru this winter and begin the development of the sample collection.  I will bring these back to New York this Spring.  $10,000 will allow me to get it started but with $50,000 I can really get things off the ground.  I'll be able to hire a small team to help me develop the collection further, ensure retail placement and create a fully functioning online boutique.</span></h3>
<p>All of these creations are hand-made and will have an energetic pattern attached to it.  You can think of this as a way to bring what you want into your life like healing, protection, love and prosperity.  Depending on your contribution, I will bring back a special item just for you.  Some of these items will include, scarves, coasters, pillow covers and accessories.  I've already booked my trip so your funding will go directly to the development of the line.  If I don't reach my entire goal I will still be able to get started on the development and bring back items for you as I am already on my way to Peru.</p>
<p><em>In addition</em> to providing an essential livelihood for women in their villages (through supporting their embroidery work), <strong><em>33% of the proceeds will go towards supporting the Alianza Arkana, a grassroots alliance which supports the people of the Amazon and it's traditions and 33% will go to the craftmakers themselve</em></strong>s.  Supporting the Amazon is essential to having a cleaner and healthier environment for the entire planet.  We don't have a lot of time to waste.</p>
<p>Even if you can't contribute financially, please help to spread the word by posting on your facebook page or twitter.  You can use the indigogo share tools to help me spread the word.  Every little bit counts to help bring The Fashion Alchemist to life.  Thank you for your time.</p>

<h1><em><strong>WHY WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT</strong></em></h1>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>We are still in the growing stages</strong> of our work and we want you to be a part of it!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Indigenous peoples working with us are looking for alternatives to extractive industries</strong>, as the world benefits best from the rainforest - the lungs and climate regulator of our planet - by leaving it standing and its cultures having the choice to remain as stewards of the forests.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>A viable venue for their work helps the artisans</strong> cultivate and pass down their artistry to the youth, which encourages them to stay in their communities.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>To supply artisans</strong> with laptops, internet service and printers, drilling tools, camera &amp; eyeglasses. The Awajún lost their communitations tower to heavy weather a few years ago and we plan to replace it, so they don't have to travel by boat or car for many hours to the nearest town for basic communication for their community needs and the needs of the artisans.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>To purchase larger amounts of production units</strong> from the current artisans we work with and the new communities waiting to work with us.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Trade shows are costly and we need to participate in important shows</strong> to place the artisans' work in the right stores.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>To optimize <a href=""http://orgbyvio.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ORGbyvio.com</a>'s online presence</strong> and ensure our <a href=""http://orgbyvio.com/shop"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">online store</a> sells directly to customers globally.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>To reach more people around the globe</strong> with beautiful eco fashion from the Amazon rainforest handmade by talented indigenous artisans and ensure a sustainable economy for the stewards of the forests.</li>
</ul>
<h1><em><strong><br/>HOW MUCH IS NEEDED?</strong></em></h1>
<p>We have set our goal to <strong>$20,000</strong> for this phase of our work outlined above. However, the total amount needed to accomplish our ongoing work is upward of <strong>$100,000</strong>. Your contribution will help achieve this larger goal.<br/><br/><em>When you contribute, <strong>note </strong>that part of it<strong> will be used to pay for and ship your selected reward</strong>. Also, <strong>Indiegogo gets 4% <em><strong>of total money raised</strong></em>, if we reach our goal and 9% if we don't, and a p</strong><strong>ayment processing fee <em><strong>of 2-3%</strong></em> will be charged.</strong></em></p>
<h1><strong><em><br/>WHAT YOU GET FOR YOUR SUPPORT</em></strong></h1>
<p>Aside from playing a big part in our project, you pick up beautiful rewards, if you select that option when you contribute. There are a number of levels of support. Any amount contributed is helpful in meeting our goal. We are grateful for all your love and support!</p>

Deep in Forests is a partnership of indigenous leaders and entrepreneurs working together to create sustainable solutions for the protection of the rainforest and cultures that have been stewards of the Amazon for centuries. Deep in Forests connected me with other Amazon community members and thus I began working with <a href=""http://orgbyvio.com/awajun"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Awajún</a> artisans in the Peruvian rainforest in mid 2011. The Awajún Artisans' Women’s Association of the Nor-Orient Awajún Region (AMRNA) is made up of over 50 highly talented women artisans dedicated to their arts and culture.</p>

<p><strong><a href=""http://www.perunature.com/info.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rainforest Expeditions</a></strong> is a recipient of The Rainforest Alliance 2012 Sustainable Standard-Setter award. This Peruvian ecotourism company shares with visitors in a sustainable manner the miracles of the Tambopata-Candamo Reserved Zone, 1.5 million hectares of pristine, still wild, tropical rainforest encompassing an area of land the size of Connecticut and stretching from the Andean highlands to the Amazon lowlands. It includes the Tambopata National Reserve, a 275,000-hectare conservation unit created by the Peruvian government in 1990 to protect the watersheds of the Tambopata and Candamo rivers. It is adjacent to the 1-million-hectare Bahuaja Sonene National Park. Conservation and ecotourism is helping to protect some of the last untouched lowland and premontane tropical humid forests in the Amazon.</p>
<p>Since 1989, guests of first one and now three Rainforest Expedition eco-lodges have added value to the region’s standing tropical rainforest. A sensitively conceived and managed (in some cases by native communities) touristic infrastructure creates a competitive alternative to such unsustainable economic uses as clear cutting the forest for timber or for cattle grazing. The partnerships Rainforest Expeditions has forged with local people eager to share Amazonian traditions with guests provide connection, expertise, adventure and access to wildlife in the jungles of Tambopata. Rainforest Expeditions has been verified and certified “a sustainable tourism business” by the <a href=""http://www.rainforest-alliance.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rainforest Alliance</a>. <a href=""http://www.perunature.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.perunature.com</a><br/><br/></p>

Thanks again to all who contributed!

We work on creative design projects in collaboration with indigenous communities in the Amazon to promote their ancestral artistry, incorporating their traditional work into contemporary designs, as a means to generate a sustainable economy for the stewards of the most biodiverse ecosystem.
 
This is a great opportunity for you to support our work in the Amazon, pick up some beautiful rewards from the artisans we work with, and be a part of our project to protect the rainforest and the rich cultures and people that inhabit the Amazon through design!
 

WHY WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT


We are still in the growing stages of our work and we want you to be a part of it!



Indigenous peoples working with us are looking for alternatives to extractive industries, as the world benefits best from the rainforest - the lungs and climate regulator of our planet - by leaving it standing and its cultures having the choice to remain as stewards of the forests.



A viable venue for their work helps the artisans cultivate and pass down their artistry to the youth, which encourages them to stay in their communities.



To supply artisans with laptops, internet service and printers, drilling tools, camera & eyeglasses. The Awajún lost their communitations tower to heavy weather a few years ago and we plan to replace it, so they don't have to travel by boat or car for many hours to the nearest town for basic communication for their community needs and the needs of the artisans.



To purchase larger amounts of production units from the current artisans we work with and the new communities waiting to work with us.



Trade shows are costly and we need to participate in important shows to place the artisans' work in the right stores.



To optimize ORGbyvio.com's online presence and ensure our online store sells directly to customers globally.



To reach more people around the globe with beautiful eco fashion from the Amazon rainforest handmade by talented indigenous artisans and ensure a sustainable economy for the stewards of the forests.

HOW MUCH IS NEEDED?
We have set our goal to $20,000 for this phase of our work outlined above. However, the total amount needed to accomplish our ongoing work is upward of $100,000. Your contribution will help achieve this larger goal.When you contribute, note that part of it will be used to pay for and ship your selected reward. Also, Indiegogo gets 4% of total money raised, if we reach our goal and 9% if we don't, and a payment processing fee of 2-3% will be charged.
WHAT YOU GET FOR YOUR SUPPORT
Aside from playing a big part in our project, you pick up beautiful rewards, if you select that option when you contribute. There are a number of levels of support. Any amount contributed is helpful in meeting our goal. We are grateful for all your love and support!
All Rewards are listed on the right and photos are included below, so scroll down to see all your options! Everyone who contributes from $10 and up will be listed as a supporter and funder on our website, and you will be included in our supporters album with a photo you submit, unless you choose otherwise.

Asociación Sukû Artisans of Cofán Dureno, Ecuadorian Amazon.
In 2010, I began working with Cofán community artisans of Asociación Sukû in the Ecuadorian Amazon to share traditional Cofán artistry and culture and act as a bridge between the artisans, their artistry and markets. Asociacón Sukû is an organization made up of over 40 highly talented women artisans, whose mission is to contribute and improve social, economic and cultural development of their members and the community, strengthening their cultural and spiritual identity through projects in agriculture, forestry, arts and crafts, and protection of the rainforest. This initial work with Cofán artisans evolved into the brand ORG by vio®.

  ORG stands for Organic Rainforest Goods and spells GRO backwards; by vio is an acronym for Violeta and Indigenous Organizations.  ORG by vio® was created as an umbrella for promoting Amazon culture, protection of the rainforest and selling handmade jewelry and accessories made by indigenous Amazon artisans. We work in partnership with artisans in the Amazon to share their traditional artistry and develop designer collections of eco fashion made with rainforest materials as a source for a sustainable economy. It is an honor to work with such prolific artisans who are inspired to share their work and culture with the world.
Our work includes: trainings; purchasing artisans' traditional crafts and collections we co-develop together up front; buying materials and production tools for the artisans; supplying them with laptops and internet to communicate, so they can receive their product orders via email and place Skype calls, as well as to utilize these tools to share their culture and events directly via the internet; paying for artisans' expenses when attending exhibits and fairs; helping the artisans open bank accounts for their associations, which facilitate their financial transactions; et cetera. In addition ORG by vio® shares 50% of profits with artisans and/or their communities through projects that enhance their livelihood while maintaining their cultural identity. Visit orgbyvio.com/projects to learn more.Although, the preceding states what ORG by vio® does, NOTE further down what the funds will be used for in this particular phase of our work.

Deep in Forests network, Perú.
In 2011 I became a member of the Deep in Forests network in Perú. Deep in Forests is a partnership of indigenous leaders and entrepreneurs working together to create sustainable solutions for the protection of the rainforest and cultures that have been stewards of the Amazon for centuries. Deep in Forests connected me with other Amazon community members and thus I began working with Awajún artisans in the Peruvian rainforest in mid 2011. The Awajún Artisans' Women’s Association of the Nor-Orient Awajún Region (AMRNA) is made up of over 50 highly talented women artisans dedicated to their arts and culture.
Awajún Artisans' Women’s Association of the Nor-Orient Awajún Region (AMRNA) in Urakusa, Peruvian Amazon.
Most indigenous Amazon communities like the Awajún, although they are a contacted people, live in remote areas where they get no visitors and are unable to sell their beautiful work. ORG by vio® is committed to the artisans in bringing their work to the rest of the world.   Click left photo to see Asociación Sukû Collection on YouTube & on right photo to see Awajún Collection on YouTube or watch in Gallery tab above.
As we continue our work with Asociación Sukû in Ecuador and Awajún artisans in Perú, other Amazon communities have contacted us to work with them. This has taken ORG by vio® to a new level and we need your support to make this happen. To do our work with more needed funds and continue our current collaboration with extisting communities while gradually and systematically adding new communities.

Rainforest Expeditions is a recipient of The Rainforest Alliance 2012 Sustainable Standard-Setter award. This Peruvian ecotourism company shares with visitors in a sustainable manner the miracles of the Tambopata-Candamo Reserved Zone, 1.5 million hectares of pristine, still wild, tropical rainforest encompassing an area of land the size of Connecticut and stretching from the Andean highlands to the Amazon lowlands. It includes the Tambopata National Reserve, a 275,000-hectare conservation unit created by the Peruvian government in 1990 to protect the watersheds of the Tambopata and Candamo rivers. It is adjacent to the 1-million-hectare Bahuaja Sonene National Park. Conservation and ecotourism is helping to protect some of the last untouched lowland and premontane tropical humid forests in the Amazon.
Since 1989, guests of first one and now three Rainforest Expedition eco-lodges have added value to the region’s standing tropical rainforest. A sensitively conceived and managed (in some cases by native communities) touristic infrastructure creates a competitive alternative to such unsustainable economic uses as clear cutting the forest for timber or for cattle grazing. The partnerships Rainforest Expeditions has forged with local people eager to share Amazonian traditions with guests provide connection, expertise, adventure and access to wildlife in the jungles of Tambopata. Rainforest Expeditions has been verified and certified “a sustainable tourism business” by the Rainforest Alliance. www.perunature.com

<h3>Short Summary<br/>
</h3>
<p>We are looking for financial support to take a team of 6 fashion creatives (5 UK, 1 Iceland) for a week long couture, editorial photo shoot in Iceland. The collaborative shoot aims to showcase couture-style designs, inspired by Imperial Russia and Fabergé Eggs, and present them in the dramatic and diverse landscapes of Iceland. </p>
<h3>The Designer</h3>
<p>Christopher Niari is an aspiring Fashion designer from the North East of England. He is self-taught and has been practicing in Fashion for 7 years. He has also been providing a bespoke commission service for 3 years, specialising in tailoring and corsetry. He draws his inspiration from the world of Haute Couture and designers such as Christian Dior, Thierry Mugler, Alexander McQueen and John Galliano.</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Photographer</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Richard Powazynski is an internationally published fashion photographer also from the North East of England. He began his work in photography shooting solely landscapes while travelling overseas, but found his passion for editorial and high fashion photography on his return to the UK. Richard has a preference for working in a team to produce fashion images that also draw on his experience and expertise with shooting outstanding landscapes and interesting locations. He takes inspiration from the work of photographers such as Patrick Demarchelier and Paolo Roversi.</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Team</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Besides Christopher and Richard, the team consists of talented creative individuals, carefully selected to enhance the outcome of the final editorial.</p>
<p>A hair and make-up artist has been selected due to his ability to create beautiful looks to compliment the outfits and concept. His work has caught the attention of both Illamasqua and MAC gaining him sponsorship from one and employment from the other.</p>
<p>Two models will be sporting 3 of the designs each over the course of the shoot. One model is coming along with the team from the UK, while the other model is from Iceland   and will be able to help guide us around her home country.</p>
<p>There will also be an assistant coming along on the project to help out with all photography, dressing and preparation needs.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Inspiration Behind the Concept &amp; Designs</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Inspiration for the 6 designs has been taken from Imperial Fabergé Eggs commissioned by the Romanov's, the last ruling family of Imperial Russia. Having visited Russia and having a love for the allure of Russian opulence and the Romanov Dynasty, Christopher chose the Imperial Eggs, crafted by the House of Fabergé in Paris, for their representation of the wealth, power and decadence displayed by the Russian aristocrats and royalty of that era.</p>
<p>The six outfits will be inspired by Christopher's favourite Eggs; the silhouettes of each look will be heavily influenced by the Dior 'New Look' of 1947 (padded hips, corseted waist and rounded shoulders). Christian Dior himself had a fascination with Russia, so marrying the Dior silhouette with Fabergé Egg embellishment seems appropriate, especially with the heavy Russian links and association with wealth and effortless luxury.</p>

<br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Location  </h3>Our chosen location for the shoot is Iceland. This is due to the country's diverse landscape and breathtaking natural beauty which Richard will be able to use to his advantage. The similarities between some areas of the Icelandic countryside and the Siberian tundra also make it a prime location to create the editorial with an extra Russian element. Iceland was also chosen due to its ease of access from the UK; the lack of having to apply for Visas and the extra added expenses required to shoot in Russia benefits both the team and the costs involved with the project.<p></p>
<p>Iceland's general infrastructure, namely the 'Route 1' ring road allows easy access to many locations of outstanding natural beauty and diversity. With the aid of a camper van we can easily travel throughout the country, staying on the road instead of having to return to a 'base camp' such as a hotel or other static accommodation. This gives our team many options regarding location choice while also provides a varied backdrop throughout the complete set of all 6 outfits.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Our Plans and Requirements</h3>The dates our whole team has set aside to conduct the project is from Wednesday 5th - Wednesday 12th February 2014, flying from Manchester International Airport to Reykjavik International Airport (Wednesday flights from Manchester is the cheapest option). Upon arrival, the camper van will be picked up from Reykjavik and the journey will begin. The photo shoots will commence on the Thursday and will continue through until the evening of the following Tuesday.<p></p>
<p>The money achieved through this campaign will go towards paying for all 5 required  return flights from the UK to Iceland, Camper van hire and insurance and petrol to cover the approximate 1,339 kilometre round journey via the 'Route 1' ring road. It will also go towards the cost for the embellishments needed for the designs to create an authentic 'Fabergé Egg' feel; freshwater pearls, Swarovski crystals and fine gold and silver chains are among the required embellishments. All the fabrics such as the tailoring and corsetry supplies and fashion fabrics like Duchess Satin, Faux Fur and Embroidery Tulle are already being amassed using the designer's own personal funds.</p>
<p>All members of the team have agreed to work free of charge, making the project purely for art and collaborative purposes in which all of our collective creative skills can be appreciated.</p>
<h3>A Bit About the Perks</h3>
<p>The perks that we will be offering are unique and exclusive strictly to the individuals who fund this project. No additional merchandise or products of any kind will be made after the completion of this project. All funders will be acknowledged on various social media platforms and websites owned and used by the team as thanks for your involvement... without you there would simply be no project!</p>
<p>The smaller perks ranging from donations of £5 to £50 are all tokens for your support and investment in the project. Perks from £100+ are strictly limited and are designed to make larger donations more rewarding and closely related to the project.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand that not all supporters have the ability to donate financially, however to show your support we would appreciate helping us get the word out about our project. </p>
<p>Another great way you could help is to use the Indiegogo share tools.</p></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","Short Summary

The money achieved through this campaign will go towards paying for all 5 required  return flights from the UK to Iceland, Camper van hire and insurance and petrol to cover the approximate 1,339 kilometre round journey via the 'Route 1' ring road. It will also go towards the cost for the embellishments needed for the designs to create an authentic 'Fabergé Egg' feel; freshwater pearls, Swarovski crystals and fine gold and silver chains are among the required embellishments. All the fabrics such as the tailoring and corsetry supplies and fashion fabrics like Duchess Satin, Faux Fur and Embroidery Tulle are already being amassed using the designer's own personal funds.
All members of the team have agreed to work free of charge, making the project purely for art and collaborative purposes in which all of our collective creative skills can be appreciated.

<h3>About Us</h3>
<p></p>
<p>We are the parents of two lively kids, Vincent- 4 1/2 and Lilly 3. They are very energetic and we constantly drag them outdoors to play in the snow, in the forest, on the beach, in the garden, etc. We got frustrated that none of their clothes withstood the games they played. It didn’t take long before their clothing was torn or ripped. Also we were amazed with the poor fit of some clothes. A lot of them are designed to expose their lower back as soon as they are not standing at attention. We needed to find clothes for our kids to play in. We couldn’t find any.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/199363/files/20131115064715-AnaKlasFamily.jpg?1384526835"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>We also want to question how things are done in the industry and to show customers another way, to challenge peoples ”buy and throw” culture. We are a small company and we are avoiding the big company systems of doing things. Mass-production, lead times, and the retail thinking made us realize that this is not how we want to do and be in business. </p>
<p>We have worked in the outdoor apparel business for about a decade. Even though we have been part of fantastic products, it has always been a compromise between product quality and production price. Get a cheaper fabric, get rid of one pocket, we need to sell x amount to be able to get the price down. </p>
<p>We began to question and had to rethink the traditional cycles of development, production and distribution. We want to make honest products with no compromises. Get the best materials we can afford, work with the best manufacturers and the best suppliers, and all this in a sustainable manner. We want the customer to know where the product has been made and with what materials. </p>
<p>The fast paced mass-production industry was not something we wanted to be a part of. Usually in all retail clothing companies most of the markup goes to the middlemen, the retailers, and to the big corporation that has to satisfy its shareholders. We want to put you, the end customer, first. We want to invest back in the company, making the best products possible. </p>

<h3>What We Do</h3>
<p></p>
<p>We make durable and sustainable unisex apparel for kids to play in. Clothes that are comfortable, practical, stylish and last when the kids are running, sliding, skateboarding, or just being kids.</p>
<p>We are kicking off Alice &amp; Ted with a pant, a long-sleeved t-shirt and a t-shirt. However we have more garments designed and lined up to be added to the collection. There are large costs associated with purchasing fabric, producing the garments, and size adjusting the patterns. Therefore we take things one step at a time. We don’t want to compromize the quality of the products.<br/></p>
<p>We need your help to get this project started. Please support us to make this happen!</p>

<h3>Sustainability</h3>
<p><span>It is important that we leave the earth in a good condition for our kids so they can pass it on to the next generation in their turn. </span>Today our earth is in deep need of more friends and we want to do as much as possible to do as little damage as we can on this planet. That's why sustainability is very important for us. We want our children and their children to be able to enjoy our fantastic nature as much as we enjoy it now.</p>
<p><strong><span>Ethical Production</span></strong></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We choose carefully the partners we like to work with. Not only are our co-workers people we like working with, but they share our view on environmental consciousness. We have an overview of the entire production, from fabric production to transportation of final garment to customer. We have all our suppliers close to us in Europe and they share our view on ethical production. </span></p>

<p>The basic concept of Alice &amp; Ted is to make durable clothes. We choose durable fabrics and material and design the garments with e.g. reinforcements to make them last a long time.

<h3>Our Products</h3>Once we get started with Alice &amp; Ted we will as soon as we can expand the collection to a full range of playwear for kids. We are starting off with three products that we need your help to produce. These are:</span></span><p><br/></p><p><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""></span></span></span></p><p></p><p><b>The Play Pant - Unisex</b></p><p>We have made the best play pant in the world! Made out of a strong, long lasting polyamide/Supplex fabric, with a very ergonomic pattern construction that allows the boy/girl to play without restricting them. This style is perfect in almost all weather conditions. With the reinforced knees and bum, the kids can easily crawl around on the ground when playing without you worrying too much of them tearing the pants. A simple, clean style that is easy and comfortable to use.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/210893/files/20131120001149-playpantindie4.jpg?1384935109"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><br/></p><p>See the video when our test pilot is testing the Play Pant:</p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""435"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/FIKYfWsMP9Y?feature=oembed"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><p></p><p><b>The Polar Bear Longsleeve - Unisex</b></p><p>The Polar Bear LS tee is made in a slightly heavier stretchy organic cotton quality, cut in a regular fit, with a dropped back hem to cover the kids' back when squatting or playing on the ground. With flatlock seams throughout you don't have to worry for chafing. With the polar bear chest print we want to raise awareness about the endangered bears. To make you think about what's going on in the world instead of designing yet another pink cat print with a shiny tiara.<br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/192004/files/20131112021751-polarbearlsindie2.jpg?1384251471"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/192005/files/20131112021845-pbprint.jpg?1384251525"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Polar bears live in the Arctic ice and feed on other animals that live in the area, such as seals, dead whales and walruses. Global warming causes the ice to melt and thus polar bear’s hunting grounds and living areas. The seals seek out other places and leave the polar bears hungry. Polar bears are in turn forced to swim mile long distances in search of a neighboring island or larger floes. The long distances mean that polar bears drown because they do not have the energy to swim more than a few miles at a time. When they are lacking food their low energy level holds them back even more. If we can’t stop the globing warming, we need to give the polar bears swimming aid, or 2/3 of the population will be extinct by 2050.<br/><p></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><b>The Panda Tee - Unisex</b></p><p>The Panda Tee is made in a slightly heavier stretchy organic cotton quality, cut in a regular fit, with a dropped back hem to cover the kids' back when squatting or playing on the ground. With flatlock seams throughout you don't have to worry for chafing. With the panda chest print we want to raise awareness about the endangered pandas. To make you think about what's going on in the world instead of designing yet another hero print with stars.<br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/196949/files/20131114062525-pandateeindie3.jpg?1384439125"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/192009/files/20131112022014-ptprint.jpg?1384251614"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>Pandas are dying out mainly because of one main reason: habitat loss. Their main source of food is bamboo, which takes a long time to grow. This problem wasn't present when pandas were spread throughout the massive southeast of Asia, including China. Hence, when a forest of bamboo was being consumed by them, or a forest bloomed out, they could simply move to another bamboo forest, but as the forests have been cut down the pandas are finding food supply harder to find after a bloom out. Wild pandas have been reported to die because of starvation simply because they cannot reach the next bamboo forest quickly enough, or at all.<br/><p></p><p><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><br/></span></span></span></p><p><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""></span></span></span></p><h3>The Fit - Unisex</h3>
<p>The Play Pant is designed in a slightly loose fit to givet
the boy/girl freedom of movement when wearing the pant. From the knee down the leg
is cut in a narrower shape to prevent extra fabric from getting in the way when
running. The back rise is extra high and shaped to cover the back when the
child is squatting or playing on the ground. The bum and knee areas are
articulated which gives a general better fit and also enhanced freedom of
movement when palying. The waist and leg cuffs have integrated elastic to
secure that the pant stays on the body properly.</p><p>The Polar Bear Longsleeve has a normal fit, with raglan cut sleeves. The raglan construction makes it easier for the girl/boy to raise its arms and the longsleeve tee will stay in place, without exposing her/his midriff. The dropped back hem will cover the back. </p><p>The Panda Tee has a normal fit, with a set in sleeve construction. A fantastic looking normal tee with a dropped back hem that covers the childs back when playing. </p><p>All clothes are unisex. We are not putting the garments in a gender stereotypic tray. We are not telling you what color you should buy or which fit the clothes should have based on your child’s gender. Our clothes are for all children, girls and boys like to play as much. Our pieces will allow them to be themselves and to help them grow their own personalities.</p><p><br/></p>
<h3>Fabric and Finish Features</h3><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/216044/files/20131122055120-fabric2.jpg?1385128280"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p>The Play Pants are made of polyamide/Supplex fabric that is very soft against the skin, durable and moisture wicking, has excellent abrasion resistance and strength. The cordura is extremely strong and durable and the supplex gives the fabric a cotton hand feel and look. A perfect combination of modern technology and traditional cotton appeal. The fabric has excellent breathability and dries in a fraction of time when compared to normal cotton fabric in equal thickness. This material is long lasting and very easily cleaned. Because of the water repellency treatment of the fabric the pant will stay dryer longer. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The Play Pants have heavy duty thread throughout the whole garment for durability.</span></p><p>The Polar Bear Longsleeve and the Panda Tee are made of organic cotton material with 5% Elastane for better stability of the fabric and comfort. They are constructed with s<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">oft filament thread in the whole garment.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><br/></span></p><p></p><h3>Direct Sales</h3><p></p><p><b></b></p><p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/189426/files/20131111053353-direct-sales2.jpg?1384176833"" src="""" style=""""/></b></p><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Alice &amp; Ted's playwear are exclusively sold through our website direct to you – without middle hands.</span><br/></p>

<p>We communicate directly with you. We know what you expect from your kids' garments… they deserve the best. Our customers’ requests are not derived from statistic data – we listen to what you say and how you feel about the products you buy for your kids. From this relationship we make our decisions. We feel that this is the best way to develop the best playwear there is.</p>

Their main source of food is bamboo, which takes a long time to grow. This problem wasn't present when pandas were spread throughout the massive southeast of Asia, including China. Hence, when a forest of bamboo was being consumed by them, or a forest bloomed out, they could simply move to another bamboo forest, but as the forests have been cut down the pandas are finding food supply harder to find after a bloom out. Wild pandas have been reported to die because of starvation simply because they cannot reach the next bamboo forest quickly enough, or at all.The Fit - Unisex
The Play Pant is designed in a slightly loose fit to givet
the boy/girl freedom of movement when wearing the pant. From the knee down the leg
is cut in a narrower shape to prevent extra fabric from getting in the way when
running. The back rise is extra high and shaped to cover the back when the
child is squatting or playing on the ground. The bum and knee areas are
articulated which gives a general better fit and also enhanced freedom of
movement when palying. The waist and leg cuffs have integrated elastic to
secure that the pant stays on the body properly.The Polar Bear Longsleeve has a normal fit, with raglan cut sleeves. The raglan construction makes it easier for the girl/boy to raise its arms and the longsleeve tee will stay in place, without exposing her/his midriff. The dropped back hem will cover the back. The Panda Tee has a normal fit, with a set in sleeve construction. A fantastic looking normal tee with a dropped back hem that covers the childs back when playing. All clothes are unisex. We are not putting the garments in a gender stereotypic tray. We are not telling you what color you should buy or which fit the clothes should have based on your child’s gender. Our clothes are for all children, girls and boys like to play as much. Our pieces will allow them to be themselves and to help them grow their own personalities.
Fabric and Finish FeaturesThe Play Pants are made of polyamide/Supplex fabric that is very soft against the skin, durable and moisture wicking, has excellent abrasion resistance and strength. The cordura is extremely strong and durable and the supplex gives the fabric a cotton hand feel and look. A perfect combination of modern technology and traditional cotton appeal. The fabric has excellent breathability and dries in a fraction of time when compared to normal cotton fabric in equal thickness. This material is long lasting and very easily cleaned. Because of the water repellency treatment of the fabric the pant will stay dryer longer. The Play Pants have heavy duty thread throughout the whole garment for durability.The Polar Bear Longsleeve and the Panda Tee are made of organic cotton material with 5% Elastane for better stability of the fabric and comfort. They are constructed with soft filament thread in the whole garment.Direct SalesAlice & Ted's playwear are exclusively sold through our website direct to you – without middle hands.
We are able to pass the savings on to you.That is the reason why customers profit with increased savings over competing brands.
You profit qualitatively by the direct communication. We can afford to use better materials and higher quality production.
No one can answer your questions better than us. From the first idea to the final product, everything lies in our hands. Our knowledge pool is clearly much larger than a dealer/retailer could ever provide.
We communicate directly with you. We know what you expect from your kids' garments… they deserve the best. Our customers’ requests are not derived from statistic data – we listen to what you say and how you feel about the products you buy for your kids. From this relationship we make our decisions. We feel that this is the best way to develop the best playwear there is.
We all know how hard it is to shop with small children. Trying things on can really be difficult. With direct sales, you can try the clothing on at home, when they are up for it and in a good mood.
You can always shop at Alice & Ted. No matter what time it is or what country you are from you can get our garments.
Fantastic playwear with a superior price/performance-ratio directly from us.


Sizing Chart
All our styles come in sizes: 98, 104, 110, 116, 122 and 128. Below is our sizing chart and a guide to help you convert children's clothing sizes between geographical regions.



Here is how you measure.






Height
Measure from the top of the head down to the ground - ensuring the child is barefoot and has his or her heels together and feet flat on the floor. The height in cm = European size.
Chest
Take the tape under the arms and measure around the fullest part of the chest.
Waist
Place the tape measure around the natural waistline, taking care not to pull it too tightly.
Hips
Place the tape measure around the fullest part of the bottom.
Inside leg
Measure with shoes on, from the crotch area to approximately 5cm above the ground.

What Is Next?
We already have the designs ready, fantastic looking prototypes, have strong relationships with our suppliers, and we are ready to go. If we are successfully funded we will work really, really hard to make sure that you will get your products in the agreed timeframe. Watch the video below to see how our first Play Pant prototype was made:LinksOther Ways You Can HelpHelp us spread the word about our campaign.

The Core Closet Collection allows you to have the staples you need to last a long time and have been ethically made.


What We Need & What You Get

The Impact

The textile industry is the second most polluting in our world today and the apparel industry relies heavily on forced labour. We can change that!

The CORE Closet Collection will be manufactured in a ethical and sustainable factory that we work extremely closely with.
We believe in buying less and buying better. We provide options for our clients that are values aligned. And we are committed to showing it's possible to have style while impacting positive change.

A wallet that is specially designed to improve the security of credit cards and protect personal documents using integrated technology.The world’s smartest and most technologically advanced bi-fold wallet, acting as an individual’s best defense against today’s advanced hackers, pickpockets and our own forgetful minds - with 10 smart functions.Wiseward can receive up to 15 credit cards and still remain slim, pocket-sized and easy to use.Following its first successful crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter in 2015, Baggizmo produced and delivered the first series of design bags enabling a more practical and functional way of carrying electronic devices. It was this bag that gave impetus for the development of a new product, Baggizmo Wiseward, which is using integrated technology to improve the protection of personal property when carried around by its owner.Baggizmo Wiseward is intended for urban people – primarily those who adopt new technologies, but also those who want a more secure and more functional wallet that protects its contents from theft. It is ideal for those who keep forgetting where they have left their wallet or cell phone – this product will certainly make their life a little bit easier.***Check out our FASHION video***. ::::::::::: RFID PROTECTIONThe crooks of today don't have to be very intelligent or dexterous - all they have to do is stand near you to steal precious data from your credit cards. Luckily, this is where Wiseward jumps in. You see, the RFID chips embedded in your cards work by using radio waves to communicate, and that's what makes it possible to read them without actual physical contact. But, that also means that someone with a skimmer device can easily scan through your pocket, without you realizing it.  Fortunately, radio waves can be interrupted and blocked, and that’s exactly how Wiseward wallet works: it encases your credit cards in a material that interferes with radio waves. No radio waves – no skimming; you don't have to fear anymore while riding on a crowded bus, train or subway, or while standing in a queue close to other people.To make things more practical, Wiseward has special two-zone card sections: one with RFID protection, and the other without protection. The section without RFID protection enables you to use the cards that must stay unblocked all the time - so you don't have to pull them out of the wallet if you want to open your garage, enter a subway station etc. .::::::::::: MOBILE APP & BLUETOOTH CONNECTIONWe know you are really attached to your wallet, and there's nothing wrong with it. That's the reason we attached some really cool functions to Wiseward; for example, it is always closely connected with your mobile phone via Bluetooth, using two-way communication. When Wiseward is connected with your mobile, a special application takes care of it, armed with a bunch of smart features like geolocation, proximity detection, fall detection, detection of the wallet's position in the room and the sound alarm signaling that the wallet has been lost or stolen..Remember those I can't find my #$%&* wallet or phone moments? You can breathe freely now, because with Wiseward wallet these moments are history.. Baggizmo Wiseward APP features includes: battery status; wallet movement detection notifying you if it falls; a feature signalling by push notification and/or sound alarm that the wallet is almost out of reach; detection and tracking of wallet usage by indicating its open/closed status; wallet within the range with visual tracking info and last-seen feature; NFC programming option, RGB light personalization color wheal with the light-color-changing color option and UV lamp detector; wallet and/or mobile phone detection with mobile sound alarm by touching wallet and vice versa, personalization with unique wallet ID and custom naming of your wallet; the option of registering more wallets on a single device. .. and maybe even more :)The Wiseward application will be included in smart wallet pack and will be available from Google Play and Apple Store. You just synchronize your Wiseward with your smartphone and you’re good to go. Baggizmo Wiseward APP makes sure you always got your eye on your wallet.  ::::::::::: MAGNET SENSORWiseward wallet has another ace up its sleeve: a magnet sensor connected with your mobile phone, for detecting if it's folded or not, like when someone disrupts your privacy by touching the wallet or tries to open it for some reason while you are away. For all the above we have a song: U Can't Touch This!  ::::::::::: GYROSCOPE + ACCELEROMETER + PIEZO BUZZER ALARMGyro… accelero… what? Don't worry, translated in plain English it goes for clever little gizmos that are always on an alert, helping your wallet conclude that somebody is fiddling with it or trying to run away with it. Luckily, smart is the buzzword when it comes to Wiseward: the smart buzzer sound alarm, together with Vibrate or Push notification function on your mobile phone, will alarm you if it changes its position in a suspicious way… or if it is accidentally dropped on the ground while you walk, run, or ride a bike. Just relax and do your thing, Wiseward will be safe and sound.  ::::::::::: UV LAMP DETECTORCredit card rules, but the cash is still the king - that's why this UV lamp detector in your Wiseward will be of good use, either when you check the bills of your own domestic currency, or when you travel abroad and get in contact with all those strange looking banknotes: just inspect them under the UV light and learn if they are bona fide or not. ::::::::::: PROGRAMMABLE NFC CHIPThe heart of your Wiseward is an NFC chip that can easily be programmed to store various information - it means that you can make your wallet do all sorts of things like, for instance, to serve as an electronic business card, or as a pass for entering an office or parking garage..::::::::::: WIRELESS CHARGINGAlthough Wiseward is equipped with a long-life battery, you should never let it run out of juice - that's why we fitted it with simple and cableless inductive charging. With Wiseward APP you can extend the duration of your wallet's battery by disabling some other functionalities.Wiseward is compatible with any wireless charging pads certified by Qi standard.  ::::::::::: RGB ILLUMINATIONLED there be light in your wallet! Wiseward is equipped with a small LED lamp that turns on and illuminates its interior when you open the wallet – a function that sometimes really comes in handy. It also has a cute bonus: this lamp is programmable by a mobile app, so it can be switched on and off and it can illuminate your Wiseward with a customized color...Baggizmo Wiseward has been designed in Croatia and is completely made in Europe..FSC® certificated eco-friendly innovative high-quality durable materials, that are water repellent, soft and pleasant to touch.Made in Italy > originality, beauty and high-quality textures, emphasizing the essence of the Made in Italy fashion and style...Two different patterns, each in 3 colors to choose fromMinimalistic diamond shaped pattern material on the outside and smooth matt material on the inside. You will get an email to select your color at the end of the project.Minimalistic true blue diamond shaped pattern material on the outside and smooth matt mint green material on the inside.Minimalistic cardinal red diamond shaped pattern material on the outside and smooth matt ivory beige material on the inside.Minimalistic jet black diamond shaped pattern material on the outside and smooth matt jet black material on the inside.Noble blue tweed pattern material on the outside and smooth matt midnight blue material on the inside.Sandy beige tweed pattern material on the outside and smooth matt ivory beige material on the inside.Vintage brown tweed pattern material on the outside and smooth matt chocolate brown material on the inside. .LIMITED EDITION= gadget bag + smart wallet - both produced only in 120 pieces and with signed certificate.Baggizmo Wiseward is a new contemporary version of the classic men's bi-fold wallet, slim fit and pocket size, minimalistic and easy to use.

Your adventure hoodie easily folds up into a pillow (way more effective than the chintzy ones they offer on airlines) that provides a substantial place to rest your head. It’s also a convenient way to transport your hoodie, when you don’t need it.

 ADV3NTURE JACKET - Black All-Weather ADV3NTURE Jacket with Black zipper POCKETS & FEATURESThere are nine (9) pockets and fourteen (14) features that are seamlessly incorporated in the ADV3NTURE HOODIE. We set out to create a hoodie that is full of innovations, but is primarily a stylish high-end hoodie that you will want to wear every day.NINE (9) POCKETSThe ADV3NTURE HOODIE has nine pockets. While each pocket was designed for a purpose, what you use it for is up to you. Each person and each adventure is unique, so use our descriptions as suggestions. And if you find any other uses for the pockets, let us know!ZIPPERED SIDE POCKETS (2) - Unzip to warm your hands, or zip up to secure your belongings. They zip up (not down), so the rubber zipper pull tucks behind the pocket flap. (In the All-Weather Jacket, they're lined with incredibly soft Sherpa material) FRONT CARGO POCKETS (2) - These pockets are essential to the ADV3NTURE HOODIE. They’re convenient enough to drop things into (camera, phone, wallet, maps, cash, change, etc), and big enough for odd-sized items (big headphones, maps, granola bars, children's toys, crayons, etc). And they are secured with two plastic-covered metal snaps. 
 ZIPPERED PASSPORT POCKET - You’ll never fumble for your passport (or wallet, or cash, or I.D.), because you’ll know that it’s secured close to your chest in a zippered pocket. This pocket has a rubber zipper pull.
 INSIDE WATER-RESISTANT POCKET - Adventure is about an element of uncertainty. You never know when a water-resistant inside pocket will come in handy, but it certainly will! This is the perfect pocket for your phone and earbuds.
 NEOPRENE KOOZIE POCKET (1) - This is one of the carry-overs from The Drinking Jacket. But, now the pocket is sealed at the bottom, and is the perfect size for a phone (Android or iPhone 6+). It provides a padded pocket for your cell phone OR is an insulated place to hold your beverage, while also keeping it chilled.
 ARM POCKET (1) - This is also a carry-over from the Drinking Jacket, but we switched arms to make it more convenient to 90% of the population (right-handed people - not that south paws can’t use it!).MINI-PEN POCKET (1) This unique pocket holds a mini-pen, because you never know when you’ll need a writing implement. The pocket holds pens up to 4"" long. There are several inexpensive mini-pens that fit in this pocket.
 FOURTEEN (14) FEATURESThe ADV3NTURE HOODIE has 14 distinct features, although it could be argued that it actually has more. While each feature was designed with a specific purpose in mind, we know you'll come up with other use for them! 
 SUNGLASS HOLDER - People most often lose their sunglasses when day turns to night or sunny skies turn cloudy and they don’t have anywhere to put their sunglasses. With the sunglass holder, you have a place to easily store or access your sunglasses, so you don’t leave them on a table, in a car, or wherever you would have put them down.

PILLOW CONVERSION - You never know when you’ll need a pillow! Missed a flight, long car ride, boring lecture, or maybe you just want to lay on the grass with your four-legged friend? Your adventure hoodie easily folds up into a pillow (way more effective than the chintzy ones they offer on airlines) that provides a substantial place to rest your head. It’s also a convenient way to transport your hoodie, when you don’t need it. The pillow converts both ways, so you can have a super soft pillow (with the lining on the outside), or a more durable pillow (with the lining on the inside) if you don't want to get the lining dirty in public places.
 BOTTLE-OPENER ZIPPER - The top zipper is a bottle opener. It's much smaller than the bottle opener on the Drinking Jacket, but your bottle opener is still there when you need it. REFLECTIVE CABLING - There is reflective cabling sewn into the front button pockets and on the hood (from the front to the back). They are covered with a thin body-color material to make it barely visible during the day. But, in our proprietary process than maintains 91% of its reflectivity, you will be seen at night even in very dim light. REFLECTIVE LOGO - The Monkey (Pleepleus) logo on your hoodie is reflective. We used a tinted reflective ink to make our logo subtle and blend in with the fabric color (of all of the ADV3NTURE HOODIE), but it still maintains 95% of its reflective properties. Let our logo be seen when you want/need to be seen! FOLDABLE GLOVES - The cuffs of the hoodie fold out to serve as gloves. They’ll provide a cozy home for your hands when the weather turns cold. They’re also handy for keeping your beverage cold and your hands warm. BEVERAGE GRIPS - The pattern on the gloves provides more grip when holding a beverage. But they also add more grip for times when you didn’t know you needed it. RETURN HOME FEATURE - OK, it's not as much a sophisticated electronic GPS component as it is a place to write your phone number or email address, but it's arguably just as effective. Write your info in the jacket and, if you leave your ADV3NTURE HOODIE somewhere, the finder will know how to contact you! UNDERARM VENTS- The subcutaneous fat in your body acts as a natural insulator. You have less fat in your armpits, which makes them serve as the your torso’s cooling center. So, a simple vent has been added under the armpits to allow your body to remove excess heat. VENTILATION ZIPPER - The addition of a bottom zipper enables you to cool off, without having to take off your hoodie. Unzipping just the top zipper can also work, but it may cause your hoodie to slip off your shoulders. By unzipping the bottom zipper, you can cool off, while keeping your hoodie in place.  OVER-SIZED HOOD - The hood is 5” larger than a standard hoodie, and is lined with super-soft fabric. This enables you to pull the hoodie over your eyes, to shut out the light and help you sleep. ADJUSTABLE HOOD SNAPS - The hood is over-sized so it can cover your eyes when you want to take a nap. But, there is a button in the back of the hood that let's you adjust the size, so it doesn't cover your eyes other times that you're using the hood.  EXTRA SOFT HOOD LINING - The hood is lined with extra soft fabric which adds and extra level of insulating. When you're traveling, it creates a nice, soft, home-away-from-home. DRAWSTRINGS - Use the drawstrings to adjust the hoodie, as well as blocking out the light, while you pull the hoodie over your eyes for a nap. ALL-WEATHER VERSION FEATURES

The All-Weather ADV3NTURE JACKET is lined with incredibly soft Sherpa fabric in the hood and body. What is Sherpa fabric? It is a super-plush ""fleecy pile"" which is most often used to make stuffed animals, blankets and pillows. It is, in a word, luxurious.
 SHERPA-LINED JACKET - The body of the jacket is lined with Velveteen Sherpa fabric that is as soft as a baby bunny (we actually tested it, which may have just been an excuse to go play with baby bunnies). It provides a layer of insulation and a layer of luxurious softness. SHERPA-LINED HOOD - The hood is lined with the same Sherpa fabric as the body. When you pull it over your head, it envelopes your head in softness. SHERPA-LINED SIDE POCKETS - The zippered side pockets are lined in the same Sherpa material to provide an extra soft place to warm your hands. Your cold hands will thank you. QUILTED ARM-LINING - The sleeves are lined with a quilted in a soft cotton/polyester blend that provides a cozy and warm place for your arms, even if you're wearing a T-shirt underneath and have bare arms. RIDICULOUSLY SOFT PILLOW CONVERSION - The ADV3NTURE HOODIE and ADV3NTURE JACKET quickly and easily convert into a pillow. Roll the jacket into the oversized hood and snap it shut. If rolled inside-out, it creates a super-soft pillow. If you roll it outside-in, your jacket becomes compact to fit in your bag. 
 IMPORTANT STUFFSIZING - We're offering Men's and Women's sizes of the ADV3NTURE Hoodie and ADV3NTURE Jacket. The sizes for Men's and Women's are comparable to a standard hoodie. To find your perfect size, grab your favorite hoodie (soon to be your second favorite hoodie!) and lay it on a flat surface. Grab a tape measure and measure the dimensions that you see in the image below. Then find the size that most closely matches it from the 22 sizes we offer. If you have a question, let us know. We'd love to hear your input!US & Imperial Measurements Metric (""International"") Measurements

They produce top-quality garments, and this garment is no different. We have chosen premium fabrics for the hoodies, and they are being sewn with premium threads and stitching.TEMPERATURE RANGE - The ADV3NTURE Hoodie CLASSIC and LIMITED are medium-weight hoodies which are ideal for cool days 48°F (9C)° to the high 69°F (20°C). The ADV3NTURE Jacket is made with a water-resistant shell and Sherpa lined body, hood and pockets, along with quilted fabric in the arms. It's ideal for temperatures from 33°F (1°C) to 64°F (18°C).

<p>As children, we always dreamed about space. Our eyes would see something down heart on Planet Earth but inevitably return to the stars, looking up and wondering if we would ever get there ourselves. Then, in July 1969, we did: the astronauts of Apollo 11 led us to the moon. Although the footsteps were few, we took them together. That was all of us, up there, exploring that big black wonder from our dreams. That was all of us, escaping the confines of gravity.</p>

<p> Now, the Moon 1969 watch, a Bovarro Swiss-made automatic timepiece, is here to celebrate that achievement. Designed to resemble the hatch on the Apollo 11 spacecraft, bezels and all, this is a watch that is both unique and functional.</p>
<div data-id=""13973626""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1480543336/hbbkftmtxtom6oxredzz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></figure></div>
<p> Initially we created the bezel to look exactly like the hatch with the 42 screws, but the look on the watch did not quite come out as nice, so we decided to reduce the screws around the bezel down to 8 , and shape the crown like the knob on the right side of the hatch, and the look of the watch came out exactly the way we planned.</p>

<h1>Why ETA 2824-2?</h1>
<div>We have considered many important factors to chose the movement that we would need for the Bovarro Watches: reliability, longevity and accuracy.</div>
<div>ETA is the largest and most well known  supplier of movements in Switzerland, which supplies movements to famous Swiss luxury brands.</div>

<h1>WHY DOUBLE DOMED SAPPHIRE CRYSTAL</h1>
<div>We want your Bovarro watch to last for generations, so we decided to choose the best and hardest crystal there is - Double Domed Sapphire Crystal.</div>
<div data-id=""13939623""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1480543353/hzhexpdo55wwz3hyapvu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></figure></div>
<div>Sapphire is the most expensive glass crystal material and the most scratch resistant. It is a very hard, transparent material made of crystallizing aluminum oxide at very high temperatures.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Double Domed: The arch on both sides of the Sapphire Crystal  makes it better able to dissipate the forces of impact, and once treated with an inner A/R coating it looks almost like a quality lens the dial really ""pops"" sharp and clear.</div>
<div> </div>

<p>Bovarro has been created by  Bob and Ary, two brothers and designers from Vancouver. With 3 successful Kickstarter campaigns under out belt, we have shipped over 2,500 Ferro watches over the past two years. Thanks to Kickstarter backers that made it possible.

</div></div>","THE ALL NEW BOVARRO  AUTOMATIC WATCH HAND ASSEMBLED IN SWITZERLAND
 
 
New BLACK MOON LIMITED EDITION pledge tiers now available for Black Friday Weekend!


An automatic Swiss made watch inspired by Apollo 11

As children, we always dreamed about space. Our eyes would see something down heart on Planet Earth but inevitably return to the stars, looking up and wondering if we would ever get there ourselves. Then, in July 1969, we did: the astronauts of Apollo 11 led us to the moon. Although the footsteps were few, we took them together. That was all of us, up there, exploring that big black wonder from our dreams. That was all of us, escaping the confines of gravity.

 

 

Earlier pledge tiers and LTD editions are selling out fast. Thanks to all the awesome backers. 
 

 Now, the Moon 1969 watch, a Bovarro Swiss-made automatic timepiece, is here to celebrate that achievement. Designed to resemble the hatch on the Apollo 11 spacecraft, bezels and all, this is a watch that is both unique and functional.

 Initially we created the bezel to look exactly like the hatch with the 42 screws, but the look on the watch did not quite come out as nice, so we decided to reduce the screws around the bezel down to 8 , and shape the crown like the knob on the right side of the hatch, and the look of the watch came out exactly the way we planned.

Bovarro Collections come in 3 Series / 2 Sizes:

 
Gold Watch Limited Edition Series  for the Golden 1969 History:
The Limited Edition Gold Series Watches will come with Solid 18 K Gold  Case (42 or 44 mm), Gold Back Case, Gold Crown and Gold Strap Buckle.  
You can chose any of the above series in Solid 18 K Gold Case.

  And a Piano finish luxury box to store this prestigious History

Limited Edition Models (#0,00,1-500) will be available combined in all the models. You will choose your watch after the campaign and we will engrave the number on the case. None Limited Edition Watches will come with hard back case with the Moon Engravings. 

 The easy to read black dial of the Lunar Series boasts luminescent hours dots at 12, 3, 6 and 9 o'clock positions and, luminescent moon at 6 o'clock and date window at 3 o'clock.

Orbit models come with a more minimalist index free dial. The Orbit model has larger luminescent hour dots at 12, 3, 6 and 9 o'clock positions.

Celestial model dials hour marks have been omitted to make it look more minimal. 
All 3 models come in both 42 and 46 mm cases.
Stretch Goal #3
When reached $170,000 every watch will come with a set of strap removing tools.

Stretch Goal #1 REACHED!
Now all backers will receive an extra pair of Genuine Leather Straps at no cost. 

 Stretch Goal #2
Initially this stretch goal was st at $160,000. But to thank all our backers and spice things up, we have decieded to reduce it by $20,000 down to $140,000! We believe in team work. So please spread the word by shaing this project with everybody you know.

         
      
Precisely made, each of Bovarro's components are crafted out of the highest-grade parts and materials available; the Bovarro Moon 1969 watches come in  46mm and 42 mm  diameter with 24mm  and 22 mm lugs. The double-domed sapphire crystal is durable and scratch-proof. Water-resistant up to 100 meters; the screw down crown is engraved with Bovarro's double ""RR"" logo.

The 25 jewel ETA 2824-2 decorated movement will keep your time  accurate for a very long time.

Why ETA 2824-2?
We have considered many important factors to chose the movement that we would need for the Bovarro Watches: reliability, longevity and accuracy.
ETA is the largest and most well known  supplier of movements in Switzerland, which supplies movements to famous Swiss luxury brands.

Reading time with Bovarro Moon 1969 is easy due to its minimal design.The moon and round indexes on the dial are topped with strong luminescent coating so you can easily read the time in the dark.

WHY DOUBLE DOMED SAPPHIRE CRYSTAL
We want your Bovarro watch to last for generations, so we decided to choose the best and hardest crystal there is - Double Domed Sapphire Crystal.

Sapphire is the most expensive glass crystal material and the most scratch resistant. It is a very hard, transparent material made of crystallizing aluminum oxide at very high temperatures.
 
Double Domed: The arch on both sides of the Sapphire Crystal  makes it better able to dissipate the forces of impact, and once treated with an inner A/R coating it looks almost like a quality lens the dial really ""pops"" sharp and clear.
 

 

Swissness is the key to a superior quality watch. All Bovarro watches are Swiss Made and will come with a Authenticity of Swiss Made watch certificate.

 

 

 

With pride  We stand behind our watches and are committed to class A service. Each Bovarro watch will come with a limited warranty of flaws in workmanship and materials for a period of two (2) years after receiving your watch.

 Great things come in nice packages. Bovarro watches will arrive to your door in high quality polished piano finish black wooden box. Kickstarter backers will also receive a 5 cm moon model so you can share this great Lunar history with the ones around you

 

 

 

 

 We have estimated the delivery to be in May, but we might be able to deliver the watches about 2-4 weeks sooner. This is just an estimation.

Bovarro has been created by  Bob and Ary, two brothers and designers from Vancouver. With 3 successful Kickstarter campaigns under out belt, we have shipped over 2,500 Ferro watches over the past two years. Thanks to Kickstarter backers that made it possible. Because of your past support, we are now able to present to you our very fist Swiss Made watch.

 Here is just a few of what some backers and other folks had to say about our past watches:Some nameas are covered for privacy reasons.

 

 

As the final design / tech drawings , prototyping and testing phases have been successfully accomplished, we are finally confident and ready to manufacture the watches for our backers. We have the manufacturer and other part suppliers ready to make the watches with our green signal. All we need is your support. In order to bring Bovarro watches to your wrists, we need to meet our factory's minimum order quantity requirement; and this will only be possible with your support. By making a pledge, you will secure a high quality Bovarro Swiss Made Watch  at a special Kickstarter price.

Not having the proper attire leads to:

Exposure to the elements: Dehydration, hypothermia, aggravated allergies and skin conditions or worsening pre-existing medical conditions.

Going Hungry: 73% of low-income families cut back on food to provide household goods, including clothing, for their children.

Embarrassment and Truancy: Children avoid school to minimize ridicule and teasing, and parents worry about keeping their kid safe from the weather.

Harder Time in School: Studies have shown that clothing need directly leads to behavioral problems and academic distress.   

We are going into production ASAP after the campaign to make sure that the jackets are ready for delivery for back to school!We have teamed up with 170+ non-profits in communities throughout the US to ensure we get the jackets into the right hands and are adding more daily. We have dedicated resources working directly with non-profits to reach kids in need as quickly as possible. If we don’t have a partner in your area, do not worry, we will have one ASAP!

<p>The ParaPull is a short paracord zipper pull style lanyard that makes it easy to pull your Pocket Clip out when you need to get a handle on it.  The ParaPull works equally well connecting loose items to either a Pivot or a Slide.</p>

<p><b>Tentative Schedule</b></p></figure></div>
<ul>
<li>April &amp; May - Integrate consumer feedback, finalize design for manufacturing, finalize quotes (4 weeks)</li>
<li>May 20 thru 31 - Place tooling and production p.o.’s</li>
<li>June &amp; July - Complete production tooling, first shots (8 weeks)</li>
<li>August - Initiate pilot runs of each product, initial beta testing, assuming production tweaks are minor, move ahead with production runs (4 weeks)</li>
<li>September - Production runs (6 weeks)</li>
<li>October - Final QC, package, and ship to backers (2 weeks)</li>
<li>October 31 - Complete fulfillment to all Kickstarter backers</li>
<li>November - Complete fulfillment to all Indiegogo backers</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of the large number of independent items in production at the same time (6), we will fulfill each order as soon as all of those products for that particular order have been received, tested, and packaged.</p>
<p>Unless we encounter an unforeseen issue which delays one or more products more than four weeks from the estimated end of the campaign, we will not be splitting shipments.</p>

The Pocket Clip and improved modular stacking system gives you a whole new array of carry options for Keyport Modules in addition to attaching them to the Keyport Pivot and Keyport Slide 3.0. The Keyport system is the most advanced EDC solution available because of its one-of-a-kind modularity, its broad range of customization choices, and its wide variety of carry options.Anywhere Tools are part of a system designed upon the principals of  convenience, utility, and style. Our goal is to transform your everyday carry from a bulky, oddly shaped, noisy assemblage of things you always haul around with you to a fully customized set of tools and tech that accompany you on all of your adventures without getting in the way.Modular - Take only the items you want with you. No need to schlep a bulky, jingly jangly, pocket full of keys and other oddly shaped personal items alongside a fixed tool with several implements you will rarely, if ever, use.Stackable - Several of the modules are stackable (we call them mid-modules) meaning you can carry more than one together on a single pocket clip. Both the MOCA II and the NEBA Knife Modules are mid-modules which allows other modules to be stacked on top of them. Mid-modules are easily identified by their machined aluminum scales with the three square holes. The Pocket Flare Mini-Flashlight and WeeLINK Cable Charger are outer modules, which means that they can stack on top of a mid-module but cannot be stacked upon as they form the top or outer most layer.Easily stack Modules w/our no-fastener system - Anywhere Pocket Clip + NEBA Knife + WeeLINK Cable Charger Module = Custom Wearable Multi-Tool
Quick and Easy On / Off - Modules are easily added or removed from the Pocket Clip, Pivot or Slide with our RuSH Module Removal Tool or a heavy-duty paperclip, pen, or other device with a simple point.Removing modules is a snap with the RuSH Module Removal Tool
Wide Range of Uses - There are so many ways to carry Anywhere Tools... on a pocket clip, on multiple pocket clips, dangling from a carabiner, on a keychain, on a backpack, on a purse, with a Keyport Pivot, or with a Keyport Slide 3.0.Stylish - Anywhere Tools provide a cleaner, more personalized, minimalist approach to your everyday carry.Keyport Compatible - All of the modules in this campaign are compatible with both the Keyport Slide 3.0 (sold separately) and the Keyport Pivot. Equal parts modular key organizer + custom multi-tool + exclusive lost & found recovery service all-in-one, Keyport devices complete the ultimate fully customizable everyday carry system.Anywhere Tech and Tool Modules are also compatible with the Keyport Slide 3.0 & Keyport Pivot (sold separately) 
Think of it as a sophisticated alternative to Batman's utility belt... minus the extra 10 pounds, the shiny yellow belt, and the need to wear tights to pull off that whole look.Anywhere Tech Tools are an efficient and much better looking alternative to Batman's utility beltIntegrated Your Valuable Feedback  Like our previous Kickstarter campaigns, we have integrated a great deal of your feedback from our initial set of tools along with feedback on other products in the marketplace to make our latest products stronger, more versatile, and more useful.

With the Pocket Clip attached it is very comfortable to hold with no unpleasant hot spots. The NEBA Knife is also a mid-module, so you can stack other modules or Side Plates on top of it. Pocket Flare™ ModuleAn upgrade from our base mini-flashlight unit, the Pocket Flare is over two times brighter (27 lumens vs. 12 lumens max output) and features lamp mode, a lantern-style light around the entire base of the module to cast a wider light than that of the front beam. We also replaced the slider button with a push button. The Pocket Flare is rechargeable via USB micro, displaying red during charge mode and green when fully charged.
 
WeeLINK™ Charger Cable Module

Everyone these days appears to be carrying multiple charger cables stuffed in their backpack, purse, or even pocket. Yet, as the old saying goes, it feels like there is never one around when you need it most. Enter the WeeLink Charger Cable Module. Available in USB to Micro USB, USB to Lightning, and USB to USB-C, WeeLINK charger cables are easily accessible to keep all of your most important devices powered up.
Available charging connector options for all kinds of phones, tablets, and other rechargeable tech.

 
ParaPull
Alongside the Anywhere Pocket Clip, we designed two products that work in concert to complement the system.
The ParaPull is a short paracord zipper pull style lanyard that makes it easy to pull your Pocket Clip out when you need to get a handle on it.  The ParaPull works equally well connecting loose items to either a Pivot or a Slide.


 
RuSH Multi-Purpose Tool
Remove / Screw / Hang - The RuSH Multi-Purpose Tool makes removing modules, particularly stacked modules, a piece of cake. The RuSH Tool doubles as a suspension clip and features a bottle opener and flathead screwdriver to tighten / loosen the Pivot screw. In addition, the RuSH Tool can be stowed in a Pivot without having to disassemble it.


 
Perks

 

We are going to use BackerKit to administrate the fulfillment process after the campaign. Once we migrate to BackerKit, we will send you out a survey that will help us to review and break down your pledge into the specific rewards you ordered along with their associated costs.


Tentative Schedule

April & May - Integrate consumer feedback, finalize design for manufacturing, finalize quotes (4 weeks)
May 20 thru 31 - Place tooling and production p.o.’s
June & July - Complete production tooling, first shots (8 weeks)
August - Initiate pilot runs of each product, initial beta testing, assuming production tweaks are minor, move ahead with production runs (4 weeks)
September - Production runs (6 weeks)
October - Final QC, package, and ship to backers (2 weeks)

<h2><strong>THE REALITY (TV):</strong></h2>
<p>Winning runner-up on the popular Lifetime reality series ""PROJECT RUNWAY"" Season 11, was the chance of a lifetime opportunity. The experience was invaluable, the exposure was priceless, the accomplishment of being the first Native American Designer to appear on the show was history making, but there was no consolation prize. The monetary compensation for appearing on the show and coming in second place was $0. This is where I need your help!</p>
<h2><strong>""MAKE IT WORK!"" </strong></h2>
<p>This truly is a make it work moment for me, my PM Waterlily Label, and my team. The goal of raising $49,000 will be used as the seed money to help allow my company to blossom. So much goes into production, manufacturing and putting on a runway show, and this amount will just begin to cover an extremely expensive endeavor. The plan is in place, all I need is your cooperation. This next collection is crucial to the growth and future of PMW. $49K in 49 days seems like an incredible request, but we feel that if Indian Country gets involved, Project Runway fans get the word out and PM Waterlily clients continue to support us, we can achieve this together. To Natives, a ""49"" is a celebration or impromptu party after a gathering or powwow, it is spread word of mouth and usually spontaneous in spirit. We intend to throw fundraising events throughout the campaign to share in the experience and bring the community together. Be part of history! </p>

<h2><strong>THE COLLECTION</strong></h2>
<p>The PM Waterlily Label is constantly evolving while maintaining the original essence of what makes it so unique. This new collection is once again eco-friendly, in tune with Mother Earth, inspired by and conscience of protecting it. We are entrusted to take care of the environment for future generations, and this is the central driving force behind the PMW design process; from the fabrication, to algae plant-based dyes, locally sourced fibers. The textile printing and hand-painted methods, cuts of material, draping, and minimal machine work, all contribute to reducing waste and creating a sense of balance. This ready-to-wear line will have a more structured silhouette, lots of mix and match pieces in a variety of fabrics that will take you from day to evening wear, and affordable pricing. The majority of the garments will range from $50-$350. Of course there will be some of the luxe, avant-garde showstoppers, but all of these pieces are designed to flatter each other, offer effortless elegance and compliment your style personality. Feel free to dress it up or down, layer or go for a relaxed minimalistic look.</p>

<h3><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></h3>
<p>My given Taos Pueblo name is Waterlily. For my people, from murky waters, a Waterlily survives. This reflects my life view which is one that embraces endurance. My idea of “green” is really blue. Water can be wild; it can be gentle. Water is not life-giving; it is life itself. My clothing designs are timeless and fluid, capturing this dual nature of water.</p>
<p>I create highly individualized pieces that are elegant, sophisticated and organic by fusing my own aesthetic with indigenous and European perspectives.</p>
<p>The detail of every garment, from hand-painted silk feathers, and meshed leather to textures that echo the natural world, I evoke my own history and culture as part of a larger timeless narrative.</p>
<p>Each design tells a story. Just as a river is pierced by a tree branch, time is momentarily anchored within the garment. Each piece is created, is worn, and continues to create fresh new meanings into the future. Every person brings his or her own sense of self into the narrative and enriches the meaning. In this way, we might defy the consumerist sense of fashion as something we can put on, take off, and casually cast aside.</p>
<h3><strong>HERSTORY</strong></h3>
<p>As the first Native American to appear on <em>Project Runway</em>, it was my mission to ensure that our history and culture are seen through my designs, infusing them with elements from the world around us. Though my aesthetic is not present in the mainstream media, I do want to change the way Native Americans are perceived and portrayed. More than anything I want to be a successful contemporary fashion and textile designer.</p>
<p>I auditioned in 2012 for <em>Project Runway’s</em> Season 11 at the encouragement of the show’s producers who were familiar with my work. After hundreds of questions, essays and photo submissions, I was selected as one of 16 fashion designers from across the United States and abroad, competing for the top spot on the Lifetime hit show that debuted on January 24<sup>th</sup>, 2013.</p>
<p>My original perspective and talent for textile manipulation, made me a stand out in the competition. No one was doing what I was doing, at times it wasn’t understood or accepted. My designs are abstract, not literal, because they are interpretations. All of my garments have meaning behind them; they come from a very old culture but I bring them into a very contemporary realm. The ability to create a garment from the draping and patterning to the fabrication and design, carried me through the season and in the end helped me claim the runner-up title. The advice and guidance from the Judges; Heidi Klum, Zac Posen, Nina Garcia, Michael Kors and mentor, Tim Gunn, were invaluable to me and I will be forever grateful for the experience. I wanted to represent our People well, to show off the beauty and talents we have to offer without forgetting who I am and where I come from. I believe I achieved this and hope to continue to make my family, friends, Pueblo, all Native Tribes and people at large around me proud, with a strong voice and an honest dialogue of what we believe in.</p>

<h3><strong>EMERGENCE &amp; BLOOM</strong></h3>
<p>Our Project PM Waterlily: Funding Fashion Week Plan is to pull enough resources to execute, produce and manufacture the next collection(s) for Fashion Week. Our goal is to raise a total of $49K. Plans are already set in place to be a presence during both Santa Fe Fashion Week in Oct. 2013 and NYFW in 2014, displaying our Spring &amp; Fall Collections. This incredible task takes a lot of work from many people and this is where we need your assistance. You, our contributors, are seen as investors. We want to provide only the best ready-to-wear garments, accessories and art merchandise possible. In order to maintain this high level of quality and unique vision, we are forced to expand the company. This growth will be initiated in hiring new staff, training interns, paying photographers, purchasing new up to date equipment, employing the latest textile and fabric design technology, raising funds for full-time PR representation, allotting monies for business related transportation needs, travel, lodging, marketing, social media presence, advertisement, webpage maintenance, textile development, printing options, seamstresses, pattern makers, new bust forms, sewing machines, keeping up with the costs of running the studio, attaining a reserve for models, hair/makeup and so much more. If you believe in this dream as we do, please consider donating to this campaign.</p>
<h3><strong>PM WATERLILY IS INTERNATIONAL</strong></h3>
<p>Without funding, PM Waterlily has already attained a global presence. But with your contribution, we can take this company to the next level. I feel that this a huge turning point in my career, and now is the time to put all of my years of hard work, experience and know-how to good use. To give a brief history of what is possible, I've jotted down some of my adventures, travels and accomplishments -</p>
<p>My memories of playing among giant stacks of Navajo rugs in my mother’s gallery in Santa Fe, were actually the first contact and connection I had with the rich, brilliant heritage of Native American textiles. Following my desire to create fabric and textile art, I was drawn to the world of couture fashion. My career spans almost 30 years, starting with the Institute of American Indian Arts, where I studied graphic design, jewelry and traditional techniques. This experience led to an internship with the Santa Fe Opera working in the Wardrobe Department. Later while attending The Chicago Art Institute, I worked at the Field Museum and an art gallery. A passion for tailoring, design and craftsmanship brought me to Milan, Italy, where I apprenticed with Tailor Bruno. In Italy, fashion is considered an art form unto itself and honing one’s craft is highly respected. I standby and share this belief to this very day, fashion is art!</p>
<p>My next move was to the “Fashion Capitol of the World”, New York City. I applied my knowledge of art, fashion, and textile design to create some of my first samples and collaborations with Cindy Mak, who was located in the heart of the garment district. This relationship produced my first collection that was showcased at Fashion Week. With the help of “UNRESERVED” American Indian Arts &amp; Fashion Alliance, I became the first and only Native Fashion Label to show at the prestigious New York Fashion Week at Bryant Park. <em>Project Runway</em> presented me with the opportunity to accomplish another unprecedented feat; first Native American Designer to participate in Mercedes-Benz New York Fashion Week in The Tents at Lincoln Center.</p>
<p>Other career highs include working with the W.K. Kellogg Foundation as the assistant director for two international cultural exchange shows that promoted Native American and South African fashion designers and artists. I showed in both the Santa Fe Indian Market cultural fashion show and the Johannesburg, South African runway show. I was also selected as a featured artist for the Aboriginal Awards Festival and showed at Toronto Fashion Week. After launching my first line of eco-friendly clothing at BODY of Santa Fe and being part of the “Art To Wear” exhibit at the Wheelwright Museum, I was asked to participate in New Zealand’s world-renown Maori Art Market Fashion Show in Wellington, NZ. Upon returning to New Mexico, I was chosen as one of the featured Native American Designers at Buffalo Thunder Resort’s first annual fashion event which later became Santa Fe Fashion Week. SWAIA’s Annual Indian Market then awarded me with several prestigious awards including Best of Classification in Textiles (a unanimous vote; an unbelievable first for a modern garment or textile) a First Place in Garments and First Place in Contemporary Fashion &amp; Accessories. Recently, I was honored to be named as one of the “Remarkable Women of Taos” and received a Letter of Recognition of Accomplishments from the New Mexico State Senator’s Office.</p>
<p>All of this happened because others believed in me and my vision. It is just the beginning and more is just around the corner. By giving to this campaign you will be reserving a spot for a Native American perspective in the mainstream fashion world and create future opportunities for upcoming NA Designers. You will also ensure the continuum of a rich culture, beliefs and art through your generous act of donating.</p>

<h3><strong>THE PMW IMPACT</strong></h3>
<p>What I understand is that tradition and modernity combined, can move forward the dynamic and creative cultures of Native Peoples. As far as my creative process is concerned, I realize that I don’t own traditional culture; I am just fortunate enough to participate in it. The pure enjoyment and love I feel through my participation – combined with my global travels – has helped me create the different forms, shapes, cuts, textures, and subtle imagery of my designs. My commitment to both fashion and heritage has led me to walk many creative paths. I want you to join me on this continued journey.</p>
<p>By sharing this information and campaign address with your family, friends, acquaintances, co-workers, on social networking sites, blogs, forums, and at similar events or community gatherings, you can be one of the seeds that help grow this new company. Any contribution is appreciated, even as small as one dollar, because it all adds up in the end. A great many people together with a united goal can make any dream possible. All of the milestones that I’ve experience in last few years were not achieved on my own. I had a group of people who believed in my work, collaborated with me, donated their time and resources and now you can be acknowledged as part of my team.</p>
<p>Since I was young, I was told that when we leave our village, we represent our people so when we return home we should make them proud. I was taught by the women in my family to walk in grace and that the women from Taos Pueblo are strong but gentle – we have nothing to prove, just that we take care of our family, ourselves, and our culture. This dream is my way of giving back to the community, to give a voice to my People. I have always aimed to raise awareness for NA Causes, Schools. Scholarships &amp; Non-Profits. I have donated my time, energy and clothing to help benefit at-risk youth, NA Organizations and Art Programs. My ultimate hope is that I will be able to open doors for other aspiring designers and artists, give them as sense of confidence and have our shared legacy live on.</p>

Of course there will be some of the luxe, avant-garde showstoppers, but all of these pieces are designed to flatter each other, offer effortless elegance and compliment your style personality. Feel free to dress it up or down, layer or go for a relaxed minimalistic look.

INTRODUCTION
My given Taos Pueblo name is Waterlily. For my people, from murky waters, a Waterlily survives. This reflects my life view which is one that embraces endurance. My idea of “green” is really blue. Water can be wild; it can be gentle. Water is not life-giving; it is life itself. My clothing designs are timeless and fluid, capturing this dual nature of water.
I create highly individualized pieces that are elegant, sophisticated and organic by fusing my own aesthetic with indigenous and European perspectives.
The detail of every garment, from hand-painted silk feathers, and meshed leather to textures that echo the natural world, I evoke my own history and culture as part of a larger timeless narrative.
Each design tells a story. Just as a river is pierced by a tree branch, time is momentarily anchored within the garment. Each piece is created, is worn, and continues to create fresh new meanings into the future. Every person brings his or her own sense of self into the narrative and enriches the meaning. In this way, we might defy the consumerist sense of fashion as something we can put on, take off, and casually cast aside.
HERSTORY
As the first Native American to appear on Project Runway, it was my mission to ensure that our history and culture are seen through my designs, infusing them with elements from the world around us. Though my aesthetic is not present in the mainstream media, I do want to change the way Native Americans are perceived and portrayed. More than anything I want to be a successful contemporary fashion and textile designer.
I auditioned in 2012 for Project Runway’s Season 11 at the encouragement of the show’s producers who were familiar with my work. After hundreds of questions, essays and photo submissions, I was selected as one of 16 fashion designers from across the United States and abroad, competing for the top spot on the Lifetime hit show that debuted on January 24th, 2013.
My original perspective and talent for textile manipulation, made me a stand out in the competition. No one was doing what I was doing, at times it wasn’t understood or accepted. My designs are abstract, not literal, because they are interpretations. All of my garments have meaning behind them; they come from a very old culture but I bring them into a very contemporary realm. The ability to create a garment from the draping and patterning to the fabrication and design, carried me through the season and in the end helped me claim the runner-up title. The advice and guidance from the Judges; Heidi Klum, Zac Posen, Nina Garcia, Michael Kors and mentor, Tim Gunn, were invaluable to me and I will be forever grateful for the experience. I wanted to represent our People well, to show off the beauty and talents we have to offer without forgetting who I am and where I come from. I believe I achieved this and hope to continue to make my family, friends, Pueblo, all Native Tribes and people at large around me proud, with a strong voice and an honest dialogue of what we believe in.

EMERGENCE & BLOOM
Our Project PM Waterlily: Funding Fashion Week Plan is to pull enough resources to execute, produce and manufacture the next collection(s) for Fashion Week. Our goal is to raise a total of $49K. Plans are already set in place to be a presence during both Santa Fe Fashion Week in Oct. 2013 and NYFW in 2014, displaying our Spring & Fall Collections. This incredible task takes a lot of work from many people and this is where we need your assistance. You, our contributors, are seen as investors. We want to provide only the best ready-to-wear garments, accessories and art merchandise possible. In order to maintain this high level of quality and unique vision, we are forced to expand the company. This growth will be initiated in hiring new staff, training interns, paying photographers, purchasing new up to date equipment, employing the latest textile and fabric design technology, raising funds for full-time PR representation, allotting monies for business related transportation needs, travel, lodging, marketing, social media presence, advertisement, webpage maintenance, textile development, printing options, seamstresses, pattern makers, new bust forms, sewing machines, keeping up with the costs of running the studio, attaining a reserve for models, hair/makeup and so much more. If you believe in this dream as we do, please consider donating to this campaign.
PM WATERLILY IS INTERNATIONAL
Without funding, PM Waterlily has already attained a global presence. But with your contribution, we can take this company to the next level. I feel that this a huge turning point in my career, and now is the time to put all of my years of hard work, experience and know-how to good use. To give a brief history of what is possible, I've jotted down some of my adventures, travels and accomplishments -
My memories of playing among giant stacks of Navajo rugs in my mother’s gallery in Santa Fe, were actually the first contact and connection I had with the rich, brilliant heritage of Native American textiles. Following my desire to create fabric and textile art, I was drawn to the world of couture fashion. My career spans almost 30 years, starting with the Institute of American Indian Arts, where I studied graphic design, jewelry and traditional techniques. This experience led to an internship with the Santa Fe Opera working in the Wardrobe Department. Later while attending The Chicago Art Institute, I worked at the Field Museum and an art gallery. A passion for tailoring, design and craftsmanship brought me to Milan, Italy, where I apprenticed with Tailor Bruno. In Italy, fashion is considered an art form unto itself and honing one’s craft is highly respected. I standby and share this belief to this very day, fashion is art!
My next move was to the “Fashion Capitol of the World”, New York City. I applied my knowledge of art, fashion, and textile design to create some of my first samples and collaborations with Cindy Mak, who was located in the heart of the garment district. This relationship produced my first collection that was showcased at Fashion Week. With the help of “UNRESERVED” American Indian Arts & Fashion Alliance, I became the first and only Native Fashion Label to show at the prestigious New York Fashion Week at Bryant Park. Project Runway presented me with the opportunity to accomplish another unprecedented feat; first Native American Designer to participate in Mercedes-Benz New York Fashion Week in The Tents at Lincoln Center.
Other career highs include working with the W.K. Kellogg Foundation as the assistant director for two international cultural exchange shows that promoted Native American and South African fashion designers and artists. I showed in both the Santa Fe Indian Market cultural fashion show and the Johannesburg, South African runway show. I was also selected as a featured artist for the Aboriginal Awards Festival and showed at Toronto Fashion Week. After launching my first line of eco-friendly clothing at BODY of Santa Fe and being part of the “Art To Wear” exhibit at the Wheelwright Museum, I was asked to participate in New Zealand’s world-renown Maori Art Market Fashion Show in Wellington, NZ. Upon returning to New Mexico, I was chosen as one of the featured Native American Designers at Buffalo Thunder Resort’s first annual fashion event which later became Santa Fe Fashion Week. SWAIA’s Annual Indian Market then awarded me with several prestigious awards including Best of Classification in Textiles (a unanimous vote; an unbelievable first for a modern garment or textile) a First Place in Garments and First Place in Contemporary Fashion & Accessories. Recently, I was honored to be named as one of the “Remarkable Women of Taos” and received a Letter of Recognition of Accomplishments from the New Mexico State Senator’s Office.
All of this happened because others believed in me and my vision. It is just the beginning and more is just around the corner. By giving to this campaign you will be reserving a spot for a Native American perspective in the mainstream fashion world and create future opportunities for upcoming NA Designers. You will also ensure the continuum of a rich culture, beliefs and art through your generous act of donating.

THE PMW IMPACT
What I understand is that tradition and modernity combined, can move forward the dynamic and creative cultures of Native Peoples. As far as my creative process is concerned, I realize that I don’t own traditional culture; I am just fortunate enough to participate in it. The pure enjoyment and love I feel through my participation – combined with my global travels – has helped me create the different forms, shapes, cuts, textures, and subtle imagery of my designs. My commitment to both fashion and heritage has led me to walk many creative paths. I want you to join me on this continued journey.
By sharing this information and campaign address with your family, friends, acquaintances, co-workers, on social networking sites, blogs, forums, and at similar events or community gatherings, you can be one of the seeds that help grow this new company. Any contribution is appreciated, even as small as one dollar, because it all adds up in the end. A great many people together with a united goal can make any dream possible. All of the milestones that I’ve experience in last few years were not achieved on my own. I had a group of people who believed in my work, collaborated with me, donated their time and resources and now you can be acknowledged as part of my team.
Since I was young, I was told that when we leave our village, we represent our people so when we return home we should make them proud. I was taught by the women in my family to walk in grace and that the women from Taos Pueblo are strong but gentle – we have nothing to prove, just that we take care of our family, ourselves, and our culture. This dream is my way of giving back to the community, to give a voice to my People. I have always aimed to raise awareness for NA Causes, Schools. Scholarships & Non-Profits. I have donated my time, energy and clothing to help benefit at-risk youth, NA Organizations and Art Programs. My ultimate hope is that I will be able to open doors for other aspiring designers and artists, give them as sense of confidence and have our shared legacy live on.

If you selected one or more of the above, you have been deemed “a

Hello Likely Liker! I'm Emily. I make earrings out of recycled bike tubes. They are all the rage amongst people I know and a stylish TSA officer at PDX. These are the eco-chic results of me having my way with a flat tire graveyard:My earrings attracted the attention of Ashira & Andy, co-founders of Salila Rising, a new, fair trade fashion
line from India that empowers formerly trafficked girls and women by providing safe, meaningful, dignified work and economic opportunity. These are some of the women of Salila Rising:You can read more about why you'll feel good in supporting Salila Rising but since this is the ""Short Summary"" part of my campaign, I'll get straight to the good stuff:What the young women of Salila Rising need most (beyond the shelter and rehabilitation they get through STOP India) is simple. They need two things:

Skills trainings that help them create opportunities for financial independence


Occasions to have fun, be loved and feel seen 

This is where our stories and lives converge: yours, mine and theirs.

In June, I am traveling to New Delhi, India to lead a 2-Day Skills Training for the young women of Salila Rising. Together, we are going to design an exclusive, limited-edition ""India Collection"" of earrings created especially for YOU, our beloved Indiegogo supporters! How's that for an all-around feel-good fest?!



WHERE DOES THE MONEY GO?

Travel: $1,700 (roundtrip airfare, passport renewal and ground transportation)


Materials: $300 (includes supplies to be left with Salila Rising)


Payment: $600 (payment to Salila Rising for earrings created for this campaign)


Campaign Fees: $600 (IndieGoGo and merchant fees, plus perk fulfillment)



WHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU?


Sweet eco-friendly accessories


Warm, fuzzy feelings 


An opportunity to directly better the quality of life for 8-10 women who represent our world's most oppressed, vulnerable and under-resourced population without having to lift a finger (ok, ok, you WILL have to wiggle a few around while you select your perk but that'll hardly break a sweat!)

It is finer than typical cashmere and Egyptian cotton and warmer than wool. In addition to the soft texture, this material is also anti-pilling and heat retaining. It’s ultra-thin that can keep you warm and not destroy your fashion look.

 
 

 
Miyabi™, also known as heat-generating textile, is developed by MITSUBISHI Chemical in pursuit of thermal comfort and a smoother texture.

 
Existing fibers used for cold weather that simply insulate with its big bulk. They do not actually create heat to the body.
 
Miyabi™ is a perfectly new fiber based on a different design concept. It generates heat. It absorbs water quickly and keeps you dry and comfortable.

<p align=""justify""><b>VienneMilano Luxury Hosiery</b> is the first luxury hosiery brand dedicated to thigh-high stockings. We started in 2011 with a dream: to reintroduce luxury hosiery to the USA to help every woman feel and be fabulous.</p>
<p align=""justify"">In the past few years, we have learned many lessons. We came to the hosiery industry as outsiders, but with great passion and lots of work, we now know the trade: from where to source the best materials, yarns, lace, silicone bands, etc., to which manufacturers can deliver great quality, to how to design fabulous packaging. We are tested and ready.</p><p></p>

<p align=""center""><b>What are Thigh Highs? </b></p>
<p align=""justify"">""Thigh-High Stockings"" or simply ""Thigh Highs"", and for those across the pond simply ""Stockings"" or sometimes ""Stay Ups"",  are hosiery pieces held in place by a band. Unlike grandma's pantyhose, thigh highs go up to the thigh, not to the waist. </p>
<p align=""center""><b>How are the Permanent, Signature, and Basics Collections Different?</b></p>
<p align=""justify"">VienneMilano's Permanent Collection includes pieces (currently six) which have consistently been our customers' favorites and our best sellers. Permanent Collection pieces are available every year, in every season, and are normally priced at $29.95 per pair. (You can get 50% off or more by pre-ordering during this Indiegogo campaign, check out the Perks.) </p>
<p align=""justify"">Every year, VienneMilano presents a Signature Collection: a few more fashion-forward, eccentric, and often colorful pieces. Signature Collection pieces are normally one-offs (buy them before they are gone!) and priced from $29.95 up to  $69.95 or more for paticularly elaborate pieces, such as our Limited Edition Ottavia Lace from the Signature 2011 Collection.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Should we reach the $40K stretch goal, VienneMilano will also design and produce a Basics Collection: very good quality pieces, for everyday use by every woman, at a very 
affordable price. Our initial target is to offer two pieces (one 
black, one nude) at $9.95 per pair. The Basics 
Collection pieces may have smaller lace on the bands and use forego some
 of the embellishments, but will still feature all the details (silicone
 bands, premium yarns, etc.) that make VienneMilano fabulous. <br/></p>

<p align=""justify"">VienneMilano is a small American business, so our natural inclination would be to source our products in the USA. However, for hosiery and indeed all things fashion, Italy is the world's capital: the best materials, the finest craftsmanship, and the greatest experience is there. And we want to bring the best to our customers, without compromise or borders. Plus, Italy is forever romantic and oh-so-fabulous! You can join us there with the Fashionista: Fly to Italy perk. </p>
<p align=""center""><b>Why Thigh Highs Are Much Better than Pantyhose?</b></p>
<p align=""justify"">Compared to pantyhose, thigh highs are much more comfortable, more fitted, more sanitary, and obviously much sexier. Thigh highs go up to the thigh, not to the waist: as such, they do not flatten your curves under fitted skirts, dresses or pants. Furthermore, thigh highs allow you to choose whether to hide, reveal, or hint at their lacy band. You are in control, and will feel fabulous in every occasion.</p>
<p align=""center""><b>Do Thigh Highs Need a Garter Belt?</b></p>
<p align=""justify"">No. VienneMilano stockings feature silicone bands that will hold them in place without the need of a garter belt. But of course, if you wish to create a more alluring and intimate style, you can certainly add a garter belt. The garter will not be needed to help with VienneMilano stockings, but who knows, it may help with love!</p>

<p align=""center""><b>Why the Silicone Band?</b></p>
<p align=""justify"">Some low-quality thigh highs use elastics and have a tendency to fall down at the most inopportune moment... Not so with VienneMilano: our thigh highs are securely held in place by silicone bands. When worn properly all the way up to the upper thigh, VienneMilano stockings will stay up, all day, and all night.<br/><br/>
</p>
<p align=""center""><b>Are VienneMilano Stockings Really Hypo-Allergenic?</b></p>
<p align=""justify"">Yes. We have selected some of the very best manufacturers in the industry, and their production process is state-of-the-art. For the technically inclined, our bands are covered by the OEKO-TEX Standard 100 certificate and comply with the very strict Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) legislation (XVII) of the European Union.</p>
<p align=""center""><b>How is VienneMilano's Gift Box Totally Fabulous?</b></p>
<p align=""justify"">Because it totally is! But don't take our word for it... take a look at this Unboxing Video created by one of our fans. <br/></p>

<p align=""center""><b>What Can I Wear Thigh Highs With?</b></p>
<p align=""justify"">VienneMilano hosiery can enhance just about any outfit, be it casual, formal, or fun. Try wearing thigh highs with a dress or a skirt suit, and you may fall in love. Try wearing them with lingerie or ... nothing, and that special someone will definitely fall in love, too. </p>
<p align=""justify"">Also, when we reach the $130K stretch goal, our founder Vienne will start penning a fabulous style guide, which will be published in both hard-cover paper and digital editions, and will showcase many fashion-forward, creative ways to add a little VienneMilano fabulous sass to your outfits.</p>

<p align=""center""><b>Can I Wear Thigh Highs with Pants?</b></p>
<p align=""justify"">Of course! Thigh highs under pants can be a little secret: they will keep you warmer in the winter, help you show off your curves under skinny pants, and make for a very nice, unexpected surprise for that special someone.</p>
<p align=""center""><b>Which Shoes Look Best with Thigh Highs?</b></p>
<p align=""justify"">In general we suggest pairing thigh highs with closed-toe shoes. However, some of our hosiery is designed with an invisible toe, and will work with your favorite open-toe shoes. By backing our campaign (especially if you select the  Become a Designer, Fashionista: Fly to Boston, and Fashionista: Fly to Italy) you can help us design hosiery just like you want it, including more pieces with invisible toe. <br/></p>

<p align=""center""><b>How to Take Care of Thigh Highs?</b></p>
<p align=""justify"">Always be gentle when putting on or taking off your thigh highs. Removing any jewelry which can get in the way and making sure your finger and toe nails are smooth (treat yourself to that mani/pedi...) will also protect your thigh-high stockings from runs and holes. You can also increase the life of your hosiery by storing it properly (for example, in our VienneMilano's Fab Gift Box).</p>
<p align=""center""><b>How to Wash Thigh Highs?</b></p>
<p align=""justify"">Cheap hosiery is a disposable, one-night-stand affair. Bad for the environment, bad for your legs. Instead, VienneMilano stockings are durable and can be washed and reused many times.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Gently wash your VienneMilano hosiery either by hand (recommended) or in the washing machine in a garment bag. If by hand, soak in mildly soap, lukewarm water, then rinse until you have removed any soap. If with the washing machine, use the delicate setting with cold water only. </p>
<p align=""justify"">After washing, lay thigh highs flat (on a towel, for example) to air dry. Do not hang your thigh highs, and whatever you do, never tumble dry, ever.</p>
<p align=""center""><b>Oh! They Ripped. Now What?</b></p>
<p align=""justify"">Only true love can last forever, but VienneMilano thigh highs can last a very long time, especially if properly care for. That said, bad luck happens and all thigh highs may rip. When it's time, it's time: buy another pair or two! <br/><br/></p>

<p align=""center""><b>How to Choose Style(s) and Size on Pre-Orders?</b></p>
<p align=""justify"">In August, upon receipt of the products from our manufacturers in Italy, all backers who pre-ordered hosiery will receive via email (at the email address used to participate in the Indiegogo campaign) a link to select their style(s) and size, update their mailing address if necessary, and dispatch their pre-order, and more.</p>
<p align=""center""><b>When Will Pre-Orders Ship?</b></p>
<p align=""justify"">Upon completion of the Indiegogo campaign, we will work with you (especially if you have chosen the Become a Designer perk) to finalize the design for VienneMilano's 2016 Signature Collection. We then expect to place orders in late May and to receive products by late July. We then expect to ship pre-orders placed during the initial campaign (i.e. by May 7, 2016) before the end of August and pre-orders placed during the InDemand period (i.e. on or after May 8, 2016) by the end of September 2016.<br/></p>
<p align=""center""><b>Will Pre-Orders Ship Free?</b></p>
<p align=""justify"">Yes, if your selected delivery address is within the USA. For deliveries to the EU, we charge a flat fee of $10 per delivery. For deliveries to the rest of the world, we charge a flat fee of $30 per delivery. Should we reach the Loving Europe stretch goal, we will rebate the delivery fee to the EU down to zero and offer free shipping to both the USA and EU. <br/></p>
<p align=""center""><b>Will Pre-Orders Ship Worldwide?</b></p>
<p align=""justify"">Yes. All orders to the US and EU will ship DDP (Delivered Duty Paid), i.e. to your doorstep. All other international orders will ship DDU (Delivered Duty Unpaid.) This means that we are responsible for shipping charges and insurance up to the agreed-upon destination. You are instead responsible for additional local transportation (if needed) beyond the port-of-entry and for all local custom clearance, customs tariffs, duties, and fees, and similar.</p>
<p align=""center""><b>Will You Accept Returns on Pre-Orders?</b></p>
<p align=""justify"">No. Our manufacturing run will be based on the results of the Indiegogo campaign, and all pre-orders and perk purchases are considered final and non-refundable. But they make for fabulous gifts!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1459134540/ol1oq9c5lwophetrdr1l.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p align=""center""><b>What is Ottavia Lace?</b></p>
<p align=""justify"">Ottavia Lace is a vintage piece from VienneMilano's first Signature Collection, initially presented in 2011. Our supplies of Ottavia are now extremely limited, and we are offering them as a treat for our Indiegogo backers.</p>
<p align=""justify"">Ottavia is a very unique piece, a truly luxurious product for the most special of occasions. Hosiery is normally woven out of artificial fibers such as spandex and nylon on circular knitting machines. Instead, Ottavia is entirely made of the finest hand-stitched, rolled, cotton Italian lace, from toe to thigh. You can see some photos of our models with Ottavia in the Gallery. <br/></p>
<p align=""center""><b>What is the Deal for Fashionista: Fly to Boston?</b></p>
<p align=""justify"">With the Fashionista: Fly to Boston, you will acquire the opportunity to collaborate with our founder Vienne and with our fashionistas to design and name some of the pieces in our 2017 Signature Collection. We will fly you to Boston (from anywhere in the world) for a three-day design workshop, which we expect to take place in late October or early November 2016. We will also host you in a lovely, luxury  accommodation for two nights. <br/></p>
<p align=""justify"">Here's a few extra things to keep in mind: 1) We will pay for one ticket, in economy class, using a major airline of our choice. If you wish to fly business or first class, or bring a friend or significant other, or use another airline of your preference, you will have to pay for the extra costs yourself. 2) If you will be flying in from outside the USA, you will be responsible for complying with US immigration law. We cannot and will not offer legal advice on how to pursue a US visa. 3) We will do our best to accommodate everyone's schedule with ample advance notice. However, should you be unable to participate in the workshop due to scheduling issues, immigration issues, or other reasons, the perk purchase is non-refundable.  <br/></p>

<p align=""justify"">With the Fashionista: Fly to Italy, you will acquire the opportunity to collaborate with our founder Vienne and with our fashionistas to design and name some of the pieces in our 2017 Signature Collection. We will fly you to Milan, Italy (from anywhere in the world) for a four-day stay, including a two-day design workshop and a visit to our manufacturers. We expect the trip to take place in the late Spring of 2017, tentatively in April or May 2017. We will also host you in a lovely, luxury accommodation for three nights. <br/></p>

</div></div>","VienneMilano Luxury Hosiery is the first luxury hosiery brand dedicated to thigh-high stockings. We started in 2011 with a dream: to reintroduce luxury hosiery to the USA to help every woman feel and be fabulous.
In the past few years, we have learned many lessons. We came to the hosiery industry as outsiders, but with great passion and lots of work, we now know the trade: from where to source the best materials, yarns, lace, silicone bands, etc., to which manufacturers can deliver great quality, to how to design fabulous packaging. We are tested and ready.



Now we have come to Indiegogo to seek your help for the big push forward! By backing our campaign, you will empower VienneMilano to offer many more designs, styles and colors; to manufacture the Basics Collection, more affordable for everyday use; to develop color-calibrated photography which reveals just how each piece and color contribute to every woman's beauty, regardless of her skin tone; will publish a style guide; and so much more. And most importantly, you will do your part to help every woman feel and be fabulous.





Thigh-high stockings or simply thigh highs are hosiery pieces held in place by a band. Unlike grandma's pantyhose, thigh highs go up to the thigh, not to the waist.







1. So Sexy.Your legs will look fabulous, and you will feel and be fabulous. And one more secret: with thigh highs, your butt will never look flat.







2. Stay Up, Always. Bands are laced with silicone, not elastics: they will stay up, always, and give you great freedom of movement, all day, and all night.







3. Highest Quality. Hand-crafted in Italy using premium materials: yarns, laces, silicone, etc. Hypo-allergenic, very durable, yet quite affordable.







4. Many Options. With many styles, colors, and thicknesses, you will always find a pair that suits the occasion, time of day (and night!) or weather.







5. Fab Gift Box. First impressions do matter: be it a gift for yourself or your beloved, you totally need a fabulous gift box. We got you covered.







We have fabulous perks available for you, and with VienneMilano thigh highs, you (or your beloved) will look fabulous. But there is more: you  will also do good, and feel good about it, by helping us support 
underprivileged women and spreading the conversation on women equality. 
Here's how:





As a backer, you will receive two of our ""Every Woman is Fabulous"" Pin with every perk. One for you, one to give. Wearing the pin will show your support for equality and empowerment. It will be a great conversation starter for that very important conversation we should all be having.

What are Thigh Highs? 
""Thigh-High Stockings"" or simply ""Thigh Highs"", and for those across the pond simply ""Stockings"" or sometimes ""Stay Ups"",  are hosiery pieces held in place by a band. Unlike grandma's pantyhose, thigh highs go up to the thigh, not to the waist. 
How are the Permanent, Signature, and Basics Collections Different?
VienneMilano's Permanent Collection includes pieces (currently six) which have consistently been our customers' favorites and our best sellers. Permanent Collection pieces are available every year, in every season, and are normally priced at $29.95 per pair. (You can get 50% off or more by pre-ordering during this Indiegogo campaign, check out the Perks.) 
Every year, VienneMilano presents a Signature Collection: a few more fashion-forward, eccentric, and often colorful pieces. Signature Collection pieces are normally one-offs (buy them before they are gone!) and priced from $29.95 up to  $69.95 or more for paticularly elaborate pieces, such as our Limited Edition Ottavia Lace from the Signature 2011 Collection.
Should we reach the $40K stretch goal, VienneMilano will also design and produce a Basics Collection: very good quality pieces, for everyday use by every woman, at a very 
affordable price. Our initial target is to offer two pieces (one 
black, one nude) at $9.95 per pair. The Basics 
Collection pieces may have smaller lace on the bands and use forego some
 of the embellishments, but will still feature all the details (silicone
 bands, premium yarns, etc.) that make VienneMilano fabulous. 
Why are VienneMilano Stockings Made in Italy?
VienneMilano is a small American business, so our natural inclination would be to source our products in the USA. However, for hosiery and indeed all things fashion, Italy is the world's capital: the best materials, the finest craftsmanship, and the greatest experience is there. And we want to bring the best to our customers, without compromise or borders. Plus, Italy is forever romantic and oh-so-fabulous! You can join us there with the Fashionista: Fly to Italy perk. 
Why Thigh Highs Are Much Better than Pantyhose?
Compared to pantyhose, thigh highs are much more comfortable, more fitted, more sanitary, and obviously much sexier. Thigh highs go up to the thigh, not to the waist: as such, they do not flatten your curves under fitted skirts, dresses or pants. Furthermore, thigh highs allow you to choose whether to hide, reveal, or hint at their lacy band. You are in control, and will feel fabulous in every occasion.
Do Thigh Highs Need a Garter Belt?
No. VienneMilano stockings feature silicone bands that will hold them in place without the need of a garter belt. But of course, if you wish to create a more alluring and intimate style, you can certainly add a garter belt. The garter will not be needed to help with VienneMilano stockings, but who knows, it may help with love!




Why the Silicone Band?
Some low-quality thigh highs use elastics and have a tendency to fall down at the most inopportune moment... Not so with VienneMilano: our thigh highs are securely held in place by silicone bands. When worn properly all the way up to the upper thigh, VienneMilano stockings will stay up, all day, and all night.

Are VienneMilano Stockings Really Hypo-Allergenic?
Yes. We have selected some of the very best manufacturers in the industry, and their production process is state-of-the-art. For the technically inclined, our bands are covered by the OEKO-TEX Standard 100 certificate and comply with the very strict Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) legislation (XVII) of the European Union.
How is VienneMilano's Gift Box Totally Fabulous?
Because it totally is! But don't take our word for it... take a look at this Unboxing Video created by one of our fans. 



What Can I Wear Thigh Highs With?
VienneMilano hosiery can enhance just about any outfit, be it casual, formal, or fun. Try wearing thigh highs with a dress or a skirt suit, and you may fall in love. Try wearing them with lingerie or ... nothing, and that special someone will definitely fall in love, too. 
Also, when we reach the $130K stretch goal, our founder Vienne will start penning a fabulous style guide, which will be published in both hard-cover paper and digital editions, and will showcase many fashion-forward, creative ways to add a little VienneMilano fabulous sass to your outfits.


Can I Wear Thigh Highs with Pants?
Of course! Thigh highs under pants can be a little secret: they will keep you warmer in the winter, help you show off your curves under skinny pants, and make for a very nice, unexpected surprise for that special someone.
Which Shoes Look Best with Thigh Highs?
In general we suggest pairing thigh highs with closed-toe shoes. However, some of our hosiery is designed with an invisible toe, and will work with your favorite open-toe shoes. By backing our campaign (especially if you select the  Become a Designer, Fashionista: Fly to Boston, and Fashionista: Fly to Italy) you can help us design hosiery just like you want it, including more pieces with invisible toe. 






How to Take Care of Thigh Highs?
Always be gentle when putting on or taking off your thigh highs. Removing any jewelry which can get in the way and making sure your finger and toe nails are smooth (treat yourself to that mani/pedi...) will also protect your thigh-high stockings from runs and holes. You can also increase the life of your hosiery by storing it properly (for example, in our VienneMilano's Fab Gift Box).
How to Wash Thigh Highs?
Cheap hosiery is a disposable, one-night-stand affair. Bad for the environment, bad for your legs. Instead, VienneMilano stockings are durable and can be washed and reused many times.
Gently wash your VienneMilano hosiery either by hand (recommended) or in the washing machine in a garment bag. If by hand, soak in mildly soap, lukewarm water, then rinse until you have removed any soap. If with the washing machine, use the delicate setting with cold water only. 
After washing, lay thigh highs flat (on a towel, for example) to air dry. Do not hang your thigh highs, and whatever you do, never tumble dry, ever.
Oh! They Ripped. Now What?
Only true love can last forever, but VienneMilano thigh highs can last a very long time, especially if properly care for. That said, bad luck happens and all thigh highs may rip. When it's time, it's time: buy another pair or two! 



If you kept reading this far, you really love all the details. We love you too.






How to Choose Style(s) and Size on Pre-Orders?
In August, upon receipt of the products from our manufacturers in Italy, all backers who pre-ordered hosiery will receive via email (at the email address used to participate in the Indiegogo campaign) a link to select their style(s) and size, update their mailing address if necessary, and dispatch their pre-order, and more.
When Will Pre-Orders Ship?
Upon completion of the Indiegogo campaign, we will work with you (especially if you have chosen the Become a Designer perk) to finalize the design for VienneMilano's 2016 Signature Collection. We then expect to place orders in late May and to receive products by late July. We then expect to ship pre-orders placed during the initial campaign (i.e. by May 7, 2016) before the end of August and pre-orders placed during the InDemand period (i.e. on or after May 8, 2016) by the end of September 2016.
Will Pre-Orders Ship Free?
Yes, if your selected delivery address is within the USA. For deliveries to the EU, we charge a flat fee of $10 per delivery. For deliveries to the rest of the world, we charge a flat fee of $30 per delivery. Should we reach the Loving Europe stretch goal, we will rebate the delivery fee to the EU down to zero and offer free shipping to both the USA and EU. 
Will Pre-Orders Ship Worldwide?
Yes. All orders to the US and EU will ship DDP (Delivered Duty Paid), i.e. to your doorstep. All other international orders will ship DDU (Delivered Duty Unpaid.) This means that we are responsible for shipping charges and insurance up to the agreed-upon destination. You are instead responsible for additional local transportation (if needed) beyond the port-of-entry and for all local custom clearance, customs tariffs, duties, and fees, and similar.
Will You Accept Returns on Pre-Orders?
No. Our manufacturing run will be based on the results of the Indiegogo campaign, and all pre-orders and perk purchases are considered final and non-refundable. But they make for fabulous gifts!

What is Ottavia Lace?
Ottavia Lace is a vintage piece from VienneMilano's first Signature Collection, initially presented in 2011. Our supplies of Ottavia are now extremely limited, and we are offering them as a treat for our Indiegogo backers.
Ottavia is a very unique piece, a truly luxurious product for the most special of occasions. Hosiery is normally woven out of artificial fibers such as spandex and nylon on circular knitting machines. Instead, Ottavia is entirely made of the finest hand-stitched, rolled, cotton Italian lace, from toe to thigh. You can see some photos of our models with Ottavia in the Gallery. 
What is the Deal for Fashionista: Fly to Boston?
With the Fashionista: Fly to Boston, you will acquire the opportunity to collaborate with our founder Vienne and with our fashionistas to design and name some of the pieces in our 2017 Signature Collection. We will fly you to Boston (from anywhere in the world) for a three-day design workshop, which we expect to take place in late October or early November 2016. We will also host you in a lovely, luxury  accommodation for two nights. 
Here's a few extra things to keep in mind: 1) We will pay for one ticket, in economy class, using a major airline of our choice. If you wish to fly business or first class, or bring a friend or significant other, or use another airline of your preference, you will have to pay for the extra costs yourself. 2) If you will be flying in from outside the USA, you will be responsible for complying with US immigration law. We cannot and will not offer legal advice on how to pursue a US visa. 3) We will do our best to accommodate everyone's schedule with ample advance notice. However, should you be unable to participate in the workshop due to scheduling issues, immigration issues, or other reasons, the perk purchase is non-refundable.  
What is the Deal for Fashionista: Fly to Italy?
With the Fashionista: Fly to Italy, you will acquire the opportunity to collaborate with our founder Vienne and with our fashionistas to design and name some of the pieces in our 2017 Signature Collection. We will fly you to Milan, Italy (from anywhere in the world) for a four-day stay, including a two-day design workshop and a visit to our manufacturers. We expect the trip to take place in the late Spring of 2017, tentatively in April or May 2017. We will also host you in a lovely, luxury accommodation for three nights.

$50K: Expanded 2016 Collection
VienneMilano will expand its 2016 Signature Collection to include 3 more pieces, also co-designed with our backers, for a total of 9 Signature Collection pieces.

$100K: Fashion Show Party
VienneMilano will throw a fabulous Fashion Show Party in November 2016 in Boston, to celebrate the success of our Indiegogo campaign and our love for our backers and for every woman. For reference, our Launch Party in November 2011 was held at the InterContinental Boston and was a 500+ people affair with Hollywood Stars, Diplomats, many models, great music, and lots of fun. We could not make this without you: that is why every backer will get a free ticket and you are all invited. 

$130K: Vienne's Fab Guide
Our founder Vienne will collaborate with VienneMilano's fashionistas to write a style guide showcasing how every woman can feel and be fabulous with great hosiery, through many detailed outfits, for many different occasions.

It takes everything that made the previous Jelly Galaxy great, and advance it to a new level.  No matter what is in your playlist, Jelly Doux assure you will love what you hear.After the successful funding on Indiegogo this March, our previous handbuilt product, Jelly Galaxy, has provided us valuable feedback from our customers, as well as insight into the consumer product landscape, and in-depth knowledge about the intricacies of manufacturing and the value of a manufacturing relationship. The Jelly Doux is the next generation of handmade manufacturing, earphones or otherwise, and we have taken all we’ve learned from our past products and experiences and applied those to every aspect of how we designed, developed and manufacture Jelly Doux.--------------------------------------------Design

Earphones have accompanied us very commonly in our daily routine. But not all users can choose an earpieces that fit perfectly, which is a common issue to female and children.

Now, the frustration is finally ended with Jelly Doux.Minimalist and compact design easily fit all ear sizesThe smooth, continuous unibody design created for Jelly Galaxy comes to Jelly Doux.

- OUR STORY -
In 2013 we decided to take what was a small home based label offering outerwear to a limited number of loyal customers and try to turn GEHRICH into a global luxury brand with a difference..... 

A brand that can take a stand against fast-fashion! 
We wanted GEHRICH to be built on sustainable values and offer people the chance to own exceptional quality fashion pieces that are thoughtfully crafted and constructed to stand the test of time. 
Over the past two years we have invested in set-up, our first collection and all required branding but now we need your help! 
Our goal is to engage with our customers, fashion lovers and people that share in our vision and crowdfunding is the perfect platform for this. Raising money to expand GEHRICH is important but equally important is the chance to engage with people, grow our global following and grow awareness of our brand and values. If you believe in our vision and would like to support GEHRICH, please keep reading and check out the fantastic perks we have to offer! 




- WHAT THE MONEY WILL BE USED FOR -
The money we receive will help us....
1. Fulfill fabric orders with our Australian and International suppliers.
2. Pay for production of our AW15 Collection in Australia.
3. Pay for garment trimmings, collection photography and talent.  
4. If we exceed our goals we could use some money to expand our marketing reach and take on opportunities to show our collections at local and international fashion shows.


- SHARING IS CARING -


Your support can help us grow awareness for GEHRICH globally! 
We need to gain attention from potential customers, fashion buyers and retailers worldwide. If you believe in our vision and love our products then you can really make a huge difference just by talking about GEHRICH and sharing our story with friends across your social networks.

I would love to be able to supply to many stores interested in my product. I want to keep expanding my customer base, but at the moment I can not manage making it all by hand. I have designed a new collection of the most comfortable and fashionable ""easy wear"", comprised of a couple different tank tops, dresses, pants, sports bras, rompers, etc. As well as, a couple mens items including loose-fitting pants, shorts and tank tops. I have fine-tuned my patterns to fit and look best on a variety of people, so I can accommodate more body types, which will in turn boost my customer base. This first collection for production will be made from organic cotton, bamboo and/or hemp jersey stretch knits.</p><p style=""margin: 0.0px 0.0px 15.0px 0.0px; font: 16.0px Arial; color: #121a0e;""> I will also be continuing to make handmade garments…including hoodies and jackets. I will be getting unique textiles and fabrics from different small businesses all over the world to use in my custom gear. It is fair trade and still handmade.

Our main focus is to offer people around the globe a different alternative to fast fashion, and still feel good about how they look and feel; knowing they have contributed to a responsible garment through ethical and transparent practices.Your contribution will help us grow as a brand through our marketing and distribution efforts, therefore helping us have a higher impact on the global community. ​Proud Supporters of…

Our Sweaters: 
1. Made from premium fabric: 100% Baby alpaca from Arequipa, Peru. They produce one of the world’s most luxurious fibers that are softer than cashmere, and lighter, warmer, and more durable than wool. 2. Sustainable: This animal fibre is renewable, biodegradable and 100% natural.3. Pesticide free: The lands where the alpacas live are pesticide free. They eat hichu grass (wild wheatgrass that grows in this part of the Andean Region of South America). Since they are pesticide free, this means that the alpacas and the fiber don’t have any type of chemical contamination. The premium result is very fine quality4. Made in Peru: High quality, great workmanship and strict compliance standards. Our Scarves 1. Made in Peru: 100% Peruvian Pima Cotton2. More absorbent and softer than other cottons.3.

I obtained my bachelor’s degree in New York City at the Fashion Institute of Techonology (F.I.T.) with a focus in International Trade and Marketing for the Fashion Industry and received a Master’s degree at Istituto Marangoni in Brand Management in Milan, Italy. I am the Director at HOPE Made in the world LLC (and member of the board), company that was established in the state of Delaware in 2015.  The official US launch was last September 2016.After ten years of working in the industry in both the United States and Colombia, I was presented with an opportunity to develop a business that helps generate jobs, as well as inform people; the result was HOPE.  I have found that there is no better way to lead a professional career than by spreading valuable information that could potentially shape the way we consume.This project has been able to come to life with the financial support of family and friends as well as our awesome team whose commitment and creativity is particularly valued. We also thank our social media followers whose feedback and support is vital in the growth of HOPE. Sara Milanes, Co-founder & Director/Board Member (Bogota, Colombia)Adriana Ceballos, Co-Founder and Branding Director/Board Member (Bogota, Colombia)Juan Manuel Perez, Investor/Board Member (New York, USA)Maria Nella Manzur, Strategy & Sales Consultant/Board Member (Miami, FL,  USA)Brandhaus, Branding Consultant (Bogota, Colombia)A La Rueda Rueda Foundation, (Monteria & Bogota, Colombia)Laura de Gamboa, Art Director (Bogota, ColombiaGabriella Adeline, Designer (Milan, Italy)Juan Fernando Cubillos, Web Developer & Digital Marketing (Bogota, Colombia)Sonia Velasquez, DIP Digital Interactive Productions (Miami, FL, USA)Javier Hidalgo, Crowd funding Consultant (Bogota, Colombia)Verde Fulfillment, Distribution Center in Boise, Idaho (Boise, Idaho, USA)Waka-s (Erick Febres), Manufacturer (Arequipa, Peru) Fashion RevolutionHOPE Made in the world is a proud supporter of the Fashion Revolution not-for-profit company from the UK.Their MISSION: Believe in fashion – an industry which values people, the environment, creativity and profits in equal measure, and it’s everyone’s responsibility to ensure that this happens.WHY TRANSPARENCY MATTERS: They believe transparency is the first step to transform the industry. And it starts with one simple question: Who made my clothes?The situation now: A lot of brands don’t know who makes their clothes, so how are we supposed to make informed purchases?Source: http://fashionrevolution.org/         Child Labor FreeHOPE is on the journey to be certified Child Labor Free; it is a global certification system that can assess a brand's supply chain and certify products and manufacturers as child labor free. Child Labor Free is currently going through the process of becoming a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact, which is the world’s largest corporate sustainability initiative.CLF provides an assessment framework and risk assessment protocol developed by Ernst & Young.At HOPE, we do not support any kind of child labor.                               Other Ways You Can HelpWe are very thankful for your time and help.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Graeme, a young entreprenuer from Liverpool. After graduating from an E-Business degree I have started a number of small investments, but never had an idea as exciting or fun as this one.</p>
<p>Legz/Bumz was a concept developed whilst my wife was working at a printing company, after developing a fun prototype of white ski salopets with a set of provocative girls legs on the front I trialled them in Tignes. The reaction was amazing, I barely passed a person who did not drop a comment and I can tell these will be a real hit with skiers and snowboarders who love the limelight.</p>
<p>At the moment I do not have the funds to bring these into mass production, but after working closely with a snowsports clothing production company of late I have all the expertise needed to bring BUMZ to the mass market.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need at least $6000 to get the initial 100% prototype manufactured and delivered in order to bring these to some retail outlets. The money will also help develop a website to conduct point to point orders if selling through an established outlet does not take off.</p>
<p>If I dont reach my entire goal, the funds will go on developing a small MOQ with an OEM manufacturer to generate a small stock which will be sold on my website. The product will be marketed through a number of giveaways in cult snowsports magazines.</p>
<p>All pledges of £40+ will recieve a set of the originals bums when they are produced, pledges of less will receieve a money off voucher to the sum of their pledge from the BUMZ range.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The impact of this product is seen on day one, if you have a set of these on, you immediatly become the talking point, centre of attention and break the ice with anyone you would like. perfect in the snowy weather!</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If anyone would like to help without funding, expertise in SQL linked web design and Chinese supply chain manufacturing would be useful!</p>

<p><strong>IT ALL BEGAN WITH AN IDEA-TO MAKE FUNCTIONAL CLOTHING FROM SUSTAINABLE FABRICS IN AN ETHICAL WAY</strong></p>
<p>         In 2009 I established my company for clothing design and manufacturing- DeDesign. I began exploring how to pare down garment design, reduce structure to a minimum, and celebrate the purity of simple forms.</p>
<p>        A simple concept for a convertible garment grew into a whole line of fully reversible dresses, which transform in seconds into almost every articles of clothing--from long to short dresses, long to short skirts, from skirt to a dress,from a dress to a top, from a top to a hooded cape.</p>
<p>     I named the garments TRAVALEER, because they embody the concept of travel--traveling along the body, and making a grea  travel piece.</p>
<h3><strong>TRAVALEER ® is now a registered Trade Mark of my convertible garments. </strong></h3>
<p><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/705559/pictures/full/20130314144752-traveleer_logo_sm.png?1363297679"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p><strong>       </strong>The idea of the sustainable multifunctional cloths for travel and leisure has got many supporters.But costumers are asking for different colors and buyers for large stores and small boutiques alike look for more variety in size and color, to satisfy various tastes.</p>
<p>    To make the concept a reality, to create a sustainable brand and bring it to the large market, I need to make the dresses in more than one color and expand the sizes.The dresses are fully developed and ready to go for production. I have established a relationship with manufacturers of fabric and sewing facilities.</p>

</h3>
<h3>
<strong>1. Less-is-more</strong>—our motto and mantra of sustainability- less-is more when we use sustainable and organic fabrics; less-is-more for producing locally rather than importing overseas; less-is-more for making small productions, rather than fast chain fashion; less-is-more for developing mindful designs with less fabric for multifunctional use.</h3>
<h3>
<strong>2. More-for-less</strong>—is what you get for spending on only one piece that transforms into many!  </h3>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/715325/pictures/full/20130320175812-pizap.com13638236539591.jpg?1363827498"" src="""" style="""" title=""More for less ""/></p>
<p><strong>3. Each garment provides you with almost all different articles of clothing</strong>- long/short skirt, long/short dress, skirt-and-top, tops, hooded tops and hooded dresses, capes and hooded capes.</p>
<p><strong>4. Each garment is fully reversible</strong> (with no back side) with two different colors on the two sides, giving you 2 colors of each variation.</p>
<p><strong>5. Season-less</strong>- bare shoulder summer dress transforms into a snug poncho in the fall and hooded cape in the winter.</p>
<p><strong>6. Dress-it-up-or-dress-it-down</strong>- these pieces epitomize this concept quite literary by traveling up and down the body; pull your pencil skirt from work to cocktail dress for happy hour in seconds; wrap your poncho on a cool airplane flight, pull it down into a sleek dress on stepping on the airport!</p>
<p><strong>7. Effortless change</strong>- refer to our videos to see how easy it is to change from one variation to another in any possible place you go. Our models did it on the stage!</p>
<p><strong>8. Comfort fit</strong>- adjustable lengths, styles and sizes in all of the variations that the garments sustain.</p>
<p><strong>8. Soft luxurious fabrics</strong>- I and my assistants have gone out of our way in finding the best fabrics and fabric manufacturers to suite the design of the garments-- bamboo/spandex, cotton/rayon, bamboo/lurex- they are all produced locally and knit to order for the TARVALEER dresses.</p>
<p><strong>10. Wardrobe in a bag</strong>-pack light, safe extra luggage fees for that flight, and have a piece for any occasion for long and short travel in any climate.</p>
<p><strong>LITTLE HISTORY:<span style=""font-size: 1.5em;""><br/></span></strong>       I invested three years into fabric and market research, samples' development and a small run production. I also invested my love and personal funds into this project, with the idea to create a sustainable brand; a brand that is responsive to our changing environment, frequent travels and busy schedules.</p>
<p>        The journey of the TRAVALEER so far has not been an easy one.I am a one woman company and  I don't come from a manufacturing background, but rather from the creative field of art and design. But I wanted to have full control over the manufacturing process of my designs- I wanted to know how and where the fabric was knit, to produce the fabric and the sewing locally and to use organic and sustainable fabrics when possible.</p>
<p>       I found out hands on the hurdles of manufacturing. Since my product involves an industrial technology for the double-faced fabric knitting, as well as the sewing technique, I had to use big manufactories who have the machinery for my production. That means high minimums on fabric orders and sewing quantities. Since I sponsored my project with personal funds this restricted me to ordering only one color of fabric, and negotiating for the smallest possible batch of production that a factory would be willing to make.</p>
<h3><strong>WHY SHOULD YOU SUPPORT THE TRAVALEER?</strong></h3>
<p>      We've been called the dress engineers, for implementing such intricate construction into a flowing design.</p>
<p>      It is true, I spent most of the design development  diligently  constructing each piece according to the body structure and mechanics, so that the pieces could fit when worn in each different variation,  transform effortlessly from one variation to another, and are comfortable to wear in each and every way.</p>
<p>      What we achieved with the help of my pattern makers,graphic designer, my models in countless long fitting sessions, is an amazing product!</p>
<h3>
<strong style=""font-size: 1.17em;""><br/></strong>HOW WILL THE FUNDS BE DISTRIBUTED:</h3>
<p>      If our campaign is fully funded we will have approximately  $ 5000.00  for the production of each one of the 4 dresses.</p>
<p>We will be able to make 300 dresses of each style in 3 different colors.</p>
<p>      2/3 of the funds will be used for fabric, 1/3 for sewing and the rest- for freight and distribution.</p>
<p>     If our campaign is not fully funded, unfortunately we won't be able to venture into manufacturing. But we will use the funds to market the brand and attract investors and buyers for pre-ordering production.</p>

<p class="""" style=""margin-bottom: 20.0pt; line-height: 24.0pt;""><span style='font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: ""Helvetica Neue""; color: #141A0E;'>Just this year, founder Travis switched up his
style and began gravitating toward what he calls the “strong side part” – best
described as the classic gentleman’s side part, a style that has caught on with
today’s young male professionals just like him across the country.</span></p>
<p class="""" style=""margin-bottom: 20.0pt; line-height: 24.0pt;""><span style='font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: ""Helvetica Neue""; color: #141A0E;'>The classic side part is a timeless look, created using one simple tool: the comb. The comb is a basic
tool that has remained mostly unchanged throughout history: a straight piece of
plastic used to style hair. It was time to re-invent the comb, and to give men everywhere
the ability to make sure their hair looks great every single day. He wanted to
provide a sleek look that takes less time to achieve.</span></p>

<p class="""" style=""margin-bottom: 20.0pt; line-height: 24.0pt;""><span style='font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: ""Helvetica Neue""; color: #141A0E;'>After spending hours each week styling his
hair, Travis became frustrated. Travis realized that he was ready and in need for something new. He knew it shouldn’t take so long to achieve
such a simple style - one that had become a staple of his everyday look. From
zigzags in his part to stray hairs messing up his style, he grew impatient each
morning, re-wetting, re-styling, re-parting his hair until he got it right. He
wondered how such a classic, “simple” hairstyle could possibly take so much
time and concentration to achieve.</span></p>
<p class="""" style=""margin-bottom: 20.0pt; line-height: 24.0pt;""><span style='font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: ""Helvetica Neue""; color: #141A0E;'>Then, a light bulb went off: Travis envisioned
a product that would help him easily create their perfect hairstyle and reduce
the amount of time spent each morning styling his hair. Surely, if he felt a
need for this, others would too. And the idea for a spring-loaded, two-comb
tool – soon to be known as<b> <i>The Perfect Part </i></b><i>– </i>was
born in his New York City apartment.</span></p>
<p class="""" style=""margin-bottom: 20.0pt; line-height: 24.0pt;""><span style='font-size: 14.0pt; font-family: ""Helvetica Neue""; color: #141A0E;'>Once the idea was born, it was time to take
action. He knew he was on to something, based on the simple fact that this
product would undoubtedly improve his own life and routine. If it could work
for him, it could do the same for others. So Travis began sketching out
different ways the comb could look, then approached a manufacturer and began
working with their engineer to develop the most durable, high-quality
design. </span></p>

What is it?
The Perfect Part is a durable, stylish comb
that any man can use to create his perfect hairstyle. The design features two
sturdy combs, bound by a spring-loaded lever, so that anyone can quickly
achieve The Perfect Part.
We believe The Perfect Part is
the best comb – the best styling tool – you’ll ever own. Here’s
why:




It’s simple. Just
three easy steps lead you to The Perfect Part: wet it, part it,
comb it and you’re done.


It’s unique. Its
cutting edge design and smooth functionality makes it a must-have for your
daily routine.


It’s convenient.
In fact, it’s small enough to keep in your pocket.


It’s well-made.
The Perfect Part is designed, manufactured and shipped from the
United States.


It’s sharp. The
jointed comb gives you a modern trendsetting design with a sleek finish.


It’s stylish. Using The Perfect Part will
give you a straight, tidy part that’s trendy and fashionable.    





How does it work?
The Perfect Part works in just three easy
steps:
1. Wet it: Wet
your hair.
2. Part it: Place the comb at
the top of your head at the desired location where you would like to part your
hair. Once in place, simply squeeze the finger grips on the tabs and push down
lightly. The fine teeth of the comb will automatically part your hair into a Perfect
Part.
3. Comb it: Pull the comb off
of your head and it will snap back into a traditional comb, which can be easily
used for finishing touches or touch-ups throughout the day.
Why The Perfect Part?
Just this year, founder Travis switched up his
style and began gravitating toward what he calls the “strong side part” – best
described as the classic gentleman’s side part, a style that has caught on with
today’s young male professionals just like him across the country.
The classic side part is a timeless look, created using one simple tool: the comb. The comb is a basic
tool that has remained mostly unchanged throughout history: a straight piece of
plastic used to style hair. It was time to re-invent the comb, and to give men everywhere
the ability to make sure their hair looks great every single day. He wanted to
provide a sleek look that takes less time to achieve.


THE STORY:
After spending hours each week styling his
hair, Travis became frustrated. Travis realized that he was ready and in need for something new. He knew it shouldn’t take so long to achieve
such a simple style - one that had become a staple of his everyday look. From
zigzags in his part to stray hairs messing up his style, he grew impatient each
morning, re-wetting, re-styling, re-parting his hair until he got it right. He
wondered how such a classic, “simple” hairstyle could possibly take so much
time and concentration to achieve.
Then, a light bulb went off: Travis envisioned
a product that would help him easily create their perfect hairstyle and reduce
the amount of time spent each morning styling his hair. Surely, if he felt a
need for this, others would too. And the idea for a spring-loaded, two-comb
tool – soon to be known as The Perfect Part – was
born in his New York City apartment.
Once the idea was born, it was time to take
action. He knew he was on to something, based on the simple fact that this
product would undoubtedly improve his own life and routine. If it could work
for him, it could do the same for others. So Travis began sketching out
different ways the comb could look, then approached a manufacturer and began
working with their engineer to develop the most durable, high-quality
design. 



Why – and how – you should get behind The
Perfect Part:
With our design finalized, we are ready to
begin production, but we need your financial and social resources to
make our project a success. In order for The Perfect
Part to be successful, we need to raise enough financial capital –
“cash” – to cover the costs for building our production tool and filling
orders.
To accomplish our social goals, we ask that you
help us reach as many people as possible! Tell your friends, family,
strangers, boyfriends, husbands, best friends, coworkers – anyone and everyone
– about The Perfect Part. Please help us spread the
word via Instagram, Twitter, Facebook; however you’d
like.

If we don't raise all $20,000 by the completion of this campaign, all funders will be issued a full refund. This means that your donation is completely risk-free. You'll either receive the perk you chose or get your money back, depending on whether we meet our goal.
What if you raise excess funds on Indiegogo?
Where will that money go?

additional money raised in excess of our goal will be directly reinvested into
the company, and will be used to fund the following additional elements:
1. Launch of our website, www.tailoredavenue.com
2. The production of additional colors
3. Legal costs
How do I know I’ll love The Perfect
Part?
Travis spent weeks asking friends, family and
coworkers who rock the gentleman’s side part whether or not they have ever had
a problem parting their hair. Typical feedback received included “It’s not
easy, but I do it”; “It takes too long”; “The line is never straight or how I
want it” and more. When Travis explained his product, all of these gentlemen
were intrigued and excited to try it out. We are confident you will feel the
same way.
What about quality?
The Perfect Part is designed for
strength and durability using the best materials on the market. The combs are
constructed of polypropylene plastic and a zinc plated torsion spring. This is
a premium high quality product that men will be proud to carry around.
Why we know The Perfect Part will
work for you:
If you’ve ever used a
standard comb, this product will work for you. For best results, the product
should be used on wet hair.

THANK YOU!

for taking the time to learn about The Perfect Part. We
truly appreciate it!

<p>Welcome to <strong>“PROJEKT K”</strong></p>
<p><strong>What is Projekt K you ask?<br/></strong><br/>Projekt K is a fundraising campaign that we have developed in order to raise a minimum amount of money for the startup costs of Inked Industries Clothing Co. With “K” being the middle letter in the word, “Inked,” we decided to use that as an iconic symbol of our logo. Hence, “Projekt K” has begun.</p>
<p><strong>About us<br/></strong><br/>Based out of Los Angeles, California, Inked Industries is a tattoo influenced, art driven lifestyle apparel brand that combines parallel sub-cultures. Owner, Robert Cefola, has created different apparel brands over the last several years and is committed to turning his newest brand into the next major name on the market. Inked Industries would like to become vastly engrained in the tattoo industry, as well as the Skate, Surf, BMX, FMX, Motocross and MMA areas. However, Inked Industries is not defined by any one culture. It represents a culturally aware community of all ages and walks of life, not only in the United States, but world-wide.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need</strong></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong>We are looking to raise a </strong>Total of 19,500 dollarsfor startup costs.  This will enable us to pay for a new LLC in California, graphic artists for more designs on our t-shirts, an E-commerce website, copy-writes, and to bring our designer denim ideas from concept to product. So far, Inked Industries has been 100% self-funded. We believe so much in this business that we are ready and willing to continue to self-fund as much as we possibly can. We are only asking for what we need right now, and every little bit can be used. Fashion is one of the most common forms of self-expression. It is an art in itself and every one of us is a walking masterpiece.</p>

<p>It is greatly felt that the future of the game industry as well as the entire world will be completely altered by the invention of an inexpensive immersive HMD, and we very much owe appreciation to Oculus VR for developing such a fine product.</p>
<p>As for us, while working on AR (augmented reality), we came across a few problems that we believed if adjusted, would leave users even more satisfied. The biggest problems we encountered were that you couldn’t use your hands and the obstruction of the viewing angle. We were convinced that the Oculus Rift was the first major product to fix these inconveniences, and in doing so, had created an AR device that was more immersive than anything which has come before. We completed our prototype, and developed it to be used in conjunction with the Oculus Rift. Our new product is the ""Vision Sensor for Oculus Rift DevKit""!</p>
<p></p>
<h2><b>WHAT HAPPENS IF WE DON’T REACH OUR GOAL?!</b></h2>
<p>Regardless of how much we are able to collect during our fund raising effort, you can rest assured that all Vision Sensors purchased will be shipped and built to our contributors who have support us! </p>
<p>Our parent company, Shinobiya.com Co., Ltd., plans on using the Vision Sensor in an amusement park maze built here in Japan. The goal of $60,000 is to help fund the construction of this attraction. Even if we don’t meet this monetary goal, we will be more than able to produce any amount of ordered units.</p>

As for specific shipping dates, more detailed information will be sent directly through email in the near future.
If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact us.

<p>Of course there are some options on 
the market to patch this problem; however, very few, if any, help 
effectively resolve this ever growing issue.</p>
<p>- <b>NONE</b> of the other guys offer multiple units</p>
<p>- <b>MOST</b> of them are way <b>too expensive</b></p>
<p><b>- Only</b> offer<b> </b>one, <b>small</b>, <b>low capacity unit</b> to recharge your device</p>
<p>- <b>Or</b> one, <b>bulky</b>,<b> high capacity</b>, illogically designed unit</p>
<p>- <b>Have</b> <b>no way </b>of being recharged themselves after losing power except by standard wall charging which is obviously unavailable while traveling</p>
<p>- <b>Most</b> backup batteries<b> do not </b>give your mobile device a<b> 100% charge</b>, as promised.</p>
<p>The PowerKnots, however, not only solves <b>ALL </b>of
 these problems but also addresses the major problem of our mobile 
device usage outliving our mobile devices' internal battery capacity, thus providing you with this great product!</p>
<p><b>What most people DO NOT know!</b></p>
<p><b>1.</b> Fact: 
Milli-amps (mAh) converts to mAh only with the correct voltage output; 
for example, the iPhone 5s internal battery capacity is 1570mAh, one 
PowerKnot internal battery capacity is 5200mAh w/ a 3.7v battery pack and a 5v/1A power output, according to testing results, this means one PowerKnot can undoubtedly recharge your iPhone 5s up to 
3.31 times while not in constant use during the charging cycle! So now you know, any 
other claim that promises you more power with less voltages and mAh is 
<b>FALSE</b>!</p>
<p><b>2.</b> An<b> emergency charger</b> is often mistaken as a <b>backup charger</b>, they are very different products. One is more expensive than the other and both provide two different 
needs. One provides extended power (emergency), a little talk time, the other provides a 
full recharge to your mobile devices' internal battery (backup 
battery), full talk time restored. <b>DO NOT BE MISLEAD ANY LONGER!!!</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>The Competition...</b></p>
<p>Below I will outline some potential 
backup battery competitors, comparing them with the PowerKnots but I 
assure you, you will rate the PowerKnots #1 for many, or should I say 
""multiple"" reasons! :-)</p>

<b>Legion/1 piece unit- </b>Dimensions: 2.45 x 4.32 x 0.45 inches, <b>$79.99</b>, <b>5500mAh</b>, powerful but the size of an iPhone 4, not ideal for traveling, only <b>ONE</b> unit; too <b>bulky</b> to
 conveniently charge your device on the go if you don't lug around a

<ul><li>
<b>Ark/1 piece unit- </b>Dimensions: 90mm x 90mm x 20mm (3.54"" x 3.54"" x 0.78""), likely retails for <b>$99.99+</b>, <b>5200mAh</b>, <b>ONE over sized</b> unit, wireless charger, entirely <b>too much hassle</b> to charge including <b>installing</b> a wireless patch within your mobile phone or <b>using a bulky case to be compatible with the charging station</b>, as big as <b>a galaxy s3</b>, not logically designed for travel.

<p><b>The PowerKnots in order of units offered and their retail costs</b></p>
<ul><li>
<b>PowerKnots/4 piece unit w/charging station-</b> Dimensions: 65.00mm x 30.00mm x 28.00mm (2.36"" x 1.18"" x 1.10""), <b>$99.00</b>, <b>3.7v, 5200mAh, Li-ion battery pack</b>, changeable battery pack<b>.</b>
 Powerful, compact, sleek design; once one loses power you can use 
another one but unless you excessively use your mobile phone, one 
PowerKnot could last you all day.So why do you need so many? Why not? 
This product was designed to provide security and variety in the same or
 lower price range of our competitors. Leave one in your bag, one in 
your car, one in your pocket, one in your desk/locker at work, lend one 
to a friend, etc. But, if you decide to keep them all to yourself, 
you'll have the confidence of never being too far from instant power to 
keep you in touch with your world! It's certainly better than owning

 If you prefer to just own the PowerKnots by themselves, this option is 
for you! The PowerKnots can be recharged in many ways, plug it into your
 computer, your car charger or your wall charger, wherever you charge 
them make sure they're all charged when you leave home, otherwise you'll

 Powerful, compact, sleek design, once it loses power you can use 
another one, can't do that if you own just one unit from the other guys.
 This unit is great for anyone but ideal for business travelers, hikers,

<p><b>Design Plan</b></p>
<p>We will maintain a sleek, compact and safe 
design. The unit will be as small as logically possible to ensure 
convenience but sizable enough to pack the powerful capacity required to
 keep you charged. The PowerKnot will be a sealed unit, the USB stick 
will retract in the final design to rest inside the casing to avoid 
damage to this component. In addition, the LED lights will be placed by 
the input where your cable connects with the PowerKnot, we will do this 
to make it easier for you to see the status of your PowerKnots power 
left before it needs to be charged.</p>

case and will come with our logo and company branding on the back of the
 case with instructions on how to use the PowerKnots.<br/><br/><ul></ul>
<p><b>Manufacturing Plan</b></p>
<p>We're ready to go, the hard part is 
over. Research and testing and prototyping was all a success, now we're 
ready to get this product on the assembly line and in your possession! 
Upon reaching or exceeding (hint, hint :-)) our funding goal we will 
immediately contact our manufacturing partner to complete mold creation,
 tooling and to finalize our design to ensure that all the size 
requirements, component placements, LED lights, etc. are met and 
correct. Because this process is tedious, it will take roughly 30 to 40 
days to receive our finalized prototypes, after inspection of the 
prototypes and approval of the final product we will initiate mass 
production of the units. While we wait, we'll be working with our 
packaging partner and collecting survey data concerning your color 
choices and other information pertaining to any offered rewards that 
requires details from the backers. Also, if you're located nearby we 
just might deliver your PowerKnots to you personally! :-)</p>

</div></div>","Let's talk PowerKnots!Each individual PowerKnot comes equipped with:

3.7v (enough voltage to charge your device quickly)
5200mAh (enough power to charge your phone up to 3 times!)
Li-ion battery pack (same battery technology used in your mobile device)


The PowerKnots are guaranteed to charge your device fully (100%) as many times as it converts to your devices internal battery capacity (see Charging Chart below).Each PowerKnot is detachable from the charging station and can be taken with you anywhere. Each PowerKnot is equipped with a 3.7v, 5200mAh, Li-ion battery pack, packed full of power, this equates to a total power storage of: 20,800mAh (4 piece w/charging station), 31,200mAh (6 pack w/o charging station), 41,600mAh (8 piece (w/charging station, limited to this campaign)). That's a lot of power, you will NEVER be out of touch with your world, unless you break your phone :-o or you're in the wilderness for a few weeks without at least 6 PowerKnots. :-)Specifications

Waterproof casing!
Dimensions: 65.00mm x 30.00mm x 28.00mm (2.36"" x 1.18"" x 1.10"")
700 recharging cycles per PowerKnot!

Simultaneously recharges while connected to any USB input (i.e. Laptop, desktop, wall charger, car charger, etc.). Charge your device and your PowerKnot at the same time!
Smart charging! No on/off switch, when your device is plugged in it begins charging, when it's charged it shuts off and reserves the battery until you're ready for your next charge!
5 color choices (orange, blue, green, gray or black)
Our smooth, sleek, round edges delivers a safe, logical design!
2 LED indicator lights one to determine when your device is charged and one to determine when the PowerKnot is fully charged/low (LED will remain green for as long as there is power to charge a device and will turn yellow when it is low.)

The problem...
In this generation we are always on-the-move and mobile technology is not slack in keeping up with our busy lifestyles. Top brands readily design and redesign mobile devices to do practically ANYTHING in the palm of our hands, making them more and more user friendly to the point where our devices have become an extension to our everyday lives. However, keeping these advanced devices powered has become a major problem and with every upgrade it only gets worse -- they have yet to resolve it! So, if we are moving forward and mobile technology is moving forward, shouldn't the way we stay connected and in touch with our world be moving in the same direction? That's where we come in! Keep scrolling, you won't regret it!

Battery life has become a major problem and as the problem continues to grow, battery life continues to fail to keep up with the advancements of their counterparts; with the growing use of mobile devices to do anything from getting us from point A to point B to taking photos, texting, video chatting, dating, browsing the internet, shopping, interacting with your friends, fans and followers on your social networks and much more, battery life has become scarce and rather limited; the days of getting throughout a single day on one battery charge are over! Studies have shown an extraordinary increase in mobile device usage over the years and has suggested that we use our phone more than any other similarly valuable object in our lives (i.e. computers, tablets, cars, house keys, television, etc.).


It doesn't matter where we are or what we're doing, 
we're always checking our phones. Clearly our phones are the engine to 
our social lives, so it might be a good idea to always have power ready 
to back us up when our phone battery has run its course.
The real solution...
If
 you're a smartphone user you know firsthand that power is scarce and once you phone loses power, you're pretty much out of luck. That is the main reasons why we created 
the PowerKnots - this product is compatible with 5000+ USB 
enabled devices and can keep practically ANY USB capable device powered!
This is where we ended up...


The first born...

Although our brain wrenching revisions gave birth to this, singular beautiful, patent pending,
 logically designed, travel sized device, we weren't quite done and in 
fact an additional three (3) were created, thus creating the four (4) 
piece unit, then a six (6) pack, and lastly the limited edition eight 
(8) piece unit, along with an all-in-one charging station (a one source 
charging station for all the PowerKnots and any USB device you connect to the charging station!).



Just a glimpse at the passion that went into the design of the block itself. Designed to keep your device powered and to keep your PowerKnots safe from damage.
Backup power storage never before seen or offered in this fashion! Get a four piece w/5200mAh each & a charging station for less than the price of one, quality 6000mAh backup battery!
It's like taking a huge power bank and breaking it into little, even more powerful, portable units; with a drastic decrease in the cost of owning one of these powerful units!The PowerKnots first introduction to the world! At a coPhilly, PHLMade tech event in Philadelphia, PA!What exactly are the PowerKnots?

The PowerKnots are the worlds first, patent pending, 
multi-unit (4, 6, or 8 piece), high powered (3.7v, 5200mAh, Li-ion 
battery pack per PowerKnot), travel sized backup batteries (take them 
anywhere!) & charging station that truly fits your lifestyle - the ideal product for the growing need of backup power on-the-go!

Choosing has never been so easy!

#1. $75-$89 (during this campaign, slightly more afterwards), 4pcs, total power storage 20,800mAh!

#2. $40-$100, 1pc, total power storage 4000mAh. But seriously, this isn't a price battle, although we beat them in that area, too! ;-)
Why choose the PowerKnots over the other guys?




Choose from a 6 pack (PowerKnots only), a 4 piece unit w/charging 
station or an 8 piece unit w/charging station  (limited to this 
campaign).
Experience the same speed of charging as if your device was plugged into a car port or wall outlet.
Smart charging! No on/off switch, when your device is plugged into a
 PowerKnot it begins charging instantly, when it's charged it shuts off 
until you're ready for your next charge!
700 recharging cycles per PowerKnot!
Offered coverage plan for parts, repairs and battery replacement!
One charging station for all the PowerKnots & your mobile device to be recharged at one time!
Smarter, compact & safer design!
Simultaneous charging and recharging capability of the PowerKnots!
Cost effective!
High Powered (3.7v, 5200mAh, Li-ion battery pack in each of the PowerKnots!) 3+ recharges for most smart phones!
Take them anywhere (easily store them)
Store them in different locations for that ""just in case"" moment (i.e. car, work desk, bag, purse, coat/jacket pocket, etc.)
Break free of the electrical outlet, so much power you'll rarely use your wall charger!
Select from 5 color options: green, orange, blue, black & gray!
Get better quality and more quantity for your money!



""Why do I need more than one backup battery?""


So why do 
you need so many? Why not? Practically no one is exempt from the growing
 use of smart devices, nearly everyone uses their mobile device for far 
more than just a phone call, text or email. This product was designed to
 provide security and variety.


Charge 5000+ USB capable devices, not just your phone but 
your camera, watch, iPod, GameBoy, anything!
Have power anywhere you may need it!
For your convenience, leave
 one in your bag, one in your car, one in your pocket, one in your 
desk/locker at work, lend one to a friend, etc.


No matter what the circumstances are, you'll always have the confidence of never being too far from instant power to 
keep you in touch with your world - no matter how long you're away from a
 power outlet! It's certainly better than owning just one huge backup 
battery.

Let's talk numbers...According to market research of comparable products an individual PowerKnot can go for roughly $89 - $129 and each individual charging
 station for $40 - $70. Each 4 piece unit can go for $189, each 6 pack 
for $219, and each 8 piece unit for $269.We are in fact leveraging this information, but not for massive profits, instead, we're using it to increase the number 
of people our product will reach!Compare us to them...We're bigger in a smaller and better way! :-)- Our four (4) piece unit priced at $70 - $89 (during this campaign)- Their one (1) piece unit priced at $59 - $99 (on the market)For
 just around $30 more you'll receive three additional units of the 
PowerKnots which includes 17,800mAh more power!

What can the PowerKnots be used for?The PowerKnots can be used for any USB 
capable product and any purpose including excessive business traveling, 
construction site workers, hikers, mail carriers, bus drivers, obsessive
 mobile device users, dispersing a unit to family members or friends for 
potential emergencies, campers, general power storage for USB capable 
devices and much more!


We aren't the first, but we certainly are the best!


We know we aren't the first backup battery on the market but the fact remains that we are in fact the first
 to offer the convenience of more than one, reliable, high powered unit 
at a remarkable price point and because our patent is working its way 
through the United States Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO) we will 
be the only, original company you can get this product from in all it's original 
greatness!

Everything they don't offer, we do!


1. There are currently no backup
 batteries on the market that provides a one source recharging station 
for all the units offered and any USB device at the same time (because the other guys only offer one unit)



2. That are small enough to fit practically anywhere on your person


3. That are smart enough to save your power after a charge (no on/off button, it does it itself to give you one 
less thing to worry about, just plug and go!)


4. Powerful enough to quickly recharge your mobile phone 3+ times depending
 on your devices' internal battery capacity and unlike others, the 
charge lasts just as if it were charged via a wall plug!


5. That are priced to beat every one of our competitors! Check out our perks for proof!

What's more logical for your travels?



A real world example of the simplicity involved in using the PowerKnots; the prototype plugged into an iPhone 5!



It's really that simple! Plug and go, anytime, anywhere; three or more recharges per PowerKnot for most smart phones!What's out there?
Of course there are some options on 
the market to patch this problem; however, very few, if any, help 
effectively resolve this ever growing issue.
- NONE of the other guys offer multiple units
- MOST of them are way too expensive
- Only offer one, small, low capacity unit to recharge your device
- Or one, bulky, high capacity, illogically designed unit
- Have no way of being recharged themselves after losing power except by standard wall charging which is obviously unavailable while traveling
- Most backup batteries do not give your mobile device a 100% charge, as promised.
The PowerKnots, however, not only solves ALL of
 these problems but also addresses the major problem of our mobile 
device usage outliving our mobile devices' internal battery capacity, thus providing you with this great product!
What most people DO NOT know!
1. Fact: 
Milli-amps (mAh) converts to mAh only with the correct voltage output; 
for example, the iPhone 5s internal battery capacity is 1570mAh, one 
PowerKnot internal battery capacity is 5200mAh w/ a 3.7v battery pack and a 5v/1A power output, according to testing results, this means one PowerKnot can undoubtedly recharge your iPhone 5s up to 
3.31 times while not in constant use during the charging cycle! So now you know, any 
other claim that promises you more power with less voltages and mAh is 
FALSE!
2. An emergency charger is often mistaken as a backup charger, they are very different products. One is more expensive than the other and both provide two different 
needs. One provides extended power (emergency), a little talk time, the other provides a 
full recharge to your mobile devices' internal battery (backup 
battery), full talk time restored. DO NOT BE MISLEAD ANY LONGER!!!

The Competition...
Below I will outline some potential 
backup battery competitors, comparing them with the PowerKnots but I 
assure you, you will rate the PowerKnots #1 for many, or should I say 
""multiple"" reasons! :-)


A glance at some of the other guys, some are beautifully designed but 
none of them offer you more than what you see in each image; one, lone 
unit, plus they are all pretty large

The other guys...

Bolt/1 piece unit- Dimensions: 70mm x 34mm x 28mm (2.75"" x 1.33"" x 1.10""), $59.99, Samsung 3000mAh battery, small but oddly shaped w/pointy edges, low Milliamps (won't stand up to the growing power needs in the now future) and its only ONE unit, once the backup battery loses power it must be recharged via an electrical outlet.

Eton BoostBloc/1 piece unit- Dimensions: 55.88mm x 127mm x 25.4mm (2.20"" x 5.00"" x 1.00""), $69.79, 6600mAh; relatively large, oddly shaped and powerful, but it's only ONE unit and it's over priced and the fact remains that once it loses its charge, that's it!


ViewCharger/1 piece unit- Dimensions: unknown, but from the images its pretty big, $69.99, 6000mAh battery, powerful but bulky, not ideal for travel and its only ONE unit, once it loses its charge, back to the wall socket you go, if you can find one!

Legion/1 piece unit- Dimensions: 2.45 x 4.32 x 0.45 inches, $79.99, 5500mAh, powerful but the size of an iPhone 4, not ideal for traveling, only ONE unit; too bulky to
 conveniently charge your device on the go if you don't lug around a 
purse or book bag, overpriced and once it losses its power, that's it!

JuiceBee/1 piece unit- Dimensions: 90mm x 36mm x 33mm, $69.00, 3000mAh, ONE unit, small but no design sense, low Milliamps, once it loses its power there is no other source of recharging except by an electrical outlet.

Ark/1 piece unit- Dimensions: 90mm x 90mm x 20mm (3.54"" x 3.54"" x 0.78""), likely retails for $99.99+, 5200mAh, ONE over sized unit, wireless charger, entirely too much hassle to charge including installing a wireless patch within your mobile phone or using a bulky case to be compatible with the charging station, as big as a galaxy s3, not logically designed for travel. Once this unit is drained, that's it, it doesn't ""wirelessly"" recharge itself...

The PowerKnots...
Sizing the PowerKnots up, all four of the 4 piece unit amounts to the 
size of an encased iPhone 5 - standard, high capacity backup batteries 
are typically that huge! The only thing big about this product is the 
power it packs to keep you charged! 
The PowerKnots in order of units offered and their retail costs

PowerKnots/4 piece unit w/charging station- Dimensions: 65.00mm x 30.00mm x 28.00mm (2.36"" x 1.18"" x 1.10""), $99.00, 3.7v, 5200mAh, Li-ion battery pack, changeable battery pack.
 Powerful, compact, sleek design; once one loses power you can use 
another one but unless you excessively use your mobile phone, one 
PowerKnot could last you all day.So why do you need so many? Why not? 
This product was designed to provide security and variety in the same or
 lower price range of our competitors. Leave one in your bag, one in 
your car, one in your pocket, one in your desk/locker at work, lend one 
to a friend, etc. But, if you decide to keep them all to yourself, 
you'll have the confidence of never being too far from instant power to 
keep you in touch with your world! It's certainly better than owning 
just one huge backup battery.

PowerKnots/6 pack (charging station not included)- Dimensions: 65.00mm x 30.00mm x 28.00mm (2.36"" x 1.18"" x 1.10""), $119.00, 3.7v, 5200/mAh, Li-ion battery pack.
 If you prefer to just own the PowerKnots by themselves, this option is 
for you! The PowerKnots can be recharged in many ways, plug it into your
 computer, your car charger or your wall charger, wherever you charge 
them make sure they're all charged when you leave home, otherwise you'll
 be angry!

PowerKnots 8/piece unit w/charging station- Dimensions: 65.00mm x 30.00mm x 28.00mm (2.36"" x 1.18"" x 1.10""), $150.00, 3.7v, 5200mAh, Li-ion battery pack.
 Powerful, compact, sleek design, once it loses power you can use 
another one, can't do that if you own just one unit from the other guys.
 This unit is great for anyone but ideal for business travelers, hikers,
 farmers, mailmen/women, excessive mobile phone users (like me), outdoor
 research groups, construction site workers, mall shoppers, etc.

The inside of the charging station. A plug for all the PowerKnots and any USB capable device! The eight piece will be the same with 8 ports, 4 on each side.


Design Plan
We will maintain a sleek, compact and safe 
design. The unit will be as small as logically possible to ensure 
convenience but sizable enough to pack the powerful capacity required to
 keep you charged. The PowerKnot will be a sealed unit, the USB stick 
will retract in the final design to rest inside the casing to avoid 
damage to this component. In addition, the LED lights will be placed by 
the input where your cable connects with the PowerKnot, we will do this 
to make it easier for you to see the status of your PowerKnots power 
left before it needs to be charged.
Beautiful, safe, smooth and stylish finish. The USB connection enables 
you to simply plug your standard USB cable into a PowerKnot and 
instantly begin charging any USB capable device!Branding prospect
The PowerKnots will be branded with the product
 name along the side of the charging station, it will read ""PowerKnots 
by TechSquare."" On each PowerKnot the same branding will be on top of 
the unit. Like our logo, ""Power"" will be green and ""Knots"" will remain 
black.
PackagingWe're considering a travel case as packaging, this will be a reusable 
case and will come with our logo and company branding on the back of the
 case with instructions on how to use the PowerKnots.
Manufacturing Plan
We're ready to go, the hard part is 
over. Research and testing and prototyping was all a success, now we're 
ready to get this product on the assembly line and in your possession! 
Upon reaching or exceeding (hint, hint :-)) our funding goal we will 
immediately contact our manufacturing partner to complete mold creation,
 tooling and to finalize our design to ensure that all the size 
requirements, component placements, LED lights, etc. are met and 
correct. Because this process is tedious, it will take roughly 30 to 40 
days to receive our finalized prototypes, after inspection of the 
prototypes and approval of the final product we will initiate mass 
production of the units. While we wait, we'll be working with our 
packaging partner and collecting survey data concerning your color 
choices and other information pertaining to any offered rewards that 
requires details from the backers. Also, if you're located nearby we 
just might deliver your PowerKnots to you personally! :-)

A little about us...
We're very passionate about technology, particularly mobile technology especially since we do absolutely NOTHING without our mobile devices. We're a team of highly talented businessmen and women, electrical and mechanical engineers, design specialist, manufacturing professionals, logistics geniuses and energy experts and with our combined skills and knowledge we've created the PowerKnots and have many other great products in the making!

Why we need your support...We require a minimum of $25,000 to begin our first run of production, upon reaching our goal and the end of this campaign we can hit the ground running and have our first run shipped to you, the supporters, within two months!If we don't reach our goal...
If we don't reach our minimum goal we will still be able to produce the PowerKnots, however, we would be required to sign a contract to repay the manufacture based on future projected sales.
Your contribution will ensure that we remain an independent company with no debt or obligation to make future payments to our manufacturer. We do understand that in the future we will require investors to help us scale our manufacturing efforts and if we can remain debt free we will be a more ideal investment opportunity for future investors.
A product EVERYONE has been waiting for...
For quite some time now, consumers has been searching for the ideal product to keep them charged for more than just a few hours. Today, our mobile phones are practically our everything from radio to day planner to travel guide; apps from shopping to dating dominate our attention and mutilate our battery life -- the PowerKnots changes this dynamic by offer multiple, high capacity, travel sized backup batteries!

Internal Battery capacity for popular devices & PowerKnots recharging capabilities for each individual device:
Formula:
 Devices internal battery capacity/PowerKnot internal battery capacity =
 total number of full recharges per PowerKnot, per device. (Example: An 
iPhone 4 will be calculated as follows: 1420mAh/5200mAh = 3.66 recharges
 per PowerKnot, per iPhone 4). If your device is not listed simply use 
this formula to calculate how the PowerKnots will power your device.

THE TIME CHANGES FACEFirst of all, FIXO is a multi-face clock with weather forecast and Google Calendar appointments at a glance. But let’s get it straight: Fixo isn’t just reminiscence of your classic table clock, it’s a smart disc that’s integrated with a number of apps and smart objects. 
 
A NEW USER EXPERIENCE
Designed to be placed on a table or wall and even comfortable to hold thanks to the wide frame, FIXO comes with a complete set of dedicated applications.  













 Inside of a nine and a half inch disc (24 cm), FIXO is equipped with a round touchscreen, an HD camera, 2 inch stereo speakers and three wide touchscreen buttons, for easy access to the main commands.
 WHAT FIXO CAN DO?

Like a computer, FIXO can perform endless tasks. But what are the main advantages of a device designed for stationary use? It enriches your life at home with information at a glance, gives a great music experience with stereo loudspeakers, provides remote monitoring features interacting with your mobile device, is always connected with smart home accessories.
 

THE SMART OBJECTS
A set of special SMART OBJECTS completes FIXO in the tasks of home automation, security, health and wellness for tracking activities and remote monitoring. 
 
 


 
ONE APP FOR EACH DAILY TASK
FIXO is equipped with all the apps you need for each daily task. Set up the alarm or any other event with one touch. With multicolor SMART BULBS going off smoothly you will fall asleep and wake up in a gentle mood with a light and your favourite music increasing softly.
 

 


 
The SMART SCALE distinguishes users by the last recorded measurement, stores data and displays the evolution of weight over the time while the fitness app counts your exercises and helps you to stay fit.

 
FIXO brings in your kitchen thousands of recipes to follow easily step by step and to browse with a touch (feature in development stage)
 The music player offers your music via streaming organized by artist and album and gives the visual experience of the rotating vinyl record that goes straight to the heart of music lovers. 
 
With the multicolor SMART BULBS light up your parties to the rhythm of music while the integrated HD camera records videos and takes selfies. You can share your shots or present an instantaneous slideshow like a photo frame.
 

 
Safety requires automation. With KEY TAGS, FIXO knows who is at home, switching the alarm on when the whole family is out; you can set the action related to the button on KEY TAG: take picture, play music, switch the lights or send an SOS.
 


 
Good quality speakers, 3-axis accelerometer and the circular shape make it a device very suitable for gaming.

 

YOUR GOOGLE AT A GLANCE
FIXO is a cloud based device integrated with Google eco-system. You can store photos and videos on Google Drive and share it on Google+, add new events with a touch and see them on your smartphone with Google Calendar or present a slideshow of your Google Photos.

<h3>The Keeper's Vision...</h3>
<p>“Just glue some gears on it, and call it Steampunk.” By Reginald Pikedevant says it all. Within the mock Steampunk community and also in the unreal alternate history that gets mislabeled as Steampunk, we have seen too many people glue gears on mundane items to pass as Steampunk.</p>

<p>My personal designs consist of clockwork pieces, cogs, sprockets, gauged wires, feathers, leather,By polymer clay, Swarovski crystals, filigree, findings, real and glass pearls and anything else I can get my hands on.

<h3>My Situation...</h3>
<div>
<p>My goal with this campaign is to be able to buy a work bench with a large enough workspace so I can work on several projects at the same time. As it stands right now I am based out of my dining room area and have consumed the entire space of my dining table. I just recently bought a storage shelf-but it can only hold so much material. The husband is working on our bare studded attic to make it into a living/ work space. So hopefully by the summer I can move everything up into the finished attic.</p>

About the Tee

My quality basic tee will be manufacturerd in Los Angeles with 100% premium combed cotton. It features a thin and lightweight yarn, a bleached-white color, a left-chest pocket, and a modern fit. The tee is pre-shunk and silicon-washed for a lived-in handfeel, and is available in sizes S, M, L, and XL. In the photo below, I am wearing a size Medium.

About Me

After graduating from Colgate University, I moved to Columbus, OH, where I work as a merchant for a fashion-retail company. I am also a student at Cotton University, the Columbus College of Art and Design, and the Columbus Cultural Arts Center, where I take adult classes in cotton production, yarn manufacturing, pattern-making, figure drawing, and digital art. I have a love for minimal and practical design, a passion for the creative arts, and a strong desire to pay it forward.",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>We at Life Matters Journal have a goal and a mission: to make aggressive violence of all kinds unthinkable. We want to make it history. The only way that we can do this is to change hearts and minds to understand that all human life is worth protecting.</p>
<p>So, we agreed that one of the best ways to spread the message for peace and all life is through clothing -- it brings the message wherever you go, and invites conversation. We hope that in uniting around our project, people feel the strength of community and support for our cause and do not get discouraged against the apathy and inconsistency of our world.</p>
<h1>CHOOSE A DIFFERENT SIDE.</h1>
<p>By creating this clothing line, not only do we engender community within our movement and support the further education and discourse so necessary to changing hearts and minds, we offer a way to begin discussions, to bring these issues to the forefront of society.</p>
<p>Many of us are tired of the dual-party politics in the United States that offers only halfway solutions to violence; instead of choosing which lives are valuable, we want to offer a different way. Valuing all human life: opposing capital punishment, abortion, unjust war, embryonic stem cell research, torture, abuse, human trafficking, and all other forms of aggressive violent action.</p>
<p>By wearing these shirts, individuals young and old can start that conversation that will plant that seed. Maybe we can work to hold our politicians accountable and change the discourse in this country to one that values peace and life.</p>
<h1>BE CONSISTENT.</h1>
<p>The Life Matters Clothing Initiative is a design and production project to bring these messages to the streets in our every-day wear. Our team has been hard at work to produce designs worthy of wear and conversation. We've produced many designs and they've gone to a vote on our Facebook page. </p>
<p>Our printing will all be done through a local-to-Pittsburgh eco-friendly print shop who we trust to be good to our cause and to the planet. Though we have put all of our own resources into the design process, we need your help, as a global community, to print these shirts and spread our message. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Maryam Entezami. I was born in Iran, in 1980 my family and I left Iran for Turkey. Since 1990 I live in Netherlands. In 1997 I graduated as a fashion designer. During my study I took a “ History of Costumes” Course. To my surprise there was little to no information available on Ancient Persian costumes.  At first I was really disappointed but it also triggered my ambition. It became my graduation project and I continued my research when I started as an independent fashion designer up till today.</p>
<p>My investigation covers the Persian Women Costume from the Elam (2700 – 538 B.C.) dynasty to date including the folkloric costumes. Over the years I have been collecting information, translating historic images into concrete designs.</p>
<p>My ultimate goal is to publish a book that shows the richness in Ancient Persian Costume tradition from the ancient Iranian History since Elamites Dynasty (2700-538 B.C.) to Pahlavi Dynasty (1925-1979) illustrated with pictures of my fashion designs as a direct translation. </p>

a few days for you to design your orders from the handmade fabrics
5 weeks for our first production run at our sewing facility (their requirement).

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>My name is Marilyn and I love accessories.  I asked myself what could I do, in my own small way, to help people?  To some, a handbag is just something to carry your things in.  To others, a bag is a fabulous fashion statement.  However, one bag can make a difference!  I want to donate thousands of handbags, backpacks, duffle bags, tote bags, clutches, and toiletries to organizations that collect accessories and other items to help girls/women/children. </p>
<p>Initially, we started saving a percentage of our sales and found an organization that collects backpacks, duffle bags, and toiletries for foster children.  We purchased bags, toothpaste, deodorant, toothbrushes, brushes, combs and other toiletries and shipped the items to them and felt compelled to do more....to find more organizations to help and to help this organization again. </p>

<p>Imagine you're in a shelter, without even the basic necessities. We want to donate deodorant, toothbrushes, toothpaste, lotions, combs, brushes, other necessary toiletries, tote bags and duffle bags to organizations that collect these items for shelters.  With your contribution, we can provide items to the shelters that need them.</p>
<p>Imagine you were out of the job market for a length of time.  You need to go on interviews, but do not have anything appropiate to wear.  You turn to your local organization that collects suits/career wear to get you started in the right direction.  We want to donate clutches and handbags to these organizations that promote the career advancement of women.  With your contribution, we can help women go into their interviews with confidence.</p>
<p>Imagine you're a senior in high school.  All of your friends are talking about the dress, shoes, and bag they're going to get for prom.  Your family cannot afford to buy a dress....you are crestfallen!  On the radio, you hear about a local organization that has collected and is giving away prom dresses.  The day is saved!  We want to donate clutches and handbags to these organizations that do such a great service for these young ladies.  I remember how excited my daughter was.... shopping for prom... and how much it meant to her to look her best.  With your contribution, we can help other girls have a beautiful prom.</p>

<p><strong>Our Story</strong></p>
<p>See a Scarlet Robin piece of jewelry, and you'll want to touch it.  Hold it, and you'll want to put it on.  Wear it and, as we hear from hundreds of customers, it will become your daily style signature.</p>
<p>Right now, well over 90% of the 5K+ orders we've crafted have been placed online, by people who couldn't touch or try on before buying.  We come to you for help in getting our silver, gold and copper designs onto the counters of hundreds of boutiques around the world, so that a great many more people can experience the indulgence that is wearing a luxurious, handmade, Scarlet Robin treasure.</p>
<p>How do we take our business from e-commerce to a local shop or boutique near you?  Because it’s impossible for us to visit each and every boutique across the country, we need to be at an event where hundreds of shop owners have gathered.  To do this, we need to be in New York the first week of August for the event where shop owners will come find all the cool merchandise to fill their shelves for the holidays.  It’s like one big shopping spree for boutique owners.</p>
<p>We were chosen to be a part of this event in New York, and we must go!  But its shockingly expensive.  Every bit of your support you share means the world to us.  Every friend you forward our video to and share our story with is incredibly helpful.  You will most definitely be rewarded in all sorts of clever ways—because that’s what we do</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Your Contribution</strong></p>
<p>Ask any Scarlet Robin customer and they will tell you we have impeccable customer service, hands down.  They will also tell you we provide prompt response to inquiries, incredibly friendly service, and satisfaction in being well taken care of.  You will most certainly not be an exception when it comes time for us to reward you for your financial contribution.</p>
<p>To make your experience a bit more interesting, we thought you would like to see specific items that your contribution will make possible.</p>
<p>If you donate $600, this amount will cover our transportations costs (a plane ticket for Jillian, and gas to/from New York for Jenifer).</p>
<p>Interested in donating $1,500?  Cool!  You just paid for our hotel and lodging expenses for the week.</p>
<p>That $800 burning a hole in your pocket pays for our Fall 2012 Catalog costs.  Sweet!</p>
<p>We will graciously free you from the burden of hiding that $4,000 under your mattress and pay the booth fees for this glorious event. </p>
<p>Yes, we enjoy having a little fun now and again, but we are incredibly grateful for your donation.  We look forward to the opportunity to personally thank each of you with your very own Scarlet Robin treasure.</p>

<p>Over the years we (Nam and Phil) have always wanted to launch a clothing brand. Last year, we finally found a supplier who produces the quality and workmanship we were looking for, with experience with a few labels in Australia and New Zealand. After extensive research, factory trips overseas, and perfecting samples, we discovered the perfect fabrics and worked out our final designs for our opening collection.</p>
<p>We designed every item to fit together as a balanced silhouette. Our pants have a ""carrot"" fit with a relaxed rise, and our T-shirts, sweaters and coats are slightly elongated to meet mid way on the pant zipper to balance the upper and lower body. A carrot fit means that the upper legs until just past the knees are slightly baggier than the traditional slim jean, going slim from the knee to the ankle. The relaxed rise slightly lowers the crotch of the pants to meet perfectly with the length of our t's and sweaters. </p>
<p>The fabric is just as important as the fit as we want our pieces to not only be comfortable - we want them to last.</p>
<p>We hope that with this campaign we give you some quality staples, as well as help fund our Spring/Summer ‘19 line.  This includes our website, photography, and sampling costs. </p>
<p>To start we are offering a package with a crew neck, hoodie and 2 t's - details of each are below.</p>
<p>Hoodie - We chose a brushed 100% cotton for the hoodie. Brushing the cotton during the processing stage, before weaving, removes the short strands of cotton. This process mitigates balling of the material and ensures the sweater will maintain a soft feel. The sweater wears slightly elongated with a hidden front pocket design. Currently offered in black, navy and grey.<br/><br/>Crew Neck - For the crew neck we chose a lighter weight brushed 100% cotton. Similarly, we elongated the sweater to fit slightly longer than a traditional crew neck. Currently offered in black, navy and green.<br/><br/>T- Shirts - We chose a double weaved brushed 100% cotton. A double weaved cotton created a tighter and softer finish to the fabric while maintaining the feel of a traditional cotton. The brushed jersey cotton creates a softer cotton with a slight natural stretch.   </p>
<p>More details on all clothing and the rest of our products will be up on our website, which we hope to have up and running in the next few months. Chinos, jeans and jackets will be available soon.</p>
<p>Many thanks to all who participate. We look forward to sharing our full line soon.</p>
<p>Because the products are being manufactured - need to be shipped to us - then shipped to you, they will be delivered in 5 - 6 weeks.<br/><br/>Phil and Nam</p>

The first step was to replace the outer layer of woven fabric with a brushed fleece. This provided two significant benefits: enhanced flexibility and increased insulation. Woven fabric is typically more rigid than fleece because it is constructed in a tight grid. Replacing this with fleece allowed us to unlock our tech fabric's stretch, enhancing our garments' ability to move with your body. This modification also increased insulation by thickening our heat-retentive layer without compromising our breathability.</p><p>The goal of this product line was to blend the functionality of outerwear with the comfort and style of common fleece garments. That's why we paired functional features such as waterproof zippers, enclosing pockets, vents, and cinches with a slimming fit and minimalistic aesthetic.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1511900479/zj37exlwsmjfzzxjbjmf.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>We know the importance of partnering with a like-minded manufacturer when bringing a concept like this to market.

Our fabric contains a state-of-the-art, 10k waterproof membrane, similar to high-end outerwear brands. Because of this, moisture is blocked at the middle of the fabric, leaving the user dry as can be. It's super-soft and flexible properties mimic common fleece, rather than feeling like typically rigid rain gear.    We're a group of hikers, campers, surfers, and snowboarders. We started MINIM to create versatile pieces that could span our lives, allowing us to focus more on getting outside and less on packing the right gear. We believe that less is more, and in order to fully experience the world, we can't be weighed down with countless material objects. That's why we create all of our garments with 3-in-1 versatility: providing the protection of outerwear, comfort of loungewear, and styling of your favorite daily pieces. Blending innovative materials with utilitarian design, we build our garments for work and play while lasting for years to come. We started with a tailored, unisex fit and added a tapered waist, raglan sleeves, and elevated neck construction. Put shortly, this jacket was form fitted to provide unparalleled motion and flexibility while being active. The fleece is an ultra-soft brushed polyester, designed to provide warmth when you need it and not weigh you down. Each jacket has zip close pockets to keep your stuff safe and reinforced stitching to last for years to come.       Our brand was born with the release of our all weather hoodie. After the development and release of this staple piece, we knew that we could create something with even greater versatility. Thus, we brought in our network outdoor lovers and got to work to create something truly special.  We began with our signature MINIM tech fleece found in our current hoodies and pants. The first step was to replace the outer layer of woven fabric with a brushed fleece. This provided two significant benefits: enhanced flexibility and increased insulation. Woven fabric is typically more rigid than fleece because it is constructed in a tight grid. Replacing this with fleece allowed us to unlock our tech fabric's stretch, enhancing our garments' ability to move with your body. This modification also increased insulation by thickening our heat-retentive layer without compromising our breathability.The goal of this product line was to blend the functionality of outerwear with the comfort and style of common fleece garments. That's why we paired functional features such as waterproof zippers, enclosing pockets, vents, and cinches with a slimming fit and minimalistic aesthetic. We know the importance of partnering with a like-minded manufacturer when bringing a concept like this to market. That's why, after a two-week journey touring factories across China, we partnered with Yufengling Garment Company. Located near Dongguan, they have a plethora of experience working with high-end western brands while maintaining a safe and clean work environment. They've been making our current product for a year and have already begun producing your Method Jackets!",41.0,0,"2 Campaigns

Initially we worked on just one design, however we finally settled on three designs. You'll be asked which design you would like via a survey when the Kickstarter campaign is complete.            Each watch comes with your choice of a titanium bracelet or a silicone strap. Both are custom designed to fit the H1 perfectly. We'll ask you for your preference via a survey when the Kickstarter campaign is complete.  The Hamtun H1 was designed in the UK but is being manufactured in China. Once the campaign finishes, we'll collect backer preferences and then will place our order with the factories in early November. The timeline we've put together factors in Chinese holidays in the new year. We'll work hard to beat this schedule, but currently we expect to deliver in May 2017.Throughout the manufacturing and quality control phases we will keep all backers updated on our Facebook page, via Twitter, and via email. Every Hamtun H1 comes with a 2 year warranty against manufacturing or movement defects. The Hamtun H1 will ship worldwide. When backing the project, you'll be asked where in the world you'd like your watch shipped to and the appropriate fee will be added to your pledge. We'll contact you when the project funds to get your address.The Hamtun H1 ships from the UK via courier to anywhere worldwide. If you're outside the EU, you'll need to confirm any import duties you may be required to pay with your local customs office.This campaign quickly flew past the funding goal and left us with some decisions to make. We're delivering what we hope is a great value watch, but by doing so we do not have huge margins with which to offer vast number of ""free"" extras. The majority of the extra funding will go in to ensuring that quality is of a very high standard, by both having extra checks at the factory and here before dispatch to you.However there were a few requests that kept coming up in discussion, so we've managed to secure the following stretch goals. We hope that a big focus on quality and these extras make everyone happy.If we reach £50,000 we’ll upgrade the lume across all watched to Super-LumiNova. On the dial and bezel this will be blue BGW9.THIS GOAL HAS BEEN UNLOCKEDIf we reach the £75,000 mark we’ll include both the custom silicone strap and custom titanium bracelet with all watchers. Ordered more than one watch? Each of them will get both straps.THIS GOAL HAS BEEN UNLOCKEDIf we reach £85,000 we’ll drill the lugs through. This makes swapping straps far easier, and also allows use of stronger bars to attach you straps, meaning it'll be even more secure on your dives.THIS GOAL HAS BEEN UNLOCKEDIf we reach £100,000 we’ll put serial numbers on the back of all of the watches. This will identify your watch as part of the first production run. Those on the super early-bird reward level will get a low number.THIS GOAL HAS BEEN UNLOCKED",40.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">How the Design Miners was initiated?</span></strong></p>
I started digging into the history of design exhibitions in 2011, when I was accepted on a doctoral program in History of Design at the Royal College of Art, London. The research gained recognition from the international Design History Society and the Polish Ministry of Heritage and Culture, which resulted in short term research grants. It was also included in the program of a conference organised at the Parsons’ New School of Design in New York, at the Royal College of Art in London and recently at the Modernist Studies Association annual conference held <span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">at the University of Sussex </span>in at Brighton. <p></p>
<p></p>I initiated Design
Miners to raise funds to complete this research on time
and save an important part of cultural, economical and political history of
Eastern Europe from being forgotten. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">I need your help to make it happen. </span><p></p>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><br/></span><p></p>
<p></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">What your money will go for?</span></strong></p>
The money you will contribute will go <span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">towards researching the exhibitions' history</span>. To complete it, I need to raise £38,700.

Design Miners at the London Design Festival



Bashko Trybek's Made of Coal pieces was shown at the Young Creative Poland - 4 Years On exhibition during London Design Festival alongside the video teaser. Thank you all for popping in and the positive freedback!


What is the Design Miners all about?
The Design Miners gets together people and organisations that want to get involved in digging into history of design and exhibitions in particular.
What coal has to do with design?
The whole story begins with coal that used
to be called Poland’s ""black gold”. From the
late 40s, in order to promote it on the international market, the state
commissioned the best creative professionals to design trade fair displays that would impress audiences around the
globe. These
exhibitions – prepared by visionary graphic designers, architects, painters and
musicians – are part of the bigger narrative that I am trying to explore.

How the Design Miners was initiated?
I started digging into the history of design exhibitions in 2011, when I was accepted on a doctoral program in History of Design at the Royal College of Art, London. The research gained recognition from the international Design History Society and the Polish Ministry of Heritage and Culture, which resulted in short term research grants. It was also included in the program of a conference organised at the Parsons’ New School of Design in New York, at the Royal College of Art in London and recently at the Modernist Studies Association annual conference held at the University of Sussex in at Brighton. 
I initiated Design
Miners to raise funds to complete this research on time
and save an important part of cultural, economical and political history of
Eastern Europe from being forgotten. I need your help to make it happen. 


What your money will go for?
The money you will contribute will go towards researching the exhibitions' history. To complete it, I need to raise £38,700. That covers remaining tuition fees of £16,256 and the minimal costs of two years research – such as obtaining archival materials, travels, accommodation and other expenses. I set up the campaign goal as a moderate £10,000. This amount would enable me to cover part of the research expenses and continue the work. Design Miners is a flexible campaign, which means that if we reach the goal, the fees from indiegogo.com will be 4% instead of 9% of the raised amount.

<h3>The Project:</h3>
<p></p>
<p><span>Underhill is one of the first green-roof homes in New Jersey:  it will conserve energy, reduce stormwater runoff, and preserve habitat for plants and animals. Designed to support a full 12"" of earth on its roof, it goes beyond simple green roofing to allow a full restoration of landscape over the top of it: shrubs, small trees, and other plants native to its woodland location.  Sitting deep in a hillside, it has relatively low exposed walls - and those are built of native stone that we gathered on-site.

<p>Phase 1 of the project was built with our own hands, our own muscles and sweat, the help of friends, and $175,000 of our own money.  We're past the halfway point in construction.  Now begins Phase 2:  well, septic, roof completion, doors and windows, waterproofing, and habitat restoration.  Many of these elements are things we can't do ourselves (we don't know how to drill a 250' deep well!).  We need $80,000 for this phase, and that's the challenge:  because we're self-employed people building an innovative home, we can't get a bank loan to complete the project.  That's why we're turning to you.</p>

<h3>Vagrant Soles Apparel</h3>
<h3><strong>The Basiczzz</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Hello, indies!  The name's Matt Meneely.  I'm a 23 year old bachelor stuck at a major crossroads in my life.  ""Do what makes you happy, and you'll never work a day in your life.""  This was the quote I constantly heard from my overstressed and overworked father.  Now that I am faced with 2 different roads, ""safe career"" and my passion, he's suddenly forgotten his simple quote.<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>My goal is to prove his quote right.  While I have a decent job for my age, which does stress me out, I don't wake up in the morning with any sort of ambition or drive.  Monotony has become my middle name.  </strong></p>
<p><strong>Ever since I was a kid, most of my time was spent on a skateboard or my bike.  I built trails behind my elementary school to pass the time.  My love for BMX ignited when the neighboring city of Evansville built a skatepark called ""Lamasco.""  Initially banning bikes, after the city quit caring about the ""degenerates"" and ""delinquints"" who frequently inhabited it, bikes started creeping in.  That's when the real passion took aflame.  <br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Fairly recent edit of me and some buddies. Older ones on the same dudes vimeo profile.   <a href=""http://vimeo.com/24809718"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://vimeo.com/24809718</a><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>I was attracted to the comradery and constant progression that I found within the skatepark environment. The heavy hitters who I looked up to seemed to live a fast lifestyle,  which was always appealing to me.  With the retirement age growing by the year, why not live for now?  This is what I plan to embody with my company.<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Anyways, I went to college and studied psychology for three years, but was burned out with all the papers and partying (Death to MLA and APA Formats!!!).  I was luckily accepted as a union electrician which has sustained me for the past 2 years.  <br/></strong></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Get to the Point!! </h3>
<p>My campaign, Vagrant Soles (VGNT), is a way for me to put my ""two cents"" into the fashion world, and therefore social world, about the issues I find within it.  I am an overly cynical and paranoid young man who sees a lot of wrong in today's existence.  Why?  I'm not sure, as I had a magical and bright upbringing.  I plan to show the world the darker side that is commonly overlooked, in hopes of connecting to those who agree with my idea of what is really important in life and to create products that are deeper than fabric and print.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>But the campaign's called Vagrant ""Soles."" What about the shoes?! </h3>
<p>Good question!  The original idea was to produce a simple and light bmx/skate/casual shoe that likeminded ""shredders"" want to wear.<br/>So I did what I could and got a prototype made.  I've been shredding on them for 2 months.  The reason I'm not trying to sell them yet is that there are some changes that need to be made, and I want to offer the best product to the consumer, which will take some time.  But they do shred damn well!</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>You keep using the term ""shred."" Please elaborate.</h3>
<p>Well when someone asks me to define ""shred,"" I refer to the Spongebob episode where Spongebob tries to explain ""FUN"" to fuddyduddy Plankton.  It's rather difficult but here's my attempt at it.  Shredding basically means doing what you're passionate about and doing it well, be it bmx, skateboarding, painting, piano, guitar, or whatever and consistently doing what you can to progress!  Obviously my shoes will be designed with the BMX/skateboarder in mind, which also means they will hold up for less ""foot-intensive"" activities.  My hope is that the Vagrant Soles message will appeal to those who have a burning love for their hobby and a desire to keep getting better.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>That's all fine and dandy, but why should I buy your merch?</h3>
<p>Why should you buy my merch? Hmmm. </p>
<p>I am a man of my word, and while I can't boast my creddentials over the internet, I can hope to establish a trust with interested consumers.</p>
<p>The ""trust"" being the fact that I will do what I can to deliver durable, functional, and sweet looking products to my fellow shredders.  For now, the prices are higher than I had hoped, but will be cheaper once bulk orders are necessary and I have master the ""Logistics Monster."" </p>
<p>Nowadays, lack of trust is a major issue of today's world that I hope to combat.  Too damn cut-throat!</p>
<p>Supporting Vagrant Soles will also support the up-and-comers of the shred community.  I plan generate extensive exposure for those who rock my products.  This will help others to try and live the same type of life I want to live.  I support the underdogs.</p>
<p>I want to create a successful company which will give me time to work on my shredder hobbies.  Aside from bmx, my main creative hobbies are photography and music production.  I am depressed when I am trapped in a noncreative lifestlye, and I'm sure most would feel the same. </p>
<p>Supporting this campaign would be mega sweet.  </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What are your future goals for Vagrant Soles?</h3>
<p>I have many, I am a dreamer through and through.</p>
<p><strong>My first goal</strong> would be to establish myself as a credible merchant of awesome products.  This is a huge part of what this company will be about.  While the products are simple, this will be a ""watch us grow"" company.  I'm calling the first releases the ""1st Gen"" products.  With more funds and exposure, I can design more radical and complex designs to keep the shred moving!</p>
<p><strong>My second goal</strong> with this company is to try my hand in the high competition shoe market.  I sincerely believe if people knew the ideaology behind the company, they will give the kicks a try and love them.  While the shirt/whatever designs will become better with complexity, I want to keep the shoes simple.  Many shoes I see are way too flashy/flamboyent for my taste, and hopefully others (hopefully a niche market). <br/>Again, this goal will take some time.</p>
<p><strong>The third goal</strong> would be to create a fully automated and problem-free customer experience so as to give me more time to explore my creative vibes, thus improving future products.  I want to go completely mobile, with a murdered-out Hurse, some Vagrant Soles products, my camera, and like two pairs of clothes and meet others who share my passion.  I feel cluttered with my possessions, and want to break free of them!</p>
<p><strong>My fourth goal</strong> would be to get into the the female market.  I love the ladies, and they look super sexy in the right clothes.  My hopes are to make women at least 40% of my market (kind of a stretch given my company image).  I hope I can find a cute little thing that likes me well enough to model my stuff, and maybe grab a bite. ;)</p>
<p><strong>My fifth goal</strong> is to bring followers a behind the scenes look at my life and the company.  I have a huge hard-on for documentaries, and have many dreams of making some sweet unadulterated documentaries showcasing some radical individuals.</p>
<p><strong>My sixth goal</strong>, and ultimate goal (hints the company name), is to donate time and products to those in need.  I was scheming up a way to go to an orphanage and donate my kicks.  Sounds like a PR move, while it would be beneficial to the company, it would be deeper than what it appears.  Childrens' Homes, I believe they are called now, foster children who grow up with the idea that they are less valuable than other members of society.  Growing up with this mentality will undoubtedly create a self-fulfilling prophecy for them (hopefully this doesn't happen and more civil service is being done to avoid this).  My dream is to have a ""shred event"" for these children, giving them my shoes, my time and entertainment.  The entertainment being some buddies of mine who happen to work for a major BMX distributor who also happen to have ramps for such occasions to ""jump"" around and get them excited about the sport.  I feel that just by showing people care about what happens to these children, could ultimately change their path in life for the better.  The more successful this company becomes, the more ""underdogs"" I can help.  <strong>Imagine how rewarding it would be to know you've changed multiple lives of kids for the better!  </strong> Extremely rewarding.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Ok, now what about the perkzz?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Perk 1: $1-7 Help the Cause</strong></p>
<p>You and I obviously think alike, which is a huge booster for this company.  I will hope to one day run into you and buy you a soda!  I will be thinking of you!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Perk 2: $8- The Vagrant Soles Koozie</strong></p>
<p>Simple and lightweight koozie to keep your shredhands warm, and you're ""soda"" cold! Drink with a purpose.  Shipping included.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Perk 3: $16- VGNT Blinders</strong></p>
<p>One pair of simple and lightweight shred shades to ward off the non-shredders!<br/>Shipping included.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Perk 4:  $30- The First Vagrant Tee!</strong></p>
<p>Sweet VGNT shirt to look sexy while you shred and to support the shred movement!<br/>Will ask for sizes after the 30 days has reached an end.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Perk 5:  $52- Shred Blood Cell Count Bundlezz</strong></p>
<p>You will receive the aforementioned products to ensure that the shred will continue.  The complete first gen set that will start the shredder empire!  Will ask for sizes after the 30 days has reached an end.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Perk 6: $1000- He Did What?!</strong></p>
<p><br/>You will receive the aforementioned products to ensure that the shred will continue. IN ADDITION I will personally visit you to solve the problems of the world, talk about the company, attempt to teach you how to barspin, as well as vacuum 1 room in your home of your choosing.  Vacuum must be provided and please dont live in Alaska or Hawaii.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Expected delivery seems far off, but I hope to get the products to you sooner.  I'm just using the date as a cushion.</p>
<p>New to this website but I hope to find some of your sweet campaigns to help fund!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>NOTE: If you for some reason aren't completely on the same page as Vagrant Soles, but are curious about it, generate some talk! VGNT will take all the word of mouth we can get!  The weirder the better!  <strong>SPREAD THE SHRED!  Oh and use the indiegogo share tools!  I'll give you an imaginary french kiss!</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3>Final Words of Wisdom</h3>
<p>I want to become a man of the people.  Any advice/questions/concerns/ideas are openly accepted and appreciated.  If you are reading this, you have either read this entire post, or skimmed it.  Either way, you have my sincere thanks.</p>

Ever since I was a kid, most of my time was spent on a skateboard or my bike.  I built trails behind my elementary school to pass the time.  My love for BMX ignited when the neighboring city of Evansville built a skatepark called ""Lamasco.""  Initially banning bikes, after the city quit caring about the ""degenerates"" and ""delinquints"" who frequently inhabited it, bikes started creeping in.  That's when the real passion took aflame.  
Fairly recent edit of me and some buddies. Older ones on the same dudes vimeo profile.   http://vimeo.com/24809718
I was attracted to the comradery and constant progression that I found within the skatepark environment. The heavy hitters who I looked up to seemed to live a fast lifestyle,  which was always appealing to me.  With the retirement age growing by the year, why not live for now?  This is what I plan to embody with my company.
Anyways, I went to college and studied psychology for three years, but was burned out with all the papers and partying (Death to MLA and APA Formats!!!).  I was luckily accepted as a union electrician which has sustained me for the past 2 years.  
 
Get to the Point!! 
My campaign, Vagrant Soles (VGNT), is a way for me to put my ""two cents"" into the fashion world, and therefore social world, about the issues I find within it.  I am an overly cynical and paranoid young man who sees a lot of wrong in today's existence.  Why?  I'm not sure, as I had a magical and bright upbringing.  I plan to show the world the darker side that is commonly overlooked, in hopes of connecting to those who agree with my idea of what is really important in life and to create products that are deeper than fabric and print.
 
But the campaign's called Vagrant ""Soles."" What about the shoes?! 
Good question!  The original idea was to produce a simple and light bmx/skate/casual shoe that likeminded ""shredders"" want to wear.So I did what I could and got a prototype made.  I've been shredding on them for 2 months.  The reason I'm not trying to sell them yet is that there are some changes that need to be made, and I want to offer the best product to the consumer, which will take some time.  But they do shred damn well!
 
You keep using the term ""shred."" Please elaborate.
Well when someone asks me to define ""shred,"" I refer to the Spongebob episode where Spongebob tries to explain ""FUN"" to fuddyduddy Plankton.  It's rather difficult but here's my attempt at it.  Shredding basically means doing what you're passionate about and doing it well, be it bmx, skateboarding, painting, piano, guitar, or whatever and consistently doing what you can to progress!  Obviously my shoes will be designed with the BMX/skateboarder in mind, which also means they will hold up for less ""foot-intensive"" activities.  My hope is that the Vagrant Soles message will appeal to those who have a burning love for their hobby and a desire to keep getting better.
 
That's all fine and dandy, but why should I buy your merch?
Why should you buy my merch? Hmmm. 
I am a man of my word, and while I can't boast my creddentials over the internet, I can hope to establish a trust with interested consumers.
The ""trust"" being the fact that I will do what I can to deliver durable, functional, and sweet looking products to my fellow shredders.  For now, the prices are higher than I had hoped, but will be cheaper once bulk orders are necessary and I have master the ""Logistics Monster."" 
Nowadays, lack of trust is a major issue of today's world that I hope to combat.  Too damn cut-throat!
Supporting Vagrant Soles will also support the up-and-comers of the shred community.  I plan generate extensive exposure for those who rock my products.  This will help others to try and live the same type of life I want to live.  I support the underdogs.
I want to create a successful company which will give me time to work on my shredder hobbies.  Aside from bmx, my main creative hobbies are photography and music production.  I am depressed when I am trapped in a noncreative lifestlye, and I'm sure most would feel the same. 
Supporting this campaign would be mega sweet.  
 
What are your future goals for Vagrant Soles?
I have many, I am a dreamer through and through.
My first goal would be to establish myself as a credible merchant of awesome products.  This is a huge part of what this company will be about.  While the products are simple, this will be a ""watch us grow"" company.  I'm calling the first releases the ""1st Gen"" products.  With more funds and exposure, I can design more radical and complex designs to keep the shred moving!
My second goal with this company is to try my hand in the high competition shoe market.  I sincerely believe if people knew the ideaology behind the company, they will give the kicks a try and love them.  While the shirt/whatever designs will become better with complexity, I want to keep the shoes simple.  Many shoes I see are way too flashy/flamboyent for my taste, and hopefully others (hopefully a niche market). Again, this goal will take some time.
The third goal would be to create a fully automated and problem-free customer experience so as to give me more time to explore my creative vibes, thus improving future products.  I want to go completely mobile, with a murdered-out Hurse, some Vagrant Soles products, my camera, and like two pairs of clothes and meet others who share my passion.  I feel cluttered with my possessions, and want to break free of them!
My fourth goal would be to get into the the female market.  I love the ladies, and they look super sexy in the right clothes.  My hopes are to make women at least 40% of my market (kind of a stretch given my company image).  I hope I can find a cute little thing that likes me well enough to model my stuff, and maybe grab a bite. ;)
My fifth goal is to bring followers a behind the scenes look at my life and the company.  I have a huge hard-on for documentaries, and have many dreams of making some sweet unadulterated documentaries showcasing some radical individuals.
My sixth goal, and ultimate goal (hints the company name), is to donate time and products to those in need.  I was scheming up a way to go to an orphanage and donate my kicks.  Sounds like a PR move, while it would be beneficial to the company, it would be deeper than what it appears.  Childrens' Homes, I believe they are called now, foster children who grow up with the idea that they are less valuable than other members of society.  Growing up with this mentality will undoubtedly create a self-fulfilling prophecy for them (hopefully this doesn't happen and more civil service is being done to avoid this).  My dream is to have a ""shred event"" for these children, giving them my shoes, my time and entertainment.  The entertainment being some buddies of mine who happen to work for a major BMX distributor who also happen to have ramps for such occasions to ""jump"" around and get them excited about the sport.  I feel that just by showing people care about what happens to these children, could ultimately change their path in life for the better.  The more successful this company becomes, the more ""underdogs"" I can help.  Imagine how rewarding it would be to know you've changed multiple lives of kids for the better!   Extremely rewarding.
 
 
Ok, now what about the perkzz?
 
Perk 1: $1-7 Help the Cause
You and I obviously think alike, which is a huge booster for this company.  I will hope to one day run into you and buy you a soda!  I will be thinking of you!

Perk 5:  $52- Shred Blood Cell Count Bundlezz
You will receive the aforementioned products to ensure that the shred will continue.  The complete first gen set that will start the shredder empire!  Will ask for sizes after the 30 days has reached an end.
 
Perk 6: $1000- He Did What?!
You will receive the aforementioned products to ensure that the shred will continue. IN ADDITION I will personally visit you to solve the problems of the world, talk about the company, attempt to teach you how to barspin, as well as vacuum 1 room in your home of your choosing.  Vacuum must be provided and please dont live in Alaska or Hawaii.
 
Expected delivery seems far off, but I hope to get the products to you sooner.  I'm just using the date as a cushion.
New to this website but I hope to find some of your sweet campaigns to help fund!
 
NOTE: If you for some reason aren't completely on the same page as Vagrant Soles, but are curious about it, generate some talk! VGNT will take all the word of mouth we can get!  The weirder the better!  SPREAD THE SHRED!  Oh and use the indiegogo share tools!  I'll give you an imaginary french kiss!
 
Final Words of Wisdom
I want to become a man of the people.  Any advice/questions/concerns/ideas are openly accepted and appreciated.  If you are reading this, you have either read this entire post, or skimmed it.  Either way, you have my sincere thanks.
Expect a video and some more images very shortly!
With much shredlove,
Matthew Meneely

<br/>And in whatever activity you love to participate in, these sunglasses can take your experience to the next level!<br/><br/>
The sunglass lenses we’ve created are revolutionary. 
They are a <b>brand-new</b> consumer

When we started
hearing people refer to these as “<i>Sunglasses on a Mission</i>” we liked it
because it describes our campaign <u>in the following three ways:</u><br/><br/>
#1: 
These <i><b>O4S</b></i> Sunglasses
boast a rich military and law enforcement pedigree.  In fact, for almost two decades our original
core Orion Optical Eyewear Filters are being utilized by <b>elite US Special Operations Forces on top secret </b>and other military missions.  The military version has been battle tested
by military and law enforcement personnel, and the patented vision technology

“Who
Else Wants to Support the Mission to Create the World’s Greatest Eyewear [and
receive these totally awesome sunglasses for your help]?”
 

             ""Not all Sunglasses               are Created Equal!""

(You’re about to discover how the ""Orion4Sight Sunglasses on a Mission"" deliver
unrivaled vision performance.)Are you a cyclist?  A runner?  A fisherman?  A hunter?  A hiker?   A skiier?  A golfer?  A pilot?  A basketball, baseball or softball player? Actually, if you are active in any way and you want to improve your performance, these sunglasses are for YOU!Poor
quality and ordinary sunglasses are so common that most people don’t even know
how bad their sunglasses are.  Though
many sunglasses look alike, there are big differences in performance.  If you would like to have an entirely new
vision experience with sunglasses like you’ve never seen before, this will be
one of the most exciting messages you’ve ever read.  (It is in fact the Orion4Sight company's mission to create
the world’s greatest Eyewear).  What is this project about, and why should
you support it?  

Some may think our
mission to create the world’s greatest Eyewear is crazy.  But we don’t agree. In fact, we’ve already created the greatest sunglass
lenses available on the planet.  And with
your help, this is just the beginning.
And in whatever activity you love to participate in, these sunglasses can take your experience to the next level!
The sunglass lenses we’ve created are revolutionary. 
They are a brand-new consumer
spin-off version of patented vision technology that is being used by elite US Military Special Force Commands today.  You can only get this new spin-off technology
from Orion4Sight Ltd. – we invented
it – and the technology today is protected under our closely guarded trade
secrets.



                                            Military version of the Eyewear
displayed in photo above
For years
the inventor of this technology (his name is Kirk Kreutzig) has been asked to
develop a consumer version of the Military Eyewear of his creation.  After years of development, an earlier crowd-funding campaign got us started by helping to fund this new consumer version.  We now have a limited stock remaining to offer as a perk in this campaign (see the list
of perks on the right of this screen).You can get a pair of these sunglasses with unmatched lens technology, and enjoy them in any sport or activity of your choice!  You'll see things more clearly.  Everything will look more crisp.  You'll have a more enjoyable experience through an enhanced vision experience.
An Exciting New Vision Technology
When you look through our newly
developed sunglasses the world looks
different, better, more vivid, more clear, and more beautiful!  In fact, you will even notice things you never saw
before.

We are asking for your support to advance
new lines of Eyewear that will utilize the
Orion4Sight vision technologies (“O4S”).  We are excited to be able to provide the
finest Eyewear on the planet, driven with this technology.
        
This man is wearing the new Orion4Sight sunglasses we are offering as a perk in this campaign.
Why are people calling these “Sunglasses on a Mission”?

When we started
hearing people refer to these as “Sunglasses on a Mission” we liked it
because it describes our campaign in the following three ways:
#1: 
These O4S Sunglasses
boast a rich military and law enforcement pedigree.  In fact, for almost two decades our original
core Orion Optical Eyewear Filters are being utilized by elite US Special Operations Forces on top secret and other military missions.  The military version has been battle tested
by military and law enforcement personnel, and the patented vision technology
has literally helped save lives of many who serve.  Hence, calling our brand-new consumer
spin-off version “Sunglasses on a
Mission” is perfect.

                                Soldier wearing the Military version of the Orion Optical Eyewear Filters
#2:  Because
of the military heritage of these Sunglasses, we are donating 5% of the money
raised in this Indiegogo campaign to the Special
Operations Warrior Foundation, a remarkable charity serving the
families of fallen military personnel (providing college education funds and
more for kids of fallen soldiers). We are honored that our Orion4Sight sunglasses are helping
to advance the Mission of this
charity as well.
#3: 
The third reason Sunglasses on a
Mission is an appropriate title is that we have a Mission to create the best line of consumer eyewear on the planet, incorporating our vision
technology into new Orion4Sight consumer eyewear.  (But we can’t achieve this epic Mission
without your help.)
             
Why We Need Your Support 
We’ve developed a truly remarkable pair of sunglasses, but we’re just at the
beginning of what Orion4Sight will
become.  Your support on Indiegogo today
will help us accelerate our development and the creation of additional
product lines (including custom high-performance Ski Goggles and high
performance fashion eyewear).  Understandably,
improving and expanding our product line will take additional funding, R&D
and time.  So we thank you in advance for
supporting this campaign and our troops.                   Extensive Research
The original Spectrum Technologies products are Patented for their ability to improve human vision under extreme lighting conditions. The “Vision Transferability” is corroborated Research Papers conducted by the US Navy, Army, and Air Force.
Your ORION4Sight spin-off Eyewear integrates many of the vision Technologies used by elite US Special Operation Commands, including many Law Enforcement Agencies.
Here’s a Big Perk for Your Support
You can get a pair of these
Orion4Sight Sunglasses on a Mission sent
to you shortly after the end of the campaign.  
Because you’ll be helping us with our mission to create a line of Eyewear
that’s best on the planet (and because you’ll be helping advance the mission of
the Special Operations Warrior
Foundation as well), you can be rewarded with this amazing Eyewear soon.  Everyone wins when you support this campaign
today!
(And when you receive your sunglasses, you'll be out cycling or running or hiking or hunting or fishing or shooting hoops or playing softball or driving or golfing or working in the yard or whatever your chosen sport or activity...in awesome comfort and style!)
The original retail price for these sunglasses is $195.00.  We have a limited number available after the close of this campaign, and you can now receive a pair for your support of just $105. 
They will never be offered for less than you find in this campaign, and you can get them sent to you at the end of August.  


The O4S Sunglasses on a Mission
are sleek wraparounds, and when you receive them they’ll be tucked into a white
microfiber cleaning bag inside of a rugged protective case (see photo).  Included is a set of Eyewear Instructions
that explain correct usage of the Eyewear so you can achieve maximum visual
benefits.

Sunglasses have unisex frames, and look great on men and women in all seasons of the year.Now that you’ve discovered this remarkable Eyewear, you may begin to notice very
cool people already wearing the O4S Sunglasses while performing on stage, in sporting
events, or on TV.  And speaking of cool people, the fact we are raising money to help the
Special Operations Warrior Foundation
is a special part of this campaign as well.

It’s not just the ultra-soft Supima® cotton fabrics, luxurious feel, and simple yet elegant menswear-inspired design that makes our sleepwear shine--it’s what they do when you buy them. For every purchase, we donate to a woman in need. And you’ll sleep better, too!When we learned that pajamas are one of the most requested clothing items at domestic violence shelters, we knew we had to do something. So we started a company, designed the world’s best pajamas, and put together a plan to use their popularity to help those  in need. Now we’re using our Indiegogo campaign to kick off our initial production run to get it all rolling. No matter how advanced an apparel technology is, if it doesn't look good, now one will wear it.  That's why our pajamas are beautifully designed with an amazing fit. Our pajamas are timeless, with a classic menswear-inspired silhouette. Whether you're snuggling up in bed to an addictive read or watching Netflix with friends, these timeless pajamas will have you feeling chic and sexy (while still comfy) at the end of the day.Grown exclusively in the southwestern United States, Supima® is a rare form of cotton that is softer, finer, and more durable than regular cotton. This extra long staple cotton is also natural and breathable. Supima regulates body temperature so you get a ‘cool’ sleep on warm nights and a ‘warm’ sleep on cool nights for year-round comfort. The extra long-staple also gives Supima® the luster of silk and the luxuriously soft feel of cashmere. Try our pajamas once and you'll never sleep in anything else again.The best quality comes when you make things at home. We aren’t another company that goes overseas to manufacture simply because it is cheaper to do so. We see a better way. We’re adopting technology to manufacture in small batches here at home; we’re setting up shop in the U.S and reinvesting our profits into job training programs that support economic development in our community.Parker Gray is driven by a mission to develop products that improve lives. The concept is simple: for every purchase, Parker Gray will donate to those in need – in other words “buy one, give one.” The popularity of the one-for-one concept has been proven by companies like TOMS shoes, Warby Parker eyeglasses and Bombas socks.After decades of complacency in the sleepwear industry, we’re giving pajamas a much-needed makeover.  Made with smart fabrics, advanced construction and manufactured locally, Parker Gray pajamas are created to be so comfortable that you’ll never want to take them off—and so practical, that you don’t need to.Inspired by the classic 20th century menswear pajamas, we set out to design a timeless and stylish collection with a modern twist.Parker Gray was founded by a group of apparel industry veterans who believe there is a better way to make pajamas. Our team shares a passion for creating beautifully designed products that improve lives.To create the world’s best pajamas we started from scratch. No details were overlooked: from the superior pima cotton fabric to the reinforced shell buttons, and from the grosgrain drawstring to the satin piping, we designed our sleepwear to be both pretty and practical, with a polished look and a flattering fit.Like coffee, cashmere or fine wine, the quality of cotton can vary greatly. We’re on Indiegogo to raise funds to purchase materials and get into the initial production run. Your backing will help us position Parker Gray for success, allow us to retrain U. S. workers for better jobs and create a brighter future for women who need your support.  We’ve teamed up with nearly a dozen nonprofit organizations - great folks like Mom’s Pajamas and Shelter House - who will serve as our Giving Partners and distribute our pajamas to shelters in their communities.Our pajamas are designed for extreme leisure, with soothing, tranquil colors that promote relaxation and encourage more restful sleep.
