<p><i>Aww, Feathers!</i> is a family friendly, anthropomorphic, slice-of-life webcomic that I began in May, 2014.  Now I'm excited for the chance to release the first year of comic pages in print form!  I've already got a proof made, and it looks awesome!  All it needs now is your support.</p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h2>Funding Goals</h2> <p>Since this is my first rodeo, I've kept the initial funding goal small.  Luckily, the print service I'm using (Ka-blam) will print as many or as few copies as I need, so even if we don't reach that goal, I'll still be able to send a copy to all the backers who paid for one.  However, if we do reach our funding goal or any of the stretch goals, there are a few extras that can be added as well!</p>
<h4><b><u>REACHED!  $500 - Dil's Prank</u></b></h4>

<p>That's right!  Dil's got an embarrassing photo of Ine (currently in a safe place where Ine will never find it!)  and if this initial funding goal is reached, he'll paste it in the back of each copy of the book!  (Don't worry, it's nothing inappropriate.  All in good fun!)</p>
<h4><b><u><h4>
<b><u>REACHED!  </u></b><b style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: initial;""><u>$600 - Backers Q&amp;A Page</u></b>
</h4></u></b></h4>
<p>For this first stretch goal, all backers will get the chance to submit their questions to the characters in the comic, who will pick and answer them on an exclusive Backers Q&amp;A Page that will be added to the book!  This will be similar to the recent character Q&amp;A pages on the website (<a href=""http://www.awwfeathers.com/comics/2136454/2015-reader-q-a-3/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">like this one</a>) but we'll arrange them so more can fit on the page.</p>
<h4><b><u>$750 - 1 Page Bonus Story</u></b></h4>
<p>At this funding level, an extra story will be added to the book!  In addition, all backers will get the opportunity to vote on which character this bonus story will focus on.  Want to see more of a main character like Ine, Dil, June, or Mally?  Or maybe you'd like to learn more about one of the secondary characters, like Bishop Reyes or Ine's brother, Mark?  Or even a sneak peek at a new character who's planned for a future chapter but hasn't appeared in the webcomic yet!  Whoever the backers choose, an exclusive one page story about them will be added to the book.  Want more than one page?  Well...</p>
<h4><b><u>$1,000 - 3 Page Bonus Story</u></b></h4>
<p>...at this next level the bonus story that was unlocked will be expanded to three pages!  Still not enough?  Hmm...</p>
<h4><b><u>$1,500 - 5 Page Bonus Story</u></b></h4>
<p>Then how about <i>five</i> pages!  The character chosen by the backers will get an entire chapter of new material!  Phew... that's going to be about as much as I can handle before sending the final version of the book off to be printed.  But what if we surpass even <i>this</i> lofty goal?</p>
<h4><b><u>$3,000 - Holiday Bonus</u></b></h4>
<p>Now we're getting <i>real</i> ambitious!  If we reach this stretch goal, then during the month of December 2015, the webcomic will update <i>twice a week</i> instead of just once!  And I don't mean one main page and one teensy bonus comic.  I mean two full pages of the main story!</p>
<h4><b><u>$5,000 - Extended Holiday!</u></b></h4>
<p>Hey, you gotta dream big, am I right?  A month of double updates is great, but what about <i>two months</i>!!  If this level is reached, the webcomic will update twice a week during December 2015 <i>and</i> January 2016!</p>

<div>
<h2>Q &amp; A</h2>
<div>
<b>Q: What's the premise of the comic?</b><br/>A: <i>Aww, Feathers!</i> is a slice-of-life comic, meaning it shares everyday experiences from the lives of the characters. It features a variety of characters, all based on animals, and follows their life through college and beyond. The tone is meant to be light-hearted and often humorous, but occasionally serious and thought-provoking.</div>
<div>
<b>Q: Is this comic family friendly?</b><br/>A: Yes! While the intended audience is probably teen and up, my goal is for the entire comic series to be safe for anyone to enjoy. It's rated SFW (Safe For Work) or probably about a PG rating.</div>
<div>
<b>Q: Is this an LDS comic?</b><br/>A: Not exclusively. I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (aka ""Mormon"" or ""LDS""), and frequent mention is made of the Church and Mormon culture. Several characters are members of the Church, and it is a very large part of their lives. However, not every story arc deals with LDS or even religious topics, and overall the comic is intended for a general audience. Mormon or not, religious or not, I think everyone can find something they can relate to.</div>
<div><b style=""background-color: initial;""></b></div>
<b>Q: Why animal characters instead of humans?</b><br/>A: There are a few reasons. I like animals and they're fun to draw. And with a nearly endless variety to choose from, coming up with new and unique characters is also easier and lots of fun. But it's also somewhat of an analogy. Many of the characters are so different in species. Sometimes this causes tension or awkwardness, but often they learn to get along. Shouldn't we be the same?<div></div>
</div>
<div>
<b>Q: Are the stories based on real events?</b><br/>A: Many of them are. In fact, quite a few of the story arcs are based on my own personal experiences. A lot of the details are different however and some of the events are entirely fictional or only loosely based on reality.<br/>
</div>
<div>
<b>Q: What are the dimensions of the printed version?</b><br/>A: The book measures 7"" x 10.5"" and is currently 68 pages. Depending on what stretch goals are met however, a few more pages may be added.<br/>
</div>
<div>
<b>Q: Will any of the bonus material ever be posted online?</b><br/>A: Maybe someday, but if so it won't be until at least a year after the book's release.<br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>

</li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;""><u>Cameo Appearance</u> - By choosing this option, you assert that you own the rights to the character making the appearance, and you maintain the rights to that character, but grant me permission to include the page he/she appears in both online and in any future printed versions.  After the initial cameo appearance, your character will not be used in any other way without first obtaining your permission.  In order to fit with the established world of the comic, minor adjustments may need to be made to the character (colors, relative size, or placement of wings or other appendages for example), but I will seek your input before making any such adjustments.</span></li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;""><u>Help Design a Character</u> - While you may pick certain aspects of a character's appearance and personality, the resulting character will remain the intellectual property of <i>Aww, Feathers!</i>, meaning he/she may be used online and in print at my discretion.  Therefore, by choosing this option you agree not to attempt to recreate any character belonging to you or someone else.  Character ideas that appear similar to already existing characters may not be accepted.  (If you really want to see <i>your</i> character appear in the comic, consider the Cameo Appearance option.)<br/></span></li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;""><u>Help Write a Chapter</u> - As always, all story ideas must be family friendly.  In addition, to maintain the integrity of the story so far as well as future plans for the story, certain ideas may not be accepted.  These may include, but are not limited to, major changes in a character's personality, interests, relationships, or general role in the story.  However, if for any reason an idea is not suitable, I'll communicate with you about what can be changed until we have an idea that works.</span></li>

Q & A

Q: What's the premise of the comic?A: Aww, Feathers! is a slice-of-life comic, meaning it shares everyday experiences from the lives of the characters. It features a variety of characters, all based on animals, and follows their life through college and beyond. The tone is meant to be light-hearted and often humorous, but occasionally serious and thought-provoking.

Q: Is this comic family friendly?A: Yes! While the intended audience is probably teen and up, my goal is for the entire comic series to be safe for anyone to enjoy. It's rated SFW (Safe For Work) or probably about a PG rating.

Q: Is this an LDS comic?A: Not exclusively. I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (aka ""Mormon"" or ""LDS""), and frequent mention is made of the Church and Mormon culture. Several characters are members of the Church, and it is a very large part of their lives. However, not every story arc deals with LDS or even religious topics, and overall the comic is intended for a general audience. Mormon or not, religious or not, I think everyone can find something they can relate to.

Q: Why animal characters instead of humans?A: There are a few reasons. I like animals and they're fun to draw. And with a nearly endless variety to choose from, coming up with new and unique characters is also easier and lots of fun. But it's also somewhat of an analogy. Many of the characters are so different in species. Sometimes this causes tension or awkwardness, but often they learn to get along. Shouldn't we be the same?


Q: Are the stories based on real events?A: Many of them are. In fact, quite a few of the story arcs are based on my own personal experiences. A lot of the details are different however and some of the events are entirely fictional or only loosely based on reality.


Q: What are the dimensions of the printed version?A: The book measures 7"" x 10.5"" and is currently 68 pages. Depending on what stretch goals are met however, a few more pages may be added.


Q: Will any of the bonus material ever be posted online?A: Maybe someday, but if so it won't be until at least a year after the book's release.

Imagine
turning 87 years old and your ship is finally coming in!  Well, in creating what has been described as the
world’s first graphic novel,  <i>“The First
Kingdom”</i> – which took me fifteen years with over 1,070 fully illustrated pages plus
covers, and now published in its entirety – my first big ocean liner has finally
come to port.   But it
takes time for the royalties to roll in. 
 And here I am, without the means
to create my next magnum opus, a new graphic novel called <i>“Beyond the Beyond.” </i> It’s
been 40 years since the start of my graphic novel journey – and now I’m asking
for your help and support so that I can have the means to create and complete the first half of the Introduction of “Beyond the Beyond,"" which will be the first 65 fully
illustrated pages of this new project.  The
good news is that my new ship has left port and set sail – I have begun the
project already and will explain more about it below.   
<p>I
have a wonderful Team who want to help me produce this project, so they offered
to help organize this IndieGoGo.com site and reach out.  We have thought up
some nice thank you’s for your kind contributions and the Team will make sure
that they reach you.  We sincerely
appreciate you spreading the word among people you think might like to view my
story on this site.</p><p></p><p><b><i>So how long is this new Project going to take?</i></b></p>
<p>I’ve already written the entire outline for <i>“Beyond the Beyond” </i>and started to draw it.  I don’t work like anyone else I know.  I do one page at a time, in narrative
sequence.  I write it, pencil it and ink
it all myself.  Rarely do I use any
reference in drawing, these visuals just go straight from my mind to the
paper.  It takes one to three days to
produce a completed page.  Originally <i>“Beyond the Beyond”</i> was going to be over
1,700 pages.  I sat down with my exceptional literary agent, Peter Beren, to share my idea. 
He said, “You’re 87 years old.  Do
the math.  If we can do the math, so can
the publishers.  This will take too many
years.”  </p><p>So now my goal is to telescope
this graphic novel into 800 fully illustrated pages; and I assure you, it is achievable and my
agent believes in the project.  The
illustrations are not as elaborate as you saw in <i>“The First
 Kingdom.”</i>  This new style I’m working in is more refined
and more story driven.  I have completed
34 pages so far and I’m able to keep up the pace and achieve a very consistent
style of graphical story telling.   Yet it’s some of the best drawing I’ve ever
done;  here are several of the early pages, minus some of the text at the page top.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p>                                               <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1079177/files/20141207210152-beyond_the_beyond_page_18.jpg?1418014912"" src="""" style=""width: 287.809941520468px;height: 383px;""/>   </p><p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><br/></span></p><p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">     </span><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1079179/files/20141207210323-beyond_the_beyond_page_21.jpg?1418015003"" src="""" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;width: 276.01108033241px;height: 376px;background-color: initial;""/><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">         </span><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1079184/files/20141207210642-beyond_the_beyond_page_33.jpg?1418015202"" src="""" style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;width: 286.153846153846px;height: 360px;background-color: initial;""/><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">       </span><br/></p><p>

<p>Some
of you may know me from <i>“The First Kingdom."" </i>  It was the first independently produced
graphic novel, published by Bud Plant, who began publishing it in 1974 as I was
producing it.  But only now is it
reaching a world-wide audience because Titan Publishing, in the UK, has
recently published six hardcover volumes, including two never-before-released
installments, “<i>The Space Explorer’s Club</i>”
and “<i>Destiny</i>.”   Below are several of the pages so that you can
see the scope of this work.  <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">              </span></p><p></p><p>   <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1128610/files/20150103012140-TFK_coronation.jpg?1420276900"" src="""" style=""width: 316.402173913043px;height: 465px;cursor: nw-resize;""/>  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1130075/files/20150104001924-Chapter_10_CoverB_TheFirstKingdom_Katz.jpg?1420359564"" src="""" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;width: 260.392749244713px;height: 338px;background-color: initial;""/></p><p></p><p>     <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1129996/files/20150103235619-TFK1_1_Interiors_3_2.jpg.size-600.jpg?1420358179"" src="""" style=""width: 264.351648351648px;height: 388px;""/>   <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1129998/files/20150103235719-FirstKingdom-vol4-pg5.jpg.size-600.jpg?1420358239"" src="""" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;width: 318.766066838046px;height: 400px;background-color: initial;""/></p><p>
I’ve been credited with contributing to the “graphic novel” and “space
opera” genres.  I consider graphic novels
to be fully illustrated books for adults, a means of mature expression just
like movies, novels or music.  Space
opera is a subgenre of science fiction that often emphasizes romantic
adventure, set mainly or entirely in outer space.  Below is a very short video which conveys a glimpse of these concepts through visuals and music arranged by Titan Publishing. <br/></p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Fmwo1adEL5C0%3Ffeature%3Doembed%26rel%3D0&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dmwo1adEL5C0&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fmwo1adEL5C0%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><p></p><p>The color images below were from covers on the first soft cover editions of the first 24 chapters.

age five by artists like Hal Foster (Tarzan
and Prince Valiant) and Alex
Raymond (Flash Gordon).  I
knew them.  In fact, at age 13, I went to the Society of Illustrators
where Alex Raymond lectured.  At age 19, I met Hal Foster while I was
working at King Features.  I mentioned my ideas for <i>“The First Kingdom” </i>and I asked them if it was possible to
use this new medium of expression to convey my story.  They essentially
said, “Well, nobody has done it before, but go ahead with my blessing.”
 So in 1973, I took the idea for my graphic novel, <i>“The First Kingdom,”  </i>which was fully formed in my mind
since I was 12 years old, and I started transferring it from my mind to
paper. </p><p></p><p>                                 <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1186905/files/20150131160133-DSCF0603.JPG?1422748893"" src="""" style=""width: 363.201754385965px;height: 245px;""/></p><p>Some of you may also know me from my career as a

my professional career began at age 15.  When
I worked for companies like Atlas, Timely, Standard, DC, Marvel, King Features,
etc. it was a factory.  It was all “work
for hire.”  There were people literally
passing out at their drawing boards trying to meet their deadlines.  When that happened, we helped each other.  I did a lot of “ghosting” (some with
pseudonyms) on everything from “Archie” to “Popeye,” horror stories, you name it.  And if one of the artists had a family crisis
or something, I helped them.  We all did
that.  We had to.  We weren’t making huge money.  We weren’t employees, we didn’t get paid for
overtime or get any benefits such as health or retirement…or anything, except
pay for hours worked.   The
companies owned all the artwork that was created, too.   That’s
just the way it was.  You made your
deadlines and you got to keep working.  You
were just glad to be working.  To give you an idea, below are images of a story I drew in the 50's; and an original Bulletman drawing.  You'll find these in the Rewards section of this site.<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">  </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;text-align: center;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">  </span><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1085654/files/20141210011912-HauntedHorror-12-IDM.jpg?1418203152"" src="""" style=""letter-spacing: 0px;text-align: center;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;width: 157.594142259414px;height: 243px;background-color: initial;""/><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">              </span><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1117957/files/20141226140214-Bride_of_Death.jpg?1419631334"" src="""" style=""letter-spacing: 0px;text-align: center;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;width: 168.040983606557px;height: 247px;background-color: initial;""/><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;text-align: center;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">       </span><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1144568/files/20150112013649-OML_jackkatz_Bulletlman_150.jpg?1421055409"" src="""" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;text-align: center;background-color: initial;""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">    </span></p><p>
One day, I was asked to draw a scene where the villain was beating up some
teenagers and I just put down my pencil and said, “That’s it, I’m not doing
this any more.”  That was one of the
pivotal moments in my career -- I just couldn’t do one more page of this type
of violence.</p>
<p>Now I had had this idea since age 12 that I could do <i>“The First Kingdom,”</i> as a preamble to <i>""Beyond the Beyond"" </i>on my own and somehow get it published.  It has an interweaving story of adventure, romance,
and science fiction interspersed with philosophy – it does depict battles, but there
is no graphic violence.   That was
my vision, to focus on the message and content for adults and to avoid mindless
violence; to evolve comics to a whole new concept.  And with the support of my wife Caroline, I
was able to spend the next thirteen years creating the first 24 chapters
(completed in 1986).   Then much later, I spent another two years
completing the final chapters which are the last two volumes of the hard cover
books.  

</p><p>Needless to say, those were lean years while I was creating <i>“The First Kingdom</i>.""  In all those years working for mainstream comics, followed by independent alternative publishing, and later painting, there was no way to establish a retirement fund.   This has been a 40-year sojourn since beginning <i>""The First Kingdom""</i> in 1974, finally to arrive at this place in time where the entire work has been published recently in six quality hardcover volumes by Titan.    I want to thank my agent, Peter Beren, and Titan Publisher Nick Landau and his talented staff, for having faith in <i>""The First Kingdom;""</i> and for their commitment to exceptional quality in reproduction and printing.  I feel proud of their presentation of my efforts and trust that as people learn of my graphic novel, eventually royalties will sustain me.  Also I want to take a minute here to thank again the people along the way who supported my vision in diverse ways, who are too many to acknowledge in this brief space.  </p><p><b><i>How is the money going to be spent?</i></b></p>
<p></p><p>Now at 87, I really don’t have any savings to fall back on.   As mentioned earlier, we believe the royalties
from sales will roll in eventually.   But it will take some time and right now, I
need your help to be able to do the work for<b> <i>“</i></b><i>Beyond the Beyond.""</i>   I have some income for basics from teaching
Figure Drawing once weekly for the local community and also a little Social
Security.  But to do the work for <i>“Beyond the Beyond,” </i>I need to dedicate
myself to sitting behind my drawing board 14+ hours on most days and have what
I need to write and draw this project.  There are necessities such as space rental<b>,</b> supplies such as Bristol board and
ink pens, and other logistics for getting this project ready to go to print.  </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>            <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1131502/files/20150104182052-Pie_Chart_new.jpg?1420424452"" src="""" style=""width: 531.428571428571px;height: 264px;""/></p><p></p><div>The campaign target goal would keep me going for at least three months.  Should the blessing of exceeding our funding goal occur, any extra funds will be used to keep the project going beyond this initial three months of support.  Our <i>""Beyond The Beyond""</i> Team will keep you informed of my progress along the way through this site (see “Updates” tab at top of this page).<br/><br/>Many thanks for taking the time to read my story.   I am blessed with excellent health and vitality, so can assure you of my commitment to a long life which involves producing this work with the very best quality of art and creative spirit that is within me.  I will truly appreciate any and every donation for this project.  I’m happy to thank you with gifts as mentioned on this site, and will allow time to produce sketches or sign &amp; date the gifts as indicated.  All proceeds will be used to enable me to work on this beginning phase of <i>“Beyond the Beyond,”</i>  and also, our budget includes fees and rewards expenses related to this outreach endeavor.

Imagine
turning 87 years old and your ship is finally coming in!  Well, in creating what has been described as the
world’s first graphic novel,  “The First
Kingdom” – which took me fifteen years with over 1,070 fully illustrated pages plus
covers, and now published in its entirety – my first big ocean liner has finally
come to port.   But it
takes time for the royalties to roll in. 
 And here I am, without the means
to create my next magnum opus, a new graphic novel called “Beyond the Beyond.”  It’s
been 40 years since the start of my graphic novel journey – and now I’m asking
for your help and support so that I can have the means to create and complete the first half of the Introduction of “Beyond the Beyond,"" which will be the first 65 fully
illustrated pages of this new project.  The
good news is that my new ship has left port and set sail – I have begun the
project already and will explain more about it below.   
I
have a wonderful Team who want to help me produce this project, so they offered
to help organize this IndieGoGo.com site and reach out.  We have thought up
some nice thank you’s for your kind contributions and the Team will make sure
that they reach you.  We sincerely
appreciate you spreading the word among people you think might like to view my
story on this site.So how long is this new Project going to take?
I’ve already written the entire outline for “Beyond the Beyond” and started to draw it.  I don’t work like anyone else I know.  I do one page at a time, in narrative
sequence.  I write it, pencil it and ink
it all myself.  Rarely do I use any
reference in drawing, these visuals just go straight from my mind to the
paper.  It takes one to three days to
produce a completed page.  Originally “Beyond the Beyond” was going to be over
1,700 pages.  I sat down with my exceptional literary agent, Peter Beren, to share my idea. 
He said, “You’re 87 years old.  Do
the math.  If we can do the math, so can
the publishers.  This will take too many
years.”  So now my goal is to telescope
this graphic novel into 800 fully illustrated pages; and I assure you, it is achievable and my
agent believes in the project.  The
illustrations are not as elaborate as you saw in “The First
 Kingdom.”  This new style I’m working in is more refined
and more story driven.  I have completed
34 pages so far and I’m able to keep up the pace and achieve a very consistent
style of graphical story telling.   Yet it’s some of the best drawing I’ve ever
done;  here are several of the early pages, minus some of the text at the page top.                                                                       
A Bit of Background ~
Graphic Novels and Space Operas
Some
of you may know me from “The First Kingdom.""   It was the first independently produced
graphic novel, published by Bud Plant, who began publishing it in 1974 as I was
producing it.  But only now is it
reaching a world-wide audience because Titan Publishing, in the UK, has
recently published six hardcover volumes, including two never-before-released
installments, “The Space Explorer’s Club”
and “Destiny.”   Below are several of the pages so that you can
see the scope of this work.                             
I’ve been credited with contributing to the “graphic novel” and “space
opera” genres.  I consider graphic novels
to be fully illustrated books for adults, a means of mature expression just
like movies, novels or music.  Space
opera is a subgenre of science fiction that often emphasizes romantic
adventure, set mainly or entirely in outer space.  Below is a very short video which conveys a glimpse of these concepts through visuals and music arranged by Titan Publishing. The color images below were from covers on the first soft cover editions of the first 24 chapters. (See my Facebook page ""TheFirstKingdom Jack Katz"" to view an album of more interior pages; and also all 48 color front and back covers, as well as credits to the colorists for each set.)                 I was certainly influenced since
age five by artists like Hal Foster (Tarzan
and Prince Valiant) and Alex
Raymond (Flash Gordon).  I
knew them.  In fact, at age 13, I went to the Society of Illustrators
where Alex Raymond lectured.  At age 19, I met Hal Foster while I was
working at King Features.  I mentioned my ideas for “The First Kingdom” and I asked them if it was possible to
use this new medium of expression to convey my story.  They essentially
said, “Well, nobody has done it before, but go ahead with my blessing.”
 So in 1973, I took the idea for my graphic novel, “The First Kingdom,”  which was fully formed in my mind
since I was 12 years old, and I started transferring it from my mind to
paper.                                  Some of you may also know me from my career as a
professional artist in the comics industry, from my paintings, or from taking
an art class with me.  If you want to know me better, at the bottom of
this page is a website link, www.jackatz.com, for details about my life and background;
 information about “The First Kingdom,” such as various reviews and
articles and how to find the books  (you may want to also visit www.thefirstkingdom.com);  images of my 200+ paintings;
 and listings of most of my prior works in the comics industry since my
start in the Silver Age.  The Gallery button (top menu) includes some
visuals of several Rewards items and other photos.  
No retirement fund for this Silver
Age Artist…                        Well, let me give you just a brief glimpse into my career as an artist;
my professional career began at age 15.  When
I worked for companies like Atlas, Timely, Standard, DC, Marvel, King Features,
etc. it was a factory.  It was all “work
for hire.”  There were people literally
passing out at their drawing boards trying to meet their deadlines.  When that happened, we helped each other.  I did a lot of “ghosting” (some with
pseudonyms) on everything from “Archie” to “Popeye,” horror stories, you name it.  And if one of the artists had a family crisis
or something, I helped them.  We all did
that.  We had to.  We weren’t making huge money.  We weren’t employees, we didn’t get paid for
overtime or get any benefits such as health or retirement…or anything, except
pay for hours worked.   The
companies owned all the artwork that was created, too.   That’s
just the way it was.  You made your
deadlines and you got to keep working.  You
were just glad to be working.  To give you an idea, below are images of a story I drew in the 50's; and an original Bulletman drawing.  You'll find these in the Rewards section of this site.                             
One day, I was asked to draw a scene where the villain was beating up some
teenagers and I just put down my pencil and said, “That’s it, I’m not doing
this any more.”  That was one of the
pivotal moments in my career -- I just couldn’t do one more page of this type
of violence.
Now I had had this idea since age 12 that I could do “The First Kingdom,” as a preamble to ""Beyond the Beyond"" on my own and somehow get it published.  It has an interweaving story of adventure, romance,
and science fiction interspersed with philosophy – it does depict battles, but there
is no graphic violence.   That was
my vision, to focus on the message and content for adults and to avoid mindless
violence; to evolve comics to a whole new concept.  And with the support of my wife Caroline, I
was able to spend the next thirteen years creating the first 24 chapters
(completed in 1986).   Then much later, I spent another two years
completing the final chapters which are the last two volumes of the hard cover
books.  

Needless to say, those were lean years while I was creating “The First Kingdom.""  In all those years working for mainstream comics, followed by independent alternative publishing, and later painting, there was no way to establish a retirement fund.   This has been a 40-year sojourn since beginning ""The First Kingdom"" in 1974, finally to arrive at this place in time where the entire work has been published recently in six quality hardcover volumes by Titan.    I want to thank my agent, Peter Beren, and Titan Publisher Nick Landau and his talented staff, for having faith in ""The First Kingdom;"" and for their commitment to exceptional quality in reproduction and printing.  I feel proud of their presentation of my efforts and trust that as people learn of my graphic novel, eventually royalties will sustain me.  Also I want to take a minute here to thank again the people along the way who supported my vision in diverse ways, who are too many to acknowledge in this brief space.  How is the money going to be spent?
Now at 87, I really don’t have any savings to fall back on.   As mentioned earlier, we believe the royalties
from sales will roll in eventually.   But it will take some time and right now, I
need your help to be able to do the work for “Beyond the Beyond.""   I have some income for basics from teaching
Figure Drawing once weekly for the local community and also a little Social
Security.  But to do the work for “Beyond the Beyond,” I need to dedicate
myself to sitting behind my drawing board 14+ hours on most days and have what
I need to write and draw this project.  There are necessities such as space rental, supplies such as Bristol board and
ink pens, and other logistics for getting this project ready to go to print.              The campaign target goal would keep me going for at least three months.  Should the blessing of exceeding our funding goal occur, any extra funds will be used to keep the project going beyond this initial three months of support.  Our ""Beyond The Beyond"" Team will keep you informed of my progress along the way through this site (see “Updates” tab at top of this page).Many thanks for taking the time to read my story.   I am blessed with excellent health and vitality, so can assure you of my commitment to a long life which involves producing this work with the very best quality of art and creative spirit that is within me.  I will truly appreciate any and every donation for this project.  I’m happy to thank you with gifts as mentioned on this site, and will allow time to produce sketches or sign & date the gifts as indicated.  All proceeds will be used to enable me to work on this beginning phase of “Beyond the Beyond,”  and also, our budget includes fees and rewards expenses related to this outreach endeavor. Thank you for your support, it means so much to me.

<p><b>The story </b></p>
<p>Aminoacid Boy is a
creature from outer space sent on Earth from his Lord, a
bio-architectural-metal-meat-machine living in a dark cave. He generates the
whole things in a chaotic way. Physical and mechanical laws drive the transformations
in his universe where equilibrium and chaotic states alternate without any
final aim.</p>

<p>The Lord discovers
that on planet Earth there are species whose individuals can find their own
reasons for living, they have desires and will. They are able to feel pain and
self-accomplishment. To Lord's eyes this is something extraordinary and
illogical. Amino is sent on Earth to understand the reason of this anomalous
behavior.</p>
<p>To accomplish his
mission, Amino has the power to assimilate the DNA from human and animal
species he gets in contact with. His DNA evolves and becomes more and more
similar to the one of those creatures. This way Amino should understand them
better. </p>

is not going to be alone on Earth. The Chaos Order will soon reach him. I

NEW AMINO BIG ILLUSTRATION  (200€) perk now available! 

During the last week
I've been working on the inside back
cover of the book. It is now available as a new perk:



Remember that NEW FULL PAGE ILLUSTRATION PERK (150€) is still available:

Short summary
I’m Diego
Lazzarin. Since 2005, I’ve been working in animation, illustration and
filmmaking. I realized short animation movies that have been screened
and awarded by national and international festivals. I also worked in
music videos. If you are interested in my works, you can have a look at my
website: www.diegolazzarin.com.



Aminoacid Boy and
the Chaos Order is a graphic novel I started more than three years ago. The book is made up of more
than 500 hand painted panels. The story develops throughout 7 chapters. An
additional section contains full-page illustrations (the Chaos Order chapter). Aminoacid Boy and the Chaos Order is 100% done… now that the graphic novel is ready, it's time to start crowdfunding!

The purpose of
this campaign is to raise enough money for a quality print run of the
book. So if the goal is met this is basically a preorder
event for the book. The campaign is fixed funding so, if the goal isn't
reached, all the money you paid will be automatically refunded to
you. Your contributions will help me to materialize three years of hard
work!

The story 
Aminoacid Boy is a
creature from outer space sent on Earth from his Lord, a
bio-architectural-metal-meat-machine living in a dark cave. He generates the
whole things in a chaotic way. Physical and mechanical laws drive the transformations
in his universe where equilibrium and chaotic states alternate without any
final aim.



The Lord discovers
that on planet Earth there are species whose individuals can find their own
reasons for living, they have desires and will. They are able to feel pain and
self-accomplishment. To Lord's eyes this is something extraordinary and
illogical. Amino is sent on Earth to understand the reason of this anomalous
behavior.
To accomplish his
mission, Amino has the power to assimilate the DNA from human and animal
species he gets in contact with. His DNA evolves and becomes more and more
similar to the one of those creatures. This way Amino should understand them
better. 



Unfortunately, Amino
is not going to be alone on Earth. The Chaos Order will soon reach him. I
won't say what's happening next!!! 




If you stumbled
upon this campaign without knowing about the graphic novel beforehand, you can
look at my blog posts at aminoacidboy.tumblr.com. I've been posting there
my work in progress for more than one year.


The book and other perks
I've already
contacted a quality printer, which is the same chosen by my favorite comic book
editors in Italy. We've already agreed on the budget to get a high quality
product. The book will be a full color, 17x24
cm (6.7x9.5 inches), 156 pages print on Arcoset EW 140 grams paper, sewn
binding. The cover will be printed on Arcoset EW 300 grams paper and will have
inside flaps.



The book will be in
English. Since I'm not proficient in English, a qualified person will revise
the final version of the book. 
Every backer will be very much thanked and named in the acknowledgement page of the book. For contributions equal or greater than 5€, you will receive the digital version of the graphic novel (besides other perks, as you requested). 
You also have a good choise of perks:

After I receive your request and verify your contribution, I'll send you a confirmation email. For any doubt or question fell free to contact me at aminoacidboy@gmail.com.


When will I receive the .pdf of the book?
I will make the .pdf download of the book immediately available, as soon as I receive the funds from Indiegogo. This should be approximately 15 working days after the campaign ends.
Please note that everyone who contribute with an amount equal or greater than 5€ will be able to download the .pdf in italian and/or english.


In what language will Aminoacid Boy and the Chaos Order be printed? 
The printed version of the book is going to be in english. The digital book will be available in italian and/or english. 


Is this book appropriate for children? You seem like a good guy, why the book is so full of violence???
When I started to draw Aminoacid Boy and the Chaos Order, my idea was to create a book for ""adult children"" :-)
I think the whole story has been created as a pretext for drawing a lot of fictional violence. At a certain point in my life I felt the need to reflect on why I have fun in representing scenes of weird violence... even if I truly deprecate violence in real life. Despite this... there are no bad words in the book, I promise! :-)

</h3>
<p>You might know Don Rosa for his Eisner Award winning work on Uncle $crooge and Donald Duck comics, but even before he started working with those world famous characters, he was a well-known cartoonist. For several years, he managed the “Information Center,” a question-and-answer column in different fanzines and did a wide variety of illustrations for those.</p>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><img alt=""Don in his 'Comic Vault.'"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://imageshack.us/a/img18/3633/doncollection.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Don in his 'Comic Vault.'""/></div>
<h2><strong>What Is This (So-Called) Artbook About?<br/></strong></h2>
<p>For the first time EVER, “The Early (So-Called) Art of Don Rosa” will reprint ALL illustrations and mastheads Don did for his “Information Centers.” These great fun illos feature awesome parodies of TV show and movie characters, mashup scenes etc. But this is just the beginning. Be prepared to see school and college newspaper cartoons, private drawings, long comic stories from Don's high school times, advertising illustrations and a whole lot more that you've NEVER seen before (at least if you didn't go to the same schools as Don). For regularly updated samples of the illustrations that will be included, see the “Gallery” tab above. And for those of you who are interested in even more Rosa, we have a package that includes a PDF ebook of the COMPLETE Information Centers, not just the art, with all of Don's answers to readers' questions.</p>
<p>The project is being organized by Jano Rohleder, a longtime friend of Don Rosa's, who is also the German editor/translator of his Duck work. He's also the one who brought you the recent reprint of <em>Captain Kentucky</em> and <em>The Pertwillaby Papers</em> (both books will be in stock in October and are available as perks on this campaign). Jano doesn't do anything unless it's done right and the book will aim at the highest possible quality standard.</p>

<h2><strong>I Ordered the “Don Rosa Classics”... Is It Worth Getting This Book As Well?</strong></h2>
<p>Oh, yes, ABSOLUTELY! The book will have the same oversized format as “The Complete Pertwillaby Papers” and a similar cover design, so it will work perfectly as the final volume of the “Don Rosa Classics.”</p>
<h2>Why Should I Contribute? Where Does My Money Go?</h2>
<p>All funds go directly into the production of the book, so that it can be produced at the most awesome quality! This will be a limited hardback edition of about 350 copies, and only available while stocks last. Contribute at least 99 EUR and lock your copy of the artbook in right now! Free shipping (to everywhere) is included! Or, if you don't want the book itself, you can also get some exclusive Rosa goodies or the previous books (while stocks last) by contributing -- see the list on the right.</p>

<p>All illustrations will appear in the best possible quality. Most were done in black and white, but the ones that Don did in color will be printed in color, of course (as long as Don has a color copy in his archive).</p>
<h3>What Size and Page-Count Can We Expect?</h3>
<p>The artbook will be C4 size (22.9 x 32.4 cm = 9.02 x 12.76 inches). At the moment, the plan is to have about 250 to 300 pages of material, maybe more.</p>
<h3><strong>When Do I Get the Book?</strong></h3>
<p>The first two Don Rosa Classics (PP and CK) are currently in production and will be in stock in October. The artbook will be available in the first half of 2015.</p>
<h3>Is Don Rosa Himself Involved?</h3>
<p>Yes, of course! All material will come from Don's personal archive so that the best possible reproduction quality is given. And as with the two previous “Don Rosa Classics”, he will act as an advisor and oversee every stage of production. There'll also be an introduction written by him.</p>
<h3>Which Fanzine Illustrations Are NOT in the Book?</h3>
<p>The only fanzine illustrations that won't be included are Don's comics “Tagdenah” and “Khulan”. These have already been reprinted in <em>The Complete Pertwillaby Papers</em> and <em>The Complete Captain Kentucky</em>, so we'll use the space for more stuff that hasn't been seen before instead. The same goes for his 12 “Phalanx” strips. If you're interested in these comics, please claim one of those books as your perk (see the table on the right). Oh, and of course we obviously can't include ALL the thousands of comic pages Don did as a kid and in school, but only several examples of his best ones (you wouldn't want to read most of the ones he did until the age of 15 or so anyway, they feature mostly stickman characters). So the focus is on making this a complete collection of his Information Center and other fanzine illos, but there'll be a lot of bonus pages featuring a wide selection of Don's best other pre-Duck work, ranging from some of the aforementioned comics to advertising illos, political cartoons and much more.</p>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><img alt=""One of the many fanzine illustrations."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://imageshack.us/a/img687/7290/kongl.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""One of the many fanzine illustrations.""/></div></div>","Uh... What Do You Want From Me? Who Is This Don Rosa Guy Anyway?

You might know Don Rosa for his Eisner Award winning work on Uncle $crooge and Donald Duck comics, but even before he started working with those world famous characters, he was a well-known cartoonist. For several years, he managed the “Information Center,” a question-and-answer column in different fanzines and did a wide variety of illustrations for those.

What Is This (So-Called) Artbook About?
For the first time EVER, “The Early (So-Called) Art of Don Rosa” will reprint ALL illustrations and mastheads Don did for his “Information Centers.” These great fun illos feature awesome parodies of TV show and movie characters, mashup scenes etc. But this is just the beginning. Be prepared to see school and college newspaper cartoons, private drawings, long comic stories from Don's high school times, advertising illustrations and a whole lot more that you've NEVER seen before (at least if you didn't go to the same schools as Don). For regularly updated samples of the illustrations that will be included, see the “Gallery” tab above. And for those of you who are interested in even more Rosa, we have a package that includes a PDF ebook of the COMPLETE Information Centers, not just the art, with all of Don's answers to readers' questions.
The project is being organized by Jano Rohleder, a longtime friend of Don Rosa's, who is also the German editor/translator of his Duck work. He's also the one who brought you the recent reprint of Captain Kentucky and The Pertwillaby Papers (both books will be in stock in October and are available as perks on this campaign). Jano doesn't do anything unless it's done right and the book will aim at the highest possible quality standard.

I Ordered the “Don Rosa Classics”... Is It Worth Getting This Book As Well?
Oh, yes, ABSOLUTELY! The book will have the same oversized format as “The Complete Pertwillaby Papers” and a similar cover design, so it will work perfectly as the final volume of the “Don Rosa Classics.”
Why Should I Contribute? Where Does My Money Go?
All funds go directly into the production of the book, so that it can be produced at the most awesome quality! This will be a limited hardback edition of about 350 copies, and only available while stocks last. Contribute at least 99 EUR and lock your copy of the artbook in right now! Free shipping (to everywhere) is included! Or, if you don't want the book itself, you can also get some exclusive Rosa goodies or the previous books (while stocks last) by contributing -- see the list on the right.

What Others Say:

“Very funny!” – Scott McCloud (on The Pertwillaby Papers)


“One of my all-time favorite cartoonists.” – Ed Brubaker

Oh, and to clear things up, here are the two color prints available this time (these are NOT the books; for the covers of those, see the Gallery tab above):

“Capt. Kentucky SIGNED Print” (A4 size, limited to 222 copies)


“SIGNED LIMITED CK/PP Print” (A3 size, limited to 150 copies, was already available as the last minute bonus perk in the Classics campaign)

Frequently Asked Questions
I Got All the Stuff in the First Campaign! What's New?
If you ordered the Super Fan Package and the limited PP/CK Print in the Classics campaign, you should get the ""Don Rosa Art Package"" or the ""Information Center Package"".

Any monies raised from the sales of our books (fingers crossed) will then be distributed amongst our collaborators.</p><p>Below is a brief rundown of the costs we expect to incur...</p><p><b>Printing Costs: £1000</b></p><p>We plan on an initial run of 500 copies. Those that aren't sent to our Indiegogo supporters will be distributed both here in the UK and abroad, in conjunction this year's WW1 Centenary celebrations.</p><p><b>Shipping: £500</b></p><p>We want this book to be distributed as widely as possible, which is why we've been careful to factor in enough funds to cover both shipping here in the UK and abroad. So whether you live in Toronto or Timbuktu, we'll get you your copy.</p><p><b>Marketing &amp; Incidentals: £500</b></p><p>As you can see in our Perks section there is a lot of great stuff we want to give you guys for supporting this campaign. This, along with any Indiegogo admin costs we need to pay, will also be covered in our budget.</p><p><b>What happens if we fail to hit our funding goal?</b></p><p>Well first and foremost our number one priority is to get this book published, and get copies to all you nice people who have supported us here on Indiegogo. If we dramatically fall short then we most likely be forced to reduce our initial printing run, but we do have contingencies in place if this is the case. However the more money we raise, the more money we can put into this and future projects.</p><p></p><b>What happens if we exceed our funding goal?</b><p><b><br/></b></p><p>If all you good people dig deep, and help us exceed our fundraising goal, then we intend to take this show on the road. That means promoting the book at small press fairs
and comic expos, which in turn will contribute to the ever burgeoning small press scene both here in the UK and abroad. So any additional funds will go towards covering table costs for these events.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Wherever possible we also want to give back to the creatives involved in this project. They've truly pulled out all the stops to produce truly amazing stories and art for us, without any expectation of financial reward, and we hope to continue to work with as many of them as possible on future projects.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;"">WHAT DO YOU GET...</span><br/></p><p></p><p>Check out below a sneak peek at some of work that will feature in the finished book.<br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/597038/files/20140522071600-Au_Clair_de_La_Lune_crop_for_FB_etc_3_e.jpg?1400768160"" src="""" style=""""/></p><b></b><p style=""text-align: center;""><b>(Artist / Writer: Michael Lightfoot)</b></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b></b></p><p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/597067/files/20140522072847-3.jpg?1400768927"" src="""" style=""""/></b></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><b><b style=""text-align: center;"">(Artist / Writer: Milo Shore)</b></b></p><p></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><b style=""text-align: center;""><br/></b></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/591935/files/20140520074134-P1.jpg?1400596894"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><b>(Artist: Daniel de Sosa / Writer: Karim Iskander Flint)</b></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/597033/files/20140522071248-Screen_Shot_2014-05-22_at_15.07.29.jpg?1400767968"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p style=""font-weight: bold; text-align: center;""><b>(Artist / Writer: Matt Duncan)</b></p><p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b><b><b><br/></b></b></b></p><b></b><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3 style=""font-weight: bold;"">EXCERPT FROM AN INTERVIEW WITH PAT MILLS...</h3><p>A<i>s part of our preparation for this project our man Matt sat down with Pat ""the godfather of British comics"" Mills, writer of the acclaimed WW1 comic book Charley's War. The full and illustrated version of this interview will feature as part of TO ARMS!<br/></i></p><p></p><p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b><i>
</i></b></p><p><b><b>Matt: You’re writing
a new story about the First World War. Can you tell us anything about your new
story?</b></b></p><b>
</b><p>Pat: I’ve only just
started on it and it’s just doing the rounds of publishers. It features a
soldier from  1914 and his
relationship with soldiers from other countries – his “Brothers in Arms”, The
theme is “The World is My Country.</p>
<p><b>Matt: Why revisit
the subject? Is there more you want to say on the subject, or have your views
changed since Charley’s War? </b></p>
<p>Pat: There’s so much
more to say. Firstly, chronologically, CW started in 1916. Brothers starts in
1914 so I get to cover Mons, Loos etc. 
But amongst the many things not covered in detail in Charlie's War featured here:</p>
<p>Drugs.  Burroughs Welcome “Forced March”
tablets of cocaine and caffeine, probably drunk with rum, were given to the
troops. Germans similar.  This has been largely hushed up. Establishment historians didn’t report
it, but it’s a fact. Why not? Because their histories exist to reinforce the
status quo and this raises too many embarrassing questions.</p>
<p><b>Matt: What’s the
difference between doing a WWI story in 2013, and 1979, in terms of the
audience you’re addressing? Is it a more informed or savvy one?</b><br/></p>
<p>Pat: Less savvy today
because the establishment historians have been white washing murderers like
Haig and spreading the lie of the noble sacrifice again. That’s not
co-incidence, that’s a deliberate and disturbing trend. Look at docs like “The Somme – from
defeat to victory”. A doc like that couldn’t have appeared in 1979. No, it was a much sharper time back in
1979. I’m not sure audiences today question as much as people did back then. </p>
<p><b>Matt: Our view of
WWI these days is of a pretty grim experience all round, for very little gain,
if any. Presumably, the anti-propaganda machine has been quite effective in
countering the ‘official’ version of that war, would you agree? </b></p>
<p>Pat: Instinctively, we
all know it was “organised murder” to quote the last Tommy who died
recently. And if that’s true, and
not a meaningless phrase,  then
Haig, Lloyd George and the rest should have faced a war crimes tribunal after the
war. But the establishment
does its best to fight back, and I think they’re winning.</p>
<p>They often quote and trash Black Adder for
criticising Haig. A Sandhurst
historian thought CW was “Vietnam generation” thinking. All of them
loathe Oh, What a Lovely War, which
they wrongly think was some kind of comment on the Vietnam War. That’s how desperate they are to defend
the indefensible.</p>
<p><b>Matt: Charley’s War showed British society during WWI as being riddled
with class prejudice. Has class prejudice disappeared from Britain?</b></p>
<p>Pat: No. It continued in WW2 and I touch upon this in the final volume of CW. And it continues today.  Only now
there is an underclass, the spirit of the working class is broken, much of
their ideology has gone, and they can be legitimately trashed as chavs. So
you have websites like Chavtown, and TV dramas like Shameless, where the middle
classes can go to the zoo and laugh at them.</p>
<p>It’s why in Brothers, I make a point of dramatizing the story of working
class heroine and martyr Alice Wheeldon who fought against the war. We need
working class heroes and heroines.</p>
<p><b>Matt: Did all those men in the First World War die for nothing? Did any good
come out of that war?</b></p>
<p>Pat: That’s an interesting question. In macro political and social terms – no.</p>
<p>If we remember and honor the achievements and courage of  ordinary soldiers  – yes. I say ordinary, because despite
the sacrifices of the officer class, in ultimate terms this was a class war
with the working class sacrificed for the objectives of the upper classes
(colonies, trade, power).</p><p><br/></p><p><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;"">OUR LONG TERM VISION...</span><br/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p>Of course we have great faith in this endeavour, especially as it enables us to introduce so many new readers to the amazing work of the highly talented team of artists and writers we've gathered together. </p><p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p><p>Our long term vision for TO ARMS! is that it will be just the beginning!

Any monies raised from the sales of our books (fingers crossed) will then be distributed amongst our collaborators.Below is a brief rundown of the costs we expect to incur...Printing Costs: £1000We plan on an initial run of 500 copies. Those that aren't sent to our Indiegogo supporters will be distributed both here in the UK and abroad, in conjunction this year's WW1 Centenary celebrations.Shipping: £500We want this book to be distributed as widely as possible, which is why we've been careful to factor in enough funds to cover both shipping here in the UK and abroad. So whether you live in Toronto or Timbuktu, we'll get you your copy.Marketing & Incidentals: £500As you can see in our Perks section there is a lot of great stuff we want to give you guys for supporting this campaign. This, along with any Indiegogo admin costs we need to pay, will also be covered in our budget.What happens if we fail to hit our funding goal?Well first and foremost our number one priority is to get this book published, and get copies to all you nice people who have supported us here on Indiegogo. If we dramatically fall short then we most likely be forced to reduce our initial printing run, but we do have contingencies in place if this is the case. However the more money we raise, the more money we can put into this and future projects.What happens if we exceed our funding goal?If all you good people dig deep, and help us exceed our fundraising goal, then we intend to take this show on the road. That means promoting the book at small press fairs
and comic expos, which in turn will contribute to the ever burgeoning small press scene both here in the UK and abroad. So any additional funds will go towards covering table costs for these events.Wherever possible we also want to give back to the creatives involved in this project. They've truly pulled out all the stops to produce truly amazing stories and art for us, without any expectation of financial reward, and we hope to continue to work with as many of them as possible on future projects.WHAT DO YOU GET...Check out below a sneak peek at some of work that will feature in the finished book.(Artist / Writer: Michael Lightfoot)(Artist / Writer: Milo Shore)(Artist: Daniel de Sosa / Writer: Karim Iskander Flint)(Artist / Writer: Matt Duncan)EXCERPT FROM AN INTERVIEW WITH PAT MILLS...As part of our preparation for this project our man Matt sat down with Pat ""the godfather of British comics"" Mills, writer of the acclaimed WW1 comic book Charley's War. The full and illustrated version of this interview will feature as part of TO ARMS!
Matt: You’re writing
a new story about the First World War. Can you tell us anything about your new
story?
Pat: I’ve only just
started on it and it’s just doing the rounds of publishers. It features a
soldier from  1914 and his
relationship with soldiers from other countries – his “Brothers in Arms”, The
theme is “The World is My Country.
Matt: Why revisit
the subject? Is there more you want to say on the subject, or have your views
changed since Charley’s War? 
Pat: There’s so much
more to say. Firstly, chronologically, CW started in 1916. Brothers starts in
1914 so I get to cover Mons, Loos etc. 
But amongst the many things not covered in detail in Charlie's War featured here:
Drugs.  Burroughs Welcome “Forced March”
tablets of cocaine and caffeine, probably drunk with rum, were given to the
troops. Germans similar.  This has been largely hushed up. Establishment historians didn’t report
it, but it’s a fact. Why not? Because their histories exist to reinforce the
status quo and this raises too many embarrassing questions.
Matt: What’s the
difference between doing a WWI story in 2013, and 1979, in terms of the
audience you’re addressing? Is it a more informed or savvy one?
Pat: Less savvy today
because the establishment historians have been white washing murderers like
Haig and spreading the lie of the noble sacrifice again. That’s not
co-incidence, that’s a deliberate and disturbing trend. Look at docs like “The Somme – from
defeat to victory”. A doc like that couldn’t have appeared in 1979. No, it was a much sharper time back in
1979. I’m not sure audiences today question as much as people did back then. 
Matt: Our view of
WWI these days is of a pretty grim experience all round, for very little gain,
if any. Presumably, the anti-propaganda machine has been quite effective in
countering the ‘official’ version of that war, would you agree? 
Pat: Instinctively, we
all know it was “organised murder” to quote the last Tommy who died
recently. And if that’s true, and
not a meaningless phrase,  then
Haig, Lloyd George and the rest should have faced a war crimes tribunal after the
war. But the establishment
does its best to fight back, and I think they’re winning.
They often quote and trash Black Adder for
criticising Haig. A Sandhurst
historian thought CW was “Vietnam generation” thinking. All of them
loathe Oh, What a Lovely War, which
they wrongly think was some kind of comment on the Vietnam War. That’s how desperate they are to defend
the indefensible.
Matt: Charley’s War showed British society during WWI as being riddled
with class prejudice. Has class prejudice disappeared from Britain?
Pat: No. It continued in WW2 and I touch upon this in the final volume of CW. And it continues today.  Only now
there is an underclass, the spirit of the working class is broken, much of
their ideology has gone, and they can be legitimately trashed as chavs. So
you have websites like Chavtown, and TV dramas like Shameless, where the middle
classes can go to the zoo and laugh at them.
It’s why in Brothers, I make a point of dramatizing the story of working
class heroine and martyr Alice Wheeldon who fought against the war. We need
working class heroes and heroines.
Matt: Did all those men in the First World War die for nothing? Did any good
come out of that war?
Pat: That’s an interesting question. In macro political and social terms – no.
If we remember and honor the achievements and courage of  ordinary soldiers  – yes. I say ordinary, because despite
the sacrifices of the officer class, in ultimate terms this was a class war
with the working class sacrificed for the objectives of the upper classes
(colonies, trade, power).OUR LONG TERM VISION...Of course we have great faith in this endeavour, especially as it enables us to introduce so many new readers to the amazing work of the highly talented team of artists and writers we've gathered together. Our long term vision for TO ARMS! is that it will be just the beginning!

The primary goal is to gradually build the consciousness among the children and youth to stop throwing waste into the rivers and in that way act preventatively against flood damages.

<p><strong>IN THE LAVENDER</strong>, is a story that has something for everyone.  Whether you are into  Steampunk, zombies, pirates, or the post apocalyptic setting, or even if you love action and adventure, this graphic novel has it all.  It is horror, action, comedy and drama all rolled into one!  The story follows a group of heros aboard their flying steamship after they have stumbled across some technology that far surpasses the steampunk world they live in.  The heros believe this new found technology could be a weapon capable of destroying the evil corporation that currently rules the entire planet and its resources. So, they set out to take them down. However, this newly found technology is in the form of a reanimated brain, fitted into a steampunk/cyber mechanical body.  All hell breaks loose once everyone else finds out about this ""discovered technology."" Everyone from pirates to underground machine cultists want it for themselves. Suddenly, the crew finds themselves in a very complicated situation.</p>
<p><strong>   IN THE LAVENDER</strong> is a very well thought out and indepth story.  It has a lot of very intricate plot lines, and story twists and turns that will keep you guessing and wanting more!  The main story though is about the steampunk zombie and how he is a regular guy from the year 2015 ish and his personal struggles in life.  He deals with the same things we all deal with: trying to discover his place in the world, trying to fit in, while facing his own inner demons as well as dealing with misplaced trust and a slew of other problems we all have in life. This isn't a story about the world of tomorrow, or zombies, or robots.  It is a story about you, me, the human condition and how we all are as people.  Just so happens the future is filled with awesome explosions, flying ships, massive mechanical cities, hordes of zombies, and a pile of steam ran everything!!! Welcome to the world of <strong>IN THE LAVENDER!</strong></p>
<p>   The title <strong>In the Lavender</strong> comes from a victorian slang term meaning ""dead."" The  story was written by myself (Eric Xton) and co written by my wife April. Most of the art is done by me, but, there will be many amazing guest artists from around the world helping out, like Josh Falls, Lidia Misfit, Travis Sharpe and colour work by Ryan Mihandoost of Colossal Robot .  All very talented artists!  Also, I will be updating this campaign regularly to keep everyone up to date.  Please bear with me, as I am new at this fund raising for projects thing lol.  Thank you for your interest!</p>

<p>   Your contribution to this campaign will make or break this dream of mine.  I simply cannot do this without you!  To be 100% honest here.  I don't have some cool success story to tell about how my last comic made it world-wide and I'm some super famous special person... I'm not...  I'm just some guy, trying to make something happen that I've always dreamed about doing. </p>
<p>   I know that sites like this one have had some ""shady"" people use the system and get paid then disappear.  I really hope that a couple of bad apples dont ruin it for the ones like me, who really just want a chance to make it happen.  I'm linked with Facebook so I""m easy to track down. I'm not a hard person to find lol.  So, in that I hope that to some level after reading all this and watching the video you get how real I am about what I'm doing here.  I really hope you decide to support this graphic novel of mine , if so fantastic!!!  If not then please check out some of the other pages here you'll probably find a couple of others you might want to get involved in, there are a lot of good ideas here that need help.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i><strong>But what is this web-comic ""Monsieur Charlatan"" I hear you ask?</strong></i></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>Monsieur Charlatan</i> is a historical<i> noir  </i>web-comic, set up in Paris of 1931. It's a project that begun 5 years ago and was only recently completed! This campaign is purposed to fund its printing costs as a full graphic novel! You can read the whole comic online <a href=""http://monsieur-charlatan.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>! (but be informed: the last chapter will only be available in the printed version!) <i><strong>211 pages</strong></i> of drama, suspence, and suicidal tendencies. Lots of them!</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong><i>Who is Isidore Charlatan and what is this comic about?</i></strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Monsieur Charlatan takes place in Paris of the early 1930s; the title character was once a celebrated private detective who solved cases in both Europe and the States. Made penniless by the Wall Street Crash and deserted by his fiancée, Adeline the comic opens with Charlatan contemplating suicide in his family home.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476395974/spm8j1q8sdv3rjhzre6p.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>(It's a close -way too close- shave for Isidore)</i></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The plot soon starts to unfold as Charlatan saves the life of his ex-fiancée who is now the wife of a wheelchair bound Parisian mobster, the Count.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476897653/gg4xckhyetf7psbortmp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>(Khaaaaaaaann!!!)</i></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Things escalate from there and Charlatan is soon forced to solve the mystery behind the attack on his ex-fiancée as the life of his good friend (and secret admirer) Magda is put in danger by an assassin, who sidelines as a University Professor, and  plays a significant part in the whole plot.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>(He really does)</i></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The story may be set in Paris, but there are flashbacks to New Orleans and plenty of action sequences to rival a Hollywood Blockbuster with daring balcony escapes, car chases . . . or rather a bicycle chasing a car; all leading up to the dramatic showdown, which takes place underground in the Parisian catacombs!</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>(Is that a skull in your hands,or are you just glad to see me?)</i></p>
<p>With Absinthe hallucinations, love scenes and wanton brutality all making their mark upon the story, Monsieur Charlatan is a rip-roaring adventure laced with some humor that is sure to leave you breathless and on the edge of your comfy sofa as you read!</p>

But what is this web-comic ""Monsieur Charlatan"" I hear you ask?
Monsieur Charlatan is a historical noir  web-comic, set up in Paris of 1931. It's a project that begun 5 years ago and was only recently completed! This campaign is purposed to fund its printing costs as a full graphic novel! You can read the whole comic online here! (but be informed: the last chapter will only be available in the printed version!) 211 pages of drama, suspence, and suicidal tendencies. Lots of them!
Who is Isidore Charlatan and what is this comic about?
Monsieur Charlatan takes place in Paris of the early 1930s; the title character was once a celebrated private detective who solved cases in both Europe and the States. Made penniless by the Wall Street Crash and deserted by his fiancée, Adeline the comic opens with Charlatan contemplating suicide in his family home.

(It's a close -way too close- shave for Isidore)
The plot soon starts to unfold as Charlatan saves the life of his ex-fiancée who is now the wife of a wheelchair bound Parisian mobster, the Count.
 

(Khaaaaaaaann!!!)
Things escalate from there and Charlatan is soon forced to solve the mystery behind the attack on his ex-fiancée as the life of his good friend (and secret admirer) Magda is put in danger by an assassin, who sidelines as a University Professor, and  plays a significant part in the whole plot.
 

(He really does)
The story may be set in Paris, but there are flashbacks to New Orleans and plenty of action sequences to rival a Hollywood Blockbuster with daring balcony escapes, car chases . . . or rather a bicycle chasing a car; all leading up to the dramatic showdown, which takes place underground in the Parisian catacombs!
 

(Is that a skull in your hands,or are you just glad to see me?)
With Absinthe hallucinations, love scenes and wanton brutality all making their mark upon the story, Monsieur Charlatan is a rip-roaring adventure laced with some humor that is sure to leave you breathless and on the edge of your comfy sofa as you read!

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(Isidore doing his cardio through Paris)

Monsieur Charlatan has gained a considerable audience and has also won two Deviantart awards. You can find articles about it on Freaking Awesome Network, Pretty Cool Wecomics , Grekamag and Comicdom.gr which included it amongst the best web-comics!
 

This project is a web-comic that began in 2011 and finished in 2016. It goes without saying, that throughout these years of actively updating, there has been an improvement of style page after page which will be intentionally left in the final product.
 
About the creator

I have studied computer animation and hold a Masters Degree with Distinction from the Bristol School of Animation in the UK. After finishing my studies I settled down in Athens, Greece, where I have worked in numerous projects storyboarding, animating and in-betweening for films and TV commercials, illustrating children's educational books and last but not least creating comics.

Monsieur Charlatan was a personal project, which started off as a hobby and quickly evolved into some sort of a part time job!  With your help this can go from a web-comic hobby to a physical graphic novel!

For every contribution of 5‎€ and above, a PDF with concept art will be sent, along with a wallpaper of Monsieur Charlatan!!!

<p>Hi there! Thanks for taking an interest in the fundraiser! My name is Derrek Buerger, and today I present to you, a fundraiser to help my next COMIC SERIES, Realms.</p>
<p>Realms is basically about 4 different people having to go out and save the world. They all begin with their own distinctive quests that they have been assigned to, whether it was personal or destined. They all embark on their quests. But later on, they all come to realize that what they want is missing, then the weird stuff happens.</p>
<p>The title Realms is coming from a Minecraft Project I recently had an idea for, but realized it was a bit too small for me to work with minecraft. So, as a way better way to do this project, I wanted it to be a series of Flash Animations with unique music for each part, and create an amazing story with it. That's pretty much everything in a nutshell.</p>
<p>To view what REALMS is like so far, you can go here!: <a href=""http://www.aimlessadventures.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.aimlessadventures.com/</a></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I'm asking $1000 for the series to be made. This is so I can hire others to help out, such as with art, music, and QUITE POSSIBLY, flash games (if we ever decide to try it).</p>
<p>Getting $1000 means a lot to me, as I will have the resources to make Realms amazing as possible. Resources include hiring Musicians, Artists, and quite possibly Flash Programmers. When you contribute to the project, there will be rewards for your donation. For example, you donate $15, and you get the Soundtrack, Stickers, and a Special Thanks in the end of the first Flash Animation for Realms.</p>
<p>NOTE FOR SPECIAL THANKS: When you pledge $1 or more, your name will go on AimlessAdventures.com in the Special Thanks section under the About Tab. We look forward to seeing your name there!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Making Realms is a major goal of mine. I've always had an interest in webcomics, and can remember as far back as 2006 when I discovered VG Cats, and other things about the internet too. Then I discovered other things, such as Eddsworld, Newgrounds, other Media that would scream to me to make Media for the internet as well. I wanna make this to show the world another great webcomic that will have people begging for more. Donating will surely bring my dreams just a bit closer to becoming a reality.</p>
<p>Here's a little track-record of what I've done: I've made 2 Game Grump animations and they have a collaborated view count of over 150,000 views. I'm somewhat known, and I rarely get negative feedback on the things I do now. I also have made No-Brainer, which was a cartoon that had about 4 episodes, with a 5th one mentioned that I WAS working on for quite some time, but never went through with it. That's my only set back.</p>
<p>Pledging to this campaign will help me step foot into professional territory (hopefully) and allow me to do actual business with others, and set up and amazing story for all of you to watch, FOR FREE.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Can't donate? Just share this thing around and hopefully we make it! We'll need as much support for this project than ever imagined. A $1000 Goal isn't asking much. If your already a fan of what I do, go contact others and tell them what's happening here right now!!</p>

<h3>When the zombie apocalypse finally happens..<br/>
</h3>
<p>Hello there!  My name is Jennifer.  I am based out of Sunnyvale CA and I have just recently graduated from the Academy of Art.  Zombie Killers is something I've been working on since January in the hopes of bringing it to a comics convention.  My entire life, I have admired graphic art and comics.  Even through art school as an animator, I kept going back to comics.  Well, after so many attempts at getting a comic going to no avail, I've finally been able to create a full first edition!  I have always been a little bit shy about sharing my art.  Especially when it comes to something like a comic book, they really depend on their readers to become successful. When I got the opportunity to go to the Alternative Press Expo, I was really nervous but also overjoyed.  Now that I have made the commitment I am hoping to raise the money to cover the costs of the table and printing copies of my comic.  If all goes well, I hope that Zombie Killers will bring a little bit of fun and campiness into lots of peoples lives.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>If this campaign succeeds...<br/>
</h3>
<p>The success of my campaign would mean that I would better be able to afford to go to the Alternative Press Expo.  If unable to reach my goal, I will be out a good chunk of money and due to my financial situation, might not be able to print a second book.  Obviously, I will be happy just that I get to go whether anyone is willing to help me or not!  However, the donations would be deeply appreciated.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Yeah, but what do I get??<br/>
</h3>
<p>Well, I have lots of fun and somewhat weird treats for helping me out in my little endeavor!  For each $5 donation you get a sketch of your choice.  $15  A full illustration or techno-art of your choice.  $30 Gets you a full illustration or techno-art of your choice along with the signed comic.  At the $75 mark, you will get the comic, art, and a FABULOUS zombie themed gift basket full of wonderful apocalypse survival prizes! <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't help me out financially, that's ok!  I would really appreciate it though if you could get the word out.  Zombie Killers is a fledgling project and it would mean the world to me if someday it could be enjoyed by people all over!<br/></p>

<h3>We are Hazel and Bell, the duo behind Always Raining Here. We're raising money to publish the first volume of our webcomic in print, which has been a work in progress for the last year and a half! It will be a 96-page long, full colour paperback book.</h3>
<h3>With your donations, we will be able to see our hard work in a physical medium and if you donate enough, you will be able to get a copy for yourself!</h3>
<p>We're going to need $5500 to get ARH in print.  All the money at this point is going towards the printing of the books, which includes taxes, shipping to us, and indiegogo fees. When we're done, it will be in full colour, perfect bound and professionally done.</p>
<p>If you participate in the fundraiser/preorder and donate $25 or more, you automatically receive a copy of Always Raining Here v.1. The book itself is 20 dollars, and the five dollars includes shipping to Canada and the US (we ship elsewhere, but it costs a little more). If you donate more, you can get extra perks that range from author signatures to keychains, tote bags and original work like sketches and hand written fiction.<strong> This fundraiser takes both paypal and credit card, and you don't even need an account to donate to us!</strong></p>
<p>We have set out 35 days for this pre-order - so you basically have until the end of this fundraiser to order this comic. If we don't reach our full goal by the deadline, we'll still use the funds we raise for printing, and everyone will get the perks they donated for, but we will probably end up doing a smaller run.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if we reach our goal before the fundraiser is over, we will post exclusive short stories and other bonus content we wouldn't otherwise post!</p>
<h3><em>***September 8th, 2012: We've reached our funding goal!!***</em></h3>
<p>Thank you so much everyone for helping us get to this point. We have spent the last two weeks compiling the volume for print, so we'll be glad to see all our hard work printed! We will post some bonus stuff for you guys in a few days, but in the meantime Bell and I are just scrambling putting the last peices together for the volume. </p>
<p>Also, if you're still interested in donating now that we've reached our goal, please do! The 5500 we raised merely covers printing costs + shipping to us and taxes. Any money raised beyond this will go directly towards the other prizes we're giving out here and other shipping costs! Every dollar helps.</p>
<h3>***Update September 11th, 2012: Bonus Print if we reach 7,000!***</h3>
<p>As the 5500 dollars we raised will only cover the bare-minimum cost of printing the books, we decided to set another goal to help cover the rest of the costs (fees/prints/keychains/totebags). As a gift to you guys, we will be giving out a free exclusive pre-order only print to everyone who purchases a print version of the book if we reach 7,000 before the end of the fundraiser! Scroll below to the prizes section to check it out. </p>
<p><strong>If you can't contribute anything to our fundraiser but you want to help out anyways, you can spread the word!</strong> We need all the help we can get, and extra coverage would be lovely. Tell your friends, family, or anyone else you think might be interested in our project. Indiegogo also has social media sharing tools that make that sort of thing pretty easy.</p>
<p><br/>Thank you so much for checking this out and spreading the word!</p>

We can discuss what time I'll be doing this, but it'll probably be some time around late October/early November. I will send you the file and and print out a nice copy with your order, or send you the original if it's hand-drawn.</p>
<p>Story Commissions from Bell will be varying from 500-5000 words depending on donation. They are limited to Always Raining Here content (I can't sell fanfiction that would be bad!) and everything will be considered non-canon. You can request any prompt as detailed as you would like. I withold the right to make any sex scene fade out at any point in time. We can discuss the rating and content (I'm fine with writing violence and other intense situations, but generally I won't write porn unless you donate like 500 bucks).</p>
<p><strong>Shipping Details:</strong></p>
<p>Shipping for the comic is included for comics going to the US + Canada. If you're international, please add 10 dollars to help us with shipping fees! We will ship anywhere. Keep in mind that books will be sent via regular post. </p>
<p>NOTE: If you've already contributed, but forgot to add shipping, you can add it by clicking ""Contribute now"" and scrolling to the bottom of the list and selecting ""No perk, just a contribution"" and put 10 dollars for international orders. Thanks you!</p>

As the 5500 dollars we raised will only cover the bare-minimum cost of printing the books, we decided to set another goal to help cover the rest of the costs (fees/prints/keychains/totebags). As a gift to you guys, we will be giving out a free exclusive pre-order only print to everyone who purchases a print version of the book if we reach 7,000 before the end of the fundraiser! Scroll below to the prizes section to check it out. 
If you can't contribute anything to our fundraiser but you want to help out anyways, you can spread the word! We need all the help we can get, and extra coverage would be lovely. Tell your friends, family, or anyone else you think might be interested in our project. Indiegogo also has social media sharing tools that make that sort of thing pretty easy.
Thank you so much for checking this out and spreading the word!
Bell and Hazel

We can discuss what time I'll be doing this, but it'll probably be some time around late October/early November. I will send you the file and and print out a nice copy with your order, or send you the original if it's hand-drawn.
Story Commissions from Bell will be varying from 500-5000 words depending on donation. They are limited to Always Raining Here content (I can't sell fanfiction that would be bad!) and everything will be considered non-canon. You can request any prompt as detailed as you would like. I withold the right to make any sex scene fade out at any point in time. We can discuss the rating and content (I'm fine with writing violence and other intense situations, but generally I won't write porn unless you donate like 500 bucks).

The story begins to take on more of a life of its own as details from the first volume are fleshed out nicely. There's plenty of action and gore, but none of it is either gratuitous or out of place or character. There are also some great nods to science fiction of old and I simply can't wait for Volume 3.""My campaign is to fund the marketing and creation of a single massive graphic novel. I will combine the first two Fed books with the yet to be created third book into a huge hardcover complete graphic novel. The funding will allow me to print and market the novel outside the traditional distribution channels. To be a complete creator owned entity.Your generous contributions to this campaign will help raise funds for the publication and distribution of the super graphic novel, The Fed: Accelerator. I have anticipated the need for approximately $20,000 to help support pre-publication, publication, and post publication costs. These costs include, but are not limited to editorial services ($500); Website creation,hosting and domain services ($500) online distribution and shipping ($2,000); initial print run of 1000 copies ($4500); and marketing and promotional services ($10,000).

<p>Hello, my name is Sean, and i’ve been working on putting together this mammoth project over the last 4 years, (i am not paying myself anything as it's a non-profit) and you can now help to raise the last bit of cash to get it out for the world to see.</p>
<p>My motivation behind creating this project, was to put together a work which would help raise money for worthy causes, but also to provide the reader with an educational and engaging collection of comics, art and illustrated factual and pieces surrounding themes of war, but from an emotional &amp; humanitarian angle. Think of it like a <span class=""caps"">WIKILEAKS</span>; getting the real stories out there, but with mostly personal accounts and emotive art.</p>
<p><strong>“War: The Human Cost” will consist of a 260 page perfect bound book, and a 21 track music CD compilation on themes of war and peace.

<p>With so much conflict in the world, the book and CD addresses &amp; exposes all the surrounding complex issues on why humans go to war, and the very real universal cost that it entails. It also looks at the more positive stories to come out of war and suffering and those creating practical alternatives to the destruction it causes.</p>
<p>I contacted many people, commissioned work and also allowed for open submissions from comic artists, writers, illustrators and musicians. <br/>I was astounded by the response. I received over 800 pages of work from artists from 24 countries, with some amazing, heartfelt and well-researched work. I’ve now edited that down to a much smaller and better book, &amp; am just working on my own last 3 contributions to this work.</p>
<p><strong>The book &amp; CD is a not-for-profit project run by Community Art Projects/ Paper Tiger Comix (a small, one-man independent publisher ie: me), which is helping to raise money and awareness for Campaign Against the Arms trade (<a href=""http://www.caat.org.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.caat.org.uk/</a>), aswell as raising awareness of campaign groups such as War On Want, Amnesty International, CND, Unicef &amp; Hero Rats (training african rats to safely sniff out landmines!).</strong></p>

<p>The aim is to bring people together, and look at the causes and effects of war. I believe, that it is through understanding, real-life stories, solid journalism, expressive art &amp; allowing different voices to be represented, that we can work against fear, propaganda and warmongering, &amp; lessen the dehumanisation and ‘us &amp; them’ mentality that is whipped up around the world by various leaders/ groups to create conflict, exploitation &amp; hate.</p>
<p><strong>The comic strips include well researched stories from around the world (Tibet, Afghanistan, Israel &amp; Palestine, Africa, Iraq, etc) which cover everything from human rights struggles, war veterans &amp; <span class=""caps"">PTSD</span>, political imprisonment &amp; torture, child soldiers, refugees /asylum seekers, peace campaigns, the arms trade, corruption/ conflicts of interest, military spending, propaganda to humour &amp; satire.</strong></p>
<p>Some of the stories are more historical, going back to previous generations (Vietnam, World War 2, Spanish Civil War etc) &amp; the very personal/ moving stories of those involved.</p>
<p><strong>Paul Gravett, leading author on comics, journalist, and curator of the <span class=""caps"">COMICA</span> events (plus one of the supporters of the project), has read the collated work and said “this will be a landmark project”.</strong></p>

<p>So far the project has raised £3450 externally (it's in the CAP community bank account waiting for the target to be reached), I have put in £1500 myself into this project, and have raised another £1750 via some wonderful sponsors, contributers, and by putting on two benefit gigs.

<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Our origins</b></p>
<p>The Hidden City (“La Città Nascosta”) is a comic book. It was born in 2012 in Turin, Italy, at the Cottolengo School (<a href=""http://www.scuolacottolengo.org)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.scuolacottolengo.org)</a>, in collaboration with The Italian Comic Book Illustrators Association and talented students from Italy’s most
prestigious Academy of Fine Arts.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Since then it was published online and available for free, in Italian, English and Arabic:</span><br/></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Our inspiration</b></p>
<p>Our goal is to
convey , through our comics,  a gospel of hopes towards <i>the last of the earth</i> , origin and inspiration of St. Joseph Cottolengo's example and message. </p>
<p>The Hidden City illustrates true
stories of young girls and boys who discovered the beauty
of giving love and compassion to someone else. It is inspired by real life episodes of people attending the Cottolengo School, facing severe disabilities or critical poorness.<br/></p>

</div></div>","Our origins
The Hidden City (“La Città Nascosta”) is a comic book. It was born in 2012 in Turin, Italy, at the Cottolengo School (www.scuolacottolengo.org), in collaboration with The Italian Comic Book Illustrators Association and talented students from Italy’s most
prestigious Academy of Fine Arts.
Since then it was published online and available for free, in Italian, English and Arabic:
http://issuu.com/afnews.info/stacks/d1d8613ab7ab479abf3f5b7ba4d07cf2 
Our inspiration
Our goal is to
convey , through our comics,  a gospel of hopes towards the last of the earth , origin and inspiration of St. Joseph Cottolengo's example and message. 
The Hidden City illustrates true
stories of young girls and boys who discovered the beauty
of giving love and compassion to someone else. It is inspired by real life episodes of people attending the Cottolengo School, facing severe disabilities or critical poorness.













Our message
Our stories mean to prove that, by helping someone in difficulty, you and the entire community receive back much more that what has been given for help, often in unexpected ways.  
Unexpected was also the success obtained by the Hidden City amongst visitors. The number exceeded our expectations (over 1,600.00 IP
addresses). 


Our “poor” art and our passion for sports and loyalty (a “series” dedicated to the high values of rugby) proved to be a great vehicle for our message and people around the world showed unexpected interest and passion for our releases.
Our goal
We want to continue illustrating new stories and we want to give more and more people the chance to read the Hidden City and to appreciate its message and ""hidden"" hopes. 
We want to increase the number of languages available and we want to continue giving this chance to our public for free!


Your help
So far we could survive thanks to donations and charity, but after December '14 release, funds are over.
By helping and donating something to the Hidden City you will help us paying the basic costs for another two years (8 releases) of colorful and meaningful releases.
Costs include:
- Professional Illustrators fees;
- Students reimbursements;
- Tools and production costs;
- Graphics and layout;
- Online distribution and website costs;
Without your help the Hidden City will have to shut down its doors and with its closure also the inspiring reality of the Cottolengo School and the special stories o its inspiring guests will have less chances to be shared, appreciated and supported by the rest of the world.

This show provides a huge platform for artists, writers, and publishers to present their independent work in front of a public who may not get to see it otherwise. Even if we do not reach our goal of $1,000, funds will still sustain printing costs and be used to bring Rookery to you!

<p>*Also some of these items are in limited quantities so get them while you can!</p>
<p>* The physical book is only in the higher tiers because those are exclusive copies we are shipping earliest before SPX, and before they will be up in an online shop. This is why it's an early bird special and comes with a high-tier commission. They will be made available for all once we raise enough money to get them printed, so please help make the physical copy a reality by donating! </p>

</div></div>","On the date of December 21, 2012 everyone thought the world was coming to an end. As usual, the scientific community was wrong, however something monumental did occur that would alter the destiny of a planet and it's people. A woman child was born with many powers that was formed in her DNA thousands of years before her arrival on planet Earth.       I 'm going to tell the story of a futuristic epic combination of an esoteric tale of Star Wars meets the Matrix, meets Avatar and throw in the X Men.      Have you ever wanted to see a kick-ass female pull off the most daring and the heroic epic of all time? A female hero who is more powerful than Superman, all of the X men combined and any other super hero you've ever known? Well she's here and her name is Femi Ayira Knight. Femi (meaning I'm loved) Ayira (meaning the chosen one) Knight. She comes to you by way of the Creators of the Universe. The world didn't end like everyone thought it would. There is no man or womb man on planet Terra who can defeat her and her king, Zuri (meaning beautiful) Oluchi (meaning beautiful work) Noble. He has an incredible tale to be told himself. By now, we are in the energies of the Femi9 principle that has drenched the Solar System we dwell in. She was created to grace the planet Earth with her knowledge and her caring for all people to receive the justice they deserve from the hurt and the pain each one is encountering from the injustices that has been thrust upon them. 
FEMI, THE WAR QUEEN SITTING ON HER THRONETHE POWER WITHIN                                             An excerpt of War:     “Queen, we've been under attack for weeks now. There’s no stopping these
‘things’. For each one we kill, three will take its place! When I left Mexico,
all was quiet. I don’t know what it’s like now. I have not been able to
communicate with our people there. This country is overwhelmed with these
creatures!”
    “Help is here now, bro. Miso! Continue on fighting. Show no mercy as
they show no mercy to the people!  Drop
them where they stand, leave them in the mire of their own villainous crude!”  
    She reassured Miso that fighting would be the only thing that would stop
the Crowne Cross in their tracks. Zuri, meanwhile sent a maelstrom of laser
blasts to a gang of the beasts, sizzling them down to ashes. As they fought
through the long, hot days and days, none of them gave up as the evil armies
continued on the merciless orders of the Draeconian fighting machine.
    
It was determined by Femi that Brazil could be controlled by the
Iwatchers who fought with Miso. Aradlugal gave the order for more than 100
Sumerian ships to stay behind and clean up the gruesome aftermath. Once they
were able to bring Brazil under control slaying at least 35,000 enemy troopers,
the fight moved on to Paraguay.

     The evil Draechons, the upright walking Reptiles, the mindless drones of the Crown Crest and the Android soldiers of the Talisman will be a challenge to Femi, Zuri and the Iwatchers. I want to bring this never before told tale to life, 
        At this moment, I am in negotiations with the chief animator Tony Qwade, to make these stories a reality beyond animation and eventually adapt it on the silver INDEPENDENT screen. I am also needing better sound equipment to make the necessary realistic sounds come to life.

<h3>The Pride</h3>
<p>Have you ever been sick of being misrepresented? Of having no one like you to look up to? Have you ever wanted to change everything?<br/><br/>Well, FabMan has. In a world populated by superpowers, the superhero is common. Sadly for FabMan (Tomorrow’s Fabulous Man, Today), he feels a deep schism in the representation of his community, his own heroic exploits being presented as just big jokes in the news. Wan<span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span><span class=""text_exposed_show"">ting to fight for change, he forms PRIDE, the world’s premier LGBT supergroup. Not a gay superteam, just a team where most members are LGBT. Not exactly receiving the desired response, the group faces opposition from the confrontational Justice Division, more aggressive misrepresentation by the media and are then taken advantage of in the plans of the nefarious Reverend. After a serious trial by fire, the team find themselves the only super team in the world capable of stopping The Reverend’s diabolical plot for world domination.<br/><br/>Join FabMan, Wolf, Sapphire, Frost, Twink, Bear, Angel and White Trash on their mission to help people and improve LGBT representation in the process.</span></p>
<span class=""text_exposed_show""></span>
</div>
<div><span class=""text_exposed_show"">
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is 'The Pride'?</strong></p>
<strong></strong></span></div>
<p><span class=""text_exposed_show""><strong></strong></span> </p>
<p><span class=""text_exposed_show""><em>The Pride</em> is a six-issue mini-series written by Joe Glass, and with art by rising star Gavin MItchell, and Kris Carter. The series will be published by Deadstar Publishing, and is seeking further distribution.</span></p>
<p><strong>Our Story</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I'm Joe Glass, and I'm a gay man who loves comics. Luckily, I also happen to be a writer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When I was growing up, and coming to terms with my sexuality, one of the things I always felt sad about was the fact there were no visible, openly gay superheroes I could relate to. Sure, there were one or two, but they lived in the background or were poorly reresented. Ever since then, I wanted to change that. And that's what <em>The Pride</em> is all about.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Taking me many years to work out the story, let the characters grow an evolve in my head, and the most important part of finding a great artist; we are finally ready to bring this project out into the world.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Helping me I have the fantastic new artist Gavin Mitchell, who provides the excellent artwork on the series. Kris Carter brings that art to life with his glorious colours. A host of other artists are providing one page stories nd covers for the series too. And Deadstar Publishing are helping me to brin it to a wider audience than I could by myself. But as new creators, we could always use more help to get this comic out even further.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong> </p>
<div>
<p>The whole point of doing this project is to provide young LGBT comics readers with heroes they can look up to, and older ones with heroes they can relate to; it's to cover issues that straight readers may not be aware of, or may have disregarded as something which 'doesn't affect them' when they affect all of us; it can hopefully change some opinions and help push for an improvement in representation; and most of all, it will be fun!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If we are unsuccessful here, the comic will still come out. But we won't be able to spread it as far as we would like, and there is little point to a message if no one can actually hear it.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The money raised by this project will be used to pay for printing larger print runs of this comic that I can distribute personally, or through stores who order the book too. Furthermore, each donation can be used as a kind of 'pre-order' that we can show larger distributors like Diamond the kind of numbers we can achieve, so hopefully they will work with us to help distribute the comic as far and wide as possible. The other benefit of the poject being on this site is that it's the best way to get your copy if you live in the United States or outside of the UK. As yet, we are working on distribution deals in those territories, but we're not there yet. So your help will let us spread this message globally. Higher print runs and perorder numbers are of course also possible even if we don't hit the ultimate target, but the more we raise the better.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In fact, if we beat the target, then it just means we can print more, market more, and maybe even commission more artists to provide their help in the series. Anything to make this project as big and great as it can be! </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you can't help fund the series, you can help spread the word! There are links to the comics Facebook and twitter pages, and I'll keep this project updated on any and all news on the comic, so you can keep helping by passing that info on to anyone you know and encouraging them to help us. Thank You!</p>

Sadly for FabMan (Tomorrow’s Fabulous Man, Today), he feels a deep schism in the representation of his community, his own heroic exploits being presented as just big jokes in the news. Wan...ting to fight for change, he forms PRIDE, the world’s premier LGBT supergroup. Not a gay superteam, just a team where most members are LGBT. Not exactly receiving the desired response, the group faces opposition from the confrontational Justice Division, more aggressive misrepresentation by the media and are then taken advantage of in the plans of the nefarious Reverend. After a serious trial by fire, the team find themselves the only super team in the world capable of stopping The Reverend’s diabolical plot for world domination.Join FabMan, Wolf, Sapphire, Frost, Twink, Bear, Angel and White Trash on their mission to help people and improve LGBT representation in the process.



 
What is 'The Pride'?

 
The Pride is a six-issue mini-series written by Joe Glass, and with art by rising star Gavin MItchell, and Kris Carter. The series will be published by Deadstar Publishing, and is seeking further distribution.
Our Story
 
I'm Joe Glass, and I'm a gay man who loves comics. Luckily, I also happen to be a writer.
 
When I was growing up, and coming to terms with my sexuality, one of the things I always felt sad about was the fact there were no visible, openly gay superheroes I could relate to. Sure, there were one or two, but they lived in the background or were poorly reresented. Ever since then, I wanted to change that. And that's what The Pride is all about.
 
Taking me many years to work out the story, let the characters grow an evolve in my head, and the most important part of finding a great artist; we are finally ready to bring this project out into the world.
 
Helping me I have the fantastic new artist Gavin Mitchell, who provides the excellent artwork on the series. Kris Carter brings that art to life with his glorious colours. A host of other artists are providing one page stories nd covers for the series too. And Deadstar Publishing are helping me to brin it to a wider audience than I could by myself. But as new creators, we could always use more help to get this comic out even further.
 
The Impact
 

The whole point of doing this project is to provide young LGBT comics readers with heroes they can look up to, and older ones with heroes they can relate to; it's to cover issues that straight readers may not be aware of, or may have disregarded as something which 'doesn't affect them' when they affect all of us; it can hopefully change some opinions and help push for an improvement in representation; and most of all, it will be fun!
 
If we are unsuccessful here, the comic will still come out. But we won't be able to spread it as far as we would like, and there is little point to a message if no one can actually hear it.


What We Need & What You Get
The money raised by this project will be used to pay for printing larger print runs of this comic that I can distribute personally, or through stores who order the book too. Furthermore, each donation can be used as a kind of 'pre-order' that we can show larger distributors like Diamond the kind of numbers we can achieve, so hopefully they will work with us to help distribute the comic as far and wide as possible. The other benefit of the poject being on this site is that it's the best way to get your copy if you live in the United States or outside of the UK. As yet, we are working on distribution deals in those territories, but we're not there yet. So your help will let us spread this message globally. Higher print runs and perorder numbers are of course also possible even if we don't hit the ultimate target, but the more we raise the better.
 
In fact, if we beat the target, then it just means we can print more, market more, and maybe even commission more artists to provide their help in the series. Anything to make this project as big and great as it can be! 



Other Ways You Can Help
Even if you can't help fund the series, you can help spread the word! There are links to the comics Facebook and twitter pages, and I'll keep this project updated on any and all news on the comic, so you can keep helping by passing that info on to anyone you know and encouraging them to help us.

We’re a diverse group of people from all over the country who create comics, make books, write articles, do performance art, and fill out giant spreadsheets full of data based on original research we conduct on labor, economics, gender, sexuality, and race in the comics industry. Women make up 51% of the world’s population yet hold only 25% of the paid gigs in cultural production. In comics, it’s worse: Male creators make up only 54% of the industry but get 90% of the freelance contracts, which translates into some very real pay inequities. On average, male creators make <em>3.5 times more than</em> female ones from comics—and <em>19.5 times as much</em> as trans, genderqueer, or non-binary gender creators.</p>

<p>Sancta Sanctorum is a new urban fantasy comic set in an alternate/dystopic present Earth where the <strong>Saints</strong> themselves (the ""original"" Saint Nicholas, Saint Augustine himself etc.) awoke from the Holy Relics to fight against the swarming Demons from hell.</p>
<p>Inspired by “The Preacher”, “American Gods”, “Hellblazer”, the ""Da Vinci Code"", the “Dogma” movie and the ""Saint Seiya"" manga, this graphic novel faces strong themes like faith, religion and gives a new, modern, fast and furious view of some of the most important heroes in human history: the Saints.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Peter II Roman, Patriarch of the new church</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our main characters are not ""perfect"" Saints, but ""imperfect"" human sinners instead, who can wield the miracles hidden in the Holy Relics. They are called the <strong>Martyrs</strong>. The Saints of the new Church persecute the Martyrs as dangerous heretics and claim one of them is the Antichrist in disguise. The Martyrs on the other hand wish to stop the Patriarch from erasing all human sinners from the Earth along with Demons. Who's right? Who's wrong? Follow us and discover the truth behind many of Christianity myth mysteries...</p>
<p>The setting is inspired by a novel written by Gilbert Gallo (that would be me, guys!), artwork is provided by Michele d’Aloisio and script by Daniele Solfrini. If this all sounds like your cup of tea, read on and support our crusade!</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>The Dark Ones swarming on Earth</i></p>
<p>A few years ago on Earth suddenly appeared the <strong>Dark Ones</strong>: demonic creatures who craved human souls and flesh. In no time, they decimated the world’s population but, when all seemed lost, a young boy acquired directly from Heaven incredible powers. He appointed himself the <strong>Patriarch</strong> of the one faith, thus founding the <strong>New Church “Dei Invicti Operae”</strong>.</p>
<p>Guided by the word of God, the Patriarch awakened the spirits of the <strong>Saints </strong>from their <strong>Relics</strong>. The Holy Father guided his legions of Saints against the Dark Ones and, after years of relentless war, the forces of the Lord eventually triumphed. Today, life goes on under the guidance and control of the New Church, who wishes to exterminate all Demons and establish the ""Kingdom of God"" on Earth.</p>

<p><i>St. Augustine - Scourge of Heretics and slayer of Dark Ones</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Alas, internal strife, <i>heretical divisions</i> and rebellion against the strict divine laws are on the agenda. To make matters worse, the Dark Ones, even if defeated, are still a concrete threat that the New Church wishes to eradicate once and for all. The Patriarch instituted an authoritarian theocracy where the Saints, supported by flocks of winged Chrismatics, maintain order and protect people from all enemies, whether external or internal to the Pontificate. The vast majority of the population is happy to live as the “Lord’s flock” and sees in the New Church the only hope against the Dark Ones.</p>
<p>There is also a different type of divine beings: the <strong>Martyrs</strong>. These powerful hybrids between a man and a Saint are human sinners (with all kind of human vices and flaws) who can wield the incredible powers of the Holy Relics.</p>

<p>The Martyrs are the main characters of Sancta Sanctorum graphic novel. In this #1 issue called ""The Rebel Saints"", the story follows the young <strong>Taro</strong>, a reckless, naive but good-hearted boy, who unintentionally becomes a victim of the power games and the struggles between the New Church and the secret society called the “<strong>God’s Hand</strong>” who employs Martyrs to accomplish its own goals.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Taro - keeper of the Holy Shroud</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Taro’s uncle, the bishop of Turin, who is a powerful member of the God’s Hand, replaces the <strong>Holy Shroud</strong> with a fake, wishing to hinder the Patriarch’s secret plan of destroying the human race and building a sinless world inhabited only by Saints. Alas, the patron saint of the city, <strong>St. John the Baptist, </strong>discovers the theft and sentences the bishop and his nephew Taro to be burned at the stakes. The Martyrs arrive just in time to save the day and witness the incredible miracle of Taro merging with the Holy Shroud, acquiring its great powers. This way, Taro will become a Martyr too, and his life will be forever changed.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Leo - keeper of St. Francis's relic.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>In this troubled scenario will take place the epic deeds of <i>the Martyrs: too divine to be mere humans, but too imperfect to be Saints.</i> Persecuted by the New Church and tempted by the Dark Ones, Taro and his incredible friends will face difficult choices on the narrow line between good and evil, constantly testing their faith. Who among them is the <strong>Antichrist</strong>? Which side will they join? They have to decide quickly, the Armageddon is coming ...</p>

<p>To keep backers’ costs as low as possible and to be sure we can deliver everything on time, <strong>MOST of the rewards provided in a DIGITAL (HI-RES PDF) format</strong>. This means that the additional comics (Xaulos, the Game Rules and Ash Airways), the diplomas, the certificates, the indulgences and the concept book will be delivered to you via e-mail in pdf format after the campaign ends.</p>
<p>On the other hand, <strong>on-demand commissions and original, signed pages will be PHYSICAL rewards, shipped internationally and free of charge for backers</strong>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Important Print-on-Demand and shipping info</strong></h3>
<p>Ok, your pledge granted you a digital (PDF) copy. What if you wanted a printed version too?</p>
<p>Look for this symbol:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1475877661/xknbgwg1pavukgspkj60.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>If the reward you selected with your pledge has the above symbol</strong>, it will be later available for a Print-on-Demand option via DriveThruComics. When our books are proofed and ready, <strong>we will send you</strong> (and to every other single backer) <strong>a special discount that allows you to purchase the print format of our titles at the mere cost of printing and shipping</strong> (ONLY IF you actually want a printed copy, of course!). This way, our supporters will benefit of two important advantages:</p>
<p>1. Our backers will pay the absolute base print cost plus DriveThru shipping charges (which are actual charges, not inflated in any way). This means that <strong>backers SAVE MONEY this way</strong> instead of paying additional fees due to the crowdfunding campaign.</p>
<p>2. You can this way <strong>buy as many printed copies as you want</strong>, deciding the exact amount on the actual purchase day, and not beforehand.</p>
<p>Physical copies of the <strong>Rebel Saints comic book</strong>, the <strong>Sketchbook</strong> and the <strong>Artbook </strong>will be available for the PoD option this way.</p>
<p>This way we allow you to pay the less possible amount for printing and shipping costs, which would inevitably increase if we had to include them beforehand in our campaign. Thank you for your understanding, we are sure you'll appreciate this ""discount"" on your exclusive books's printing and shipping fares.</p>
<p><strong>We will NOT offer print-on-demand Diplomas, Holy Certificates or Indulgences</strong>. They are ""one-of-a-kind"" pieces and we’re sure you’ll find a lot of less expensive ways to print those for yourselves from the HI-RES pdf we’ll send you and hang them on the wall in a nice frame if you wish!</p>
<p>Of course, if your pledge involves more than one printed item, you will pay shipping costs only once. For further info and details,  please check these links:</p>

<p>For an <strong>accurate price quotation</strong> note that the comic book is a ""Softbound book"" up to 64 pages while the artbook and the sketchbook are ""hardbound books"" up to 64 pages.</p>
<p>For your convenience, we already provided you an approximate printing cost for every single reward available on PoD. We recommend to follow the aforementioned links for a more accurate price quotation.</p>

Sancta Sanctorum is a new urban fantasy comic set in an alternate/dystopic present Earth where the Saints themselves (the ""original"" Saint Nicholas, Saint Augustine himself etc.) awoke from the Holy Relics to fight against the swarming Demons from hell.
Inspired by “The Preacher”, “American Gods”, “Hellblazer”, the ""Da Vinci Code"", the “Dogma” movie and the ""Saint Seiya"" manga, this graphic novel faces strong themes like faith, religion and gives a new, modern, fast and furious view of some of the most important heroes in human history: the Saints.

Peter II Roman, Patriarch of the new church
 
Our main characters are not ""perfect"" Saints, but ""imperfect"" human sinners instead, who can wield the miracles hidden in the Holy Relics. They are called the Martyrs. The Saints of the new Church persecute the Martyrs as dangerous heretics and claim one of them is the Antichrist in disguise. The Martyrs on the other hand wish to stop the Patriarch from erasing all human sinners from the Earth along with Demons. Who's right? Who's wrong? Follow us and discover the truth behind many of Christianity myth mysteries...
The setting is inspired by a novel written by Gilbert Gallo (that would be me, guys!), artwork is provided by Michele d’Aloisio and script by Daniele Solfrini. If this all sounds like your cup of tea, read on and support our crusade!
 


The Dark Ones swarming on Earth
A few years ago on Earth suddenly appeared the Dark Ones: demonic creatures who craved human souls and flesh. In no time, they decimated the world’s population but, when all seemed lost, a young boy acquired directly from Heaven incredible powers. He appointed himself the Patriarch of the one faith, thus founding the New Church “Dei Invicti Operae”.
Guided by the word of God, the Patriarch awakened the spirits of the Saints from their Relics. The Holy Father guided his legions of Saints against the Dark Ones and, after years of relentless war, the forces of the Lord eventually triumphed. Today, life goes on under the guidance and control of the New Church, who wishes to exterminate all Demons and establish the ""Kingdom of God"" on Earth.

St. Augustine - Scourge of Heretics and slayer of Dark Ones
 
Alas, internal strife, heretical divisions and rebellion against the strict divine laws are on the agenda. To make matters worse, the Dark Ones, even if defeated, are still a concrete threat that the New Church wishes to eradicate once and for all. The Patriarch instituted an authoritarian theocracy where the Saints, supported by flocks of winged Chrismatics, maintain order and protect people from all enemies, whether external or internal to the Pontificate. The vast majority of the population is happy to live as the “Lord’s flock” and sees in the New Church the only hope against the Dark Ones.
There is also a different type of divine beings: the Martyrs. These powerful hybrids between a man and a Saint are human sinners (with all kind of human vices and flaws) who can wield the incredible powers of the Holy Relics.

Egil - keeper of St. George's relic
 
Forced to live as fugitives, they are hunted by the most branched and organized New Church  who has branded them as heretics.
 

Arian - keeper of St. Lucy's relic.
 
The Martyrs are the main characters of Sancta Sanctorum graphic novel. In this #1 issue called ""The Rebel Saints"", the story follows the young Taro, a reckless, naive but good-hearted boy, who unintentionally becomes a victim of the power games and the struggles between the New Church and the secret society called the “God’s Hand” who employs Martyrs to accomplish its own goals.

Taro - keeper of the Holy Shroud
 
Taro’s uncle, the bishop of Turin, who is a powerful member of the God’s Hand, replaces the Holy Shroud with a fake, wishing to hinder the Patriarch’s secret plan of destroying the human race and building a sinless world inhabited only by Saints. Alas, the patron saint of the city, St. John the Baptist, discovers the theft and sentences the bishop and his nephew Taro to be burned at the stakes. The Martyrs arrive just in time to save the day and witness the incredible miracle of Taro merging with the Holy Shroud, acquiring its great powers. This way, Taro will become a Martyr too, and his life will be forever changed.
 

Leo - keeper of St. Francis's relic.
 
In this troubled scenario will take place the epic deeds of the Martyrs: too divine to be mere humans, but too imperfect to be Saints. Persecuted by the New Church and tempted by the Dark Ones, Taro and his incredible friends will face difficult choices on the narrow line between good and evil, constantly testing their faith. Who among them is the Antichrist? Which side will they join? They have to decide quickly, the Armageddon is coming ...

On the other hand, on-demand commissions and original, signed pages will be PHYSICAL rewards, shipped internationally and free of charge for backers.
 
Important Print-on-Demand and shipping info
Ok, your pledge granted you a digital (PDF) copy. What if you wanted a printed version too?
Look for this symbol:

 
If the reward you selected with your pledge has the above symbol, it will be later available for a Print-on-Demand option via DriveThruComics. When our books are proofed and ready, we will send you (and to every other single backer) a special discount that allows you to purchase the print format of our titles at the mere cost of printing and shipping (ONLY IF you actually want a printed copy, of course!). This way, our supporters will benefit of two important advantages:
1. Our backers will pay the absolute base print cost plus DriveThru shipping charges (which are actual charges, not inflated in any way). This means that backers SAVE MONEY this way instead of paying additional fees due to the crowdfunding campaign.
2. You can this way buy as many printed copies as you want, deciding the exact amount on the actual purchase day, and not beforehand.
Physical copies of the Rebel Saints comic book, the Sketchbook and the Artbook will be available for the PoD option this way.
This way we allow you to pay the less possible amount for printing and shipping costs, which would inevitably increase if we had to include them beforehand in our campaign. Thank you for your understanding, we are sure you'll appreciate this ""discount"" on your exclusive books's printing and shipping fares.
We will NOT offer print-on-demand Diplomas, Holy Certificates or Indulgences. They are ""one-of-a-kind"" pieces and we’re sure you’ll find a lot of less expensive ways to print those for yourselves from the HI-RES pdf we’ll send you and hang them on the wall in a nice frame if you wish!
Of course, if your pledge involves more than one printed item, you will pay shipping costs only once. For further info and details,  please check these links:
official DriveThruComics page on printing costs
official DriveThruComics page on shipping costs.
For an accurate price quotation note that the comic book is a ""Softbound book"" up to 64 pages while the artbook and the sketchbook are ""hardbound books"" up to 64 pages.
For your convenience, we already provided you an approximate printing cost for every single reward available on PoD. We recommend to follow the aforementioned links for a more accurate price quotation.

Quel ponte sul mare è il luogo preferito di Paul, solitario e introverso adolescente, con un talento che lo eleva ma che lo rende solo, il disegno.</i></p><p style=""color: #337d7c;""><i>In quel luogo sospeso, Paul fa un incontro che cambierà per sempre la sua vita. Proprio dal mare emerge una creatura bella e inquietante, dal corpo fragile e longilineo con un diastema tra le labbra rosse. La ragazza compare senza preavviso, senza abiti e senza voce. Paul la crede muta ma la notte gli parla in sogno. </i></p><p style=""color: #337d7c;""><i>Va e viene attraverso l’acqua e i sogni, consolidando ogni volta un sentimento speciale nel cuore del giovane. Lei sola capisce le sue tristezze, lei sola apprezza il suo animo creativo, lei sola sa chi è davvero Paul. </i></p><p style=""color: #337d7c;""><i>Ben presto, i compagni di classe che lo deridono, i genitori che osteggiano la sua passione, non sono più un problema. Nella mente del ragazzo c’è solo lei, l’amore che viene dal mare, che gli dona la forza per ribellarsi agli altri, per contrastare un mondo ostile. Anche per lei sembra esistere solo Paul.</i></p><p style=""color: #337d7c;""><i>Ma questo legame speciale ha le sue ombre, i suoi riti: il sangue che lei pretende, le lacrime silenziose che senza un motivo apparente le solcano il viso, le squame sottili che si staccano dalla pelle diafana ogni volta che fanno l’amore e il latte dolcissimo che lei gli dona.</i></p><p style=""color: #337d7c;""><i>Forse quella fanciulla così effimera e bella, appartiene a un altro mondo. Forse, come le sirene che si allontanano troppo dall’acqua, soffre ad ogni passo come se una spada affilata le trapassasse quelle bizzarre estremità che noi umani chiamiamo gambe.</i></p><h3 style=""color: #337d7c;text-align: center;""> </h3><h3 style=""color: #337d7c;text-align: center;""><strong>THE STORY</strong></h3><p><i>There's an old bridge in the woods above the cliff. It's the favorite place of Paul, a solitary, introverted teenager with a talent that both isolates him and gives him immense pleasure: drawing.</i></p><p><i>On that bridge, Paul has an encounter which will change his life forever. From the sea emerges a beautiful and disturbing creature with a delicate long-limbed body and a gap between the two front teeth which are visible between her red lips. Naked and silent, the girl appears without warning. Paul thinks she must be mute, but during the night she speaks to him in a dream.</i></p><p><i>She comes and goes, through water and through dreams, consolidating each time a powerful feeling in the heart of the young man. She alone understands his sadness, she alone appreciates his creative soul, she alone knows who Paul really is.</i></p><p><i>Before long, the classmates who bully him and the parents who oppose his passion stop being a problem: in the boy's mind there is only her, the lover who comes from the sea, who gives him the strength to rebel and to fight back against a hostile world. And for her too, only Paul seems to exist.</i></p><p><i>But this special bond has its shadows, its rituals: the blood that she demands, the silent tears that for no apparent reason streak down her face, the thin scales which her diaphanous skin sheds each time they make love and the sweet milk that she feeds him. Perhaps that girl, so ephemeral and beautiful, belongs to another world. Perhaps, like the sirens that stray too far from the water, she suffers with each step as though a sword were piercing those bizarre extremities that we humans call legs.</i></p><h3 style=""color: #337d7c;text-align: center;""> </h3><h3 style=""color: #337d7c;text-align: center;"">PREVIEW</h3><p>Here's a preview of what Sirena will be:</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1541753661/b2idzosr54gak4rwxjdr.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1541753864/c8oidltwm7ngwqr6fst0.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1540939586/sn36obshz0l4gtj94utf.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3 style=""color: #337d7c;text-align: center;""> </h3><h3 style=""color: #337d7c;text-align: center;"">TEAM</h3><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1541436758/zqsjw6gwhki9jwwbxr9w.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""color: #337d7c;""><strong>CLAUDIO SCIARRONE:</strong> Disegnatore di fumetti con più di 20 anni di esperienza nell'industria dello spettacolo.

Borgazzi in collaborazione con Simona Fiori.Claudio Sciarrone ne cura i disegni e l' adattamento, illustrando la graphic novel che prenderà le forme di una fiaba dark.La nostra idea nasce dall’esigenza di sperimentare nuovi universi narrativi e per questo abbiamo deciso di creare una storia che possa diventare la genesi di un progetto transmediale indipendente: da un comicbook a un film.SIRENA sarà, infatti, il prequel, sottoforma di Graphic Novel, di un lungometraggio caratterizzato da una commistione di forme d’arte.Il nostro fine ultimo è quello di dare valore all’indipendenza artistica, nella quale crediamo moltissimo, creando una storia che abbia la capacità di appassionarvi e coinvolgervi al punto di non riuscire ad aspettare l'uscita del film!Abbiamo deciso di dare vita a questo progetto attraverso una campagna di crowdfunding perché siamo fermamente convinti che l’unico modo per dare il giusto rilievo alla Graphic Novel sia attraverso il supporto dei suoi veri sostenitori, voi lettori!Qualunque sarà il vostro contributo diventerete parte integrante ed essenziale del nostro piccolo grande sogno! ""Tormented by his peers, an adolescent falls madly in love with a mysterious girl who comes from the sea and who will change his life forever"".SIRENA is a dark fairytale conceived by the film writer/director Giorgio B. Borgazzi in collaboration with Simona Fiori and will be illustrated by the well-known comic artist Claudio Sciarrone.Our idea arises from the need to experiment with new narrative universes and for this reason we decided to create a story capable of becoming the genesis of an independent transmedia project: from a graphic novel to a movie.SIRENA will be the prequel, in the form of Graphic Novel, to a feature film characterized by a mixture of art forms. Our main purpose is to promote the independent art, to which we are totally committed, by creating a story so engaging and exciting that you can’t wait to see the movie!We decided to use a crowdfunding campaign to bring this project to life because we are firmly convinced that the only way to ensure SIRENA receives the attention it deserves, is through the help of its true supporters - the readers!Whatever your contribution, you will become an essential part of our little big dream! LA STORIAC’è un vecchio ponte malfermo nel bosco sopra la scogliera. Quel ponte sul mare è il luogo preferito di Paul, solitario e introverso adolescente, con un talento che lo eleva ma che lo rende solo, il disegno.In quel luogo sospeso, Paul fa un incontro che cambierà per sempre la sua vita. Proprio dal mare emerge una creatura bella e inquietante, dal corpo fragile e longilineo con un diastema tra le labbra rosse. La ragazza compare senza preavviso, senza abiti e senza voce. Paul la crede muta ma la notte gli parla in sogno. Va e viene attraverso l’acqua e i sogni, consolidando ogni volta un sentimento speciale nel cuore del giovane. Lei sola capisce le sue tristezze, lei sola apprezza il suo animo creativo, lei sola sa chi è davvero Paul. Ben presto, i compagni di classe che lo deridono, i genitori che osteggiano la sua passione, non sono più un problema. Nella mente del ragazzo c’è solo lei, l’amore che viene dal mare, che gli dona la forza per ribellarsi agli altri, per contrastare un mondo ostile. Anche per lei sembra esistere solo Paul.Ma questo legame speciale ha le sue ombre, i suoi riti: il sangue che lei pretende, le lacrime silenziose che senza un motivo apparente le solcano il viso, le squame sottili che si staccano dalla pelle diafana ogni volta che fanno l’amore e il latte dolcissimo che lei gli dona.Forse quella fanciulla così effimera e bella, appartiene a un altro mondo. Forse, come le sirene che si allontanano troppo dall’acqua, soffre ad ogni passo come se una spada affilata le trapassasse quelle bizzarre estremità che noi umani chiamiamo gambe. THE STORYThere's an old bridge in the woods above the cliff. It's the favorite place of Paul, a solitary, introverted teenager with a talent that both isolates him and gives him immense pleasure: drawing.On that bridge, Paul has an encounter which will change his life forever. From the sea emerges a beautiful and disturbing creature with a delicate long-limbed body and a gap between the two front teeth which are visible between her red lips. Naked and silent, the girl appears without warning. Paul thinks she must be mute, but during the night she speaks to him in a dream.She comes and goes, through water and through dreams, consolidating each time a powerful feeling in the heart of the young man. She alone understands his sadness, she alone appreciates his creative soul, she alone knows who Paul really is.Before long, the classmates who bully him and the parents who oppose his passion stop being a problem: in the boy's mind there is only her, the lover who comes from the sea, who gives him the strength to rebel and to fight back against a hostile world. And for her too, only Paul seems to exist.But this special bond has its shadows, its rituals: the blood that she demands, the silent tears that for no apparent reason streak down her face, the thin scales which her diaphanous skin sheds each time they make love and the sweet milk that she feeds him. Perhaps that girl, so ephemeral and beautiful, belongs to another world. Perhaps, like the sirens that stray too far from the water, she suffers with each step as though a sword were piercing those bizarre extremities that we humans call legs. PREVIEWHere's a preview of what Sirena will be: TEAMCLAUDIO SCIARRONE: Disegnatore di fumetti con più di 20 anni di esperienza nell'industria dello spettacolo.

<h3>Short Introduction to Kaytea Petro and <em>Gnometown</em>
</h3>
<p>I am a <a href=""http://www.kayteapetro.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">comic book creator and sculptor</a> based in San Francisco, CA. I lived in Mainland China in 2004-5, making comics there. During that time, I connected with art community there. Because of this, I have been invited by 943 Studio in Kunming to participate in an Artist-In-Residency during the winter of 2013, where I will be creating Volume 3 of my graphic novel <em>Gnometown</em>. Volume 3 tells the backstory of the gnomes' escape from war-torn Europe during World War II, life in China during the war, and eventual arrival in San Francisco in the late 1940's.</p>
<p><em>Gnometown</em> is the third <a href=""http://kayteapetro.net/Comix_and_Illustration_Home.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">full-length graphic novel project</a> that I have written and ilustrated. The overall story is a work of historical fiction, telling the story of garden gnomes that live in the abandoned movie theatres in San Francisco's historic Mission District. Steeped in global history, the <em>Gnometown</em> story references American immigrant experiences, and touches on social issues such as sexism, degradation of the natural environment, and inter-generational immigrant cultural conflict.</p>
<p>By helping to fund my Artist-In-Residency at 943 Studio, you will enable me to research and create the full backstory of the gnomes' lives during the war years - a story that mirrors the story of the European Jews that escaped to Shanghai and then inland during the war years. </p>

</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
<p><a href=""http://www.943studio.cn/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">943 Studio</a> is a new non-profit art space in Kunming, China. They do not have an endowment to support the artists they invite to be in residence; to participate, I need to fundraise for myself.</p>
<p>I need $6000 to support my Artist in Residency - plane tickets between San Francisco and Kunming (approximately $1600), residence and studio fees (approximately $4400). Unfortunately, China has gotten a lot more expensive than when I last lived there (plane ticket cost has doubled etc.).</p>
<p>Any additional funds over the goal will be spent on research-related expenses: travel costs to important historical sites in the story (such as a trip to document Shanghai's historical quarter), reproduction of historical photographs etc. If my funding goal is not met, I will augment the monies recieved with fundraisers in the SF area before the trip.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What You Get by Donating</h3>
<p>Anyone that donates to this project will get a credit printed in Gnometown, Volume 3. I also have a made a bunch of perks for funders at all levels. They range from printed matter to origional works of art created specifically for you.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Gnometown is the first lengthy graphic novel that I have written that is a work of fiction. Previous works have been autobiographical and taken years to complete (due to the limited nature of time when you're working full time for money). Gnometown is exciting for me as an artist because working in the genre of historical fantasy, I get to create a world and characters from scratch, based on historical research. It has enabled me to see the world differently and allows me to dig deeper into important historical moments.</p>
<p>When all the volumes of <em>Gnometown</em> are compiled into a larger graphic novel, it will be a sweeping story that will cause the reader to think more deeply about the world that is invisible yet surrounds them: what else could be both invisible and in plain view? It opens them up to the magical unknown of the world and consider the possibilities that might exist. The book also references many moments in human history that are largely unknown and unhearalded - the Mission Mile, the persistant water pollution near Jackass Flats, NV as a result of weapons testing between the 1940's and 90's, the experience of the 20,000 European Jews that escaped to China during Word War II as well as many others. It is my hope that the book will encourage people to educate themselves better about these historical moments.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I appreciate your help getting the word out about my project. Indiegogo has a variety of share tools to help you support me in the social space.</p>
<p>I would greatfully appreciate if you could use them to help spread the word about <em>Gnometown</em>.</p>

Musicians and band-mates they perfected their craft working their way up the local club scene in Los Angeles. Their music style was eclectic - always seeking to create what was not the norm. Their creativity did not stop with sound, however. Both talented visual artists, they would outfit concerts into total sensory experiences by creating and performing original music as well as transforming prestigious concert venues with all-encompassing art installations - to provide a total experience. Clothing and fashion were also on the boys’ radar, often repurposing and making their own clothing and accessories.  </p><p>After years in the music and art scene, they decided to launch a small, startup, family fashion business. Early collections gained attention from many world-renowned brands and they started designing and manufacturing for many established labels. This provided valuable opportunities to see inside many great companies and eventually give them the knowledge to be able to launch their own successful brand. </p><p>Enter HEX.  HEX is a creative community that draws from Dan and Trent's years of experience in fashion, music, and art and channels it to equip the next generation of creators through products that empower everyone to explore the outer limits of their potential. Everything HEX does is built on the foundation of its 3 core values of Innovation, Authenticity, and Community.</p></div>","At HEX, we are all about creativity and expression. In fact, our motto is ""Equip The Creators."" We are always looking to make people's lives better by focusing attention on often overlooked details or needs. We felt this was the case for the comic and art industry.Having a legendary artist like Jim Lee in your contact list helps alot. As Jim explained his difficulties in traveling with his supplies, we all realized there was a need here. So we worked together to create the ultimate travel backpack for artists,The HEX x Jim Lee Artist Backpack...

  This is why we believe these products are so revolutionary and so needed. We hope you will help us get these products out in the market in a big way. MODEL HEIGHT 5'10"" STAND-ALONE 11x17 PORTFOLIOIn response to popular demand, we have made the HEX x Jim Lee 11x17 Portfolio available as a stand-alone item!!!  This portfolio is the same portfolio that comes in the Artist Backpack (including the custom Jim Lee Batman sketch lining) , with the one exception that it is in a SOLID BLACK colorway.  
ABOUT HEX:Music originally brought founders Dan Maravilla and Trent Valladares together as teenagers living in Southern California. Musicians and band-mates they perfected their craft working their way up the local club scene in Los Angeles. Their music style was eclectic - always seeking to create what was not the norm. Their creativity did not stop with sound, however. Both talented visual artists, they would outfit concerts into total sensory experiences by creating and performing original music as well as transforming prestigious concert venues with all-encompassing art installations - to provide a total experience. Clothing and fashion were also on the boys’ radar, often repurposing and making their own clothing and accessories.  After years in the music and art scene, they decided to launch a small, startup, family fashion business. Early collections gained attention from many world-renowned brands and they started designing and manufacturing for many established labels. This provided valuable opportunities to see inside many great companies and eventually give them the knowledge to be able to launch their own successful brand. Enter HEX.  HEX is a creative community that draws from Dan and Trent's years of experience in fashion, music, and art and channels it to equip the next generation of creators through products that empower everyone to explore the outer limits of their potential. Everything HEX does is built on the foundation of its 3 core values of Innovation, Authenticity, and Community.",25.0,1,"2 Campaigns

<p><strong>ALOHA!</strong></p>
<p>I'm Manny from GoodDogPress.  Sit back, relax, and enjoy your time viewing the campaign for the unbreathable Skunk Girl : No Squirrels Allowed ! The unbreathable Skunk Girl is an homage to the great BADD girl comics of the 1990’s. It’s the story of Delilah Defluer, a shy, brainy, and awkward young lady who has an unfortunate accident  in her college years that turns her dull boring life up-side down. She will transform from a meek little girl into a bold, cunning young woman! It’s the ugly duckling story gone BADD! If you like ACTION and FUN, please support Skunkie as she takes on the Super Justice Wardens with the help of her “henchmen” Stink, Stank, Stunk, and the Booster Bois.</p>

ALOHA!
I'm Manny from GoodDogPress.  Sit back, relax, and enjoy your time viewing the campaign for the unbreathable Skunk Girl : No Squirrels Allowed ! The unbreathable Skunk Girl is an homage to the great BADD girl comics of the 1990’s. It’s the story of Delilah Defluer, a shy, brainy, and awkward young lady who has an unfortunate accident  in her college years that turns her dull boring life up-side down. She will transform from a meek little girl into a bold, cunning young woman! It’s the ugly duckling story gone BADD! If you like ACTION and FUN, please support Skunkie as she takes on the Super Justice Wardens with the help of her “henchmen” Stink, Stank, Stunk, and the Booster Bois.

Skunk Girl  is intended for Teens 13+ as it contains a LOT of violence, gunfire, smoking, drinking, and oh my lorrrd BEAUTIFUL women!

<h2>Where it goes</h2>
<h3>Funding raised will go to the printing of our book in both seperate chapters and as a full graphic novel. These will be used to send as perks of course but also to get printed books in front of publishers more than likely to be shopped at San Diego Comic Con. Any extra funding will partially go to the creators because after all of the work we deserve to buy ourselves a beer or two. But we will also use some for animated shorts and promotion. If our goal is not met, any monies made go directly to printing.</h3>

<h2>The Goal</h2>
<h3>Telling the story of Boudicca to a wide mainstream audience is not without it's challenges. Just writing and drawing a 120 page script is challenging enough. Our main goal is telling as wide of a scope as possible. To include the excitement of medievel battles aligned with the great loss responsible for the uprising of the Iceni people. It is our goal to show these events lead by a woman whose strength the world had not yet seen.</h3>

<h3>About The Project:</h3>
<p>Hi all, I'm Davide Racah.<br/>I'm an IT expert and I'm working as a producer in the videogame industry from 2008.</p>
<p>I always loved videogames, comics, anime, and many others nerdy things :)</p>
<p>In the last 2 years I've worked on a project that I strongly believe will work: the creation of a web platform to allow comics' authors to publish their works and gain money through the division (50% &amp; 50%) of the advertising revenue.</p>
<p>Comicsjump.net is half website and half social network: it's strictly connected to the ""new social aggregation media"" as Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin, Google+,  etc.</p>
<p>Personal connections is the key to move a lot of users on the platform and rise up the value of the entire platform, obtaining better advertising rating and rising a decent amount of money for the authors.</p>
<p>Comics' authors, especially newcomers, can easily reach millions of users around all the world, creating a solid background about their works, plus gain some money, that is always good!</p>
<p>Comics' authors will be always the only owners of their works: they will never sell to the platform any rights, they just allow the platform to publish their works for the digital parts in order to obtain views and divide the ads revenue.</p>
<p>Network is also a wonderfull example of <span class=""clickable""><span class=""forma"">meritocracy</span></span>: every result here depends only on the skills and efforts employed.</p>

Comics' authors, especially newcomers, can easily reach millions of users around all the world, creating a solid background about their works, plus gain some money, that is always good!
Comics' authors will be always the only owners of their works: they will never sell to the platform any rights, they just allow the platform to publish their works for the digital parts in order to obtain views and divide the ads revenue.
Network is also a wonderfull example of meritocracy: every result here depends only on the skills and efforts employed.
The core idea is really simple and in a lot of occasions, a simple idea works damned fine when you have skilled developers that work on it :)

These crazy guys work for the ""Officine Bianche"" (http://www.officinebianche.it/) an Italian cross-multimedia communication agency.
 This web based platform must be as much possible bulletproof and assure cutting edge performances for the users.The web developers show me how they works and the framework that they want to use: -> EZ publish <- was used to power and manage the video archive of the ESA (European Space Agency) and the performance showed are really impressive.This framework has to move tons of GB of data everyday with a minimum delay and not toast the server CPUs ;-)
This amout of money will cover:

Development cost
QA cost
SEO cost
Advertising campaing for the release of the platform
Estimated server (full hosting) expenses for 1 year
Estimated bandwidth plus back for 1 year

The domain www.comicsjump.net is already secured :)
With 3 months of development plus 1 month of heavy tests, this project can be completed and launched!
I'm aiming to have it ready and run for december 2012 in order to maximize all the efforts and strike with a big success.
Why I'm using the flexible funding option?Because even in the case that the goal of the project will not be reached, I can divide the development work in small modules (this will complicated things quite a bit) and start working on the core features of the platform. Leaving the development of the additional features after the release.
What You Get: AKA The Perks ^^;

Ben's laptop is a Dell XPS 13 developer edition. A featherweight, the 13 clocks in at just 2.6 pounds. Ben's new keyboard will weigh more than five times that, plus he'll still shoulder the weight of the actual computer.

Ben is expressly forbidden from using other keyboards (emergencies notwithstanding). The typewriter should significantly lower the 110 words-per-minute average he takes so much pride in. I'm not sure I can explain how hard for him this will be.

Where the $$$ goBase goals

$875 gets Ben a renovated Underwood typewriter (plus shipping and tax) from http://www.usbtypewriter.com/.  Here's the model Ben requested.  Meeting this goal guarantees that Ben will start a blog to document his burden. 

Stretch goals
$100 over the goal buys Ben a carrying case for the typewriter. Because c'mon, we're not that mean.

Above $1075
Above $1075,  donations go to cover the expenses for t-shirts and stickers. (Even if we don't make it above $1075, I will honor all the perks for qualifying donors.) 
Once expenses are covered, all additional donations will go directly to the Against Malaria Foundation, one of independent charity evaluator GiveWell's top-rated charities.

<p>Debuting on November 2, 2009, <em>A Broken Winter </em>is a long-running webcomic written by myself (Kale Night) and illustrated by Archie the Redcat, a professional comic book artist. The series contends with themes ranging from the corruption of authority to gay rights.</p>
<p>Archie is a commissioned artist, which means each page of the comic is paid for by me. I've managed to cope with this fairly well over the years, with the help of occasional donations from fans and friends. However, after an extended period of unemployment and an English degree I can't seem to do anything with, I need help funding the rest of the current story arc. By the time the arc is completed I hope to be in a better financial situation and back to funding the comic primarily on my own.</p>
<h2><strong>What Does This Mean?</strong></h2>
<p>There's a minimum of 65 pages left to go in order to complete the current story arc, which follows the life of Kokkan as a captive in a government slaughterhouse. The conclusion of this arc indicates the closure of this aspect of Kokkan's life and the beginning of another.</p>
<p>The cost of commissioning the required number of pages combined with hosting fees for the website are the basis of the fundraising total. Any money raised will go directly toward financing more pages for your viewing pleasure and keeping the website afloat.</p>
<h2><strong>Why Should You Donate?</strong></h2>
<p>If you're reading this, chances are you enjoy reading the comic. I hope that will be sufficient for some of you to feel inspired to see it continue to grow and remain free to read.</p>
<p>Not only are you helping me to finance a project that I hold very close to my heart, but keeping <em>A Broken Winter</em> going means continuing to draw attention to important issues like children who are negatively impacted by war and the denial of basic human rights to anyone who defies the heteronormative paradigm. This project means so much more to me than being able to see my work in a visual format, it means giving a voice to anyone who suffers as a result of oppression or mental illness.</p>
<p>I've tried to be creative with the incentives, given a lack of monetary resources, so hopefully they're still appealing enough to provide some degree of motivation.</p>
<p>If you're unable to donate, please help spread the word either by posting a link to the campaign or by promoting the website itself. Every bit helps. Thank you for reading and allowing <em>A Broken Winter</em> to come as far as it has. All it needs now it a little boost.</p>

<p><strong>Update (06/23/2013): </strong>Some of you may be aware of the flooding situation in Calgary and other parts of Southern Alberta. I was evacuated from the house I was renting (which is close to the Bow River) on the 20th and have yet to be allowed to return. I've been informed that the house is flooded with water and chances are high that I'll be forced to relocate.

It's about being young and away from home, and given freedoms, choices, responsibilities, and consequences. It's about the pressures that change people, and how stress can make you question your beliefs.</p>
<p>As this is a fairly large project, we will be spending much more time on it than on previous works. The money will go mainly to paying James so that he can spend his days creating this comic. The rest of the money will be spent on printing costs and supplying rewards to those of you who choose to help fund us. Any extra money we get will be spent giving James more time to work on each page, or if possible increasing the comic size. More money means we can add on an extra issue or two to the run!</p>
<p>Your contribution will make a difference! Both James and I are breaking into the comics field, and we're excited and motivated to create more and more comics. I've got a number of scripts that I'm preparing for the future, and by funding us on our initial venture you're encouraging new artists to create new work. You're changing the comics industry one comic at a time!</p>
<p>The New Recruits is a self-contained four issue story. One issue is not enough to convey the story and emotion that I intend. Both James and I are committed to completing all four issues.</p>
<p>Every dollar helps. We're going to make this project regardless of how much we make, as we fully intend to respect the rewards offered. Plus, every extra dollar will be put back into this project to make it the best that it can be. If you cannot contribute, please pass the word along that we're looking for help financially on this project, and that the final product will be fantastic!

If the campaign target is exceeded, the money will go towards printing a larger edition of the book, thus bringing it to an even larger audience! And of course I am already working on a sequel to the book, so any support will have a direct link to my future productivity.
Oh yeah, and it’ll make me feel all warm and fuzzy on the inside.Shut up and take my money! – Wait, PayPal?Indiegogo campaigns using euro as currency can only receive payments via PayPal, not via credit card.

<p>The purpose of this video is to promote my graphic novel: Blaze of Glory Iraq.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My name is James A. Bretney.  I am the writer, producer and illustrator of Blaze of Glory Iraq.  Blaze of Glory Iraq is an extension of the based on a true story youtube web-series  chronicling the saga of James LeRoy McCormick and the 518th Gun Truck Company - the most decorated convoy escort company during Operation Iraqi Freedom.  This campaign will raise $ 1,000 toward building an e-commerce website to digitally distribute the graphic novel ""Blaze of Glory Iraq.""</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is a story about an veteran of the Persian Gulf War who returns to fight a second Iraq War.  James McCormick faces three external conflicts: the Iraqi Insurgents who want to kill Americans, his own troops who look at their deployment as a vacation from their lives and their wives, and his own commanding officer who is more concerned about advancing his career than the safety of his soldiers.  Like I said it is a true story based on the public domain works of U.S. Army Transportation Historian Richard Killblane.  Richard Killblane wrote the ""The Filthy Thirteen and is himself a West Point graduate and Special Forces soldier.  I myself am an Iraq War veteran.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I collected war comics as a kid they introduced me to the war my grandfathers fought.  This story details heroism and cowardice, loyalty and betrayal and indomitability of the American fighting spirit.  Your contribution will enable people from all over the world to know this story - a story that needs to be told.  For after all, only the dead have seen the end of war.</p>

I'm an independent cartoonist with a B.F.A. in Sequential Art and over eight years of webcomics experience. You may remember me from the fundraiser I did last year to finance my short story comic collection, Ian Jay Super Comics Volume One. This year, I'm back with an even more ambitous project: turning my long-running webcomic<em> Epiphany</em> into a printed graphic novel.<br/><br/><em>Epiphany</em> is about Eli, a deer kid in high school with a lot of issues-- bad grades, careless friends, and a strained relationship with his preacher father, Henry. But when an errant truck puts Henry into critical condition, Eli seeks out Oscar, slacker ex-god of his family's religion, to help recover his father. Things don't go entirely as planned, and both Eli and Oscar will have to put everything they hold dear at risk in order to make things right again.<br/><br/>Although I've been publishing <em>Epiphany</em> online serially since 2008 (read it as it finishes up at <a href=""ianjay.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ianjay.net</a>), it's a story that's meant to be read as one continuous experience, not in drips and drops over the course of years. That's why, even before I started the series, I knew it would eventually need to be printed as a book-- it's the medium that best fits the content. Now that Epiphany is reaching its conlcusion, it's time to make that book a reality.<br/><br/><strong>What We Need</strong><br/><br/>The finished book will be 6 by 9 inches, 236 pages and in full color. Within those pages will not only be the entire comic run, but also sketches, annotated location references, a guest gallery and more. Gasch Printing of Odenton, MD has sent me a quote for $3797.34 for 300 copies using the book specifications I gave them, so I'm asking for an even <strong>$5000</strong>. Here's how I'm breaking down our 5K goal:<br/><br/>$3800 - printing the book.<br/>$600 - shipping pre-orders.<br/>$400 - donation perk merchandise.<br/>$200 - Indiegogo fees.<br/><br/>Shipping really bit into my stretch goal earnings during the last fundraiser I did, so this time around I want to make sure I leave enough of a budget to get every pre-order shipped. <br/><br/><strong>NOTE TO INTERNATIONAL DONATORS:</strong><br/>Shipping abroad costs more than it used to, and I can't add variable shipping options to Indiegogo's donation perks (at least, as far as I know). <strong>If you're ordering from outside the United States, please add an extra 10 to 15 dollars to your order, just to make sure I can ship your items to you safely.</strong><br/><br/>What You Get<br/><br/>We have a really incredible range of donation perks, including glow-in-the-dark and gold buttons, t-shirts, votive candles, and that ever-popular staple of fundraisers everywhere, tote bags. We're also selling off original inked artwork from the book, and providing all donation tier levels with high-resolution digital book copies. It's the biggest wave of new merchandise I've put out since... well, ever! And the more you donate, the more you get.<br/><br/>I feel like the most significant perk, though, is that starting at our $20 level, you can get your name (or pseudonym or alias of choice or whatever) printed in the book's Acknowledgements section. It might seem like an odd gesture to make, but <em>Epiphany</em> in general has always been a team effort. Drawing a comic isn't just about me shouting my ideas into the void; it's about you readers (and potential readers, of course) receiving those ideas and thinking about them within the individual contexts of your lives. Comics are a really intense collaborative experience between artists and readers, and printing this book is only another way that we're all banding together to help create something amazing. <br/><br/>Also it should go without saying that the books themselves will be so completely great. You'll be able to read <em>Epiphany</em> without a device or internet connection. You can put them on a bookshelf and marvel at how impressive and prestigious it makes your collection of books look. If you read it and don't like it, you can use it to kill insects or prop a wobbly table leg up or something, I don't know. IN ANY CASE: YOU'RE STILL A TEAM PLAYER.<br/><br/>How You Can Help, Besides Donating<br/><br/>I'm going to be absolutely screaming my head off about this fundraiser campaign until May 25th, but I can't possibly do it alone. I'll regularly be posting updates and news posts both here and on my progress blogs at <a href=""http://twitter.com/IanJay"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">twitter.com/IanJay</a> and <a href=""http://ianjay.tumblr.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://ianjay.tumblr.com</a>; any reposting, retweeting, reblogging or otherwise there will really help me out. Ian Jay Super Comics also has a Facebook fan page, in case you're more of a Facebook fan. <br/><br/>I can't emphasize enough, though, how important word of mouth is-- not just on social networking sites but person to person as well. <a href=""http://ianjay.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Go to my website</a>, read Epiphany, and if you like it, don't just stop at pre-ordering a book for yourself! Tell your friends! Blog about it, or bother other people's blogs about it! Recommend it to others who might even vaguely find it interesting, both online and ""in meat space""! It's really, really easy to get drowned out here, so let's make sure this project gets the attention it deserves. <br/><br/>Thanks for stopping by. Whether you're a long-time fan or a newcomer to Epiphany, whether you're donating a whole pile of money or only a few cents (or nothing at all), I really appreciate you taking the time to check out this project.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Pitch</h3>
<p>We are a husband and wife team with Atom on writing and voice duties and Hanji on animation. Animating Temp Tales is truly a labor of love and we hope to get some support for this latest episode so we can keep making them! Our dream is that one day we can make Temp Tales full time, but for now we're just focused on the next episode. The $1,000 budget is a fraction of what we would make doing commercial animations, which is how we make our living these days. It doesn't include the cost of writing, recording or to hire voice actors. It really only helps to cover some of the costs of the time it takes to animate the cartoon, which would be otherwise spent doing paying animation jobs. To break it down, a one-minute animation takes roughly about a week if we're gunnin it. This next cartoon will be over two minutes to give you an rough idea of the animation work involved. The script and audio recording are ready to go for this next cartoon, so all we need is your financial support and we'll be off and running. But if you don't have a cent to spare, please share this link and tell your friends!</p>

</div></div>","Velthaneus is a mature Sci-Fi comic. A hand-drawn debut from the creator, illustrator, and storyteller Ashley West. Enter a mad world filled with character expressions as extreme as their physical proportions. 
Welcome to the debut of Art of Velthaneus Volume 01, a 104-page collection of illustrations and concept art created between the years 2016-2019. Wait, there's more! The variant cover edition of Velthaneus Issue 01: Humanoid Psycho is dropping alongside the art book. Same 48 pages (32 story pages) of wacky interiors. Crazy new cover art. 
Meet Thane. He's strong. Stomping monsters and parkouring through the cavernous strata, he's unmatched. But, IT'S USELESS without the one in charge of his sex drive and FIGHTING SPIRIT...The id.
Finding his id means freedom, and Thane will be damned if he rots in hell. Consider the challenges conquered, so long as he resists the sensual Ellexa.


Art of Velthaneus Volume 01 and Velthaneus Issue 01 are finished products. Yay! However, the cost of printing is expensive. IndieGoGo enables a budget for this project. It's made possible from the support of an eager fanbase ready to experience a new animated-style indie series.

<h3><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Meet Dan Green</span></h3>
<p>Dan was a cop, and not a very good one. In fact, he was pretty much the worst cop in the worst precinct in the worst city in the world. Crooked and corrupt, Dan cared about nothing and no-one but himself, until the day he turned a blind eye to the kidnapping of a six-year-old girl. That night, lying in bed, Dan felt something he had no memory of feeling before.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Guilt.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The next morning, Dan knew what he had to do. He would find the girl and save her, and life could go back to normal again.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Three hours into the investigation, Dan was brutally murdered and dumped in a shallow grave. That would've been the end of it, only Dan didn't stay dead. Two weeks after being buried, Dan's reanimated corpse dragged itself free of the ground.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>And now Dan remembers it all. The girl. The investigation. The stab of hot steel cutting into his flesh, and the frantic, terrifying hopelessness as the soil came down over his face. Dan's mind is perfectly intact. Unfortunately his body is decomposing steadily, and if he is to have any hope of rescuing the missing girl, he's going to have to act fast.</p>

<p>GANGRENE is the brainchild of writer Barry Hutchison and artist Neil Chenier.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Barry is the author of the award-winning children's horror book series, INVISIBLE FIENDS, which is published by HarperCollins Children's Books. A comics fan from an early age, Barry came up with the idea for GANGRENE while being dismembered and buried alive by a gang of kidnappers.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>That was a lie. Sorry. He can't remember when he came up with it, but he's very happy that he did. Although he has written over 30 books, including several based on the hit cartoon series, BEN 10 and GENERATOR REX, GANGRENE will be Barry's first comic.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Neil, on the other hand, has substantially more comic-book experience. Based in Winnipeg, Canada, Neil has pencilled comics for a number of publishers and is in constant demand for comissions.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Completing the team are Travis Stephens on inks, Fran Ros on colouring duties, with Kel Nuttal doing the lettering work. They're all lovely, and if any of them ever met your mum struggling to carry lots of shopping, they'd all be happy to help her.</p>

<p>Of our $4000 target, around $1000 will be spent on marketing, including the cost of some of the Perks available to those who donate their hard cash. (See the column on the right for more details of what's up for grabs).</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The remaining $3000 will go towards paying our inker, colourist and letterer a page rate for the work they do. The rate will be well below what they would usually charge, but it will allow them to justify turning away full-paying work in order to complete GANGRENE. Neither Neil nor Barry will be taking any fee for the work they are doing, because Dan is their (hideously deformed) baby, and they're doing all this for the love of it.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>If we don't hit the target, it isn't the end of the world. The project can still continue, but it will be a much slower process and not to the standard it might otherwise have been had we raised all the money. Every penny you donate will allow us to produce a better comic in a shorter period of time, and the sooner we do that, the sooner we can get started.</p>

<h3><b>What stories does Zombie
International tell?</b></h3>
<p><b>Zombie
International </b>is an epic zombie saga that unfolds from episode to episode. The
first one <i>“All Undead On The Western
Front”</i>is set during the First
World War. Desperate to change the course of the war, the German high command
ordered a platoon of men to be injected with chemically modified snake poison in
the hope of them developing super human powers. However, instead, these guinea
pig soldiers turned into zombies longing for human flesh and blood. </p>
<p>Each following episode will take place in a different era, for
example the ancient world, the Dark Ages and the 21st century.</p>
<h3><b>What is our objective, who is
the target audience?</b></h3>
<p><b>Zombie International</b> is scheduled for release for the iPad and
other tablets <b>this autumn. </b>We
love the classic zombie movies essentially shaped by Romero and Fulci. In other
words: Our zombies are dumb and move slowly!</p>
<p>If you’re generally interested in comics, especially horror and
zombie comics, then Zombie International is perfect for you.</p>
<h3><b>Why should I support this project?</b></h3>
<p>We want to create something new: a comic that honors the masters
of the genre, but nonetheless tells an original story. Despite our attachment
to the zombie genre we aim to set a new standard in story telling.</p>

<h3><b>What will happen to your
donations?</b></h3>
<p>We have been working on this comic for more than two years. All
expenses have come out of our own pockets. Now, shortly before release, we are
facing new costs. Without exception, every donation will be used to finance the
App as well as additional production costs.</p>
<h3><b>Who are the guys behind Zombie

<p><b>Zombie International</b> belongs to Cappricorn Media UG, a start-up
publisher established specifically for this project. We have the illustrator
TimTonic on board for the artwork. Another member of our team is graphic
designer and musician Sascha Carl, aka Scalp, who is in charge of animation and
programming. Florian Schneider, aka The Swabian, is managing director of
Cappricorn Media and responsible as author for the story, dialogue and text.
The two journalists Dominik Drutschmann and Volker Schönenberger are
responsible for marketing and public relations. We are pleased to have
attracted Butch Loco of “The Reel Banditos” to compose the soundtrack for
the first episode. Last but not least, there is a whole bunch of other guys who
have also contributed to our ambitious project over the past two years. We
can’t name them all, but you’ll know who you are!</p>

together they can stop Lord Gordock and his reign of tyranny. However, this

Lady Rinka is a princess from the planet Ioni, and learns of the alien Lord
Gordock’s plan to invade her planet. To prevent this, she studies Earth’s
heroes to try to put a stop to Lord Gordock. However, when she arrives on
Earth, she learns that all of Earth’s superheroes only existed in things such
as movies and comic books. Luckily, she has a plan B. The power suits she made
for Earth’s heroes will not only help a select few, but will increase their
strength as well. Lady Rinka now must recruit a team of “heroes” so that
together they can stop Lord Gordock and his reign of tyranny. However, this
won’t be easy as two of Lord Gordock’s top ranked killers have followed Rinka
to Earth.

<h3>Hello!</h3>
<p>My name is Matt Jardin, i am a journalist and first time comic book writer from Massachusetts. I have been a fan of comics my whole life and love the fantasy genre.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>this campaign is to get the funds to complete the art work and lettering for the first issue of my comic, Knights of Fire. This is the first comic I have written and I really want to get it published for myself, and my daughter to show her that you can do anything you set your mind to.</p>
<p>contributors to this campaign mean everything to me and the campaign without contributors like you publishing this comic would not be possible.  It shows that you believe in the work I've done and hopefully become a fan of these characters that I love and want to keep alive.</p>
<p><br/>to get the book fully illustrated and lettered I am asking for $2,500 on this campaign.  as i said the funding will be going to an amazing artist who brought these characters to life in pages seen below and to get words on the pages.</p>
<p>I'm excited to offer some fun perks for contributing such as some behind the scenes stuff, a poster of the cover, thank you page mentions, and even possibly a character named after you in a future issue. obviously you'll also receive Knights of Fire Issue 1 and my undying gratitude</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If I fail to reach my goal rest assured the funds will still go to getting as much of the book ready to go as possible and I will try to finish on my own, or run anther campaign in the future with ore work finished.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This adventure comic following four friends who receive super powers not only entertains, it has great themes, winding tales, humor, and great action. the characters in this book are from all different walks of life and anyone can re;late to someone in the book.</p>
<p>This project is so important to me because it is really the first thing that I have created relying solely on my imagination. I have written articles and opinion pieces but this is the first thing I have to call my own 100% I wrote it to create a world that I would love to see in comics and hope you will too.</p>
<p>Your contribution will make my deem of being a comic creator come true</p>
<p>I have been working on this comic for 4 years now and have had a failed attempt at crowd funding before. I have had a little ore work done on it and hope that by investing in the project more on my own it is now ready for others to show interest in the project and contribute what they can.  I believe in this book and think that many people will enjoy what it has to offer.  the challenge for me will be the reach of the campaign. I have been taking some courses on social marketing so I am hoping this will help me reach a wider audience so I can brig this book to life and share it with you all.</p>
</div><div>If you can't contribute I totally understand.

Hi guys, my name is Marcus Day. You see, ever since I was a little child; I was able to draw; not good, but draw nonetheless. When I went to middle school; I stopped drawing altogether. It wasn't that I didn't like it, but it was more of an I didn't care for it anymore. That's when I got to high school and I went to an art class for the first time in a long time! When I got there, I was drawing, painting, and sculpting..  I hated my art teacher, because she was just mean and did not help any way shape or form. BUT! She did help me realize something; she helped me realized that I wanted to draw again. So a couple of weeks after being in that class, I finally went home, looked on YouTube of how to draw videos. I came across a Naruto how to video. Since it was my first time drawing, it took me 6 hours to complete! No joke, I timed myself. From there on, I continued YouTube drawing. And then I finally wanted to draw professionally. The next day, I went to Google and typed in pictures to draw. I then figured that I can do what most people can, which is sight drawing. I became a MASTER at it and I can draw anything from sight seeing. THEN next year while I was at school, one of my friends came up to me and asked me to draw pages from Naruto. (If you know manga, it goes from right to left, and my friend asked me if I could draw one chapter from Naruto.) I took his challenge and went home, pulled up a chapter, and drew every single page. It took me 10 hours to do, but I did it. I felt so proud of myself. I was able to do one chapter; woohoo! When I went to school the next day, I showed him. He was amazed at what he saw. Then he asked me: hey man, you should be a comic book artist, and it hit me like a sack of potatoes. My mind came was like: Wow Marcus, you can do this, you can. And I thought about it more and more! It became a part of me. I was going to do it. The VERY NEXT DAY, I tried to create a character and I realized one problem. I didn't know how to draw from my mind; it was frustrating (and still is) I didn't know what to do and I was extremely sad. I couldn't believe how many drawings I did (over 200) was all for nothing. I didn't know how to draw from my imagination. Awful. Very awful. I went to YouTube and looked up how to draw hoping that I can find something that will help me be able to draw like professionals in just one day. But sadly, it is not like that. It takes years to master. Go for me; ever since then I have been drawing for years to come. I have gotten SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER! It's not too hard anymore but it still causes me some problems. And now; I am going to college in a few weeks to major in art. My mother is not able to pay for my college courses. I only have a few scholarships and the rest are loans. I don't want to be in debt when I get out of college. That CAN'T happen! I don't want that to happen! I want to go to college without worrying about getting kicked out of college because I don't have enough money. I will explain my comic below<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Reason why I want to make my comic - Twins<br/>
</h3>I want to explain to you why I want to make my comic. And no, it is not to make money, far from it. I want to change the world with my comic. Yes, the entire world. I know it's a big claim but you will understand why I want to. <br/><br/>I have a friend right? We always talk about Philosophical stuff. ALWAYS! Every time we have a conversation, it is philosophical. What do we talk about? EVERYTHING! We talk about the universe, earth, life, what the world really is, secrets of everything and much more. Trust me, I can't explain to you how deep it is but if you were there, you would know how amazing it is. I want to add everything we talk about into my comic. I want to show secrets of humans being and everything in my comic. There are many things I will show you that could possibly blow your mind. My comic won't be like the typical comics you see everyday. It will be different. However; when you think of superpowers and such, it will that of course (What comic doesn't!?) But the powers will be some you hear about everyday, but explained differently. <br/><br/>Not only will I be adding that in my comic, but I will also be put my life experiences in my comic. Yes, you will get to know a lot about me in my comic. You may be asking? ""Why are you so special?"" Well, to tell you the truth, I am not special; every single human is special in their own way. When you read or watch comics, you won't get information about the creator's life right? May be you will, but I will not let one single slip of my life slip by in my comic. I will add everything! I want my comic to change the world with information that seems to be hidden from people. Of course, I don't have information. But what I will add in my comic is the 'possible secrets' of the world. I want people to take all of it in consideration and view the world differently. The world is evil and I want to change that for the better.<br/><br/>I don't have the education to start making my comic and I know college will. I will also need programs that cost over thousands of dollars and materials to start making my comic. And that is a lot. Even after I get my go through college, it will still be hard to get materials for my comics. And I know I won't have thousands to spend when making my comic. If I don't reach my funding goal, then I will put whatever I have into my comic. Every little will count.<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>I want to change the world with my comic as I explained earlier. You guys will help me change the world. I truly believe I can. It seems repetitive to me because I say it over and over. Do you guys want to change the world as well? For the better? Not the worst. That is how I feel. Actually, the money in making my comic is the most important part to me. It is the factor of how it will affect the world. I want it to be big! I want everyone to know! You guys can help with that by spreading as well. I will still need the materials and programs to start it. I will not let you guys down! I will continue on until I can make this comic. I will never give up; Dedication is key; having a passion is key; making my goals a reality is a must!<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>I know it will be hard to start learning how to draw. But it will be something worthwhile. It may be a while before I can actually start my comic. I have general information about drawing; it has become easier; but I know I can still do a lot better with it. It will change the world; it will make people think differently about the world. The challenges will be worthwhile<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>Please! If you can't contribute; no biggie. But PLEASE! Please share with the people that you know that will be interested in it. If you have friends.

</div></div>","Short SummaryYes! It means we're changing the world. Let me explain more about myself! Hi guys, my name is Marcus Day. You see, ever since I was a little child; I was able to draw; not good, but draw nonetheless. When I went to middle school; I stopped drawing altogether. It wasn't that I didn't like it, but it was more of an I didn't care for it anymore. That's when I got to high school and I went to an art class for the first time in a long time! When I got there, I was drawing, painting, and sculpting..  I hated my art teacher, because she was just mean and did not help any way shape or form. BUT! She did help me realize something; she helped me realized that I wanted to draw again. So a couple of weeks after being in that class, I finally went home, looked on YouTube of how to draw videos. I came across a Naruto how to video. Since it was my first time drawing, it took me 6 hours to complete! No joke, I timed myself. From there on, I continued YouTube drawing. And then I finally wanted to draw professionally. The next day, I went to Google and typed in pictures to draw. I then figured that I can do what most people can, which is sight drawing. I became a MASTER at it and I can draw anything from sight seeing. THEN next year while I was at school, one of my friends came up to me and asked me to draw pages from Naruto. (If you know manga, it goes from right to left, and my friend asked me if I could draw one chapter from Naruto.) I took his challenge and went home, pulled up a chapter, and drew every single page. It took me 10 hours to do, but I did it. I felt so proud of myself. I was able to do one chapter; woohoo! When I went to school the next day, I showed him. He was amazed at what he saw. Then he asked me: hey man, you should be a comic book artist, and it hit me like a sack of potatoes. My mind came was like: Wow Marcus, you can do this, you can. And I thought about it more and more! It became a part of me. I was going to do it. The VERY NEXT DAY, I tried to create a character and I realized one problem. I didn't know how to draw from my mind; it was frustrating (and still is) I didn't know what to do and I was extremely sad. I couldn't believe how many drawings I did (over 200) was all for nothing. I didn't know how to draw from my imagination. Awful. Very awful. I went to YouTube and looked up how to draw hoping that I can find something that will help me be able to draw like professionals in just one day. But sadly, it is not like that. It takes years to master. Go for me; ever since then I have been drawing for years to come. I have gotten SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER! It's not too hard anymore but it still causes me some problems. And now; I am going to college in a few weeks to major in art. My mother is not able to pay for my college courses. I only have a few scholarships and the rest are loans. I don't want to be in debt when I get out of college. That CAN'T happen! I don't want that to happen! I want to go to college without worrying about getting kicked out of college because I don't have enough money. I will explain my comic below
  Reason why I want to make my comic - Twins
I want to explain to you why I want to make my comic. And no, it is not to make money, far from it. I want to change the world with my comic. Yes, the entire world. I know it's a big claim but you will understand why I want to. I have a friend right? We always talk about Philosophical stuff. ALWAYS! Every time we have a conversation, it is philosophical. What do we talk about? EVERYTHING! We talk about the universe, earth, life, what the world really is, secrets of everything and much more. Trust me, I can't explain to you how deep it is but if you were there, you would know how amazing it is. I want to add everything we talk about into my comic. I want to show secrets of humans being and everything in my comic. There are many things I will show you that could possibly blow your mind. My comic won't be like the typical comics you see everyday. It will be different. However; when you think of superpowers and such, it will that of course (What comic doesn't!?) But the powers will be some you hear about everyday, but explained differently. Not only will I be adding that in my comic, but I will also be put my life experiences in my comic. Yes, you will get to know a lot about me in my comic. You may be asking? ""Why are you so special?"" Well, to tell you the truth, I am not special; every single human is special in their own way. When you read or watch comics, you won't get information about the creator's life right? May be you will, but I will not let one single slip of my life slip by in my comic. I will add everything! I want my comic to change the world with information that seems to be hidden from people. Of course, I don't have information. But what I will add in my comic is the 'possible secrets' of the world. I want people to take all of it in consideration and view the world differently. The world is evil and I want to change that for the better.I don't have the education to start making my comic and I know college will. I will also need programs that cost over thousands of dollars and materials to start making my comic. And that is a lot. Even after I get my go through college, it will still be hard to get materials for my comics. And I know I won't have thousands to spend when making my comic. If I don't reach my funding goal, then I will put whatever I have into my comic. Every little will count.
  The ImpactI want to change the world with my comic as I explained earlier. You guys will help me change the world. I truly believe I can. It seems repetitive to me because I say it over and over. Do you guys want to change the world as well? For the better? Not the worst. That is how I feel. Actually, the money in making my comic is the most important part to me. It is the factor of how it will affect the world. I want it to be big! I want everyone to know! You guys can help with that by spreading as well. I will still need the materials and programs to start it. I will not let you guys down! I will continue on until I can make this comic. I will never give up; Dedication is key; having a passion is key; making my goals a reality is a must!
  Risks & ChallengesI know it will be hard to start learning how to draw. But it will be something worthwhile. It may be a while before I can actually start my comic. I have general information about drawing; it has become easier; but I know I can still do a lot better with it. It will change the world; it will make people think differently about the world. The challenges will be worthwhile

I don't, but she's going to get it whether I want to or not. I'm ground down to a nub emotionally. This campaign is under the ""Comic"" category, but this clown has tears flowing.</p> <ul>
<li>My name's Joseph Barrow, and I'm looking for a unique way to move on.</li> <li>My marriage lasted for eight and a half years, and as of the time of this writing, has a week left. I'm raising money from any interested parties to fund a get-together (she is getting the majority of the marital assets) and maybe I can start fresh when I start over.</li> <li>I can say that right now, I'm heartbroken, mad, upset, emotional, ticked off - the gamut of emotions. With this party, maybe I can meet someone that can help me start to heal the hole in my heart.</li> </ul>
<p>I still love my wife dearly. When we got married, she was the most beautiful thing on God's green earth, to me. No matter how upset I might be, no matter how mad I might be, no matter how many tears I shed, she is my beloved wife. I know myself well enough to know that being alone is anathema to me. But she's gone. Finished. Left the station, and not looking back at my shredded heart. So to protect what's left of my heart, I need to close that door in my life and maybe I can find another door to open and walk right through. </p> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Let's see if I can run some details:</p> <ul>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">I put $2500 down.  That would pay for a night's rental of either the Legion Hall and catering, or being able to take family out to Red Lobster, with gasoline in all their cars to get there. If any of my other cousins are involved, I'll have to tell them, ""No strip joints."" I don't think I'm ready for that. Also, the refrigerator in the house I'm staying at is broke, so the beer and Coca-Cola is warm. So is the three-day old pizza, and the hot sauce is okay, but it's bubbling.</span><br/>
</li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">I have a lot of physical pain from an automobile accident, which makes it hard to convince prospective employers to hire me. I'm truthful in those sections that ask, ""do you have any physical disabilities that would limit your ability to perform your job?"" If I didn't answer truthfully, that would be a reason to get fired quickly, and then where would I be? Right back here.</span></li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Plus, with no job and income, I have no health insurance. With no health insurance, I have no way to get grief counseling. I might be writing these sections in a painfully humorous way, but seriously, I am so emotionally unsettled and in need of counseling.</span></li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Or, a good woman.</span></li> <li>I have set up flexible funding, meaning that if there are donations, I will pay a fee, and keep what is donated. If the goal is missed, the missed goal funds will go toward what is now my rent and utilities, since my soon-to-be-ex-wife has the paid-off house in her name. Also, food and sustenance. If the goal is met, I will use the funds as stated above.</li> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>It's amazing the kind of things that you think of when you're too worn out from the tears and sobbing.  I would like to be able to at least have a leg up on the monumental task of starting over.  My wife called me to tell me she wanted a divorce a few days after I was fired from my job. The only income I have is the breeze in the windows. Your contribution will make a difference for my state of mind for a while, and will help me to help others who worry about me feel a little better for a while.</p> <ul>
<li>This project is important to me on a personal level. Even with a week left in my marriage, I still go to bed with her on my mind, and wake up with her name on my lips. My daily prayers are for her first, and myself second.</li> <li>I am serious about trying to pull myself up, but I am realistic enough to know that I'm going to need help. My family is helping, but they have their own problems.</li> <li>It's going to take me a long, long time to get over her. She was my light, my love, the stars in my sky, and the sands on my beach shore.</li> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>The risks are the same for anything on the Internet. The obstacles are that there would be people with apathy without a desire to help. Five or ten dollars at a time. Go without Starbucks for a day. Bring a sandwich from home, and pass up the McDonald's.</p> <ul>
<li>I'm qualified because I'm stubborn. I'm aware that I need to move on, and I'm also aware that I can't without some help to do it.</li> <li>My planning is to set up this page, watch carefully, answer any questions.</li> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If you can't help monetarily toward my goal, there are other ways:</p> <ul>
<li>Be the word of mouth about this campaign. Spread the word, spread the links on social media, or for that matter, national news.</li> <li>Speaking of social media, use the Indiegogo share tools!</li> </ul>

If the goal is missed, the missed goal funds will go toward what is now my rent and utilities, since my soon-to-be-ex-wife has the paid-off house in her name. Also, food and sustenance. If the goal is met, I will use the funds as stated above. 
  The Impact It's amazing the kind of things that you think of when you're too worn out from the tears and sobbing.  I would like to be able to at least have a leg up on the monumental task of starting over.  My wife called me to tell me she wanted a divorce a few days after I was fired from my job. The only income I have is the breeze in the windows. Your contribution will make a difference for my state of mind for a while, and will help me to help others who worry about me feel a little better for a while. 
This project is important to me on a personal level. Even with a week left in my marriage, I still go to bed with her on my mind, and wake up with her name on my lips. My daily prayers are for her first, and myself second. I am serious about trying to pull myself up, but I am realistic enough to know that I'm going to need help. My family is helping, but they have their own problems. It's going to take me a long, long time to get over her. She was my light, my love, the stars in my sky, and the sands on my beach shore. 
  Risks & Challenges The risks are the same for anything on the Internet. The obstacles are that there would be people with apathy without a desire to help. Five or ten dollars at a time. Go without Starbucks for a day. Bring a sandwich from home, and pass up the McDonald's. 
I'm qualified because I'm stubborn. I'm aware that I need to move on, and I'm also aware that I can't without some help to do it. My planning is to set up this page, watch carefully, answer any questions. 
  Other Ways You Can Help If you can't help monetarily toward my goal, there are other ways:

<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>A 12-episode graphic novel about a reluctant superhero yogini who battles abusive police and government agents without the aid of violence. You can see the first episode <a href=""http://www.cultural-nomad.com/urban/photo-album/episode-1.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</p>
<p>When is it acceptable to use violence? Can we fight violence without resorting to violence ourselves? Is violence legitimate when it is committed by those in authority? And what can one person do to combat officially sanctioned violence - when she can't use violence herself?</p>
<p>These are the questions posed by Urban Yogini. They are also critical questions for those of us who are committed to peace and to creating a peaceful society. I decided to create this web comic and graphic novel in order to get people asking these questions, and possibly even coming up with some solutions.</p>
<p>I was a journalist for over a decade, mostly in Asia. I have also studied yoga, ballet and some buddhism. You can see my writing and other work <a href=""http://www.bretigne.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The $4,000 will go to pay professional artists to do a better job illustrating the remaining eleven episodes than I have done with the first. It will also free me up to write those episodes if somebody else is doing the artwork.</p>
<p>I'm offering some pretty cool perks to those who donate:</p>
<p>EVERYONE who donates will get a copy of the finished product - the 12-episode graphic novel. Anyone donating $20 or more will get a signed copy.</p>
<p>Anyone who donates $100 or more can have their name appear as the name of a character in one of the episodes.</p>
<p>And for anyone who donates $1,000 or more, I will create a supervillain in your image and using your name (that is, a supervillain version of your name). I personally think this is the coolest perk ever. </p>
<p>Anything raised beyond $4,000 will go to pay me for my time writing the episodes. If the campaign brings in a LOT more than $4,000 ($8,000 or more), then additional funds will go to fund even more episodes! And of course if the campaign doesn't raise the full amount, I will use whatever funds are raised to make as many episodes as we can.</p>

<p>Years ago, Captain James Ellis and the USN Ballistic Missile Submarine Hammerhead were presumed lost at sea.  But now, somehow, they have returned, and the outcome could be tense.  A navy wants its sub back.  A captain's wife wants her husband back.  But after years of adapting to life at sea, can they come back?</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Previously previewed in Heavy Metal Magazine's September 2010 issue, you can now see the entire book digitally.</p>
<p>Eisner-nominated for Clive Barker's Tapping the Vein series, I've created a new tale in the style of my work for Twisted Tales, Tales of Terror, Alien Encounters, and Twilight Zone, to name a few. </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Pitch</h3>
<p>I believe Off the Deep End has potential as an ongoing series.  But realistically, comic work costs hundreds of dollars a page.  I think Off the Deep End is worth it.  Download the pdfs and decide for yourself.  I'm hoping to earn more than my goal so I can pay my artist to create at least enough pages to create the finale of the story.</p>
<p><br/>If you prefer a paper comic, you may order the entire book from indyplanet.com, or you can purchase one of the copies with my autograph.  (While you're at it, and if you like horror, you can also check out my ebooks on Smashwords.com!)</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Athens: the comic book #1 was a collection of short stories inspired by Athens - the chaos, the beauty, the darkness, diversity and hope found in this great city. We sent an open call for stories, gave freedom to participants to choose their theme, and received 16 fantastic, romantic, realistic, social, and above all true experiences. The book was printed in the autumn of 2015.</p>
<p>2 years later, the political and social situation is quite different, and Athenian's state of mind too. We wanted to make a new antology, but more curated, with more social content, and longer stories . That was the main idea behind the second call.</p>

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p><i>NIKOLAI</i> is the authorized comic biography of Croatian wrestling legend, Nikolai Volkoff, 2005 WWE Hall of Famer, former WWF Tag Team Champion, and former partner of the Iron Sheik! Along with Bruno Sammartino, Nikolai was the first professional wrestler to sell out Madison Square Garden. Written by John Crowther (Antarctic Press' <i>Rochelle</i>), this story of Nikolai's life is based on in-depth interviews and intimate conversations between the writer and the wrestler.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Nikolai (aka Josip Peruzovic) passed away unexpectedly in July of 2018. During the comic production process, he became a friend to us all at Inverse Press/Squared Circle Comics. He called often, just to chat, and we felt his loss tremendously.

NIKOLAI is the authorized comic biography of Croatian wrestling legend, Nikolai Volkoff, 2005 WWE Hall of Famer, former WWF Tag Team Champion, and former partner of the Iron Sheik! Along with Bruno Sammartino, Nikolai was the first professional wrestler to sell out Madison Square Garden. Written by John Crowther (Antarctic Press' Rochelle), this story of Nikolai's life is based on in-depth interviews and intimate conversations between the writer and the wrestler.
Unfortunately, Nikolai (aka Josip Peruzovic) passed away unexpectedly in July of 2018. During the comic production process, he became a friend to us all at Inverse Press/Squared Circle Comics. He called often, just to chat, and we felt his loss tremendously. We've been making comics since 2010 - and wrestling comics since 2016 - and his was the very first of those wrestling stories we were privileged to tell. We're proud to say that he read and approved every page of this book before his death. It's his official biography.

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"">Hi, we're Laura Ellyn and Jane Dough. We're here to talk to you about a graphic novel project that we're really excited about and we need your support to make happen.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"">Both of us are university students in Montreal, Quebec, and for the last several months, we've been on strike in protest of the Charest government's plans to raise tuition in Quebec by almost 80% over the next few years. We've seen the student movement in Quebec grow from localized protests to a massive movement with international support, effectively changing the landscape of university life and politics in Quebec drastically over a relatively short amount of time. For many students, university staff and professors, and Quebec residents in general, the past several months have been a time of great political turmoil, passionate public debates, community organization and solidarity, police and government repression, and all too often, physical violence as well. The cost of the “Maple Spring” to the Canadian government has been millions of dollars, while the cost to students and Quebec residents has been freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, and in some cases, the ability to attend school altogether.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"">We have both been on the front lines of student organizing since the strike reached our university, Concordia, one of the few anglophone institutions in Quebec. Being so directly involved in the strike – picketing, holding meetings, marching, occupying, arguing, putting our academic careers, our physical and mental health, and our relationships with friends and loved ones on the line – has been an intense and sometimes overwhelming experience for us both. We each started making comics about the Maple Spring as a way of processing the things we were seeing and experiencing as student activists. We decided to collaborate on a full-length graphic novel, documenting not only our personal journeys and experiences in the strike, but the history of student and union organizing in Quebec, and what the current situation means for the future of the Canadian left.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;""><img alt=""two panels from a comic page. Text reads: The monthly fine arts strike GA didn't make quorum. People were frustrated and disappointed.

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;""><strong>The Book</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"">En Greve is scheduled to be released in September of 2012 and be carried by independent bookstores and zine distros. Because of the personal and political nature of the book, it is important to us that it be published in a way where we can maintain a large degree of autonomy and control over the production. We initially looked into working with a publisher, but after some discussion, we decided that self-publishing was the way to go. This means that the project will be a lot more labour-intensive and expensive for us, but we can put all of our effort into making beautiful, high-quality, and uncensored works of political art. Each 100-page book will be hand-bound and feature a hand-printed cover. We will also be releasing a series of cards and patches with messages of student solidarity and the right to accessible education for all.</p>

Getting my books published was a huge milestone in my life, but I don't want it to stop there.  My goal is to keep making comics as long as I am alive and I've got a lot of story and script already in the works.  I have already had some success with over 200 readers of my previous books and know they want to read the continuation.My wife Annie and I have been married for 15 years and we have three awesome daughters and a newborn son; Ryleigh Jo, Shandee,  Kara, and Johnny.  We live in a very small town in Utah called Riverside and are surrounded by family.  I work for a large food distribution warehouse full time, substitute in my school district, and occasionally weed eat my local cemetery. Those are the main reasons I am doing a campaign.  With a full time job and two side jobs I still struggle to be able to get my books out and buy the equipment I need to work on it.  It means the world to me that you are reading this and are interested in helping me reach my dreams.    What I Need & What You Get How you help me: 
Your contribution will help me get the art supplies I draw with, a laptop, and programs that I use to make my books.    You will also be helping me with the printing costs, shipping and packaging, promotional expenses, and all the other stuff that go into making comics.  And also, hopefully, it will help my wife see how making comics is more than just an expensive hobby.   The Perks! There's a lot in it for you too: 
I know that you all want issue 3, but I understand that some of you may want the full story and issues 1 and 2 will be available as some of the perks. Have you wanted to see your ad for your book, shop, or thing in a comic book?  That will be available in the highest perk option. Even if I do not make my goal your contribution and aid has helped me and your perks will be sent out. 
When I do reach my goal everyone who opted for the $25.oo, $50.oo, and $100.oo PERKS will also have a Rentnarb Studios Comics tee added to their shipment!

</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>Issue 3 of Arise continues the story of Dinah and her lethal protector
Thanatos as they plunge through a zombie ridden city.</p><p></p><p></p>
<p><b><em>What is Arise?</em></b></p>
<p>Arise is the story of a lone warrior, Thanatos, and his companion, Dinah,
trying to battle their way through a zombie infested town. Thanatos' goal is to
survive long enough to get to his home - a heavily fortified safe zone that was
designed for the inevitable zombie apocalypse. See, Thanatos isn't your average
person. He's a conspiracy theorist who believed that the zombie invasion was
coming.  ...And he was right.</p>
<p>Arise is an intellectual property held by Satyrn Studios, an entertainment
company based out of the DFW region in Texas. Arise is starting off as a
six-issue limited comic book series that will be turned into a graphic novel
upon completion of the series. The Arise IP will go beyond the comic and span
into the realm of film, video games, action figures, and more. Currently, there
is a short film already released and a video game underway. The first issue of
the Arise comic book is already completed. The series is written by Satyrn
Studios owner Jay Reiter. The artwork for the first issue was done by legendary
horror artist Vince Locke (<a href=""http://vincelocke.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://vincelocke.com/</a>),
with colors done by Lauren Affe. The second through sixth issues will have
artwork by James Whynot and colors by Jay Reiter.</p>
<p><b><em>What is the goal of this crowd funding campaign?  </em></b></p>
<p>The monetary goal of $1,000 is to fund the third issue of the six-issue
limited comic series.  Any money donated above the $1,000 will go towards
funding the remaining issues of the series, printing costs, etc. If this campaign is successful enough to go
beyond funding the entire comic series, any additional funds will go back into
the Arise franchise. The next step for the Arise franchise is to complete the
Arise video game which will be ported to Xbox live, iPhones/iPads/iPods, and
Android devices. Action figures will
follow.  An Arise animated series is also in the works.  One of the
last steps for the Arise franchise will be the creation of a full feature
length live-action motion picture.  This will take a minimum budget of
$250,000 to fund, over-and-above the costs of funding the comics and other
aspects of the Arise IP.</p>

Thanatos as they plunge through a zombie ridden city.
What is Arise?
Arise is the story of a lone warrior, Thanatos, and his companion, Dinah,
trying to battle their way through a zombie infested town. Thanatos' goal is to
survive long enough to get to his home - a heavily fortified safe zone that was
designed for the inevitable zombie apocalypse. See, Thanatos isn't your average
person. He's a conspiracy theorist who believed that the zombie invasion was
coming.  ...And he was right.
Arise is an intellectual property held by Satyrn Studios, an entertainment
company based out of the DFW region in Texas. Arise is starting off as a
six-issue limited comic book series that will be turned into a graphic novel
upon completion of the series. The Arise IP will go beyond the comic and span
into the realm of film, video games, action figures, and more. Currently, there
is a short film already released and a video game underway. The first issue of
the Arise comic book is already completed. The series is written by Satyrn
Studios owner Jay Reiter. The artwork for the first issue was done by legendary
horror artist Vince Locke (http://vincelocke.com/),
with colors done by Lauren Affe. The second through sixth issues will have
artwork by James Whynot and colors by Jay Reiter.
What is the goal of this crowd funding campaign?  
The monetary goal of $1,000 is to fund the third issue of the six-issue
limited comic series.  Any money donated above the $1,000 will go towards
funding the remaining issues of the series, printing costs, etc. If this campaign is successful enough to go
beyond funding the entire comic series, any additional funds will go back into
the Arise franchise. The next step for the Arise franchise is to complete the
Arise video game which will be ported to Xbox live, iPhones/iPads/iPods, and
Android devices. Action figures will
follow.  An Arise animated series is also in the works.  One of the
last steps for the Arise franchise will be the creation of a full feature
length live-action motion picture.  This will take a minimum budget of
$250,000 to fund, over-and-above the costs of funding the comics and other
aspects of the Arise IP.
What are the rewards for the campaign?  *Make sure you let me know which item(s) you want specifically for the rewards that have more than one option!*

<h3>Gimme the Deets!</h3>
<p>Hi!</p>
<p>I'm Matt Cummings, an illustrator from Nova Scotia, Canada. Over the past few years, I've written and drawn a comic series called Bluenose, which you can find over at <a href=""http://www.bluenosecomic.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.bluenosecomic.ca</a> </p>
<p>Last year, I created my first ever mini-comic, starring the Bluenose cast. It was a labour of love and turned out really great! This year, I'd like to take it to the next level, with a collection of 3 new stories which continue where the first left off. <strong>In addition, the entire first mini-comic story will be included, making this <em>the graphic novel of mini-comics!</em></strong> :0</p>
<p>A whopping <em><strong>60 pages</strong></em> of comics is planned and ready to be brought to life. And that's not all! I have ambitions here, and they don't stop at comics alone! There will be pin-ups, illustrations, fanart, and <strong>A TABLE OF CONTENTS! Whoa!</strong></p>
<p>It promises to be the cutest book on your shelf.</p>
<p>This campaign will also serve as my gateway to the Toronto Comic Arts Festival in May! It's a gathering of some of the friendliest folks in the art and comics worlds and, after attending last year, one of the places I'd most like to revist. I'll be bringing my books with me to give to folks so if you buy one here, tell me and I'll give it to you <em><strong>in  p e r s o n !</strong></em></p>

<h3>What I Need And What You Get!</h3>
<p>The $1300 I need will go to a few key things! Simply put, book-making costs (from lulu.com!), shipping materials/costs (built into the price of your donations!) and travel/accomodations for TCAF!</p>
<p>After checking all the fancy options around, my comics friends have directed me to lulu.com for my book-making needs. They have the best balance of quality supplies and print detail to costs. The book will be perfect bound in A5 size and should tuck handsomely into any and all book shelves, coat pockets and rolled up pant cuffs.</p>
<p>For the initial run of the book, I'll making 70 books minimum. To cover this, it'll be $300-$400, roughly (depending on final page count). If I end up getting more donations than expected, the number of books goes up, up, up!!</p>
<p>Travel to and from TCAF will be $390 (THANK GOODNESS FOR flyporter.com!!) and hotel costs will be $450 for the weekend.</p>
<p>The last bit is to cover IndieGoGo's fees~ (:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>And you get?</strong> OHO! Well, a book for starters, if you donate $25 and above!</p>

<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Why a Reboot?</span></p>
<p>There are many reasons I decided to reboot this story. If I gave them all at once, this simple explanation would possibly become a full novel, so I will give you a few of the reasons at the forefront.</p>
<p>First, somewhere along the way in the originals, I lost sight of what I wanted to do with the main characters. Those characters being Ra'ek (The Lowlife) and Nis'si. Though they were the backbone of the story, I was spending more time developing supporting characters just to move the pair's plot line along. As I worked on the script for the third issue, I began to realize that I was creating even MORE characters to move the story forward, I decided it was time to take a step back and reconsider the direction I was going as my main characters had no personalities of their own.</p>
<p>Secondly, Ewelina's artistic ability, though always fantastic, had grown astronomically since we started and I began to feel she had actually found her style for The Lowlife and as such, I felt again, that a reboot would help keep everything consistent, both in the art and the storytelling.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Process Shots.</strong></p>
<div>The last reason I will list is that my personal storytelling in the medium of comics has improved right along with Ewelina's art. My ability to edit and plot a comic story, though far from perfect, has gotten much better and more concise.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If you are wondering if you will still see some of your favorite supporting characters, well, the answer is that you most likely will. It may be later in the series, or a totally different type of role as we have decided to keep the story focused on the original direction, but they will be there. </div>

<h3>Why Digital Only?</h3>
</div><div>
<p>I would love nothing more than to bring physical copies of this book to the masses. However, my goal is to initially raise the funds to pay the artist, (Ewelina Mroczkowska,) to do the work. She does love working on Lowlife, but for her to be able to take the time needed to do a full comic, she has to prioritize it at the top of her list. As she is a full time artist, in order for her to do that, she has to get paid for her work. This is why we start with digital and IF we crush the initial goal, who knows, there may be some printed copies in everyone's future!</p>
<p>So help us get there! Spread the word, tell your friends, family and heck, even folks you meet on the street! </p>

""The world we be knowin' now were no' always thus.
Oh nah-na, it was once green 'n golden. Rich 'n pretty it was. The majik n' the techno-junk worked arm 'n arm. The collared, point-eared elves ain't have no collars back then I tell ya. All of 'em was free as the carrion muckers as pick bones in the sands t'day! In fact, if tale be true, weren't none o' the races as wore slaver's collars. Not elves, orks, men, nor fae. Was s'posed t' be a paradise.
Paradise? Sounds a little borin'  though ifin ya askin' me...""

Page 2 from ""The Lowlife.""
""...Anyways, tales say somethin' happened, though it ain't to clear as ta what. Somethin' big as to set this world to the flame. Took all o' that as had color, n' turnt it to grey. Burned it till there weren't much left but the bones. N' us that be left, we 'r just suckin' out the marrow.
Mayhap it was the men as fired too many shots inta the Fae Folk's magik apples that started the world burnin'. Or, mayhap it was the Fae Folk as dropped a conjured ball o' flame inta Man's ammo dump. Even coulda been one o' the suns got too close n' wiped the place clean. Ain't no real writin's or teachin's fer the how. Jus' rumors n' whispers really. N' them that tell always be addin' they own spin on it.""

Page 3 from ""The Lowlife.""
""None o' that as  past matter much now though. In fact, the Now, is about all that most even' can be worried 'bout ifin ya get my meanin'. Cause, Now, well, that ain't pretty...
Now is all warlords n' wanderers. Now is all dregs bein' drug. Now is all findin' n' keepin'! Takin' n' bein' tooken'! Wild majik, broken tech, starvation, slaver's collars, monsters both untamed n' unnamed in the wasted lands...""

Why a Reboot?
There are many reasons I decided to reboot this story. If I gave them all at once, this simple explanation would possibly become a full novel, so I will give you a few of the reasons at the forefront.
First, somewhere along the way in the originals, I lost sight of what I wanted to do with the main characters. Those characters being Ra'ek (The Lowlife) and Nis'si. Though they were the backbone of the story, I was spending more time developing supporting characters just to move the pair's plot line along. As I worked on the script for the third issue, I began to realize that I was creating even MORE characters to move the story forward, I decided it was time to take a step back and reconsider the direction I was going as my main characters had no personalities of their own.
Secondly, Ewelina's artistic ability, though always fantastic, had grown astronomically since we started and I began to feel she had actually found her style for The Lowlife and as such, I felt again, that a reboot would help keep everything consistent, both in the art and the storytelling.

Process Shots.
The last reason I will list is that my personal storytelling in the medium of comics has improved right along with Ewelina's art. My ability to edit and plot a comic story, though far from perfect, has gotten much better and more concise.
 
If you are wondering if you will still see some of your favorite supporting characters, well, the answer is that you most likely will. It may be later in the series, or a totally different type of role as we have decided to keep the story focused on the original direction, but they will be there. 
 
The Lowlife is for MATURE Readers as it contains violence, nudity, language and sexual content.
 

Design of the character the ""bad guys"" call MaMa.

<p>Alterna turns 13 this year, so it's only fitting that we've hit a growth spurt.</p>
<p>In 2016, Alterna turned ten years old and it was a good year.  2017 saw the debut of our $1.50 newsprint single issue line and quickly became our biggest year ever.  2018 came along and smashed 2017 to bits.</p>
<p><strong>Now 2019 is on pace to become our best year ever.</strong></p>
<p>All thanks to our wonderful readers and the supportive retailers that have helped us to bring back newsprint and affordable comics in a big way!</p>
<p>We have almost 30 titles in our newsprint line and almost 100 issues. Many of our comics have gone back to print two or three times as we're trying to keep all issues in stock as much as we can. As a result of all of this growth, our humble storage space is ""shrinking"" and we need to move to a bigger and better space.</p>

<h3>We've Got Some BIG Things Planned!</h3>
<p>Increasing the size of our storage space will allow us to do a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Larger initial print runs.</strong> We can't sell what we don't have, but with a bigger storage space, we'll be able to keep more issues in stock.</li>
<li>
<strong>Order shipping supplies in bulk.</strong> This will allow us to save money in the long run.</li>
<li>
<strong>Upgrading to a state of the art facility.</strong> The new facility will also have an indoor loading dock and we'll be able to receive shipments in any kind of weather. </li>
<li>
<strong>Hire Part-Time help.</strong> With more room to work, the right set-up, and better organization, we'll be able to hire part-timers to help receive shipments, sort and pack orders, and more as we continue to grow.</li>
<li>
<strong>Allow us to take the necessary steps to eventually launch</strong> <strong>Alterna Distribution.</strong> We've had this planned for a few years now! The first part of the process would be to get a bigger storage space so we can warehouse issues and eventually sell and distribute to readers and retailers.</li>

<h3>Here's How You Can Help!</h3>
<p><strong>We've got 6 perk levels for readers and 1 perk level strictly for comic shop retailers that want to have our books in hand for Free Comic Book Day (May 4th).</strong> </p>
<p>For AlternaWeen, people loved being able to donate our comics to kids for Halloween and many readers also donated comics to schools, children's hospitals, the troops, comic shops, libraries, and more. So we'd like to continue this tradition for FCBD. Each box is a random assortment of comics and will come with multiple copies of each issue so that you can donate any extras.</p>
<p><b>Comic shop retailers, </b>if you'd like to have our comics in time for this year's Free Comic Book Day, we have one specialized perk level for you which features 50 of our all ages comics at a deep discount. If you select this perk level, we <strong>guarantee</strong> that you'll receive the comics in time for the event.</p>
<p>By contributing to this campaign, you'll also help us to speed up the transition from one storage center to the other. The less we have to bring over, the better! </p>
