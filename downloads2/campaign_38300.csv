<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>San Pedro La Laguna is a beautiful town on Lake Atitlan in Guatemala however there are many areas in town and also by the lake that are covered with rubbish.</p>
<p>We need funds to set up a good waste management system to keep the town clean and tidy.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need funds for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Having rubbish picked up and taken to disposal facilities</li>
<li>Purchasing and installing rubbish bins</li>
<li>Employing people to clean rubbish</li>
<li>Designing and printing flyers</li>
<li>Educating children and people on environmental issues</li>
<li>Potential equipment for removing rubbish from the lake itself</li>
<li>General cleaning equipment</li>
<li>Rewarding the community for helping to pick up the rubbish</li>
</ul>
<p>You will get public recognition on our website for helping us to help the environment and if you ever visit San Pedro (or already live here) you will enjoy the benefits of a cleaner lake, cleaner streets and cleaner nature.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Currently the waste management in San Pedro is not capable of keeping the streets, lake and area properly clean. The local people bathe daily in the lake amongst the rubbish. We felt something needed to be done. We would like to set up a system where locals can be paid an above average wage to help keep their town clean. We will also utilise volunteer tourists and local children.</p>
<p>Keeping the town clean will not only be a beautiful experience for the locals and tourists but also for the plants and wildlife that live here.</p>

<p>Gordon Fuller is raising funds for SiKanda's project to build Eco-Houses for the people who who live and work on the landfill rubbish dump at Oaxaca, Mexico.  He intends to complete a  cross-country ski marathon (42 km), in the Engadin Valley, Switzerland, on March 10<sup>th</sup>having never taken part in any long distance event.  Each house costs GBP 4000, which means that he has to raise GBP 95 / Euro 120 per kilometre in the marathon to pay for just one house.</p>
<p>SiKanda is a non-profit organisation that has been working with at-risk communities in Oaxaca since 2008.  It works to improve the lives of the Pepenadores who live and work at the landfill site. The Pepenadores (informal trash pickers) live in shacks with no sanitation and work 10 hours daily, 7 days a week, earning approximately 40 pesos a day (GBP 2).  SiKanda provides employment and works to improve the lives of the Pepenadores and the city's slum dwellers by:</p>
<ol start=""1"">
<li>Assisting the Pepenadores to build high quality, durable eco-homes that have been designed to make use of conventional and recycled materials.</li>
<li>Improving the health and education of the Pepenadores by providing suitable protective equipment and teaching them basic hygiene.</li>
<li>Collecting rubbish that would be burned or dumped on the streets of the slums and compost the organic material.  The compost is sold or used for growing vegetables. (SiKanda's 2012 Worm Power project)</li>
<li>Creating awareness in society about the harsh conditions and the extreme poverty of families living in slums and working as informal rubbish pickers.</li>
</ol><p> </p>
<p><strong>The Project </strong>“Eco-houses for Hope”</p>
<p>SiKanda has built seven houses between 2009 and 2012 and aims to build a further five this year. </p>
<p>SiKanda volunteers will work with each Pepenador family to build a new, decent home in just seven days. The project creates a bond between those families who live at the dump and the people of the city who help them to clear the land and build the houses.</p>
<p>Each house uses approximately 5000 recycled plastic bottles and 4000 TetraPak milk/juice cartons together with conventional timber, cement and roofing materials to a design that guarantees durability and security. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The impact of this project</strong></p>
<p>A family of six will benefit from each house.</p>
<p>5000 recycled plastic bottles and 4000 TetraPak cartons will be used for the construction of each house.</p>
<p>Over 50 volunteers from local schools and institutions will participate in the construction together with 60 Pepenadores.</p>
<p>For each house built, a family will save GBP 25 every month thanks to the Eco-House (1/3 of their income is used to cover health and housing expenses).</p>
<p>The Pepenador community as a whole will benefit from better sanitation, health and reduced housing repair costs.</p>

This campaign is being run by the Toledo Institute for Development
and Environment (TIDE), a Belizean non-profit conservation and development NGO
(http://tidebelize.org).We recently launched a new conservation volunteer program
called Ridge to Reef Expeditions (http://www.fromridgetoreef.com/).
Ridge to Reef Expeditions will give international volunteers
conservation experience and enable TIDE to conserve one of the most pristine parts of Mesoamerica.We are about to launch our first ever expedition in July
2014. We have five international participants and we are seeking funding for a free place for a Belizean – Javier Alegria. 

Javier Alegria, pictured here with his nephew, wants the
opportunity to protect biodiversity in his native Toledo for future
generations.

Javier will also write you a letter describing his personal journey.If we don't reach our entire goal, we will still take Javier on expedition - just for less than the full eight weeks.On a Ridge to Reef Expedition, Javier will learn to SCUBA dive and monitor coral reef health among many other skills.Reasons to support Javier·      He was the most passionate and promising candidate in a competitive application·      It is his dream to protect the amazing Toledo District and Belize Barrier Reef·      On a Ridge to Reef Expedition, he will meet like-minded international volunteers and take action to protect endangered turtles, manatees, jaguars, yellow-headed parrots, monkeys, corals, and more·      He plans to stay in Toledo for the long term 
Training locals
in conservation makes sense because they are here for the long term. Here, TIDE community researcher Fernando relocates a hawksbill turtle nest that would have been lost to beach erosion.On this summer's expedition, Javier and the other volunteers will participate in the first ever manatee survey of its kind in southern Belize.Reasons to support

<p><b>FLOOR</b>: Any frame hexagon can hang a floor called the ""Iris"", which is a hexagonal joist that provides a floor with a central porthole. This porthole can be dilated to any diameter. </p>
<p>This floor is connected to the frame with carabiners, so the floor can be 'unclipped' and raised or lowered to any level.</p>
<p>The Joints of the prototype frames are then connected by carabiners, I-bolts and rope. (In proceeding models, stainless steel cable will be used)</p>
<p>This geometric design seems to be incredibly strong(and has held 15+ people for ~1 hour), but its' minimum breaking force remains <i>unknown</i>.</p>

<p><b>-To load test a 1 level MBH using barrels of water.</b></p>
<p><b>-Make a 2 person, ""Glamping"" model available for purchase.</b></p>
<p><b><b>-To make the frame of the FLT (Fully Livable Treehouse) strong enough to carry more people than it can fit, shock loaded to a factor of 10.  </b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>-To complete the first fully livable prototype</b></p>
<p><b>-To beta test the first line of FLT's in order to research any unknown safety variables.</b></p>
<p><b>-ULTIMATE MISSION: To begin building treehouse villages and cities, incorporating our homes into the biosphere as a mitigation for climate crises... and because it's freakin' cool.</b></p>
<p><b>SIDING for glamping model?</b> In an initial glamping model, I would like to test a softshell of Gabion mesh(a high guage chicken wire used in rock retaining walls) and a system of macro and micro shingles, (both opaque and translucent) will be <i>tied</i> to the structure, like the breathable &amp; waterproof feathers of a duck. </p>
<p>For winterized models, I want to test a set of insulated <b>wings</b> that can fold down during cold weather, and open during warm weather, like an upside down lotus flower.</p>
<p>Just like the desktop computer, the Monkey Bubble House can be upgraded substantially. You can add many frames and floors together to make it bigger.</p>

<p>2) Milk Thistle- Rigging segmentation &amp; Speed of hoisting.</p>
<p>I remember when I was a kid, sitting in my mom's garden, I saw a Milk Thistle plant grow 2 feet tall in 2 days. I thought to myself ""why can't we build houses that quickly?""</p>
<p>The Milk thistle plant can grow larger very quickly because their leaves are pre-formed inside a sheathe, with individual segments that open up like a beach umbrella.</p>
<p>The Monkey Bubble House is not held together by 6 long cords, but rather, 72+ individual cords between each segment. This allows for greater safety (if one several cords break, the structure will always hold), and it allows the structure to open quickly and smoothly.</p>

""eee eee ooo ooo ahh ahh""-Can be made with everything from junkyard to space grade materials.-Uses multiple repeating iterations of very simple architecture, making it highly upgradable!-Theoretically self cleaning.-Theoretically affordable to build and efficient to heat.How it's made:The FLT-1(Fully Livable Treehouse 1) aka, ""Monkey Bubble House"" is made from 3 parts: The Body, The Web, and the Wings.FLT 1- ""Body, Web, Wings""Typical FLT 1 frame, in a grove of ~50 year old Home Trees. (Braeden standing below)
""Non-merchantible timber"" The Monkey Bubble House is made from 10 year old trees. Salvaged from burn piles on a Vancouver Island clearcut. Millions of these logs are burned every year.
The Body consists of a number of hexagon ""frames"" that crescendo and decrescendo in diameter according to PHI, 1.618 (aka the ""Golden Ratio"" found in biological geometry).
These hexagon frames are then transposed onto one another at the Fibonacci Spiral (137.5 degrees).

(Above) Hexagons crescendo in diameter according to the Golden Ratio, and (below) are Transposed onto each other at the Golden Ratio (drawn by eye, not to scale)

Floors can be added at every 2nd frame hexagon.
FLOOR: Any frame hexagon can hang a floor called the ""Iris"", which is a hexagonal joist that provides a floor with a central porthole. This porthole can be dilated to any diameter. 
This floor is connected to the frame with carabiners, so the floor can be 'unclipped' and raised or lowered to any level.
The Joints of the prototype frames are then connected by carabiners, I-bolts and rope. (In proceeding models, stainless steel cable will be used)
This geometric design seems to be incredibly strong(and has held 15+ people for ~1 hour), but its' minimum breaking force remains unknown.
 
-MISSIONS:
-To load test a 1 level MBH using barrels of water.
-Make a 2 person, ""Glamping"" model available for purchase.
-To make the frame of the FLT (Fully Livable Treehouse) strong enough to carry more people than it can fit, shock loaded to a factor of 10.  
-To complete the first fully livable prototype
-To beta test the first line of FLT's in order to research any unknown safety variables.
-ULTIMATE MISSION: To begin building treehouse villages and cities, incorporating our homes into the biosphere as a mitigation for climate crises... and because it's freakin' cool.
SIDING for glamping model? In an initial glamping model, I would like to test a softshell of Gabion mesh(a high guage chicken wire used in rock retaining walls) and a system of macro and micro shingles, (both opaque and translucent) will be tied to the structure, like the breathable & waterproof feathers of a duck. 
For winterized models, I want to test a set of insulated wings that can fold down during cold weather, and open during warm weather, like an upside down lotus flower.
Just like the desktop computer, the Monkey Bubble House can be upgraded substantially. You can add many frames and floors together to make it bigger.

4 storey Monkey Bubble House. (It's actually 2 Monkey Bubble Houses merged together)

Top view of the Monkey Bubble House, Showing the Fibonacci spiral.
The FLT 1, aka ""Monkey Bubble House"", is made by borrowing 12 concepts from nature, also known as Biomimicry Architecture:
1)Alder Leaf- 120/60/120 degree Floor design
I asked, ""How can I create a floor that is simple, using multiple repeating iterations and cleans itself.""

Red Alder leaves
 I examined the leaves of the red alder tree, and discovered that most of the veins intersect the central stem at 120 degree angles, which are the angles found in a hexagon. These leaves also have a ridge that prevents them from collecting dust and water.

Alder leaf floor design: 3 parallelograms all made with 1 length of log, intersecting at identical angles.

""IRIS"" floor frame

Alder leaf, half-moon floor allows dirt to roll down the sides. In order to clean your floor, you just have to jump!
2) Milk Thistle- Rigging segmentation & Speed of hoisting.
I remember when I was a kid, sitting in my mom's garden, I saw a Milk Thistle plant grow 2 feet tall in 2 days. I thought to myself ""why can't we build houses that quickly?""
The Milk thistle plant can grow larger very quickly because their leaves are pre-formed inside a sheathe, with individual segments that open up like a beach umbrella.
The Monkey Bubble House is not held together by 6 long cords, but rather, 72+ individual cords between each segment. This allows for greater safety (if one several cords break, the structure will always hold), and it allows the structure to open quickly and smoothly.

Milk Thistle simply ""Opens up""

""Pre-formed Monkey Bubble House simply opens up""
3) Honey Bee- The Hexagon is a shape that can be tessellated and presents the highest volume-circumference ratio. In Other words, the largest rooms, with the least amount of building materials. Hexagons allow for the largest number of cells, with the greatest area per cell, with the least amount of building materials. This allows the honey bees to make large nests every year, mortgage free.4) Orb Weaver Spider- THE WEB (fractal weight diffusion system)""How can we create tree houses that don't hurt the trees?""A spider web will never hurt the grass or vegetation it connects to. The Orb Weaver spider diffuses the weight of its' web over a wide area for maximum strength and safety. Individual strands of silk will often fan out at the ends when connecting to their environment. So I designed a ""collar"" system that spreads the weight evenly over a wide area, using large loops, so the tree can never outgrow its' collar.  Orb weaver will never hurt the vegetation it connects to.""Hexa-fractal"" collars diffuse the weight to less than 1.15lbs per square inch, which is lighter than the weight of a birds nest resting on the home tree. Hexa-fractal weight diffusion design. From the top comes six larger cables, which fractal into 36 smaller tree collars. 5) Lotus Flower- insulated Wings designed to pull in like a marionette during cold weather. Fresh water lotus.My geometric interpretation of a Lotus flower. Lotus ""Wings"" open when warm, close when cold. Sketches of the layers. (Left, right and top: Frame, shingles, wings, folded in)""Wings"" pull down like a marionette in cold weather. 6) Sunflower- Fibonacci spiral  Fibonacci spiral seen in the sunflower.Fibonacci spiral shown in collapsed Monkey Bubble frame. 7) Fig-Bottom symmetrical entry. What is the best way to enter a fig shaped structure? Ask the fig wasp! The Fig wasp enters the fig from the bottom. This allows it to pollinate the fig without getting squished between leaves and branches during windy weather
Bottom porthole allows for entry & exit while the structure is rotating & rocking in the wind.
8 )Duck Feathers - Micro & Macro shingle design.
Duck feathers are waterproof, insulated, self cleaning, breathable, and extremely light. Each feather is shaped like an elongated oval.
I asked ""how can I make a shingle system that is 100% portable and breathable?"" 

Portable shingles tied to mesh using sin wave pattern. Will use gabion mesh in future models for greater strength & safety. Hexagonal shingles positioned with the corner pointed down are 100% waterproof, while using 17.5% less material, allowing the structure to be lighter.

In photos I am using square shingles, whereas in future models, I will use hexagonal shaped shingles. I can also use a mosaic of clear, translucent and opaque materials.

Reflective ceiling could allow for the structure to be lit with a single candle, if held above eye level.

Reflective interior can be made from junkyard materials.
10) Mammalian Iris- Contracted & dilated floor frame design.
Can contract and dilate like the eye of a mammal.
""Iris"" floor design, all made from 1 length of log.11) Natural environment of Primates- Jungle GymPrimates often spend a % of their day hanging from their hands in the branches of trees, which decompresses their lower spine. Studies have shown that 85% of adult homo sapiens experience lower back problems at some point in their life. . . but the Monkey Bubble House mimics the natural environment of primates! ""Anecdotal evidence suggests the Monkey Bubble Houses attract young homo sapiens, in search of their natural environment.""12) Stem cells- Transform-ability of frame components. Many parts of the FLT-1 can be switched into another area, and multiple Monkey Bubble Houses can combine to make bigger ones.Economics-FLT's (Fully Livable Treehouses) are free of concrete foundations, making them potentially more economical than ground houses.-Can be built without clearing land.
20th century ground houses promote drought & deserts.
-Circular structures facilitate heat convection, making them faster & more economical to heat.
-Hexagons and spheres allow the largest rooms, with the least amount of building materials. (due to the mathematical laws of Isoperimetric inequality).
-The desire for minimum weight burden on the tree encourages an efficiency of building materials. 
-Monkey Bubble Houses can be built from simple, multiple repeating iterations of the simple architecture.
-Can be built from junkyard materials to space-grade materials(like unfabricated titanium piping).
Environment
-FLT's are built into the biosphere, promoting a healthy climate.

Live Tree Rentals? A source of revenue from Ancient trees without logging them.
 -Puts economic value on living Oldgrowth Forests
-The Monkey Bubble House is built with weight diffusion collars, allowing it to not hurt the Home Trees.-Suspended structures free land for animals and permiculture.-Homo Sapiens can enter into a symbiotic relationship with their home tree by providing human music, water, nitrogen(from their urine) and pruning.Human Health/Hygiene-The Monkey Bubble House is built like a jungle gym with multiple levels to climb around, making it an ideal fitness party for homo-sapiens!
 A hammock in a Monkey Bubble House functions like a gyroscope.

-Convection of a circular structure inhibits mold, making a healthy breathing environment!
-Playing music for Home Trees can encourage their growth. (4)
-In 2007 & 2013, it was scientifically proven that being in the very presence of ancient trees and forests can lower a persons blood pressure, and increases the immune system.(2)(3)
-Hygiene: half-moon floor structure is self cleaning because dirt rolls through the halfmoons; you can clean your Monkey Bubble House by jumping.
Portability/Upgradability
-The FLT-1 is 100% portable!

A 4 story FLT-1 frame in the back of my firewood truck. (Yes, this is literally a 4 story Monkey Bubble frame stacked in my truck)
-Can fit a FLT-1 frame in the back of a small truck.
-Very fast to assemble & take down.
-The FLT-1 is highly up-gradable, adding more frame hexagons, going from a fig shape, to a pineapple, to a banana.
-Move the floors up and down as you like. Sketch of a ""typical"" FLT-1 frame. 




Some skteches of a miniature version. (Above)

Miniature prototype, with 25 year old humans, in 25 year old Home Trees!


Safety:
SO far, the FLT 1 has a perfect safety record and has held up to 15 humans at once. Safety is the first priority moving forward.


Prototypes will be load tested and any weaknesses will be researched. 

I would like to test 120 degree steel timberframe joints and a variety of clamped joints and supports.
Future models may use stainless steel cables, and high grade carabiners and rigging components.
Titanium, aluminum & steel pipes may be used..

In future research, I would like to experiment with lashing the structure together, (above) mimicking the tendons and ligaments of biological joints.
-The Hexagonal compression dynamics suggest a high strength to weight ratio.
-The Fibonacci spiral, allows no joint to ever align with another joint, making them stacked like bricks.
-Uniform weight distribution: The floor joist hangs from the supporting hexagonal frame by carabiners so wherever you step, your weight is distributed evenly around the structure.
GOALS & COSTS:
DID YOU KNOW? This project has come to life exclusively through the sales of firewood.
For safety reasons, all future FLT's will use the highest grade components (carabiners, shackles etc.) available.
Typical requirements of a 2-3 storey Monkey Bubble House frame (Not including labour, logs, tools, fuel and arbourist work):

36 small harness collars    
72 high grade carabiners  
6 big harness cables        
6 small Weldless Steel rings 
3 big Weldless Steel rings 
1 Swivel crane Hook (rated for 11 tons)          
3 big anchor shackles        
108 medium-small shackles    
108 forged I-bolts      
36 stainless steel cables of 'x' length
36 stainless steel cables of 'y' length
500 Man Hours

$4000 would help: 
Load test a 1 level frame using barrels of water.
This will require xyz# of water barrels, a 1000 gallon water tank (I can put on my firewood truck and park at a higher level), a hose, 6 sturdy home trees outside the city, (possible) cherry picker rental, assembly labour, fuel, arbourist work, and misc.
Once it is load tested, it can become available for purchase in BC.
$10 000 would help:
-complete the first ""glamping"" (glamour camping) prototype with steel cables, high grade components, and siding.
$60 000 would help:
-Complete the first FULLY LIVABLE TREEHOUSE, with plumbing & electrical, and all the comforts of a ground house.

<p>地球全体を見たときそのほとんどは海水で、飲み水として使える淡水はおよそ３％ほど、北極・南極の水や氷を除けば約１％にしかなりません。<br/>しかしその一方で、水資源を巡る問題は沢山の課題があり、汚染問題や干ばつ、水位上昇、そして水の取水量の問題などが挙げられるでしょう。特にカルフォルニアを含めたアメリカ西海岸は干ばつの問題が深刻で、昨年はフロリダ州で牡蛎産業の漁業災害が宣言されました。これはジョージア州での淡水の水消費が原因だと言われ、水だけではなく水産や農業と言った私たちの生活を脅かすレベルまで達していることを知ると、もう人ごとでは居られません。<br/>特に農業用水は、人間が使える水の中の７０％を占めていると言われています。<br/>もちろん、作物を育てて収穫することは生きる上で大事なことですが、それでもこの７０％という数字は莫大なものです。<br/>そこで私たちは、この７０％の水源は本当に作物にとって適切に使われているのだろうか、無駄はないのだろうか、という点に着目しました。今土壌がどれだけ乾燥していて、作物がどのくらい水を欲しているのか、もっと現代のテクノロジーで効率よくデータ化でき、ひと目みてわかる、そんなデバイスがあればこの水問題は少しでも解決するのではないだろうか。わたしたちはこの壮大な課題を、テクノロジーとものづくりの力で解決しようと思い、SenSproutを生み出しました。<br/><br/></p>
<p>SenSprout はインクジェット印刷技術を用いることで実現可能になった、土壌モニタリングのセンサネットワークのコンセプトアプリケーションです。静電容量の変化を検知できるセンサにより、土の中の水分量を測ることができるほか，葉濡れセンサで降雨も検知することが可能です。印刷技術を用いているため、小ロットでも大量生産でも低コストで製作できるという特徴があります。メンテナンスコストも最小限に抑えられるほか、大規模農業や高付加価値作物の灌漑の最適化、いつ起きるかわからない地すべりやがけ崩れリスクの評価といった応用が期待できます。 </p>

<p>使い方はSenSproutの作成キットを組み立て、水分量をモニタリングしたい土に差すだけ。難しい設置やバッテリーなどは不要です。</p>
<p>土と葉の水分量を別々に計測することができ、SenSprout上のLEDライトが水分量に応じて色を変えるので、一目見て水やりが必要かどうかが判ります。<span>つまり今まで勘頼みだった水やりが、SenSproutのモニタリングから得られた情報に基づいて実施することにより水資源の大幅な節約に繋がり、水のやりすぎで植物を枯らせてしまうことも少なくなるでしょう。<span>将来的にはLEDライトだけではなく、水分データをPCやスマートフォンなどでデジタル化させることも目標としています。<br/>
SenSproutは大きな畑は勿論、家庭菜園やプランター栽培など幅広く使って頂くことが可能です。</span></span></p>

SenSprout is simple as it can be.
Build the SenSprout using the craft kit and put the SenSprout into the soil where you wish to monitor the level of moisture.  The moisture level of soil and
leaves can be seen separately, and the LED light on the SenSprout will change colors as the level of
moisture changes. This allows you to decide whether you need to add more water which leads to save
water and also to save the plant from wilting.

			In the near future we aim to send moist level data not only to the LED light but also to PC and
smartphones.

SenSprout could be used for large scale fields to small scale such as personal kitchen garden.


Depending on the water level, the LED light color changes to red, blue and green.(LED design and the sign color may be changed from the above image.)

地球全体を見たときそのほとんどは海水で、飲み水として使える淡水はおよそ３％ほど、北極・南極の水や氷を除けば約１％にしかなりません。しかしその一方で、水資源を巡る問題は沢山の課題があり、汚染問題や干ばつ、水位上昇、そして水の取水量の問題などが挙げられるでしょう。特にカルフォルニアを含めたアメリカ西海岸は干ばつの問題が深刻で、昨年はフロリダ州で牡蛎産業の漁業災害が宣言されました。これはジョージア州での淡水の水消費が原因だと言われ、水だけではなく水産や農業と言った私たちの生活を脅かすレベルまで達していることを知ると、もう人ごとでは居られません。特に農業用水は、人間が使える水の中の７０％を占めていると言われています。もちろん、作物を育てて収穫することは生きる上で大事なことですが、それでもこの７０％という数字は莫大なものです。そこで私たちは、この７０％の水源は本当に作物にとって適切に使われているのだろうか、無駄はないのだろうか、という点に着目しました。今土壌がどれだけ乾燥していて、作物がどのくらい水を欲しているのか、もっと現代のテクノロジーで効率よくデータ化でき、ひと目みてわかる、そんなデバイスがあればこの水問題は少しでも解決するのではないだろうか。わたしたちはこの壮大な課題を、テクノロジーとものづくりの力で解決しようと思い、SenSproutを生み出しました。
SenSprout はインクジェット印刷技術を用いることで実現可能になった、土壌モニタリングのセンサネットワークのコンセプトアプリケーションです。静電容量の変化を検知できるセンサにより、土の中の水分量を測ることができるほか，葉濡れセンサで降雨も検知することが可能です。印刷技術を用いているため、小ロットでも大量生産でも低コストで製作できるという特徴があります。メンテナンスコストも最小限に抑えられるほか、大規模農業や高付加価値作物の灌漑の最適化、いつ起きるかわからない地すべりやがけ崩れリスクの評価といった応用が期待できます。 


使い方はSenSproutの作成キットを組み立て、水分量をモニタリングしたい土に差すだけ。難しい設置やバッテリーなどは不要です。
土と葉の水分量を別々に計測することができ、SenSprout上のLEDライトが水分量に応じて色を変えるので、一目見て水やりが必要かどうかが判ります。つまり今まで勘頼みだった水やりが、SenSproutのモニタリングから得られた情報に基づいて実施することにより水資源の大幅な節約に繋がり、水のやりすぎで植物を枯らせてしまうことも少なくなるでしょう。将来的にはLEDライトだけではなく、水分データをPCやスマートフォンなどでデジタル化させることも目標としています。
SenSproutは大きな畑は勿論、家庭菜園やプランター栽培など幅広く使って頂くことが可能です。




土の水分の量に応じて、LEDライトが赤、青、緑に光ります。（色は変更される場合があります。）




▲SenSproutの構造予想（リターンでご用意させて頂いているDIYキットのものとは特徴が異なります）







私たちは今までSenSproutを世に出すため、2年以上の月日を掛けて研究に力を注いで来ました。しかし、いくつかの助成金を頂きながら研究や運営をしながらもまだ改良のための資金が足りていません。
SenSproutをもっと手に取りやすく、もっと世界中の水資源を守るために使える最新のテクノロジーになって欲しい。世界中の人が、SenSproutによってもっと水資源の基調さを意識してもらいたい。そんな想いで、私たちはこの壮大な問題を解決するため、今でも研究を続けています。そして今回が、Indiegogoで一般の方へ実際に手に取って頂く機会を設けることが出来ました。私たちにとって、このクラウドファンディングは世界中の人からSenSproutに注目して頂くとても貴重な経験だと思っています。少しでもこのプロジェクトに賛同して下さった方、SenSproutを使ってみたい方は是非ともご支援のご協力をお願い致します。また、支援は難しい場合でもこのプロジェクトを皆様のFacebookやTwitterなどでシェアして頂くだけでも、私たちにとって大きな力になります、どうぞ宜しくお願い致します！

<p><strong>Remediation of arsenic contaminated water</strong></p>
<p>Chemists Without Borders started a project in 2014 to educate high school students in Bangladesh about the health hazards of arsenic in drinking water.  In the process we found two schools, Sitakunda High School and Teriail High School whose school water was heavily contaminated with arsenic.</p>
<p>This past year, with the engineering help of the local Department of Public Health Engineering (DPHE) and funding from Rotary Club Khulshi in Bangladesh and  the Shallotte Rotary Club in North Carolina, we were able to replace both of the contaminated wells, and now about 4000 students at those schools are drinking water that is free of arsenic.</p>
<p>The DPHE engineer explained as follows:</p>
<p>The contaminated wells were tube wells drawing water from the deeper aquifers that were contaminated with arsenic.  The ring wells that we constructed draw water from the aquifer nearest the surface which is not contaminated with arsenic.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Ring Well Under Construction</strong></p>
<p>So the solution to obtaining water free of arsenic was just to construct this shallow ring well.</p>
<p><strong>What we’ll do in 2017</strong></p>
<p>1. Contact 38 high schools and colleges in Sitakunda Upazila, discuss our project and test the  school water for arsenic</p>
<p>2. Construct up to ten ring wells to replace any tube wells that are contaminated with arsenic</p>
<p>3. Provide arsenic-free water for all the students and teachers at these schools.</p>

<p>5. Investigate other remediation options, such as community filters, in locations where ring wells are not possible.</p>
<p>6. Make our operating model in Sitakunda Upazila a template that can be replicated in other regions of Bangladesh.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>The response to the course was very positive.  Students had not had a course before covering these topics, and the format was also appreciated very much.  The class was very interactive, with students asking and being asked questions, and participating in an exercise in every class.

at a glance</b><br/></p><p></p>
<p>In a tiny Greek island, Old Trikeri, in the Pagasetic (Pagasitikos)
gulf, Pelion area, central Greece,
I own an old traditional house. The building was build in 1927 and lies within
an area of 1000m<sup>2</sup> with olive trees, 50 mt distant from the sea.
Actually it is abandoned almost forty years.</p>
<p>I would love to bring further and complete renewal of the house in order
to use it as a hosting structure for people that love to stay in a really
natural environment where vacation from everyday living makes sense! </p>

The house will, in a further step, be part of a larger project that
intends to exploit the naturalistic, historical and cultural characteristics of
the island in an eco-sensitive approach.<p></p>

<p>Old Trikeri island is a small, 4,5 square kilometres,
island within the entrance of the Pagasetic (Pagasitikos) gulf, Mount Pelion
area, central Greece.
It is not fulsome to say it is a small forgotten paradise. Over 75 thousand
olive trees, no cars at all, walking pathways, a clear sea, few and gentle
inhabitants, 56 according the last census of 2011, two taverns an a
-literally!- mini market, make it a little dream but still easy and worthwhile
to reach. Old Trikeri is documented to be inhabited since the pre-historical
times with the name of Kikýnethos (Greek Κικύνηθος). Swimming, fishing, snorkelling, walking, relaxing and dreaming are
some of the things that you can do and that acquire a new meaning here, believe
me. To have more information about Old Trikeri please visit the site

traditional House Restoration in Old Trikeri Island, Pelion,
 Greece
 The Project
at a glance
In a tiny Greek island, Old Trikeri, in the Pagasetic (Pagasitikos)
gulf, Pelion area, central Greece,
I own an old traditional house. The building was build in 1927 and lies within
an area of 1000m2 with olive trees, 50 mt distant from the sea.
Actually it is abandoned almost forty years.
I would love to bring further and complete renewal of the house in order
to use it as a hosting structure for people that love to stay in a really
natural environment where vacation from everyday living makes sense! 

The house will, in a further step, be part of a larger project that
intends to exploit the naturalistic, historical and cultural characteristics of
the island in an eco-sensitive approach.
     The Aim

Repair and, renovate  a one
hundred year old traditional stone house* with a total respect of its typical
features in a remote place requires a significant effort. I’m asking your
support and participation to complete this step of the project.
My aim is to reach the €70.000,00 necessary to complete works.

Paving, grouting, roof repair, wooden floor replacement, plumbing,
fixtures, surrounding wall, garden, etc, will ask about three to four month’s
work. Please have a look on the site www.kikynethos.com to see what
it is about.  *house has been recognized as a local traditional
building by the Architectural Committee. 
*house has been recognized as a local traditional
building by the Architectural Committee. 
Once
finished…
…the house (used to be called
“kalývi”=cottage by the locals), having a total surface of approx. 110m2, will be able to
host four people in two bedrooms in the upper floor and, occasionally, two more
people in the large living room in the basement. Two bathrooms and a large
kitchen will complete the building. The surrounding garden, approx. 900 m2, has 12 old olive
trees and will offer peaceful hours under the Greek sun or under the olive
trees, while the sweet whispering of the nearby bay will sing for you.No traffic, no crowd, no pollution at all. Pheasants are the most
probable “disturbers” just in case they will come out of the bush.The Place
Old Trikeri island is a small, 4,5 square kilometres,
island within the entrance of the Pagasetic (Pagasitikos) gulf, Mount Pelion
area, central Greece.
It is not fulsome to say it is a small forgotten paradise. Over 75 thousand
olive trees, no cars at all, walking pathways, a clear sea, few and gentle
inhabitants, 56 according the last census of 2011, two taverns an a
-literally!- mini market, make it a little dream but still easy and worthwhile
to reach. Old Trikeri is documented to be inhabited since the pre-historical
times with the name of Kikýnethos (Greek Κικύνηθος). Swimming, fishing, snorkelling, walking, relaxing and dreaming are
some of the things that you can do and that acquire a new meaning here, believe
me. To have more information about Old Trikeri please visit the site
www.kikynethos.com.
      Your
Contribution

Asking for contribution in a project, means we have something to share:
a common goal, a common advantage, a common pleasure. I’m asking those of you
that feel the value of simple and beautiful things and like to contribute to
preserve and enjoy them to be part of this project.
You can make your donation and you will be recognized for it. By doing
that you also open a window out to a magical place helping it to be preserved
against time. You will also gain a chance to visit again and again that place
as a friend, as someone that contributed to create it. Being part of a valid
creation is a high quality pleasure! 
For the specific recognition we offer for your contribution, please see
the perks section and make your own choice. Perks include keeping memory of
your contribution, naming a tree, tasting the exquisite genuine olive oil of
Trikeri, spending a week time there, or spending time in an other little
paradise: a house in Filicudi Island, one of the Aeolian islands, north side of Sicily, Italy.
Aeolian islands are UNESCO World Heritage
site. Further information and details are given on
the Project's site specific section: www.kikynethos.com/#!reward-plan/c1m3l.
You feel you
can not contribute?

Hopefully, life is not only about money. You could help by spreading the
info about this project, talk to a friend, link our web site, or, if you think
you are able to work yourself, email me. I could host a limited number of
people there for a part of the repairing works stage.

Any amount collected with your contribution will anyway be used for the
projects purposes.

Can I buy your product today?

We currently have the only prototype in the world for this product. The goal of this campaign is to raise the funds necessary to bring this to a finished product, to have them manufactures (in the US, using American labor). 
Contributing to this campaign gives you two advantages

You are on a list of Beta testers and will be first contacted when our Beta Testing program starts.
For each dollar you contribute, you get credit for $2 towards the price of our finished units. 


Is this some new technology that is going to take years to “discover”?

No, this is existing technology, used in industry and retail markets for years. 
Our plan is to have this a finished manufactured device in a number of months, not years.

Why has this been overlooked by energy efficiency experts?

Typical engineering today views any energy used for its designed purpose unwasted once it is used for that purpose, regardless of what happens after that original purpose. 
Traditional and typical engineering is largely based on an old outdated model that says, “energy is cheap”, so if you are running out of hot water before the showers are done, buy a bigger hot water heater. 

The government is working on energy efficiency aren’t they?

Do you remember what the last product that was created through a government sponsored program to save you energy was?
The government, and many of the companies who receive government funding are very effective at using government funds to produce reports that make it very clear that more funding needs to go into developing energy efficiency. . . or reports. . . 

Is this product safe?
Yes. We are very conscience of safety in our homes, and with our product, in your home as well. We will not release the product until it is thoroughly tested and is accepted by current building standards and codes.

<h3>SPROG: A Training for Changemakers</h3>
<p>For more than 10 years, the Sierra Student Coalition’s Summer Training Program (SPROG) has been empowering youth leaders with the tools they need to <em>start</em> movements, <em>run</em> campaigns and<em>create</em> the world they want to live in:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are the Northwest Regional SPROG team.</li>
<li>For one week this summer, youth will come together from across the Pacific Northwest to learn, share, grow, and connect to become future leaders and organizers. </li>
<li>Participants learn how to:
<ul>
<li>work with the media, facilitate meetings, recruit members to their cause, meet with decision makers, promote anti-oppression, and much more through fun interactive trainings. They are able to apply all of these new skills in a simulation training at the end of the week.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">""At SPROG, I formed a community with passionate people, where I felt I could return to my other communities to create the change I wanted to see in the world, knowing that I had the support of fellow SPROG parcipants and the skills to make an impact."" -Terra Smith, NW SPROG 2010</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Your contribution will go towards providing travel and tuition scholarships so that all youth who are interested can attend SPROG, no matter their financial circumstances. With your donation you will be investing in the future leaders, decision-makers, organizers, and change-makers of tomorrow.</p>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Funding Details</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>We are raising $3,000 ($1,000 online and $2,000 through events and other means) to provide scholarships to participants to cover their tuition costs. The tuition covers lodging, food, and training materials, which is $350 per person.</li>
<li>All training is done completely by volunteers, the majority of which are previous SPROG participants.</li>
<li>We think that everyone should have an equal opportunity to come to SPROG and with your contribution we can ensure that the next visionary leader will not be turned away due to lack of funds.</li>

<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>

<li>SPROG provides an opportunity for youth to develop their leadership skills and gives them the tools to create positive change. These youth will become future leaders.</li>

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>""And the time came when the risk to remain tight in a bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossom."" -Anais Nin </p>
<p>Well, friends, that time has arrived!  I'm about to embark on what I find to be both incredibly exciting and scary at the same time - a volunteer adventure around the world!  I will visit a number of different places (spanning five continents) and participate in carefully-researched volunteer projects in each location.  My journey will likely include community, educational, and conservation efforts in England, Scotland, Canada, Australia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Kenya, and Tanzania.  I will be working with people from all over the world and living in various kinds of environments trying to learn as much as I can and sprinkle lots of goodness along the way!</p>
<p>This is important to me both as a tribute to my grandparents, who have all passed on at this point and who were each bold in their respective ways, and because I believe so strongly in our ability to use our passions, talents, and resources to help make the world a better place, even if the idea seems cliche or idealistic.  </p>
<p>This adventure has been a dream of mine for quite a while, and it's now time to chase it.  Your donations will help make this possible by helping me get from place to place, replant native vegetation, gather data on wildlife habitats and behavior, rehabilitate injured animals, and work with both children and adults to learn more English and math skills and gain greater confidence in their own abilities.  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What's Needed &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I have spent a long time researching this journey by reading through books, brochures, websites, and online discussions and reviews to try to make the best decisions I can and be as sure as possible that I've chosen organizations that are trustworthy and operate with integrity - running legitimate programs that work closely with the local population to help ensure local needs are being met and volunteer impact is both warranted and desired.  </p>
<p>I am funding most of this trip by myself, but I am hoping to raise $2250 with this campaign to help my participation in these projects.  There are a lot of expenses associated with a trip of this magnitude, and every little bit will help me achieve my goal.  Visas, tickets, insurance, airport fees and taxes, meals, accommodations, transportation, and program fees must all be budgeted and covered.  </p>
<p>This is a big endeavor.  I've never done anything like this before, and your help - no matter the amount - will be greatly appreciated!  You will be an integral part of this journey and will provide both tangible and intangible impacts around the world!  You can join with other people who are also contributing to this adventure and help me get from place to place and reach more locations.</p>
<p>You can share this journey with me in another way, too!  I plan to start a blog before leaving and maintain it throughout my trip, whenever possible, so that I can keep my family and friends updated on my volunteer projects along the way and you can read about the impact your donations are making.</p>
<p>Since all funds will help, even if I do not reach my goal, I will still be able to put your donations to good use.  And... In the best-case scenario of exceeding my goal :), extra funds could be used to participate in more projects or stay with currently-planned projects for longer periods of time.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>It is, honestly, hard to say what the impact of such an undertaking will be.  I suspect, and hope, it will be multi-faceted, but perhaps difficult to define empirically.  On some of the more research-oriented projects, data gathered while I'm there may help inform future habitat goals and policies, educational materials, the general scientific knowledge base, and at least in one case, the organization publishes the results of the study.  My understanding is that other impacts include reforestation of native flora species which will, in turn, provide greater habitat for native fauna, care for injured and orphaned animals as they prepare to return to a wilder, more natural habitat, and assistance for people wanting to learn new communication skills.  </p>
<p>My hope, of course, is that these impacts extend even further into the future... But I don't want to put too many expectations on specific outcomes, especially as I will likely never know about those impacts.  There are still so many unknowns, and some things simply cannot be measured.  What is the impact, for instance, of an impromptu soccer game after class or spending time with people and leaning more about them and their ideas? </p>
<p>I sincerely hope to make a positive difference throughout my trip, and I am certain that I, too, will change as a result of this journey - perhaps more so than the places and people I visit, so it's a big leap I'm about to take!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>You can help in so many ways: offering support, communication, and well-wishes are most definitely appreciated!  Also...</p>
<p>Give early and give often! :)</p>
<p>And feel free to spread the word.  If you know of other good people who might be legitimately interested in supporting this project, please let them know.  The more people who know, the better chance we'll have of making this happen!</p>

<h2>About the Solar Field in the Galápagos</h2>
Yosef Abramowitz, A.K.A. 'Captain Sunshine', who has been <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sh3x7PVy54Y"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""CNN Story on Yosef"">recognized by CNN</a> as one of six leading green pioneers on the planet and the Co-founder of Energiya Global, needs your help to build a 300KW solar power field on San Cristóbal Island in the Galápagos.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<img alt=""San Cristóbal Island"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://contest.thesca.org/sites/default/files/DSC_3678.JPG"" src="""" style=""margin-left: 80px; margin-right: 80px;"" title=""San Cristóbal Island""/>                                                                   <em>San Cristóbal Island</em>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Yosef is accustomed to building large solar fields with big investors, but the solar field in the Galápagos is too small a project for these investors, they see it as small potatoes. Yosef and Energiya Global hope that they will break even from the field only in 15 years, so they have committed to donating all the profits back into the Galápagos community.<span class=""text"" style=""color: white;"">Charles Darwin Research Station</span>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Worried about the impact a solar field will have on the environment there? So is Captain Sunshine, that is why we are building the field on an old garbage dump.</div>
<div><img alt=""Future Site of the Solar Field"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-h8ZR1U0Ka6E/UPLgMEtcIII/AAAAAAAAABs/bey5VDm4ixo/s640/garbageIMG_1222.JPG"" src="""" style=""margin-left: 80px; margin-right: 80px;"" title=""Future Site of the Solar Field""/></div>
<div>                       <em>Existing garbage dump soon to be replaced with our solar field</em>
</div>
<div>
<h2>Where We Are Today</h2>
<p><strong>We have completed almost all of the pre-development stages including:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1.5 hectares of land in San Cristobal secured via a 15 years land lease with the municipality.</li>
<li>A Certificate of Intersection was obtained for the solar project.</li>
<li>The Galapagos National Park (PNG) approved the Environmental Impact Assessment.</li>
<li>Executed a pre-feasibility study which estimated the potential PV solar energy to be fed into the Island grid.</li>
</ul>
<img alt=""Yosef meeting with the Mayor of San Cristóbal"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-9X6rZh7Pr3E/UPLkUrvbIlI/AAAAAAAAACs/F6VkwNRZIOE/s640/Meeting%2520with%2520Mayor%2520of%2520San%2520Cristobal.JPG"" src="""" style=""margin-left: 80px; margin-right: 80px;"" title=""Yosef meeting with the Mayor of San Cristóbal""/>
</div>
<div><em>                                         Yosef meeting with the Mayor of San Cristóbal</em></div>
<div>
<h2>What We Need</h2>
<p>With your help, we need to raise $250,000 in order to build the field and start supplying clean energy to the Galápagos.  </p>
<p>Specifically, the money will be spent on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Final pre-development costs including the grid connection design and the final electricity study.</li>
<li>Down payment to the EPC (Engineering, Procurement and Construction) company that will build the project. The down payment will ensure the EPC company can start moving forward with the shipping of the necessary equipment to the Galapagos in time to meet the Ecuadorian regulator's deadline for the project to be built and interconnected.</li>
</ul>
<p>Meanwhile, we need to put a $25,000 deposit down to allow us to continue building the field. Therefore, we have changed the goal of this campaign from $250,000 to $25,000 in order to help us meet this imminent deadline. </p>
<h2>What You Get</h2>
We need your help, so we want you to feel part of the campaign and every contribution, big or small, is important to us. Everyone who contributes $36 or more will receive a thank you postcard signed by Captain Sunshine sent from the Galápagos. We of course have great T-shirts, hats, solar electricity producing backpacks, and other souvenirs that we will be giving away as rewards and we will be updating our rewards frequently, so please check in with us often.</div>
<div>
<br/>We want our contributors to feel ownership over the solar field and know that it was built because of you. For contributors who give $500 we will inscribe your name into our contributors monument that we will be erecting next to the solar field. For contributors who want to contribute the cost of an entire solar panel - $1000 - we will dedicate the panel to you or anyone you choose with an engraved plaque that will be placed next to the panel.</div>
<div>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>Currently, the Galápagos relies mainly on dirty diesel oil for electricity, which needs to be shipped across the ocean in heavy polluting boats. Every week the solar field will replace the burning of 20 barrels of oil (842 US Gallons), that's 930 barrels of oil (147,000 Liters or 39,000 US Gallons) a year not being shipped to the Galápagos and burned there.</p>
<p>The reliance on diesel oil poses an enormous threat to the environment and the species that live on the Galápagos. In 2001, the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MV_Jessica"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""MV Jessica"">oil tanker 'Jessica'</a>, on its way to an oil port transfer station in the Galápagos, scraped against the seabed causing the boat to fill with water and capsize, spilling the oil contents of the boat into the sea: a total of 175,000 US gallons (660,000 L) of diesel and fuel were spilled. It was one of the worst environmental disasters in the archipelago's history.</p>
<p><img alt=""Cleaning up the oil spilled in the Galapagos"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.latimes.com/includes/soundslides/oil-spill-history/oilspill07.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;"" title=""Cleaning up the oil spilled in the Galapagos""/><img alt=""Iguana watches oil spill"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/assets/2002/06/06/200260611.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;"" title=""Iguana watches oil spill""/></p>
<p>Every dollar you contribute to this campaign will not just help build the solar field in the Galápagos, it will also send a message about the importance and feasibility of solar energy. After the successful creation of the solar field in San Cristóbal, we will prove once again the benefits of replacing fossil fuels with renewable and clean energy, shining the way forward for more solar projects throughout the world.</p>
</div>

An entrepreneur, environmentalist and human rights activist, Yosef has established Energiya Global to bring solar power on a commercial basis to developing nations. Yosef was named to the Jerusalem Post's list of 50 most influential Jews worldwide in 2011 and 2012 and has been co-nominated 3 times for the Nobel Peace Prize. Yosef was also awarded ""Person of the Year"" by the 2012 Israel Energy and Business Convention.</p></div>","About the Solar Field in the Galápagos
Yosef Abramowitz, A.K.A. 'Captain Sunshine', who has been recognized by CNN as one of six leading green pioneers on the planet and the Co-founder of Energiya Global, needs your help to build a 300KW solar power field on San Cristóbal Island in the Galápagos.
 

                                                                   San Cristóbal Island

 
Yosef is accustomed to building large solar fields with big investors, but the solar field in the Galápagos is too small a project for these investors, they see it as small potatoes. Yosef and Energiya Global hope that they will break even from the field only in 15 years, so they have committed to donating all the profits back into the Galápagos community.Charles Darwin Research Station

 
Worried about the impact a solar field will have on the environment there? So is Captain Sunshine, that is why we are building the field on an old garbage dump.

                       Existing garbage dump soon to be replaced with our solar field


Where We Are Today
We have completed almost all of the pre-development stages including:

1.5 hectares of land in San Cristobal secured via a 15 years land lease with the municipality.
A Certificate of Intersection was obtained for the solar project.
The Galapagos National Park (PNG) approved the Environmental Impact Assessment.
Executed a pre-feasibility study which estimated the potential PV solar energy to be fed into the Island grid.



                                         Yosef meeting with the Mayor of San Cristóbal

What We Need
With your help, we need to raise $250,000 in order to build the field and start supplying clean energy to the Galápagos.  
Specifically, the money will be spent on the following:

Final pre-development costs including the grid connection design and the final electricity study.
Down payment to the EPC (Engineering, Procurement and Construction) company that will build the project. The down payment will ensure the EPC company can start moving forward with the shipping of the necessary equipment to the Galapagos in time to meet the Ecuadorian regulator's deadline for the project to be built and interconnected.

Meanwhile, we need to put a $25,000 deposit down to allow us to continue building the field. Therefore, we have changed the goal of this campaign from $250,000 to $25,000 in order to help us meet this imminent deadline. 
What You Get
We need your help, so we want you to feel part of the campaign and every contribution, big or small, is important to us. Everyone who contributes $36 or more will receive a thank you postcard signed by Captain Sunshine sent from the Galápagos. We of course have great T-shirts, hats, solar electricity producing backpacks, and other souvenirs that we will be giving away as rewards and we will be updating our rewards frequently, so please check in with us often.

We want our contributors to feel ownership over the solar field and know that it was built because of you. For contributors who give $500 we will inscribe your name into our contributors monument that we will be erecting next to the solar field. For contributors who want to contribute the cost of an entire solar panel - $1000 - we will dedicate the panel to you or anyone you choose with an engraved plaque that will be placed next to the panel.

The Impact
Currently, the Galápagos relies mainly on dirty diesel oil for electricity, which needs to be shipped across the ocean in heavy polluting boats. Every week the solar field will replace the burning of 20 barrels of oil (842 US Gallons), that's 930 barrels of oil (147,000 Liters or 39,000 US Gallons) a year not being shipped to the Galápagos and burned there.
The reliance on diesel oil poses an enormous threat to the environment and the species that live on the Galápagos. In 2001, the oil tanker 'Jessica', on its way to an oil port transfer station in the Galápagos, scraped against the seabed causing the boat to fill with water and capsize, spilling the oil contents of the boat into the sea: a total of 175,000 US gallons (660,000 L) of diesel and fuel were spilled. It was one of the worst environmental disasters in the archipelago's history.

Every dollar you contribute to this campaign will not just help build the solar field in the Galápagos, it will also send a message about the importance and feasibility of solar energy. After the successful creation of the solar field in San Cristóbal, we will prove once again the benefits of replacing fossil fuels with renewable and clean energy, shining the way forward for more solar projects throughout the world.


Other Ways You Can Help

Please remember to tell your friends and family about this campaign so they can be a part of it too. We need all the help we can get. Captain Sunshine needs you!

Cob building in its purest form uses nothing but hands and feet to mix sand, straw and other ingredients into a solid mass used to build walls. Cob is relatively easy to learn, and costs far less compared to a standard home and can be created for even less than your average Tiny Home.Earth homes are cool in summer, warm in winter. Cob's resistance to many elements make it the perfect building medium.Why the Mountains?Land in my experience is cheaper where people believe it will be harder to develop, to that end with our budget we have decided that KY, NC or TN would be perfectly suited to our project.As well as our video blogs I hope to use my passion for photography to take photographs of the nature that inhabits our land and the surrounding area.About MeI am a 35 year old British citizen living in the USA for 10 years now. I am a Computer Developer / Website Developer by trade but also run a popular online newspaper with 10,000 monthly readers.Over the last few years the newspaper has drawn me into photography and I have spent many days hiking in nature enjoying the outdoors.I guess you could say I want a change of direction and I believe sharing my experiences will not only make me a better person but will I hope in some ways show the rest of America and the world that there is another way to live that does not depend solely on consumerism and buying bigger and better!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Why the Floreana mockingbird?</h3>
<p>Floreana island used to be home to a wide range of endemic species including the Floreana mockingbird. Many of these species are now locally extinct due to over 100 years of environmental degradation including habitat loss and impacts from invasive species. </p>
<p>The restoration of this wonderful island is crucial for historical as well as environmental reasons. The curious Floreana mockingbird is historically important as it holds a very special place in science. During the HMS Beagle voyage of 1835, Charles Darwin developed his 'theory of natural selection' with inspiration from the Galapagos mockingbirds, as the four species of mockingbird have evolved from a common ancestor on the Islands.</p>
<p>The restoration of suitable habitat, including the prickly pear cactus from which the mockingbirds feed, would improve conditions and help repair and restore the fragile ecosystem, giving the mockingbirds and other endemic species a chance to repopulate Floreana.</p>
<p><i><strong>We need your help to end this ecological nightmare and bring the Floreana mockingbird back home.</strong></i></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>By donating to this appeal, you will be supporting one of the most ambitious conservation restoration projects in history with a strong supporter and partner network including the Galapagos National Park, Dr Luis Ortiz-Catedral, Island Conservation, and Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485344000/begp5qpeb83ftoewdttb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We aim to repair and restore Floreana island back to its former ecological glory. With your support, we will do this by working to remove all  invasive species from across the island and helping to rebuild the populations of native terrestrial animals, as well as native plants. This will be done with a view to eventually moving some of the breeding pairs of Floreana mockingbirds from their existing tiny populations on Gardener and Champion islets back to the larger Floreana, giving them a chance of recovering their dwindling numbers.</p>

</div></div>","Why the Floreana mockingbird?
Floreana island used to be home to a wide range of endemic species including the Floreana mockingbird. Many of these species are now locally extinct due to over 100 years of environmental degradation including habitat loss and impacts from invasive species. 
The restoration of this wonderful island is crucial for historical as well as environmental reasons. The curious Floreana mockingbird is historically important as it holds a very special place in science. During the HMS Beagle voyage of 1835, Charles Darwin developed his 'theory of natural selection' with inspiration from the Galapagos mockingbirds, as the four species of mockingbird have evolved from a common ancestor on the Islands.
The restoration of suitable habitat, including the prickly pear cactus from which the mockingbirds feed, would improve conditions and help repair and restore the fragile ecosystem, giving the mockingbirds and other endemic species a chance to repopulate Floreana.
We need your help to end this ecological nightmare and bring the Floreana mockingbird back home.

What We Need & What You Get
By donating to this appeal, you will be supporting one of the most ambitious conservation restoration projects in history with a strong supporter and partner network including the Galapagos National Park, Dr Luis Ortiz-Catedral, Island Conservation, and Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust.


The Impact
We aim to repair and restore Floreana island back to its former ecological glory. With your support, we will do this by working to remove all  invasive species from across the island and helping to rebuild the populations of native terrestrial animals, as well as native plants. This will be done with a view to eventually moving some of the breeding pairs of Floreana mockingbirds from their existing tiny populations on Gardener and Champion islets back to the larger Floreana, giving them a chance of recovering their dwindling numbers.

<p>Completion of the interior construction of the central geodesic dome of the project that has been already in use for more than a year now. This means insulating the floor and adding the final wood flooring on top of the temporary wooden tables that exist now.  </p>

<h4><ul><li>The Geodesic Dome Update</li></ul></h4>
<div>Even though the central geodesic dome has served the project well for the past year and a half, it is time for this necessary update to the floor. Since it is not completely finished, meaning it's not closed shut all round the structure, we constantly have intruders, in the form of small mammals, coming in and making their own private mouse dome! Also when we have wind from specific directions, it comes through the floor moving everything around, creating unbalances. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We plan to add proper framing on top of the existing floor, then fill the gaps with a special super sustainable insulation that is made from recycled plastic bottles, top on that one more layer of wooden tables and possibly find a very special deal on top of that, to add a proper, finishing touch, flooring.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>This will make the dome impenetrable, and close to the final stages of completion, as was intended originally, for the Telaithrion Project.</div>
<div><div><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1127812/files/20150102133359-COMPOST_fr_test.jpg?1420234439"" src="""" style=""""/></div></div>
<h4><ul><li>The Projects Central Compost Toilets</li></ul></h4>
<div>Constructing this compost toilet structure, has been anticipated for a long time <span>and</span> will basically establish the necessary basic infrastructure for the creation of the Telaithrion Project to continue smoothly in the following years. The structure will be almost totally made from natural materials, and a couple of natural building techniques will be combined during the building process. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Main materials that will be used will be clay, wood, straw, water and sand. It will consist of four individual compost toilets that will share the same wooden roof (image above) and in the front side of the structure there will also be sinks with water supply, <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">that will end
up in a grey water management system that we have already successfully tested.</span>

<h4><ul><li>The Projects Artificial Lake</li></ul></h4>
<div>The lake! A so big and so important part of the final design of the Telaithrion Project. After the initial dig and careful observation for the second year, the behavior of the landscape during all kinds of weather and all seasons, collecting crucial information on how to continue, planting vast amounts of trees, herbs and plants around the banks, we have concluded that the layout of the lake-bed, with a special  (EPDM) membrane, is absolutely necessary in order for the ground pocket to reserve the precious water needed  in order to make the lake a reality!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The (EPDM) membrane is a very expensive material, so we are trying to strike the best deal possible in order to purchase a quantity as big as necessary for us. <p>That is why this part will be achieved only <span>with the complete and beyond success of the
campaign.</span></p>

τεχνητή λίμνη του εγχειρήματος</b></p><p>Η λίμνη είναι ένα από τα μεγαλύτερα
και πιο σημαντικά έργα για την ολοκλήρωση του τελικού σχεδίου για το εγχείρημα
Τελαίθριον. Μετά την αρχική εκσκαφή και την προσεκτική μελέτη για δύο χρόνια
της συμπεριφοράς του τοπίου και του εδάφους, σε όλες τις καιρικές συνθήκες,
μαζέψαμε σημαντικές πληροφορίες για την συνέχεια, φυτεύοντας αμέτρητα δέντρα,
βότανα και φυτά στις όχθες και στο ανάχωμα, καταλήξαμε ότι η τοποθέτηση
μεμβράνης EPDM είναι
απολύτως απαραίτητη ώστε η λίμνη να διατηρεί το νερό και να γίνει η λίμνη
πραγματικότητα!</p><p>Η μεμβράνη EPDM είναι ένα πολύ ακριβό υλικό, και γι’

What is Free and Real and the Telaithrion Project? The Telaithrion Project’s mission is to create the first, much needed, eco-community model in Greece that will work as a school of self-sufficiency and an exemplar model of sustainability, healthy and harmonic living conditions with respect to human values and the ecosystem,  renewable sources of energy, clean and efficient means of transportation, continuous research and education on all relevant topics and technologies, made available equally to all. 
The project is taking place in Evia island for more than 4 1/2 years now with more than 12000 visitors from every corner of the world and a weekly outreach of more than 70000 people! Visit our facebook page by clicking here, to get all the insight from the course of events, from the very first day until now, and feast your eyes on the countless photo albums depicting, your own remarkable and priceless help for everything that is being achieved.

Also don't forget to check out all the videos in the ""Gallery Section""
With this crowd funding campaign, and with your invaluable support, we aim to rise the project to
the next level during 2015


This campaign will raise the necessary funds to complete some or preferably all of the following ongoing projects:
Pimping the GeoDome
Completion of the interior construction of the central geodesic dome of the project that has been already in use for more than a year now. This means insulating the floor and adding the final wood flooring on top of the temporary wooden tables that exist now.  
Compost Structure Array 
Construction of a new compost toilet building that will consist of a number of individual compost toilets. The building will be made from eco-friendly materials and the design is based on deeply researched compost toilet structures from other eco-projects that we have visited and cooperate with.
Lake it Happen!
After  finishing digging and shaping the banks of the artificial lake, which will change the climatic and environmental diversity standards for the forest garden and the rest of the land, and observing and studying the area, for almost two years now, we are ready to apply the special (EPDM) membrane that will basically make the lake a reality. This is third on our list of things we would like to cover after successfully finishing this campaign. 
We will be many steps closer to the Telethrion dream!
  What We Need & What You Get Getting into more detail:


The Geodesic Dome Update
Even though the central geodesic dome has served the project well for the past year and a half, it is time for this necessary update to the floor. Since it is not completely finished, meaning it's not closed shut all round the structure, we constantly have intruders, in the form of small mammals, coming in and making their own private mouse dome! Also when we have wind from specific directions, it comes through the floor moving everything around, creating unbalances. 

We plan to add proper framing on top of the existing floor, then fill the gaps with a special super sustainable insulation that is made from recycled plastic bottles, top on that one more layer of wooden tables and possibly find a very special deal on top of that, to add a proper, finishing touch, flooring.

This will make the dome impenetrable, and close to the final stages of completion, as was intended originally, for the Telaithrion Project.

The Projects Central Compost Toilets
Constructing this compost toilet structure, has been anticipated for a long time and will basically establish the necessary basic infrastructure for the creation of the Telaithrion Project to continue smoothly in the following years. The structure will be almost totally made from natural materials, and a couple of natural building techniques will be combined during the building process. 

Main materials that will be used will be clay, wood, straw, water and sand. It will consist of four individual compost toilets that will share the same wooden roof (image above) and in the front side of the structure there will also be sinks with water supply, that will end
up in a grey water management system that we have already successfully tested.


The Projects Artificial Lake
The lake! A so big and so important part of the final design of the Telaithrion Project. After the initial dig and careful observation for the second year, the behavior of the landscape during all kinds of weather and all seasons, collecting crucial information on how to continue, planting vast amounts of trees, herbs and plants around the banks, we have concluded that the layout of the lake-bed, with a special  (EPDM) membrane, is absolutely necessary in order for the ground pocket to reserve the precious water needed  in order to make the lake a reality!

The (EPDM) membrane is a very expensive material, so we are trying to strike the best deal possible in order to purchase a quantity as big as necessary for us. That is why this part will be achieved only with the complete and beyond success of the
campaign.

   What Will Your Contributions Do 
The impact cannot be measured in words or numbers, but rather through the hugs, smiles and kind words that we receive from the people visiting and volunteering their time and energy to our project throughout the entire year.
By planting inside us, and inside them, seeds of change, we watch both them and ourselves, walk towards a healthier, freer future!


See here our first rookie ""Go"" @ Indiegogo that after all did manage to build the central geodesic dome.
And see here our second successful effort in the indiegogo platform that brought the lake, the mystic yurt and the forest garden closer to completion. 
Lets make this third try our best one ever, hand and hand!

The stress that is put upon our planet today leaves us no other option than to redesign and recreate our culture and most importantly, ourselves. There is no better time than today to change our way of thinking and move forward to a sustainable and balanced future.

""An invasion of armies can be resisted, but not an idea whose time has come"", goes the favorite quote, and now – more than ever – it is obvious that the time has come for a conscious paradigm shift.    Risks & Challenges  
If the amount raised, is less than that needed, it will be saved until we manage to raise the entire amount from other possible sources, or even from running the campaign again.

θόλου του εγχειρήματος, ο οποίος χρησιμοποιείται ήδη εδώ και περισσότερο από ένα
χρόνο. Στην πράξη αυτό σημαίνει μόνωση στο πάτωμα, και πρόσθεση του τελικού
στρώματος του πατώματος πάνω από τις προσωρινές ξύλινες τάβλες που υπάρχουν
εκεί τώρα.Ενότητα
με Κομποστικές ΤουαλέτεςΚατασκευή ενός καινούργιου κτηρίου που
θα περιέχει πολλαπλές ατομικές κομποστικές τουαλέτες. Η κατασκευή θα ολοκληρωθεί
με οικολογικά υλικά, και ο σχεδιασμός θα βασιστεί σε μακροχρόνια έρευνα πάνω
στην κομποστοποίηση από άλλα εγχειρήματα που έχουμε επισκεφτεί και
συνεργαζόμαστε μαζί τους.Λίμνη
μου λιμνούλα μου….Έχει ολοκληρωθεί η εκσκαφή και ο
σχηματισμός της τεχνητής λίμνης, που θα αλλάξει το βιοκλιματικό τοπίο και θα
ενισχύσει την βιοποικιλότητα της περιοχής και θα δώσει ζωή στον δασόκηπο, αλλά
και την γύρω περιοχή. Με την μελέτη της περιοχής για σχεδόν 2 χρόνια τώρα,
είμαστε έτοιμοι να εφαρμόσουμε την ειδική μεμβράνη (EPDM), η οποία θα κάνει την λίμνη
πραγματικότητα. Αυτό είναι το τρίτο στην λίστα μας που θέλουμε να πετύχουμε με
την επιτυχημένη ολοκλήρωση της καμπάνιας μας.Θα είμαστε πολλά βήματα πιο κοντά στο
όνειρο που ονομάζουμε Τελαίθριον!Τι
χρειαζόμαστε και τι κερδίζετε εσείςΜπαίνοντας σε μεγαλύτερη λεπτομέρεια:Η
αναβάθμιση του γεωδετικού θόλουΠαρόλο που ο κεντρικός γεωδαιτικός
θόλος έχει εξυπηρετήσει τις ανάγκες του εγχειρήματος για το τελευταίο ενάμιση
χρόνο, ήρθε η ώρα για την απαραίτητη αναβάθμιση στο πάτωμα. Μιας και δεν είχε
κλείσει ποτέ αεροστεγώς, υπάρχουν συνεχής εισβολές από διάφορους μικρούς μας
φίλους (ποντίκια, σαύρες και άλλα), που σιγά σιγά φτιάχνουν το δικό τους
ιδιωτικό θόλο. Επίσης όταν φυσάει από συγκεκριμένες κατευθύνσεις ο αέρας που
μπαίνει από κάτω, καθιστά τον θόλο αδύνατο να θερμανθεί, και άρα μη λειτουργικό
για τους χειμερινούς μήνες.Σκοπεύουμε να προσθέσουμε ξύλινο
σκελετό πάνω από το υπάρχον πάτωμα και να γεμίσουμε τα κενά με ένα οικολογικό
και βιώσιμο μονωτικό υλικό, από ανακυκλωμένα πλαστικά μπουκάλια, που παράγεται
στην Ελλάδα. Πάνω από αυτό θα μπει άλλο ένα επίπεδο με ξύλινες τάβλες, και
ίσως, αναλόγως την επιτυχία της καμπάνιας, μπει άλλη μία στρώση πατώματος. Αυτό
θα μετατρέψει τον θόλο σε απόρθητο φρούριο, και θα ενισχύσει την βιοκλιματική
του απόδοση, με βάση τον αρχικό σχεδιασμό.Οι
κεντρικές κομποστικές τουαλέτες του εγχειρήματοςΗ κατασκευή της ενότητας των
κομποστικών τουαλετών είναι κάτι που βρίσκεται σε αναμονή εδώ και αρκετό καιρό,
και θα καθιερώσει τις βασικές υποδομές για την ομαλή διεξαγωγή της συνέχειας
της ολοκλήρωσης του εγχειρήματος Τελαίθριον στα επόμενα χρόνια. Η κατασκευή θα
είναι εξ ολοκλήρου από φυσικά υλικά, και σκοπεύουμε να συνδυάσουμε αρκετές
τεχνικές φυσικής δόμησης, για να πετύχουμε το καλύτερο αποτέλεσμα.Τα βασικά υλικά που θα
χρησιμοποιήσουμε είναι ο πηλός, το ξύλο, το άχυρο, το νερό και η άμμος. Θα
περιέχει 4 ανεξάρτητες κομποστικές τουαλέτες που θα μοιράζονται την ίδια ξύλινη
σκεπή, ενώ μπροστά θα υπάρχουν νεροχύτες που το νερό θα καταλήγει σε σύστημα
διαχείρισης γκρίζου νερού το οποίο έχουμε ήδη δοκιμάσει με επιτυχία στο testsiteτου
εγχειρήματος.Η
τεχνητή λίμνη του εγχειρήματοςΗ λίμνη είναι ένα από τα μεγαλύτερα
και πιο σημαντικά έργα για την ολοκλήρωση του τελικού σχεδίου για το εγχείρημα
Τελαίθριον. Μετά την αρχική εκσκαφή και την προσεκτική μελέτη για δύο χρόνια
της συμπεριφοράς του τοπίου και του εδάφους, σε όλες τις καιρικές συνθήκες,
μαζέψαμε σημαντικές πληροφορίες για την συνέχεια, φυτεύοντας αμέτρητα δέντρα,
βότανα και φυτά στις όχθες και στο ανάχωμα, καταλήξαμε ότι η τοποθέτηση
μεμβράνης EPDM είναι
απολύτως απαραίτητη ώστε η λίμνη να διατηρεί το νερό και να γίνει η λίμνη
πραγματικότητα!Η μεμβράνη EPDM είναι ένα πολύ ακριβό υλικό, και γι’
αυτό προσπαθούμε να πετύχουμε την καλύτερη δυνατή προσφορά, για να αγοράσουμε
την ποσότητα που χρειαζόμαστε. Γι’αυτό τον λόγο, αυτό το κομμάτι θα μπορέσει να
ολοκληρωθεί μόνο με την επιτυχημένη ολοκλήρωση αυτής εδώ της καμπάνιας.Πώς
θα επηρεάσει η Συνεισφορά σας;Ο αντίκτυπος της συνεισφοράς δεν
μετριέται ούτε με λέξεις ούτε με νούμερα, αλλά στις αγκαλιές, στα χαμόγελα και
τα ευγενικά λόγια που εισπράττουμε κάθε μέρα από ανθρώπους που μας επισκέπτονται
και που προσφέρουν τον χρόνο τους και την ενέργεια τους μαζί μας, καθ’ όλη την
διάρκεια του χρόνου. Φυτεύοντας μέσα μας και μέσα τους,

The trend is worldwide. In the United States, “bee abundance” of wild bees has declined in all areas leading to increased costs and unstable crop production. Domestic bees are showing the same alarming trends: 44% of beekeeper colonies were lost in the United States between 2015 and 2016 and total winter and summer annual losses are worsening compared with the previous year.</p><p>Aggravating this situation, the demand for pollinators is in fact increasing, reflecting a sharp increase of crop production requiring bee pollination - including a large variety of fruits, vegetables, and crops such as alfalfa fed to livestock. This increase in crop demand combined with continued decline in managed beehives is creating a major imbalance for agriculture, as well as our ecosystems. This crisis is even more wrenching in the broader context of the dramatic decline of insect populations on the planet (a German study revealed that insect populations in several areas of Germany had decreased by 75% between 1989 and 2014).</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1538965949/vn3cf0oytniagirsnrum.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Percentage of beehive losses for each U.S. State</strong></p><p> </p><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>SO WHY ARE BEES DYING?</strong></h2><p>Bee losses stem from multiple interacting causes: An increasingly flowerless landscape together with a dysfunctional food system, linked to ubiquitous exposure to pesticides (neonics, fungicides, and their synergistic actions); weakening immunity leading to mite and virus infestations, and altered behavior; and the more recently discovered toxic effects of EMF (electromagnetic fields) on the bees’ immune system and navigational systems.</p><p>All these factors have resulted in the decline of honey bee populations, leading to so-called Colony Collapse Disorder, or CCD, which occurs when the majority of worker bees in a colony suddenly disappear, leaving behind the queen and essentially collapsing/ breaking-up the colony. It is a Worldwide Trend.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1540564424/h8rrg0mhg5wl7onr1fdi.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3><p> </p><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>CURRENT EFFORTS TO PROTECT BEES!</strong></h2><p>There are currently about 2.5 million bee colonies in the U.S., with thousands of registered beekeepers, both commercial and private. Organizations at the federal level (USDA) and state levels are charged with monitoring the situation and providing support to beekeepers.</p><p>Hundreds of beekeeping associations at community, city and state levels, along with many NGOs and some corporations involved in the food industry, both fund &amp; monitor programs to promote beekeeping, and to help save the bees. These mostly focus on providing better bee nutrition by planting bee-friendly flowers and plants in private and public spaces and limiting/decreasing access to agricultural chemicals. These current efforts only bring temporary relief, a “band-aid” that merely mitigates the situation and delays the eventual bee disappearance we all fear…as the conditions creating the problems worsen.</p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>SHUNGITE MINERAL TO THE RESCUE:</strong></h2><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>DISCOVERING ITS CONNECTION WITH THE BEES.</strong></h2><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1540564699/seyczlvhsub4tbkufuq5.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p><p>Fortunately in 2017, Derek Condit, a beekeeper in Washington State (U.S.), discovered that Shungite, a unique carbon mineral, had the potential to attenuate EMF signals, environmental radiation and mitigate toxicity from agricultural chemicals, all known to cause harm to his bees.</p><p>Below is his amazing story:</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1539556599/rth4mxqwess8r9diqfwe.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>Derek:</strong> “During the previous year of our beekeeping, we experienced the usual sickness and mite symptoms within our beehives, to include large bee losses. After then having researched the amazing properties of Shungite we decided to try it. This was June 2017. We began with just 3 small Shungite nuggets, about the size of marbles.

As the beehives grew, they formed ""swarms/splits"", or separate bee colonies that move from their original beehive to form their own colony in the wild, thus helping to strengthen and diversify the native bee populations. Most amazingly, our bee population grew from about 50,000 bees to over one million bees in a short 11 weeks.</p><p>By the end of 2018, our second year using Shungite, we have yet to lose a single bee colony to CCD, sickness, or disease of any kind. Once relieved of all these harmful burdens, the bees can once again function at their natural peak efficiency. In summary, the introduction of Shungite to the beehives resulted in:</p><ul>
<li>No sickness, disease, or CCD losses</li>
<li>An amazing expansion of the beehives, led by increased production of queens, requiring setting new beehives - all in a single season!</li>
<li>Increased honey production reflecting the expanding colony</li>
<li>Calmer/healthier bees that do not sting (interesting feature for beekeeping beginners)</li>

</h3><p> </p><p>It is urgent to disseminate our crucial Shungite message if we want to protect/save our ecosystem - and indirectly ourselves and humanity - before it is too late!</p><p>Our project aims to do just that: SPREAD THE USE OF SHUNGITE FAR AND WIDE ( in the U.S. and abroad) to existing and potential beekeepers, as well to all organizations involved with bees, and provide them the necessary tools to adequately equip their bee installations with Shungite, INFORMATION AND SUPPORT are to be PROVIDED OPENLY AND FOR FREE, and necessary tools offered at a minimum cost.</p><p><strong>The money raised from the crowdfunding will be used to:</strong></p><p><strong>A. Strengthen and improve the physical infrastructure of the WA State apiary</strong> to make the Condit apiary a demonstration and learning center and general repository of information for beekeeping and Shungite (to include webinars and training seminars). The plan is to eventually open the property to interested visitors – from the general public to existing/potential beekeepers, and those individuals or families interested in spending time close to beehives to in order to absorb the hives’ spiritual/healing properties.</p><p><strong>B. Help and encourage beekeepers switch to Shungite (and ensure the program’s long-term financial self- sufficiency).</strong> This will include a variety of tools from the dissemination of bee shungite protocols to the production and sale of numerous Shungite tool-kits to interested beekeepers (and potential beekeepers) for both honey beehives and solitary bee houses.</p><p>As available/possible, organize and formalize the production and sale of Shungite honeybee queens, particularly to those apiaries that have been devastated by CCD.</p><p>To further strengthen the project funding, and promote the use of natural (totally chemically free) products, the Condit apiary will continue to produce and sell the many honey- based and Shungite- connected, products they currently manufacture on their property.</p><p><strong>C. Organize a broad information/promotion campaign of Shungite beekeeping- worldwide.</strong> This will involve a mix of media (Facebook, Twitter, radio/TV interviews and shows), extensive use of email campaigns, and attendance at selected bee (and other related) conferences either as speaker and/or exhibitor. Our “infrastructure” will include:</p><p>Shungite Beehive Chapters: To facilitate/accelerate messaging and help beekeepers adopt Shungite, we plan to progressively organize one or several chapters in each state, headed by committed and proactive leaders.</p><p>Website: We will expand our current website to include registration/club membership for all beekeepers adopting Shungite, and add a broad toolkit section containing Shungite kits, how-to protocols and other materials. Membership will help monitor the results and performance of individual Shungite beehives, in order to formally and definitively demonstrate Shungite’s effectiveness and eventually publish the results in the public domain.</p><p><strong>Messaging targets will include:</strong></p><ul>
<li>Existing and potential beekeepers, their associations - at community, city and state levels; State and federal organizations involved with agriculture and bee-monitoring programs</li>
<li>Corporations that fund and operate environment and bee-support programs</li>

Three-fourths of the world’s flowering plants and about 35 percent of the world’s food crops (over 130 trees and crop species) depend on bee pollinators to reproduce, with more than 3,500 species of native bees helping increase crop yields. One out of every three bites of food we eat exists because of pollinators like bees and butterflies.</p><p>An often overlooked solution to increasing food production is to improve bee diversity, in order to ensure proper crop pollination, as some pollinators are more efficient at pollination than others. While American agriculture tends to view honeybees as the key pollinator, wild native bees are also important and efficient pollinators. Introducing other bee species – such as mason bees and leafcutter bees - to farms can increase productivity by over 25%, without resorting to dangerous fertilizers or other chemicals.</p><p> </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><i><strong>COLONY COLLAPSE CAUSES</strong></i></h3><p><strong>A Dysfunctional Food System: </strong>Wild bees have been losing their natural habitats as land transitioned into industrial agriculture after World War II. Farmers stopped planting cover crops such as clover and alfalfa, which are very nutritious for bees, and replaced them with synthetic fertilizers. Farmers also started using herbicides to kill weeds, many of which are in fact flowering plants required by bees, and started to grow large mono-culture crops, applying large amounts of pesticides and creating agricultural deserts where flowers and plants necessary for bees’ survival were systematically eliminated. A widely used pesticide called “neonicotinoid”, has affected both commercially bred honey bees and wild bee populations, as all treated plants (including “bee friendly” garden plants) become toxic to all insects interacting with them.(Note: The European Union banned the use of neonicotinoids in 2018). All these chemicals find their way in the bees’ bodies, affecting their health, and into the pollen they gather, and thus the honey you consume.</p><p><strong>Climate: </strong>Warming climate conditions have caused major shifts in plant communities. Studies of the impacts of climate change done on European honey bees, have found that climate change could have a significant impact on stress and disease which, combined with human-induced environmental changes, will hinder the ability of bees to adapt to these changes. While the loss of wild bees can partially be mitigated by the presence of managed honey bees, wild populations remain major pollination contributors.</p><p><strong>EMF (Electric Magnetic Fields): </strong>Today's technologies, such as laptops, TVs, radios, microwave ovens, Wi-Fi routers, smart meters and cell-phones, all use electromagnetic waves to function. These frequencies are extremely harmful to our natural vibrations as well as the bees’ vibrations, disturbing their meridian clocks and navigational systems. This compromises their immunity and natural rejuvenation, making bees more susceptible to disease and pests.</p><p><strong>Mites and Viruses:</strong> The Varroa mite (Varroa destructor) is a lethal parasite that arrived from Asia, jumping from one species to another. This very small, round mite lays eggs that develop within the honeybee brood, eventually growing large enough to pierce an adult honeybee’s exoskeleton and feed off its internal fluid. This mite can destroy entire colonies and is one of the primary factors in CCD. In addition, these mites can act as vector for several damaging viruses and spread diseases between hives.</p><p> </p><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><i>SHUNGITE</i></h2><p style=""text-align: center;""><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1540567124/cvirwjfxqwnyferjokn4.jpg"" src=""""/></i></p><p>A broad range of scientific studies are confirming Shungite’s wide-ranging health and industrial benefits, stemming from its unique molecular structure.

</h2><p><strong>What is Shungite?</strong></p><p>Shungite is a natural mineral made of 98% carbon. It's found in Karelia, Russia near a small settlement called Shunga. Its atoms form fullerenes, which are made of 60 carbon atoms, resembling a soccer ball at the molecular scale. Shungite has been shown to attenuate toxins and radiation in its environment by reversing the electromagnetic fields to a bio-compatible rotation.</p><p><strong>How does Shungite help the bees?</strong></p><p>Numerous studies have shown how harmful an EMF (Electromagnetic Field) or WiFi field can be for bees. Studies have also shown that Shungite can attenuate EMF signals and environmental radiation. Our Shungite beehives have Shungite powder mixed into their exterior paint and we also place Shungite nuggets at their entrance. Once relieved of these harmful EMF burdens, bees can once again function at their natural peak efficiency.</p><p><strong>What are harmful frequencies?</strong></p><p>Everything on Earth has a specific vibration, or frequency: All humans, animals, plants and insects have a certain vibration field that has to be maintained at specific levels to remain healthy. Frequency, i.e. the way in which molecules or atoms of all matter “spin” around one another, can be seen under a high-powered microscope. NASA has been using frequency generators for decades to protect astronauts while they're away from the Earth's natural frequency source. Astronauts found their physical condition deteriorated while in outer space, away from the Schumann Resonance (Earth’s own frequency of about 7.8 Hz) and while being in the presence of the strong magnetic fields of the space shuttles. This problem was solved by introducing the ""Schumann Simulator"" into all space shuttles, a magnetic pulse generator that broadcast Earth’s natural frequency.</p><p><strong>How do frequencies harm the bees?</strong></p><p>Today's technologies, such as computer monitors, laptops, TVs, radios, microwave ovens, Wi-Fi routers, smart meters and cell-phones, all use electromagnetic waves in order to function.These frequencies are extremely harmful to our natural (human) as well as the bees vibrations. When the bees vibration field or frequency is disharmonious, their meridian clocks are disturbed, immunity is compromised, natural recovery and rejuvenation abilities are reduced, in turn making them more susceptible to diseases and pests.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535839312/ujo2zovhyvmoqcjihgro.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""http://www.ShungiteHoney.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>www.ShungiteHoney.com</strong></a></h3><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p style=""text-align: center;"">View Shungite Honey Information Flyer: <a href=""https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/60e1ff_14bde9115f72426ea7fb906d8c0157cd.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Download.pdf</a></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p></div>","MIRACLE OF SHUNGITE:PROTECT/SAVE ALL BEES TODAY! A CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER FOR OUR ECOSYSTEM; BEES ARE DYING!  A DIRE SITUATION FOR OUR POLLINATORSBees have been dying at a terrifying rate over the past decades, and are in danger of disappearing from our environment. The trend is worldwide. In the United States, “bee abundance” of wild bees has declined in all areas leading to increased costs and unstable crop production. Domestic bees are showing the same alarming trends: 44% of beekeeper colonies were lost in the United States between 2015 and 2016 and total winter and summer annual losses are worsening compared with the previous year.Aggravating this situation, the demand for pollinators is in fact increasing, reflecting a sharp increase of crop production requiring bee pollination - including a large variety of fruits, vegetables, and crops such as alfalfa fed to livestock. This increase in crop demand combined with continued decline in managed beehives is creating a major imbalance for agriculture, as well as our ecosystems. This crisis is even more wrenching in the broader context of the dramatic decline of insect populations on the planet (a German study revealed that insect populations in several areas of Germany had decreased by 75% between 1989 and 2014).Percentage of beehive losses for each U.S. State SO WHY ARE BEES DYING?Bee losses stem from multiple interacting causes: An increasingly flowerless landscape together with a dysfunctional food system, linked to ubiquitous exposure to pesticides (neonics, fungicides, and their synergistic actions); weakening immunity leading to mite and virus infestations, and altered behavior; and the more recently discovered toxic effects of EMF (electromagnetic fields) on the bees’ immune system and navigational systems.All these factors have resulted in the decline of honey bee populations, leading to so-called Colony Collapse Disorder, or CCD, which occurs when the majority of worker bees in a colony suddenly disappear, leaving behind the queen and essentially collapsing/ breaking-up the colony. It is a Worldwide Trend.  CURRENT EFFORTS TO PROTECT BEES!There are currently about 2.5 million bee colonies in the U.S., with thousands of registered beekeepers, both commercial and private. Organizations at the federal level (USDA) and state levels are charged with monitoring the situation and providing support to beekeepers.Hundreds of beekeeping associations at community, city and state levels, along with many NGOs and some corporations involved in the food industry, both fund & monitor programs to promote beekeeping, and to help save the bees. These mostly focus on providing better bee nutrition by planting bee-friendly flowers and plants in private and public spaces and limiting/decreasing access to agricultural chemicals. These current efforts only bring temporary relief, a “band-aid” that merely mitigates the situation and delays the eventual bee disappearance we all fear…as the conditions creating the problems worsen. SHUNGITE MINERAL TO THE RESCUE:DISCOVERING ITS CONNECTION WITH THE BEES.Fortunately in 2017, Derek Condit, a beekeeper in Washington State (U.S.), discovered that Shungite, a unique carbon mineral, had the potential to attenuate EMF signals, environmental radiation and mitigate toxicity from agricultural chemicals, all known to cause harm to his bees.Below is his amazing story:Derek: “During the previous year of our beekeeping, we experienced the usual sickness and mite symptoms within our beehives, to include large bee losses. After then having researched the amazing properties of Shungite we decided to try it. This was June 2017. We began with just 3 small Shungite nuggets, about the size of marbles. They were placed at one of our two beehives entrances, then observed and took notes over the coming weeks of any changes.Over the 2017 Spring, Summer and Fall honey seasons, these ""Shungite Bees"" continued to rapidly expand in numbers, remained disease and CCD free, and no longer showed signs of common honey bee diseases prevalent in our area. As the beehives grew, they formed ""swarms/splits"", or separate bee colonies that move from their original beehive to form their own colony in the wild, thus helping to strengthen and diversify the native bee populations. Most amazingly, our bee population grew from about 50,000 bees to over one million bees in a short 11 weeks.By the end of 2018, our second year using Shungite, we have yet to lose a single bee colony to CCD, sickness, or disease of any kind. Once relieved of all these harmful burdens, the bees can once again function at their natural peak efficiency. In summary, the introduction of Shungite to the beehives resulted in:
No sickness, disease, or CCD losses
An amazing expansion of the beehives, led by increased production of queens, requiring setting new beehives - all in a single season!
Increased honey production reflecting the expanding colony
Calmer/healthier bees that do not sting (interesting feature for beekeeping beginners)
While the original bee colony remained and continued to grow in the beehive, the swarm portion relocated into nearby mountains, helping to diversify local bee genetics and also expand the bee numbers. Example: Honeybees preferring to be near Shungite We have started to contact other Beekeepers in the US and abroad to spread the message/information and have answered many beekeepers’ calls; there are now over two dozen apiaries in 9 countries (including the U.S.) duplicating our research. Further we are collecting numerous testimonials from these beekeepers, which confirm the amazing effectiveness of shungite on bees’ health and beehive growth.   OUR URGENT PROJECT TO SAVE THE BEES:SHUNGITE, AN EFFECTIVE, IMMEDIATE AND DEFINITIVE SOLUTION! 
PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND PLANS
 It is urgent to disseminate our crucial Shungite message if we want to protect/save our ecosystem - and indirectly ourselves and humanity - before it is too late!Our project aims to do just that: SPREAD THE USE OF SHUNGITE FAR AND WIDE ( in the U.S. and abroad) to existing and potential beekeepers, as well to all organizations involved with bees, and provide them the necessary tools to adequately equip their bee installations with Shungite, INFORMATION AND SUPPORT are to be PROVIDED OPENLY AND FOR FREE, and necessary tools offered at a minimum cost.The money raised from the crowdfunding will be used to:A. Strengthen and improve the physical infrastructure of the WA State apiary to make the Condit apiary a demonstration and learning center and general repository of information for beekeeping and Shungite (to include webinars and training seminars). The plan is to eventually open the property to interested visitors – from the general public to existing/potential beekeepers, and those individuals or families interested in spending time close to beehives to in order to absorb the hives’ spiritual/healing properties.B. Help and encourage beekeepers switch to Shungite (and ensure the program’s long-term financial self- sufficiency). This will include a variety of tools from the dissemination of bee shungite protocols to the production and sale of numerous Shungite tool-kits to interested beekeepers (and potential beekeepers) for both honey beehives and solitary bee houses.As available/possible, organize and formalize the production and sale of Shungite honeybee queens, particularly to those apiaries that have been devastated by CCD.To further strengthen the project funding, and promote the use of natural (totally chemically free) products, the Condit apiary will continue to produce and sell the many honey- based and Shungite- connected, products they currently manufacture on their property.C. Organize a broad information/promotion campaign of Shungite beekeeping- worldwide. This will involve a mix of media (Facebook, Twitter, radio/TV interviews and shows), extensive use of email campaigns, and attendance at selected bee (and other related) conferences either as speaker and/or exhibitor. Our “infrastructure” will include:Shungite Beehive Chapters: To facilitate/accelerate messaging and help beekeepers adopt Shungite, we plan to progressively organize one or several chapters in each state, headed by committed and proactive leaders.Website: We will expand our current website to include registration/club membership for all beekeepers adopting Shungite, and add a broad toolkit section containing Shungite kits, how-to protocols and other materials. Membership will help monitor the results and performance of individual Shungite beehives, in order to formally and definitively demonstrate Shungite’s effectiveness and eventually publish the results in the public domain.Messaging targets will include:
Existing and potential beekeepers, their associations - at community, city and state levels; State and federal organizations involved with agriculture and bee-monitoring programs
Corporations that fund and operate environment and bee-support programs
Public and private organizations involved in sustainable and organic agriculture, and NGOs with a variety of agendas, including reduction of chemical/pesticide use, etc...
Academia (biologists, etymologists) with a particular interest in biodiversity (and bees) in an effort to generate research and articles to be published in journals.
Agriculture and bee organizations in selected foreign countries, active in sustainable agriculture, and concerned with the plight of bees (Europe for instance).
 
​SCHEDULE
 The Project will start immediately, upon the funding of this campaign has been obtained. Initial steps will involve building the “supporting infrastructure“ for the Project. Very aware of the urgency of our effort, we plan our promotion/information campaign to be fully engaged in 2019 and 2020. We intend to keep all of our supporters regularly informed of the progress of our campaign and of milestones we reach. 
GOAL AND MILESTONES

Expand our Washington State apiary to double the number of Shungite Beehives for research.
Explore opportunities to visit/speak at bee associations & conferences throughout the year.
Expand our ability to provide Free Shungite Queen Bees to beekeepers who have experienced devastating losses from CCD.
Explore additional ways to incorporate and expand our use of Shungite to save the bees, thus saving ourselves.
Expand/organize one or several Shungite Beehive Chapters with a knowledgeable dedicated chapter leader for contact information & active promotion of Shungite use by beekeepers.
Chapter leaders will share/distribute the Shungite Beehives Protocol/Kits and assist beekeepers with their Shungite conversions,
Attend as many beekeeping conferences as possible throughout the year, as either an exhibitor or speaker.
Our goal is to have 15 Shungite beehive chapters in place by the end of 2019, then by the end of 2020 we hope to have a chapter in each U.S. state.

 SUPPORT OUR CRUCIAL PROJECT!Save the Bees, Save US!    ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON BEES, SHUNGITE AND FAQs BEESSocial Bees: Honey BeesOf the 20,000 species of bees, honey bees are the most charismatic representatives and have been around over 30 million years. Among seven recognized species of honey bees, the most popular is the Western honey bee (Apis mellifera). Although not native, honeybees have been raised in America for centuries and we largely rely on their pollination efforts for our food production.Solitary Bees: Mason Bees, Leafcutter Bees, BumblebeesClose relatives of the honey bee, the gentle Mason bees are native to North America and are super pollinators, pollinating up to 100 times more effectively than honey bees. They carry pollen dry on the underside of their abdomen, allowing the pollen to fall easily as their large abdominal surface touches more of the flower’s anthers and stigmas.Leafcutter bees are hard-working solitary pollinators specialized in pollinating alfalfa, an important crop for livestock; the bumblebee is a hairier and more robust cousin of honey bees. BEE DIVERSITY: A PROFOUND CONTRIBUTOR TO SUSTAINABLE FOOD PRODUCTION Bee help with pollination of fruits, vegetables, nuts & more All species of bees provide crucial ecosystem services, with far-reaching effects on their respective habitats and environments. Three-fourths of the world’s flowering plants and about 35 percent of the world’s food crops (over 130 trees and crop species) depend on bee pollinators to reproduce, with more than 3,500 species of native bees helping increase crop yields. One out of every three bites of food we eat exists because of pollinators like bees and butterflies.An often overlooked solution to increasing food production is to improve bee diversity, in order to ensure proper crop pollination, as some pollinators are more efficient at pollination than others. While American agriculture tends to view honeybees as the key pollinator, wild native bees are also important and efficient pollinators. Introducing other bee species – such as mason bees and leafcutter bees - to farms can increase productivity by over 25%, without resorting to dangerous fertilizers or other chemicals. COLONY COLLAPSE CAUSESA Dysfunctional Food System: Wild bees have been losing their natural habitats as land transitioned into industrial agriculture after World War II. Farmers stopped planting cover crops such as clover and alfalfa, which are very nutritious for bees, and replaced them with synthetic fertilizers. Farmers also started using herbicides to kill weeds, many of which are in fact flowering plants required by bees, and started to grow large mono-culture crops, applying large amounts of pesticides and creating agricultural deserts where flowers and plants necessary for bees’ survival were systematically eliminated. A widely used pesticide called “neonicotinoid”, has affected both commercially bred honey bees and wild bee populations, as all treated plants (including “bee friendly” garden plants) become toxic to all insects interacting with them.(Note: The European Union banned the use of neonicotinoids in 2018). All these chemicals find their way in the bees’ bodies, affecting their health, and into the pollen they gather, and thus the honey you consume.Climate: Warming climate conditions have caused major shifts in plant communities. Studies of the impacts of climate change done on European honey bees, have found that climate change could have a significant impact on stress and disease which, combined with human-induced environmental changes, will hinder the ability of bees to adapt to these changes. While the loss of wild bees can partially be mitigated by the presence of managed honey bees, wild populations remain major pollination contributors.EMF (Electric Magnetic Fields): Today's technologies, such as laptops, TVs, radios, microwave ovens, Wi-Fi routers, smart meters and cell-phones, all use electromagnetic waves to function. These frequencies are extremely harmful to our natural vibrations as well as the bees’ vibrations, disturbing their meridian clocks and navigational systems. This compromises their immunity and natural rejuvenation, making bees more susceptible to disease and pests.Mites and Viruses: The Varroa mite (Varroa destructor) is a lethal parasite that arrived from Asia, jumping from one species to another. This very small, round mite lays eggs that develop within the honeybee brood, eventually growing large enough to pierce an adult honeybee’s exoskeleton and feed off its internal fluid. This mite can destroy entire colonies and is one of the primary factors in CCD. In addition, these mites can act as vector for several damaging viruses and spread diseases between hives. SHUNGITEA broad range of scientific studies are confirming Shungite’s wide-ranging health and industrial benefits, stemming from its unique molecular structure. Studies are showing Shungite's protection against harmful effects of EMF radiation (Electromagnetic frequencies, emitted by cell phones, computers, cordless phones, microwave ovens, Wi-Fi routers, and other electronic devices) and its effectiveness in treating infections, inflammation, allergies, high blood pressure, osteoarthritis and digestive problems.Shungite has been used for medical treatment in Russia since the early 18th century, largely used to purify water and for the treatment of depression, and various mental/emotional problems. In the world of physical healing, Shungite is regarded as a “Miracle Stone” and is intensively used by crystal and energy healers around the world.  
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:
What is Shungite?Shungite is a natural mineral made of 98% carbon. It's found in Karelia, Russia near a small settlement called Shunga. Its atoms form fullerenes, which are made of 60 carbon atoms, resembling a soccer ball at the molecular scale. Shungite has been shown to attenuate toxins and radiation in its environment by reversing the electromagnetic fields to a bio-compatible rotation.How does Shungite help the bees?Numerous studies have shown how harmful an EMF (Electromagnetic Field) or WiFi field can be for bees. Studies have also shown that Shungite can attenuate EMF signals and environmental radiation. Our Shungite beehives have Shungite powder mixed into their exterior paint and we also place Shungite nuggets at their entrance. Once relieved of these harmful EMF burdens, bees can once again function at their natural peak efficiency.What are harmful frequencies?Everything on Earth has a specific vibration, or frequency: All humans, animals, plants and insects have a certain vibration field that has to be maintained at specific levels to remain healthy. Frequency, i.e. the way in which molecules or atoms of all matter “spin” around one another, can be seen under a high-powered microscope. NASA has been using frequency generators for decades to protect astronauts while they're away from the Earth's natural frequency source. Astronauts found their physical condition deteriorated while in outer space, away from the Schumann Resonance (Earth’s own frequency of about 7.8 Hz) and while being in the presence of the strong magnetic fields of the space shuttles. This problem was solved by introducing the ""Schumann Simulator"" into all space shuttles, a magnetic pulse generator that broadcast Earth’s natural frequency.How do frequencies harm the bees?Today's technologies, such as computer monitors, laptops, TVs, radios, microwave ovens, Wi-Fi routers, smart meters and cell-phones, all use electromagnetic waves in order to function.These frequencies are extremely harmful to our natural (human) as well as the bees vibrations. When the bees vibration field or frequency is disharmonious, their meridian clocks are disturbed, immunity is compromised, natural recovery and rejuvenation abilities are reduced, in turn making them more susceptible to diseases and pests. www.ShungiteHoney.com View Shungite Honey Information Flyer: Download.pdf",25.0,1,"1 Campaign

Adults weigh between 180-300 kg. They are about 1.10 meters high and, in some cases, more than two meters long. Their home ranges are enormous, with an average of ca. 500 hectares or, in other words, 500 soccer fields!</p><p>Tapirs are forest animals. They prefer gallery/riparian forests along and around water bodies. Nevertheless, they use other habitat types to forage for food and/or travel between different parts of their home ranges. They have the ability to move through the landscape in between patches of forest thus connecting different habitat types. For this reason, tapirs are widely known as <i>ecological detectives</i> or <i>landscape species</i> - they help us understand the inter-relations between different components of the landscape mosaic. Furthermore, tapirs are herbivorous animals, feeding mostly on fruits, buds and leaves. The fruits eaten by tapirs are swallowed with their seeds. When the seeds pass through the digestive tract of the tapir, they have their germination ability enhanced. Thus, the tapir has a key role in seed dispersal, carrying seeds in their stomach for long distances within their home ranges. For this reason, tapirs are known as <i>gardeners of the forest</i>.</p><p>The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species lists the lowland tapir as VULNERABLE TO EXTINCTION. Human activities – such as road-kill, poaching, pesticide contamination, habitat destruction and fragmentation, large scale agriculture, cattle ranching, mining and expansion of palm oil plantations – have been drastically affecting tapir populations in Brazil.</p><p>Lowland tapis have a low reproductive rate and a long generation time. Gestation lasts for approximately 13-14 months, and the female gives birth to only one calf. After giving birth, the female takes about 4-5 months to get into heat again. Thus, an adult female must produce only one calf every 18-24 months. In addition to that, tapirs are solitary animals and because of their large home ranges, the number of individuals in a given tapir population is naturally low. Due to these characteristics, the recovery of an affected tapir population is extremely slow. Any impact they suffer have drastic effects on the population, which makes them highly susceptible to threats. Population declines or local extinctions can trigger adverse effects on ecosystems, affecting ecological processes and eventually compromising the integrity and biodiversity of these ecosystems.</p><p>By establishing tapir research and conservation programs in different Brazilian biomes, the LTCI aims to create a comparative approach to the conservation of the species. Thus, we will have a clearer understanding of these animals in different biomes with different landscape contexts and under different levels of environmental disturbance. Thereby, we will be able to better understand the ecology of these animals and their needs, and to evaluate the importance and magnitude of the ecological factors affecting the different populations in the country. Finally, we will have all the necessary tools to promote the development and effective implementation of conservation and management strategies for specific lowland tapir populations throughout their distribution range.</p><p align=""center""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1552249916/rxc7befnlowz7sa7o9lm.png"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1552325381/hlewd72fag6vj79ktwtb.jpg"" src=""""/><br/><strong>Photo by INCAB-IPÊ</strong></p><p> </p><p>The LTCI is a long-term, nation-wide conservation effort led by Brazilian conservationist Patrícia Medici. The LTCI was first established in 1996 in the Atlantic Forest, one of the most threatened biomes on the planet. The Atlantic Forest Tapir Program was a pioneer, long-term project, which included studies in basic tapir ecology, health, genetics and effects of habitat fragmentation, as well as promotion of community involvement, environmental education and habitat restoration efforts.</p><p>In 2008, the LTCI expanded to the Pantanal, the largest continuous freshwater wetland on the planet. Several conventions have recognized the Pantanal as an important wetland (Ramsar, Convention on Biological Diversity, UN Convention on Climate Change, Convention on Migratory Species). Nevertheless, current intensification of traditional cattle ranching practices in use in the Pantanal for the past 200 years is threatening this biome. The main goal of the Pantanal Tapir Program has been to collect ecological, demographic, health and genetic data to assess the status and viability of tapir populations in the region.</p><p>In 2015, Dr Medici expanded to the Cerrado, the most extensive woodland/savannah region in South America. The second largest of Brazil's ecoregions, after the Amazon, this conservation hotspot accounts for 25% of the country's land area. This biome is the epicenter of economic development in Brazil, where most of the expansion of Brazil's agricultural frontier, which focuses primarily on sugar cane, soybean and corn, takes place. Cattle ranching is another threat to tapirs in the region, as it produces almost 40 million cattle a year. The main goal of the LTCI in the Cerrado has been to evaluate the impact of threats on tapir populations and design strategies to mitigate those threats, while finding ways to conserve and protect the remaining habitat. Threats in the Cerrado include deforestation and fragmentation, road-kill, poaching, the expansion of agriculture, and pesticide contamination.</p><p>Watch Patricia Medici's TED TALK and learn more about lowland tapirs and the work of the Lowland Tapir Conservation Initiative in Brazil.: </p><div>

Threats in the Cerrado include deforestation and fragmentation, road-kill, poaching, the expansion of agriculture, and pesticide contamination.Watch Patricia Medici's TED TALK and learn more about lowland tapirs and the work of the Lowland Tapir Conservation Initiative in Brazil.:

 The LTCI staff is now preparing to establish its FOURTH AND FINAL tapir conservation program in Brazil, the Amazon Tapir Program. The main goal in the Amazon will be to assess and mitigate threats affecting tapirs along the southern belt of deforestation (Rondônia, Mato Grosso and Pará states). Some of the threats we will be dealing with include current habitat destruction for the expansion of large-scale agriculture (mostly soybean) and cattle ranching, unsustainable hunting, mining, expansion of palm oil, road-kill and pesticides.YOU CAN HELP US GET STARTED IN THE AMAZON!!!! Photo by Freepik With your help, we hope to raise the necessary funds to take our first and most important step towards the establishment of our FOURTH and FINAL tapir conservation effort in Brazil, the AMAZON TAPIR PROGRAM!  In June 2019, we will run a scouting expedition to the Amazon. For 30 days, we will be on the move, driving along the southern belt of deforestation for about 5,000 kilometers, crossing three Brazilian states (Rondônia, Mato Grosso, and Pará), and getting face to face with the destruction that is taking place in the region. Along the way, we will cross a mosaic of human activities, including large scale agriculture, cattle ranching, highways, indigenous communities, mining, palm oil plantations as well as sustainable management projects. We will visit dozens of different sites and meet with local conservation organizations and other stakeholders. The team will include six people (further information below). In terms of logistics, we will travel in two 4X4 trucks and bring all the necessary field equipment and supplies for 30 days of scouting, data and sample collection.  We will sleep in small road-side hotels and communities and eat our meals wherever we find food!  The funding goal of the campaign was set based on the necessary budget to run the expedition for 30 days, six people, ca. 5,000 kilometers, and includes: rental of two 4X4 trucks, fuel and vehicle maintenance costs, road tolls, ferry tolls, lodging and meals.Upon completion of the expedition, we will have accumulated all the data and information to allow us to design our new program: 1- the questions we will address in the Amazon and the issues (threats) we will evaluate and work to mitigate, 2- selection of potential study areas, 3- identification of local stakeholders and potential partners, 4- discussions of local logistics and necessary infra-structure, 5- funding needed. We expect the Amazon Tapir Program to have a major focus on evaluating the impact of threats affecting tapirs along the southern belt of deforestation and finding ways to mitigate those threats.Although the LTCI is mostly focused on the conservation of a single species, we are talking about a VERY IMPORTANT, KEY species! Tapirs play a critical role in shaping the structure and maintaining the functioning of ecosystems. Conserving tapirs in the Atlantic Forest, Pantanal, Cerrado, and Amazon will help guarantee the conservation of these important Brazilian biomes. 
Your support is CRITICAL to allow us to run our scouting expedition to the Amazon, and later on design and implement our FOURTH and FINAL tapir conservation program in Brazil, the AMAZON TAPIR PROGRAM!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>We are the staff of The Pelee Island Bird Observatory- Sumiko, Sachiko, Patrick,  Sarah and Suzanne.</li>
<li>We are raising funds to replace our ageing septic system at our research cottage on Pelee Island. This cottage is where our research team lives for nine months of the year and where we host public events on the island.</li>
<li>The Pelee Island Bird Observatory (<a href=""http://pibo.ca/en/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">PIBO)</a> is a non-profit charitable organisation devoted to the study and conservation of birds. The observatory conducts intensive migration-monitoring research and breeding bird studies on Pelee Island from April to November.  A proud member of the Canadian Migration Monitoring Network (CMMN) since 2005, PIBO’s purpose is to collect and disseminate data that will help the CMMN to understand changes taking place in the populations of migratory birds.</li>
<li>A new septic system will ensure that our researchers are not exposed to disease-causing bacteria, that our groundwater is not contaminated and that we will not be contributing to the growth of <a href=""http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/hab/lakeerie.html?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=GovDelivery"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Blue Green Algae in Lake Erie</a>.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We know a lot about birds, but not much about septics.  But some trusted experts have informed us that our current system comprises of a steel tank that is at least 30 years old. Well, steel eventually corrodes,  and corrosion means leakage.  And the leakage of sewage is just not a good idea, mainly when you are located near a large body of water- in our case Lake Erie. So we are raising money towards the installation of a new septic system. Specifically, a <a href=""http://waterloo-biofilter.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Waterloo Biofilter</a>. This system is designed for environmentally sensitive lands and locations that would be challenging for more traditional methods. It will ensure that the water that is filtered through the two-stage system is so clean that we could drink it (but we won't)!</li>
<li>Although the full cost of the new system will be in the $20K + range, we are only asking for a portion of that through Indigogo. Various grants will make up the remainder of the cost.</li>
<li><strong><i>As a reward for your generous donation, we have some  AMAZING PERKS! </i></strong></li>
<li><strong><i> An intimate dinner with Margaret Atwood and Graeme Gibson for you and three of your friends!! Wait what? Yes, you read that right. </i></strong></li>

<li><strong><i>Two tickets to an exclusive dinner with famous Canadian authors and much more! Head over to the perks section and see what else is on offer. </i></strong></li>
<li>If we do not meet our goal, the funds will be held in reserve until we can afford the new system. This project is not optional but a necessity.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>As an environmental organisation, it is essential that we minimise the negative impacts of our daily actions. Pelee Island is very special to us. It is where we conduct our research, where we live and where the thousands of migratory birds that pass through this region spend time for many months of the year.</li>
<li>Failing septic systems may leak excessive nutrients and bacteria into coastal waters, destroying aquatic plant and animal habitat. The many species of birds that call Pelee home depend on a clean water source for their survival.</li>
<li> With up to five researchers living and working at the cottage for most of the year, it is vital that we are part of the solution to keeping our lake clean.</li>
<li>We have had two previous Indigogo campaigns that were very successful-<i>Clean Water for PIBO</i>  raised 104% for a new UV water filtration system, and <i>Monarchs for Moms </i>raised 81% for a new pollinator garden.</li>

<br/>The
Brazilian government is embarking on a far-reaching plan to build a network of dams accross the
Amazon, destroying biodiversity and disrupting the
way of life of thousands of Amerindians and other local populations. Now that the work is well under way on
the huge Belo Monte dam on the Xingu river, the government is pushing ahead

After 13 years waiting for the 'demarcation' of this land and never being listened to by any Brazilian government, the Munduruku Indians, inhabitants of DAJE KAPAP EYPI land, which serves the populations at Middle and Upper Tapajós River, have started the autonomous process of marking out their land, last October 17th, 2014.

2) To legalize the Munduruku Associations ""DA'UK"" and ""PAHYHYP""
To work on their own campaigns, to deal directly with government, and so on, it is a must to have their associations legalized.

<p>The Monkey Den has been an open house hold to adverntuers, parachutists, highliners, climbers, and active people in general. </p>
<p>We have had a lot of people stop by, play in the net, sleep on the floor, cook in the kitchen, use the bathrooms, borrow gear, use it for rescues, highlines, climbs, get beta, and for the most part we never asked for anything in return except for respect of the house and chores while monkeys stayed here. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>What WE need is some help raising money to pay for the fines that have been brought upon us by what the city deemed ""excessively high amounts of traffic,""  as well as fixing the probelms cause by this traffic in and around the Monkey Den.  </p>
<p>While we are paying the fines and refurbishing the house to a resonable standard, we are going to develop a plan of action to OPEN the DEN to Monkeys once more.  It will be a challenge but we will find a way to support our community of adventures in a way that our household can manage, as well as the city can deem as  appropriate.  </p>

What WE need is some help raising money to pay for the fines that have been brought upon us by what the city deemed ""excessively high amounts of traffic,""  as well as fixing the probelms cause by this traffic in and around the Monkey Den.  
While we are paying the fines and refurbishing the house to a resonable standard, we are going to develop a plan of action to OPEN the DEN to Monkeys once more.  It will be a challenge but we will find a way to support our community of adventures in a way that our household can manage, as well as the city can deem as  appropriate.  


 
The Impact


Every donation made will go directly into paying the recent fines imposed on the Monkey Den as well as fixing the damage done to the Den over the last 3 years. 
The more help we get, the faster we can figure out a way to return to status quo. 
 


Other Ways You Can Help
Some people just can’t contribute, which we totolly understand, but that doesn’t mean you can’t help:
Please share this campaign, tell your friends, and especially if you have been to, heard about, seen our videos, or know someone involed with the DEN... please let them know we could use their help at this point in time!

<p><strong>Summary: </strong></p>
<p><strong>A group of Dakota First Nations horsemen and their families will be riding from Manitoba in a symbolic action for the purpose of healing for all living beings and the earth herself at this critical time for our existence.  The riders will travel in the spirit of peace and reconciliation in a sacred fashion. They will journey to the East Coast, making stops throughout the Hudson Valley in NY and beyond, heading south along the Hudson, bringing healing to Sandy Hook, CT, presenting at the United Nations Day of Indigenous Peoples, and riding to the White House, inspiring so many people on the way.  Their home base during this epic trek will be Woodstock, NY, the iconic home of peace.   This is the longest ride undertaken by Gus High Eagle and his riders, but other important rides have been conducted, like the yearly ride to honor the Dakota 38 in Mankato, Minnesota. The purpose of this ride, in the Summer of Unity 2013, according to Gus, is for awakening, for healing.    <br/></strong></p>

</p><p><b>Hi my name is Jessie Wright, thank you for checking out our campaign!</b></p>
<p>As you may have heard, my family is on a mission to live sustainably in a
tiny home. </p>
<p><b>Our family</b> of three has decided that we will make a major
lifestyle change. We are going to downsize our 900 sq ft home into a tiny 200
sq. ft. House on wheels. Our new ""off grid"" home will be built
by us, and made from as many recycled materials as we can employ. We
intend to use solar power, rain collection, composting, and
other sustainable systems. </p>
<p><b>This lifestyle</b> is becoming more and more popular as we seek
stability in an unpredictable economy. Permaculture engineering shows us
how comfortably we can live in an inexpensive, low impact way. Recent articles
suggest it could be the cure for homelessness. </p>
<p><b>Our family's journey</b> will show the world that simplifying is
good for the environment, economy, and overall happiness. We will document our
journey weekly on our blog, ThisTinyHouseFamily.typepad.com.</p>
<p><b>Your contribution</b> is what will kick start this dream into a
reality. Financial institutions don't do loans for tiny homes as
they are not a recognized ""home"". Banks tend to provide for what
is profitable, not sustainable. Being that we have no home to sell to help
pay for the build, and our two year savings is not cutting it, we were advised
to try crowd funding<br/>
(here we are!). You have the power to help one more family show the world that
we can be sustainable and comfortable on a budget that won't require you to
give up 5 days (or more) of your week to pay for it. Even the smallest donation
makes you a big part of taking our culture one more step in the right
direction. </p>
<p><b>Update:</b></p>
<p>We have procured a 25ft trailer from a friend who will have it stripped and
ready for us to take home in a couple of months. Step one is the shell. The
shell is a time sensitive step and the biggest investment. I has to be
completed in a very short amount of time so that all of the materials
retain their strength and shape. I have calculated materials for this step to
cost around $7,800.</p>
<p><b>Why we are crowd funding</b></p>
<p>We have been denied for loans via financial institutions for a variety of
reasons including lack of previous loan history (we like to afford the things
we buy) and the fact that a tiny home is not an easy thing to describe in bank
terms. You know what? We're better off without them. Our mission will now be
financed entirely from contributions, sponsors, and our own pockets instead of
the unpredictable banking system. </p>
<p>This is the beauty of crowd funding. The people of the community who want to
contribute to a global cause can do so by giving a small amount to our mission.</p>

<p><b>Peter Crayton:</b> I am a WEMBA 2013 MBA candidate with about 10
years experience as an Engineer and Innovation Manager with P&amp;G and
Unilever.  I have been in charge of
starting up companies to work with P&amp;G and Unilever as both Suppliers and
Contract manufacturers.  I have built my
own Business in the past starting from scratch and watched it succeed.  I am interested in energy due to the great
Demand we have for this product around the world as well as the personal
satisfaction it would bring to me to have created something beneficial to the
world.  </p>
<p><b> Anup Shah:</b> I am a WEMBA 2013 candidate with about 10
years of experience in the engineering consulting. I have recently started with
Metro Atlanta Chamber as the VP of Environmental Affairs. I have a bachelors
and a master’s degree in Environmental Engineering. I have a keen interest in
the energy and sustainability arena and I am deeply engaged in the water-energy
nexus and policy issues surrounding it. </p>
<p><b>Ryan Smith:</b>  After having spent the first nine plus years
of my career in the Energy industry, specifically in Nuclear, I have witnessed
first-hand the dynamic and dramatic shifts in the landscape for power
generation.  My time with GE in the Power
&amp; Water business has seen the rise, fall, rise, and then fall of the
Nuclear Renaissance, the rapid emergence and then downtown in Wind, and the recent
explosion in gas turbines.  During that
time I have been working with our Nuclear Services business delivering projects
to major Utility customers across the US and in Asia, while also directing
internal projects for technology development following GE’s New Product
Introduction program.  I worked in
mechanical design after graduating with my BSME from NC State, and hope to
continue working around emerging technology in the Energy industry once I
complete my MBA from Fuqua in 2013.  I
see this area of solar energy as an exciting field with vast growth potential
if the right product is brought to market.</p>
<p><b>Charlie Wright:</b> I am a WEMBA 2013 candidate with seven years
of experience in the consumer products and goods industry working for Newell
Rubbermaid.  I have worked in a variety
of supply chain roles and spent the last five years sourcing plastic and metal
components and finished goods across the globe. 
Prior to my work at Newell Rubbermaid, I spent 18 months founding a
microfinance company in Peru. I have an strong interest in solar energy
solutions and look forward to growing this company.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>CROWDFUNDING NEEDS (WHAT
WE ARE RAISING MONEY FOR)</b></p>
<ul>
<li>We need $5K
     for materials to make our plastic based rooftop, buy some solar PV panels
     and place all of that on a rooftop. 
     </li>
<li>What you get
     is the first ever satisfaction of making solar affordable for
     everyone.  For the price of a normal
     asphalt shingle roof that lasts 15years, we can add a roof that lasts 50
     and has solar.  That is our goal.</li>
<li>For a
     donation of $30 we will send you a fantastic t-shirt that says you are a
     supporter of solar.  </li>
<li>For a $200
     donation we will get you your own demo of the plastic roof.</li>
</ul><p><b>THE IMPACT</b></p>
<p>Electrical Energy Prices are increasing due to higher
demand and less supply.  The US
Residential households often pay the highest rates with averages running above
11 cents per KWH.  US residents consumed
over 154,698 million KWH in 2012.  The
price and market for residential power is over 17 Billion in the residential
market.  Prices constantly get higher
and higher based on demand.  Forecasts
for Power Demand put US residential power at Double the KWH currently demanded
by 2025.</p>

of my career in the Energy industry, specifically in Nuclear, I have witnessed
first-hand the dynamic and dramatic shifts in the landscape for power
generation.  My time with GE in the Power
& Water business has seen the rise, fall, rise, and then fall of the
Nuclear Renaissance, the rapid emergence and then downtown in Wind, and the recent
explosion in gas turbines.  During that
time I have been working with our Nuclear Services business delivering projects
to major Utility customers across the US and in Asia, while also directing
internal projects for technology development following GE’s New Product
Introduction program.  I worked in
mechanical design after graduating with my BSME from NC State, and hope to
continue working around emerging technology in the Energy industry once I
complete my MBA from Fuqua in 2013.  I
see this area of solar energy as an exciting field with vast growth potential
if the right product is brought to market.
Charlie Wright: I am a WEMBA 2013 candidate with seven years
of experience in the consumer products and goods industry working for Newell
Rubbermaid.  I have worked in a variety
of supply chain roles and spent the last five years sourcing plastic and metal
components and finished goods across the globe. 
Prior to my work at Newell Rubbermaid, I spent 18 months founding a
microfinance company in Peru. I have an strong interest in solar energy
solutions and look forward to growing this company.

CROWDFUNDING NEEDS (WHAT
WE ARE RAISING MONEY FOR)

We need $5K
     for materials to make our plastic based rooftop, buy some solar PV panels
     and place all of that on a rooftop. 
     
What you get
     is the first ever satisfaction of making solar affordable for
     everyone.  For the price of a normal
     asphalt shingle roof that lasts 15years, we can add a roof that lasts 50
     and has solar.  That is our goal.
For a
     donation of $30 we will send you a fantastic t-shirt that says you are a
     supporter of solar.  
For a $200
     donation we will get you your own demo of the plastic roof.
THE IMPACT
Electrical Energy Prices are increasing due to higher
demand and less supply.  The US
Residential households often pay the highest rates with averages running above
11 cents per KWH.  US residents consumed
over 154,698 million KWH in 2012.  The
price and market for residential power is over 17 Billion in the residential
market.  Prices constantly get higher
and higher based on demand.  Forecasts
for Power Demand put US residential power at Double the KWH currently demanded
by 2025.

<p><strong>Last year</strong>, we ran a successful <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/New-Tools-for-Rain-Forest-Conservation?a=138166"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">campaign</a> here on Indiegogo. Our goal: conserve wild palm trees that provide high-quality nutrition to people in South American rain forests.</p>
<p>From Venezuela to Bolivia people are cutting down wild palms to take their fruit. This degrades both the forest and the diets of local people. We make common cause with those locals who support sustainable palm fruit harvests.</p>
<p>Having worked in backwater areas to test our approach, we are ready to take the project to the big leagues: <strong>IQUITOS, PERU</strong>. Its half-a-million people survive in large part by consuming from the bounty of the surrounding rain forest--including palm fruits.</p>
<p>To conserve wild palm trees, people can harvest their fruit by climbing for it, so that the trees can fruit again. This was the traditional way. How do we know? At our first workshop and competition, in 2002, older climbers bested younger climbers. They had the technique down, while the youngsters were not in climbing shape, and lacked technique-they were more experienced with using axes or machetes to cut palms down.</p>
<p>Last year, you gave, we bought equipment and supplies, made the climbing gear, took it to Venezuela, and held the <a href=""http://caura.org/news/new-level-competition-and-skill-4th-palm-climbing-event"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">event</a>. Over 90 palm climbers participated and it was the most successful event yet. After 4 events over 10 years, young people have learned the technique—they are the top climbers now. This will translate into greater conservation of wild palms in rain forests.</p>
<p><strong>Now: the next step</strong></p>
<p>We are ready for Iquitos. And we have a special member of the team lined up: Italo Mesones, native Amazonian renaissance man. Italo knows the small communities in the forests around Iquitos. He knows where the fruit is harvested, knows where palms are being felled to collect their fruit to feed the big market in Iquitos. He navigates city and jungle equally well.</p>
<p>Italo’s skills and knowledge are key to making our event in Iquitos a success. We have the manufacturing equipment many of you funded last year. So that gives us a big leg up. <strong>What we need to do in the next 6 months is train two dozen instructors for a huge workshop and competition in mid-2013. So, we need to get busy making gear, and we need Italo out in the field organizing.</strong></p>

<p>Lionfish are becoming a monumental problem in the Gulf
of Mexico, Atlantic and the Caribbean. They are consuming massive quantities of
juvenile commercial fish and seafood such as grouper, snapper, shrimp, octopus,
lobsters and many reef fish.  NOAA has
said that this invasive species will have the largest impact on the Atlantic
and Caribbean reefs in the last century, much greater than pollution and
development. The links below are from leading scientific organizations and
media and they depict very dire consequences if Lionfish cannot be controlled.
A single Lionfish female can produce over 300,000 eggs per year and they have
no natural predators! They can consume prey that are more than half of their
own length. They have also been documented to decrease native fish populations
by 79% in 5 weeks by a single lionfish. 
Lionfish have 17 venomous spines that can cause extreme pain and
swelling. They have been seen as deep as 300 feet and as shallow as 5 feet.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that culling, which is killing
Lionfish in designated areas such as reefs, will work to control the
ever-expanding population. But without vastly increasing the number of divers
that are actively involved in hunting, control will not be attained. There must
be a change in weaponry. The military does not normally use single shot rifles
because it is not effective, nor will pole spears or standard spear guns be
very effective in the long run. </p>
<p>My name is Michael Price with Pollution Solutions. I
have been an avid diver and environmentalist for over 30 years. Last year, I
traveled to Belize and was appalled at the number of Lionfish I saw there.
After that trip we began work on new technology for Lionfish control.</p>

<h3><b>How will the money be used?</b></h3>
<p>Our intent is to bring The LAW from a 2nd generation
prototype to a manufactured on-the-shelf product. This will require engineering
to reduce costs and design parts, such as a handle and tube sealing. We will
also need testing of at least 5 beta units in affected areas to determine what
changes to implement. We will require liability insurance, packaging, legal
help, a website and money to purchase awards. The following are our cost
estimates:</p>
<p>Build up to 40 units as awards        $10,000 </p>
<p>Design work-handle and trigger      $10,000 </p>
<p>Travel for beta tests                             $8,000 </p>

Risks & Challenges
  Getting permission for use of this device, in all other affected countries may be a challenge, but because The LAW is designed for Lionfish spearing only, we believe it will succeed.  There are several people in those countries that will champion our cause.
Attaining broad acceptance by the dive industry will take time, but the beta testing program will add credibility to the device and its use.   Other Ways You Can Help If you are unable to contribute, please promote our Indiegogo campaign and Facebook page to your friends and family.

Michael Price, Inventor:  Michael has been an avid diver since 1976.  He dived many destinations from the Caribbean and South Pacific.  He has worked in the water industry for over 30 years and has a degree in chemistry and minored in marine biology.  His passion has always been for the environment and the wildlife that inhabits it.  He had two previous businesses involved in the environment and water and has received a patent for an air pollution control device.
Sheila Agahan-Price was the administrator at UCSD School of Medicine. Her management skills provide efficiency and oversight of the entire project of The LAW.  Her interest in Lionfish came from a trip with her husband, Michael, to Belize where she saw the damage being caused to the reefs inhabitants.
Anthony San Nicolas has a love for computers ever since he had to format his first Windows 3.1 computer.  He attended Platt College where he acquired his Associates Degree in Graphic Design.  He is the videographer and draft illustrator for the prototype of The LAW.  Anthony has become passionate about the Lionfish invasion and looks forward to further the cause of The LAW.
Kristi San Nicolas is a graduate of the Art Institute of
San Diego, California, with a Bachelors Degree in Graphic Design.  She has brought to our team her unique
creativity in the design logo for The LAW.
Fred Maki has 37 years of experience as a machinist, engineer, and programmer. He developed the prototype of The LAW in conjunction with Michael and will continue to manufacture the beta and pre-production series and possibly produce the finish product.

<p><strong>ENG</strong>: Pangolins are truly fascinating, unique animals. They have existed on earth for over 80 million years and yet they could disappear before most people even know they exist. There are eight species in total - four in Asia and four in Africa - and sadly all are threatened with extinction. Poached for their meat and scales, which are mainly destined for Asia, pangolins are considered the most trafficked mammals in the world. These 'scaly anteaters' regulate ant and termite populations, playing an important role in maintaining balance in the ecosystems they inhabit, yet we still have much more to learn about them.</p>

We want to assess the population of pangolins and which species are living in the surrounding concession area (640 km²), so that we can better protect them. The baseline information collected from this survey will be critical to informing our work, as it will help us monitor any changes in the pangolin populations over time. In order to conduct this study, our trackers need the right field equipment, such as shoes for trekking, raincoats, waterbottles and tents, so that they can work in good conditions. Also needed are proper tech equipment, things like GPS devices, walkie-talkies, a computer, an external hard drive, and writing materials so that we can collect, store and analyse data effectively. FR : Le Sangha Pangolin Project souhaite financer un nouveau projet de recherche scientifique afin de recenser la population de pangolins vivant dans la zone protégée autour de l'écolodge (640 km²). Pour pouvoir mener cette étude, nous avons besoin d'équipement tels des chaussures, des imperméables et des tentes pour que les pisteurs puissent travailler dans de bonnes conditions, ainsi que des GPS, un ordinateur, un disque dur externe, des talkie-walkies, du matériel pour prendre des notes, etc., afin que nous puissions collecter, stocker et étudier les données recueillies sur les pangolins. 
How will we use your donations?Comment seront utilisés vos dons ?
 ENG: Your donations will help us finance all the equipment we need in order to conduct the survey. You can consult the listing of the equipment as well as pricing in the following chart:FR : Vos dons serviront à financer l’équipement nécessaire au recensement de la population de pangolin. Vous pouvez consulter la liste des équipements, ainsi que les prix dans le tableau suivant: 
What you getCe que vous recevez
ENG: Here’s a detailed chart on all perks available on this campaign. Please note that since our project is located in a remote part of the tropical forest, shipping is a challenge and also costly. As a result, most of our perks, such as the Ba'aka drawings, are digital and physical gifts can only be offered for the larger donations:FR : Voici un tableau détaillant les récompenses proposées pour cette campagne - veuillez noter que, compte tenu de notre localisation, au milieu de la forêt tropicale, l’envoi de récompenses est compliqué. En conséquence, quelques récompenses sont au format numérique, comme ces dessins faits par les Ba'aka, et les récompenses physiques ne sont proposées qu’à partir des paliers les plus importants : 
Other ways you can helpD'autres manières de nous soutenir
 ENG: First and foremost, you can support us by sharing this project with others in your network. This will help us reach a wider audience - people we might not otherwise access - which would make an enormous difference for us. Most people have never heard of pangolins, and we want to change that. So, even the simple act of talking about pangolins with your friends and family, especially you've learned through our campaign, would have a positive impact. Small ripples can change the tide! FR : En premier lieu, vous pouvez nous soutenir en partageant ce projet avec votre réseau. En partageant notre projet, vous nous aidez à atteindre une audience à laquelle nous n'aurions pas accès autrement. Cela fait toute la différence pour nous !Vous pouvez également parler des pangolins à vos amis et à votre famille, pour nous aider à faire connaître cet animal. Une grande partie de la population mondiale n'a simplement jamais entendu parler des pangolins et nous voulons changer ça. Plus ils seront connus, et plus nous serons capable de les sauver.

<p>In
sub-Saharan Africa, it is estimated that <b>70%
</b>of the population does not have access to reliable grid power (UN
2013).  This means that in many cases the
doors to learning, healthcare, business and agriculture are closed, resulting
in economic hardship and dependence on first world support.  In addition, the reliance on fossil fuels
becomes enormous, as fossil fuels are used for power generation, heating,
lighting and cooking.  Apart from the
environmental and health damage caused by the use of these fossil fuels, the
rising costs and lack of availability of these fuels further inhibit the
development of basic services and community self-reliance.  <b>Why
this reliance on fossil fuels in the part of the world that has the highest
average daily sunshine in the world?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>The Solution</b></p>
<p><b>The Greenerator Solar
Generators!  </b>These generators use the latest in
solar technology to capture that abundant sunshine, convert it to electricity,
store it in batteries and make it available as mains power via inverters.  The units are completely scalable meaning
that there will be the right sized solar generator for any application.  The Greenerator generators can be
semi-permanent, container based units or, for total flexibility, can be vehicle
or trailer based enabling access to even the darkest corners of Southern
Africa.  Whether you need to run
sensitive medical equipment for a mobile clinic, power a small business or
community, run a pump for water supply or irrigation or just need to keep your computer
server room running during power outages, the Greenerator solar generator is
your ideal partner.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>The Benefits</b></p>
<p>Due to the fact that the solar
generators are harnessing the sun’s energy, it is a completely clean and
environmentally friendly power source. 
Apart from the sun, there are no consumables, so having to source
expensive fuels in remote locations is a thing of the past. Greenerator solar generators can be mobile, vehicle mounted units or placed in a fixed location.</p>
<p>The Greenerator generators: </p>
<p>·<span>  </span>Have no moving parts, so maintenance

<h3>Send Shua to the Finger Lakes Permaculture Institute</h3>
<p>Hey there interwebs, Shua here. You might know me from my blog, <a href=""http://backyardbeddie.blogspot.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Poor Backyard Beddie's Almanac: Experiments in Low-Cost Suburban MicroFarming</a>, or from the farmer's market, or maybe we garden together or might in the future.</p>
<p>I've been offered a Work-Study at the <a href=""http://fingerlakespermaculture.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Finger Lakes Permaculture Institute</a> where, in exchange for helping with camp build-out and take-down, I can earn my Permaculture Design Certificate at a reduced cost.</p>
<p>I've been a student of permaculture for several years and have used what I've learned so far to help members of my community establish affordable, low-maintenance organic gardens.  The Work-Study will immerse me in permaculture, allow me to learn from more experienced teachers &amp; other students all while camping out in the midst of an established off-grid permaculture homestead.  </p>
<p>With your help I can travel up to New York state and learn valuable skills that I can bring back home.  I believe this experience will help me to crystallize that knowledge into a teachable form that I can offer to our community, thus furthering my quest to foster cooperative local food systems.</p>
<h3>What I Need To Get There</h3>
<p>I'd say that I'm dirt poor, but my soil's too rich. The life of an itinerant yard farmer isn't the most lucrative profession though so I need help to get there. The reduced tuition cost for the Permaculture Design Certificate course is $700, plus I'll need to get myself up to Ithaca, NY, feed myself for the 2 weeks before the course begins, arrange for someone to tend my garden &amp; lil flock of hens, and cover my rent and bills while I''m not earning income for a month.</p>
<p>If I reach my goal, I'll be golden for the trip.  If I exceed the goal, then I'll put the excess funds towards one of Backyard Beddie's upcoming projects: either a potting mix made entirely from renewable resources (no peat or vermiculite/perlite) or the solar-powered compost tea brewer. If I don't reach the goal, all the funds I do receive will go towards getting me up there, and I'll make it work somehow.</p>
<p>I don't expect something for nothing though, so I'm offering several perks for help from my local community (see <a href=""http://www.backyardbeddies.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.backyardbeddies.com</a> for my local radius map).</p>
<p>$25: An assortment of plants for your fall/winter garden. There will be a good mix of veggies, herbs &amp; perennial medicinals.</p>
<p>$75: An hour-long education session from my upcoming Gardening From Scratch curriculum: you can choose either <em>Understanding Microclimates to Help Your Garden Grow, Discovering Dirt: Soil-Stewardship &amp; No-Till Techniques, </em>or<em> Home-Scale Composting</em>.</p>
<p>$100: A site visit and a visioning session where we can address how to use the space in your yard to optimize the production of food, medicine &amp; habitat.</p>
<p>$200: when I return with my Permaculture Design Certificate, we'll get together and develop a design for your home to suit your needs. We'll create a master plan &amp; a project timeline and you'll get a 10% discount on any products or services I offer: plants, compost/mulch delivery, installation, etc.</p>

For me, yoga is mindful engagement with myself and others, it is a practice that connects me to my innate wisdom. Following my dreams to live my yoga practice at a yoga institute has given me the courage to undertake an epic adventure to challenge and expand myself. April through October 2014, I will hike the entire Appalachian Trail!</p><p>Why would I want to hike 2,186 miles through 14 states? </p><p>To see if I can! I am doing this because it's what my intuition is telling me to do. Yoga has taught me that the more deeply I see myself, the more deeply I see the world. Hiking the Appalachian Trail is a meditation to expand and empower myself. I am a spiritual seeker. I long to take my practice deep into the forests and learn from nature as yogis have done for thousands of years. </p><p>This is my dream. My (one way!) plane ticket to the southern start of the trail in Georgia is purchased. I am doing this. However I won't be able to finish without support. </p><p><b>I need your help</b></p><p>Although the hike is a long walk in the woods, it takes money.<br/>Through Hikers (people who hike the whole trail at one time) spend between $5,000-$8,000 on gear, food, and town visits. <br/></p><p>I have saved up by teaching over 1,500 yoga classes but not<br/>enough to make this dream come true.</p><p>Your donations will help pay for supplies, food, hostels and other<br/>essentials that wilderness travel requires. The average hiker wears through 3 pairs of boots!<br/></p><p><b>Perks of Donating to my trail-</b></p><p>For $10: I will write you a post card while on the trail</p><p>For $25: I will send you a personalized letter and photo from<br/>the trail.</p><p>For $50: I will send you a transcription of part my trail journal<br/>after I've completed the hike.</p><p>For $75:  Reiki is the ancient Japanese healing technique of channeling energy for emotional and physical well being.

For me, yoga is mindful engagement with myself and others, it is a practice that connects me to my innate wisdom. Following my dreams to live my yoga practice at a yoga institute has given me the courage to undertake an epic adventure to challenge and expand myself. April through October 2014, I will hike the entire Appalachian Trail!Why would I want to hike 2,186 miles through 14 states? To see if I can! I am doing this because it's what my intuition is telling me to do. Yoga has taught me that the more deeply I see myself, the more deeply I see the world. Hiking the Appalachian Trail is a meditation to expand and empower myself. I am a spiritual seeker. I long to take my practice deep into the forests and learn from nature as yogis have done for thousands of years. This is my dream. My (one way!) plane ticket to the southern start of the trail in Georgia is purchased. I am doing this. However I won't be able to finish without support. I need your helpAlthough the hike is a long walk in the woods, it takes money.Through Hikers (people who hike the whole trail at one time) spend between $5,000-$8,000 on gear, food, and town visits. I have saved up by teaching over 1,500 yoga classes but notenough to make this dream come true.Your donations will help pay for supplies, food, hostels and otheressentials that wilderness travel requires. The average hiker wears through 3 pairs of boots!Perks of Donating to my trail-For $10: I will write you a post card while on the trailFor $25: I will send you a personalized letter and photo fromthe trail.For $50: I will send you a transcription of part my trail journalafter I've completed the hike.For $75:  Reiki is the ancient Japanese healing technique of channeling energy for emotional and physical well being. This practice can be done from any distance. I am a certified level two Reiki practitioner, soon to be Reiki Master (getting my final attunement March 6th) with 3 years of experience.

Each logo you see represents a company that has sponsored us, or an organization that shares our willingness to collaborate on solutions. We focused on Project Drawdown this year because of their powerful body of work that leads the way to genuine hope at a time when we need it most.And, I took on the role of producing an event for Drawdown at COP23, that opened new eyes – organizational eyes – to the many solutions we have available.OUR BACKSTORY...The iGiveTrees campaign has been supported by global citizens spanning 5 continents since 2009. We are responsible for 6,000 trees being planted at a size, and in a manner, that is conducive to their growth, rather than just being statistics that die off within months due to lack of care. We have respected the dignity, wisdom and value of every person involved in the process, from seed harvesters, to nurserymen, to organizational partners, to subsistence farmers. In 2016, iGiveTrees was recognized as one of “100 Projects for the Climate” by the French Ministry of the Environment, and was invited to participate in the climate change conference, COP22. Since then we have been scaling our future reach with support from the French organization, OpenTeam.In 2017, when the research of Project Drawdown was released, I discovered that we were already engaged with 3 of the Top 15 solutions to global warming.To increase our capacity to plant native species tropical staple tree crops in 2018, we are collaborating with a Brazilian agroforestry training center to help a new generation of environmental entrepreneurs learn how to effectively plant urban food forests in the city of São Paulo.  Your support allows us to continue planting and maintaining native species trees organically, while supporting local communities. The trees we gift back to the Earth are maintained by local people for two years, to insure their survival in the field.My name is Alana Lea, creator of the iGiveTrees project. Through trial and error, over the last eight years, we've discovered a way to restore real hope. With your funding partership, I've been able to give trees to small Brazilian communities through their local NGOs. In turn, they are improving the soil, replanting an endangered rainforest to restore biodiversity, produce more oxygen, rebalance water systems,  and sink more carbon for the benefit of the whole planet.  These days, I'm confident that we've made a positive impact by directly supporting small local, organic, rural organizations, instead of the Big International NGOs (BINGOs) that accept funding from agrochemical companies, then teach people to use toxic chemicals to keep their donors happy. These BINGOs also fund environmental education, while requiring the use of herbicides when their projects replant the forest. Nature's balance is once again being destroyed, by those methods.Small local NGOs are in the ideal position to distribute saplings to farmers who want to revitalize land and water, without being obligated to apply herbicides to the new forests, by benefactors who accept funding from multinational agrochemical companies.
Since 2009 the iGiveTrees campaign has crowdfunded 6,000 trees that were given to the people of the Atlantic Rainforest just by sharing our story on a few blogs and videos. That was R&D - research and development - to discover what works. And even more important, what doesn't work. Informed by experience, we're now motivated to do hundreds of times more with new field partners who have proven commitment to the process, while needing help to achieve their planting goals.
 
Most of the trees we've given back to the Atlantic Forest since 2010 have been planted in  the Vale do Paraiba, São Paulo state. Have a look at this historic photo to see the area, as it appeared in the 1882. We see slaves working in a coffee plantation. Descendants of some of these people are now subsistence farm families,  receiving trees to heal the spirit of both people and the land, while renewing their water sources.

 
 
Here's how the project began...

 When I learned that 93% of the Brazilian rainforest where I was born had disappeared in my lifetime, I was shocked into action. So I found people who knew more about the land than I did, and together we started a reforestation project. 

 

Over several years, I teamed up with a network of sustainable seed harvesters, small NGOs and subsistence farm families who now live on barren land that was once a lush rainforest. They want to replant their land, without adding toxic chemicals to their groundwater, as they're being taught to do by certain entities.
  In some of the areas we've helped plant in the past years, residents are challenged by the eucalyptus plantations (for paper pulp) that work with agrochemical companies, and their green gloved NGO partners who approve of planting genetically engineered trees, sprayed with toxic herbicides. 
 

 
Once abundant water sources were sucked dry by thirsty, fast-growing, eucalyptus trees, contributing to epic droughts, while pollinators die, and remaining water supplies are contaminated by glyphosate, now recognized as a carcinogen by the World Health Organization.


By contrast, when we give rural families a gift of organically grown, native species trees, they renew the life of the rainforest to benefit us all.



Together, we are renewing the planet's precious natural resources for our kids.
 And, we're proud of our results! Most tree planting projects are planting seedlings in fields then walking away, hoping they'll grow without further care. Unfortunately, quite often the baby trees die from lack of water, being overgrown by grasses or trampling within months, while the planting project claims BIG NUMBERS of the trees they planted. Not us.
Have a look at just a few pictures of two year growth reports for trees planted through our project in 2011. OUR TREES GROW!!!
 
 
Since our beginning, the project has attracted a global community of supporters: Michael Bernard Beckwith (featured in ""The Secret"" and founder of Agape International Spiritual Center), Rickie Byars Beckwith (founder of the Agape International Choir), Caroline MacDougall (Teecino founder), DC Cordova (CEO of Money and You), Deborah Koff-Chapin (founder of the Touch Drawing Center), Katherine Woodward Thomas (author of ""Calling in The One"" and ""Conscious Uncoupling""), Marie Diamond (featured in ""The Secret""), Martin Dunkerton (author of ""Awakening Your Riches""), Ryan Eliason (creator of the Social Entrepreneur Empowerment series), George Kao (creator of the Enlightened Business Bootcamp), Steve Bhaerman (a.k.a. Swami Beyondananda, co-author of ""Spontaneous Evolution: Our Positive Future""), Vicki Robin (author of ""Your Money or Your Life""), Natalie Ledwell (co-creator of Mind Movies), Sylvie Rokab (director of ""Love Thy Nature"") Daniel Nahmod (of Humanity Music Co.) and Nimo (Empty Hands Music), Nutiva, Dr. Bronner's and the French Ministry of the Environment, Energy and the Sea  are among them. 
NOW we invite YOU to join us...  Our reforestation project supports global cooling, the return of wildlife and Nature's biodiversity. And our hundreds of species of tropical trees have a better chance of growing to maturity, faster, able to sink more carbon than trees planted in the backyards of the Northern Hemisphere OR Genetically Modified trees. 
Your non-tax-deductible ""crowdfunding"" donations here on Indiegogo make the purchase and distribution of these trees possible, at no cost to the recipients, through social enterprise and non-profit partnerships. If you'd prefer to make a US tax-deductible contribution, please do so through our fiscal sponsor. We work directly with small, local NGO partners in the community who are focused on teaching organic agroforestry methods in targeted areas of need. 
  

 
Our new goal is to start an urban landscaping service in the city of São Paulo, planting small food forests, using the proven models of Afforestt, to help sustain tree donations to subsistence farm families. 



Native species trees replanted in Brazil benefit the entire planet.

<h2><strong>What is our campaign about?</strong></h2>
<h2><strong><em>We biologically treat the residue of olive oil pressing, a serious environmental hazard, turning it into 100% natural, safe, cleaning products.</em></strong></h2>
<p>Many of the olive growing countries focus on olive farming due to the fact that olive trees are drought resistant. Unfortunately bulks of olive residue are being dumped down the creeks, harming their own, extremely limited, drinking water reservoirs.</p>
<p>In a whole different field, the world creates house hold cleaning products, using precious drinking water and loads of poisonous chemicals. Last year alone <strong>1.4 million Americans were hospitalized as a result of house hold cleaning products injuries</strong>, out of them 800.000 were children younger than 6 years old. As a result of using chemical loaded houshold cleaning products each one of us, in average, holds in his body 250 poisonous chemicals, out of which 50 are suspected as potential to cause cancer. </p>
<p>After we sustainably and organically press the olive oil, we collect the olives' residue; this is most of the olive, and overwhelmed with antioxidant. Thus, when spilled in the environment it pollutes the water table and sterilizes the soil. <strong>We biologically treat the residue</strong> and turn it first into olive vinegar. This is a brand-new and patented process. We then add plant extracts and essentials, <strong>turning it into 100% natural, safe, chemical free house hold cleaning products.</strong></p>

<p>My name is Sarah Peck and I am the founder of Mother Nature’s Army. <br/> Mother Nature’s Army’s goal is to deepen awareness surrounding the importance of green living by implementing responsible behaviors into everyday life.</p>
<p>A few friends and I are going to drive across country as Mother Nature’s Army and clean up America, while educating and raising awareness on the importance of going green and recycling!!</p>
<p>We have found a school bus that has been converted to run on vegetable oil. <br/> We are going to drive from Upstate NY to California and back within 2 months time. We will leave the 3<sup>rd</sup> week in October 2012 and come back at the end of December 2012.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><em>The Impact</em></strong></p>
<p>Our goals (based on having 4-6 people present on the bus):</p>
<ul>
<li>· Pick up 1 bag of trash a day per person, with a goal of 350 trash bags</li>
<li>· Recycle 20 items per person a day with a goal of recycling over 7,000 items</li>
<li>· Upcycle 1 item per day per person with a goal of upcycling over 300 items</li>
<li>· To reach out to as many people as we can and have them take the knowledge we share and make greener decisions everyday.</li>
</ul>
<p>Items we cannot recycle or upcycle will go in our Free Cycle Box. It will be outside our bus when we’re stopped for anyone to take from.</p>
<p>(Upcycling is the process of converting waste materials or useless products into new materials or products of better quality or a higher environmental value.)</p>
<p>We are also planning on being a zero-waste bus.</p>
<p>We will have a power point presentation wherever we go to educate people. We will set up a sheet on the side of the bus with a small projector.

My name is Sarah Peck and I am the founder of Mother Nature’s Army.  Mother Nature’s Army’s goal is to deepen awareness surrounding the importance of green living by implementing responsible behaviors into everyday life.
A few friends and I are going to drive across country as Mother Nature’s Army and clean up America, while educating and raising awareness on the importance of going green and recycling!!
We have found a school bus that has been converted to run on vegetable oil.  We are going to drive from Upstate NY to California and back within 2 months time. We will leave the 3rd week in October 2012 and come back at the end of December 2012.
 
The Impact
Our goals (based on having 4-6 people present on the bus):

· Pick up 1 bag of trash a day per person, with a goal of 350 trash bags
· Recycle 20 items per person a day with a goal of recycling over 7,000 items
· Upcycle 1 item per day per person with a goal of upcycling over 300 items
· To reach out to as many people as we can and have them take the knowledge we share and make greener decisions everyday.

Items we cannot recycle or upcycle will go in our Free Cycle Box. It will be outside our bus when we’re stopped for anyone to take from.
(Upcycling is the process of converting waste materials or useless products into new materials or products of better quality or a higher environmental value.)
We are also planning on being a zero-waste bus.
We will have a power point presentation wherever we go to educate people. We will set up a sheet on the side of the bus with a small projector. We are going to show this presentation almost every day even if there is only 1 person present to watch.  The power point will be teach people about our veggie bus, how it works and why its better for the environment then gas. We will talk about how to go about switching your car over. We will discuss our trip, what we plan to achieve, what we have already achieved, what zero-waste means, how to go about becoming a zero-waste household,  how to recycle and the impact it actually makes on the environment.

</p><p>I need your help. I have just embarked on the journey of a lifetime, a plastic pollution expedition through the
Atlantic Ocean from Bermuda to Iceland. I have volunteered my time to work as
part of the 5 Gyres.org team to help bring understanding and solutions to one
of our planet’s biggest challenges. PLASTIC! I have documented my discoveries with photos and video. An example, did you know that 500 million straws are thrown away every day in the
US alone. Much of our plastic unfortunately does not get recycled. What are the
impacts on our oceans and in turn...us? I want to help raise awareness, help change policy and inspire people to use less. I will show you what I have discovered.</p>

Please help me undertake this challenge!! <p></p><p>The ocean plays an integral role on sustaining life on earth, protecting this important resource is vital. Humans produce 100% of the plastic pollution in our oceans. Hundreds of millions of metric tons of plastic debris currently float in the ocean. In 2012, 288 million tons of new plastics were created which tells us that recycling is not enough. The plastic breaks down into small pieces, (micro plastics) scattered throughout the water. This impacts our oceans, marine life and in turn, us.  We need to be able to show the impacts of plastic in our oceans to create change.  To help people understand why this is dangerous both for our eco-system and us and what changes we can make by refusing single-use plastics like plastic bags and water bottles, getting government officials involved to create policy and making industry look for new sustainable ideas. We took 31 surface trawls while at sea and found plastic in all of them. This scientific data we are out at sea collecting is invaluable. The first step to solutions is public awareness and engagement and that's where I come in and why this voyage is so important to me.  So many people don't even know how urgent our plastic pollution problem is.  Maybe as you read this you are just  now learning as well. Let's be part of the solution!!!</p><h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Summary</span></h3><p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-family: Arial;"">My name is Tiffany Paige and I have been selected to team up with the verified non-profit 5 Gyres Institute (<a href=""http://www.5gyres.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color: rgb(14, 180, 182) !important; text-decoration: none !important;"">www.5gyres.org</a>) for their Viking Gyre Expedition, a plastic pollution research expedition from Bermuda to Iceland.<span style="""">  </span>There will be 14 of us on board.<span style="""">  </span>We will be at sea on a 72-foot sailing vessel named the <i style="""">Sea Dragon</i> for 20 days, covering 2500 miles in total, to understand microplastic distribution and </span><span style=""font-family: Arial;"">impacts from the subtropical gyre across the subpolar gyre.  This research helps determine the global estimate and impact of plastic pollution in our oceans as well as help change policy.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/588327/files/20140518191345-5_gyres_collage.jpg?1400465625"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-family: Arial;""><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Arial, sans-serif;""><span style=""font-family: Arial;"">Plastic creates toxic pollution at every stage of its existence: manufacture, use, and disposal.

There were hi's and low's and special friendships made. Most of all there was plastic. Lots of plastic.  Not as much big plastic ,although there was, but it was mostly little plastic pieces which is much more dangerous. Think about what happens if every big piece of plastic breaks down into hundreds of thousands of little pieces of plastic yet never goes away.  That's what is happening.</span></p><h3>

</h3><p>
</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-family: Arial;""></span></p><p>Ideally I would like to raise $12,000 to cover my costs associated with joining the 5 Gyres expedition.  It is an expensive trip and more money than I've spent on any trip ever, but well worth it. I'm asking for $4,500. I'd rather make my goal than not and if I go over than it only helps my cause. I have chosen to run this Indiegogo campaign as a ""flexible funding"" campaign, so please know that any contribution will be graciously accepted. In other words, my hope is to go over the $4500 for a $12,000 target, I will be accepting all donations made to help pay for the trip.</p><p></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-family: Arial;""></span></p><p>My costs break down as follows:  </p><p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><font>$8,500 berth - The largest

amount charters the boat for 20 days, with a captain and 1st mate, fuel, food, gear and research.  I took out a revolving credit line for 3 months at my bank to pay for my seat in cash/check.</font></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-family: Arial;"">$1,500 for airfare to

<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-family: Arial;"">$500 - Hotels for 3 days in
Bermuda before boarding vessel and 3 days after landing in Iceland for beach
studies and surveys and any delays due to weather. Hotels are expensive in both Bermuda &amp; Iceland, so we stayed at the BIOS (Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences) and Kex Hostel in Iceland.</span><span style=""font-family: Arial;""> </span><span style=""font-family: Arial;"">Paid by credit card</span></p>

only been on a day-boat.<span style="""">  </span>I need
everything for the trip from a waterproof back-pack and duffle to proper boots,

</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-family: Arial;""><b>WHAT IS A GYRE, YOU ASK?</b></span></p><p></p><p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: 10.0pt;""><span style=""font-family: Arial;"">• A gyre in oceanography is a naturally
occurring vortex of wind and currents that rotate in a clockwise direction in
the northern hemisphere and counter-clockwise in the southern hemisphere. These
create a whirlpool effect, whose vortex moves more slowly at the center and
that is where marine plastic debris collects.</span></p><p></p><p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: 10.0pt;""><span style=""font-family: Arial;"">• There are 5 major gyres (hence the name of
the non-profit) in the oceans worldwide: 1.North Pacific, also known as the
North Pacific Garbage Patch (said to be twice the size of Texas); 2.South
Pacific; 3.North Atlantic; 4.South Atlantic; and 5.Indian Ocean.</span></p><p></p><p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""font-family: Arial;"">Discarded plastics have formed <span style="""">a toxic “plastic soup”</span> that is
gathering in the 5 massive ocean gyres around the world. As the plastic breaks
down, it is eaten by sea animals, causing illness and death. It eventually
enters our diets, too.</span></p>

I have just embarked on the journey of a lifetime, a plastic pollution expedition through the
Atlantic Ocean from Bermuda to Iceland. I have volunteered my time to work as
part of the 5 Gyres.org team to help bring understanding and solutions to one
of our planet’s biggest challenges. PLASTIC! I have documented my discoveries with photos and video. An example, did you know that 500 million straws are thrown away every day in the
US alone. Much of our plastic unfortunately does not get recycled. What are the
impacts on our oceans and in turn...us? I want to help raise awareness, help change policy and inspire people to use less. I will show you what I have discovered.

Please help me undertake this challenge!! The ocean plays an integral role on sustaining life on earth, protecting this important resource is vital. Humans produce 100% of the plastic pollution in our oceans. Hundreds of millions of metric tons of plastic debris currently float in the ocean. In 2012, 288 million tons of new plastics were created which tells us that recycling is not enough. The plastic breaks down into small pieces, (micro plastics) scattered throughout the water. This impacts our oceans, marine life and in turn, us.  We need to be able to show the impacts of plastic in our oceans to create change.  To help people understand why this is dangerous both for our eco-system and us and what changes we can make by refusing single-use plastics like plastic bags and water bottles, getting government officials involved to create policy and making industry look for new sustainable ideas. We took 31 surface trawls while at sea and found plastic in all of them. This scientific data we are out at sea collecting is invaluable. The first step to solutions is public awareness and engagement and that's where I come in and why this voyage is so important to me.  So many people don't even know how urgent our plastic pollution problem is.  Maybe as you read this you are just  now learning as well. Let's be part of the solution!!!SummaryMy name is Tiffany Paige and I have been selected to team up with the verified non-profit 5 Gyres Institute (www.5gyres.org) for their Viking Gyre Expedition, a plastic pollution research expedition from Bermuda to Iceland.  There will be 14 of us on board.  We will be at sea on a 72-foot sailing vessel named the Sea Dragon for 20 days, covering 2500 miles in total, to understand microplastic distribution and impacts from the subtropical gyre across the subpolar gyre.  This research helps determine the global estimate and impact of plastic pollution in our oceans as well as help change policy.Plastic creates toxic pollution at every stage of its existence: manufacture, use, and disposal. Plastic is a material that the Earth cannot digest. Every bit of plastic that has ever been created still exists, including the small amount that has been incinerated and has become toxic particulate matter. As you can see from the dates listed above I am back. I just got back having spent some time in Iceland doing research on their beaches.  What an incredible trip with many firsts for me.  I have taken lots of photos and videos to share (check out the gallery). There were hi's and low's and special friendships made. Most of all there was plastic. Lots of plastic.  Not as much big plastic ,although there was, but it was mostly little plastic pieces which is much more dangerous. Think about what happens if every big piece of plastic breaks down into hundreds of thousands of little pieces of plastic yet never goes away.  That's what is happening.
What is Needed and Where Your Support Goes

Ideally I would like to raise $12,000 to cover my costs associated with joining the 5 Gyres expedition.  It is an expensive trip and more money than I've spent on any trip ever, but well worth it. I'm asking for $4,500. I'd rather make my goal than not and if I go over than it only helps my cause. I have chosen to run this Indiegogo campaign as a ""flexible funding"" campaign, so please know that any contribution will be graciously accepted. In other words, my hope is to go over the $4500 for a $12,000 target, I will be accepting all donations made to help pay for the trip.My costs break down as follows:  
$8,500 berth - The largest
portion needed is for my seat on the Sea
Dragon sailing vessel.  This
amount charters the boat for 20 days, with a captain and 1st mate, fuel, food, gear and research.  I took out a revolving credit line for 3 months at my bank to pay for my seat in cash/check.
$1,500 for airfare to
Bermuda and from Iceland, home. Paid by credit card
$300 flight & travel
insurance. Paid by credit card
$500 - Hotels for 3 days in
Bermuda before boarding vessel and 3 days after landing in Iceland for beach
studies and surveys and any delays due to weather. Hotels are expensive in both Bermuda & Iceland, so we stayed at the BIOS (Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences) and Kex Hostel in Iceland. Paid by credit card
$850 for proper gear - I
don’t have any of the proper gear needed to be at sea for 12 days on a 72-ft
boat (this ain’t glamping!)  I have
only been on a day-boat.  I need
everything for the trip from a waterproof back-pack and duffle to proper boots,
work gloves and waterproof/repellent windbraker and layers of wool under-layers. I'd like to thank Helly Hansen for the generous discount to help pay for my gear. Paid by credit card.Let's just say I'm in credit card debt, but I still know it was the right thing to do.
Any extra made would help
with Indiegogo expenses and anything unforeseen that I have missed as well as well as to start the next phase, which is taking what I have seen and learned to help raise awareness and
help create changes in policy.
The Details
WHAT IS A GYRE, YOU ASK?
• A gyre in oceanography is a naturally
occurring vortex of wind and currents that rotate in a clockwise direction in
the northern hemisphere and counter-clockwise in the southern hemisphere. These
create a whirlpool effect, whose vortex moves more slowly at the center and
that is where marine plastic debris collects.
• There are 5 major gyres (hence the name of
the non-profit) in the oceans worldwide: 1.North Pacific, also known as the
North Pacific Garbage Patch (said to be twice the size of Texas); 2.South
Pacific; 3.North Atlantic; 4.South Atlantic; and 5.Indian Ocean.
Discarded plastics have formed a toxic “plastic soup” that is
gathering in the 5 massive ocean gyres around the world. As the plastic breaks
down, it is eaten by sea animals, causing illness and death. It eventually
enters our diets, too.
WHO AM I?I am an actress and host who
is passionate about the health and wellness of us and our environment.  I have decided to focus all my energy on
this. Since I was a little girl, EVERYTHING had feelings to me, from plants to
snails to real animals and stuffed, right down to an M&M.  What I really loved as a little girl is
our ocean. Growing up in Southern California, I grew up going to the beach on weekends.
I’d spend hours in the ocean. I feel a deep connection to it and everything in
it. A handful of years ago I heard about the Gyres. What? A garbage patch twice
the size of Texas? I have to see this, I thought. It can’t be!  Can you see it from above?  It was taking off from the LAX airport
and looking out the window down at the beautiful Pacific ocean glistening from
above, but wondering what lies beneath that prompted me to create a “green”
blog and online series of videos. “GreenWithTiffany” (www.greenwithtiffany.com) is a
social media connected site about all things “green” to raise awareness and bring
truth to the green movement by sharing ideas of sustainability, wellness,
environmental impacts and living as one with our planet and why it is
important.  From products and
services, to how-to’s and environmental challenges.  I want to share and highlight people who want to make a
difference. I learn as I go as well and want to share my findings to make sure
we move towards a more sustainable way of living, so that our beautiful Mother
Earth can thrive and so can we. 
My goal is to bring
awareness and light to plastic pollution and how it is affecting us and the
world we live in.  I want people to
be informed and  “choose to care”.  It is a serious situation that is
wreaking havoc on our environment. 
There are many people out there that just don’t know.  Maybe they recycle and they think that’s
enough.  Sadly, it’s not.  I will be documenting the entire trip.  I am going geared-up with a gaggle of
technology, from my phone to a GoPro, traditional video and point-and-shoot.  I will not miss capturing a second of
this trip.  I will post videos and
write blogs throughout.  Most of
all I will see firsthand and show people that our oceans are in trouble and we
need to act now.  I will continue
the conversation and educate when I get back, including making a short film to
document our discoveries a little deeper (pun intended).
5 Gyres is a non-profit that
conducts research and communicates about the global impact of plastic pollution
in the world’s oceans and employs strategies to eliminate the accumulation of
plastic pollution in the 5 subtropical gyres.  They have been on numerous panels such as SXSW Eco, CNN
during the search for the missing Malaysian airline flight 370, and in the
documentary Trashed, to name a few. To understand the impact of plastic
pollution they study the 5 subtropical gyres by sailing through them (www.5gyres.org). 
The 5 Gyres model is to
engage citizens in a global movement working to end the flow of plastics into
our shared oceans.  The 5 Gyres
team will take our crew to witness firsthand how plastics are impacting the
marine environment.SCIENTIFIC WORK
It
is the intention of 5 Gyres staff to have us participate in every aspect of the scientific
work on the expedition. This means that we’ll be hauling trawls, filling in
data sheets, picking plastic and fish out of the net, cleaning gear, etc....
Their intent is to have us become comfortable with the equipment and protocols
so that we can do this on our own as a citizen scientist. 
Research Objectives 
What we will be doing:
-Beach Survey: At each port along our sailing route 5 Gyres staff, crew
and local volunteers will survey beaches for micro and macro plastics in order
to assess the impact of gyre plastic on local communities.
Exhibitions -
In each of the islands, we will create a temporary exhibit with debris found on
local shores, featuring actual samples from the voyage. 
-Manta and hi-speed trawls:
These
three nets sample the sea in different ways, measuring surface volume slowly,
surface abundance quickly, and multiple levels below the surface simultaneously.
The end result is a plethora of data like no other voyage in the past.
This will provide an expected 50-75 sea surface samples.
-Vertical distribution and trawling:
Little
is known about the vertical distribution of plastic marine pollution,
especially during
varied sea states. We’ll deploy a prototype trawl that collects 11 samples at
one time, hopefully showing variation in the depth of microplastics based on how
rough the seas are.
-Visual observations:
Since
we can’t catch the big stuff in our nets, we sit on deck while the manta trawl
is out and look for it. This creates a 4th size range of
macroplastic data to go
with our microplastic data.
-iGyre:
Using
data from all expedition trawls, we will recalibrate our current global model to
determine a new estimate of the total weight and particle count of plastic pollution
in the N. Atlantic. These data, along with other data from recent expeditions,
together will provide a new global estimate.
In
general, we will be expected to help steer the ship, raise and lower sails,
coil lines, clean the deck, and other duties prescribed by the skipper, first-mate
or our team leader. In addition to sailing work there will be chores to keep the
vessel clean and comfortable. These include cleaning the kitchen, galley, organizing
the forepeak, sweeping the floors or vacuuming the bilge. Yes, I will be
“swabbing the deck, matie!”
WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT?
The ocean is Earth’s life support- The ocean covers
71% of the earth’s surface
- 50 to 70 % of our oxygen
comes from the ocean. That’s more than all of the world’s rainforests combined.
- The ocean is the #1 source of protein
for more than a billion people.
- The ocean regulates our climate, absorbs
carbon dioxide, holds 97% of Earth’s water,
and supports the greatest abundance of life on our planet.- More than 60% of the world’s population lives on or near the coast.
- The ocean provides a livelihood,
recreation, beauty, wonder, and untapped scientific discovery, leading to new
medications, foods, and advanced technologies.
- Our oceans account for 71% of the planet,
but less than 2% of our oceans are protected. We have protections in
place for nearly 12% of all land (through areas like national parks).
Everyone, everywhere depends on a healthy
sea 
What we know…
- Plastics pollution
accumulate in oceanic gyres.
- Plastic pollution dominates
marine debris.
- Plastic degrades at sea and
breaks down into tiny microplastics.
- Plastics absorb and release
chemicals.
- Animals eat and entangle in
plastic pollution.
By most estimates, hundreds of millions of metric
tons of plastic debris currently float in the ocean.  The plastic is
fragmented into small pieces, scattered throughout the water column. There
are no visible islands of trash anywhere, but rather an “ocean soup” laced with
plastic.Disposable plastics are the main source of
plastic pollution
Consumption of disposable plastics—bags, bottles,
straws and so forth—has spiraled out of control. These items are used for
seconds, hours or days, but their remains last forever.Plastic recycling is not a sustainable
solution to the crisis
Most of our plastic waste is landfilled,
downcycled, incinerated or exported to other countries. Recycling of plastic is
costly and does not stem the production of virgin plastic product.
We consume BILLIONS of bags
and bottles per year in the US alone.
We currently recover only 5% of the plastics we
produce for recycling.  Roughly 50%
is buried in landfills, some is remade into durable goods, and much of it
remains “unaccounted for”, lost in the environment where it ultimately washes
out to sea.WHEN?
I am leaving in June.  We are at sea from June 7- June 29th.  I will be gone by the time this closes but will still be active in keeping up,
so anything you can do would be greatly appreciated!
The ocean plays an integral
role on sustaining life on earth, protecting this important resource is vital.  Please be a part of the solution and
help me go. 
PERKS…
The perks range from a
grateful thank you, to social media shout outs, photos, plastic pollution
solutions and more.
- First I will create a thank
you page on my website and list every backer’s name (with your approval of
course).
- If you would like a shout-out
in one of my short videos I produce, I will give you a warm thank you at the
beginning or open of my video and your own nameplate at the end.
- If you would like a shout-out
on one of my videos during the voyage, I will give you a warm thank you at the
beginning as well as place your name at the end.  
- An additional longer format
video being made will then have multiple names of backers to thank from the
voyage section.-An A-Mason glass drinking jar that will also fit your glass straw.  Both have the 5 Gyres logo etched in.- The digital look-book and
photo album will be this adventure through my eyes and findings along the way
of images depicting the reality of our oceans as they currently are, both good
and bad.
 - LifeFactory, www.lifefactory.com is a reusable glass
bottle wrapped in a silicone sleeve. 
It takes the place of a plastic water bottle, is BPA free and does not
leach chemicals. I really do love and use mine everyday. They have generously
donated to my campaign. Thank you LifeFactory!- The film screening is a
documentary called Plastic Paradise: The
Great Pacific Garbage Patch. It focuses on the North Pacific Gyre and how
plastic pollution is affecting our marine life, especially the albatross at
Midway Atoll. It took Angela Sun, a friend, 7 years to make this film and
covers many aspects of plastic. 
She is donating a screening of her award-winning film for my campaign.  It will be held in the Los Angeles area
with the date and time to be determined. A Q&A will include a panel of
experts in this field. - The ultimate “green” party
will be at a to-be-announced location in the Los Angeles area.  We will have music, food, drinks,
vendors and a whole lotta fun.  I
hope you can join us.
 - To be a Co-Host with me will
be a blast.  I cover many events in
the “green” world.  From The
Natural Products Expo to the Green Festivals and Eco Emmy’s.  You can accompany me to an event in Los
Angeles and put your banter and fun interview skills to work.  Barbara WaWa has retired, ya know… :) - The eco gift bag will be filled
with goodies from food, beauty, cleaning, health, and solutions to our plastic
pollution epidemic.  Good for you
& the environment.  It will
definitely not disappoint.  Stay
tuned for more information. Expect a LifeFactory
reusable bottle; a straw from Simply Straws, a glass straw helping to offset the 500 million plastic starws thrown away every day (www.simplystraws.com); cleaning products from Earth Friendly Products (www.ecos.com), products that I use personally
and trust. Thank you LifeFactory, Simply Straws and Earth Friendly Products! - Would you like your very own
video to promote your product or service on your website and / or YouTube
Channel, as well as on my website and YouTube channel?  If what you want to promote is
something that is good for the planet and for us, I would be thrilled to help
promote it.  We will come to you
and do a 3-5 minute video of an interview with you as we learn about your product
or service.  We will edit it and
include screen shots of your site graphics and music to create your own
promotional piece to use wherever you choose.  If you are not located in the greater LA area, travel
expenses will need to be provided for me and my camera operator.
 - If you are a business and
would like to help sponsor me, I would be over the moon.  I will use your logo/decal and gear
myself up like an IndyCar racer.  I

one owner, leaving the other owner with little recourse and generating very
harmful impacts on the shrinking urban canopies of many cities.
The Scharpers’s neighbor has recently filed an Appeal to
overturn the Ruling. A reversal of the Ruling would be devastating for mature,
healthy trees. But support of the Ruling at the Appeal level would create an even
stronger legal precedent for trees not only in Ontario, but also Canada
as a whole. The Scharpers have spent a substantial amount of their own
money in court fees. They are asking for help to defend this unprecedented
pro-Tree Ruling.
The Ruling is so important for trees in Ontario and Canada, and
will impact the future and health of Canadians for generations to come. Please help raise funds to pay for
the costs of defending the Ruling.

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1501691203/owgyrfe1bjpsb2cqybzu.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Four Season Foraging is a Minneapolis-based business founded by me, Maria Wesserle. I have been harvesting wild foods and medicines for about 13 years, and I love to share this skill with others! Since 2008 I have been regularly teaching wild edible and other nature-based workshops. This project is the manifestation of my desire to help other people develop meaningful and sustainable relationships with the non-human world.</p>
<p>Four Season Foraging connects people with the resources necessary to start harvesting and preparing wild foods and medicines. By recommending sources, <a href=""https://www.fourseasonforaging.com/blog/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">writing blog posts</a>, and offering classes, I will establish new foragers and inspire experienced ones. Currently, I update the blog weekly with information about identifying, harvesting, and preparing wild foods and medicines. I plan to organize two workshops monthly during the peak harvest season from May through October, and have a few available during the off-season as well. But I need your help to get started!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Extra Stretch Goal</h3>
<p>Thanks so much for all your support! I have reached my original goal of $650 <i>and</i> my original stretch goal of $800 in only one and a half days! Hot dang! I never imagined I would receive such an outpouring of support!</p>
<p>In light of this, I think it's important to list more concrete things I will spend the money on. At the present time, I have $860 in contributions. Minus the $43 in platform fees and the $29.70 in credit card fees, I have <u>$787.30 in actual funds</u> coming toward me. The money will be spent as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>$350 for general liability insurance, needed to teach public classes</li>
<li>$235 for reference books to enhance workshop curriculum </li>
<li>$150 for a printer to produce workshop materials</li>
<li>$25 for a tripod to improve plant identification videos</li>
<li>$20 for a battery pack to keep my phone charged while shooting video and taking photos for blog posts</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to blogging, I plan to produce short plant identification videos and make them free to stream. This way, even more people can get a taste of the Four Season Foraging workshop experience!</p>
<p><strong>And I have a new stretch goal of $1200! </strong></p>
<p>If you help me reach this goal, $60 will go toward platform fees and approximately $40 will go toward credit card fees, leaving me <u>$1100 in spendable funds.</u> In addition to the items listed above, the money will be used as follows:</p>
<ul><li>$320 for a wild edibles workshop scholarship fund</li></ul>
<p>At $20 a workshop, this will allow 16 people to attend my workshops for free! Scholarship funds will be reserved for people with low income, people of color, and indigenous people.</p>
<p>If I don't reach $1200, whatever additional money is raised will go toward the scholarship fund. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Budget- Goal met!</h3>
<p>As a small, community-based business, Four Season Foraging doesn't need much to kickoff. The goal is set at $650 to fulfill two main needs:</p>
<ul>
<li>$350 for general liability insurance, needed to teach public classes</li>
<li>$235 for reference books to enhance workshop curriculum </li>
</ul>
<p>General liability insurance is necessary to begin teaching classes. I've already received a quote, and $350 is the estimated amount for a year's worth of insurance. </p>
<p>Not all information sources are created equal; having books from trusted authors is essential to foraging! Books will be made available to students at workshops, and will help me fact-check when writing blog posts or teaching. Also, when it comes to foraging you never stop learning, and the more that I know, the more that I can teach!</p>
<p>In addition to the two items listed above, there are fees to take into account when running an Indiegogo campaign:</p>
<ul>
<li>$32.50 in platform fees (5% of total)</li>
<li>$32.50 in credit card fees (estimate, 3% plus $0.30 of each donation)</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>Stretch Goal- Goal met!</h3>
<p>If my campaign raises more than $650 (and I sincerely hope it does!) I will spend up to an additional $100 on books. However, if I raise an additional $150 and <strong>reach my stretch goal of $800,</strong> I will be able to use that money to buy a printer to produce workshop materials! Any money raised beyond that will go directly toward workshop costs.<br/> </p>
<h3>Perks!</h3>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why It Matters</h3>
<p>There are no regularly scheduled foraging workshops in the Twin Cities. I have seen parks, restaurants, and organizations offer workshops here and there, but nothing to meet the current demand. Furthermore, not all of these workshops are affordable or otherwise accessible. Four Season Foraging will keep events as affordable as possible by offering classes at different price levels. Furthermore, I welcome people of all backgrounds, and will make an effort to hold workshops that are family-friendly and wheelchair-accessible. </p>

<p>In my role as a program coordinator and educator at various non-profits, I have witnessed first-hand the positive impact of picking ones own foods and medicines. Children, adults, and elders are equally delighted when they discover edible plants that grow right in their own backyard! Furthermore, food has the power to connect people with each other. And if that food is harvested from the wild, there's a connection with the landbase as well. In this increasingly detached culture, I feel it is of utmost importance to cultivate these relationships.</p>

In 2013 founded a 501(c)3 nonprofit with five associates.

<p><strong>This has promoted me to produce a series of APP stories for parents and children that deal simply and sensitively with these childhood issues.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What better way to put my two passions together than by creating Vegetable Islands, each with a friendly vegetable who finds a positive way to resolve a personal puzzle?</strong></p>
<p><strong>I believe that happy hearts are healthy hearts, so the interactive links in the e-stories also reveal fun facts about the featured vegetable and it's special contribution to your child's physical development.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Today's children, raised in a fast food culture are falling victim to obesity, diabetes, early heart disease and have poor protection from common coughs and colds.  Lack of exercise is also a factor.  </strong></p>
<p><strong>All the vegetables in these stories actively explore their island, where each discovers something more precious than gold.  </strong></p>
<p><strong>Each Vegetable Islands e-story includes a recipe for tasty, easy to cook vegetable dish. This dish is just a suggestion and not the be all and end all of the perfect vegetable dish for your child.</strong></p>
<p><strong>These 10 self-contained stories are designed to be downloaded and read individually on an IPad or tablet with my downloadable APP.</strong></p>
<p><strong>By entering in the details of the reader, makes the APP SPECIAL to them alone!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Imagine having a book written JUST FOR YOU! Remember too, that you can change the name of the person that it is written for as well, so that it can potentially be shared around the one family as well...</strong></p>

</div></div>","We all know that most children have worries.  You child may have a fear of the dark or of sleeping alone - or even maybe sometimes they feel just a little different and left out.
This has promoted me to produce a series of APP stories for parents and children that deal simply and sensitively with these childhood issues.
What better way to put my two passions together than by creating Vegetable Islands, each with a friendly vegetable who finds a positive way to resolve a personal puzzle?
I believe that happy hearts are healthy hearts, so the interactive links in the e-stories also reveal fun facts about the featured vegetable and it's special contribution to your child's physical development.
Today's children, raised in a fast food culture are falling victim to obesity, diabetes, early heart disease and have poor protection from common coughs and colds.  Lack of exercise is also a factor.  
All the vegetables in these stories actively explore their island, where each discovers something more precious than gold.  
Each Vegetable Islands e-story includes a recipe for tasty, easy to cook vegetable dish. This dish is just a suggestion and not the be all and end all of the perfect vegetable dish for your child.
These 10 self-contained stories are designed to be downloaded and read individually on an IPad or tablet with my downloadable APP.
By entering in the details of the reader, makes the APP SPECIAL to them alone!
Imagine having a book written JUST FOR YOU! Remember too, that you can change the name of the person that it is written for as well, so that it can potentially be shared around the one family as well...

Why Green Cities matter!



Cities are shaping our daily life significantly, as already today every second person lives in an urban environment! Over the last decades, humans made cities their “natural habitat” and still tend to exclude nature out of it.
By the year 2050 more than two-third of the world population will be living in cities. This represents a number of 6.4 billion people. Worldwide people immigrate to cities, hoping to find a better place to live. Urban development creates new and unknown problems. The question of space in urban areas, access to clean water, intensive traffic and increase of environmental pollution are just a few examples of the challenges that cities are facing all over the world.
As we are facing global problems we have to rethink our behavior to create conditions on earth worth living, also for future generations.

For this reason we are trying to spread and extend the knowledge about sustainable projects in cities and to find new ways to improve those methods used and create new ones to work together for a more worth-living-environment in our cities.

<p>The students at École KLO Middle School are working tirelessly, against all odds, to try to restore the lost turtle habitat on their school grounds which has been covered by concrete pads. But this re-naturalization doesn’t just give the blue-listed Western Painted Turtles a safe place to grow up away from the school’s long jump sandpits.

<p>
</p><p>These students need your help to get there.

<p>The students at École KLO Middle School have been working on a now seven-year struggle to restore the often flooded concrete-covered wetland habitat that once ran through their school grounds. Initiated by students’ discovery of blue-listed Western Painted Turtle eggs in their long jump sand pits, this school’s community began to restore the species’ disappearing habitat. Originally challenged to raise $100,000 their school board for this habitat’s restoration, multiple “generations” of students remarkably raised $86,000 Unfortunately, in an updated quote, these students recently discovered their project will now cost half a million dollars. Although dismayed and disappointed, through work on this issue, the students and teachers involved ended up creating a process of discovery- how the natural world is an educational resource gold mine.</p> <p></p> <p> </p><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>This project will be starting the first phase of its development this summer. This means a small section of the re-naturalization will take place but no more than that and the rest will have to be implemented over a longer period of time in subsequent phases. Although it is a good thing that this is actually beginning to happen, it is more intrusive and not as beneficial to the human and more-than-human natural community on the school grounds. The reason this has to be started is because it has taken so long to raise just a 5th of the funds for this project some of the grants these students have received are about to time-out. Unfortunately, going 7 years for every $86,000 is just not a feasible option for these students, the first ""generation"" of whom are now starting University. With your support, this doesn't have to take the next 30 YEARS to happen, in a world of disappearing funds for the natural in education and a disappearing presence of the environment in the lives of young people, these students need their natural learning environment just as much as those baby turtles need this living environment, </p><ul></ul><p></p> <p> </p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>You can also buy the book these students have published to raise funds for this project which shares each of their unique experiences learning from and caring for the natural world.</p><p><b>eBook:</b> <a href=""http://www.amazon.ca/This-My-Classroom-Created-Leaders-ebook/dp/B00KTUZG9G/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1402207111&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=this+is+my+classroom+shimshon+obadia"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.amazon.ca/This-My-Classroom-Created-Leaders-ebook/dp/B00KTUZG9G/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1402207111&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=this+is+my+classroom+shimshon+obadia</a></p><p><b>Print book: </b><a href=""https://www.createspace.com/4845799"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.createspace.com/4845799</a> </p><p>For more on the Daylighting the Classroom project, visit: <a href=""http://www.ShimshonObadia.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.ShimshonObadia.com</a>  &amp; <a href=""http://www.EcoArtIncubator.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.EcoArtIncubator.com</a><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""> </span></p></div>","Short Summary

The reason this has to be started is because it has taken so long to raise just a 5th of the funds for this project some of the grants these students have received are about to time-out. Unfortunately, going 7 years for every $86,000 is just not a feasible option for these students, the first ""generation"" of whom are now starting University. With your support, this doesn't have to take the next 30 YEARS to happen, in a world of disappearing funds for the natural in education and a disappearing presence of the environment in the lives of young people, these students need their natural learning environment just as much as those baby turtles need this living environment,   Other Ways You Can Help You can also buy the book these students have published to raise funds for this project which shares each of their unique experiences learning from and caring for the natural world.eBook: http://www.amazon.ca/This-My-Classroom-Created-Leaders-ebook/dp/B00KTUZG9G/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1402207111&sr=1-1&keywords=this+is+my+classroom+shimshon+obadiaPrint book: https://www.createspace.com/4845799 For more on the Daylighting the Classroom project, visit: www.ShimshonObadia.com  & www.EcoArtIncubator.com",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><strong>THE CHALLENGE</strong></h3>
<p>URKU, with its seven hectares of rainforest, is situated within the buffer zone of the Cordillera Escalera Protected Area, a few kilometres from the city of Tarapoto, Peru. We are a community centre that promotes life in harmony with nature and the responsible management of its resources. We work together as a team of professionals, interns, scientists and volunteers to rescue animals from illegal wildlife trade and strengthen conservation efforts in Amazonia. Our fundraising campaign, “RESCUE TO RELEASE”, seeks to raise urgently needed funds to scale up our activities of wildlife rescue and release. We aim to release 500 animals back to their original habitats per year and build awareness on wildlife conservation by sharing our important message with 15,000 annual visitors at the centre.</p>

<h3><strong>ILLEGAL WILDLIFE TRADE, AN ISSUE THAT CONCERNS US ALL</strong></h3>
<p>Illegal wildlife trade is a global issue that has a destabilising effect on both our ecosystems, as well as our society, and hinders sustainable development. It is the fourth largest illegal trade in the world and continues to operate at such vast scale due to the lack of control and weak government enforcement. Illegal traders exploit loopholes and wild-caught animals are extensively laundered, i.e. declared and sold as legal captive-bred animals. </p>
<p>Peru’s rainforests harbour an immensely rich fauna, which is sadly disappearing at an alarming rate. Illegal wildlife trade is the second main cause of defaunation after habitat destruction. Hundreds of species are exploited; parrots, parakeets, macaws and turtles are particularly targeted for pet trade and their use as tourist attractions. Other animals, regrettably, have high value as skins, furs and leathers. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1531430146/xtojrlpunkiryuhq7xmf.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>In Peru, it is estimated that 20 animals are captured illegally from the wild every minute. </strong>According to the environmental authorities, more than 5000 specimens were confiscated between 2013 and 2017 just in our province, San Martín. The most common animals were various species of parakeets, parrots, and macaws, primates such as capuchins and Andean saddle-back tamarins, South-American coati, yellow-footed tortoises (vulnerable according to the IUCN Redlist), yellow-spotted Amazon river turtles (vulnerable according to the IUCN Redlist), and sloths.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1531352850/oeueb0o684rx7pgcp7oq.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>Yellow-spotted Amazon river turtle basking in the early morning sun. The species is threatened with extinction, mainly due to illegal trafficking. </i><i>(Photo: M. Helve)</i></p>
<p>Unfortunately, due to the poor taxonomic understanding and species identification skills of intercepting authorities, the existing data suffers from major inaccuracy and gaps. For example, smaller animals such as poisonous frogs and exotic butterflies are conspicuously absent from these registries, yet they are extremely prevalent in wildlife trade. To make matters worse, once an animal <u>is</u> rescued by the authorities, it is rarely guaranteed a safe journey back to its habitat. Unfortunately, more than 90% of all rescued animals in Peru have to be put down or die because of inadequate facilities, and lack of professional care and critical resources. Moreover, animals rescued from the networks of illegal trade can carry a series of parasites and diseases that will put wild populations at risk. Appropriate rescue and release programme must apply bio-security protocols to avoid the introduction of a potential threat to the species.</p>

<p><i>Interns Thalía and Rodolfo in the daily activity of feeding our animals. (Photo: M. Helve)</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Since 2006, Urku Centre has sheltered over a thousand wild animals representing 61 species, of which approximately 30% were returned to the wild. A great majority of them have been wild animals rescued from illegal wildlife trade. Wild animals are confiscated by the authorities from people’s homes, where they are kept as pets in often inhumane conditions; or are intercepted along the trade routes heading for international markets.</p>
<p>We at <a href=""https://www.urkuperu.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Urku</a> work tirelessly, yet despite our greatest efforts and all that we have accomplished to date, we consider our impact small in comparison with the magnitude of illegal wildlife trade in Peru. The running of Urku Centre and its animal inhabitants requires a highly dedicated team of professionals, interns and volunteers throughout the year. Each animal requires feeding twice a day, water, veterinary care, and appropriate shelter, as well as an enriched environment with stimulation to ensure its overall welfare. To sustain our operating costs, Urku Centre receives 12,000 visitors annually from all over the world. We put great emphasis on environmental education to create behavioural shift in the society and reduce the demand and offer for illicitly sold wild animals, as well as the number of persons that take to poaching as a livelihood.</p>

<h3><strong>SCALING UP OUR IMPACT</strong></h3>
<p>Our alternative vision counts on your participation. We firmly believe that a greater mass of people supporting our mission can be the decisive force to make a change. Be part of the movement to stop the illegal activities that destroy our rainforests and wetlands and deplete populations of wild animals. As Amazonians and guardians of the forest, we seek to restore the lost connection with our natural home. We’ve therefore turned to crowdfunding, as we believe that our voices in concert can act against illegal networks and political apathy. Urku receives no state or regional funding and proudly self-sustains its operations.</p>
<p>However, we now make <strong>a special appeal</strong> to take our activities to the next level. Our existing enclosures and aviaries need improvement and renovation, we need to systematise our work to become more efficient and thus be able to shelter more animals. Most importantly, we want to rescue to release them. The fundamental goal is always that the animals rescued from illegal trade are released back into the wild and according to correct protocol. Unfortunately, this is often unfeasible because the animals no longer have the skills to survive on their own due to their trafficking experience. </p>
<p>We currently release, on average, 50 animals to their natural habitat per year. We want the number of animals released per year to rise to 500, focusing our efforts on the following groups: parrots, small reptiles and amphibians. Furthermore, there is a pressing need for the monitoring of released animals in the wild, an activity which currently does not exist in Peru.</p>

<p>We hope that the global community will hear our appeal and show support for our work and mission. Your participation and help, in all corners of the world, is indispensable. Our goal is to raise US$ 25,000 to scale up our impact.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>   As a leader in raising environmental awareness within the underground world of skimboarding, Sol Shred Skim will be holding its 2nd Annual UCAN Beach Clean-up at the World Championship of Skimboarding (WCS) on July 16-17, 2011.  Since the late 70s, this highly anticipated contest has traditionally taken place at Aliso Beach Park of Laguna Beach, CA.  Although the landscape of the beach park is quite attractive to visitors and locals, the pollution and debris spewing out of Aliso Creek (which divides the area in half) is certainly not.  Many people do not realize how contaminated the urban runoff is until they see warning signs highlighting the harmful effects of entering the water (especially after rainy days).  <br/></p>
<p>   The question is:   “What CAN U do about the situation?”   The solution 
is simple.   UCAN Clean-up Aliso!   UCAN stands for. . . yo<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">U</span> <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">C</span>ontribute <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">A</span>wareness <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">N</span>ecessary.  This beach clean-up campaign was launched last year by Sol Shred Skim at the WCS due to the approval of the contest's main host -- Victoria Skimboards.  Tex Haines, founder &amp; owner of Victoria Skimboards, was so pleased with the conscious idea that he designated it as an annual ritual coinciding with the WCS from 2010 and beyond.  <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>   At the apex of all living organisms that thrive on this planet, humans contain the power to act on anything their minds create.  With such an amazing gift, why not give back to Mama Earth and her oceans whenever possible?  There are plenty of ways to reciprocate the love she offers us freely.  Grocery shopping with reusable bags and drinking water from stainless steel or aluminum containers is more than just a ""green"" fad nowadays.  The future of our precious planet relies on the choices we make as an entire species and it is our responsibility to acclimate to the changing courses of the present.  Sol Shred Skim's biggest passion is to lead by example and inspire those along the journey with us.  Remember. . . yoU Contribute Awareness Necessary so take the initiative to clean the beaches we love to play on!</p>

<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</p>
</div><div>
<p><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">   Last year, $1330 was invested in the inaugural UCAN Beach Clean-up (not including product from sponsors).  Every volunteer who helped clean the beach was given a trash bag and a pair of gloves.  When 18 volunteers brought back their stuffed trash bags, each of them received a raffle ticket and a chance to win prizes donated by a handful of sponsors.  <br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""> <br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Here is the clear breakdown:</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">$30 - Trash bags &amp; gloves<br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">$100 - UCAN banner</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">$200 - Stickers<br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">$400 - Reusable bags printed with inaugural UCAN art</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">$600 - UCAN trucker hats </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">   This year, Sol Shred Skim plans to order reusable water bottles with our logo on them.  Based on last year's budget, since we still have the UCAN banner, we will be able to put that $100 toward our goal to downsize the use of plastic water bottles.  Realistically, Sol Shred Skim needs to raise over $1000 to be on the same level of succession as last year.  We have humbly set a goal for $888 to assure that we reach it.  If we do not meet our campaign's goal, Sol Shred Skim will gratefully take what is available and work with the funds in a frugal manner.  We also have the option of asking previous and/or prospective sponsors for money instead of product.  </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Perks</span><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">   We have 2 limited edition trucker hats, designed by artist Hunter Trevelyan Wyndham, in black and brown left from the inaugural UCAN Beach Clean-up.  As an incentive, we are offering them to the first 2 individuals who donate $50 to our campaign.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">   Also, a one-of-a-kind loose fitting cotton black dress with an adjustable waistline and Sol Shred Skim logos (size Small) will go to the first individual who donates $100. <br/></p>

is simple.   UCAN Clean-up Aliso!   UCAN stands for. . . yoU Contribute Awareness Necessary.  This beach clean-up campaign was launched last year by Sol Shred Skim at the WCS due to the approval of the contest's main host -- Victoria Skimboards.  Tex Haines, founder & owner of Victoria Skimboards, was so pleased with the conscious idea that he designated it as an annual ritual coinciding with the WCS from 2010 and beyond.  


The Impact
   At the apex of all living organisms that thrive on this planet, humans contain the power to act on anything their minds create.  With such an amazing gift, why not give back to Mama Earth and her oceans whenever possible?  There are plenty of ways to reciprocate the love she offers us freely.  Grocery shopping with reusable bags and drinking water from stainless steel or aluminum containers is more than just a ""green"" fad nowadays.  The future of our precious planet relies on the choices we make as an entire species and it is our responsibility to acclimate to the changing courses of the present.  Sol Shred Skim's biggest passion is to lead by example and inspire those along the journey with us.  Remember. . . yoU Contribute Awareness Necessary so take the initiative to clean the beaches we love to play on!
   
What We Need & What You Get


   Last year, $1330 was invested in the inaugural UCAN Beach Clean-up (not including product from sponsors).  Every volunteer who helped clean the beach was given a trash bag and a pair of gloves.  When 18 volunteers brought back their stuffed trash bags, each of them received a raffle ticket and a chance to win prizes donated by a handful of sponsors.  
 
Here is the clear breakdown:
$30 - Trash bags & gloves
$100 - UCAN banner
$200 - Stickers
$400 - Reusable bags printed with inaugural UCAN art
$600 - UCAN trucker hats 

   This year, Sol Shred Skim plans to order reusable water bottles with our logo on them.  Based on last year's budget, since we still have the UCAN banner, we will be able to put that $100 toward our goal to downsize the use of plastic water bottles.  Realistically, Sol Shred Skim needs to raise over $1000 to be on the same level of succession as last year.  We have humbly set a goal for $888 to assure that we reach it.  If we do not meet our campaign's goal, Sol Shred Skim will gratefully take what is available and work with the funds in a frugal manner.  We also have the option of asking previous and/or prospective sponsors for money instead of product.  

Perks

   We have 2 limited edition trucker hats, designed by artist Hunter Trevelyan Wyndham, in black and brown left from the inaugural UCAN Beach Clean-up.  As an incentive, we are offering them to the first 2 individuals who donate $50 to our campaign.
   Also, a one-of-a-kind loose fitting cotton black dress with an adjustable waistline and Sol Shred Skim logos (size Small) will go to the first individual who donates $100. 

Other Ways You Can Help

   If you truly believe in our campaign and would like to help us raise the maximum amount of funds, please feel free to share our story and profile through word-of-mouth, email, and social networking.  Thank you for all of your support and love!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

This not just the chance to build a home for an amazing man and his family but also an outstanding educational opportunity.  A chance to allow the people of Comalapa, Guatemala to experience the magic of Earthships on their own terms.

Who is Romeo?
Romeo is a former corn farmer in Comalapa, Guatemala, a community where 67% of the population lives of less than $2 a day.  Romeo has continually shown his commitment to sustainable construction with the Long Way Home Project becoming the build team foreman for their school construction project in 2009.  Although Romeo has always been an active ambassador for sustainable housing in his community, he sadly cannot afford such a house of his own.  It is for him and his family that we will be building this home.
 

Who are we?
Mykal and Nico started the project Chainge the Cycle with the aim of exploring the Americas on a self-made Bamboo Bicycle visiting, promoting, documenting and sharing as many sustainable alternatives to our energy-rich lifestyle as they can visit.  They are currently at the centre of Earthship technology in Taos, New Mexico where they have joined up with two other Earthship enthusiasts Justin and Katy for this project in Guatemala.  
 You can follow our trip and learn as we learn via www.chaingethecycle.org

What is an Earthship?
An Earthship is a radically sustainable building design where homes are largely constructed using the byproducts of modern society, such as cans, bottles and tires.
Earthships will also:• Heat and cool themselves naturally • Collect their own power from sun and wind • Harvest their own water from rain • Contain and treat their own sewage • Produce a significant amount of food indoors and out
Please feel free to explore more at www.earthship.com
 

What type of Earthship will be built in Guatemala?
The type of earthship we will be building for Romeo and his family will be the 3u Simple Survival Model.  This encompasses adapted versions of all the traditional Earthship systems including a stylised bucket shower, an 'outlaw' septic using an ingeniously simple filtering system based upon tires, grey and black water systems encompassed in tandem with internal and external flora development (gardens), a solar electric system and a passive heating and cooling system
What We Need
We estimate the entire house building project to cost around $55 000  All we are asking for in this campaign is the cost of the water management system, which we estimate to be around $4000.  However, please feel free to donate above and beyond that goal as all obtained funds will be used to fund the building of the rest of the house.  An estimated break up of the costs are as follow:
Anticipated Costs: 
Sediment Filters                 $100
OGWM Pipes and fitting           $150
2 x 1,700 gallon tank                   $2,200
Tank fittings and pipe                       $150
Cement for planters                               $200
Roofing materials                                      $1200
Estimated Total Material Costs:           $4,000
The installation of the water management system and the built of the earthship will be done entirely by people working on a voluntary base, so there are no costs involved related to salaries being paid for this project .
 

 

If we don't manage to raise the full 4.000 dollars..  Then what?

We Cry. .  . .
More seriously, with $3.000 we won't be able to put the full water management project in practice, but all 4 of us can still contribute to the Earthship being built in Guatemala.With less than $3.000 it will be less people that are able to travel down to Guatemala, but 2 or 3 can still contribute to the Earthship being built in Guatemala.With less than $1.500 we won't be able to contribute to the building in Guatemala at all, but we will donate our knowledge and the money raised to Earthship Biotecture for the earthship built in Guatemala. 



The Impact of this project
This is an educational project for local Guatemalan people and all the international volunteers involved!  Chainge the Cycle aims to expand the education by documenting the process in pictures and share knowledge globally through their website www.chaingethecycle.org

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>Pragya Seeds International is a international organization composed by Western and Nepali professionals who want to work towards reconciliation between social, material and environmental prosperity in the world. To reach that objective, we are promoting the use of sustainable and efficient technological and business practices that can improve people comfort, their economy and environment.</p>
<p>This work is important for us in a time of confusion between comfort and consumption, which leads our economy to go against our well-being and our environment. PGSI want to show how we can stop accepting a trade off between economical progress and socio-environmental sustainability.</p>
<p>Starting with Kathmandu, PGSI will create community managed decentralized low costs Resource Recovery centers that will transform wastes into valuable resources. As a first project, PGSI has realized a partnership with local garbage collectors, women groups and a farmer cooperative active in Microfinance in order to create a first center, which will transform organic wastes into compost, and biogas that will be used for farming activities.</p>
<p>To reach that objective, we need to work on both infrastructure and community awareness. Although building the compost and biogas production unit is essential, work needs to be done to convince local households already using garbage collectors service to start segregation at home.</p>
<p>After 1 year of preparation on the field, PGSI is convinced that with your help as a funder, it will succeed in creating an example of efficient waste to resource project that will then be replicated in other places of Nepal and other countries afterwards.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Although we are very exited about our project, we must go step by step to ensure final success and proper use of our funders’ money. For the 6 first months, PGSI will invest in the compost production, the training of garbage collectors, women groups operating the plant and promoting at source segregation to garbage collectors clients.</p>
<p>Afterwards, PGSI will invest in a Biogas production unit that will be used to produce heat and electricity.</p>
<p>For the first phase, PGSI is targeting 10000 USD that will be used as follows within 6 months:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>-       Compost production units for 1 ton per day capacity: 5000 USD</p>
<p>-       Training of garbage collectors and local communities: 1500 USD</p>
<p>-       Office costs for Pragya Seeds Nepal staff working on the project: 1500 USD</p>
<p>-       Monitoring cost (travel, accommodation, reporting expenses): 2000 USD</p>
<p>If we cannot collect the entire amount, PGSI will invest in priority in the two first sections keeping an appropriate proportion.</p>
<p>To those who will support the project:</p>
<p>5 $ or more – You will receive a report on the project progress every 6 months</p>
<p>50$ or more – You will receive e-pictures of the project with your name as a sponsor</p>
<p>100$ or more – You will receive a present made in Nepal at your home</p>
<p>250$ or more – You or one of your relative will be allowed to take part to our volunteering program without any administrative costs</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>This project has been designed carefully while learning from similar successful and unsuccessful ones.</p>
<p>Three ingredient to success are gathered here:</p>
<ol>
<li>Involvement of local communities that includes local inhabitant, private sectors, local government and farmers.</li>
<li>Use of low cost technologies easy to maintain for local communities</li>
<li>Generation of income for sustainable activities: the compost and biogas are sold to local farmers at a competitive price, which help them to improve their production of vegetables.</li>
</ol>
<p>Local actors are convinced by this approach and are only waiting to see how good it will work.</p>
<p>All the partnerships are ready and now the only thing to add is the initial funding that will make this project real!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<div>We are the UNC-Chapel Hill Sierra Student Coalition, an organization working to protect the environment. Currently we are working on a new Campuses Beyond Coal campaign with the goal of getting UNC to divest its endowment from the coal industry and make positive sustainability investments in responsible, renewable energy. Coal is a leading cause of public health issues and climate change, two things our university is working to combat.  Why are we continuing to invest in something that it undermining our efforts? Last year 77% of UNC students supported our campaign and voted in favor divesting from coal. Together seek to make UNC a leader in the environmental movement, making our planet healthier.<br/>
</div>
<p>The UNC-Chapel Hill Sierra Student Coalition is requesting funding to allow 9 members to attend the biennial PowerShift environmental conference in Pittsburgh, PA from October 18th-21st. PowerShift is a convergence of over 10,000 youth leaders in the environmental movement from across the country and features a full schedule of workshops, film screenings, speakers, presentations, break out groups, regional convergences and networking opportunities. Since UNC Chapel Hill Sierra Student coalition is currently working on a divestment campaign with a national scope (308 other colleges are running this campaign), PowerShift represents a one time opportunity to network, share stories and swap ideas and strategies with thousands of other students running similar campaigns (especially other North Carolina students). We hope that the knowledge and connections we gain at PowerShift will significantly leverage our efforts back at UNC, leading to the benefit of the university of a whole as we move towards more sustainable investments. </p>
<p>UNC CH's Beyond Coal campaign is fighting to solve the climate crisis and <strong>build a clean, just and thriving economy by standing up on our campuses and in our communities</strong> to demand real solutions that work for everyone. We have put our fists in the air and our bodies on the line to stop our university from investing in a industry that is threatening the health of our planet with its emissions.  <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Which is why this fall, we want to be where 10,000+ youth leaders will converge in Pittsburgh, PA to fight for our future.</p>
<p>Together we’ll build the movement to fight fracking, divest from fossil fuels, build a clean energy future, and stop the climate crisis.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p></p>
<p>We want to go to Powershift 2013 in Pittsburgh on Oct 18th because more than ten thousand youth leaders from every walk of life — college students, young environmental justice leaders, DREAMers, young people of faith, young workers — will be there to learn from one another, and to build and launch strategic campaigns in their own communities.</p>
<p><strong>And Power Shift 2013 is just the beginning.</strong></p>
<p>Power Shift 2013 will launch hundreds of sustained campaigns and mass actions to demand climate justice. Together with universities across the country we will unite in a drumbeat calling for change that will not be ignored.</p>
<p>Your contribution will assure that UNC-CH will not miss out on this call to action, and that change will be felt in North Carolina as well!</p>

<blockquote><i><b>An english description follows beneath</b></i></blockquote><p>Collecte de
fonds pour la Ferme Morgan</p>
<p></p>
<p>Nous sommes
extrêmement heureux d’annoncer que nous construirons une serre solaire passive
quatre saisons au printemps 2014 à la <a href=""http://www.fermemorgan.com/?lang=fr"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ferme Morgan</a>.
Cette nouvelle construction remplacera la serre actuelle de la ferme (voir la
vidéo). La nouvelle serre s’inspire des principes des Earthships et de
différents bâtiments construits au Québec durant l’été 2013 à partir des
concepts de Christian Desilet et de Francis Gendron de <a href=""http://www.solutionera.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">SolutionEra</a>.
</p>
<p><b>L’équipe</b></p>
<p>Jean-Nick,
Félicia et moi-même (Jesse Richman) sommes très reconnaissants d’avoir
l’occasion de travailler avec la coopérative de la Ferme Morgan (CoopéraVie
Morgan) pour construire une serre durable à partir de matériaux recyclés. Nous
accueillerons des bénévoles désireux d’en apprendre davantage sur les bâtiments
de style Earthship et sur le fonctionnement d’une coopérative bio.</p>
<p>Jean-Nick,
Félicia et moi avons tous trois suivi la formation de l’Académie Earthship (Earthship
Biotecture Academy) au Nouveau-Mexique, et nous voulons maintenant appliquer ce
que nous avons appris et contribuer à l’évolution du secteur du bâtiment
durable au Québec et ailleurs dans le monde. Nous n’aurions pas pu imaginer un
meilleur scénario : l’occasion de réaliser un projet de serre avec une
coopérative axée sur l’engagement communautaire, la durabilité et les pratiques
agricoles sécuritaires. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/459132/files/20140325102851-523526_562859393780117_765012647_n.jpg?1395768531"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><i>Jean-Nick et moi au Nouveau-Mexique</i></p><p></p><p><b>Un retour aux sources</b></p><p>Pour moi, ce projet est doublement stimulant. D’abord parce qu’il nous donne l’occasion de travailler avec une coopérative dynamique, mais également parce qu’il s’agit d’un retour aux sources. En effet, j’ai grandi sur cette ferme, et je suis heureux de découvrir la communauté qui s’est créée ici et qui continue d’évoluer au fil des saisons. Pour moi, le fait de découvrir les mécanismes d’une coopérative et de contribuer à son objectif d’autosuffisance toute l’année s’aligne parfaitement avec les valeurs que j’espère explorer plus en profondeur. Ça semble évident. Il s’agit d’une occasion d’établir des liens avec un réseau grandissant de personnes qui cherchent des façons de s’entraider dans leur découverte d’un mode de vie durable et différent.</p><p><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/459135/files/20140325103042-FIERY_DC700311__1__copy.jpg?1395768642"" src="""" style=""""/><i>Dessiné à l’échelle par Félicia Monette</i></i></p><p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Un autre pas</b></p>
<p>Fort du
succès de ma dernière expérience de financement participatif<span>, je m’apprête
maintenant à lancer une deuxième campagne. Nous ferons ainsi appel à toutes les
personnes qui sont disposées à donner un appui financier à un groupe de gens
motivés et inspirés afin de les aider à réaliser leur rêve : appliquer des
solutions pratiques à des problèmes environnementaux et sociaux. Voilà ce qui
me motive, et je sais que nous sommes nombreux à partager ce rêve, y compris à
la Ferme Morgan. </span></p>
<p><b>Les voix de la coop </b></p>
<p>La
CoopéraVie Morgan est heureuse de collaborer avec Jesse Richman et son équipe
et d’ainsi profiter des fruits de leurs actions. Nous avons plusieurs valeurs
en commun, par exemple un désir d’autosuffisance alimentaire toute l’année.
Cette serre permettra à notre coopérative de produire des aliments 12 mois par
année et d’appliquer progressivement nos principes fondamentaux entourant
l’engagement communautaire, la durabilité et l’utilisation de pratiques
agricoles sécuritaires. </p>

<p></p>
<p><b>Où va l’argent?</b></p>
<p>L’argent
donné au projet servira à l’achat de matériaux et d’outils que nous ne pourrons
pas obtenir par recyclage. Par exemple, le matériau qui couvrira le toit
orienté vers le sud. Nous utiliserons de l’<a href=""http://hortimax.biz"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ETFE</a>,
un matériau idéal pour ce
genre de bâtiment, puisqu’il est isolant et résistant et qu’il transmet un
spectre de lumière plus large, ce qui favorisera la croissance des plantes.</p>
<p>Nous sommes
sûrs que votre soutien dans le cadre de cette campagne nous permettra de
couvrir toutes les dépenses matérielles du projet. De plus, nous accueillerons
les groupes et les individus disposés à offrir leur temps. </p>

<p>Le concept
de Earthship a évolué en réponse à l’incapacité de nos économies à répondre à
nos besoins de base, c’est-à-dire l’accès à de l’eau potable propre, à une
alimentation saine et à des abris dynamiques et respectueux de l’environnement.
Essentiellement, les earthships recueillent l’eau de pluie, produisent leur
propre électricité et utilisent les rayons du soleil pour chauffer l’intérieur
de façon passive et pour faire pousser de la nourriture.</p>
<p>De plus, les
earthships utilisent des matériaux recyclés (comme des pneus) qui s’accumulent
partout dans le monde. <a href=""http://earthship.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Earthship Biotecture</a> a été créé il y a 40 ans par Mike
Reynolds, un architecte avec une vision originale. Selon lui, notre économie est
un obstacle qui nous empêche de subvenir à nos besoins de base. Notre société
produit des ordures qui polluent la planète. Les earthships recyclent ces matériaux
afin de transcender l’économie et d’accéder à la liberté qui accompagne une vie
en harmonie avec les éléments de la nature. Simple, n’est-ce pas?</p>

fonds pour la Ferme Morgan

Nous sommes
extrêmement heureux d’annoncer que nous construirons une serre solaire passive
quatre saisons au printemps 2014 à la Ferme Morgan.
Cette nouvelle construction remplacera la serre actuelle de la ferme (voir la
vidéo). La nouvelle serre s’inspire des principes des Earthships et de
différents bâtiments construits au Québec durant l’été 2013 à partir des
concepts de Christian Desilet et de Francis Gendron de SolutionEra.

L’équipe
Jean-Nick,
Félicia et moi-même (Jesse Richman) sommes très reconnaissants d’avoir
l’occasion de travailler avec la coopérative de la Ferme Morgan (CoopéraVie
Morgan) pour construire une serre durable à partir de matériaux recyclés. Nous
accueillerons des bénévoles désireux d’en apprendre davantage sur les bâtiments
de style Earthship et sur le fonctionnement d’une coopérative bio.
Jean-Nick,
Félicia et moi avons tous trois suivi la formation de l’Académie Earthship (Earthship
Biotecture Academy) au Nouveau-Mexique, et nous voulons maintenant appliquer ce
que nous avons appris et contribuer à l’évolution du secteur du bâtiment
durable au Québec et ailleurs dans le monde. Nous n’aurions pas pu imaginer un
meilleur scénario : l’occasion de réaliser un projet de serre avec une
coopérative axée sur l’engagement communautaire, la durabilité et les pratiques
agricoles sécuritaires. 
Jean-Nick et moi au Nouveau-MexiqueUn retour aux sourcesPour moi, ce projet est doublement stimulant. D’abord parce qu’il nous donne l’occasion de travailler avec une coopérative dynamique, mais également parce qu’il s’agit d’un retour aux sources. En effet, j’ai grandi sur cette ferme, et je suis heureux de découvrir la communauté qui s’est créée ici et qui continue d’évoluer au fil des saisons. Pour moi, le fait de découvrir les mécanismes d’une coopérative et de contribuer à son objectif d’autosuffisance toute l’année s’aligne parfaitement avec les valeurs que j’espère explorer plus en profondeur. Ça semble évident. Il s’agit d’une occasion d’établir des liens avec un réseau grandissant de personnes qui cherchent des façons de s’entraider dans leur découverte d’un mode de vie durable et différent.Dessiné à l’échelle par Félicia Monette

Un autre pas
Fort du
succès de ma dernière expérience de financement participatif, je m’apprête
maintenant à lancer une deuxième campagne. Nous ferons ainsi appel à toutes les
personnes qui sont disposées à donner un appui financier à un groupe de gens
motivés et inspirés afin de les aider à réaliser leur rêve : appliquer des
solutions pratiques à des problèmes environnementaux et sociaux. Voilà ce qui
me motive, et je sais que nous sommes nombreux à partager ce rêve, y compris à
la Ferme Morgan. 
Les voix de la coop 
La
CoopéraVie Morgan est heureuse de collaborer avec Jesse Richman et son équipe
et d’ainsi profiter des fruits de leurs actions. Nous avons plusieurs valeurs
en commun, par exemple un désir d’autosuffisance alimentaire toute l’année.
Cette serre permettra à notre coopérative de produire des aliments 12 mois par
année et d’appliquer progressivement nos principes fondamentaux entourant
l’engagement communautaire, la durabilité et l’utilisation de pratiques
agricoles sécuritaires. 
Des membres et amis de la coop durant une pause-dîner

Où va l’argent?
L’argent
donné au projet servira à l’achat de matériaux et d’outils que nous ne pourrons
pas obtenir par recyclage. Par exemple, le matériau qui couvrira le toit
orienté vers le sud. Nous utiliserons de l’ETFE,
un matériau idéal pour ce
genre de bâtiment, puisqu’il est isolant et résistant et qu’il transmet un
spectre de lumière plus large, ce qui favorisera la croissance des plantes.
Nous sommes
sûrs que votre soutien dans le cadre de cette campagne nous permettra de
couvrir toutes les dépenses matérielles du projet. De plus, nous accueillerons
les groupes et les individus disposés à offrir leur temps. 
Qu’est-ce qu’un
earthship?
Earthship, modèle global
Le concept
de Earthship a évolué en réponse à l’incapacité de nos économies à répondre à
nos besoins de base, c’est-à-dire l’accès à de l’eau potable propre, à une
alimentation saine et à des abris dynamiques et respectueux de l’environnement.
Essentiellement, les earthships recueillent l’eau de pluie, produisent leur
propre électricité et utilisent les rayons du soleil pour chauffer l’intérieur
de façon passive et pour faire pousser de la nourriture.
De plus, les
earthships utilisent des matériaux recyclés (comme des pneus) qui s’accumulent
partout dans le monde. Earthship Biotecture a été créé il y a 40 ans par Mike
Reynolds, un architecte avec une vision originale. Selon lui, notre économie est
un obstacle qui nous empêche de subvenir à nos besoins de base. Notre société
produit des ordures qui polluent la planète. Les earthships recyclent ces matériaux
afin de transcender l’économie et d’accéder à la liberté qui accompagne une vie
en harmonie avec les éléments de la nature. Simple, n’est-ce pas?

earthships

Ce projet
sera axé avant tout sur le volet production alimentaire. Puisqu’il s’agit d’une

conserverons les cinq autres principes.

ingrédients d’une vie simple et pleine sont à notre portée. Voyons maintenant

...................................................................................Fundraising for Morgan Farms
We are extremely happy to be announcing the construction of
a 4 season solar passive greenhouse in the spring of 2014 at Morgan Farms, which will be
replacing an existing greenhouse (as seen in video). This design is inspired
from Earthship principles and is based on several buildings that have been put
up throughout Quebec in the summer of 2013 designed by Christian Desilet and
Francis Gendron from SolutionEra. 
The Team
Jean-Nick, Félicia and I (Jesse Richman) are extremely lucky
to have the opportunity to work with Morgan Farms cooperative (CoopéraVie

to $25,000. Distributed by American Public Television, that film was and
continues to be broadcast on over 150 public television stations in over 30
states. With your help, we can build a community of nature lovers to

where they are needed most in post-production and continue to recruit
supporters and donors.  Quick reminder, though 1) we have a track record
of successful fundraising and community engagement and 2) Jennifer Tennican,
the director/producer of the film, is nicknamed “Jen Tenacious.""</p><h3>Other Ways to Help</h3>

</div>","For the Love of Bert and Nature 


""Far Afield"" is a documentary about a conservation icon, but it's also a love story involving two people, a place and an environment that inspires us all. Bert Raynes is a
man everyone should have the joy of knowing. With a keen intellect, sharp wit
and twinkle in his eye, this 91-year-old continues to inspire the people of
Jackson Hole, Wyoming to observe and care about their wild neighbors. Young, old
and in-between flock to him to discover how to be better stewards of the natural world.
The goal of this film is to introduce the world to Bert and
his vision for how Citizen Scientists can play a meaningful role, working in
tandem with experts, in caring for the wild places we love.""I don't think you can know too much about the
environment. As my wife Meg used to say, 'I like the
environment. I live in it.'""   - Bert
PERKS
We have great perks ranging from Bert’s books to a
pre-screening dinner at the director’s house. Perk packages have
bird names, so whether you're a yellow-rumped warbler or Clark’s nutcracker,
we want to hear your song.  We also have some great “add-on” perks,
including DVDs of the finished film and Bert T-shirts.
Become a Friend of Bert (FOB) 
By helping us make ""Far Afield,"" you'll be spreading Bert's
message that we can band together to make a difference for wildlife
and wild places. We hope this film will inspire other communities to
find and celebrate the ""Berts"" in their backyards, linking multiple
generations of conservationists! Get Us to the Finish Line
We have worked hard to gather early
support for this project and are immensely grateful to our initial 
donors,
who have contributed funds for pre-production and production. Our first grant monies came from 1% for the Tetons.                                                           Other early 
supporters include numerous individuals (FOBs) and non-profits, such as the Community Foundation of Jackson Hole, The Nature Conservancy of Wyoming, National Museum of Wildlife Art, Teton Raptor Center and Center of Wonder. We are
half-way through filming and have film shoots planned for spring and early
summer; post-production is scheduled for mid to late summer.  Funds raised
through our Indiegogo campaign will go toward post-production expenses
including editing, music and graphics. Indiegogo
 allows us to go far afield – beyond the small valley of Jackson Hole - to invite others to participate in “Far
Afield.”  The heart of this film is Bert and his connections and
commitment to community (humans and animals).  Become part of our
Indiegogo campaign community – the community that will help us with the

<p>Hello, my name is Stephen Tolpinrud. I am 26 years old and I recently finished a certificate in Agroecology from UCSC. The certificate, which was obtained while living, working, and studying on a farm, taught me how to grow food using organic methods.  The experience impacted me viscerally.  Since then I have been impassioned to make a difference. That is why this spring I will be riding my bicycle from New York City, NY to Astoria, OR.

Hello, my name is Stephen Tolpinrud. I am 26 years old and I recently finished a certificate in Agroecology from UCSC. The certificate, which was obtained while living, working, and studying on a farm, taught me how to grow food using organic methods.  The experience impacted me viscerally.  Since then I have been impassioned to make a difference. That is why this spring I will be riding my bicycle from New York City, NY to Astoria, OR. I want to use the ride as a catalyst to bring awareness to and fundraise for the construction of a greenhouse and water well for a community in Northern Nicaragua. With the help and guidance of a local non-profit, Waves of Hope, I plan on completing the project during the month of July.

<p><b>WHAT IS THE PROBLEM?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>The
City of Eugene Planning Commission has tentatively approved the Oakleigh Meadow
Co-housing (OMC) Planned unit Development (PUD) application which would allow
multi-family development within the Willamette Greenway at the east end of Oakleigh
Lane. The burden is now on the neighborhood to show the Land Use Board of
Appeals that this type of development does not belong in a small, quiet
neighborhood with inadequate street access. We can’t expect that we
won’t have development within the Urban Growth Boundary, but maxing out the
density, building 90 foot long condominiums, more than doubling the traffic on
Oakleigh, and supporting similar infill in the neighborhood is not compatible
with the existing neighborhood. It is also not compatible with the Willamette
Greenway.

<span>
</span></p><p><span>Eugene
Code requires that the streets serving a new PUD be “safe and adequate.” The
proposed PUD would nearly double the traffic, and the Eugene Public Works
Department (PWD) assessment determined that new and current residents,
pedestrians and bicyclists would be at risk unless Oakleigh Lane were widened
and improved to the City’s adopted street standards. The City Planning Department ignored the PWD’s
evaluation, they even decreased the PWD’s previous determination of the required
width and has tentatively approved the development.  Also, the width currently allowed by the
Planning Department does not meet State or City Fire access requirements.  </span></p>
<p>We urge you to help us protect the
established R-1, single-family neighborhood and retain open space and natural
areas in the Greenway. Please
help us save single family neighborhoods and the Greenway.<span> Our future depends on it.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>HOW WILL FUNDS BE USED?</b></p>
<p><span>The
local neighborhood has been fighting this development for 2 years through
appeals.<span> The project was already remanded
by the Oregon Court of Appeals and The State land Use Board of Appeals (LUBA)
due to procedural and substantive land use errors. The City of Eugene Planning Department, once
again has approved the development with several procedural errors and several substantive
land use errors. The local neighborhood is
again appealing the decision at LUBA. </span>We believe we have very
solid standing for the LUBA appeal. 
However, we need funding to support the appeal. The local neighborhood needs to raise
approximately $15,000 to pay for attorney fees. Neighbors have already raised substantial funding for previous appeals and
we have a committed group of supporters that will continue to find a solution.</span></p>
<p>The
money raised in this campaign will be used for the upcoming LUBA appeal and for
additional appeals, if possible.<span>  </span></p>
<p><b>WHAT IS THE </b><b>SOLUTION?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>The
neighborhood has offered compromise and even attempted mediation with OMC early
in the application process.<span> OMC has
never offered a compromise on size, never acknowledged the neighbor’s concerns
about road safety and increased traffic and ironically, have never acknowledged
the importance of the Greenway.  The neighbors
have been educating the rest of the neighborhood through fliers, posters,
potlucks, and yard sale fundraisers. We
have also explained our concerns with the neighborhood association. The neighborhood
continues to try to find a solution for both parties.  </span></p>
<p>Some
possible solutions are:</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>The
PUD (land use application) gets denied by the City due to inadequate road
standards and successful appeals at LUBA and potentially at Court of Appeals,
reducing the size significantly.</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>A
portion of the property is purchased by the City Parks Department, reducing the
size of the development and preserving some open space.</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>All
of the property gets purchased by the City Parks Department for open space and preservation
of open space in the Willamette Greenway.</p>
<p><b>WHERE IS THE MEADOW AND WHY IS IT UNIQUE?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Oakleigh
Meadow is located at the east end of two dead-end streets, Oakleigh Lane and
McClure Lane. The meadow
is adjacent to City-owned park land along the west side of the Willamette River
along the Ruth-Bascom West Bank multi-use path.<span> The meadow is fully within the
Willamette River Greenway and one-third of the property is below the 100 year
floodplain.  In order to develop the property
to the extent OMC is planning, approximately 1500 cubic yards of fill will be
needed to bring the grade to national flood insurance standards. </span></p>
<p><span>From the City parkland
along the bike path, people can view a variety of wildlife, such as bald
eagles, hawks, owls, osprey, beavers, flickers plus much more. Apple, fir, and
cedar trees are common on the periphery of the meadow.<span> Children playing, dogs running, and neighbors
and others socializing are common activities in the adjacent parkland meadow. OMC has not defined the east private property
and as such many people use the meadow just like the City parkland. This is a special area that should be
preserved, and not developed into 29 unit towering condominiums.  <br/></span></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446310483/fl2lt9epoux9impvcoyt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p>
<p><b>WHO WE ARE?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>We
are the neighbors who live on Oakleigh and McClure Lanes, and supporters from
the area.<span> We are neighbors in an
established modest single-family residential neighborhood. We believe in Oregon’s robust land use laws,
including urban growth boundaries, and appropriate infill policies. We do not believe in destroying what’s left
of the Willamette River Greenway within the City. We also do not believe that safety should be
compromised for intense densification. In addition, we believe in following rules and code, all of which have
been developed in order to balance infill with neighborhood livability.</span></p>
<p>We
are also part of the timely movement throughout Eugene to sustain single-family
neighborhoods, and to fight the City’s unbalanced infill attempts.<span> By appealing this PUD, not only will the City Planning Department be directed to follow their own rules, we will be setting a precedent to preserve single-family neighborhoods throughout Eugene. </span></p>

</h3>
<p>I am a social entrepreneur who has been campaigning for action on climate change for 25 years. </p>
<p>Time is running out for us. We have to speed up. My idea begins with the publication of  a declaration in
an international newspaper, signed by more than a hundred of the winners of the
world’s environmental prizes, saying why we believe the global community can no longer delay meaningful action on global warming, and calling on foundations and philanthropists to throw at least a part of their endowments into the fight while there is still time.</p>
<p>If some of them respond, this would provide the first of the two new pools of capital for bankrolling climate action. If companies and investors see foundations and philanthropists leading this way, they too may join in. </p>
<p>Given that most greenhouse-gas emissions come from fossil-fuel use, much of that new money would go to
building new clean energy projects and companies, and boosting existing ones. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">The key to the second part of the idea is that beneficiaries of the new capital would only receive that money if they donate 5% of their
profits to the same mission: fighting global warming.  That provides the second new pool of capital.</span></p>
<p>If the project succeeds, the prize will be huge and enduring. If clean energy is to replace fossil-fuels to the
extent that will be needed to win the war on global warming in the years ahead, some clean-energy companies will grow like the stars of the internet age, and other new kinds of companies will also be set up, many of them rooted in community ownership. As well as
fighting global warming, the profits for all these entities will be promoting development in poor countries,
big time. </p>
<p>I know this idea can work, in principle. I have done it, in microcosm, with the solar energy company I set up because of my concerns about global warming and other aspects of fossil-fuel dependency, Solarcentury. We give 5% of our annual profits to a charity we created, SolarAid, which has itself created a retail brand, SunnyMoney, that has become the biggest retailer of solar lighting in Africa in just a few years, knocking out oil use for lighting. As we grow, SunnyMoney will be recycling 100% of our profits to the mission.</p>
<p>To start the campaign, I need to raise £30k in the next month. Most of it will pay for the publication of the declaration.

</div></div>","I am a social entrepreneur who has been campaigning for action on climate change for 25 years. 
Time is running out for us. We have to speed up. My idea begins with the publication of  a declaration in
an international newspaper, signed by more than a hundred of the winners of the
world’s environmental prizes, saying why we believe the global community can no longer delay meaningful action on global warming, and calling on foundations and philanthropists to throw at least a part of their endowments into the fight while there is still time.
If some of them respond, this would provide the first of the two new pools of capital for bankrolling climate action. If companies and investors see foundations and philanthropists leading this way, they too may join in. 
Given that most greenhouse-gas emissions come from fossil-fuel use, much of that new money would go to
building new clean energy projects and companies, and boosting existing ones. The key to the second part of the idea is that beneficiaries of the new capital would only receive that money if they donate 5% of their
profits to the same mission: fighting global warming.  That provides the second new pool of capital.
If the project succeeds, the prize will be huge and enduring. If clean energy is to replace fossil-fuels to the
extent that will be needed to win the war on global warming in the years ahead, some clean-energy companies will grow like the stars of the internet age, and other new kinds of companies will also be set up, many of them rooted in community ownership. As well as
fighting global warming, the profits for all these entities will be promoting development in poor countries,
big time. 
I know this idea can work, in principle. I have done it, in microcosm, with the solar energy company I set up because of my concerns about global warming and other aspects of fossil-fuel dependency, Solarcentury. We give 5% of our annual profits to a charity we created, SolarAid, which has itself created a retail brand, SunnyMoney, that has become the biggest retailer of solar lighting in Africa in just a few years, knocking out oil use for lighting. As we grow, SunnyMoney will be recycling 100% of our profits to the mission.
To start the campaign, I need to raise £30k in the next month. Most of it will pay for the publication of the declaration.
Any left over will go to a PR campaign to help all the declaration signatories - many of the most experienced and respected environmentalists in the world - follow up on the declaration. (And yes, they have already agreed to sign it!). 
Why can't Solarcentury pay this £30k? Because I only own 9% of the company. Why can't SolarAid pay for it? It's a brand new idea. We didn't pitch it to our existing funders.

<p>My name is Dr. Debra Durham and I am a wildlife biologist. I started working with chimpanzees in Uganda in 2010.  I fell in love with the animals, made some great friends and quickly realized that Uganda is one of my favorite places on the planet. I continue to be part of wildlife projects there and have been back several times, most recently in May 2013.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/28607_386894782770_3717323_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Smart + Heart: In addition to being a scientist, I also happen to be committed to a life of compassion. That's how <em>Compassion in Action</em> became part of the project name. I think the best solutions to the world's problems are kind to people, animals and the earth.** Projects for wildlife are no exception!</p>
<h2>This is my campaign for (drumroll, please...)</h2>
<h3>the Compassion in Action Mushroom Project, or CAMP for short.</h3>
<p>CAMP is a <strong><em>brand new</em></strong> program that <em><strong>will help women build sustainable micro-businesses</strong></em> growing and selling mushrooms. CAMP promotes alternative sustainable livelihoods in conjunction with chimpanzee conservation.</p>
<h3>Why CAMP for chimps?</h3>
<p>A smart program to reduce human-wildlife conflict and protect wildlife recognizes that empowering people and communities is vital. This is one of the reasons why alternative sustainable livelihoods projects are so important for protecting wildlife, including chimpanzees in Uganda.</p>
<p>I first learned about the possibility of this project back in November 2012. I was in Uganda meeting with colleagues at Chimpanzee Sanctuary and Wildlife Conservation Trust (CSWCT). As you can see, working for chimps is work we all love:</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""spotlight lazy"" data-src=""https://fbcdn-sphotos-a-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/29581_10151204191647771_1119513690_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>It's Summer 2013 and I haven't been able to stop thinking about the mushroom project idea for months. I finally decided I wanted to do what I could to<em> just make it happen</em>.  That's why I put together this funding campaign to ask other smart, compassionate folks to get behind the project with me.  I hope that will include you.</p>
<p>Here's why I'm so excited about CAMP:</p>
<ul>
<li>Green: Small footprint. Solar drying. No impacts on the forest habitat.</li>
<li>Healthy: Mushrooms are not only delicious, they are nutritious!</li>
<li>Compassionate: No animals are harmed, no conflict with wildlife.</li>
</ul><h2><strong>What CAMP needs and what it will do<br/></strong></h2>
<p>The plan for CAMP has two phases that will take us about 8 months.<strong><br/></strong></p>
<div>
<h3>Phase 1: Piloting the project</h3>
<p>The pilot project will provide training and materials to women so they can grow, preserve and sell mushrooms. Business development support will also be offered.</p>
<ul>
<li>After women are recruited to participate in the pilot, CAMP will buy materials and labor to construct mushroom sheds</li>
<li>CAMP will provide each woman with supplies to start her mushroom micro-business.</li>
<li>CAMP will fund one or two solar dryers at a local education center.</li>
<li>Training and ongoing support for growing, preserving and marketing mushrooms will be provided through CAMP funds.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other CAMP funds will help put boots on the ground to get the ball rolling, keep things moving forward and adjust course as needed. We want to be smart and responsive as we work so the project can pivot to meet needs and opportunities along the way.</p>
<h3>Phase 2: Building on our success</h3>
<p>After 6 months, we will go over the project data to figure out what worked best and what needs to be tweaked (or just scrapped) so the project can get better and grow in the future.</p>
<h2>What you get for supporting CAMP</h2>
<p>In recognition of your compassion and support, I've come up with a range of perks, from gorgeous chimpanzee photos to exclusive online project diaries or even a fun, original chimpanzee-themed thank you song composed and recorded just for you.</p>
<p><strong>Cue Moulin Rouge theme song: ""Voulez-vous manger des champignons avec CAMP?""</strong></p>
<p>For those who can drop a bigger chunk of change,  a special project wrap dinner party is a fabulous option. It will include a delicious, homemade, mushroom-themed dinner for you and a guest at <em>Chez Deb</em>. (You must be able to come to Seattle. See other details for this perk, too).</p>
<h3>Are you absolutely in love with CAMP? Super special perk alert!</h3>
<p>You can adopt this project! Whether it's because you love chimps or champignons, or just think that a cool vegan project deserves a chance, your support will be rewarded with the most special of perks: a chance to join us in Uganda to be part of CAMP activities. You will also get to enjoy some delicious, nutritious mushroom dishes (say that three times fast!) at a CAMP team dinner in the field! Please see other special details for this perk.</p>

<h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>
<p>Even if you can’t contribute right now, you can still make a difference for the chimpanzees and the Compassion in Action Mushroom Project (CAMP):</p>
<ul>
<li>Help get the word out and build interest in this compassionate project.  It's easy: just use the Indiegogo share tools! That’s all there is to it.</li>
<li>Eat more mushrooms (and other fruits and veggies).</li>
<li>Learn about Uganda and chimpanzees. Tell others about what you have learned.</li>
<li>Practice compassion toward people, animals and the earth.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p> </p>
<p>**Doctor Deb's notes about why she favors the approach embodied by Compassion in Action:</p>
<p>Approaches that trade the lives of some animals for others, but expect a positive net improvement in the world don't make much sense to my head or my heart. The science is in on this: more animal agriculture and more animal-based foods aren't real solutions because they aren't green, sustainable or healthy.  That's why I think it is so important to find and develop solutions that are smart <em>and kind at heart</em>, like CAMP.</p>
<p>Administrivia: I know that it would be possible to start a non-profit and file the various paperwork so CAMP support could count as charitable donations. That's a later step in my mind.  What needs to come first is a pilot that can be tested in the field and help us figure things out sooner rather than later. Once things are tested and proven so the project can scale, then new infrastructure and administration can be put in place or other organizations could take over funding efforts, etc. I'm aiming for quick and agile so we can make a difference while we learn.</p>
<p>A pilot makes good sense, but it isn't free. I don't want to delay. Human wildlife conflict is a serious risk for chimpanzees - TODAY.  Alternative sustainable livelihoods are needed - NOW. I want to see this pilot project get started ASAP! Thanks for your help making that hope a reality.</p></div>","Hi!  Thanks for stopping by to learn about this project.

<h2><strong>HELP US EXPOSE BIG ENERGY'S LIES &amp; QUITE POSSIBLY SAVE THE WORLD</strong></h2>
<h2> </h2>
<p>Okay, that's a bit dramatic, but only just. The oil &amp; gas industry is lying to you. And the consequences of these lies affect you and everyone you know. These consequences aren't esoteric, or limited to prices at the gas pump. They shape the very face of the planet and impact the quality of life of every living creature. <strong>Help us fight back against Big Energy's billion-dollar spin machine.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Story</strong><br/> We’re being told that – thanks to technological advances like hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling – the US is undergoing an energy revolution, leading us in a few short years to become once again the world’s biggest oil producer and an exporter of natural gas. According to the Oil &amp; Gas Industry and their proponents, “fracking” will provide the US with energy security, low energy prices for the foreseeable future, more than a million jobs, and economic growth. And they tell us that we can frack our way to independence without hurting the environment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Reality</strong><br/>This is nonsense. The energy abundance of the so-called ""Shale Revolution"" will be short-lived, while the environmental, economic and societal costs of this drilling frenzy will last for generations.</p>
<p>Help us expose these lies and turn the tide in the ultimate fight against greed by pre-ordering and participating in the writing and editing of Richard Heinberg's next book, <em>SNAKE OIL! How Big Energy's Promise of Plenty Imperils Our Future</em>.<br/><br/></p>
<h3>ABOUT THE AUTHOR:</h3>
<p>Richard Heinberg is the author of ten books, including <em>The End of Growth: Adapting to Our New Economic Reality</em>, <em>Peak Everything: Waking up to a Century of Declines</em> and <em>The Party's Over: Oil, War &amp; the Fate of Industrial Societies</em>. His books have been translated into 15 languages and sold over 250,000 copies. He's lectured widely around the world and is Senior Fellow at <a href=""http://www.postcarbon.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Post Carbon Institute</a>, a nonprofit think tank that recently released <a href=""http://shalebubble.org/drill-baby-drill"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this groundbreaking report</a> that exposes the fossil fuel industry's grossly exaggerated inventory and economic projections. </p>
<p><strong><em>SNAKE OIL</em> WILL BE FINISHED AND PRINTED BY JULY 1, 2013.<br/><br/></strong></p>
<h3>WHAT WE NEED:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>$5500</strong>: This small amount will cover the book's publishing costs. These include the cover art, layout, formatting, interior design, conversion to ebook and, we hope, just a smidgeon of marketing. Any additional funds will go toward putting free copies into the hands of anti-fracking activists, to equip them with powerful and unassailable arguments.   <br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Your Participation</strong>: Using the Community Engagement Model of publishing, we're inviting those interested in this hugely significant topic to weigh in as Richard's editors as he moves through the writing process. We'll also ask for your thoughts on the cover artwork and overall distribution strategy. SNAKE OIL is a print-on-demand book, meaning it will be shipped to you as soon as it's finished. <br/><br/>
</li>
</ul><h3><strong>WHAT YOU GET:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Hopefully, more than anything, a WIN. That is, a book that, like Richard's previous work, has a direct impact on public opinion, behavior and legislature. </li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Beyond that, as you'll see in the perks, we'll provide to you a special edition of the book, autographed copies, limited edition art prints and all kinds of recognition for recognizing that this is a critical fight at a critical time.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Participation: You get to help shape a book that will have a real impact.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>A copy of the book! For those who pre-order at the $20 and above mark, you'll get a limited edition ""Merry Band of Editors"" version. <br/><br/>
</li>
</ul><h3><strong>THE IMPACT:</strong></h3>
<p>This isn't a symbolic protest. Or an online call to change the world through LIKES and SHARES. No, this is a real world <em>book</em>. And historically, few human endeavors have had as much impact as the written word, especially when its put in the hands of motivated citizens out to shift the public conversation.</p>

HELP US EXPOSE BIG ENERGY'S LIES & QUITE POSSIBLY SAVE THE WORLD
 
Okay, that's a bit dramatic, but only just. The oil & gas industry is lying to you. And the consequences of these lies affect you and everyone you know. These consequences aren't esoteric, or limited to prices at the gas pump. They shape the very face of the planet and impact the quality of life of every living creature. Help us fight back against Big Energy's billion-dollar spin machine.
The Story We’re being told that – thanks to technological advances like hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling – the US is undergoing an energy revolution, leading us in a few short years to become once again the world’s biggest oil producer and an exporter of natural gas. According to the Oil & Gas Industry and their proponents, “fracking” will provide the US with energy security, low energy prices for the foreseeable future, more than a million jobs, and economic growth. And they tell us that we can frack our way to independence without hurting the environment.
 
The RealityThis is nonsense. The energy abundance of the so-called ""Shale Revolution"" will be short-lived, while the environmental, economic and societal costs of this drilling frenzy will last for generations.
Help us expose these lies and turn the tide in the ultimate fight against greed by pre-ordering and participating in the writing and editing of Richard Heinberg's next book, SNAKE OIL! How Big Energy's Promise of Plenty Imperils Our Future.
ABOUT THE AUTHOR:
Richard Heinberg is the author of ten books, including The End of Growth: Adapting to Our New Economic Reality, Peak Everything: Waking up to a Century of Declines and The Party's Over: Oil, War & the Fate of Industrial Societies. His books have been translated into 15 languages and sold over 250,000 copies. He's lectured widely around the world and is Senior Fellow at Post Carbon Institute, a nonprofit think tank that recently released this groundbreaking report that exposes the fossil fuel industry's grossly exaggerated inventory and economic projections. 
SNAKE OIL WILL BE FINISHED AND PRINTED BY JULY 1, 2013.
WHAT WE NEED:


$5500: This small amount will cover the book's publishing costs. These include the cover art, layout, formatting, interior design, conversion to ebook and, we hope, just a smidgeon of marketing. Any additional funds will go toward putting free copies into the hands of anti-fracking activists, to equip them with powerful and unassailable arguments.   


Your Participation: Using the Community Engagement Model of publishing, we're inviting those interested in this hugely significant topic to weigh in as Richard's editors as he moves through the writing process. We'll also ask for your thoughts on the cover artwork and overall distribution strategy. SNAKE OIL is a print-on-demand book, meaning it will be shipped to you as soon as it's finished. 

WHAT YOU GET:

Hopefully, more than anything, a WIN. That is, a book that, like Richard's previous work, has a direct impact on public opinion, behavior and legislature. 

Beyond that, as you'll see in the perks, we'll provide to you a special edition of the book, autographed copies, limited edition art prints and all kinds of recognition for recognizing that this is a critical fight at a critical time.

Participation: You get to help shape a book that will have a real impact.

A copy of the book! For those who pre-order at the $20 and above mark, you'll get a limited edition ""Merry Band of Editors"" version. 

THE IMPACT:
This isn't a symbolic protest. Or an online call to change the world through LIKES and SHARES. No, this is a real world book. And historically, few human endeavors have had as much impact as the written word, especially when its put in the hands of motivated citizens out to shift the public conversation.
Yes, Big Oil can outspend all of us, but they can only fool us into complacency if we let them.

<p><em>For English version please scroll down.</em><br/><br/></p>
<h2>Was ist unsere Vision?</h2>
<p>Die Energiewende zu 100% erneuerbare Energien so schnell wie möglich zu erreichen.</p>
<h2>Was ist PV-Log?</h2>
<p>PV-Log (<a href=""http://www.pv-log.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.pv-log.com</a>) ist ein freies Internetportal, welches es Solarstromproduzenten (und solchen, die es werden wollen) möglich macht, PV-Anlagen zu überwachen, miteinander zu vergleichen und mit anderen Betreibern zu kommunizieren. Mit Hilfe eines direkten Vergleichs lässt sich auf einfache Weise der Ertrag der eigenen Photovoltaik-Anlage optimieren. PV-Log ist kompetent, modern und informativ.</p>
<p>PV-Log ist ein lebendiges, schnell wachsendes, internationales Projekt mit schon heute über 1.000 registrierten Anlagen. PV-Log ist das neueste Projekt von <a href=""http://www.top50-solar.de"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Top50-Solar</a>.</p>
<h2>Wozu eine PV-Log App?</h2>
<p>PV-Log wird ständig nach den <a href=""http://hilfe.pv-log.com/forums/161625-pv-log-ideen-vorschl%C3%A4ge/filters/top"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wünschen der Nutzer</a> weiterentwickelt. Eine App ist einer der beliebtesten Feature-Wünsche der PV-Log Nutzer. Die PV-Log App soll PV-Log mobil machen, so dass jeder, auch von unterwegs die Informationen optimiert für die Darstellung auf einem Smartphone abrufen kann. Die PV-Log App soll zuerst auf Basis von HTML5 programmiert werden, so dass sie sowohl auf iPhone/iPad wie auch auf Android-Geräten funktioniert.</p>
<p>Hier schon einmal eine Idee, wie eine solche App aussehen könnte:</p>
<p><img alt=""Screenshot PV-Log App"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Xifxb0lakXY/UFGW2vE4npI/AAAAAAAAARk/vDpkwwJnnjc/s329/App-Ertrag.PNG"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Folgende Features sind für die erste Version der App geplant:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anzeige der Erträge der eigenen Anlage</li>
<li>Anzeige von Anlagenprofilen</li>
<li>Anzeige der Solar-Friends Anlagen</li>
</ul><h2>Wofür benötigen wir Deine Unterstützung?</h2>
<p>Das vom Crowdfunding erhaltene Geld werden wir für die Entwicklung der ersten Version der PV-Log App verwenden. Mit 3.000 Euro können wir eine erste Basisversion erstellen. Wir haben natürlich viele Ideen für Features. Je mehr Geld zusammen kommt und je deutlicher wir das Kampagnenziel übertreffen, desto umfangreicher können wir die App mit Funktionen ausstatten und die Website von PV-Log erweitern.</p>
<p>Aber selbst wenn Du uns nicht finanziell unterstützen kannst, dann hilfst Du uns sehr, wenn Du diese Kampagne bekannt machst: Poste darüber auf Facebook, Twitter, leite sie per Email weiter oder berichte in Deinem Blog.</p>
<h2>Warum gerade Crowdfunding und gerade jetzt?</h2>
<p>Durch die Teilnahme am <a href=""http://www.entrepreneurship.de/gruenderwettbewerb-2012/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gründergarage Wettbewerb</a> haben wir die Chance, dass Google Eure Unterstützung nochmals verdoppelt. Eine Voraussetzung ist: Wir erreichen das Crowdfundingziel von 3.000,- Euro, das sollte doch zu schaffen sein, oder? Außerdem hat das Projekt dadurch die Chance, noch mehr Aufmerksamkeit zu erhalten.</p>
<h2>Was hab ich damit zu tun?</h2>
<p>Falls Du bisher keine Photovoltaik Anlage betreibst, fragst Du Dich jetzt womöglich, was habe ich damit zu tun?</p>
<p>Man braucht keine eigene Anlage, um <a href=""http://www.pv-log.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">PV-Log</a> zu nutzen. Dadurch ist es möglich, vorab Informationen zu möglichen Erträgen einer geplanten Anlage zu erhalten. Darüber hinaus ist es vor einem Anlagenkauf ratsam, bezüglich bestimmter Produkte oder anderen Fragestellungen zum Betrieb einer PV-Anlage, Erfahrung von anderen Anwendern einzuholen. PV-Log ist also auch für alle Nutzer interessant, die sich mit dem Gedanken tragen, irgendwann in Zukunft eine Solaranlage zu installieren. Zusätzlich trägt PV-Log dazu bei, die Fortschritte bei der Energiewende sichtbar zu machen.</p>
<h2>Wer steckt dahinter?</h2>
<p>Wir sind ein junges, innovatives Team und sind davon überzeugt, dass eine weite Verbreitung der erneuerbaren Energien und eine dezentrale Energieversorgung das A und O der Zukunft unserer Erde sind.</p>
<p>Martin ist der Gründer von Top50-Solar und PV-Log. Schon seit über 15 Jahren engagiert er sich für die Solarenergie. Seine Vision für PV-Log ist, die fortschrittlichen Akteure der Energiewende effizient miteinander zu vernetzen und tolle Features für PV-Anlagenbesitzer (und solche, die es werden wollen) weltweit anzubieten.<br/> <br/>Ivonne hat Wirtschaftsinformatik an der BA in Stuttgart studiert. Sie beschäftigt sich hauptsächlich mit Support Fragen bei PV-Log und lernt immer mehr über den technischen Aspekt dieses umfangreichen Webportals. Die App erscheint ihr ein wichtiges Projekt für die Weiterentwicklung von PV-Log und die Verbreitung der Photovoltaik-Stromerzeugung weltweit.</p>
<p>Marc ist einer der Programmierer und Entwickler von PV-Log. Er hat einen Abschluss als Dipl.-Betriebswiert (FH). Seit der Anschaffung seiner ersten Photovoltaikanlage lässt ihn diese zukunftsweisende Technik nicht mehr los. Er möchte sie jedem Interessenten so transparent wie möglich machen und genau deswegen benötigen wir seiner Meinung nach die PV-Log App.</p>
<p>Desweiteren gehören zum Team Zoe, Thierry und Nicole, die uns z.B. helfen, PV-Log international zu verbreiten, das Projekt nutzerfreundlich und graphisch ansprechend zu gestalten.</p>

<h2><em>English Version</em></h2>
<h2>
<br/>Our vision</h2>
<p>To achieve the energy transition towards 100% renewable energy as soon as possible.</p>
<h2>What is PV-log?</h2>
<p>PV Log (<a href=""http://www.pv-log.com/en"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.pv-log.com</a>) is a free web portal allowing solar power operators (and those who aspire to be) to easily monitor photovoltaic systems, compare them to each other and to communicate with other solar installation operators. By directly comparing, it is easy to optimize the performance of your own photovoltaic system. PV-Log is effective, modern and informative.<br/><br/>PV-Log is a vibrant, fast-growing, international project with to date already over a 1000 registered installations. PV-Log is the latest project of <a href=""http://www.top50-solar.de/en"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Top50-Solar</a>.</p>
<h2>Why a PV-Log App?</h2>
<p>PV-Log is continuously being further developed according to the wishes of the users. Currently an App is the <a href=""http://hilfe.pv-log.com/forums/161625-pv-log-ideen-vorschl%C3%A4ge/filters/top"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">most popular feature request</a> from PV-Log users. The PV-Log App will make PV-Log mobile so that, even on the go, everyone can retrieve the information optimized for smartphone display. The first version of the PV-Log App will be programmed in HTML5, so it works on both iPhone / iPad and Android devices.<br/><br/>Here’s an idea of what the App might look like:<br/><br/></p>
<p><img alt=""Screenshot PV-Log App"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Xifxb0lakXY/UFGW2vE4npI/AAAAAAAAARk/vDpkwwJnnjc/s329/App-Ertrag.PNG"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/>The following features have been planned for the first version of the App:</p>
<ul>
<li>Display of yield data for your own installation</li>
<li>Display of installation profiles</li>
<li>Display of Solar-Friends installations</li>
</ul><h2>Why do we need your support?</h2>
<p>We will use the funds generated by this crowdfunding campaign to develop the first version of the PV-Log App. A first basic version can be created for 3.000 euros. Of course we have many ideas for additional features. The more funds we raise, the more we exceed the campaign goal, the more we will be able to provide the App and the PV-Log website with extra features.<br/><br/>But even if you can not help us financially, you would help us out a lot by helping to promote this campaign: post about it on Facebook, Twitter, forward it by email and/or blog about it.</p>
<h2>Why crowdfunding and why now?</h2>
<p>By participating in the contest of <em>Gruender-Garage</em>, we have a chance that Google doubles your contributions. A prerequisite is that we reach the crowdfunding target of 3.000, - Euro. That should be achievable, right? In addition, the campaign will give PV-Log a lot of extra media exposure.</p>
<h2>Why would I get involved?</h2>
<p>If you do not yet operate a photovoltaic system, you might possibly wonder, why you should get involved?<br/><br/>First of all you do not need to own a solar installation to use <a href=""http://www.pv-log.com/en"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">PV-Log</a>. The use of PV-Log enables you to get information on the potential production of a planned installation. Further, before buying a solar installation it is advisable to seek the experience of other users on specific products or on issues involved in operating a PV system. So PV-Log is interesting for anyone who is considering  installing a solar system at some point in the future. And last but not least, PV-Log supports the energy transition by making its progress visible. Be a part of the energy revolution by supporting the PV-Log project!</p>
<h2>Who is behind it?</h2>
<p>We are a young, innovative team and we are convinced that a wide adoption of renewable and decentralized energy production is essential for the future of our planet.<br/><br/>Martin is the founder of Top50-Solar and PV-Log. For over 15 years he has been active in the field of solar energy. His vision for PV-Log is to efficiently connect all those involved in the energy transition stage with each other and to provide PV system owners worldwide (and those who aspire to be) with great features.<br/><br/>Ivonne studied business and computer science at the vocational Academy in Stuttgart, Germany. She deals mainly with support questions at PV-Log and continuously learns more about the technical aspects of this extensive web portal. She sees the App as a significant step in the development of PV-Log and the dissemination of photovoltaic power generation worldwide.<br/><br/>Marc is one of the programmers and developers of PV-Log. He has a graduate degree in economics. Ever since acquiring his first photovoltaic system, he has been fascinated by this pioneering technology. He would like to make it as transparent as possible for anyone interested, and that's why, in his opinion, we need the PV-Log App.<br/><br/>The rest of the team is made up of Zoe, Thierry and Nicole, who help us spread PV-Log internationally, assist in making the project more user-friendly and graphically appealing.<br/><img alt=""Team"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-JDi1xcZo1Es/UFGYD4snaaI/AAAAAAAAASA/9mk0E7IUmA4/s1152/team.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

Was ist unsere Vision?
Die Energiewende zu 100% erneuerbare Energien so schnell wie möglich zu erreichen.
Was ist PV-Log?
PV-Log (www.pv-log.com) ist ein freies Internetportal, welches es Solarstromproduzenten (und solchen, die es werden wollen) möglich macht, PV-Anlagen zu überwachen, miteinander zu vergleichen und mit anderen Betreibern zu kommunizieren. Mit Hilfe eines direkten Vergleichs lässt sich auf einfache Weise der Ertrag der eigenen Photovoltaik-Anlage optimieren. PV-Log ist kompetent, modern und informativ.
PV-Log ist ein lebendiges, schnell wachsendes, internationales Projekt mit schon heute über 1.000 registrierten Anlagen. PV-Log ist das neueste Projekt von Top50-Solar.
Wozu eine PV-Log App?
PV-Log wird ständig nach den Wünschen der Nutzer weiterentwickelt. Eine App ist einer der beliebtesten Feature-Wünsche der PV-Log Nutzer. Die PV-Log App soll PV-Log mobil machen, so dass jeder, auch von unterwegs die Informationen optimiert für die Darstellung auf einem Smartphone abrufen kann. Die PV-Log App soll zuerst auf Basis von HTML5 programmiert werden, so dass sie sowohl auf iPhone/iPad wie auch auf Android-Geräten funktioniert.
Hier schon einmal eine Idee, wie eine solche App aussehen könnte:

Folgende Features sind für die erste Version der App geplant:

Anzeige der Erträge der eigenen Anlage
Anzeige von Anlagenprofilen
Anzeige der Solar-Friends Anlagen
Wofür benötigen wir Deine Unterstützung?
Das vom Crowdfunding erhaltene Geld werden wir für die Entwicklung der ersten Version der PV-Log App verwenden. Mit 3.000 Euro können wir eine erste Basisversion erstellen. Wir haben natürlich viele Ideen für Features. Je mehr Geld zusammen kommt und je deutlicher wir das Kampagnenziel übertreffen, desto umfangreicher können wir die App mit Funktionen ausstatten und die Website von PV-Log erweitern.
Aber selbst wenn Du uns nicht finanziell unterstützen kannst, dann hilfst Du uns sehr, wenn Du diese Kampagne bekannt machst: Poste darüber auf Facebook, Twitter, leite sie per Email weiter oder berichte in Deinem Blog.
Warum gerade Crowdfunding und gerade jetzt?
Durch die Teilnahme am Gründergarage Wettbewerb haben wir die Chance, dass Google Eure Unterstützung nochmals verdoppelt. Eine Voraussetzung ist: Wir erreichen das Crowdfundingziel von 3.000,- Euro, das sollte doch zu schaffen sein, oder? Außerdem hat das Projekt dadurch die Chance, noch mehr Aufmerksamkeit zu erhalten.
Was hab ich damit zu tun?
Falls Du bisher keine Photovoltaik Anlage betreibst, fragst Du Dich jetzt womöglich, was habe ich damit zu tun?
Man braucht keine eigene Anlage, um PV-Log zu nutzen. Dadurch ist es möglich, vorab Informationen zu möglichen Erträgen einer geplanten Anlage zu erhalten. Darüber hinaus ist es vor einem Anlagenkauf ratsam, bezüglich bestimmter Produkte oder anderen Fragestellungen zum Betrieb einer PV-Anlage, Erfahrung von anderen Anwendern einzuholen. PV-Log ist also auch für alle Nutzer interessant, die sich mit dem Gedanken tragen, irgendwann in Zukunft eine Solaranlage zu installieren. Zusätzlich trägt PV-Log dazu bei, die Fortschritte bei der Energiewende sichtbar zu machen.
Wer steckt dahinter?
Wir sind ein junges, innovatives Team und sind davon überzeugt, dass eine weite Verbreitung der erneuerbaren Energien und eine dezentrale Energieversorgung das A und O der Zukunft unserer Erde sind.
Martin ist der Gründer von Top50-Solar und PV-Log. Schon seit über 15 Jahren engagiert er sich für die Solarenergie. Seine Vision für PV-Log ist, die fortschrittlichen Akteure der Energiewende effizient miteinander zu vernetzen und tolle Features für PV-Anlagenbesitzer (und solche, die es werden wollen) weltweit anzubieten. Ivonne hat Wirtschaftsinformatik an der BA in Stuttgart studiert. Sie beschäftigt sich hauptsächlich mit Support Fragen bei PV-Log und lernt immer mehr über den technischen Aspekt dieses umfangreichen Webportals. Die App erscheint ihr ein wichtiges Projekt für die Weiterentwicklung von PV-Log und die Verbreitung der Photovoltaik-Stromerzeugung weltweit.
Marc ist einer der Programmierer und Entwickler von PV-Log. Er hat einen Abschluss als Dipl.-Betriebswiert (FH). Seit der Anschaffung seiner ersten Photovoltaikanlage lässt ihn diese zukunftsweisende Technik nicht mehr los. Er möchte sie jedem Interessenten so transparent wie möglich machen und genau deswegen benötigen wir seiner Meinung nach die PV-Log App.
Desweiteren gehören zum Team Zoe, Thierry und Nicole, die uns z.B. helfen, PV-Log international zu verbreiten, das Projekt nutzerfreundlich und graphisch ansprechend zu gestalten.

Our vision
To achieve the energy transition towards 100% renewable energy as soon as possible.
What is PV-log?
PV Log (www.pv-log.com) is a free web portal allowing solar power operators (and those who aspire to be) to easily monitor photovoltaic systems, compare them to each other and to communicate with other solar installation operators. By directly comparing, it is easy to optimize the performance of your own photovoltaic system. PV-Log is effective, modern and informative.PV-Log is a vibrant, fast-growing, international project with to date already over a 1000 registered installations. PV-Log is the latest project of Top50-Solar.
Why a PV-Log App?
PV-Log is continuously being further developed according to the wishes of the users. Currently an App is the most popular feature request from PV-Log users. The PV-Log App will make PV-Log mobile so that, even on the go, everyone can retrieve the information optimized for smartphone display. The first version of the PV-Log App will be programmed in HTML5, so it works on both iPhone / iPad and Android devices.Here’s an idea of what the App might look like:

The following features have been planned for the first version of the App:

Display of yield data for your own installation
Display of installation profiles
Display of Solar-Friends installations
Why do we need your support?
We will use the funds generated by this crowdfunding campaign to develop the first version of the PV-Log App. A first basic version can be created for 3.000 euros. Of course we have many ideas for additional features. The more funds we raise, the more we exceed the campaign goal, the more we will be able to provide the App and the PV-Log website with extra features.But even if you can not help us financially, you would help us out a lot by helping to promote this campaign: post about it on Facebook, Twitter, forward it by email and/or blog about it.
Why crowdfunding and why now?
By participating in the contest of Gruender-Garage, we have a chance that Google doubles your contributions. A prerequisite is that we reach the crowdfunding target of 3.000, - Euro. That should be achievable, right? In addition, the campaign will give PV-Log a lot of extra media exposure.
Why would I get involved?
If you do not yet operate a photovoltaic system, you might possibly wonder, why you should get involved?First of all you do not need to own a solar installation to use PV-Log. The use of PV-Log enables you to get information on the potential production of a planned installation. Further, before buying a solar installation it is advisable to seek the experience of other users on specific products or on issues involved in operating a PV system. So PV-Log is interesting for anyone who is considering  installing a solar system at some point in the future. And last but not least, PV-Log supports the energy transition by making its progress visible. Be a part of the energy revolution by supporting the PV-Log project!
Who is behind it?
We are a young, innovative team and we are convinced that a wide adoption of renewable and decentralized energy production is essential for the future of our planet.Martin is the founder of Top50-Solar and PV-Log. For over 15 years he has been active in the field of solar energy. His vision for PV-Log is to efficiently connect all those involved in the energy transition stage with each other and to provide PV system owners worldwide (and those who aspire to be) with great features.Ivonne studied business and computer science at the vocational Academy in Stuttgart, Germany. She deals mainly with support questions at PV-Log and continuously learns more about the technical aspects of this extensive web portal. She sees the App as a significant step in the development of PV-Log and the dissemination of photovoltaic power generation worldwide.Marc is one of the programmers and developers of PV-Log. He has a graduate degree in economics. Ever since acquiring his first photovoltaic system, he has been fascinated by this pioneering technology. He would like to make it as transparent as possible for anyone interested, and that's why, in his opinion, we need the PV-Log App.The rest of the team is made up of Zoe, Thierry and Nicole, who help us spread PV-Log internationally, assist in making the project more user-friendly and graphically appealing.

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>Hello! Thank you for visiting my campaign! My name is Lydia and I have been a dedicated student of Joanna Macy's for the past 4 years, learning practices in ecological education, community building, and group process work.  I was first introduced to Joanna while pursuing a Masters in Philosophy and Religion at the California Institute of Integral Studies. I have been deeply influenced by Joanna's work, which has helped many people learn to hold the difficult feelings that can arise from being present with the realities of our current environmental crises. This work has the ability to help us speak our truth, deepen our communities, and catalyze our willingness to show up for each other and our world.  I am also passionate about food justice and sustainable food cultivation, including permaculture practices.</p>
<h3><strong>The Project</strong></h3>
<p>I have facilitated the Work That Reconnects all over the US, and now have the incredible opportunity to go to Indonesia from February 14-28 of this year.  I will be visiting two trully amazing friends of Joanna's who have been engaged in sustainability work through the ClimateWorks Foundation as well as community building through the Samdhana Institute. Both of my hosts are also facilitators of the Work That Reconnects, and while I am there I will be engaged in training and strategy session, joining them to learn from their good works and offer my own training and gifts.  Through this kind of firsthand experience I will be able to extend my knowledge and experience of effective hands-on sustainability work. It would mean so much to me to be able to do this, and with your help it will happen!</p>

Brune, Sierra Club Executive DirectorFor me, the Gateway Nature Center has been a labor of love, but I have had a lot of support along the way. To date we have had 65 donations to the
Indiegogo campaign alone—including from many people who are new to our project! Add that to
the many  who have given in the past, and I have much to be grateful
for.Our Indiegogo campaign ends on Monday. Please consider a donation to help us reach our goal, and spread the word about
it to everyone you know who might be interested! Saving the World . . . 19 Acres at a Time
The Gateway Environmental Initiative is working to create
something new—an urban nature center less than a mile south of downtown Winston-Salem,
North Carolina. The 19-acre site we are working to buy was threatened with development
a few years ago. Since then, we have brought together neighbors, environmentalists,
families, educators, city officials, and the landowner to work toward our
goal—creating a vibrant nature center that brings children and nature together.


Our site
straddles Salem Creek. To the south is a wide-open floodplain where power lines
coexist with bird and butterfly habitat. To the north is dense woods populated
by hawks, owls, and migratory birds, as well as the occasional deer and red
fox. Nature’s power to survive in an urban setting is amazing!Why Now? Why in the City? 
In his book Last Child in the Woods,
Richard Louv eloquently describes what he calls “nature-deficit disorder.”
When children’s lives are filled with structured and technology-driven
activities at the expense of exploring nature and open-ended creative play,
cognitive and emotional development can suffer. A nature preserve and natural
playscape in the city will allow children of all backgrounds to connect with a
natural environment.The nature center we plan is unique to Winston-Salem; it will be a place where children, families, and the general public will engage with nature in an intimate way. A place where school groups will go outside to learn about nature, not from books, but from hands-on interaction with the natural world. A place where every activity, from bioremediation of toxic soils to planting bird and butterfly habitats, is a learning experience. 
While we have to stay focused on fundraising right now, we also are creating a plan for what we would like to see in a few years.

</p>
<p>As of late October 2012, the U.S. Navy is conducting a pilot program 
to recycle mattresses that are no longer usable on ships.  Currently the
 mattresses are being sent to a South Carolina company that recycles the
 springs and foam.  So far, the pilot program has involved three ships, 
including the carrier <i>USS Enterprise</i>, based in Norfolk.  
According to Gregory Jeanguenat, head of solid waste and recycling at 
the Norfolk Naval Station, the program may be expanded to other ships 
and to barracks and other Navy lodging around Norfolk.  Some Army and 
Marine bases also participate in mattress recycling.</p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p> The Navy says paying Pamplico, S.C.-based Nine Lives Mattress 
Recycling to take the Enterprise's mattresses off their hands is about 
$12,000 cheaper than paying for them to go to a local landfill.

most of these are conventional mattresses that contain man-made materials.
They‘re derived from petrochemicals and from natural gas, which are

According to an  ABC news report,
about 20 million mattresses get thrown away each year in America.
See a mattress
wont compact.  When a mattress goes to
the landfill it doesn’t go away, it doesn’t rot away, like say food waste.  It just sits there for years!  The spring steel in the mattress is some
tough stuff.  So as other waste is buried
on top of a mattress, the mattress keeps coming up, rising if you will.  Also when hospitals, universities, military

Giga Impacts Corporation is developing
the Climate Change Navigator™ and will also be offering the direct sale
of Renewable Energy products. Our website will bring together many
disparate information sources and daily news streams on Climate Change into a
framework providing actionable new knowledge on the relationship of economic activities and
their impact on Climate Change. Once our Phase I website is developed, Giga Impacts plans for immediate revenue with the sale of our energy product,  Renewable Energy
Credits or REC's. This is a key
Climate Change mitigation step everyone can participate in, which directly supports the increased use of renewable energy.

Our target customer's range from
individuals to businesses of all-sizes who are looking  to become better informed on Climate Change,
through understanding their own impacts, and educating them to take action to offset
their energy use with the purchase of renewable energy.
Meet the Leadership Team: Joel
Schatz and Chris Rathe were co-founders of Metacode Technologies, Inc., a San
Francisco enterprise software company. Where they led the development of
innovative technology with million dollar sales, and led the company through a
$150M merger with industry leader Interwoven, Inc.
Giga Impacts will be leveraging the
experience of our leadership team and the professionals in our technology
development and renewable energy sales, both focused on helping make a positive
impact on Climate Change.
Introduction
to Renewable Energy Credits (RECs)
The Chart below shows how RECs are
created by renewable energy generators, and through REC suppliers, such as Giga
Impacts, are sold to businesses and home owners with no geographic restrictions
within the United States. For every unit of green energy generated
(1 MegaWatt hour or 1 MWh or 1,000 Kilowatt hours), one renewable energy certificate (REC) is produced. Your purchase of a REC is
directly helping to build a market for renewable electricity.  The renewable energy certificates (RECs) are a product
from 100% domestic renewable Energy generation projects. They represent
unbundled renewable energy attributes that originate from green energy production;
wind, solar, biomass or small-scale hydro.



There is no need to switch electricity
providers when you buy a renewable energy certificate. Your home or business continues
to receive your electricity from your existing utility. 
Your purchase is real. All RECs from Giga Impacts will be
verified by Green-e Energy, an independent consumer protection program
providing certification for renewable energy sold to households and
organizations.  See Green-e.org

<h2>Hello, </h2> <p>We are Rez-Cycling at the Salish Kootenai College (SKC) located in Pablo, Montana.  We created this recycling campaign to kick-start recycling for SKC tribal students. The College is only our start-up, we have plans to create change throughout the community to help better the environment. </p>
<p>Recycling helps protect our resources, our environment, and our quality of life.</p>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The Rez-Cycling campaign is focusing on the importance of the recycling systems on Tribal reservations. Tribal people want to do their part for the care of the environment, but it can be difficult to understand the knowledge of ‘How to recycle.'</p>
<p>Rez-cycling anticipates to access and expand to recycle and to enhance educational aspects to kick-start the recycling venture along with the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes and Tribal College. </p>
<p>SKC has 55 student family houses and 2 separate dormitories that are in need of your contribution.</p>
<p>With your donation, Tribal College students will have the opportunity to begin new Eco-friendly projects that help alleviate the transition to modern waste management. </p>
<p><i><strong>#dontbetrashy #onerezatatime  #cyclecontinues</strong></i></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need your donation today for recycling bins &amp; machines for breaking down plastics. We have a time limit on our campaign, every donation helps!</p>
<p>Target Goal: $ 15,000</p>
<p>55 housing units and two (2) separate dormitories.</p>
<p>Goal - 80 indoor bins, 9 collection bins, 10 sorting bins, 2 recycling machines (Shredder and Compressor)  </p>
<p>The funding for the Rez-cycling will go towards purchasing two machines (shredder and extruder) which allows #1- #10 plastics to be shredded and composed into a thread of new plastic. </p>
<p>Also, three tier stackable recycling bins for inside our two (2) SKC student dorms, all family housing units, as well as outside in the family housing parking lots, and for the last step of sorting the collection of #1 - #10 plastics.</p>
<p><strong>SKC says Thank you! </strong></p>
<p>We appreciate our donors, not only are you helping the environment, you are sustaining recycling for generations to come at the Salish Kootenai College, as we charge into the future!</p>
<p>Your donation will receive a customized perk with Rez-cyclers Logo. </p>
<p>  <strong><u><i>Personalized with recycling logo:</i></u></strong></p>
<p>  Tier 1         Shout out on Facebook: when donating $5</p>
<p>  Tier 2        Decal/Sticker: when donating $25</p>
<p>  Tier 3        Shirt: when donating $50</p>
<p>  Tier 4        Hydro Flask: when donating $100</p>
<p>  Tier 5        Desk bin with campaign logo: when donating $500</p>
<p>  Tier 6        Native American beaded item: when donating $1,000</p> <p><strong>Where do the funds go if we do not reach our goal?</strong></p>
<p>Our first priority for any funding gained through Rez-cycling’s campaign will go towards the purchasing of recycling bins for collection and sorting efforts.</p>
<p>Reaching our first target goal for the recycling campaign is at SKC student dorms &amp; family housing units by having accessible bins within the area for on-campus students. However, if the target goal isn’t met, the funds will be used towards marketing materials that provide educational awareness on how to properly recycle plastic items.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your donation today will kick-start an extensive first-ever recycling program for SKC campus student family housing. Salish Kootenai College is located on the Flathead Indian Reservation, approximately 1,317,000 acres. In addition, the efforts from your donation will help carryon the project with the community around SKC and sustain recycling efforts for generations to come. This is an opportunity of a lifetime, for students to be able to finally start recycling, by donors like you, who provide resources students need. </p>
<p>The impact of this project is extensive. Since, we are starting up a recycling program for the Salish Kootenai College Student Housing, we are raising money to create an opportunity to expand around the SKC community to make a difference in the lives of our community and the communities of the students they go home to after college.</p>
<p>Rez-cycling Objectives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Raise money through the Indiegogo campaign for the SKC Student housing and dormitories and overall campus.</li>
<li>Raise awareness to create a better understanding of 'how to recycle'.</li>
<li>Your donations will help us provide recycling bins to all students who live in the SKC Dormitories &amp; Family Units.</li>
<li>Your donation will help donors with good quality Rez-Cyclying merchandise. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The #1 risk is starting this campaign so that we can eventually transition with other recycling projects on the Flathead Indian Reservation and Lake County. We anticipate to take on every internal and external obstacle to implement such a huge change within only 7 weeks of student planning. </p>
<p>Our biggest challenge here is, we need the final funding to execute our campaign. Our campus is overflowing with eager students who want to recycle; however, our campus is 128 acres: students need recycling bins. </p>
<p>The <i>risks and challenges</i> of accomplishing our goals are being able to raise enough funds to get equipment. Our number one priority is the equipment.  The equipment provides the resources to continue our goal of recycling. </p>
<p><u><i><strong>Why recycle?</strong></i></u></p>
<p>We are overcoming pollution and waste through innovation and promotional efforts. The risk we face is that our efforts may be in vain. We are exploring avenues of effectiveness in our endeavors. We are currently sourcing departments within our college community. We are also coming up with innovative ways to utilize plastics.</p>
<p>We are brainstorming and constantly researching and looking into new ways of utilizing recycled materials. One of the ways we are considering is 3D printing recyclable materials. We are communicating with the community, promoting awareness as well as providing points of access to recycle waste materials. We would like to become a part of a global organization to share ideas as well as become a part of a movement, a global effort to nurture this world we care about so dearly. We would like your help to make a better recycling environment.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Our main goal is to create a recycling environment on the SKC campus, but that does not mean that we don’t want to grow and expand outside of just the College.</p>
<p>Rez-Cycling wants to spread awareness throughout the area so that we can influence our fellow community members to join us in creating a healthier environment.</p>
