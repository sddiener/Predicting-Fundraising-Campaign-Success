and taught in a wide range of performances in Vermont, New Hampshire, Maryland,
and North Carolina. She found her love for dance at Contemporary Dance and
Fitness Studio (CD&amp;FS) in Montpelier where she received her early training.
After high school Kiera went on to Goddard College and earned a BA in
Choreography and Dance Pedagogy. Throughout her dance career, Kiera has trained
in a wide range of styles from ballet and modern to hip-hop and stepping and
has dabbled in other forms of movement, such as capoeira, salsa, and zouk. Kiera
currently choreographs and performs around Vermont and is the founder and
director of the Sauter Dance Collective, a small dance company based in
Vermont. <i>Subluxation: A Partial
Dislocation,</i> and <i>Braving the Cold;
Creating Some Heat </i>are the two most recent shows which Kiera choreographed
and produced for the Sauter Dance Collective. Kiera was recently selected as a
choreographer for the Charlotte New Music Festival setting works on Pilobolus,
Sean Currin, and Sterling Dance Company dancers. Additionally, she runs a youth
choreography mentoring program for middle and high school students, as well as
works as administrative assistant and teacher at CD&amp;FS. Outside of dance, Kiera
spends her time working on a wide variety of collaborations with other art
forms, as well as cross training and learning about injury prevention and
rehabilitation. </p>

in Montpelier, VT where she met and danced with Kiera Sauter. Summers were
spent studying at the Bates Dance Festival, Alvin Ailey Summer School and Dance
New Amsterdam, training equally in ballet and modern dance. Following high school Isadora attend New York University, Tish

</h3><p>Jessica meets Will and they are immediately attracted to each other. Summer passes by and the new school year
starts--which means the start of infatuation, secrets, jealousy and a roller
coaster of a relationship. ""Be With Me"" explores the dynamics of young
love--all-consuming and ultimately devastating. We are the uncomfortable
witnesses as we watch Jessica and Will spiral downward into self-destructive
darkness.</p>
<p>We are premiering ""Be With
Me"" at the 2014 Vancouver Fringe Festival.  It will be running from
September 5th-14th at the Cultch on Venables Street and will feature the recorded music of Vancouver's  rising musical stars, The Belle Game!</p>
<p><b>Who We Are</b></p>
<p>

<p>She grew up on the North Shore and attended Vanleena Dance
Academy where she studied ballet, tap, jazz, hip-hop, and lyrical dance. She is
a graduate of Capilano University’s Musical Theatre Program and has appeared

(Fringe, 2013). She has also choreographed student musicals (<i>Alice in Wonderland, Aladdin, The Little
Mermaid, Guys and Dolls</i>) for the Lindberg Academy where she teaches musical
theatre and is the coordinator of the EPIC Program.</p>
<p>Liz’s ultimate goal is to establish a small company that
will bring edgy alternative theatre and dance to the Vancouver stage.  </p><p>
</p><p><b>The Belle Game: Music.</b></p>
<p><i>The Belle Game</i> take
intricate guitar and keyboard lines, anchored by dark pop rhythms, and weave
them into gorgeous, graceful melodies. The Canadian indie authority <i>Exclaim!</i> describes their music as “indie-rock
at its best: texturally layered, with echoing guitars, infectious rhythms and
horns, and lavished in hooks.”</p><p></p><p><b>Cory Haas: Director.</b></p><p>
</p><p>Cory is an actor, director, and a little bit of everything
else in between. He is a recent graduate of Capilano University from where he

two primary characters.</p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>This is first show that Liz has written and produced. She is hoping that it will be the first of many and will inspire others to bring their work to not only the Fringe but to all

<br/></div>","Jessica meets Will and they are immediately attracted to each other. Summer passes by and the new school year
starts--which means the start of infatuation, secrets, jealousy and a roller
coaster of a relationship. ""Be With Me"" explores the dynamics of young
love--all-consuming and ultimately devastating. We are the uncomfortable
witnesses as we watch Jessica and Will spiral downward into self-destructive
darkness.
We are premiering ""Be With
Me"" at the 2014 Vancouver Fringe Festival.  It will be running from
September 5th-14th at the Cultch on Venables Street and will feature the recorded music of Vancouver's  rising musical stars, The Belle Game!
Who We Are


Liz Maillard: Writer,
Producer, and Actor (Jessica)
Liz Maillard is at the early stage of her career as a playwright,
producer, director, and choreographer. 
She grew up on the North Shore and attended Vanleena Dance
Academy where she studied ballet, tap, jazz, hip-hop, and lyrical dance. She is
a graduate of Capilano University’s Musical Theatre Program and has appeared
recently as Baby Bear in Shrek, the
Musical (Align Entertainment). She was the assistant choreographer for Cabaret (Pipedream) and was the
choreographer for Scotch and Chocolate

Mermaid, Guys and Dolls) for the Lindberg Academy where she teaches musical
theatre and is the coordinator of the EPIC Program.
Liz’s ultimate goal is to establish a small company that
will bring edgy alternative theatre and dance to the Vancouver stage.  
The Belle Game: Music.
The Belle Game take
intricate guitar and keyboard lines, anchored by dark pop rhythms, and weave
them into gorgeous, graceful melodies. The Canadian indie authority Exclaim! describes their music as “indie-rock
at its best: texturally layered, with echoing guitars, infectious rhythms and
horns, and lavished in hooks.”Cory Haas: Director.

Sound of Music (Gateway Theatre); Erica Snodge in Riverview High: The Musical (Entrance Theatre); Young “Little” Edie
in Grey Gardens (FCP); Cinderella in Cinderella (Exit 22). She was honoured
at the 2011 Ovation Awards with the Most Outstanding Newcomer Award.Linzi Voth: Stage Manager.
Linzi is a multifaceted
performing arts addict and takes turns being a stage manager, dancer, singer, actor,
theatre instructor, and choreographer. She has a Bachelor of Performing Arts
Degree and Musical Theatre Diploma from Capilano University and has appeared in
VanDeca Choir–Alto (Evolution of Music Concert June 7th); Carrie (Fighting Chance, Fringe); Spring Awakening (Fighting Chance, Fringe); Cabaret (Pipedream); Magic to
Do (ITP/WRS Productions); Mrs. Claus’
Kitchen (Famous Artists); Cocktails
at Pam’s (Staircase XI); Made of
Stone (Prohibition Theatre); Model
Wanted (Friendly Haters); The Last
Piece, Vic & Jack (Little Basket); We
Are Three Sisters (United Players); Assassins
(Pipedream); Qualia (Push). Linzi has
also performed with Gateway, Royal City, TUTS and Metro. She works with
children who have autism. Stefano Casadei: Actor (Will).
Stefano is a local actor, writer, and director. Though having
worked mostly in film and television, he has always had a passion for the
stage. With the production of Be With Me,
he now will be able to make his theatre debut as Will Anderson, one of the play’s
two primary characters.
The Impact

<p><b>'Murder', a tragedy in three acts and an epilogue, was written in 1995 by the late Israeli playwright Hanoch Levin. It portrays the Israeli-Palestinian endless cycle of violence and revenge. This play is not about sides, it is about people everywhere and the monstrous brutality they are capable of. More So, it is about how people do not change. When the current war in Israel and Gaza dies down, what then? Will we stick to violence and hate or will we finally give peace a chance? This timeless and universal play is a cry for change.</b></p>
<p>Levin was an extraordinary playwright. He had a way of creating the ugliest situations and characters through the funniest, most poetic language. We are proud to introduce his work to more people and have this outstanding play be our company's first production.  </p>

<h3>What are The Minty Awards?</h3>
<p>The Minty Awards was founded in 2010 as a way to recognize the students of the Performing Arts Programs of the Catholic High Schools on Staten Island. </p>
<ul>
<li>We look to uphold the tradition to honor the talents of the performers while promoting their schools, their dramatic arts programs, faith and all who support them.</li>
<li>We believe that these students and schools provide excellent examples of self- discipline, teamwork, and talent that their families, friends, and community should celebrate.</li>
<li>We also value a good Catholic education, believing that it instills morals and principles these students carry with them after they have left high school.</li>
</ul>
<p>The 2013 Minty Awards will be on <strong>Saturday, June 8 at 7pm</strong> at the historic St. George Theatre!</p>
<p>In the past two years, we have <strong>donated close to $10,000</strong> to the Catholic High Schools. Last year, over 800 people attended The Minty Awards at the majestic and historic St. George Theatre.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>As in the past, half of our income from ticket sales will go to the school which receives the St. Gensius Award for Outstanding Musical. However, this year we are trying to cover all our costs through sponsorships and ads, so that every penny we make from ticket sales will go to EACH participating school! By contributing to The Minty Awards, you are helping us come closer to that goal of <strong>giving back to every Catholic high school</strong> on Staten Island!</p>
<p>We're also offering great deals and prizes based on your contribution level!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The Minty Awards is a unique event for the Staten Island community:</p>

<p> </p></div>","What are The Minty Awards?
The Minty Awards was founded in 2010 as a way to recognize the students of the Performing Arts Programs of the Catholic High Schools on Staten Island. 

We look to uphold the tradition to honor the talents of the performers while promoting their schools, their dramatic arts programs, faith and all who support them.
We believe that these students and schools provide excellent examples of self- discipline, teamwork, and talent that their families, friends, and community should celebrate.
We also value a good Catholic education, believing that it instills morals and principles these students carry with them after they have left high school.

The 2013 Minty Awards will be on Saturday, June 8 at 7pm at the historic St. George Theatre!
In the past two years, we have donated close to $10,000 to the Catholic High Schools. Last year, over 800 people attended The Minty Awards at the majestic and historic St. George Theatre.


What We Need & What You Get
As in the past, half of our income from ticket sales will go to the school which receives the St. Gensius Award for Outstanding Musical. However, this year we are trying to cover all our costs through sponsorships and ads, so that every penny we make from ticket sales will go to EACH participating school! By contributing to The Minty Awards, you are helping us come closer to that goal of giving back to every Catholic high school on Staten Island!
We're also offering great deals and prizes based on your contribution level!


The Impact
The Minty Awards is a unique event for the Staten Island community:

It is the only event of its kind on Staten Island.
It has been attended by dignataries from all members of the New York community: Archdiocean officials, Elected officials, Tony Award winning actors, civic leaders
Last year, over 800 family and friends gathered at the St. George Theatre, with the excitement building up for this year's event, we are looking to surpass 1000 attendees!

Greetings!  Welcome to the FATHERS OF THE DARK KNIGHT” indiegogo.com fund-raising campaign!  This is a non-profit full-length stage play featuring an all-Drama Student cast!  The play is targeted to premiere in the early fall (October) of 2013, on the campus of a Bronx, NY university.  A short run of five (5) performances of this theatrical event will be presented for the benefit of the surrounding community, and BATMAN / comic book industry fans near and far!  Log on to  www.fathersofthedarkknight.com for an in-depth look at the production!

 
THE PLAY
In March of 1939, an ambitious, young comic strip artist by the name of Robert Kahn was presented with an exciting and life-changing opportunity.  Vince Sullivan, the Editor and Publisher of National Periodicals Publications (known today as DC Comics), was trying to come up with another super-hero sensation to match the success of the recently debuted SUPERMAN.  Sullivan called Kahn into his office and presented him with the challenge of creating just such a character. Motivated by the lure of a lucrative weekly paycheck and steady employment, Robert (working under the pseudonym of  “BOB KANE”) spent the following year collaborating with his writing partner BILL FINGER and artist JERRY ROBINSON to create the Caped Crusader of Gotham City… THE BATMAN!

From his very first appearance in the May issue of Detective Comics (issue #27), the character was an instant success!  Having shrewdly negotiated a deal retaining half ownership of what would ultimately become a world-wide, multi-media sensation, Bob Kane went on to become a very wealthy celebrity artist over the following decades. But behind the scenes, The Batman’s comic strip success was bitter-sweet.  While Kane enjoyed the sweetness of fame and notoriety, The Dark Knight mythology co-creators Bill Finger and Jerry Robinson saw mostly the bitterness.

How could this happen? How was it that Finger was never given the proper credit nor financial reward for his substantial role in the creation of the iconic Batman mythology?  Why did Kane refuse to give Robinson his deserved credit for his conceptualization of The Joker or for his design contributions for Robin The Boy Wonder?  In the stage production of “FATHERS OF THE DARK KNIGHT”,you will learn the answers to these burning questions, and so much more!  Set in Bob Kane’s studio apartment in The Bronx, circa 1939 and beyond, this ambitious theatrical drama is designed to play out on one half of the performance stage.  Here, you will witness the dramatic, humorous, and informative real-life creative process undergone by this intrepid trio as they flesh-out characters and build the fictional world of The Batman’s Gotham City!
But equally compelling will be the action playing out on the second half of the stage, where each fantasy character and environment developed by Kane, Finger, and Robinson excitingly comes to life before your very eyes!  You will be delighted by a live, gothic spectacle of sights and sounds, as classic comic book heroes battle the most terrible villains for the very soul of Gotham City!
As biographical drama meets fantasy adventure, you too will agree that “FATHERS OF THE DARK KNIGHT” is a stunning theatrical achievement!
PLAYWRIGHT, PRODUCER, AND DIRECTOR
Overseeing this entire production as Playwright, Producer and Director is NYC Department of Education-registered Teaching Artist Roberto Williams.  With over 25 years of professional experience as a stage performer in New York City, Mr. Williams has enjoyed several careers in the arts, and now brings his passion for entertainment to his many performing arts student.
Having already written, produced, and directed numerous school presentations, Mr. Williams now embarks upon his most ambitious showcase of student talent to date:  The dramatic stage production of  “FATHERS OF THE DARK KNIGHT”!
Initially conceived of as a small high school production in October of 2011, Mr. Williams has steadily transformed the scope and scale of “FATHERS OF THE DARK KNIGHT” into something that will become the new standard of excellence in student-produced theater.  For the sake of maintaining full creative control, and total faithfulness to the classic comic book source material, this production has been moved out of the (often confining) parameters of the school system, and is being produced independently. 
Each student will be instilled with an invaluable sense of artistic pride and ownership from their involvement in this enterprise.  And this sprawling real-life tale of three poor boys from the Bronx who create an iconic, American mythology will serve as powerful inspiration to the production’s youthful cast, crew, and audience.
With The Batman mythology at the center of this production, a life-long dream  to create this gothic world on stage will be realized by playwright / director Williams and his excited students!
On a personal note, Mr. Williams feels that it is absolutely vital for disadvantaged inner city students to have ambitious artistic opportunities like “FATHERS OF THE DARK KNIGHT” provided to them as often as possible. This need is particularly urgent now in the wake of yearly public school budget cuts to Arts-in-Education programs nationwide.

<p>In partnership with Rhythm &amp; Motion and ODC, Latin Dance Grooves is preparing our 5<sup>th</sup> annual award-winning San Francisco Carnaval parade contingent. Our 2013 contingent theme is ""Un Mosaico de Movimiento: Many Cultures, One People"". We have over 100 dancers participating in our contingent, and we need your help in generating the funds to support their amazing work and dancing!</p>
<h3><strong>What is Latin Dance Grooves?</strong></h3>
<p>Latin Dance Grooves, created in 2008 by Elizabeth Soberanes, is a vibrant dance class and community that explores the sensual art of Latin dance! Taught by Elizabeth Soberanes and Bianca Coleman, our Latin Dance Grooves classes have developed a huge multi-generational community of dancers. With respect and integrity, Elizabeth and Bianca incorporate traditional dances such as Afro-Cuban, Rumba, and Afro-Brazilian, as a way of demonstrating the connection between traditional and popular dance. The goal is to help students develop an understanding and awareness of the cultural context of the diverse, sophisticated and complex rhythms of Latin dance. Additional guest artists helping with our parade contingent this year are Javier Gordillo Robles (guest choreographer from Peru), Regina “Califa” Calloway (guest artist instructor), Eyla Moore (rehearsal asst.), Shawn Peltier (make-up/hair design), Van Nguyen-Stone (videographer/film-maker), and Wendy Louise Miller (costumer).</p>
<h3><strong>What is SF Carnaval?</strong></h3>
<p>San Francisco’s Carnaval festival blossomed from its inception in Precita Park in the Mission District 35 years ago. Its growth and development is attributable to the passion of its founding members who longed for the traditional Carnaval celebrations of their native homelands. Those founding members were composed of people from many cultures, and walks of life ranging from musicians, dancers, artists and a host of local residents that saw the joy and happiness that came when they gathered in this multicultural celebration. Every year, the festival and parade draw hundreds of thousands of people for two days of dancing Salsa, Samba, Reggae, Tango, Hip- Hop, Merengue, Calypso, Cha Cha Cha, Cumbia, and Mambo into the evening. In addition to the parade, the Carnaval festival has vendors, arts &amp; crafts, music, and activities for adults and children. The 2013 parade will take place on Sunday, May 26.</p>
<h3><strong>How will your contribution help?</strong></h3>
<p>While the dancers pay for their parade rehearsals and costumes, there are still many costs to putting our contingent together. We have a lot of ground to cover to get everything together for parade day. We would love to support our dancers with a gorgeous float, high quality sound system, food/supplies for a celebratory after-parade event and airfare to fly our special guest artist, Javier Gordillo, back from Peru to participate in the parade with us!</p>
<h3><strong>What do you get for contributing?</strong></h3>
<p>We want to bring you as close as we can to our community and parade experience. From free classes to a fully produced contingent DVD, our perks are designed to share our love and joy in Latin Dance Grooves and SF Carnaval. Our colorful list of perks can be found to the right on this page. As ODC is the fiscal sponsor for our contingent and a 501(c)3 non-profit organization, all donations (after value of perks received) are tax-deductible!</p>
<h3><strong>Other ways you can help …</strong></h3>
<p>Of course, we'd love for you to give to the campaign, but understand that not everyone is able to. If you can't, here are some other ways you can help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Forward our campaign to your family and friends</li>
<li>Volunteer to help us on parade day</li>
<li>Come see the parade and cheer us on!</li>

We have over 100 dancers participating in our contingent, and we need your help in generating the funds to support their amazing work and dancing!
What is Latin Dance Grooves?
Latin Dance Grooves, created in 2008 by Elizabeth Soberanes, is a vibrant dance class and community that explores the sensual art of Latin dance! Taught by Elizabeth Soberanes and Bianca Coleman, our Latin Dance Grooves classes have developed a huge multi-generational community of dancers. With respect and integrity, Elizabeth and Bianca incorporate traditional dances such as Afro-Cuban, Rumba, and Afro-Brazilian, as a way of demonstrating the connection between traditional and popular dance. The goal is to help students develop an understanding and awareness of the cultural context of the diverse, sophisticated and complex rhythms of Latin dance. Additional guest artists helping with our parade contingent this year are Javier Gordillo Robles (guest choreographer from Peru), Regina “Califa” Calloway (guest artist instructor), Eyla Moore (rehearsal asst.), Shawn Peltier (make-up/hair design), Van Nguyen-Stone (videographer/film-maker), and Wendy Louise Miller (costumer).
What is SF Carnaval?
San Francisco’s Carnaval festival blossomed from its inception in Precita Park in the Mission District 35 years ago. Its growth and development is attributable to the passion of its founding members who longed for the traditional Carnaval celebrations of their native homelands. Those founding members were composed of people from many cultures, and walks of life ranging from musicians, dancers, artists and a host of local residents that saw the joy and happiness that came when they gathered in this multicultural celebration. Every year, the festival and parade draw hundreds of thousands of people for two days of dancing Salsa, Samba, Reggae, Tango, Hip- Hop, Merengue, Calypso, Cha Cha Cha, Cumbia, and Mambo into the evening. In addition to the parade, the Carnaval festival has vendors, arts & crafts, music, and activities for adults and children. The 2013 parade will take place on Sunday, May 26.
How will your contribution help?
While the dancers pay for their parade rehearsals and costumes, there are still many costs to putting our contingent together. We have a lot of ground to cover to get everything together for parade day. We would love to support our dancers with a gorgeous float, high quality sound system, food/supplies for a celebratory after-parade event and airfare to fly our special guest artist, Javier Gordillo, back from Peru to participate in the parade with us!
What do you get for contributing?
We want to bring you as close as we can to our community and parade experience. From free classes to a fully produced contingent DVD, our perks are designed to share our love and joy in Latin Dance Grooves and SF Carnaval. Our colorful list of perks can be found to the right on this page. As ODC is the fiscal sponsor for our contingent and a 501(c)3 non-profit organization, all donations (after value of perks received) are tax-deductible!

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><strong>Why Do This</strong><br/>This play was written in response to the earthquake of January 12, 2010 that shook southern Haiti and my complete disgust at a television preacher who said God is punishing Haiti because of the Voudo religion.

After the initial well-spring of dramatic rescues, and aid from abroad, the media coverage receded and Haiti went out of sight and it seemed out of mind.

The Project
This play is called Cowardice of Eyes. This theatrical piece seeks to bring congruency between how the world views Haitians and how the people of Haiti see themselves. The play deals with three elements of Haitian life: history, politics, and religion, presented through informative and penetrating dialogue, imbued with magical realism, music and dance. We will bring the richness of Haitian life to you. Their struggle, triumphs, all brought to the surface for those who are willing to witness it.
Why Do ThisThis play was written in response to the earthquake of January 12, 2010 that shook southern Haiti and my complete disgust at a television preacher who said God is punishing Haiti because of the Voudo religion. Having grown up in the region my heart broke at the ignorance and ill will this supposed man of God was spreading.
The magnitude of this disaster will last decades. The quake registered 7.0 on the Richter scale; the most powerful to hit Haiti in 200 years. The epicenter of the quake, just ten miles from Haiti's capital, Port -Au-Prince, suffered the full brunt of the devastation leaving the government unable to control the situation or mobilize their resources. Countries quickly sent aid, the initial response was great. The media ran many stories of stunning rescues of adults and children pulled from the rubble, some with crushed limbs, broken bones, and amputations in the days, weeks, and months that followed.

Occasionally there would be some stories about some form of abuse by Peace Keepers, an outbreak of cholera, and aid workers feasting on American cuisine in restaurants just a stone's throw from camps full of homeless and starving Haitians.
 
With Cowardice of Eyes, we will keep the plight of Haiti in the minds and hearts of people of the world. While aid has helped the region, I believe understanding the culture of our neighbors to the south will help to change the misinformed and misguided understanding of this complex culture.

The Impact
By supporting the Valjean Friday Night Film Festival you help inspire more filmmakers to submit to festivals.  Festivals are a great approach to get your content out to the public. It takes more than just an ideal; you have to take action and must have determination to finish. VFNFF prepares first time filmmakers with a few guidelines enabling a smooth submission process.  The filmmaker gains positive feedback from the audience during Q & A.  Talking in front of the audience is essential, think of it as practice for your speech, especially when ready to pitch your project.  What better place than the VFNFF to screen your talent amongst others in an encouraging environment? 
Thinking of another way to help?
If you don’t have funds to help, please spread the word by sharing, using various Internet tools.  We all know how much every little bit helps.  And I look forward to supporting you in the future.",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

Dedicated to exploring new work, FRESH PRODUCE'd unites playwrights, actors, and directors to bring the page to the stage through risk, growth, and play. </h3>
<p> </p>
<p><span>Founded in May of 2012 by a group of 10 theatre artists, FRESH PRODUCE’d performs 3 new short plays on the 3rd Thursday of every month at the Arthur Seelen Theater in The Drama Book Shop. FP has grown a lot in its first year, producing 33 fresh-picked plays and collaborating with more than 100 artists. Now we need your help to expand our monthly workshop series into our vision for our second year: professional rehearsal space and free participation for our expanding network of writers, actors, and directors.</span></p>
<p>At FP, our writers are the focus of our process. We welcome works in all phases of development, and we work closely with the writers to tailor the Thursday performances to the needs of their plays, from staged readings, to modestly-staged productions. This year we’ve helped to promote the work of dozens of playwrights from New York City and beyond, including Boston, San Francisco, Houston, and Canada. In addition to their work with FP, our writer-collaborators have had readings and work presented at Ars Nova, the Public Theater, and MCC Theater at the Lucille Lortel Theater, to name a few. Additionally, we produced three readings of playwright Brett Dalton’s FOOTPRINTS IN THE SNOW for Broadway League producers and we were selected by a Huffington Post contributor as one of her top theater companies in New York City in 2012, alongside the Public Theater, Playwrights Horizons and The Wooster Group.</p>
<p>And now we’re bi-coastal! Founding Producer Riva Di Paola forged westward, beginning the Los Angeles branch now in residence at the The Other Space Theater at The Actors Company. We’re excited to bring a whole new crop of Freshies into the bunch, and do some cross-coastal pollination.</p>
<p>But every pineapple plant needs water to grow. And it’s springtime at The Drama Book Shop. Every month, our core cast and guest playwrights chip in to rent the wonderful Arthur Seelen Theater for the evening. It is our goal to offer free participation for all! We need your support in order to make this possible.</p>
<p><span>Also, thus far, we’ve been using our apartments as stand-in rehearsal rooms. Our artists have been kind enough to commute from Washington Heights to the Village to Astoria in order to rehearse in cast members’ apartments. Our hosts’ kindnesses will never be forgotten, and our Freshies have had the opportunity to explore all of the corners of the city. However not every play benefits from an overly-friendly kitty bouncing in during the intense climax. We’d love the opportunity to offer professional rehearsal studios to our artists. We’ve really bloomed over the last year, and free participation and proper rehearsal space will provide us with the opportunity to flourish!</span></p>
<p>FRESH PRODUCE’d has thrived in Year 1, and we’re hungry to see what Year 2 brings to the table!  Help us to continue to freshly produce exciting, unique plays, and to make this year even better than the last.

<p> </p></div>","Cecily and Gwendolyn's Fantastical... is an ongoing, ever-evolving, audience-generated and driven, improvisational theater/social science experiment.
Theater artists and veteran improvisers, Kelly A. Jennings and Karen Getz, are Cecily Marlborough and Gwendolyn Hamm: Time-Traveling Victorian Social Anthropologists completing their study on the history of human culture. Gathering missing data on 21st Century cultures, they run a series of Fantasticals... subject-driven, anthropological field studies framed as ""audience-interactive theater.”  In these, willingly gathered test-subject audiences engage in an empirical look at American life through a decidedly Victorian Lens; unearthing the absurd, incredible, often gobsmackingly wondrous elements of our unexamined, everyday lives.
Hoping to observe how this democratic society works, The Fantastical… will spend 2012 traversing the USA, diving under the waves of vitriol spewing from its mass media to meet actual Americans.  The Fantastical American Anthropological Inquisitorial Probe (and world domination tour)  will land at The Phoenix, Cincinnati, St. Louis, D.C., Minneapolis, Boulder, Philadelphia and, possibly, New Orleans, Fringe Festivals.  Within the instant, joyful communities formed at each Fantastical…Cec and Gwen hope to uncover the mechanisms of a functioning (?) 21st Century, Democratic Society “ through it's unique and fascinating citizens. In December, Cec and Gwen will share their findings in series Fantastical Symposiums…at their Earth base camp in Philadelphia.

 WHO WE ARE AND WHY WE DO WHAT WE DO
Karen Getz and Kelly Jennings are professional theater artists who work within the conventional and devised theater communities of Philadelphia. They are both actors, makers, directors, producers, teaching artists and passionate, long-form improvisers.
 
They began working together in 1994 as company members of Comedysportz Philadelphia, ran Tapestry Theater (work for and by women who dare!) from From 1997-2005, produced The Annual Female Funnyfest from 1999-2002 and were 2/5's of the revered and beloved Philly Long-form ensemble, Lunchlady Dorisˆ, from 1997 until it folded in 2009.
 
Inspired by the ensemble-based, character-driven work they were doing in Doris and anxious to take the work further, they set their sites on a fearless, fourth-wall-free, completely improvised, audience generated and integrated, two-person show. The first of these was Killer Pussy, a Super-Hero, Audience-Interactive, Action-Adventure, played throughout the house. Premiering at The 2006 Philly Fringe Festival, Jennings and Getz continued to explore the format the Philly's SPARK, Improv and Fringe festivals.
 
The characters of Cecily and Gwendolyn made their first appearance during a Killer Pussy show and kept creeping into the work, demanding to be heard. Karen and Kelly finally acquiesced to the these slightly mad Victorian women in early 2008 and Cecily and Gwendolyn’s Fantastical.... was born. Debuting at the 2008 Philly Fringe, The Fantastical...garnered critical acclaim and a devout fan base with runs at The Philadelphia Improv Festival, Two Philadelphia SPARK Festivals, The 2009 Philadelphia Fringe Festival, The 2010 Philadelphia Second City show at PTC , two Philadelphia Joke Initiative Produced runs (2009 and 2010),  The 2011 Capital Fringe Festival and The 2012 Phoenix Fringe Festival, this past March.
 
In addition to their work as actors, directors and makers and their blind and proudly geeky obsession with all things Victorian, British, Science, Science-fiction and Socio/Anthropological, Kelly is a teaching artist for The Philadelphia Shakespeare Festival and a revered improv ensemble coach. Karen is 3x Barrymore award-winning choreographer and the creator of 3 original, comic-actors’ ballets (Suburban Love Songs, Disco Descending and The A.I. Project.) At the very moment of this writing, Kelly is directing The Music Man just outside of Philly and Karen is choreographing Dessa Rose in Richmond, Va.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>We are bringing our show to New York and we need your help to put it up!</p>
<p>DUELING HARPS is an elegant night of music and antics created by performers Ann Magnuson , Adam Dugas, harpists Alexander Rannie and Mia Theodoratus, and the puppeteer Robin Walsh. Our show runs October 14, 15 and 16, 2010 at the Abrons Arts Center located in New York City’s Lower East Side.</p>
<p>This is a fun and unique show of music and performance and these kinds of things only happen with independent backing. Here's how we pitch it: A darkly elegant evening of gorgeous melodies with a theatrical flourish. Ann Magnuson and Adam Dugas face off on vocals as Alexander Rannie and Mia Theodoratus strum their harps in this twisted match of musical one-upmanship. The quartet thrusts and parries with an arsenal of tunes ranging from the ridiculous to the sublime: psychedelic calls to prayer, Henry Purcell’s Baroque art songs, Kraftwerk, Buffy St. Marie, Lee Hazlewood and Pink Floyd, as well as original songs by Magnuson and Dugas. </p>
<p>Dugas and Magnuson meet upon the stage to resolve a grudge; a duel ensues to settle their dispute that is fought using only music. Each singer brings a second to accompany them on the harp, the only other weapon allowed in the duel. Dugas and Theodoratus represent the East Coast, Magnuson and Rannie the West, as a battle rages - with much trickery and tomfoolery. Robin Walsh adds a dash of the surreal with her puppetry, and a special Halloween encore rounds out the night. There will be blood! </p>
<p>Why do we need your help? We are producing this all ourselves and need to fly and house three fantastic artists from Los Angeles in pricy New York City. We are trying to keep the door price low ($20) so that as many people as possible can attend and therefore we could use a bump in our financing to help cover production costs like props and puppet construction, and to pay all the artists involved a respectable fee: lighting designer, sound man, costumers, etc<br/></p>

They joined forces in 2009 at Flying Actor Studio in SF, while participating as students of its nine month physical theatre conservatory under Master Teachers James Donlon and Leonard Pitt. Edna and Karen found inspiration in each other, and their equally strange and absurd sense of humor, as well as their mutual obsession with Alice in Wonderland.

In reality, the play is an account of the psychological unravelling of the actresses, strangely braided with the story of <i>Alice. </i>The humor lies in the stream-of-consciousness detours that the actresses take as their character flaws relentlessly impede their own progress. Thirty seconds in, the play's title is readily earned.</p>

She also trained with Dijana Milosevic from Dah Teater in Belgrade, Serbia and assistant directed her show, 'Necromancers,' a story about the ethnic cleansing war of the early 90’s in then-Yugoslavia. Her USF thesis consisted of co-writing, performing in and creating sound design for a show called 'The Understory,' highlighting underprivileged SF communities, Bayview Hunter's Point and Tenderloin, with consultation from filmmaker, Kevin Epps. In early 2009, she completed her first community year-long residency at Climate Theater. <br/>Edna works on comedy sketches with performers in the Bay Area and abroad. On the side, she works as a motion capture performer at Mixamo Inc and was most recently featured in the Telltale Games' Jurassic Park. She dabbles in sound design and video editing as well. Her first short film, 'Passersby' was shown in two film festivals in 2009. She is also Dj Nobody at San Francisco's KUSF, the recently exiled online radio station of USF.</p>

She majored in Theatre Arts at San Francisco State University, where she focused on Suzuki Method, Meisner Technique, and Ensemble Theatre. In Oxford, Karen studied Shakespearean theatre and contemporary theatre at the British American Drama Academy. She also studied briefly in Paris with Theatre du Soleil. <br/>Karen's experience in professional and student performances in SF range from an all-female Shakespeare company, to Butoh and Bedouin dance, to the SF Opera. Her work in video and film art has led her to collaborate with the likes of George Kuchar and Michael Rudnick. Karen also has ten years' experience in various styles of Middle Eastern dance. She has studied and performed as a core member of Life Dance Theatre of San Francisco. <br/>Recently, Karen apprenticed with celebrated playwright, director, and actor, John O'Keefe. This experience jetstarted her into producing her own work. She presented her first solo show, a movement-based storytelling sequence called ""Portals"", in October 2010. She is currently in the process of writing a new script, ""Red House"".</p>

<h2><b><u>WHAT IF...</u></b></h2>
<p></p>
</div><div>
<p>We already tried a campaign on kickstarter and it failed because we asked for too much and couldn't circulate it to enough people. On kickstarter, you don't get any of your funding unless you reach your goal. If we don't make  any money, we can't pay all the people who help us get the show up. It's very difficult to find venues that don't ask for rental fees upfront, but luckily, we've found a new gallery space in SF called the Emerald Tablet, which will split the door with us each night. We're very happy about this because now we can spend the money we get to pay people and get all the right things for our set! And that is why we've moved our fundraiser here to indiegogo, where we can keep the funds raised regardless of reaching our goal or not. YAY indiegogo!</p>

</div></div>","Our Story  


Edna Miroslava Barrón and Karen Anne Light are artists living in San Francisco. They joined forces in 2009 at Flying Actor Studio in SF, while participating as students of its nine month physical theatre conservatory under Master Teachers James Donlon and Leonard Pitt. Edna and Karen found inspiration in each other, and their equally strange and absurd sense of humor, as well as their mutual obsession with Alice in Wonderland. Thus, a roller-coaster of theatrical adventure and strangeness ensued....


Alice: Down the Rwong Wrabbit Whole is an original comedic play, in development since autumn 2009. The script has been created from an extensive period of improvisations by Edna Barrón and Karen Anne Light, with guidance and mentorship from John Gilkey.
Aside from Alice in Wonderland the San Francisco artists have been influenced by the physical theatre techniques they studied together--mime, mask, clown, ensemble theatre--at Flying Actor Studio of San Francisco (website below). John Gilkey, a principal comedic performer in Cirque du Soleil and SF comedy troupe ""We Are Nudes"" (see websites below), was a guest teacher at FAS. He graciously agreed to continue working with Edna and Karen after their year at the Conservatory ended.
A short, incomplete preview of Alice (featuring guest performer, Laura Ferrari) was presented in January of 2011 to select audiences at Studio Gracia in SF, and now it's time to produce the show in its entirety.
In this play, the audience witnesses Karen and Edna attempt to adapt the animated movie, Alice in Wonderland, into a ""full-length theatrical production in which two women play each of the 359 characters."" In reality, the play is an account of the psychological unravelling of the actresses, strangely braided with the story of Alice. The humor lies in the stream-of-consciousness detours that the actresses take as their character flaws relentlessly impede their own progress. Thirty seconds in, the play's title is readily earned.
WHO WE ARE


EDNA (ED' GNAW-)
(websites below: sparklycuntjob.com , hookup-productions.com)
Edna studied Performing Arts & Social Justice at the University of San Francisco where she adapted, produced and directed the full-length novella, 'The Face', by David St. John, a professor/poet from USC. She also trained with Dijana Milosevic from Dah Teater in Belgrade, Serbia and assistant directed her show, 'Necromancers,' a story about the ethnic cleansing war of the early 90’s in then-Yugoslavia. Her USF thesis consisted of co-writing, performing in and creating sound design for a show called 'The Understory,' highlighting underprivileged SF communities, Bayview Hunter's Point and Tenderloin, with consultation from filmmaker, Kevin Epps. In early 2009, she completed her first community year-long residency at Climate Theater. Edna works on comedy sketches with performers in the Bay Area and abroad. On the side, she works as a motion capture performer at Mixamo Inc and was most recently featured in the Telltale Games' Jurassic Park. She dabbles in sound design and video editing as well. Her first short film, 'Passersby' was shown in two film festivals in 2009. She is also Dj Nobody at San Francisco's KUSF, the recently exiled online radio station of USF.
KAREN (NEER-ACK) (aka ""Kare Bear"")(website below- karenannelight.weebly.com...under construction)
Karen Anne Light began acting in ensemble theatre productions as a young girl in Chico, California, and realized early in life that she had found her calling. She majored in Theatre Arts at San Francisco State University, where she focused on Suzuki Method, Meisner Technique, and Ensemble Theatre. In Oxford, Karen studied Shakespearean theatre and contemporary theatre at the British American Drama Academy. She also studied briefly in Paris with Theatre du Soleil. Karen's experience in professional and student performances in SF range from an all-female Shakespeare company, to Butoh and Bedouin dance, to the SF Opera. Her work in video and film art has led her to collaborate with the likes of George Kuchar and Michael Rudnick. Karen also has ten years' experience in various styles of Middle Eastern dance. She has studied and performed as a core member of Life Dance Theatre of San Francisco. Recently, Karen apprenticed with celebrated playwright, director, and actor, John O'Keefe. This experience jetstarted her into producing her own work. She presented her first solo show, a movement-based storytelling sequence called ""Portals"", in October 2010. She is currently in the process of writing a new script, ""Red House"".



REVIEWS
Here is some feedback from audience members at the preview performance:
""Karen and Edna have paired up as a diva and doofus. A kind of art scene Abbott and Costello. And it works! It is about a story that never was, namely Alice in Wonderland. Oh yes, they have a very wet Mad Hatter's tea party which is hilarious (thank God it was in a plastic pool), and then the rabbit hole (a hula hoop that seems to keep moving) the mushroom, the shrinking and growing Alice..But halfway through, a series of wonderful and funny catastrophes set in and the piece gets even funnier.""               -John O'Keefe, award-winning playwright, actor, and director
""I sometimes dwell in sober acceptance that real life is not as good as it is in cartoons. But to my surprise, the wascally wrong wabbit hole adventure of two lively looney toons, Karen and Edna, batting their big round eyelashes and spinning around and about in a psychedelic, super-spirited frenzy, is an impressively metamorphic bit of theatre to behold! ""     -Chris White, performer
""Clowning with stand up and sketch comedy...Edna and Karen are right on the cutting edge. Edna's simple playfulness is the perfect foil for Karen's stern faux intellectualism spinning Alice down all sorts of wrong rabbit holes.""  Michael Sommers, playwright and director
''The performers, Karen Anne Light and Edna Miroslava Barron--brilliant, subtle gorgeous movers. They have a wonderful control of their bodies. Funny? Fucking hilarious...in this incisive way that captures the nuance of all the messy stuff of being human...Their relationship to each other intertwines with the story of Alice in Wonderland as they play all the characters and the tree, and switch who gets to play alice, and pour water over their hands from teacups, and sing through the holes of tutus..."" -Karen Penley, playwright and performer

WHAT IF...


We already tried a campaign on kickstarter and it failed because we asked for too much and couldn't circulate it to enough people. On kickstarter, you don't get any of your funding unless you reach your goal. If we don't make  any money, we can't pay all the people who help us get the show up. It's very difficult to find venues that don't ask for rental fees upfront, but luckily, we've found a new gallery space in SF called the Emerald Tablet, which will split the door with us each night. We're very happy about this because now we can spend the money we get to pay people and get all the right things for our set! And that is why we've moved our fundraiser here to indiegogo, where we can keep the funds raised regardless of reaching our goal or not. YAY indiegogo!


What We Need 

THE SET- Edna and Karen have already assembled and procured a majority of the set and costumes from local thrift stores, under a less-than-a-shoestring budget. Kind friends and fellow artists have lent their aid in construction of a giant toadstool mushroom, and a hula hoop-and-paper rendition of a giant vagina (!).
THE SOUND- The mindbending, melting cartoon-style soundscore has been wittilly crafted by Ms. Barron.
THE LIGHTS- Lighting cues are simple and can be easily modified for any performance venue.
THE TOUR- The artists are in communication with fellow artists in SF, LA, NYC, and Portland to secure performance venues for their tour.
GUEST PERFORMERS- Part of the show involves collaboration with a guest performer. The preview featured Laura Ferrari (LA-based clown, comedian, actress; website below). Future presentations may include Miss Ferrari, as well as Eduardo Vildasol (international costume designer, comedic actor, physical performer, visual artist; last website below), and Jane Osborn (LA-based aerial performer, clown, actress, musician; website below).
            *                 *                  *                 *                  *                *                  
WHERE YOUR MONEY WILL GO
-Payment for artists, guest performers, designing artists
-Material costs for new set pieces, lights
-Venue fees in NY and LA


**WE ARE ASKING FOR MUCH LESS THAN WE ACTUALLY NEED FOR THE FULL TOUR. 
WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR WHATEVER YOU PLEDGE....FEEL FREE TO PASS THIS ON TO FRIENDS (and enemies), AS WE WOULD LOVE TO RECEIVE BEYOND OUR REQUESTED AMOUNT!!**
    THANK YOU ! THANK YOU! THANK YOU! THANK YOU! THANK YOU!!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello all! My name is Suse Doepken, a recent graduate from Western Oregon University. In 2020 I completed my senior thesis project, which is a full-length play that delves into David Bowie's music, relationships, addictions, and significant events that shaped his life and work. I have always loved his work, and I spent the last two years researching and finalizing this script with the plan of a performance before my college graduation. Unfortunately, it had to put it on pause due to COVID-19.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the wonderful Majestic Theater in Corvallis, OR has been able to reserve space for me in their theater so that I can not only perform the play I spent years writing, but also film it for those who cannot travel to see it due to restrictions. However, it's very expensive for a recent college grad, so I'm reaching out in hopes others can help donate to decrease the upfront cost I'm facing for not just the venue, but also the minimal costumes, props, and lighting the play requires.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am aiming to raise $1500, which not only covers most of the cost of reserving the space, but also allows me a small budget for costumes, props, makeup, etc. Rental space for 4 or 5 days will be around $1000, and costumes, etc will be around $500.  Any extra money will only help make this stage production the best it can be, such as extending our reservation to allow more practice and performance days. I'm very grateful to all of your support in this endeavor &lt;3</p>
<p><strong>PERKS!</strong></p>
<p>-For donations of $1, you will receive a link to watch the play once it has been filmed and edited!</p>
<p>-For donations $5, you will receive a link to watch the play once it has been filmed and edited!</p>
<p>-For donations $10, you will receive a link to watch the play, as well as a playbill that will be mailed to you!</p>
<p>-For donations $20, you will receive a link to watch the play, a playbill, a thank you card from cast and crew, and our eternal love &lt;3</p>
<p>If the goal of $1500 is not met, all proceeds will still go to funding this production, the rental space, costumes, props, etc. Any donation helps, and we're grateful for your support!!!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The reason I wrote this play at all was because I wanted to share my love and interest of David Bowie with others. He and his music have had a profound impact on me. I think examining his life in order to understand his music is fascinating, and I want others to see his work through the same lens I do.</p>
<p>This play has been like a literal child to me, and not being able to perform it last year was truly devastating. Although it's obvious why it couldn't happen, I'm extremely glad that an opportunity came along for me to continue this project. I'm determined to do everything I can to make this production possible, hence this indiegogo project!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I totally understand if you are not able to contribute, and I'm so thankful you even clicked this indiegogo to check it out! If you can't contribute, I hope you consider sharing or telling your friends about it to continue getting the word out &lt;3</p>

He and his music have had a profound impact on me. I think examining his life in order to understand his music is fascinating, and I want others to see his work through the same lens I do.
This play has been like a literal child to me, and not being able to perform it last year was truly devastating. Although it's obvious why it couldn't happen, I'm extremely glad that an opportunity came along for me to continue this project. I'm determined to do everything I can to make this production possible, hence this indiegogo project!

<h2>Let's Keep Live Theatre Alive!</h2>
<p>Hello, dear friends!</p>
<p>My name is Dan Kostelec, and I’m the guy who plays your friendly, neighbourhood <a href=""http://facebook.com/ShakespeareApproves"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Shakespeare</a> at Renaissance Faires, schools and more all over the country in my one-man, audience-interactive, improvisational Shakespeare show, “<a href=""http://facebook.com/shakespeareapproves"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Shakespeare Approves!</a>” I take some of the Bard’s plays and turn them into half-hour, live-action, interactive cartoons where the audience members are the actors, props, and scenery.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 crisis has shut down everything, renaissance faires and theaters included - and some of the most vulnerable people in our increasingly-gig-based economy are your favorite performers in theatre and renaissance festivals.</p>
<p>Piggy-backing on the success of the first two shows (""<a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/12th-night-the-3-bears-live-and-online#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">12th Night &amp; the 3 Bears</a>!"", ""<a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/r-j-the-flying-implement-of-doom-edition-live#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Romeo &amp; Juliet: The Flying Implement of Doom Edition!</a>"") performed by our new online theatre company, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/SocialDistancingPlayers"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Social Distancing Players </a>, we're back for round #3 of online, irreverent, quasi-improvisational, audience-interactive family fun with ""Julius Caesar: Beware the Ides of March of the Penguins!""</p>
<p>Actors from theatre companies and some of your favorite Ren Faire acts will be performing a live reading adapted from my stage show that is normally produced at festivals as an audience-interactive, improvisational show.</p>
<p>I'm looking to raise at least $900.00 for this first performance, so that I can guarantee each actor a minimum of $100 (and hopefully more!( for their time in bringing us joy and laughter. And that's where you come in. We need your help to make it happen!</p>
<h3><strong> What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>We need $900.00. Okay - that part was pretty straight-forward</p>
<h3>What do you get?</h3>
<p>A part in the show! And also much more!</p>
<p>If you're familiar with my live, in-person ren faire show, you know that I use the audience members as my cast, the set, even as some of the props. So keeping with that tradition, if you are able to donate to this cause, the first 4 people to donate $50 or more will get to be in the show (all roles are first-come, first served). Yeah, it sounds like pay-to-play, because it is. But if you can afford it, I guarantee that you'll have a marvelous time!</p>
<p><strong>Roles Available</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Calphernia</li>
<li>Casca</li>
<li>Cinna</li>
<li>Julius Caesar</li>
</ul>
<p>But wait — there’s more!</p>
<p>Let’s say you have some cash but can’t afford to go up to $50. Well, for $30 you can get a copy of the performance script signed by the author (that’s me!).</p>
<p>And if you’re feeling particularly generous and want to donate $100 - well, you get some goodies! You get the signed performance script, a part in the show (if you desire, and if they haven’t been snatched up yet — all roles are first-come, first served), AND a personalized sonnet commissioned JUST FOR YOU (a $20 value).</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>You will directly be helping professional entertainers keep ""professional"" as part of their job title, by helping us to pay our bills, buy our groceries (when we dare to venture outside during this social distancing period), and not sink deeper into poverty or credit card debt.</p>
<p>You're helping to extend hope and build morale for our fellow members of humanity by giving them a much-needed distraction during this crisis, a sense that a return-to-normal is not just possible but inevitable.</p>

non-conforming people, and our two-woman show is no different. Great Scott Media called it “a whimsical, funny, incisive romp through the absurdities
of socially imposed femininity.”Even if you can’t contribute, please consider sharing
our campaign with your friends, and don’t forget to come out to the show—we can’t

<h3>Medicine the Musical</h3>
<p>This production has a budget of $65,000 and is part of the SubletSeries@HERE: a curated rental program, which provides artists with subsidized space and equipment, as well as technical support. The show will will run for 14 shows Nov. 3-18, 2018. Tickets are on sale at: <a href=""https://web.ovationtix.com/trs/pr/993113"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://web.ovationtix.com/trs/pr/993113</a></p>
<p>Set to a dynamic rock score, Medicine the Musical follows a group of first year medical students as they struggle with their lives, loves, and the rigors of their education. It is a unique platform with which to share with the public something about the world of medicine, including the pressures and frustrations felt by doctors and medical students.</p>
<p>What started as the seed of an idea while I was in medical school has now matured into a full-fledged musical production. Following on a successful staged concert reading in April 2017 (see the video), we are now determined to bring this show to a New York off-Broadway production.  </p>
<p>This is your chance to support the arts in a meaningful way and bring this exciting project to the stage. See the show, meet the cast, attend the opening night party, and receive lots of cool theater swag.</p>
<p>The full video from the staged reading is above, and here are links to individual songs.</p>
<p>Remember, keep it concise, yet personal. Ask yourself: if someone stopped reading here would they be ready to make a contribution?</p>

Lately, it has been poverty, violence, and bad water, but there is so much more to The Vehicle City. The people of Flint have a long history of fighting, surviving and winning. Flint is overcoming its current challenges just as Flint folk of an earlier generation overcame the world’s largest corporation to acquire safe working conditions, a better standard of living for their families and financial security to generations of American workers. We are a company of students and faculty from Alma College in Alma, Michigan and we are creating our devised theatre piece to share one of the great stories of our state with the international arts community at the world’s largest arts festival in the Summer of 2019.  The Edinburgh Fringe provides us a great opportunity, but not for free.What We Need & What You GetWhile we have raised some funds through local events and donations, and committed a fair amount of our own money, we are a long way from our goal. We need your help to get over the finish line.  Your support will be used for registration fees, space rental accommodations, as well as production and travel costs.  For ExampleAirfare to Edinburgh $6400Lodging and Venue Rental – $18,000Meals – $8000Incidentals – $2000Production Cost - $4000We want you to know that we appreciate your help, so we have developed a set of perks that we want to share with you if you donate at various levels.  You could receive a social media shout out, a digital thank you note, a show poster signed by the company, or a 44 Days T-Shirt.Other Ways You Can HelpThe 44 Days Company understands that not all of our supporters can make a financial contribution, but we would appreciate any help you can give.  Maybe you could

CastWILLIAM ""JOE"" HARRISONI am from Belding Michigan, I am a senior at Alma College pursuing a degree in New Media Studies and a second major in Theatre. I have been part of Alma College Theatre since my freshman year both as an actor (Our Town, The Laramie Project, The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee, Northanger Abbey)  as a technician (Rumors, Dracula, Soldier’s Heart). Outside of Alma College, I have worked with Unto These Hills Outdoor Drama (Cherokee, NC), and Blessed Unrest (New York, NY). Outside of theatre, I have worked as a production assistant on the short film Base Camp, and as an assistant editor for The Show About The Show, and Mutable Films.  CASSIDY SANFORDI’m from Caledonia Michigan and I am a senior at Alma College. Though I am primarily a technician, I am intrigued by the idea of stepping out of my comfort zone into the world of acting for this production. Some of my past productions include being Master Electrician and/or Sound Engineer on Eurydice, Much Ado About Nothing, Northanger Abbey, Soldier's Heart, and Dracula. I am grateful for the opportunity to share the story of the Flint Sit Down Strike and to gain more experience and knowledge about devised theatre and is happy to be able to share the fruits of mine and my fellow performers hard work.   DANIEL CHALICEI am a junior at Alma with double majors in theatre and marketing. I grew up in the small town of Saugatuck, Michigan and discovered he had a gift for the stage in my sophomore year of high school.  At Alma, I have been involved in several shows with my favorite role being Benedick in Much Ado About Nothing. I stay physically active during the day with exercise and slow down in the evenings playing video games with his friends. Upon graduation, I plan to Chicago, New York, or Los Angeles to pursue a career in the arts.  ELIZABETH PECHOTAI am a Psychology and Theatre major at Alma College.

<p><strong>The Project</strong></p>
<p>Hi There!</p>
<p>We are producers, directors, actors, designers, technicians and artists from the Ryerson School of Performance. We are students, on the cusp of graduation, using or final months before “real life” to collaborate on a fully realized theatrical production. We are joining forces to bring to life one of the most beautiful plays of our time.</p>
<p><i>Eurydice</i>, written by Sarah Ruhl, is a modern theatrical adaptation of the ancient Greek tragedy of Orpheus and Eurydice. Unlike the Greek version, which follows Orpheus’ story, this play highlights the character of Eurydice and explores her journey through life and the Underworld. <i>Eurydice</i> analyzes all the forms love and loss can take in a witty, absurd and poignant manner.</p>
<p>Where: The Ryerson Theatre, Toronto ON.</p>
<p>When: April 10<sup>th</sup>, 2017, 8pm</p>
<p><strong>Where Will the Money Go?</strong></p>
<p>Our campaign goal is $1000. This amount will go specifically to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Props for the Show</li>
<li>Paint for the Set</li>
<li>Equipment Rentals &amp; Repairs</li>
</ul>
<p>If we are unable to reach our goal, we will divide the donations we receive between the props and paints departments. If, better yet, we go above our goal, all additional funds will be put into construction materials for the set and costumes.</p>
<p><strong>Perks</strong></p>
<p>As a small incentive to donate, we have some fun perks to offer!  Some of these include, a high-five from the director, a poster signed by the cast, a personalized thank-you letter from a character from the show and more!</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>There is a stigma surrounding student theatre that it is not at the same caliber as professional work. We believe, given the resources, we can create something beautiful that will uphold the same standard as a professional theatre company. Please help us set the record straight.</p>
<p>With your help, we will be putting this story on its feet. By contributing, you are allowing the designers and director to realize their vision to its fullest potential. You will be helping us create a platform with which to launch ourselves into the industry. You will be helping us conclude our education with a piece of work we can be proud of.</p>
<p>A huge challenge of independently producing theatre as students is finding ways to raise finances for our work. We not only want to get our project up and running, but we want to help future students as well. That is why, any additional profit we make from ticket sales will go into a pot that will be given to the next group of students from our school, who wish to independently produce a show.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>We understand that not everyone is able to donate. However, you can still contribute by:</p>

<p>Greetings friends, supporters, comrades, co-conspirators, strangers and curious alike. Here's a friendly plea from within the art-making trenches dug from a desolate fund raising landscape. </p>
<p>Please help David Neumann/Advanced Beginner Group make it to their New York premiere! </p>
<p>Please support our process and help our extraordinary collaborative team realize this important work. </p>
<h3>What's the project and who's involved?</h3>
<p></p> <p></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>I Understand Everything Better</i> is a multi-disciplinary performance piece conceived and directed by David Neumann with a stellar team of collaborators fast approaching two premieres!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Collaborators include:<br/>Tei Blow: Sound design, Music Direction<br/>Sibyl Kempson: Text<br/>Chloe Brown: Lights<br/>Mimi Lien: Set<br/>Christine Shallenberg: Projections<br/>Erica Sweany: Costumes</p>
<p>and performers Tei Blow, John Gasper, Karen Kandel, Jennifer Kidwell, David Neumann</p>
<p>with additional important help from: Eben Hoffer, Merrick Williams, Meredith Boggia, and Amanda Brandes</p>
<p></p>
<p><i>I Understand Everything Better</i> came out of a life-changing experience most people eventually must go through. David's parents died on either side of Hurricane Sandy. His mother, suddenly in the summer. His father had a longer journey and died a few weeks after the storm made landfall. Neumann started this work nearly a year later. <i>I Understand Everything Better</i> is both fiction and truth, riding the fine line between the purely presentational and the deeply personal (to quote our collaborator, Sibyl Kempson).</p>
<p>The work is an attempt to articulate the many layers of that experience and maybe even the consciousness of dying itself (and with that, those taking care of the dying).  Using structural elements of the Japanese Noh Theater as a container for these ideas, <i>I Understand Everything Better</i> shares some formal elements with the Nohgaku and above all a belief that there's great value in engaging the imagination when exploring the more mysterious  parts of our experience.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Mr. Neumann proves once again to be an astute, sensitive observer of the human condition in all its funny and desperate and, finally, beautiful frailty.” – <i>The New York Times</i></p>

<p></p>
<p>Led by Artistic Director, Dianne Vapnek, <b>DANCEworks</b> is an annual choreographic residency that partners with The Lobero Theatre in Santa Barbara, California. This residency provides artists with 40 hours a week in the theatre to explore their creative ideas and to make new work. The only requirement is that the work/exploration be shared with Santa Barbara audiences at the conclusion of their residency.<br/></p>
<p>In September, Adam Barruch Dance will be the DANCEworks company-in-residence at the Lobero Theatre. During this time, Adam Barruch and six performers from New York will explore a new dance theater production of Stephen Sondheim's masterpiece, <i>Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street</i>. During the process, which will be mentored by acclaimed choreographer and dancer, Margie Gillis, the company will work with the score to create a new interpretation of this classic work, emphasizing the role in which the body is used to portray both character and narrative. The intent of this research is to incorporate elements of contemporary dance, mime, puppetry and visual design into the musical to enhance the audience's experience of Sondheim's rich and complex score. The goal of the four week process is to begin adapting the material and create a new paradigm that can be used to stage a full scaled production in the future.     <a href=""http://www.sbdanceworks.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"" target=""_blank"">Learn more about DANCEworks</a></p>

<p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Artists' Fees</b>: We have six multi-faceted performers coming to Santa Barbara from New York. </li>
<li>
<b>Costume Design</b>: For this project we will be collaborating with designer Marine Penvern to create original costume pieces for the performers. Your support will help with costs for design concepts, fabric and materials, and costume construction.</li>
<li>
<b>Travel Costs</b>: Your support will help provide each artist with airfare from New York to Santa Barbara.</li>
<li>
<b>Preparatory Musical Rehearsals</b>: It is essential that the artists-in-residence have time to prepare vocally and familiarize themselves with Sondheim’s complex score before September. Your support will help fund space rentals, and fees for our musical director in New York. </li>

<blockquote>
<i style=""font-weight: normal;"">“As one’s creative life pushes forward, there are always seeds of ideas that remain in the back of the mind. In some ways, they appear as complete works, just waiting to be actualized. As time passes they often sit there steeping, and because of certain limitations–lack of time, energy, or space–they cannot become a reality. I think the greatest gift, and perhaps greatest challenge, is when circumstances align and that passion project can finally come onto the drafting table. </i><i style=""font-weight: normal;"">Dianne Vapnek and Santa Barbara DANCEworks has given me the chance to catalyze this process, and delve deeper into my craft then I have ever been before. I am extremely honored and incredibly excited for the 2015 DANCEworks Residency, and hope that you can join us and support the beginning of an amazing journey.""   </i>

DANCEworks Santa Barbara: 'Sweeney' begins...



Led by Artistic Director, Dianne Vapnek, DANCEworks is an annual choreographic residency that partners with The Lobero Theatre in Santa Barbara, California. This residency provides artists with 40 hours a week in the theatre to explore their creative ideas and to make new work. The only requirement is that the work/exploration be shared with Santa Barbara audiences at the conclusion of their residency.
In September, Adam Barruch Dance will be the DANCEworks company-in-residence at the Lobero Theatre. During this time, Adam Barruch and six performers from New York will explore a new dance theater production of Stephen Sondheim's masterpiece, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. During the process, which will be mentored by acclaimed choreographer and dancer, Margie Gillis, the company will work with the score to create a new interpretation of this classic work, emphasizing the role in which the body is used to portray both character and narrative. The intent of this research is to incorporate elements of contemporary dance, mime, puppetry and visual design into the musical to enhance the audience's experience of Sondheim's rich and complex score. The goal of the four week process is to begin adapting the material and create a new paradigm that can be used to stage a full scaled production in the future.     Learn more about DANCEworks

We Need Your Support! 


In order to facilitate this journey in September, we are in need of your support. We are looking to raise $8,000 which will help with expenses including: 








Artists' Fees: We have six multi-faceted performers coming to Santa Barbara from New York. 

Costume Design: For this project we will be collaborating with designer Marine Penvern to create original costume pieces for the performers. Your support will help with costs for design concepts, fabric and materials, and costume construction.

Travel Costs: Your support will help provide each artist with airfare from New York to Santa Barbara.

Preparatory Musical Rehearsals: It is essential that the artists-in-residence have time to prepare vocally and familiarize themselves with Sondheim’s complex score before September. Your support will help fund space rentals, and fees for our musical director in New York.

Chelsea Bonosky 
Tim Heck

From Adam Barruch...






“As one’s creative life pushes forward, there are always seeds of ideas that remain in the back of the mind. In some ways, they appear as complete works, just waiting to be actualized. As time passes they often sit there steeping, and because of certain limitations–lack of time, energy, or space–they cannot become a reality. I think the greatest gift, and perhaps greatest challenge, is when circumstances align and that passion project can finally come onto the drafting table. Dianne Vapnek and Santa Barbara DANCEworks has given me the chance to catalyze this process, and delve deeper into my craft then I have ever been before. I am extremely honored and incredibly excited for the 2015 DANCEworks Residency, and hope that you can join us and support the beginning of an amazing journey.""",0.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<p><a href=""https://www.updateirl.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">UPDATE</a> is an immersive performance-ritual using music, dance, theater, creative technology, and installation art to create an interactive landscape that transforms audience members into performers and strangers into a community. A response to the noise, desensitization, and disembodiment of the internet, <a href=""https://www.updateirl.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">UPDATE</a> empowers individuals using interaction and improvisation to generate agency and responsibility in an unfamiliar world. Together, we'll struggle to understand what it takes to connect in this increasingly mediated age of human experience.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">WHY OUR WORK MATTERS</h3>
<p>What does it mean to experience life through virtual interaction? Swept up in a hurricane of accelerating information that leaves us oversaturated yet insatiated, paralyzed and isolated yet active and connected, we asked ourselves: How can we get our bearings in an ever-changing landscape? How do we clear the fog to see ourselves and each other? How can we regain a sense of personal value beyond narcissism? And what do these things mean for where we are, where we’re going, and what we’ll become?</p>
<p><a href=""http://updateirl.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">UPDATE</a> is our response. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1556596193/old4xhqd7y6g7de6adzy.jpg"" src="""" style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""/></p>
<p>Facilitating agency and collective responsibility through immersion, improvisation, and interaction, <a href=""https://www.updateirl.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">UPDATE</a> offers a new kind of audience experience: a performance shaped by its audience and their choices; a space that integrates every individual within it; a ritual that transforms its audience into liberated performers. In doing so, we are pushing against a rigid tradition of spectatorship, passivity, and control, opting instead for integration, activity, and freedom.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1556596129/de9mxve8aoip4umqbtqg.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We began developing <a href=""https://www.updateirl.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">UPDATE</a> in November of 2018. We had no resources, no assumptions, no predetermined course of action. What we had was a small group of ambitious artists and an impulse that we couldn't describe but all understood: the feeling of being subsumed by the internet. Every idea our ensemble pursues is measured by its truthfulness to that impulse, because we didn't just want to make another piece of theater about the internet—we wanted to create something that was our living experience of it at every level of performance. </p>
<p>To date, our group of 5 collaborators has expanded to 16 artists across a range of disciplines: actors, dancers, composers, live musicians, and creative technologist. This number grows with every performance as audience members, moved by their experience, are compelled to join <a href=""https://www.updateirl.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">UPDATE</a> without assured compensation or financial support, all because they believe in the importance of our vision.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">OUR PROCESS + VALUES</h3>
<p><strong>A community of synchronized individuals.</strong> We believe community begins with individuals in relation. To be, and to listen, means having the courage to lead and the humility to follow. The decision of one is simultaneously the decision of many: to listen or ignore. Within <a href=""https://www.updateirl.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">UPDATE</a>, anything anyone does or doesn't do, whether observing quietly or screaming obscenities, becomes part of the performance and changes its outcome. This is what we share with our audience: a space where the effect of every choice is seen and felt, where the power of an individual is found in those around them.</p>
<p><strong>We work with what we have.</strong> We rehearse in apartment spaces and practice with strangers in the street. There is no waste in our process. This means that as we gain resources, every new element is valued and incorporated into the heart of the piece.  </p>
<p><strong>Collaborative experimentation and exploration. </strong>This means we devise exercises, we try and fail, we adapt and try again. Our rehearsals and performances are laboratories  committed to the experience of each and every individual; to offering, listening,  responding, and never settling. </p>

</div></div>","UPDATE YOUR LIFE
UPDATE is an immersive performance-ritual using music, dance, theater, creative technology, and installation art to create an interactive landscape that transforms audience members into performers and strangers into a community. A response to the noise, desensitization, and disembodiment of the internet, UPDATE empowers individuals using interaction and improvisation to generate agency and responsibility in an unfamiliar world. Together, we'll struggle to understand what it takes to connect in this increasingly mediated age of human experience.

WHY OUR WORK MATTERS
What does it mean to experience life through virtual interaction? Swept up in a hurricane of accelerating information that leaves us oversaturated yet insatiated, paralyzed and isolated yet active and connected, we asked ourselves: How can we get our bearings in an ever-changing landscape? How do we clear the fog to see ourselves and each other? How can we regain a sense of personal value beyond narcissism? And what do these things mean for where we are, where we’re going, and what we’ll become?
UPDATE is our response. 

Facilitating agency and collective responsibility through immersion, improvisation, and interaction, UPDATE offers a new kind of audience experience: a performance shaped by its audience and their choices; a space that integrates every individual within it; a ritual that transforms its audience into liberated performers. In doing so, we are pushing against a rigid tradition of spectatorship, passivity, and control, opting instead for integration, activity, and freedom.  

We began developing UPDATE in November of 2018. We had no resources, no assumptions, no predetermined course of action. What we had was a small group of ambitious artists and an impulse that we couldn't describe but all understood: the feeling of being subsumed by the internet. Every idea our ensemble pursues is measured by its truthfulness to that impulse, because we didn't just want to make another piece of theater about the internet—we wanted to create something that was our living experience of it at every level of performance. 
To date, our group of 5 collaborators has expanded to 16 artists across a range of disciplines: actors, dancers, composers, live musicians, and creative technologist. This number grows with every performance as audience members, moved by their experience, are compelled to join UPDATE without assured compensation or financial support, all because they believe in the importance of our vision.
Our cast + collaborators: 
Michael DelaFlor / Benjamin Satchel / Adrian Collins / Shannon Barnes / Fernando Casablancas / Jade Manns / Hope Luna / Richard Pannullo / Marlaina Riegelsberger / Mateo Hernandez Almeyda / Diego Blanc Zoco / Aaron Jean / Jon Clancy / Cesar Pinzon / Tyler Neidermeyer / Nola Latty / Irmak Hatirli  
""There's so much stimuli. I was totally on edge throughout the show and I loved it."" @kingdiegs
""I stopped thinking and just started doing. And it felt right."" @milesk3
""Unlike anything else. Be ready to be surprised."" @imariasofia
""They challenged us to choose our role within the work. It's incredible to see artists and audience members collaborating on the same mission, especially when neither can predict exactly what will happen or where it will lead to."" @jordanryder_

OUR PROCESS + VALUES
A community of synchronized individuals. We believe community begins with individuals in relation. To be, and to listen, means having the courage to lead and the humility to follow. The decision of one is simultaneously the decision of many: to listen or ignore. Within UPDATE, anything anyone does or doesn't do, whether observing quietly or screaming obscenities, becomes part of the performance and changes its outcome. This is what we share with our audience: a space where the effect of every choice is seen and felt, where the power of an individual is found in those around them.
We work with what we have. We rehearse in apartment spaces and practice with strangers in the street. There is no waste in our process. This means that as we gain resources, every new element is valued and incorporated into the heart of the piece.  
Collaborative experimentation and exploration. This means we devise exercises, we try and fail, we adapt and try again. Our rehearsals and performances are laboratories  committed to the experience of each and every individual; to offering, listening,  responding, and never settling. 
Accessible and uncompromising. While drawing from diverse influences across the spectrum of art, we believe the audience experience should transcend any familiarity with those mediums. We want to bring an uncompromising vision to as many people as possible, and we work rigorously to ensure that no matter who you are or where you come from, you can be a part of UPDATE.  
Ethical interaction. Simply said, this means our audience is free. There is no wrong way to be an audience, because in the world we envision everything that everyone does is perfect. We do not tell you how to be; we only offer opportunities to discover what you could be. 

FEED US AND WE FEED YOU
UPDATE is independently run by a group of young artists. This is both to our advantage and disadvantage: we are free to explore what this performance could be without fidelity to institutions or traditional demarcations, but are tasked with innovating a sustainable model for a new style of performance.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><i>Lured</i></h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i>A new play based on real events</i></strong></p>
<p><i>Lured</i>, by Frank J. Avella, is a brutal, visceral new play that examines the nature of hate crimes against gays, using real events in Russia as a backdrop.  Sadly, in this current world climate, the play could not be timelier. We are hoping to shed light on these horrific atrocities and create a dialogue for change.</p>
<p>We are grateful to be bringing this important piece directed by Frank J. Avella and Carlotta Brentan to Theater for the New City (Crystal Field, Artistic Director) in November 2018, and then take the production to the inaugural edition of the OnStage! American Theater Festival in Rome, Italy in January 2019. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Why we are telling this story</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i><strong>Shedding light on darkness. Sparking conversations.</strong> </i></p>
<p>The scenes depicted in <i>Lured</i> are strongly grounded in real, documented events that have been taking place in Russia since 2013. As a result of 2013's ""Anti-Propaganda"" law (Federal Law No. 135-FZ), the country saw a spate of anti-LGBTQ violence, often carried out by organized hate groups who followed their discriminatory agenda with impunity. </p>
<p>These stories are not well known in the U.S. We believe this must change. Moreover, while rooted in a specific cultural and social milieu, the questions that <i>Lured</i> asks are universal: is hate innate, or taught? Is revenge ever a viable answer? Where will the cycle of rising hatred, tangible everywhere we turn in the world today, lead us? </p>
<p><i>Lured</i> is a story that elicits unparalleled passion in everyone who comes into contact with it. At ever stage of its development, we have been blown away by audience reactions to this challenging piece. <u><i>Lured</i> is not an easy sit, but we believe it is a vital one, and we hope you will agree.</u></p>

<p>An early version of <i>Lured</i> was first presented at the Dream Up! Festival at Theater for the New City in the Summer of 2016, playing six performances to sold-out audiences. The New York Times recommended the play for those ""looking for adventurous theater.” </p>
<p>In 2017, the piece was chosen to take part in the 36th Annual William Inge Theater Festival (PlayLabs). The latest incarnation of <i>Lured</i> was a semi-finalist for the 2018 O'Neill National Playwrights Conference, and received a 2018 grant from the Arch and Bruce Brown Foundation. </p>
<p><u>Which brings us to today:</u> <i>Lured</i> will have its World Premiere produced by Theater for the New City for a 3-week run, November 8 - 25, 2018. We will then be taking the entire production overseas to Rome, Italy, where <i>Lured</i> will be part of the inaugural edition of OnStage! American Theater Festival in January 2019. </p>

At our last event, your support let us build a terrifying Halloween Forest filled with monstrous creatures, lush and terrifying foliage, and wrestling! The brutal Schoolteacher, MRS. FENNENBAUM was defeated, and our favorite UNFROZEN COLONIAL WOMAN, THEODOSIA, earned her GED, through combat. NONE WERE LEFT UNMOVED!PWR now prepares for our 14th Party! Can you believe that??? Thanks to you—the MULTIVERSE—PWR has  become something far beyond what we ever could have imagined. In 3.5 years we've gone from a handful of people watching a home-made ring in a backyard to attendance of a thousand+ and a full spectrum of professional audio, video and lighting. And we've built almost all of it ourselves, thanks to you! We continue to do a DIY show that is all-ages and free to the public, even as costs increase. Your continued support allows our core ethos to flourish. It means so much to us. The show remains FREE TO ATTEND, even as we mount mammoth costs. Here's what we want to do for our next show.SPACE CHRISTMASEach PWR show has a special theme: we've explored HAUNTED FORESTS, surived the ROBOT APOCAYLPSE, and traded blows with REANIMATED DINOSAURS.The HOLIDAY SEASON is always a great opportunity for cool art and stories, and offers a special challenge to be unique. Our WINTER WONDERSLAM shows have had varied styles: We've done one with a Holiday Atmosphere, a Christmas/Halloween Mashup, and an ICE CAVES one. This next one will be arguably our coolest yet, and perhaps our most exciting theme of all time: OUTER SPACE!We're going to build 4th Tap Brewing Co-Op into a STAR-WORTHY craft to take us on a journey to the deepest stars. Prepare for an immersive environment with horrific and awe-inspiring cosmic monstrosities, star trek-style tech, glorious cosmic phenomena, and of course, plenty of aliens. And you'd better believe we're going to wrestle those aliens.At our last event, the PARTYWEIGHT BELT was taken into space by the dreaded QUEEN GALEXIA: Empress of Voids, Sovereign of Planets, Mayor of Neptune! Our TRVE CHAMPION, the Unfrozen Colonial Woman, Theodosia, must find her and reclaim our belt in an INTERGALACTIC CHALLENGE! This is the greatest single wrestling conflict in human history.Our roster of PARTY ATHLETES will compete in distinctly SPACE-ORIENTED challenges. The Intergalactic Express, Dan ""The Man"" Ziglar, Luigi Primo, Alexandra Cage, Charlie Frown, the Dumpster Babes, Big Daddy Bolero, Dino Rida, and more will be there hopping from planet to planet, waging merciless PARTY VIOLENCE!  HAIL BABY WORM!What is this money used for?$5000 is a lot of money!

<h3>About The Play</h3>
<p>Four friends band together to play the English translation of best-selling JRPG, The Four Holy Beats. However, due to slow buffering speeds, our heroes-in-training must wait to “press START.” However, that doesn't mean the game hasn't already started. Choose Your Character marinates in (esoteric) memes and video game culture, meditating on what it means to have an identity when IRL and virtual realities intersect.</p>
<h3>Creative Team</h3>
<p>Jordan Ho (playwright/performer)</p>
<p>This is Jordan's playwriting debut. Mx. Ho wrote ""Choose Your Character"" to give trans artists space to flesh out what identity means beyond the basics of ""preferred"" gender pronouns. Memes. Internet Jargon. Keyboard Smash Text Monologues. There is humor in the tears and sadness in the laughter. Xe creates theater because there is something to be said in that can only be done through the communal experience of sharing space and time.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp;(!) What's in it for you</h3>
<p>We are thrilled to opening our show as a part of The Trans Theatre Festival. This is a festival hosted by The Brick in Williamsburg that celebrates art created by transgender and gender-nonconforming artists. </p>
<p>We value the work of queer artists and want to ensure that all levels of the production are properly compensated for their time and effort; this is why for this production of Choose Your Character we are only employing queer artists in the cast and design team.</p>
<p>Costumes, rehearsal space, lighting, sound, performers all have one thing in common: they all cost money. In late-capitalism it's becoming more and more difficult to see indie queer theatre experiences on stage. With your help we will be able to fully fund and realize this chaotic good new work. Your support of queer theatre speaks volumes, and any contribution you can make is greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Christine Bonansea – a French-born, NYC-based choreographer known for her striking, virtuosic performances – brings OnlyHuman, a visually arresting, media-enhanced work to New York for its US premiere at Danspace Project. Developed in collaboration with an international group of stellar multidisciplinary artists, and following successful presentations at DOCK11 in Berlin and 2018 Tanzmesse in Düsseldorf, Germany,  and the BIDAM in Korea, the evening-length version of this production will be presented for the first time to the American audiences November 15-17.</p>
<p>Tickets ($22 General / $15 Danspace Members) are available online through OvationTix (<a href=""https://web.ovationtix.com/trs/pr/996935"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://web.ovationtix.com/trs/pr/996935</a>) or by calling 866-811-4111.</p>
<p>Inspired by Friedrich Nietzsche’s aphoristic volume Human, All Too Human, Bonansea investigates the stark contradiction between our race’s capacity for beauty against its most destructive tendencies, embodying the struggle with her intensely kinetic choreography. In OnlyHuman, Bonansea ruminates on corporeal images and stereotypes of self in the context of the landscape of emotions, geography and social structures. As most of Bonansea’s multidisciplinary works, OnlyHuman has been created during an intimately collaborative process. The dance – featuring a lead performer and a cast of supporting ones – is wrapped into a ultra-modern, Matrix-like, futuristic layer of striking multimedia visuals.</p>
<p>“This work observes the future of the human race with a critical gaze. It reveals tensions between contradictory and conflicting information in our physical life experiences. It also embodies the paradox of human condition as our species is transforming from the human to the post-human in the digital age,” says Bonansea. Referring to the extended cast employed in the work’s final incarnation, she explains: “Because OnlyHuman performances engaged local community as well as international audiences, I created a longer version including an eclectic cast of nine dancers completing the multimedia team, each bringing their own, unique moving history and potent presence.”</p>
<p>The show’s animated visuals are conceived and executed together with acclaimed photographerRobert Flynt, video and multimedia artist Yoann Trellu, and lighting designer Solomon Weisbard; the composer Nicole Carroll’s droning sounds create an aural environment for the performance. Originally developed as a solo performance with Bonansea as a main dancer, this iteration of the work features Mei Yamanaka in the lead and a supporting cast of nine dancers – including well-known New York performers Alvaro Estado, Maya Orchin, Becca Loevy, Amelia Heintzelman, Ichi Go, Cameron Mckinney, Charles Gowin, Kristopher K.Q. Pourzal, and Malcolm Betts.</p>
<p>OnlyHuman is presented as part of Danspace Project’s Community ACCESS which provides subsidized off-season rental opportunities for Danspace Project community members. The production was made possible in part with public funds from Creative Engagement, supported by the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs in partnership with the City Council and administered by LMCC.</p>
<p>Inclusion of an exceptional, eclectic cast, all with their own unique moving histories is imperative for this work. The work explores the human condition, and needs to expose “what it is to be human” through many lenses. These creative ambitions come with many financial setbacks, and the process of rehearsing and producing a piece with over 10 cast members and 3 additional collaboratoes has proved financially challenging for the company. We are in desperate need of additional funds to fairly compensate all artists, collaborators, and performers involved in the project.</p>
<p>WE NEED YOUR HELP!!</p>
<p>Donations no matter how big or small make a HUGE difference in the production of OnlyHuman. Here is what your donation goes towards: </p>
<p>$10 = equates to an hour of rehearsal space $25 = a dancers pay for one rehearsal </p>
<p>$50 = one costumes for cast members</p>
<p>$100 = six hours of administrative work </p>

<p>We are RANDOM ACTS!  We are a group of theatre professionals based in Southwest Florida. </p>
<p>Traditionally performing in the summer, when the theatre season is light, we are dedicated to the production of quality theatre, whether scripted plays, cabarets, burlesque, or any type of entertainment that might not get produced in the mainstream environment. Our main goal is attracting audiences to theatre experiences who might not ordinarily go to see plays, and develop a sense of the love and enjoyment of live performances!</p>
<p>Basically, we want to share the party…to hang out, enjoy art, music, theatre, good food, great spirits, and have fun.  Especially when we can make a statement.</p>

<h3>WHAT WE NEED</h3>
<p>It takes a village to raise a kid...and to put on a show.  We've partnered with <a href=""https://venicecare.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Compassionate Cannabis</a> and <a href=""http://http://www.regulateflorida.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Regulate Florida</a> to bring this off-Broadway sensation to Sarasota.  With their help, we have been able to acquire audio equipment, build costumes, and create flyers and help spread the word! We could not get to where we are today without them.  We need your help to get this project to the finish line!</p>
<p>We are looking for $6,000.00 to help off-set the costs of building the set and props ($1,750), musicians and sound design ($2,500), dance and fight choreography ($1,000) and lighting equipment and design ($500), and other production costs ($250).  If we meet this goal, not only would we be able to fully fund the production, but we would be able to compensate our actors, who have poured their hearts and souls into this project.  All of our production staff and actors work full-time jobs in addition to spending many weeknights and weekends doing what we love: creating theatre.</p>
<p> For your contributions at various levels, we are offering:</p>
<ul>
<li>Behind the scenes videos!</li>
<li>Photos and posters signed by the cast!</li>
<li>Canvas prints of REAL anti-marijuana propaganda art!</li>

<h3>WHY NOW?</h3>
<p>While we at Random Acts love having a good time and putting on a good show, we also are very passionate about the issues surrounding marijuana, particularly its legalization.  The history of marijuana's prohibition in this country is steeped in racism, xenophobia, and religious bigotry.</p>
<p>By 1936 (the year the original <i>Reefer Madness</i> was produced) Harry Anslinger had already become Head of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics and solicited stories of cannabis addiction to add to his ""Gore Files"" to build his case for a federal prohibition on cannabis. He relied on shock value, exaggerations, and outright untruth and in the end, he was successful.  The legacy that Anslinger left behind means that right now African Americans are 3.73 times more likely to be imprisoned for marijuana possession than white people (according to the <a href=""https://www.aclu.org/issues/mass-incarceration/smart-justice/war-marijuana-black-and-white"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ACLU</a>).  Do you believe that all Americans deserve to be treated equally under the law?  We do too.  That's why we want to use our love of theatre to educate the public.</p>

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p><i><strong>Body. </strong></i>is a devised production that theatricalizes true, personal stories about the relationships we have to the narratives of our bodies.  Through monologues, poetry, and movement rooted in Theatre of the Oppressed, <strong><i>Body. </i></strong>examines to what degree we are able to define that narrative for ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>Our Team</strong></p>
<p>Directed by<strong> Madeleine Regina</strong></p>
<p>Produced by <strong>Jennie Bissell</strong></p>

<h3>Why You Should Help</h3>
<p>From the first day of auditions, we've been moved by the (often previously unexpressed) stories held in each person's body.  Throughout the rehearsal process, we've become increasingly more aware of assumptions we make about others' physical forms and our own, and the deep need for a safe space to explore those narratives.  In an original piece rooted in honesty, humor, and expressive movement, we will invite our audiences to reexamine their relationship to their own bodies and those of others.  Ultimately, we aim to create a platform for further exploration, in a space where we as bear witness to the bodies of all.</p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Most Fringe productions make about $1,200 in ticket sales.  With 12 professional artists and original props, set, and costumes, we'll need your help to make Body. the moving production that it can be.</p>
<p>When you donate to the <strong><i>Body.</i></strong> campaign, you're contributing to the following expenses:</p>
<p>Promotion and Publicity (listings/ postings, graphic design, postcards): $830</p>
<p>Production (props, costumes, scenery, space rental): $940</p>
<p>Festival Fees/ Insurance: $865</p>

</h3>
<p dir=""ltr"">Nothing Without a Company (NWaC) has been producing free, traveling, site-specific theatre since 2005 in Chicago, IL. We have created and developed over 20 shows, collaborated with countless artists, and changed communities by bringing art to their everyday routines!</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">This summer NWaC is remounting the all-ages show “Alice.” Michael Wise adapted “Alice” from the book Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll in 2009 and changed the work this year to allow Alice to explore the wonderland of Chicago. “Alice” directed by Rose Freeman will take place in Lincoln Park near North Pond.</p>
<p>NWaC is raising funds for “Alice” to pay artists, designers, and performers. The funds will also go to production costs such as props, costumes, material, and puppets!</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p dir=""ltr"">To keep the costs down we have partnered with The Chicago Park District so NWaC needs $2,500.00 for “Alice.”</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Over $1,700.00 to pay artists, actors, production team, designers, wranglers, and more people!</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Around $800 for props, costumes, puppets, and anything else needed for the design elements!</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">For your generous donations you can get VIP or General Admission tickets to our annual gala, video thank you’s, cast photo, NWaC t-shirts, and much more!</p>
<p>NWaC is hosting this campaign through the run of “Alice” to maximize our donations! As you can see, most of our funds will be going to pay artists so if we don’t reach our entire goal the funds we raise here will go to the hardworking people of “Alice.” </p>

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>My name is Natasha Mumba and I am the coordinator and director of the Strivers Group; a group of theatre artists based in Montreal, QU at the National Theatre School of Canada. This Project has been in the making since I decided to pursue acting. I have always had a passion to teach theatre workshops back home in Zambia, not just as a training tool for an aspiring theatre artist but as an outlet for disadvantaged youth. A place where these young artists form low income families and also those living on the streets, could connect with people their age and join together to create and share stories too impact and change their lives. A few years ago, I found out about a theatre company in Zambia called the Barefeet Theatre Company; they are dedicated to helping youth get off the streets through the use of theatre. Every summer, since 2008, they host a festival performance where 2000 kids participate through acting, dancing and singing. The moment I found out about this program I contacted the artistic director, Adam Macguigan and told him we were interested in participating by hosting one of the workshops with the kids. After several e-mails we were please to have come to an agreement for a three week intensive workshop with thirty of the kids starting on July 15th and ending with a performance on August 3rd 2013.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Your support to this project is essential. With your gift you will be supporting us in sharing our knowledge of theatre with at risk youth in Lusaka, helping them hone and sharpen their skills of communication through theatre. This is an extremely powerful tool to have.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>I have a budget of $13,635 CAN in total and have already received responses from several different artists, organizations and grants that in total will give this project $5,000 CAN. The funds will be covering the costumes, rehearsal space, performance space, lights, transportation and travel expenses as this is an International project. Leaving $8,635.35 CAN to be covered. Your contribution and your participation to this project is highly appreciated. And your involvement will not end with just the donation but their will be a full documented package containing all the things accomplished during this project that will be available to you, as well as an acknowledgement of your participation in making this project come to life.</p>
<p>The original plan with this project; is to build a strong enough relationship with the Barefeet project to make our workshops annual. If we don’t meet our goal, we will maintain all the funds that we have earned and keep them in the project bank account and we will work toward the summer of 2014.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>My goal at the end of this is to have inspired these kids to begin telling their own stories and leave them with the tools to do it. I have created a syllabus involving  movement based on acting, singing and script work and with these elements, my peers and I have designed a structure that will hold the foundation of our project. We’re going to take their stories; their fears, their goals, things that move and inspire them and create individual devised pieces, which will be the life and core of the piece. Then as a collective we will combine all these individual elements through a theme that will be informed by the stories that they share.</p>

<div> </div>
<div>I am calling out to friends and family, to the local and international Dance community, professional and amateur...To artists of all genres.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I know from experience: The Dance community is a strong one... ANY style: Tango, Belly Dance, Hip Hop et al. I have seen dancers all over the world come together to make incredible things happen. I would like to channel that energy towards this dancer. Even if you don't know Stania personally I would love for you to do this for a fellow dancer.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>You will know that being unable to dance for any reason is a nightmare scenario. As dancers we need to dance, it's our passion, it's our lifeline. I believe we can help her through this difficult time by alleviating some of her financial worries.
<p>Stania has been through years of great discomfort with utmost poise and grace.  Three years ago Stania had an abdominal operation to remove fibroids from her womb, but unfortunately over the past 2 years the fibroids have returned causing  severe symptoms and great discomfort, and limiting her ability to work.<br/>   <br/> After consulting a variety of medical practioners, Stania was referred to a private surgeon to undertake the procedure, scheduled in early May, followed by 7 weeks recovery. The operation went well and she is now at home. She will not be able to get back to work for a while, which means no income until she has healed, as well as  fees owed for the surgery.</p>
<p>Although the financial cost of this operation was daunting, it was fundamental that she receive the best possible medical treatment for her condition in order to end this long and draining experience. <br/>   <br/> The operation cost £5,500, the total sum has been lent by a friend but she will need to pay it back. in order to support her financially through this challenging time, we have decided to host this fundraiser and various Tango events.  </p>
<p>I am sure any self employed artists out there will understand how much of a struggle making ends meet can be, add to this the pressure of paying medical fees.</p>
<p>Please forward this on to other friends and family, the wider we can spread the word the better, via Facebook, Twitter, Email, Phone Calls, Word of Mouth, any way possible!</p>
<p><strong>Perks:</strong></p>
<p>I am offering my first Tribal Fusion Private on line classes, one to one via Skype!</p>
<p>No matter where you are in the world, thanks to technology, we can practice together</p>
<p>You will find Tango perks on offer with the wonderful Fernando Guidi. <a href=""http://www.vidadetango.co.uk/aboutus/aboutus.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.vidadetango.co.uk/aboutus/aboutus.html</a></p>
<p>He is very kindly offering private lessons AND class cards for couples or singles (based in Devon). Perks for beginners and experienced Tango dancers alike.</p>
<p>As some of you know I make my own Raw Vegan Chocolates and will make up a few batches to send to UK backers should you choose that option (sorry I cannot ship my chocs overseas)</p>
<p>If you can only spare a quid, that's GREAT as I know times are tight for many of us these days. If each friend/follower/fan across social media platforms gave a little something, we could cover her medical fees and maybe even a little more to help Stania through her recovery. This campaign is very close to my heart, any contribution is GREATLY appreciated.</p>

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Our Story</span><br/>
</h3> <ul></ul>Against the dawning of the Machine Age, Edgar Allan Poe embarks on an obsessive, erotically charged love affair 
with poet Sarah Helen Whitman. But a fateful past encounter casts its 
shadow forward in time as inexorably as the hands of a clock, 
threatening to destroy their bridge to a new life with each other.<br/><br/><p>The initial staged reading of this musical, held in June of 2011 at the 
Bainbridge Museum of Art, received an extraordinarily positive response 
from an over-capacity audience and informed subsequent revisions of the 
script. <br/></p>
<p>Our second workshop reading took place on February 11, 2013 at 
the Center Theatre and featured 11 local actors, an orchestra of 3 and 
was attended by industry peers in an effort to flush out more of the 
script.  <b><i>The Hours of Life </i></b>is currently in the final stages of rewrites.</p>
<p><b><i>The Hours of Life </i></b>will be produced at the Cornish Studio Theatre (formerly the Intiman Black Box) December 5th -14th 2014 for a compressed run of 12 performances in only 10 Days.  </p>

 Against the dawning of the Machine Age, Edgar Allan Poe embarks on an obsessive, erotically charged love affair 
with poet Sarah Helen Whitman. But a fateful past encounter casts its 
shadow forward in time as inexorably as the hands of a clock, 
threatening to destroy their bridge to a new life with each other.The initial staged reading of this musical, held in June of 2011 at the 
Bainbridge Museum of Art, received an extraordinarily positive response 
from an over-capacity audience and informed subsequent revisions of the 
script. 
Our second workshop reading took place on February 11, 2013 at 
the Center Theatre and featured 11 local actors, an orchestra of 3 and 
was attended by industry peers in an effort to flush out more of the 
script.  The Hours of Life is currently in the final stages of rewrites.
The Hours of Life will be produced at the Cornish Studio Theatre (formerly the Intiman Black Box) December 5th -14th 2014 for a compressed run of 12 performances in only 10 Days.

What we need


Theatre22 has assembled a cast, crew, orchestra and producing team of 36 local artists, designers and musicians.  96% of our staffing has offered to ""volunteer"" their services towards the production in order to assist in this new work's launch and world premiere.  
 Your donation dollars, which are fully tax deductible, will go directly to the ARTISTS' FUND  to offer stipends and payments for their services and contributions. 
 
  The Impact 
Theatre22 wishes to contribute to the local reputation that Seattle is a regional powerhouse for new works in theatre.  
 
The Hours of Life will mark Theatre22's first new-works production and is the final production in their inaugural season.  Joining the ranks of the region's top theatre companies, Theatre22 is excited to contribute to Seattle's reputation of being a ""spring board"" for new plays, musicals, playwrights and artists.  
 
   Producing theatre is costly and risky.  Magnify the risks when working with new material that has not been tried, tested and audience approved.  Theatre22 embraces the challenges of producing new works by local playwrights and composers and gratefully accepts your support in these ventures.

<p>Our two companies have been flirting for a while now, and couldn't be happier to come together and produce together.  It is incredibly important to us to build community and work together to lift one another up.  By joining forces we will be able to accomplish so much more than if we stand alone.  <br/></p>
<p>Mastodon is led by Madison Comerzan, Jenna D'Angelo and Kim Krane.  The three met in college and since forming their company in 2013 have produced and acted in four shows in the city to sold out houses.  They proudly focus on producing work that is engaging, fun, thought provoking and fostering work with emerging artists.</p>
<p>Wide Eyed is led by Artistic Director Kristin Skye Hoffmann and Associate Artistic Director Stephanie C. Cunningham.  Wide Eyed has been producing in NYC for the last 8 years and exists to bring brave, bold and culturally relevant new texts to production.  With a core ensemble of emerging theatre artists they are dedicated to leaving audiences wide eyed. </p>
<p>KEEP is an incredible story about a young hoarder, Naomi. Naomi is trapped in her home by her own belongings, unable to throw anything away after losing her only friend, Margo. When Naomi’s sisters surprise her with an intervention, she is forced to start cleaning her home. Her sisters don’t realize, however, that Naomi blames them for Margo’s disappearance, and that her resentment towards them grows larger the longer they clean. As Naomi extracts her revenge—trapping her sisters in her home.  We have assembled an amazing team that will only continue to grow and expand.  Madison, Kim and Jenna will have roles in this ensemble piece with exquisite direction from the wonderful Stephanie C.

<h3>Our Story (...so far....)</h3>
<p>PARADOX is a radical approach to theater as a live event, as a historical reality, as an agent for education and change within a community and on the internet. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>
<em>We are a new Theater Company!</em> </h3>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""color: #333333;"">Joseph Campbell, following the writings of Carl Jung, argued for a very simple formula: Myths are public dreams and dreams are private myths. To this we can add that somewhere between our 'public dreams' and 'private myths,' there is Theater; and Theater is <em>how</em> we learn to believe.... Just as all good Fairy Tales begin with the <em>words</em> ""Once upon a time...""; all good plays and all good performances begin with the <em>idea</em> ""WHAT IF...""</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Do you remember the first time you went to see live theater? You found your way to a seat, settled in among the crowd. Then the lights flashed two or three times; they dimmed until the entire theater was dark. In that moment, all of us experienced both the memory of the last thing we saw and anticipation for the next thing we might see. This sensation that we have all experienced is the essence of PARADOX. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">PARADOX insists that Theater has always been at its roots, a mad conflation of ritual, myth, folk wisdom, improvisation, spectacle and song. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">PARADOX stands on the knife's edge of this tradition, not just between dark and light, known and unknown, past and future, but between anticipation and fulfillment.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">PARADOX is “…a radical approach to Theater,” dedicated to the idea ""WHAT IF""....</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> PARADOX presents:</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align: center;""><em>THE WRONG SIDE OF EDEN….</em></p>
<p align=""center"" class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align: center;"">A play by</p>
<p align=""center"" class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align: center;""> Kelly Knox, </p>
<p align=""center"" class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align: center;"">with Original Music by</p>
<p align=""center"" class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align: center;"">Christopher Boyd Tressler. </p>
<p align=""center"" class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""text-align: left;"">Lighting and Stage design by Michael Means</span> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Your contribution of any amount is greatly appreciated, not only to help us mount the current show, but to found the Theater Group PARADOX as well. Please keep reading, and follow us over the next several weeks as we strive to achieve our goals. </p>
<h3 class=""MsoNormal""><strong>About the Play: <em>The Wrong Side of Eden</em></strong></h3>
<p>Imagine that someone is trying to tell the simple story of Jack and the Beanstalk. All of a sudden the characters begin to act-out other stories—the stories from age-old ritual and myth, on which fairytales like Jack and the Beanstalk are based. This sudden, quite unexpected development leads us in new and very strange directions. At several points during the play <em>The Wrong Side of Eden,</em> the actors, the director, a mysterious chorus (led by an even more mysterious “Prologue”) and even the crew burst through the fourth wall. It is ""as if"" in their attempt to resolve the more puzzling aspects of theatrical story-telling, they are revealing the cultural and historical conflicts resident in fairytales, myths and plays; in effect, they ironically dissolve the various media that created them….</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Let's Get Started!<span style=""background-color: white; color: #333333;""> </span>
</h3>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""color: #333333;"">We project that our first show will cost $10,000 to produce; but we also realize that it will cost much more to launch a theater. PARADOX is a very BIG project. Fortunately we have a plan. We have divided our budget into four basic categories:</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""color: #333333;""><strong>First,  get organized: </strong> We will secure enough funding to file the paper work to start our theater company; we will fund our first show, put up a website, hold auditions and start rehearsals. The money we raise will also be used to create promotional items like t-shirts, posters and photos--some will be perks; all will be for sale soon, in a virtual or actual lobby near you....</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""color: #333333;""><strong>Second, find a temporary home: </strong>We will find a facility and everything practical; this includes rehearsal and performance space, lighting and equipment rentals, costumes and properties. This is not a ""little theater""; it is not a ""community theater""; we need to have a space that is our own, at least for the run of the show, where we can create, free from the limitations sometimes imposed on perofrmers in very conservative small towns.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""color: #333333;""><strong>Third, fill in the details:</strong> We will hire some personnel: to run the box office, the concessions and for security and maintenance. Of course it is very important that management of the company be set up legally so that every one is protected, everyone is insured against damages and injuries; and so there are as few disputes as possible over money.

PARADOX is a radical approach to theater as a live event, as a historical reality, as an agent for education and change within a community and on the internet. 



We are a new Theater Company! 
Joseph Campbell, following the writings of Carl Jung, argued for a very simple formula: Myths are public dreams and dreams are private myths. To this we can add that somewhere between our 'public dreams' and 'private myths,' there is Theater; and Theater is how we learn to believe.... Just as all good Fairy Tales begin with the words ""Once upon a time...""; all good plays and all good performances begin with the idea ""WHAT IF...""
Do you remember the first time you went to see live theater? You found your way to a seat, settled in among the crowd. Then the lights flashed two or three times; they dimmed until the entire theater was dark. In that moment, all of us experienced both the memory of the last thing we saw and anticipation for the next thing we might see. This sensation that we have all experienced is the essence of PARADOX. 
PARADOX insists that Theater has always been at its roots, a mad conflation of ritual, myth, folk wisdom, improvisation, spectacle and song. 
PARADOX stands on the knife's edge of this tradition, not just between dark and light, known and unknown, past and future, but between anticipation and fulfillment.
PARADOX is “…a radical approach to Theater,” dedicated to the idea ""WHAT IF""....
 PARADOX presents:
THE WRONG SIDE OF EDEN….
A play by
 Kelly Knox, 
with Original Music by
Christopher Boyd Tressler. 
Lighting and Stage design by Michael Means 
 
Your contribution of any amount is greatly appreciated, not only to help us mount the current show, but to found the Theater Group PARADOX as well. Please keep reading, and follow us over the next several weeks as we strive to achieve our goals. 
About the Play: The Wrong Side of Eden
Imagine that someone is trying to tell the simple story of Jack and the Beanstalk. All of a sudden the characters begin to act-out other stories—the stories from age-old ritual and myth, on which fairytales like Jack and the Beanstalk are based. This sudden, quite unexpected development leads us in new and very strange directions. At several points during the play The Wrong Side of Eden, the actors, the director, a mysterious chorus (led by an even more mysterious “Prologue”) and even the crew burst through the fourth wall. It is ""as if"" in their attempt to resolve the more puzzling aspects of theatrical story-telling, they are revealing the cultural and historical conflicts resident in fairytales, myths and plays; in effect, they ironically dissolve the various media that created them….


Let's Get Started! 

We project that our first show will cost $10,000 to produce; but we also realize that it will cost much more to launch a theater. PARADOX is a very BIG project. Fortunately we have a plan. We have divided our budget into four basic categories:
First,  get organized:  We will secure enough funding to file the paper work to start our theater company; we will fund our first show, put up a website, hold auditions and start rehearsals. The money we raise will also be used to create promotional items like t-shirts, posters and photos--some will be perks; all will be for sale soon, in a virtual or actual lobby near you....
Second, find a temporary home: We will find a facility and everything practical; this includes rehearsal and performance space, lighting and equipment rentals, costumes and properties. This is not a ""little theater""; it is not a ""community theater""; we need to have a space that is our own, at least for the run of the show, where we can create, free from the limitations sometimes imposed on perofrmers in very conservative small towns.
Third, fill in the details: We will hire some personnel: to run the box office, the concessions and for security and maintenance. Of course it is very important that management of the company be set up legally so that every one is protected, everyone is insured against damages and injuries; and so there are as few disputes as possible over money. This may mean consulting with a lawyer or an accountant.
Fourth,  plan our next steps: Some money will be set aside for sustaining the run of the show and for paying the performers and principals. Ideally, the actors will have a proportional share in the profits from the show. We will include the whole company in product and website development and in the profits.
 
The fine print: We are confident that we will meet our goals!  As is often the case, in non-profit and small start up companies, careful records have to be kept detailing where the money was spent and by whom; and investors or contributors have a right to ask to see those records. 
The really really uber fine print: We are of course crazy to try to do this in a very conservative small town--or in three very conservative small towns. It will either be a very very cool thing, or a great big steaming heap of @#$%; the good news is, either way you get to watch it step by step, frame by frame, scene by scene--on the web! Well almost....

It received various enthusiastic responses and stimulating questions from the audience. 

We are currently gathering funds to bring the piece to Jakarta as a part of the Women’s Festival at Teater Salihara, April 2012, to expand the dialogues on the pressing issues of sexuality, religion, and violence in Indonesia today.
 

The Play, the Political Context, and the Staging

Goyang Penasaran (The Obsessive Twist) is a play about Salimah, a female dangdut* singer from a small town, who has been admired, immortalized, and shunned by men. Set in the late 1990s, at the beginning of the Islamic resurgence in Indonesia, the story revolves around Salimah and her undying love for her old time religious teacher who now condemns her, and Solihin, who would do anything to have her after she humiliates him by refusing his proposal to take her as a second wife.

Goyang Penasaran (The Obsessive Twist) is a commentary on both the euphoria and the crisis of visibility after the downfall of Suharto’s authoritarian regime. After a long suppression by the regime, celebrations of sexuality as well as various expressions of Muslim public piety are now inseparable from the democratization package. On the bleaker side, the public sphere is now crowded with some groups who, in the name of religion, conduct violence against symbols of moral decadence, from dangdut shows to LGBT conferences and festivals.

Public policies ranging from the fatwas, the shariah laws, to the controversial Pornography Law testify for the anxieties around visibility that produce the question of what is allowed to be seen and what not.“Seeing,” thus, is a central motif in the play. Goyang Penasaran (The Obsessive Twist) poses a question on the economy of seeing/being seen within the intricate relationship between the sexuality discourse, politics, religion, and violence. 

Exploring the possibilities in which the spectator could critically challenge their gaze on the condemned and eroticized body of a dangdut singer, the play experiments with an old tradition in theater: the cross-dressing practice. The performance deploys four male actors to play Solihin, Haji Ahmad the religious teacher, the thugs, and Salimah herself. Stylistically, it is an homage to classic Indonesian horror films and the heyday of dangdut music from the 1970s-1980s.

*Dangdut is a genre of Indonesian popular music that combines Malay, Arabic, Indian, Western, and Latin musical elements. Throughout the history it has been associated with the underclass, commodified, and politicized. In the past decade erotic dangdut dance has been part of the debates of national morality and religion. 

 
The Team and the History 
Goyang Penasaran (The Obsessive Twist) was first written as a short story by Intan Paramaditha, published in an anthology Kumpulan Budak Setan / The Devil Slaves Club (Jakarta: Gramedia Pustaka Utama, 2010). She and theater director Naomi Srikandi were involved in a discussion forum on gender and sexuality in the Symposium on Performance in Indonesia (Yogyakarta 2009). The forum participants discussed how the long list of discriminations against women and LGBT groups in the public sphere reveals that sexuality is a crucial site that reflects contemporary realities in Indonesia: the tension between civil society, frictions within the ideas of nationhood, and the pervasive sense of disbelief that characterizes the relationship between the citizens and the state.

Intan and Naomi decided to respond to these issues by committing themselves in the collaborative project Goyang Penasaran (The Obsessive Twist). They adapted Intan’s short story into a play, which would then be directed by Naomi. The complete team of Goyang Penasaran consists of Agung Kurniawan (art director), Ari Dwianto (actor), Ignatius Sugiarto (lighting and technical director), Intan Paramaditha (author of the original story, playwright), Irfanuddien Ghozali (actor), MN Qomaruddin (actor), Naomi Srikandi (playwright, director), Rifqi Mansur Maya (stage manager), Risky Summerbee (soundscape composer), Theodorus Christanto (actor, assistant director), Vidyahana Sinaga (costume and makeup artist), with production management by Ratri Kartika Sari and Teater Garasi.

The Impact
We situate our project as a part of cultural activist works that promote freedom to express diverse voices in Indonesian society precisely when, as more clearly shown in the recent years, the state has failed to protect the basic rights of the individual, including the right not to be violated by others. As a complement to the performance we would also organize a discussion on how the performance of religion in public has been discussed and questioned in literature and theater in the past decade. With your donation you are supporting theater both as a form of artistic expression and cultural activism.

<h3>""Diary of a Mid-Life Crisis""<br/>
</h3>After almost 18 years in an emotionally abusive relationship, I decided to start my life over again.  Not an easy thing to do at 43.  <br/><br/>Because my friends were interested in what was going on with me, I did what everyone else was doing - I started a blog.  <a href=""http://diaryofamidlifecrisis.blogspot.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://diaryofamidlifecrisis.blogspot.com</a><br/><br/>I figured the dozen people in my immediate circle would be the ones to read it, that no one else would be interested.  <br/><br/>I was wrong.  I started getting comments from women (and men) around the world who had started their lives over or were struggling with an abusive situation or just struggling with trying to figure out life.  <br/><br/>After a great deal of encouragement, I decided to turn this little meandering missive into a stage play.<br/><br/>And so here we are.<br/><br/>""Diary of a Mid-Life Crisis"" follows one woman as she begins the journey to rediscover her life.  She deals with her emotionally abusive ex and the tangle of emotions that follow her as she tries to push away the past in order to find her future.  She discovers love - platonic, unrequited and everything in between.  She even has a few close encounters with Jesus... but not in the way you'd think.  Oh, and there will be bad poetry.  Consider yourself warned.<br/><br/>Along the way, she discovers that there are no big answers, only a million tiny ones along the way.<br/><br/>Of course, ""Diary"" won't be your typical one woman ""oh, sad me in a spotlight with a microphone"" show.  Nope. There will be clowns - mean, nasty ones that live in her head.  Sock puppets.  Martial arts.  And a pie fight.  Maybe two.  <br/>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>There is a universality in ""Diary"" that reaches across gender and age.  
We all struggle to figure out just who the hell we are and how the hell 
we fit into the world.  As well, the issue of emotional abuse is often not discussed and it is a topic that needs to be brought to light.  <br/></p>

<p>I intend to donate 16% of any profits to Sojourn, a shelter for women who are victims of domestic violence.</p>

<p>The opening night performance will also be dedicated to Sojourn and a special fundraising effort will happen for that evening.<br/></p>

<br/>I need to raise $300 for a deposit on the theater to get the show locked.  I am a resident director at Eclectic Company Theatre, where the show will be performed, but I do still need to put money down to hold my dates.  If I don't raise the money, I may be in danger of losing my production dates.<br/><br/>If I raise more than $300, anything over and above that will go to paying production costs - paying the stage manager and designers, actors, etc.  I get paid last so I won't see any money out of this fundraising push.<br/><br/>Any amount will help.  $5, $10, $250 or $500.  Skip your latte and help small theater!<br/><p><br/></p>

</div>The Show</b>
<p><i>The Weaver of Raveloe</i> is a new musical by Erica Glenn and Melissa Leilani Larson based on George Eliot's <i>Silas Marner</i>. The musical tells the timeless story of a reclusive weaver who must flee his hometown after he is accused of murder.  Silas is forced to confront past ghosts and re-discover the importance of human connection in this classic tale of love, loss, and healing. </p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Learn more at </span><a href=""http://www.weaverofraveloe.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""line-height: 1.45em;"" target=""_blank"">weaverofraveloe.com</a><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">.

<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 30px;"">Our Journey</span>
<p>The journey of a musical to the stage always begins with an idea, with a spark of inspiration. Composer, lyricist, and book co-writer Erica Glenn (<a href=""http://www.ericaglenn.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ericaglenn.com</a>) recalls how she came to write <i>The Weaver of Raveloe</i>:
</p><blockquote> I remember pulling George Eliot's <u>Silas Marner</u> from a dusty corner years ago and falling quickly and irreversibly in love with this literary gem. Accused of a crime he didn't commit and abandoned by the woman he loves, Silas becomes a reclusive weaver in a village with secrets of its own--secrets which ultimately drive him to confront the ghosts of his past. Primarily a multi-layered love story, <i>Silas Marner</i> is also a parable of industrialization, a morality tale, and a good, old-fashioned drama. It combines the sweeping themes of a story like <u>Les Miserables</u> with the psychological depth of one like<u>The Secret Garden</u>. It is a drama of epic proportions that somehow never loses its intimacy and humanity—a musical just waiting to be written.</blockquote>

In 2010, the first incarnation of the script was workshopped at Brigham Young University under the direction of George Nelson. The following year, the Salty Cricket Composers Collective performed excerpts from the show at the Rose Wagner Performing Arts Center. In 2012, <i>The Weaver of Raveloe</i> was accepted to the prestigious New York Musical Theatre Festival as a developmental reading. The show had three unstaged performances off-off-Broadway at the 45th Street Theater that July and received extensive feedback from audience members and industry professionals. <p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/457141/files/20140324155116-45th_St_Theatre_1.jpg?1395701476"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>So far on this journey, the musical has received media coverage at <a href=""http://broadwayworld.com/article/THE-WEAVER-OF-RAVELOE-To-Be-Featured-In-NYMF-711-714-20120709"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">BroadwayWorld.com</a> and <a href=""http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865560871/LDS-composer-performs-musical-on-NYC-stage.html?pg=all"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Deseret News</i></a>.

We'd like to join that gang.After the Edinburgh Fringe, Shakespeare's VILLAINS will return to Los Angeles for a full run. What We Need & What You GetThe CSE has never asked for donations before; we've always funded our productions from ticket revenue and commissions...we're fundraising NOW because this is way bigger than anything we've done before, and we're growing!The funding goes to everything from venue rental to travel arrangements to promotion. A lot of factors have to come together for our three week odyssey, which is why getting ourselves sorted financially is crucial. By donating to this campaign you'll bring Shakespeare's VILLAINS to the international stage. By supporting the project, you can also get perks like tickets to a performance of the show in Los Angeles, all the way up to private performances. If you're more of a merch-minded type, we've got mugs, shirts and scripts available too!If, by some misfortune, we don't fulfill our goal on Indiegogo and literally every last thing falls through for this project financially, left-over funds will go to the California Shakespeare Ensemble for our local remount of VILLAINS, and everyone still gets their nifty perks. So it's a win-win situation!The ImpactThe impact of your donation is literally the difference between going to Edinburgh for the Fringe Fest on one hand, and not going on the other. The TeamThe California Shakespeare Ensemble is a group of professional actors who work in TV, Film and Theater in Los Angeles. The Ensemble performs classical theater and new works, and is also part of the public programming of Descanso Gardens. More about the Ensemble: www.californiashakespeare.org The cast includes: J.R.

</h3><p></p><p><b><i>Introduction</i></b></p><p>It is
with joy and great anticipation that we would like to announce to you the new
program by the Austin Eurythmy Ensemble: <i>Project Zero Circle: - beginnings</i>.
We are inviting you to join the birthing process of this new artistic
project; to nurture our forces of initiative with your freely given donation.
By investing in this new impulse you will have the opportunity to co-create
with us the future seeds for the Art of Eurythmy.</p>
<p><span><b><i>Project </i></b></span></p><p><span>The members of this project
include: Andrea and Markus Weder, <i>eurythmists; </i>Jeremiah Turner, <i>speech
artist; </i>Risa Ando, <i>violinist </i>and Jun Seo, <i>cellist. </i>The
<i>Project Zero Circle: - beginnings </i>performance will be performed in two parts
with a short intermission. The first part consists of an interwoven sequence of
<i>poetry by Denis Levertov</i> and the <i>Sonata for Violin and Cello by
Maurice Ravel</i>. We feel the outspoken beauty of this poetry acutely reflects
the consciousness of our time, in its spiritual meaning and its bold structure;
it is truly prophetic poetry for the 21<sup>st</sup>
century. The composition by Maurice Ravel presents us with a full palette of
feelings in its varied colors and moods: from delicate lyricism to moments of
joyful exuberance to expressions of deep sorrow and pain – the highest and
lowest parts of our human existence. The second part of the program continues
the exploration of our inner lives:  <i>Japanese Tankas </i>(modern,
short Haikus) and the <i>Preludes for Violoncello by Sofia Gubaidulina</i><b>. </b>The
Tankas are poignant imaginations of soul events, at times poetic and
transcendent and in other instances absurd and humorous.  The pieces for
violoncello are contemporary, short and succinct, a lively adventure into new
soul and soundscapes.</span></p>
<p></p><p><b><i>Background</i></b></p><p><i>Andrea Weder </i>was born in Germany. Andrea graduated from the London School of
Eurythmy after previous training and free- lance work as a sculptor. <i>Markus Weder </i>was born in Switzerland, where he studied curative
education before training Eurythmy at the “Akademie fuer Eurythmische Kunst” in
Dornach, Switzerland, and at “Eurythmy Spring Valley”, NY.  <i>Andrea and Markus </i>toured together internationally as performers, directors and
master teachers with Eurythmy Spring Valley (from 1991- 1996) and the Austin
Eurythmy Ensemble (since 1996). They taught for ten years as
Artist-In-Residence at the Austin Waldorf School. Andrea and Markus are the
founders and Artistic Directors of the Austin Eurythmy Ensemble and initiated
the Austin Youth Eurythmy Troupe (AWS High School Eurythmy Troupe, 1999- 2007)
and the “International Summer Eurythmy Academy” (2003- 2007). Since 2008 they
have been the Project Leaders of the new professional full-time eurythmy
training “im- pulse. eurythmy, International Eurythmy Studies<i>”</i> in
Austin, USA and Dornach, Switzerland. They are currently free- lancing
as performing eurythmists for the <i>Project Zero Circle - beginnings </i>production.</p><p><b><i>Campaign</i></b></p><p>With this campaign we are searching funding for production costs and touring expenditures. We are planning to premier our project on March 29, 2014 in Austin, TX and to bring it on tour to venues in California, Switzerland (Goetheanum, Dornach) and Scotland in May/ June 2014. Parts of the funding will also be dedicated for a new documentary video about our work and striving with this project. </p><p>We are offering our performances on tour for the first time with the gift- economy idea.

</p><p><b><i>Mission</i></b></p><p>The Austin Eurythmy Ensemble
cherishes the spiritual wisdom of the human body in motion. By promoting social
harmony and spiritual renewal, we seek to achieve individual, cultural, and
global transformation. Rooted in the tradition of eurythmy as inaugurated by
Rudolf Steiner and yet contemporary in artistic approach, the Ensemble intends
to make this art form a relevant part of today’s cultural life. We are carrying
eurythmy into the future by performing internationally and educating future
generations of eurythmists. Our envisioned state- of-the- arts rehearsal and
performance center will include an International Eurythmy Academy. This center
will serve as a meeting place for visual, literary, and performing artists to
inspire each other and for the spiritually curious and artistically inclined to
build community.</p>
<p></p><p><b><i>History</i></b></p>
<p><span>The Austin Eurythmy
Ensemble (<a href=""http://www.austineurythmy.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.austineurythmy.org</a>) was
founded in 1996. As a performing eurythmy troupe they have initiated incredibly
satisfying performance work, whirlwind tours, amazing professional and artistic
collaboration as well as important alliances and relationships.</span></p>
<p>  Over the course of years, the ensemble has grown on many
different levels from their beginnings as a 4-member troupe moving from Spring
Valley, New York, to Austin, Texas, into a mature troupe of professional
artists complete with a devoted Circle of Friends and deeply satisfying
professional relationships. </p>
<p>  Having been granted the unique position of
artists-in-residence upon their arrival in the US, Markus and Andrea Weder have
been able to continue their work as professional eurythmists while at the same
time enjoying the inspiring and challenging work of teaching eurythmy at the
Austin Waldorf School (1996- 2007).  Providing the school with
consistent, high quality eurythmy instruction, which resulted in programs such
as the Austin Youth Eurythmy Troupe (1999- 2007), an extra-curricular high
school troupe, and the first ever International High School Eurythmy Festival
(2004). All this is stemming from, and nurturing a particular passion of the
eurythmists to work intensely with youth. </p>
<p>  Since their inception, the group has produced and
performed over five different evening programs and numerous children’s
programs, traveling across the U.S., Canada and Europe in at least ten
extensive performance tours.  Much to their delight, audiences have been
very receptive, and generous with praise, commenting on the depth, eloquence,
sophistication, precision and quality of cohesion that the ensemble brings to
the stage.</p>
<p>  It is important to point out the relationships these
eurythmists have cultivated and enjoyed with their collaborative artists, for
the nature of their art is to make visible the world of music and speech. Their
creations have only been made possible through these indispensable and
inspiring collaborations with supporting musicians and speech artists. These
fellow artists have offered their talent and expertise in helping to shape the
ensemble into its present form.  </p>
<p>  The
ensemble has always pursued many opportunities to further develop the presence
of eurythmy in the world.  Along those lines, one of the most important
manifestations has been the Summer Eurythmy Academy (2003- 2007 in the US,
Brazil, South Africa and Switzerland).  In these recurring month-long
intensives, graduates of Waldorf education could more fully explore the art of
eurythmy as it relates not only to performance work, but also to
self-development. The momentum of this work inspired the initiation of a new
professional eurythmy training. </p>
<p> The
im-pulse.eurythmy, International Eurythmy Studies (<a href=""http://www.impulse-eurythmy.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.impulse-eurythmy.org</a>) was inaugurated in 2008. It is
a completely new approach to a professional eurythmy training on the college
level. In addition to Austin, TX, the home base of the training, students travelled
to campuses in Dornach, Switzerland and Sao Paolo, Brazil. The first course
(2008- 2011) was specially tailored to the needs of Waldorf School Alumni from
the U.S., Brazil and Switzerland with prior extensive experience in eurythmy.
This three year long, full- time course is recognized by the Section for
Eurythmy, Speech, Drama and Music at the Goetheanum, Dornach, Switzerland, the
worldwide center of the Eurythmy movement.</p>
<p>  In another effort to bring eurythmy
to more visibility, the ensemble has branched out into the public sphere with
workshops, lecture/demonstrations, and public performances at local venues such
as theaters and museums.  With the new <i>Project Zero Circle: -beginnings</i>
more of such work is envisioned </p>
<p>  As they continue touring and performing
and mentoring youth, the ensemble remains devoted to bringing eurythmy ever
more fully into human consciousness. </p>

What is Eurythmy:
What is only heard is partly hidden.
The rustle of the leaves gently swaying in the
wind, the flap of the bird’s rapid ascent, the sigh of a contented child.
There is a deeper experience of sound, one that
arises out of our most intimate connection to the world – to the earth, to each
other, to the intangible qualities of being alive.  The inner life of sound reveals visible form.
“As in the ear, so also in the eye.”
The fullness of the words of the poet, the
static form of the pianist’s ode – these are portals into the fluid sculpture
that speech and music create in the physical space of our world.
Eurythmy is harmonious rhythm.  
The eurythmist, by observing the structural
laws of speech and music, reveals the inner life of language and sound,
creating a composition that uses the stage as a three-dimensional canvas.
By joining with that which moves through the
air as tone or language, the eurythmist harmonizes with sound.
In this way, the body is an instrument.  It is no different than a flute or a violin,
no different than a voice.  Through
skilled observation of the laws inherent in speech and music, eurythmy makes
visible the invisible form of sound.
Eurythmy is not interpretation; it is a true
sounding or singing through the body.

A Broadway Play by Kyle Sugarman,
Kyle Sugarman, a 16-year-old from Fort Collins, CO, writes a 456-page play that
he's sure will be the biggest hit in the history of Broadway. Rejected by his
father, the girl he loves, and Broadway itself, Kyle takes matters into his own
hands – embarking on an adventure as funny, touching, and surprising as the
play he’s written.
Spacebar will have its New York premiere at The Wild Project in the East Village from October 24 - November 8, 2014, in a production directed by
Maggie Burrows and designed by Dane Laffrey. (Purchase tickets here!)

</h3><p>You’re cordially invited to
assist us in the realization of the wedding plans for Anthony Pinnunziato &amp; Andrew Polinski, both of whom are coming together (which is how it always
should be) at the Montreal Fringe, June 12 to 22, 2014. </p>
<p>The play satirizes the
controversy surrounding same-sex marriage while drawing on larger than life gay
and Italian-American characters. Playwright Anthony J. Wilkinson’s off-Broadway
mega-smash hit (ongoing in NYC since 2003) is a fast paced wacky - zany comedy (à la sitcom) absurd farce set in
Brooklyn NYC, June 2011. This project is equally as entertaining as it is
informative, educating everyone on the subject matter it deals with. This character driven piece
allows the audience to laugh along with but not at the personas being portrayed, in a non-judgmental format that leaves all of the participants with plenty of ‘food for thought’ a buffet of insight and introspective begging the question…
‘what’s all the fuss really all about?’</p>
<p>In order to bring this production from the page to the stage we need your participation.
When it comes to planning and preparing for a theatrical production the need for support often extends far beyond the capacity of the organizing team creating that project. We’re organizing a wedding within a theatre production, doubling the efforts normally required for each objective and outcome, there-for  greater assistance to fulfill those needs. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Our famiglia (family) will greatly
appreciate any and all assistance in helping us to create a great wedding for Anthony &amp; Andrew promising you an equally entertaining and  educational </span>experience<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> for all of those who
attend it in June. </span></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The funds raised will go directly to not only increase </span>awareness<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> but also to cover: 1) The cost of
adequate safe conveniently located rehearsal space. With a cast of over 15 local artists, our own kitchens and
living rooms are a just too cramped (we know, we’ve tried.) in size.  2) The cost of some of the basic accountable fixed costs of production including, performance fee rights to the play, the venue, and technical production team costs </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">. 3) Printing and publicity. Media release invitations, flyers and programs and
posters. All required </span>in-order<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> to draw attention and bring awareness  about the pending
nuptials of Anthony &amp; Andrew. 4) To ensure that at the end of the day, there is
enough box office receipts balanced to share and distribute to our generous and talented </span><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">famiglia</i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> of performing artists.</span></p>
<p>Your contributions, none are too large or too small, will be rewarded by being a part of something truly BIG! Become a member
of our production dream team, the <i>famiglia</i> of My BIG
Gay Italian Wedding. You’ll become a part of something really BIG while helping others
experience something truly special. Come OUT and join us during the production’s

<p><b><i>The Pinnunizato family embark on a BIG gay adventure when their only
son Anthony Pinnunziato, a gay Italian-American from a large chaotic family,
wants to marry his boyfriend Andrew Polinski in a traditional Italian wedding
ceremony. Anthony's mother Angela won't give her blessing unless
Andrew's estranged mother also gives her blessing and the ceremony is performed
by the family priest Father Rosalia. Matters are further complicated by Andrew's ex-boyfriend
Gregorio Salinary who's intent on interfering with the plans, and Mario Nicastro, Anthony's
best-man, who's determined to break up the couple. -What could possibly go
wrong when everyone wants to get involved and help out with the wedding plans? Everything
that's what! Come OUT, and be a guest at our BIG show. </i></b></p>

allows the audience to laugh along with but not at the personas being portrayed, in a non-judgmental format that leaves all of the participants with plenty of ‘food for thought’ a buffet of insight and introspective begging the question…
‘what’s all the fuss really all about?’
In order to bring this production from the page to the stage we need your participation.
When it comes to planning and preparing for a theatrical production the need for support often extends far beyond the capacity of the organizing team creating that project. We’re organizing a wedding within a theatre production, doubling the efforts normally required for each objective and outcome, there-for  greater assistance to fulfill those needs. Our famiglia (family) will greatly
appreciate any and all assistance in helping us to create a great wedding for Anthony & Andrew promising you an equally entertaining and  educational experience for all of those who
attend it in June. The funds raised will go directly to not only increase awareness but also to cover: 1) The cost of
adequate safe conveniently located rehearsal space. With a cast of over 15 local artists, our own kitchens and
living rooms are a just too cramped (we know, we’ve tried.) in size.  2) The cost of some of the basic accountable fixed costs of production including, performance fee rights to the play, the venue, and technical production team costs . 3) Printing and publicity. Media release invitations, flyers and programs and
posters. All required in-order to draw attention and bring awareness  about the pending
nuptials of Anthony & Andrew. 4) To ensure that at the end of the day, there is
enough box office receipts balanced to share and distribute to our generous and talented famiglia of performing artists.
Your contributions, none are too large or too small, will be rewarded by being a part of something truly BIG! Become a member
of our production dream team, the famiglia of My BIG
Gay Italian Wedding. You’ll become a part of something really BIG while helping others
experience something truly special. Come OUT and join us during the production’s
run during the Fringe. See production schedule and posted information below.
Grazie!
The Pinnunizato family embark on a BIG gay adventure when their only
son Anthony Pinnunziato, a gay Italian-American from a large chaotic family,
wants to marry his boyfriend Andrew Polinski in a traditional Italian wedding
ceremony. Anthony's mother Angela won't give her blessing unless
Andrew's estranged mother also gives her blessing and the ceremony is performed
by the family priest Father Rosalia. Matters are further complicated by Andrew's ex-boyfriend
Gregorio Salinary who's intent on interfering with the plans, and Mario Nicastro, Anthony's
best-man, who's determined to break up the couple. -What could possibly go
wrong when everyone wants to get involved and help out with the wedding plans? Everything
that's what! Come OUT, and be a guest at our BIG show. 
It's gonna be !

<h3>The Hours That Remain</h3>
<p>In fall 2012 we will premiere Metis playwright Keith Barker's moving play The Hours That Remain for audiences in Saskatoon and Toronto.  Haunted by the disappearance of her sister five years ago, Denise desperately seeks answers where she can.  A story of enduring love and a testament to the relentless hope evinced by families of missing women everywhere.  We are proud to partner with Saskatchewan Native Theatre Company to stage this beautiful play.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Story of the Play</h3>
<p>The Hours That Remain has been developed over the past two years with workshops and readings by Native Earth Performing Arts, Foundry Theatre and New Harlem Productions.  It has been dramaturged by DM St. Bernard and Isaac Thomas.  It has been read at Springworks Festival in Stratford and Weesageechak Begins to Dance Festival in Toronto.  Like all good plays, it has been raised by the village.  We hope you will join us in bringing it to the stage for its premiere production under the exquisite direction of David Storch.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Here's the Deal</h3>
<div>We are grateful to have secured the partnership of Saskatchewan Native Theatre Company in producing this play.  New Harlem is a small company with mighty ambition.  We are asking for your help to get the show over to Saskatoon where it will be welcomed with open ... risers?  The fundraising amount above represents the cost of airfare for the creative team from Toronto to Saskatchewan.   In exchange for your contribution, we hope you will accept a little piece of Hours for your very own.  Also, we will love you so hard you will feel it in your socks.</div>

</h3><p>Written by Fiona Lakeland  - Directed by Adrian LaTourelle </p><p>Starring Fiona Lakeland, Melanie Alexander and Jeff Bowman</p><p>WHO WE ARE AND WHAT WE DO! </p><ul><li>Hi Everyone! We are Fermented Apples! On our team we've got, Fiona Lakeland (writer/actress/creator/producer), Kimberly Connolly (collaborator/creator), Jeff Bowman (actor), Melanie Alexander (actress), and Adrian LaTourelle (director/creator).</li></ul><ul><li>This year we will be bringing <a href=""http://hff14.org/1620"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">CAN'T TAKE MY (EYES) OFF OF YOU</a> to <a href=""http://hff14.org/1620"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Theatre of NOTE</a> for our second year in The Hollywood Fringe Festival! </li></ul><ul>
<li>The story centers around the relationship between Holly and Stefan, and then Katherine, who is Stefan's best friend, and the tensions that arise because she's a girl…</li>
<li>It's really Holly's story, though. She meets Stefan when she has a lot going on in her life. Her dad is dying, she never really knew him, and she very quickly falls in love with him, and their relationship develops at a pace that is probably a little bit faster than either of them expected it would be…She finally realizes that she may have gotten herself into something a little too quickly that, now, she's not sure that she can really go through with. </li>
<li>The main point of the piece is knowing how to stay true to yourself. Being able to recognize when we are caught in situations that are uncomfortable or foreign to what we know and really staying true to who we are in those moments, and sometimes having to make some drastic decisions in spite of all that. </li>
<li>The script has changed quite a bit from the beginning which is a natural part of the process. As the characters start to reveal themselves to the writer the story changes and that's all great!  </li>
<li>We've already got people really excited about it! We've got reviewers coming to our first couple shows from <a href=""http://bitter-lemons.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bitter Lemons</a> and <a href=""http://examiner.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Examiner.com</a>, we've got people tweeting about us, and we've even got the fantastic support of the LAFPI, which is the <a href=""http://lafpi.com/about/women-at-work-onstage/women-on-the-fringe/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""The LA Female Playwright's Initiative""</a>! </li>
<li>All that being said, we just need a little bit of help making everything come together in our final stages of production. Your donation will help us cover the cover the cost of the venue…We're doing the show at <a href=""http://theatreofnote.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Theatre of NOTE</a> which is in Hollywood, and it's a really great space in a 42 seat Black Box theatre. It will also help us cover the cost of the registration, the printing of postcards, and all of our props and costumes!</li>
</ul><ul><li>We are so excited to bring this show to the Hollywood Fringe this year and we hope that you'll consider making a small donation. Thank you so much and have a great day!</li></ul><p>A LITTLE MORE ABOUT FERMENTED APPLES AND WHAT WE'RE ALL ABOUT</p><ul><li>Last year, we created our first original World-Premiere play called STRANDED in which we explored Sexual Abuse and it's Effects on Mental Health. The play was  inspired by Journals and Writings of Sylvia Plath and Marilyn Monroe, also written by Fiona Lakeland and directed by Adrian LaTourelle from a collaboration with Kimberly Connolly</li></ul><ul><li>With Fiona Lakeland as Lucy, and Kimberly Connolly as Annabelle, <a href=""http://hff13.org/1337"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">STRANDED</a> received rave reviews such as: ""This is a show that should be seen!"" -Bob Leggett, Examiner.com, ""Sure to be a festival favorite! This duo is both talented and bold."" -John W., ""Intense and talented performances. I left invigorated!"" -Josh Hillinger, and ""I was gripping my arm rests the entire play."" -Grant P…just to name a few!</li></ul><ul><li>Fiona says, on working with her team, ""Kim and Adrian and I, we just get each other artistically and it's rare that you find that with another actor/director on such a deep level. We are excited to welcome Jeff and Melanie to the team. We've all got an incredible passion, love and respect for each other's work!"" </li></ul><p></p><p></p><h3>WHAT WE NEED &amp; WHAT YOU GET</h3><p>In order to bring CAN'T TAKE MY (EYES) OFF OF YOU to the Fringe this year, we need your help.

<li>We believe that the Theatre is the best way to provoke thought, to inspire change, and to give a voice to the people.</li>
<li>Fermented Apples was created to serve as a platform for asking and addressing uncomfortable, yet essential questions and topics through new works in the Theatre. <a href=""http://hff14.org/1620"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">CAN'T TAKE MY EYES OFF OF YOU</a> is universal to people of all ages. It is a piece that weighs on the importance of staying true to who you are no matter what your circumstances whether with a loved one, with a boss, or even with a friend! </li>
<li>Last year we raised $1360 for STRANDED and it was a huge success! Because of the subject matter of <a href=""https://vimeo.com/75668041"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">STRANDED</a>, How Sexual Abuse Affects Mental Health, we were able to give a voice to the victims of Sexual Abuse and make a mark that raised awareness of this Silent, yet ever present epidemic. </li>

Written by Fiona Lakeland  - Directed by Adrian LaTourelle Starring Fiona Lakeland, Melanie Alexander and Jeff BowmanWHO WE ARE AND WHAT WE DO! Hi Everyone! We are Fermented Apples! On our team we've got, Fiona Lakeland (writer/actress/creator/producer), Kimberly Connolly (collaborator/creator), Jeff Bowman (actor), Melanie Alexander (actress), and Adrian LaTourelle (director/creator).This year we will be bringing CAN'T TAKE MY (EYES) OFF OF YOU to Theatre of NOTE for our second year in The Hollywood Fringe Festival! 
The story centers around the relationship between Holly and Stefan, and then Katherine, who is Stefan's best friend, and the tensions that arise because she's a girl…
It's really Holly's story, though. She meets Stefan when she has a lot going on in her life. Her dad is dying, she never really knew him, and she very quickly falls in love with him, and their relationship develops at a pace that is probably a little bit faster than either of them expected it would be…She finally realizes that she may have gotten herself into something a little too quickly that, now, she's not sure that she can really go through with. 
The main point of the piece is knowing how to stay true to yourself. Being able to recognize when we are caught in situations that are uncomfortable or foreign to what we know and really staying true to who we are in those moments, and sometimes having to make some drastic decisions in spite of all that. 
The script has changed quite a bit from the beginning which is a natural part of the process. As the characters start to reveal themselves to the writer the story changes and that's all great!  
We've already got people really excited about it! We've got reviewers coming to our first couple shows from Bitter Lemons and Examiner.com, we've got people tweeting about us, and we've even got the fantastic support of the LAFPI, which is the ""The LA Female Playwright's Initiative""! 
All that being said, we just need a little bit of help making everything come together in our final stages of production. Your donation will help us cover the cover the cost of the venue…We're doing the show at Theatre of NOTE which is in Hollywood, and it's a really great space in a 42 seat Black Box theatre. It will also help us cover the cost of the registration, the printing of postcards, and all of our props and costumes!
We are so excited to bring this show to the Hollywood Fringe this year and we hope that you'll consider making a small donation. Thank you so much and have a great day!A LITTLE MORE ABOUT FERMENTED APPLES AND WHAT WE'RE ALL ABOUTLast year, we created our first original World-Premiere play called STRANDED in which we explored Sexual Abuse and it's Effects on Mental Health. The play was  inspired by Journals and Writings of Sylvia Plath and Marilyn Monroe, also written by Fiona Lakeland and directed by Adrian LaTourelle from a collaboration with Kimberly ConnollyWith Fiona Lakeland as Lucy, and Kimberly Connolly as Annabelle, STRANDED received rave reviews such as: ""This is a show that should be seen!"" -Bob Leggett, Examiner.com, ""Sure to be a festival favorite! This duo is both talented and bold."" -John W., ""Intense and talented performances. I left invigorated!"" -Josh Hillinger, and ""I was gripping my arm rests the entire play."" -Grant P…just to name a few!Fiona says, on working with her team, ""Kim and Adrian and I, we just get each other artistically and it's rare that you find that with another actor/director on such a deep level. We are excited to welcome Jeff and Melanie to the team. We've all got an incredible passion, love and respect for each other's work!"" WHAT WE NEED & WHAT YOU GETIn order to bring CAN'T TAKE MY (EYES) OFF OF YOU to the Fringe this year, we need your help. To keep the lights on and get the word out about the show, we need to raise $950! Below is a breakdown of all of our expenses and an outline of exactly where your money will go:
Theatre Rental and Insurance: $500
Registration: $250
Postcards / Posters / Publicity: $150
Props and Costumes: $50
We want to thank you for your donation and give something back! For all of our great perks, please take a look on  the right! THE IMPACTHere's why we feel that this show is important and how your contribution will make a difference:
We believe that the Theatre is the best way to provoke thought, to inspire change, and to give a voice to the people.
Fermented Apples was created to serve as a platform for asking and addressing uncomfortable, yet essential questions and topics through new works in the Theatre. CAN'T TAKE MY EYES OFF OF YOU is universal to people of all ages. It is a piece that weighs on the importance of staying true to who you are no matter what your circumstances whether with a loved one, with a boss, or even with a friend! 
Last year we raised $1360 for STRANDED and it was a huge success! Because of the subject matter of STRANDED, How Sexual Abuse Affects Mental Health, we were able to give a voice to the victims of Sexual Abuse and make a mark that raised awareness of this Silent, yet ever present epidemic. 
OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELPWe know that money is tight, so if a monetary contribution is not realistic for you at this time, that's OK! Here are some other fun ways that you can help us out:
Come see the show! 
Tell your friends about it, Blog about it, Tweet about it!
Leave us a review after seeing the show to let us know what you thought!
Ask us for some Postcards and give them to everyone you know...maybe even a stranger or two!

Here's what we'll use your money for:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------porta potties - $238sound permit - $22PA - $30Keg - $106Food/Drink - $100Ice - $20 (thanks so much to the people who donated ice last time!)Decorations - $50Total Needed - $566------------------------------------------------------------------------------------In addition to these things, we've spent LITERALLY THOUSANDS of dollars buying and transporting something VERY SECRET AND SPECIAL for your PARTY-WRESTLING ENTERTAINMENT (HINT: ITS A REAL A$$ WRE$TLING RING) so any donations ABOVE THIS AMOUNT will help us recoup our devastating but WORTHY losses. Risks & Challenges Challenges:We're getting closer to making PWR self-sustaining but we still need help overcoming a few financial hurdles.  We've begun printing awesome merchandise but in order to keep our events FREE we still need the PWR Multiverse to give us the $$$HIGHFIVE$$$ so that we can achieve COMPLETE, MAXIMUM EVIL.Risks:The only risk is our lives (which is fine... whatever). Other Ways You Can Help If you don't want to donate money you can help us by getting the word out about this campaign and/or just word out about PWR and our upcoming event, Wrestleslam.  In addition to the keg, PWR has coolers and ice available for people to bring their OWN beers, and if you want to bring some extras for other party-people, hey... we won't stop you.Here is the facebook event page:https://www.facebook.com/events/759764607448160/",0.0,0,"22 Campaigns

<p><b><i>The story:</i> </b> Eleven years ago, visionary and founder of the MT Space (Multicultural Theatre Space), Majdi Bou-Matar, dreamed of a dynamic week of culturally diverse physical theatre; a platform for artists of all backgrounds to showcase their work and dialogue with audiences and each other.

<div><b>Funding</b></div>
<div>The amount of funding I am aiming to raise is $5,000. As evidence from the past few months of 2015, I have spent $1,250 out of my pocket in preparing for and in booking events. The breakdown of the company's spending, so far, is as follows: $600.00 on performance fees, $215.00 on application fees, $345.00 on rehearsal space and $96.00 on costumes. Unfortunately, paying my dancers was not included in this spent amount. I have 8-10 dancers performing per show, and as of this summer, Mook has 7 confirmed shows we are participating in, and likely more. If we do not get the full funding we need to strive towards company sustainability, the amount will continue being spent on logistical endeavors, such as fees and rehearsal space, and less on promoting and supporting the artistry of the dancers that perform my work. They are incredibly committed and brilliant and deserve to receive compensation for their ability and willingness to dance with Mook Dance Company.</div>

<div><b>Why Mook Matters</b></div>
<div>Dance is oftentimes difficult to understand because of its dependent use of metaphor and evocation of an idea without an obvious subject matter or purpose. Yet, what Mook Dance Company aims to accomplish is bridging the gap between metaphor and reality for dancers and non-dancers alike. It is my goal as a choreographer to utilize my voice and tell my story. But if I aim to share with an audience, I feel it is important that my work is comprehensible to understand. This is why my company's repertoire consists of real, palpable, and personal instances and elaborates on those ideas with movement that is both ethereal and literal. My choice to use authentic, natural movement alongside ornamented contemporary movement adds a criteria of relatability and human recognition, while still remaining evocative. I want to combine daily human perceptions with contemporary movement to narrate my own experiences.</div>
</div><div>
<ul> </ul>
<div>Despite discrepancies and drawbacks, I know that I am meant to create a company and share my voice in an artistically prominent sense. I know that I will have to continue paying out of pocket for some of the company's spendings, but will continue doing so. I want to exude prominence, respect, and a sense of acknowledgement for my insight, and I am willing to overcome these hardships in being an artist, dancer, and choreographer. With this donation money, I want to begin the path of collaborating with fellow artists in my company that can contribute artistically: photographers, graphic artists, business model brains, grant writers, musicians. Anyone that can advocate and rise my work to its highest self, while supporting them in an equally compassionate way, is a valuable relationship I hope to sustain<span style="""">.

Amidst outside influence which parts of us remain the same? What clings to us despite our desire to move forward? How can past decisions influence present actions, and what old habits lie just beneath a clean surface? Witness the composition and decomposition of movement, playing with the mind's inner workings, manifested in the PhysiKal Body. </p>

</div></div>","PhysiKal Bodies: Who Are We? 
We are a group of current students, recent college graduates, and committed artists. Our goal is to share what's important to us; dance and its ability to communicate, with as many people as we can. ""Remnants"" is our second company production, and we've stepped it up for this year's audience, bringing our show to the 2015 Philadelphia Fringe Festival, with 4 new works, and more energy than ever! Help make this show our best!!
Show Description:
PhysiKal Bodies is proud to present ""Remnants,"" a dance performance exploring the complex interactions between thoughts and emotions, and their tendancies to become jumbled up, lost, imagined, and reformed. Amidst outside influence which parts of us remain the same? What clings to us despite our desire to move forward? How can past decisions influence present actions, and what old habits lie just beneath a clean surface? Witness the composition and decomposition of movement, playing with the mind's inner workings, manifested in the PhysiKal Body.

With characters including Miss Alabama and her overbearing mother, Miss New Jersey and her personal gay, the has-been soap star host, the quintessential pageant coach-slash-stylist, and the ever so sweet pageant coordinator, everything is bound to be a hot mess. Pageant Tales and Beauty Fails brings everything from tiaras to catfights and the dreaded question & answer. WHY WE NEED YOUR HELPPageant Tales and Beauty Fails will be presented at Theater for the New City's Dream Up Festival at the end of August.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<div><u>The Program Notes:</u></div>
<p>Kitsune Circus is a group of young adults between the ages of 24 &amp; 30 who have decided that <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apEZpYnN_1g"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">the status is not quo</a>. Much of our lives we've been told that the only way to make a good living in this world is to get a college degree. So we went out and got them. Then the economy tanked and we had to reexamine our plans. When we really sat down and thought about it, we decided the current system is flawed. Big corporations own everything and working for a corporation is no fun. We want to be a part of something meaningful, impactful and enjoyable for us and those around us. We want to make our living doing things we feel passionate about and the best way to do it is to start your own business, so we are! </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>So, the breakdown. </p>
<p><u>Who:</u> Joan, Lauren, Jeff, Diana, Vinny and Laura. We're a mix of advanced and beginner circus performers hoping to make a living doing what we love and bringing it to you. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><u>What:</u> Kitsune Circus. A brand new company designed to make circus arts and entertainment fun, affordable and accessible to everyone. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><u>Where:</u> Our home base is in Long Island, NY. We hope to tour throughout the north east this summer and spread further and further as we get more and more recognition. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><u>When:</u> The kickstarter will run for 65 days. Then we'll purchase our equipment, train over the winter and start up with an epic Launch Party in March of 2012. In the summer we plan to both private gigs, booked through our website and public performances at renaissance faires and fringe festivals throughout the northeast!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><u>How:</u> We use the funds you send us to purchase equipment &amp; other necessary start up costs, then with the leadership of our senior members, we whip ourselves into shape for the Launch Party in March and the subsequent tour in the summer!</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div><u>The Mission a.k.a. Save the Circus, Save the World:</u></div>
<div>It seems like these days everyone you meet is struggling with something. They're overworked, underpaid and super-stressed all the time. At Kitsune Circus we believe that one of the most important things in life is enjoying it! If you can't relax and have a good time every so often, it makes all the difficult things that we have to do in a day seem that much worse. What's more, we truly believe that <a href=""http://women.webmd.com/guide/give-your-body-boost-with-laughter"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">laughter is the best medicine</a>. Laughter and excitement help to battle stress which, in high levels, can lead to high blood pressure, headaches, upset stomach, trouble sleeping, problems with your immune system, and possible mental health and chronic disease problems. We can keep the world healthy and happy by giving everyone a chance to enjoy and participate in circus arts, a fun and unique experience, both for the audience and the performers. When people can relax and have a good time in a safe environment, it enables them to get inspired, take risks, build confidences and do things they never thought they were capable of. We want to bring these qualities to you. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>In order to deliver our special brand of ""medicine"" though, we need your help. Without you we're just a struggling start-up, like everyone else. With you, we're a charming, exciting and unique new performance group with the ability to change the world, one audience at a time.  </div>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><u>The Pre-Show Meeting:</u> </p>
<p>Alright people, here's where we get down to the nitty gritty. The money we're trying to raise is going to pay for 3 major categories of items. The first category is aerial and safety equipment. This includes our portable rig, an aerial hoop with rigging, a massive crash pad for safety during practice and rehearsal as well as a ground gymnastics pad for practicing and performing partner acrobatics. This stuff is mostly first priority because it will enable us to practice more safely and bring you longer, better and more exciting shows. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The second category is individual equipment. This includes stuff like bullwhips, fire fans, an LED staff and a handful of other stuff. Though all the equipment will be owned by the company it's primarily used by one performer at a time. This stuff will allows us to practice on our own time and make our shows more comprehensive, professional and flexible by allowing us to adapt our show to different conditions (e.g. fire, LED, daytime, etc). This stuff is second priority because we want to ensure we have a professional, beautiful and exciting look when we come to you to perform.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The third category is non-performance equipment/services. This includes a Graphic Designer fee, a portable amp and a DSLR camera (+ necessary accessories). We've added this category to our budget to ensure that we can perform in any space with extreme flexibility and little to no dependence on outside circumstance. The graphic designer will work with us to develop a beautiful website, brand identity and marketing campaign.The camera will help us document our performances and rehearsals with photos and video so you can always see what's going on. This stuff is our third priority because it will help us achieve the highly polished and professional look of a great circus company while also enabling us to stay connected with you, our fans. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>In the unfortunate event that we don't reach full funding, we'll start with Category 1 and work our way through to the bottom priorities until we run out of funding. If you'd like to see a more detailed account of what we're planning to do with the money and how things are prioritized, feel free to email us for a pdf of our budget! We'd be happy to show you. </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p><u>Be a Barker!</u></p>
<p>In the circus, a barker is not an overactive pooch. Rather, it's the person that uses their charm and boisterous personality to call people to the tent and let them know what's going on! If you commit to being a Barker for Kitsune Circus you can get a free upgrade from your donation level (even if that level is 0$!) to the next! All you have to do is use your social network to get us noticed. Get five people to like us on Facebook or follow us on Twitter and you can get a 1 free upgrade. If you get at least 2 people to donate 10$ or more, you can get another free upgrade! You can get both of these upgrades and they can stack, but the limit is 3 upgrades of any combination. For example: If you get ten friends to like/follow us and 2 donors, you can get 3 upgrades, but if you get ten friends and 4 donors, you still only get 3 upgrades - otherwise we'd spend all our money sending you gifts, and while awesome, it'd kind of defeat the point. Perks above the 1000$ level are not eligible for upgrades. </p>

<p>Since it was published in 1972, George V. Higgins' <em>The Friends of Eddie Coyle</em> has set the bar by which all badass Boston crime stories are measured.  Written by a master of dialogue and a federal prosecutor, the dialogue sounds as if it was pulled from wiretaps and the story is among the most realistic, unforgiving, portrayals of criminals ever written.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We're launching a world premirre of the first stage adaptation of <em>The Friends of Eddie Coyle</em>, bringing the dialogue, the characters, and perhaps the most realistic depiction of crime's underbelly to the stage.  We open at Oberon, Harvard Square, in December -- and we're seeking funds to ensure tickets remain affordable so we can tell this one of a kind story in a new way, to a new audience.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Eddie Coyle is a couple of weeks away from a jail sentence for trucking stolen booze, and making some money supplying guns to a crew of bank robbers.  He's trying to stay alive and out of jail among his friends: robbers, bartenders, cops, rats, and hitmen.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Elmore Leonard called it the best crime novel ever written.  Writers from David Mamet to Quentin Tarantino learned from the use of dialogue.  And no one has captured the character, the humor, and the poetry of the Boston dialect as well, before or since. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Performed live, in a nightclub style theater, the story can unfold all around the audience.  A story of lies and betrayal at the lowest rungs of the crimnal underworld.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>No fake accents -- Local talent</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We're casting locally grown, experienced actors to bring this story to life and be true to the time and place where it's set:  greater Boston, winter of 1969-70.  The play swirls around from neighborhood bars, to supermarket parking lots, to a trailer park in Orange, to banks, to the Boston Garden to watch Bobby Orr play.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>And this is why we're asking for help.  To bring the story to life properly, it takes a crew of eleven actors, lighting designers, sound techs, costume designers, and set designers to do justice to the story.  All of these people will be working diligently to produce a quality show, and bring The Friends of Eddie Coyle to new audiences.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>All funds raised support these professionals and produce a quality and affordable show for greater Boston.<br/></p>
<h3>December 8 - Jan. 15</h3>
<p>We will run for 11 performances at Oberon, Harvard Square -- and ticket prices will largely be determined by the success of our fundraising.  All contributors -- at any amount - will be listed in the program as A Friend of Eddie Coyle and we make no bones about it:  You helped make the show possible.  </p>

<p>Lily's new boyfriend is funny, charming, more than a little goofy and...the devil. No, really, Satan. Lucifer. The font of all evil. But he's not really that bad. Or is he? Does he have a diabolical plan for Lily's soul? Or does he just want to win her heart? As she falls deeper and deeper, and her friends get more and more worried about her heart and her immortal soul, Lily has to face her own inner demons...and maybe a few outer ones, too.</p>

3 Plays, 2 Weekends, 1 Act
May 31 - June 9, 2013
The Unknown Artists are proud to present our very first FESTIVAL OF ONE ACTS: The 321 Festival (three plays, two weekends, one act).  This production features actors, playwrights, and crew made up of members from Play Club West, our group which meets weekly in North Hollywood for readings of new and established works. Two of our one acts, ""Devour"" and ""Snakeskin Suit"" are original works, developed through Play Club West's NEW WORKS SERIES, and the final slot is filled with the hilarious comedy ""Matt and Ben,"" by Mindy Kaling and Brenda Withers.
After the recent success of our production of the original musical, Right Together, Left Together, we know how instrumental our supporters are to achieving the highest production level possible.
That being said, as we approach opening night we need your help! All donations will go directly to necessities such as theater rental and insurance, promotional materials, production rights, and rehearsal space. 
Read about each of the three shows below! If you are unable to donate, you can help by sharing our campaign via Facebook, Twitter, etc. You can also show your support in person by seeing any or all of the performances! You can buy tickets HERE.
SNAKESKIN SUIT, an original play by J. Holtham
Directed by Joshua Hsu
Sound Design by D.A. Strawder
Stage Managed by Travis James Riner
Starring Jeni Incontro, Oscar Gubelman, Tiffany Brain, and Ben Montague
Lily's new boyfriend is funny, charming, more than a little goofy and...the devil. No, really, Satan. Lucifer. The font of all evil. But he's not really that bad. Or is he? Does he have a diabolical plan for Lily's soul? Or does he just want to win her heart? As she falls deeper and deeper, and her friends get more and more worried about her heart and her immortal soul, Lily has to face her own inner demons...and maybe a few outer ones, too.
DEVOUR, an original play by Chelsea Marcantel
Directed by Emily Clark
Stage Managed by Aielo Jimenez
Starring Meghan Allison, Anna Bowen, Cody Clark, Andy Kenarecki, Kate Purnell, Caitlin Reilly, and Travis James Riner

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Bernard Bey. To be honest and frank the concept and idea for this project is based on my own life experiences growing up. I only want to afford some of the youth in our urban communities who desperately need and deserve it an opportunity to become successful at something we both love, performing arts. When I look back at my life and relive all my own struggles I have this deep longing, thinking to myself if I only had an opportunity to do it all over, but alas, once reality  sets in, as it always does, I realize what is done can never be undone.  Life only moves forward, what I can do is provide direction for youth who endure similar situations. As beneficial as it is for the youth, it will be equally beneficial for myself and all who are engaged within this project. I feel its and opportunity for us to shine a light into the world for people to notice and to help instill a concrete perception of the importance of education saving and finance to these young adults who truly need it. How can a young adult make good decisions without knowing available options or direction from a positive role model on how to execute them? What I wish I had I want to give to someone else and this is my motivation.  With the combined efforts of myself, Dianna and Moni we have committed ourselves to this project and we move forward with passion and conviction to make this event a reality. With your support we shall be victorious.</p>

<h3> We Need Your Help</h3>
<p>We need $100,000 dollars in financing to pay for performance space at York Community College, Stage staff, sets, and props.targeted social media marketing, a promotional street team the production of a compilation album as well as other promotional and marketing materials such as T- Shirts, buttons, etc. In a nut shell we need at least 2000 people to contribute $50 dollars to our campaign. The twelve youth selected to participate in the project will receive four weeks of mentoring with and emphasis on education, financial literacy, the incentives of vocations and business and success stories. During and two months following the mentoring aspect of the project, the youth will be working on the production of the theatrical event ""Reaching Your Full Potential"" This will continue every Saturday from 11am until 7pm at one of the performing arts colleges in NYC.</p>
<p>The project director Diana Rocker will conduct the project with the performance coordinator Jade E. Griffith concerning Choreograph of all numbers within the event, she will also cover hair and make up for the production. After the production is complete and ready to be performed. We will also have completed the audio production of the compilation album ""Reaching Your Full Potential"" which will be handled by Ramona Delgado. We will secure merchandise to be sold at the theatrical event. Once this whole process is complete we will conduct a tour to be conducted in select cities and states. 3 showcases per city starting with NYC. 20% of all proceeds will be given to the youth to use towards a college education, vocation, or expenses pertaining to obtaining the same or a suitable business endeavor.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I want to stress the fact that our contributors are helping to provide the youth in our local urban communities an opportunity to change their lives. More than a fair amount of the youth in our communities lack direction and prove to be irresponsible and unfocused about what career path they should take to become a resposnsible  successful adult. Most do not know basic financial concepts such as the importance of saving, how to open a checking or savings account for themselves at a financial institution. On more than one occassion I have witnessed the fact that they don't understand credit or it's neccessity in establishing a foundation for yourself as a young adult to obtain  an appartment, an automobile, in the future a home or financing for a business etc. As we conduct this project we will mentor the youth on these core principals and the importance of education. Ultimately this foundation will give the youth the tools they need to become responsible successful adults. </p>
