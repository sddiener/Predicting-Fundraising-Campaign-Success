I've had wonderful experiences, but always as a 'hired gun,' and never my own project.</p><p>I've loved dance my whole life but have never combined it with anything I've done musically.</p><p>I've always loved the theatrical and wanted to perform live and create videos combining elements of costume and makeup, fantasy and visual art.</p><p>My recent experience with pole dancing, burlesque, and belly dancing has inspired me to put all of my passions together into something that I haven't seen done before and would be a thrilling challenge both creatively and personally.</p><p> </p><h2>My Story</h2><p>I play violin, harp, piano, viola, guitar, and bass- classically trained from age 3.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478399267/yp3xdz3m4pdya4vlsh9h.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>I have played hundreds of projects professionally and expanded into jazz, blues, Irish fiddle, Piazzolla, gypsy and tango violin, pop, rock, and metal, bluegrass, and country.</p><p><i>(I may or may not be able to melt your face off shredding with distortion effects)</i></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478559070/lksn9bksoywvramsiudd.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Because of the 'Flying V' shape of my electric violin, (no way to rest on your shoulder and grip under your chin) it has an attachment system that allows full mobility of the left arm.

<li>The first album of harp and violin favorites and duets (playing both harp and violin tracks) is already in the works (see Go Fund Me campaign for further detail)</li>
<li>I am singing my favorite jazz ballads for a vocal album with supporting tracks I play myself on harp, violin, piano, guitar, and bass. (not to be a gimmick, I'm just cheap labor) including 'My Funny Valentine,' 'Tenderly,' 'Willow Weep For Me,' 'Cry Me A River,' 'Gentle Rain,' 'Misty,' 'Round Midnight,' 'In A Sentimental Mood.'</li>
<li>I am also working on multi-track covers of songs including 'Sweet Child O Mine,' 'Barracuda,' 'Black Velvet,' 'Blister in the Sun,' 'Thunderstruck,' and 'Istanbul,' 'Cherry Pie,' 'Suicide Blonde,' 'Call Me.'</li>
<li>I would like to do an all-Debussy album featuring the string quartet, my own arrangement of Clair de Lune, and the vocal art song 'Beau Soir.'</li>
<li>I would like to do an album of 40's big band and jazz standards including 'But Not For Me,' Girl From Ipanema,' 'I Got Rhythm,' 'Begin the Beguine,' 'My Heart Belongs to Daddy' </li>
</ul><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478558574/rvrnpe5pdacwqoipoqsh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3>Create videos for songs from each album that incorporate dance and visual expression of what the music means to me</h3><ul>
<li>Ballet pole routine 'en pointe' to the beautiful and graceful 'Ave Maria' (original Bach on harp with Gounod's melody on violin)</li>
<li>Melancholy personal reflection playing Massenet's Meditation while wading into the sea, either to be engulfed by it or find peace. (or both...)</li>
<li>Argentine tango to 'Cry Me a River' (the jazz standard, not the pop song)</li>
<li>Contemporary dance and aerial routine to 'My Funny Valentine'</li>
<li>Burlesque pole routine to 'Harlem Nocturne' (look it up, it's sultry like something out of 'Sin City)</li>
<li>Cha Cha or Samba routine to 'Girl From Ipanema' (I sing it in Portugese, Bossa Nova style, not the Sinatra swing or style that's commonly thought of as elevator music)</li>
<li>Rhumba routine to 'Gentle Rain' (another latin flavored Bossa Nova)</li>
<li>Belly Dance routine to Shakira's 'Ojos Asi'</li>
<li>Pole routines to pop and metal covers (any number depending on royalty costs)</li>
</ul><h3>Create live performances</h3><p>I would build up in scale with increased experience and funding, anywhere from street performing to eventually large venue shows.</p><p>I have been traveling and street performing to experiment with different venues and styles, even playing my pedal harp on Fremont Street in Las Vegas. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479126661/x4copoji0zrrsmte5xc5.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>I have also had fun setting up an amp with the electric violin and playing 'karaoke roulette' with passers-by who can connect their phone to my Bluetooth speaker and dare me to improvise along with any song of their choosing. </p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""> </p><p>I want to set up a mic, a guitar, and a bass and do this with a full band or use a karaoke system and allow anyone in the crowd who sings or plays to jump up and join in.</p><p>I could add pole routines with a portable stage pole like this one:</p><p><a href=""http://xpoleus.com/product/x-stage-lite-45mm-chrome/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://xpoleus.com/product/x-stage-lite-45mm-ch...</a></p><p>Eventually I would hope to do full stage shows with a cast of musicians, dancers, and aerialists.</p><p> </p><h2>Why Indiegogo:</h2><h3>1- I want to share this journey with others.</h3><p>Any journey is better when you can celebrate milestones with those who want you to succeed, believe in the big dreams and creative drive that keeps you going in moments of discouragement, and provide inspiration with campaigns and journeys of their own.</p><h3>2- I believe this is possible without the traditional structure of manager/agent/record label</h3><p>I've watched the music industry evolve for the last several years working a corporate job (due to injury, couldn't play full time- long story I'll tell later) while still playing freelance enough to be around and watch the possibilities open up, see how others were forging careers in new ways. </p><p>I gained invaluable experience in business and management, technology, accounting, tax and contract law, and studied up on entertainment law and copyrights on my own, audio recording, marketing, production and promotion, and any other skill I thought would help me venture into my own music endeavors. </p><p><i>(That's not my Aston Martin- this is just to look like someone who's savvy in business)</i></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479081108/iwtzj12llmvjomisrtsb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3>3- I can't do this on my own. </h3><p>I don't think it's necessary to turn over creative control, but I certainly can't do everything myself, especially where it involves talents and abilities I don't have.</p><p> </p><h2><i>Why Now?</i></h2><h3>1- If I wait until I have a finished product to show people or involve anyone else, I will never get there. </h3><p>I could lock myself in a studio for a year to trainand work to have more to show you, but I think I'd be so starved for connection and collaboration my soul would shrivel. </p><ul></ul><h3>2- I Need to commit and define my intentions --for myself.</h3><p>Sometimes it helps to put something into words and officially put it into the universe as a way of making it real for yourself.</p><p><i>(I'll post a link to my blog about the personal journey of realizing I was holding back each time I tried to put my ideas into words.)</i></p><p><strong>It's time for me to face my fears, define what I want, put it out there, and commit myself.</strong></p><p> </p><h2>What I'm Raising Funds For:</h2><p>Choreography, videography, administrative and marketing costs, live show production, dancers and musicians, crew, and travel costs. </p><p>I am operating on a shoestring budget right now as I travel, experiment, and get my production company set up. I'm living in my car, which I consider an adventure (read: don't feel sorry for me, I actually love it) but eventually could use a bigger vehicle so all my instruments could come with me, and eventually other people.</p><p>This really is my fantasy lifestyle (thus the name of the campaign) to travel constantly and explore the world while doing everything that I love. Eventually I would love to have a setup that would allow near-constant travel while creating new music and video along the way. (I will post more detail on this later)</p><p>For now, I mainly need my own time free to devote as I set up the administrative side, record the music, and plan the initial videos and live shows.</p><p>(I had significant savings going into the travel lifestyle but has depleted as my explorations evolved my idea of what I wanted to do)</p><p>I am financing my first album separately (<a href=""https://www.gofundme.com/2u377xo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.gofundme.com/2u377xo</a>) and then will need a choreographer and dance partner plus videography for the first video.</p><p> </p><h2>What I'm Offering Backers:</h2><ul>
<li>Advance sales of the album and singles</li>
<li>Advance screenings of videos</li>
<li>'Panel' experiences- a chance to go into the studio with me, see the process and provide feedback via private Periscope channel. </li>

<li>Private performances, workshops, and bachelorette party nights out including pole class!</li>

<li>A Las Vegas New Year's party like no other, including the full weekend experience including VIP access to all performances and luxury accommodations.</li>
</ul><p><i>I figure I'm better off staying away from physical items that would need to be shipped, but if there are specific perks you would like to see, let me know, I'm open to suggestion.</i></p><h2>Why This Is Important To Me:</h2><p>My relationship with both music and dance have gotten somewhat fragmented. In order to make a living as a freelance musician, you don't pick the project or style of music, it's not a creative expression of YOU. I never want to argue with people who say 'Oh how awesome that you get to do what you love for a living,' and yet what pays money isn't necessarily the same as what I love about music. </p><p>On the other hand, I have loved dance my whole life but never been good enough to dance professionally. I enjoy it with the pure love of a fan, which has its own joy, and yet always the longing to be able to do the awe-inspiring things you see professionals doing. </p><p>I always figured I would venture into my own music projects as a way of reclaiming creativity and expression, and once I built enough of a career, I could 'get away with' doing videos involving some dance, and people would work with me because I would be the paying client. I didn't feel I could justify saying I wanted to do dance as a thing that I love to do.</p><p>I realize how sad I would be if I wanted to dance and was told I just plain can't if I'm not good enough. That humbles me from looking down on anyone who wants to play music because they love it, even if they weren't trained to the skill level as was expected of me. </p><p>Music, dance, and all art should be something that speaks to our souls and expresses what words cannot. No one should be excluded. I've loved watching the dance shows that are more about the journey than showcasing pure skill. Not to say that we shouldn't strive for higher skill levels and refine crafts, but just so as to better express what the soul wants to use art to express, not as a ranking or qualification system.</p><p>I want to face my own fears about feeling that I can be a dancer even if I'm not the best dancer, show others that they can too, and use my musical experience to build something that welcomes and includes all instead of judging, intimidating, or excluding anyone.</p><h2>Why I Believe This Has Value:</h2><p>Pole dancing in particular has had a profound impact on me. Aside from fears of not being good enough, I've had the struggle with body image issues that is a female's birthright in our society.</p><p>Pole class was the most accepting, supportive environment I've ever experienced. The ballet style class was beautiful and expressive, and it was always emphasized that we should do each step in a way that felt right, make it our own. </p><p>I struggled with tricks and jumps due to arm injury (story for another day) but once I took the pole-esque (burlesque style) class, I had found 'my thing' and immediately bought my own pole.</p><p>The music was sultry, the routines were sassy, and the lights were turned low. But there was nothing trashy about it, never for anyone else or about being an object. The students dressed in anything from sweats to full burlesque outfits, and all shapes, sizes, ages, and body types were represented and accepted equally. </p><p>I could suddenly feel legitimate (not just vain) in dressing in something sexy and dancing in my living room-- I was practicing my routine!! But then I wondered why I should need an excuse or feel vain for wanting to feel sexy. That seemed to imply that my sensuality and sexuality only existed for men. </p><p>I've realized it's the opposite of what one might think about pole dancing- and I want to show women that there is something so powerful about connecting with your own sensuality - not for anyone but yourself. </p><h3>The ultimate in putting everything together is to feel like it would do some good in the world</h3><p>If I can build bridges and defy limitations of style in music, that would be fulfilling on its own. If I can inspire others in facing fears and body image issues, that is worth the vulnerability of stretching myself beyond my comfort zone. But it would be ultimately fulfilling if I can also show women, girls, and even men an expression of sensuality that is beautiful, creative, and empowering for its own sake and not for anyone else's benefit or approval. </p><h3>I'm excited to be part of this community of creatives and innovators, and to share your journeys as well as my own. </h3><p>You can scroll down for more of my story, musical examples, and inspirations behind my ideas.</p><p><i>I'll also be blogging on my website musicadventuregirl.com.</i></p><p><strong>Cheers to the journey!!</strong></p><p> </p><p>* Apologies to PayPal users, as I cannot accept PayPal on this platform.

But I wasn't sure what type of band I'd want to be in, which style if I had to pick one, or whether I should do my own thing. </p><h3>I started formulating ideas....</h3><p>I had to stop playing full time due to an injury several years ago, so have been working at a corporate job, which has been valuable in learning business and management. I've watched the music industry evolve and I've taken notes while studying up on technology, accounting, tax and entertainment law.</p><p>I acquired more instruments and 'toys,' tinkered with audio, effects systems, looper pedals and ways of playing along to tracks I'd recorded on a different instrument. </p><p>I've been going to blues nights and jazz jams, playing with various bands and experimenting with different styles.</p><h3>I've always wanted to incorporate dance and do videos.</h3><p>I always figured I would need to build a music career and then be able to incorporate some dance as part of it. At most, I hoped to work with great dancers if I could be the paying client hiring them to choreograph a video. Or maybe convince the pro dancers to join me if I ever got invited to perform as a musical guest on 'Dancing With The Stars.'</p><h3>I recently left my 'day job' to venture into my own thing.</h3><p>I've been traveling and street performing, finding the local bars where musicians gather and play in any city. I've experimented with different styles and collaborations, and I've had a great time doing all of this. </p><p>Everyone told me I needed to solidify my style and pick a 'niche' in order to be successful, but I could never narrow down one style I loved most or that represented all sides of me. I was more interested in learning MORE styles, meeting street performers and learning from them, going to the local jam joint in each city rather than put on a performance showcasing what I did.</p><p>But it's only so fun if I'm trying to do everything myself. For learning purposes or cheap labor, it's fine, but now I really want to be able to collaborate and involve other musicians. I just won't accept the concept of having to be limited to one style.</p><p>And as much as I love the adventure of living in my car and being a traveling free spirit, it's crowded in my car with all my instruments and difficult to train with nowhere to put them all, let alone set up my pole.</p><p>As I've had to rethink my plan as funds ran low and I was moving farther from a place where I could launch something that would pay the bills, I've started peeling back additional layers and realized that I wouldn't care about any project if it only represented a small fraction of me. I decided I'd rather go back to a day job than compromise in order to play into what was more sure to 'catch on,' and become financially successful. </p><p>The more I peeled back these layers, I found fears surrounding dance and realized that it would be terrifying to go for my ultimate dream without the buffer of success, but it would be the only way it would be authentic enough.</p><p>And so here I am, looking for a network of people who support rather than discourage big dreams.</p><p> </p><p> </p><h3>My Inspirations:</h3><p>I would love to do a tango like this playing violin:</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/gTEuIXz7MqE?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><p> </p><p><i>I would love to do the violin/harp duet to a modern pole routine like this one:</i></p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/khvcCpoFszM?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><h3> </h3><p>This inspired me to sign up for pole classes:</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/FuHYZ1Sb2zE?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><p> </p><p>This is my pole-esque teacher, Angela Nelson- current national champion in Pole Sport, and incredible vixen! </p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/L1rlvNLqjpI?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><p> </p><p>This is my belly dance (and pole) teacher, Michelle Sorensen- her physique, movement, and control are endlessly mesmerizing and awe-inspiring!</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/-ERpjsq54ck?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><div> </div><div> </div><div>

</div><div> </div><div>
<h2>
<u>Immediate Plan &amp; What I Need</u>:</h2>
<p>I don't need all that much funding to start, and I'm planning fun events along the way. Hopefully once it's off the ground, each venture will finance the next. </p>
<p><strong>I mainly need 4 things right now:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>My own time</strong> to devote to this without working full time to pay bills, especially with administrative demands and building a social media network </li>
<li>
<strong>Administrative costs- </strong>minimal, a few hundred to register my production company and pay for a business license, accounting apps, marketing materials</li>
<li>
<strong>Studio space to train and rehearse</strong>- I need enough studio for both dance rehearsals and and all my instruments.</li>

</div></div>","I am a musician, singer, and dancer. I want to incorporate dance, pole, and aerial with live music and singing to create something unique that I haven't seen done before, and that expresses who I am and everything I love.I've worked as a professional freelance musician for years. I've had wonderful experiences, but always as a 'hired gun,' and never my own project.I've loved dance my whole life but have never combined it with anything I've done musically.I've always loved the theatrical and wanted to perform live and create videos combining elements of costume and makeup, fantasy and visual art.My recent experience with pole dancing, burlesque, and belly dancing has inspired me to put all of my passions together into something that I haven't seen done before and would be a thrilling challenge both creatively and personally. My StoryI play violin, harp, piano, viola, guitar, and bass- classically trained from age 3.I have played hundreds of projects professionally and expanded into jazz, blues, Irish fiddle, Piazzolla, gypsy and tango violin, pop, rock, and metal, bluegrass, and country.(I may or may not be able to melt your face off shredding with distortion effects)Because of the 'Flying V' shape of my electric violin, (no way to rest on your shoulder and grip under your chin) it has an attachment system that allows full mobility of the left arm. So I can occasionally release my left hand and could perform dance or pole routines, especially with the assistance of a partner. What I Plan To DoCreate music utilizing all the elements I've developed and spans all the styles I love.
The first album of harp and violin favorites and duets (playing both harp and violin tracks) is already in the works (see Go Fund Me campaign for further detail)
I am singing my favorite jazz ballads for a vocal album with supporting tracks I play myself on harp, violin, piano, guitar, and bass. (not to be a gimmick, I'm just cheap labor) including 'My Funny Valentine,' 'Tenderly,' 'Willow Weep For Me,' 'Cry Me A River,' 'Gentle Rain,' 'Misty,' 'Round Midnight,' 'In A Sentimental Mood.'
I am also working on multi-track covers of songs including 'Sweet Child O Mine,' 'Barracuda,' 'Black Velvet,' 'Blister in the Sun,' 'Thunderstruck,' and 'Istanbul,' 'Cherry Pie,' 'Suicide Blonde,' 'Call Me.'
I would like to do an all-Debussy album featuring the string quartet, my own arrangement of Clair de Lune, and the vocal art song 'Beau Soir.'
I would like to do an album of 40's big band and jazz standards including 'But Not For Me,' Girl From Ipanema,' 'I Got Rhythm,' 'Begin the Beguine,' 'My Heart Belongs to Daddy' 
 Create videos for songs from each album that incorporate dance and visual expression of what the music means to me
Ballet pole routine 'en pointe' to the beautiful and graceful 'Ave Maria' (original Bach on harp with Gounod's melody on violin)
Melancholy personal reflection playing Massenet's Meditation while wading into the sea, either to be engulfed by it or find peace. (or both...)
Argentine tango to 'Cry Me a River' (the jazz standard, not the pop song)
Contemporary dance and aerial routine to 'My Funny Valentine'
Burlesque pole routine to 'Harlem Nocturne' (look it up, it's sultry like something out of 'Sin City)
Cha Cha or Samba routine to 'Girl From Ipanema' (I sing it in Portugese, Bossa Nova style, not the Sinatra swing or style that's commonly thought of as elevator music)
Rhumba routine to 'Gentle Rain' (another latin flavored Bossa Nova)
Belly Dance routine to Shakira's 'Ojos Asi'
Pole routines to pop and metal covers (any number depending on royalty costs)
Create live performancesI would build up in scale with increased experience and funding, anywhere from street performing to eventually large venue shows.I have been traveling and street performing to experiment with different venues and styles, even playing my pedal harp on Fremont Street in Las Vegas. I have also had fun setting up an amp with the electric violin and playing 'karaoke roulette' with passers-by who can connect their phone to my Bluetooth speaker and dare me to improvise along with any song of their choosing.  I want to set up a mic, a guitar, and a bass and do this with a full band or use a karaoke system and allow anyone in the crowd who sings or plays to jump up and join in.I could add pole routines with a portable stage pole like this one:http://xpoleus.com/product/x-stage-lite-45mm-ch...Eventually I would hope to do full stage shows with a cast of musicians, dancers, and aerialists. Why Indiegogo:1- I want to share this journey with others.Any journey is better when you can celebrate milestones with those who want you to succeed, believe in the big dreams and creative drive that keeps you going in moments of discouragement, and provide inspiration with campaigns and journeys of their own.2- I believe this is possible without the traditional structure of manager/agent/record labelI've watched the music industry evolve for the last several years working a corporate job (due to injury, couldn't play full time- long story I'll tell later) while still playing freelance enough to be around and watch the possibilities open up, see how others were forging careers in new ways. I gained invaluable experience in business and management, technology, accounting, tax and contract law, and studied up on entertainment law and copyrights on my own, audio recording, marketing, production and promotion, and any other skill I thought would help me venture into my own music endeavors. (That's not my Aston Martin- this is just to look like someone who's savvy in business)3- I can't do this on my own. I don't think it's necessary to turn over creative control, but I certainly can't do everything myself, especially where it involves talents and abilities I don't have. Why Now?1- If I wait until I have a finished product to show people or involve anyone else, I will never get there. I could lock myself in a studio for a year to trainand work to have more to show you, but I think I'd be so starved for connection and collaboration my soul would shrivel. 2- I Need to commit and define my intentions --for myself.Sometimes it helps to put something into words and officially put it into the universe as a way of making it real for yourself.(I'll post a link to my blog about the personal journey of realizing I was holding back each time I tried to put my ideas into words.)It's time for me to face my fears, define what I want, put it out there, and commit myself. What I'm Raising Funds For:Choreography, videography, administrative and marketing costs, live show production, dancers and musicians, crew, and travel costs. I am operating on a shoestring budget right now as I travel, experiment, and get my production company set up. I'm living in my car, which I consider an adventure (read: don't feel sorry for me, I actually love it) but eventually could use a bigger vehicle so all my instruments could come with me, and eventually other people.This really is my fantasy lifestyle (thus the name of the campaign) to travel constantly and explore the world while doing everything that I love. Eventually I would love to have a setup that would allow near-constant travel while creating new music and video along the way. (I will post more detail on this later)For now, I mainly need my own time free to devote as I set up the administrative side, record the music, and plan the initial videos and live shows.(I had significant savings going into the travel lifestyle but has depleted as my explorations evolved my idea of what I wanted to do)I am financing my first album separately (https://www.gofundme.com/2u377xo) and then will need a choreographer and dance partner plus videography for the first video. What I'm Offering Backers:
Advance sales of the album and singles
Advance screenings of videos
'Panel' experiences- a chance to go into the studio with me, see the process and provide feedback via private Periscope channel. 
Live performance tickets
VIP backstage experiences, meet-and-greets, and post-concert jam sessions with the band!
Private performances, workshops, and bachelorette party nights out including pole class!
Launch parties, jam sessions, and promo events in fabulous, infamous Las Vegas! 
A Las Vegas New Year's party like no other, including the full weekend experience including VIP access to all performances and luxury accommodations.
I figure I'm better off staying away from physical items that would need to be shipped, but if there are specific perks you would like to see, let me know, I'm open to suggestion.Why This Is Important To Me:My relationship with both music and dance have gotten somewhat fragmented. In order to make a living as a freelance musician, you don't pick the project or style of music, it's not a creative expression of YOU. I never want to argue with people who say 'Oh how awesome that you get to do what you love for a living,' and yet what pays money isn't necessarily the same as what I love about music. On the other hand, I have loved dance my whole life but never been good enough to dance professionally. I enjoy it with the pure love of a fan, which has its own joy, and yet always the longing to be able to do the awe-inspiring things you see professionals doing. I always figured I would venture into my own music projects as a way of reclaiming creativity and expression, and once I built enough of a career, I could 'get away with' doing videos involving some dance, and people would work with me because I would be the paying client. I didn't feel I could justify saying I wanted to do dance as a thing that I love to do.I realize how sad I would be if I wanted to dance and was told I just plain can't if I'm not good enough. That humbles me from looking down on anyone who wants to play music because they love it, even if they weren't trained to the skill level as was expected of me. Music, dance, and all art should be something that speaks to our souls and expresses what words cannot. No one should be excluded. I've loved watching the dance shows that are more about the journey than showcasing pure skill. Not to say that we shouldn't strive for higher skill levels and refine crafts, but just so as to better express what the soul wants to use art to express, not as a ranking or qualification system.I want to face my own fears about feeling that I can be a dancer even if I'm not the best dancer, show others that they can too, and use my musical experience to build something that welcomes and includes all instead of judging, intimidating, or excluding anyone.Why I Believe This Has Value:Pole dancing in particular has had a profound impact on me. Aside from fears of not being good enough, I've had the struggle with body image issues that is a female's birthright in our society.Pole class was the most accepting, supportive environment I've ever experienced. The ballet style class was beautiful and expressive, and it was always emphasized that we should do each step in a way that felt right, make it our own. I struggled with tricks and jumps due to arm injury (story for another day) but once I took the pole-esque (burlesque style) class, I had found 'my thing' and immediately bought my own pole.The music was sultry, the routines were sassy, and the lights were turned low. But there was nothing trashy about it, never for anyone else or about being an object. The students dressed in anything from sweats to full burlesque outfits, and all shapes, sizes, ages, and body types were represented and accepted equally. I could suddenly feel legitimate (not just vain) in dressing in something sexy and dancing in my living room-- I was practicing my routine!! But then I wondered why I should need an excuse or feel vain for wanting to feel sexy. That seemed to imply that my sensuality and sexuality only existed for men. I've realized it's the opposite of what one might think about pole dancing- and I want to show women that there is something so powerful about connecting with your own sensuality - not for anyone but yourself. The ultimate in putting everything together is to feel like it would do some good in the worldIf I can build bridges and defy limitations of style in music, that would be fulfilling on its own. If I can inspire others in facing fears and body image issues, that is worth the vulnerability of stretching myself beyond my comfort zone. But it would be ultimately fulfilling if I can also show women, girls, and even men an expression of sensuality that is beautiful, creative, and empowering for its own sake and not for anyone else's benefit or approval. I'm excited to be part of this community of creatives and innovators, and to share your journeys as well as my own. You can scroll down for more of my story, musical examples, and inspirations behind my ideas.I'll also be blogging on my website musicadventuregirl.com.Cheers to the journey!! * Apologies to PayPal users, as I cannot accept PayPal on this platform.

I received scholarships, studied with amazing teachers at prestigious institutions, music festivals, string quartets and chamber ensembles. I soloed with orchestras, toured and competed internationally. I've had incredible experiences playing professionally, but it was never my project.I've performed and recorded extensively as a freelancer- live shows or albums for other artists, movie soundtracks, commercials, TV shows, cartoons, news theme songs, video game music, you name it. My favorite is playing arena shows with rock stars/bands. Being on stage with that kind of energy, the lights and lasers and thousands of people cheering is incredible!I always felt restrained being 'string player #3' and having to say poisedIf they had a violinist in the band, I'd think ""maybe I should be THAT person."" But I wasn't sure what type of band I'd want to be in, which style if I had to pick one, or whether I should do my own thing. I started formulating ideas....I had to stop playing full time due to an injury several years ago, so have been working at a corporate job, which has been valuable in learning business and management. I've watched the music industry evolve and I've taken notes while studying up on technology, accounting, tax and entertainment law.I acquired more instruments and 'toys,' tinkered with audio, effects systems, looper pedals and ways of playing along to tracks I'd recorded on a different instrument. I've been going to blues nights and jazz jams, playing with various bands and experimenting with different styles.I've always wanted to incorporate dance and do videos.I always figured I would need to build a music career and then be able to incorporate some dance as part of it. At most, I hoped to work with great dancers if I could be the paying client hiring them to choreograph a video. Or maybe convince the pro dancers to join me if I ever got invited to perform as a musical guest on 'Dancing With The Stars.'I recently left my 'day job' to venture into my own thing.I've been traveling and street performing, finding the local bars where musicians gather and play in any city. I've experimented with different styles and collaborations, and I've had a great time doing all of this. Everyone told me I needed to solidify my style and pick a 'niche' in order to be successful, but I could never narrow down one style I loved most or that represented all sides of me. I was more interested in learning MORE styles, meeting street performers and learning from them, going to the local jam joint in each city rather than put on a performance showcasing what I did.But it's only so fun if I'm trying to do everything myself. For learning purposes or cheap labor, it's fine, but now I really want to be able to collaborate and involve other musicians. I just won't accept the concept of having to be limited to one style.And as much as I love the adventure of living in my car and being a traveling free spirit, it's crowded in my car with all my instruments and difficult to train with nowhere to put them all, let alone set up my pole.As I've had to rethink my plan as funds ran low and I was moving farther from a place where I could launch something that would pay the bills, I've started peeling back additional layers and realized that I wouldn't care about any project if it only represented a small fraction of me. I decided I'd rather go back to a day job than compromise in order to play into what was more sure to 'catch on,' and become financially successful. The more I peeled back these layers, I found fears surrounding dance and realized that it would be terrifying to go for my ultimate dream without the buffer of success, but it would be the only way it would be authentic enough.And so here I am, looking for a network of people who support rather than discourage big dreams.  My Inspirations:I would love to do a tango like this playing violin: I would love to do the violin/harp duet to a modern pole routine like this one: This inspired me to sign up for pole classes: This is my pole-esque teacher, Angela Nelson- current national champion in Pole Sport, and incredible vixen!  This is my belly dance (and pole) teacher, Michelle Sorensen- her physique, movement, and control are endlessly mesmerizing and awe-inspiring!  
More of My Plan - Logistics:
(Simplified version- I'll post  more detail)

Base my production company in Las Vegas where there's a huge pool of talent and performance opportunities
Set up studio space and administrative infrastructure
Train, rehearse, arrange, choreograph
Record and produce music 

-distribution via digital download only through my own website and at no cost through Amazon Prime Music
-First album is already underway and will be finished by January
-Second album is in pre-production due to start recording in late November

Film videos for singles (1-3 per month depending on scale)
Social media network marketing (more detail to come- numerous linked platforms)
Jam session launch parties as singles, videos, and albums are released
Share, brainstorm and collaborate via the social media network as the creative process unfolds
Try out ideas, gain performance experience, and solicit feedback via street performing and live streaming jam sessions and rehearsals
Produce small shows early 2017 on the west coast with small cast and crew, low production costs and a shoestring travel budget 
Share and learn from this experience, plan and prepare for a bigger version
Produce more music and videos
Produce a bigger show for a tour in 2018

 

Immediate Plan & What I Need:
I don't need all that much funding to start, and I'm planning fun events along the way. Hopefully once it's off the ground, each venture will finance the next. 
I mainly need 4 things right now:


My own time to devote to this without working full time to pay bills, especially with administrative demands and building a social media network 

Administrative costs- minimal, a few hundred to register my production company and pay for a business license, accounting apps, marketing materials

Studio space to train and rehearse- I need enough studio for both dance rehearsals and and all my instruments.
Photography and video- whether it's hiring assistants through Task Rabbit to help sort the thousands of pictures and videos I have in numerous places on various devices or hiring photographers for better photos to share along the way, and ultimately videographers and editors for the videos- this is where I have the most need.

Later I will need funding for travel, musicians and sound engineers, choreographers, dancers, concert and event production. But again, I hope that if I can start creating, doing, and producing and performing, each step will raise the funds for the next.",9.0,11,"1 Campaign

Since teenager was singing here and there for years...</p><p>After she moved to Ireland and met Mimmo in person (they had already ongoing friendship relation through social media previous to that), Anna was even more motivated to start a band.</p><p>Mimmo however was already an experienced musician. Born and raised in Italy, living in Ireland for a decade at that time, had recorded many albums with various formations and bands in the past and in both countries, currently was working on promoting his first solo album with ""Aboutmeemo"". At first he was reluctant and didn't want to get involved into new project, especially with lack of serious musicians. He wanted to challenge himself in being an artistic producer of the whole project, rather than be responsible for songwriting only.</p><p>​It's important for us to share with you that first 6 songs of this<br/> album were created in literary 6 meetings. Every time we met for<br/>practice, we were leaving with a song. So after 2 months we went to<br/> studio, so happy and excited (it was Anna's first time) and<br/> unfortunately the level of ignorance and unprofessionalism we<br/> encountered there was jeopardizing the recording big time. So many<br/> arrangements and ideas were lost or compromised and in the middle of<br/>recording we had to put a stop to this treatment in order to save the<br/> album.

Since teenager was singing here and there for years...After she moved to Ireland and met Mimmo in person (they had already ongoing friendship relation through social media previous to that), Anna was even more motivated to start a band.Mimmo however was already an experienced musician. Born and raised in Italy, living in Ireland for a decade at that time, had recorded many albums with various formations and bands in the past and in both countries, currently was working on promoting his first solo album with ""Aboutmeemo"". At first he was reluctant and didn't want to get involved into new project, especially with lack of serious musicians. He wanted to challenge himself in being an artistic producer of the whole project, rather than be responsible for songwriting only.​It's important for us to share with you that first 6 songs of this album were created in literary 6 meetings. Every time we met forpractice, we were leaving with a song. So after 2 months we went to studio, so happy and excited (it was Anna's first time) and unfortunately the level of ignorance and unprofessionalism we encountered there was jeopardizing the recording big time. So many arrangements and ideas were lost or compromised and in the middle ofrecording we had to put a stop to this treatment in order to save the album. We went to another studio sharing our horrible experience and hoping that we will be able to finally finish the album in professional environment. We got unlucky again. We spent few thousandseuro for recording in spartan conditions, constantly interrupted by sound engineers talking about their private life, eating, cooking, taking phone calls, even having band practice and making us wait for him to finish in the middle of our recording!!!

<p><strong>Not So Fat Records Presents: Bands Against Bigotry</strong></p>
<p>If there is one thing everyone can agree on is that 2020 was, in short, a complete dumpster fire. Between a pandemic and civil unrest due to grave injustices we at Not So Fat Records decided that we needed to take a stand the best way we know how, through music.</p>
<p>That is why we are here asking for your help. We have put together a compilation album of Bands Against Bigotry. The purpose of this album is to connect bands who are anti- racist, pro lgbtqia+, pro feminism with each other but also with the public.</p>
<p>It’s our goal to fund and release this compilation album as well as to release other volumes in the future. We also hope to create future tours and festivals with contributing bands when touring and live music are feasible.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p>
<p>We are looking to raise a minimum of $25,000 through this campaign in order to completely fund the first production of the Double LP Vinyl, CDs, T-Shirts, and Posters. The funding will also cover the shipping materials needed to get this great stuff to you. Any extra funding will go to second printings, artist compensation, and funding towards future volumes and tour funding.</p>
<p>So, what do you get out of this you may be wondering? Well, there are a lot of options. This compilation’s first print will be EXCLUSIVELY through Indiegogo. If you want the album to be made, then you’ll have to order. We’ve got packages as simple as a t-shirt, cd, or double lp vinyl to ultimate fan package where you get all of these things plus a shout out included inside the CD insert. We also have corporate sponsorship and supporting act sponsorships available as well.</p>
<p>If we don’t reach our goal we unfortunately we won’t be able to release this amazing compilation and the funds will be returned to those who participated in our fundraising.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>While it may not seem like a really cool compilation album is making a difference in society we strongly believe it does. Music is a common thread that stitches us all together. We hope that by bringing bands together who share similar values we can impact the music scene and world for the better.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>We know that times are tough financially for many of us right now and we get it; there are other ways you can help us reach our goal. Follow and share us on social media, recommend us to your friends, family, coworkers, wherever. Every like and share helps us reach our goal!'</p>

This would give me the opportunity to meet most of the top artists nowadays which is a dream for every classical musician. Moreover, the Conservatory can offer their students a concert hall with brilliant acoustic and more than 100 “Steinway” and “Yamaha” grand pianos, which is extremely important for their further education.

My grandfather was one of the most renowned choir conductors in our country. When I was 6 he raised my love of music and I started playing the piano. In 2012 I graduated the National School of Music, Sofia and then the National Music Academy in the piano class of the famous Bulgarian pianist Prof. Ivan Drenikov. Thankfully, I was so lucky to have him for my tutor because he has been not only a student of the great Italian pianist Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli, but also has been one of his closest friends whom the Maestro spent his time with. This fact will always have an impact on me as a musician.

In 2010 I won the First Prize at the XI International Young Pianists Competition, Nis, Serbia, and later that year I became the Third Prize winner at the International Competition ""Prof. Josef Dichler"", Vienna, Austria. I was also the winner of the First Prize and Special Prize of the National Academy of Music ""Prof. P. Vladigerov"" at the IX National Competition for Students-Accompanists, Pleven, Bulgaria – 2011. Another success came in 2015, where a high-level jury awarded me the Third Prize at the First International Piano Competition ""Ciudad de Marbella"", Spain, among participants from over 20 countries. In 2015, I took part in the “Festival de Piano and Master Classes de Saint Savin”, France, and in 2016 at the “MusikFest Piano Camp” Festival in Minnesota, USA, where I had the opportunity to work with distinguished musicians such as Prof. Alexander Braginsky, Prof. Miyoko Lotto and Prof. Alexander Sklioutovsky. In August this year I participated again in the “Festival de Piano and Master Classes de Saint Savin”, France as a scholarship student. In the competition held there, the result of which is determined by the vote of the professors, artistic directors and the audience, I was one of the 4 laureates from 18 participants from 7 countries.</p><p>More information about me you can find here: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/ivanagovedarskapiano/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/ivanagovedarskapiano/</a></p><p> </p><p><strong>HOW MUCH EXACTLY DOES IT COST?</strong></p><p>Tuition fee: 3700€</p><p>Accommodation: 400€ per month</p><p>Living costs: 300€ per month</p><p>Travel costs: 60€ for a one way flight ticket with a low-cost company</p><p> </p><p>The duration of the Master Music Training is 1 year.

<h3>The Spring This Autumn</h3>
<p>The Spring This Autumn formed in 2006 and recorded and released their self-titled full length debut in 2007 without any help from a record label. After a few years of playing shows in Sweden and writing new songs, the band disbanded in 2010.</p>
<p>Early 2017 however, they reformed and on September 1st, they released the EP 'What Remains' on <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/album/2LhpuKC72qGCY3RTwoDsc6"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Spotify</a>, which contains the best songs off the full length album, to mark their return to the scene.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Now we're back.</h3>
<p>After releasing our album we resumed writing new songs, and recorded a few demo songs in 2008 and started to record an EP in 2010. Now we're looking for funding to complete these recordings and to record a few more songs written in the years since we disbanded.</p>

<h3>A True DIY Band</h3>
<p>We're a small band with big ambitions. We've always done things DIY. Everything from printing t-shirts to recording music and playing shows, designing posters and putting it all together.</p>
<p>Our self-titled debut album was limited to 200 pcs, handmade, and was wrapped in handprinted linen cloth. We love doing things our own way.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We understand that we're a small band. But we often get complimented for our music and the critical acclaim we received for our self-titled debut album is overwhelming. That's why we dare to say that we're ""The Best Band You Never Heard"".</p>
<p>All your contributions are appreciated, and we'll take what we get, and make the most out of it.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Feel free to <a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/sh/dfwxeyy7a2vlpzm/AAD25mNM_UBQBs_rk8aO0IBza?dl=0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">download our campaign videos and images</a> and share on your social media networks and with your friends.

The Spring This Autumn formed in 2006 and recorded and released their self-titled full length debut in 2007 without any help from a record label. After a few years of playing shows in Sweden and writing new songs, the band disbanded in 2010.
Early 2017 however, they reformed and on September 1st, they released the EP 'What Remains' on Spotify, which contains the best songs off the full length album, to mark their return to the scene.

Now we're back.
After releasing our album we resumed writing new songs, and recorded a few demo songs in 2008 and started to record an EP in 2010. Now we're looking for funding to complete these recordings and to record a few more songs written in the years since we disbanded.

Earlier this autumn, we digitally re-released the best songs off our self-titled debutalbum on the EP ""Whats Remains"". Now we're offering a deluxe version on Cassette (with download-code included) featuring the EP plus our Demo 2007 and 2008.

A True DIY Band
We're a small band with big ambitions. We've always done things DIY. Everything from printing t-shirts to recording music and playing shows, designing posters and putting it all together.
Our self-titled debut album was limited to 200 pcs, handmade, and was wrapped in handprinted linen cloth. We love doing things our own way.

Risks & Challenges
We understand that we're a small band. But we often get complimented for our music and the critical acclaim we received for our self-titled debut album is overwhelming. That's why we dare to say that we're ""The Best Band You Never Heard"".
All your contributions are appreciated, and we'll take what we get, and make the most out of it.

<p>Hey,</p>
<p>meine Name ist Wu und ich bin Sänger und Rapper. Mein Team und Ich leben in Köln und es gibt eine musikalische Vision, die wir teilen.

<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/001/719/806/25fa401fb7ba98c343ff8ab5d1451e81_original.JPG?v=1394228344&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=c874dce678ae370b5d1d7f868b5e1efb"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p>
<p>The Finger Friendly solution was to eliminate the necessity of those soft finger tips having to press down on those hard, narrow strings by creating a keyboard (not unlike a computer keyboard) so the player can press down on the key in order to play the string.  Your fingers simply don’t get sore any more – no matter how long you play or how infrequently you play.</p>
<h1>This Challenge of Playing Chords</h1>
<p>Well, the strings are too darn close together, even for average sized fingers like mine and for people with thick fingers, forget about it!  To add to the problem of playing clean chords, no matter how large the area above the fret is, the string has to be depressed rather close to the fret in order to produce the proper sound.  If you push the string down too far away from the fret you get a bad result – a buzzing.  Half of the area above the fret turns out to be “wasted” space – it isn’t really “useable.”  So now the effective playing area for the string are <i>really</i> close together.</p>
<p></p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/001/719/815/fb5d3199049f8205b61a6de04bf5061d_original.JPG?v=1394228471&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=affa7f53aa1a6779b3169f565df243ab"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p>
<p>So this is how <a href=""http://fingerfriendlyguitar.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Finger Friendly Guitar Keyboard</a> eliminates the problem of those strings being too darn close together:  We take our keys, which eliminate your sore finger problem, and position them in such a way as to take advantage of all that “wasted” space above the fret.  We “stack” the keys which play the strings.  The keys which play the one, three and five strings take up that heretofore “wasted” space so that the keys give your fingers a very large target area to play the string.  But the tip of the key (which makes contact with the strings) is very small <i>and</i> depresses the string close enough to the fret to produce a clean sounding note or chord.  The keys which play the two, four and six strings give you that same very large target while those smaller tips depress the strings exactly at the fret.  Once again – good, clean sounding notes and chords.</p>
<p></p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/001/719/837/cad1e4d4b046499df49a3eacba1396a4_original.JPG?v=1394228628&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=f3f1222514955760deb2cf591dc82c13"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p>
<p>And see what it enables you to do; you can play the one and three strings with only one finger – something you cannot do when playing guitar without a finger friendly keyboard; even the one, three, and five stings – only one finger.  And, of course, the same concept holds true for the two and four strings and even the two, four and six strings.  You have a very large target to play each string and you can’t touch a string you don’t intend to touch – perfect, painless chords every time.</p>
<p></p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/001/719/817/b6185459f22832008125f884c138118a_original.JPG?v=1394228484&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=deb06687f5787e95466a2dc129ed7cab"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p>
<p>And finally, thumb levers.  Most folks can’t play the strings of a guitar with their thumbs.  Now some very accomplished guitar players can manage to play the sixth string by wrapping their thumb around the guitar neck – but for the average Joe it just isn’t going to happen – <i>unless</i>…you’ve got a Finger Friendly Keyboard attached to the neck of your guitar!  The thumb levers allows you to play the sixth string and even the fifth string with the thumb; in fact you can even play them both at the same time using your thumb.</p>
<h1>How It Works</h1>
<p>The keyboard quickly and easily attaches to any standard six string acoustic or electric guitar.  Two patches of easily removable Velcro placed on the back of the neck of your guitar, and it straps firmly into place, ready to play, with absolutely no harm to your guitar.  If you’ve got more than one guitar just transfer the keyboard – easy as pie.  And, of course, you can tune your guitar with the keyboard attached.</p>
<p>The <a href=""http://fingerfriendlyguitar.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Finger Friendly Guitar Company Keyboard</a> is the one and only invitation for <i>everybody</i> to join the guitar playing party.  Now it’s not likely to turn you into the next Eric Clapton, but most of us simply want to play a nice, decent sounding guitar.  So when we’re sitting around on a Sunday morning playing our guitars they’ll be a chance that that significant other in our lives will walk by and say, “Geez honey, that sounds nice!”</p>
<h1>What We Need</h1>

<p>The Finger Friendly Guitar Company Keyboards you’ve seen in this video are 3D printer created prototypes.  In order to mass produce the parts which make up the keyboard it requires injection molds – a lot of them – a very expensive proposition.  If Indiegogo will help put the Finger Friendly Guitar Company keyboard in the marketplace I’d love to send you one at a delightful discount or even one free of charge.</p>

<p>Thanks for watching my video.  I love this invention – and I think you will too!</p>
</div><p></p><h3>Risks and challenges</h3><p>Risks:</p><p>All but one risk has been eliminated. A problem was identified, a solution was created, a patent was awarded. The final unanswered question is, ""Am I correct in assuming that a significant number of other folks will see the keyboard as an appealing solution to learning guitar?"" If I'm right, happy days! If I'm wrong, I'll make enough keyboards to thank my Indiegogo supporters and then wander on down to the Nice Try Saloon.</p><p>Challenges:</p><p>Finding an injection molding manufacturer willing and able to take on this project - very tight tolerances! Went through five ""we'll pass"" vendors before hitting pay dirt.</p><p>We haven't yet personally mastered the art of injection molding so the tricky (and costly) part of creating the keyboard is in the hands of others. Fortunately the plastics manufacturer we've chosen to work with has proven their expertise and reliability by delivering the main structure plates (to which all other parts are affixed) precisely formed and right on schedule. That leaves assembly, packaging and shipping in our own hands - which makes us feel pretty well in control of keeping our rewards promise.</p><p></p></div>","I’m Don Bacon – inventor of the Finger Friendly Guitar Company Keyboard.The objective here is to really make learning how to play the guitar not only painless, but dramatically easier than it traditionally has been.How the Idea Came to BeWhen I first attempted to learn to play guitar, I wasn’t successful.  It was a frustrating experience and I was very disappointed – I was sure I was going to become at least a decent casual guitar player.Before I retired, my occupation took me into many private homes.  And a surprising number of times I’d spot a guitar in those homes, sitting on a guitar stand in front of a fireplace or leaning in a corner, and I’d say, “Oh…do you play?”  Well it turned out there weren’t many guitar players in those homes.  The answers I’d get were, “Oh…I used to” or, “I fool around a little” or, “no, not really.”  Being a failed guitar player myself I’d pursue those conversations and invariably I’d find I was talking to folks pretty much like myself.  They’d really wanted to play the guitar but they’d become frustrated and disappointed and ended up setting their guitars aside.  But they hadn’t gotten rid of their guitars because they still wanted to play guitar.  And I learned that the reasons they had become discouraged from continuing to try learning guitar were exactly the same reasons I’d given up in my efforts. 1.Their fingers very quickly became sore after very little practice.2.They found it quite difficult to properly form the various chords you have to learn when first taking up the guitar.So two thoughts came to mind:1.There are a lot of disappointed “would be” guitar players out there.2.There must be an easier way.Well, I was right about the first thought…but I was wrong about the second thought – there was no “easier” way – I learned that by scouring the internet and visiting music stores.  Now my third thought was, “Well, there ought to be an easier way,” which brings me to the Finger Friendly Guitar Company Keyboard.The Issue of Sore FingersIf you press your soft little finger tips repeatedly down on hard, narrow steel stings – they’re going to become sore – there’s no way around it.  The only existing advice from guitar instructors is, “Well you just have to play through the pain long enough to develop callouses on your fingertips” – and of course, that’s true.  But number one, I don’t want to “play through the pain” and number two, if you start to learn guitar and then stop playing for a little while, the callouses go away.  Then when you pick up the guitar again you have to “play through the pain” all over again.  I didn’t want to play the guitar so relentlessly that the callouses would never go away – I wanted to play when the mood struck me and in a sort of casual manner.

The Finger Friendly Guitar Company Keyboard is the one and only invitation for everybody to join the guitar playing party.  Now it’s not likely to turn you into the next Eric Clapton, but most of us simply want to play a nice, decent sounding guitar.  So when we’re sitting around on a Sunday morning playing our guitars they’ll be a chance that that significant other in our lives will walk by and say, “Geez honey, that sounds nice!”
What We Need


The Finger Friendly Guitar Company Keyboards you’ve seen in this video are 3D printer created prototypes.  In order to mass produce the parts which make up the keyboard it requires injection molds – a lot of them – a very expensive proposition.  If Indiegogo will help put the Finger Friendly Guitar Company keyboard in the marketplace I’d love to send you one at a delightful discount or even one free of charge.


Thanks for watching my video.  I love this invention – and I think you will too!
Risks and challengesRisks:All but one risk has been eliminated. A problem was identified, a solution was created, a patent was awarded. The final unanswered question is, ""Am I correct in assuming that a significant number of other folks will see the keyboard as an appealing solution to learning guitar?"" If I'm right, happy days! If I'm wrong, I'll make enough keyboards to thank my Indiegogo supporters and then wander on down to the Nice Try Saloon.Challenges:Finding an injection molding manufacturer willing and able to take on this project - very tight tolerances! Went through five ""we'll pass"" vendors before hitting pay dirt.We haven't yet personally mastered the art of injection molding so the tricky (and costly) part of creating the keyboard is in the hands of others. Fortunately the plastics manufacturer we've chosen to work with has proven their expertise and reliability by delivering the main structure plates (to which all other parts are affixed) precisely formed and right on schedule. That leaves assembly, packaging and shipping in our own hands - which makes us feel pretty well in control of keeping our rewards promise.",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>I'm Kaspar Bindeman, a multidisciplinary artist from Riga, Latvia, residing in Barcelona, Spain. The major part of my creative work is music, cinema and theater, as well as graphic design and multimedia art. I have graduated from percussion class and composition class (Grammy nominee composer Pēteris Vasks), later studied design and acting. Made pretty successful career in my homeland as a musician, actor and director, then decided to spread wings, moved to Barcelona and started everything from the scratch. For the last ten years I've worked on my album, gathering the musicians from every continent, including the best professionals from Latvia, such as Inga Šļubovska, the prima donna of Latvian National Opera and Ballet, the Choir of Riga Dome Cathedral and many more. The style could be described as world music, built on the foundation of funk and rock, with a very strong Spanish and Latino flavoring and a little sprinkle of electronic, psychedelic  and academic music.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, after such a long work, I have reached the point, when my own resources are exhausted and I need your help. This first phase requires amount of €10,000 - to finish the work, left on mixing and mastering, post production of music videos, remixes, paying the distribution and promoting company for their services and eventually launch the first two singles with the videos and remixes. If I don't reach the goal, work doesn't stop, it will just go slower and at this point every cent helps to move towards the destination.</p>
<p>Regarding the perks, there is a number of options, starting song or album download, signed CD, merchandise, artwork prints, live show invitations, album presentation invitations, private gigs, etc..</p>
<p>N.B. The current list of perks is just basics and can be updated an discussed - I'm always open to creative ideas. I can even be your travel guide in Barcelona. :)) Not to mention special thanks to everyone, regardless the amount of money donated.</p>
<p>Art, especially music, is my life - through it I talk about the things I care about - love, peace, humanity, brotherhood, empathy, passion, compassion... I believe, although just a little bit, with my work I could contribute to make the world a better place.</p>
<p>Even if you can't contribute to my project financially, I'd truly appreciate if you helped to spread the word, following me on Facebook (<a href=""http://www.facebook.com/KasparBindemanMusic"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.facebook.com/KasparBindemanMusic</a>), YouTube (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/KasparBindeman"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/user/KasparBindeman</a>), Instagram (<a href=""http://www.instagram.com/kasparbindeman/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.instagram.com/kasparbindeman</a>) and Twitter (<a href=""http://twitter.com/KasparBindeman"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://twitter.com/KasparBindeman</a>)</p>

For the last ten years I've worked on my album, gathering the musicians from every continent, including the best professionals from Latvia, such as Inga Šļubovska, the prima donna of Latvian National Opera and Ballet, the Choir of Riga Dome Cathedral and many more. The style could be described as world music, built on the foundation of funk and rock, with a very strong Spanish and Latino flavoring and a little sprinkle of electronic, psychedelic  and academic music.
Unfortunately, after such a long work, I have reached the point, when my own resources are exhausted and I need your help. This first phase requires amount of €10,000 - to finish the work, left on mixing and mastering, post production of music videos, remixes, paying the distribution and promoting company for their services and eventually launch the first two singles with the videos and remixes. If I don't reach the goal, work doesn't stop, it will just go slower and at this point every cent helps to move towards the destination.
Regarding the perks, there is a number of options, starting song or album download, signed CD, merchandise, artwork prints, live show invitations, album presentation invitations, private gigs, etc..
N.B. The current list of perks is just basics and can be updated an discussed - I'm always open to creative ideas. I can even be your travel guide in Barcelona. :)) Not to mention special thanks to everyone, regardless the amount of money donated.
Art, especially music, is my life - through it I talk about the things I care about - love, peace, humanity, brotherhood, empathy, passion, compassion... I believe, although just a little bit, with my work I could contribute to make the world a better place.
Even if you can't contribute to my project financially, I'd truly appreciate if you helped to spread the word, following me on Facebook (http://www.facebook.com/KasparBindemanMusic), YouTube (http://www.youtube.com/user/KasparBindeman), Instagram (http://www.instagram.com/kasparbindeman) and Twitter (http://twitter.com/KasparBindeman)

After years of live concerts and events in Europe and South America, I've recorded <strong>my debut album</strong>.<br/>Inspired by experimentation and inclusiveness, I have created a <strong>music and painting interaction project</strong> called ""<i>Enciende el Color de la Musica</i>"" thanks to which, each song will be represented by a drawing created while the artist is listening to the song. The idea is a result to my personal desire to merge my music with its visual reflection represented by the artist’s inspiration which freely creates a drawing out of a song.</p><p><i>“If it is true that sounds touch the soul, why should it not be the same for colours?”</i><br/> V.

Recording (5 tracks Minimum)
Mixing
Mastering
We'll also use some of the Funds for the following:
Promo Shots (just the space,as we have a photographer on the team!)
Basic Merch (Get the alternative income streams up and running)
Distro (Itunes and other digital avenues)
Promo (target based ads etc.)
Why not just pay for it ourselves at the moment?Whilst we are getting ready to break local stages,and earning fees from these performances,we really need the support of the Global Musical Community until we get on our feet.We understand that in this day and age,nothing is for free,so have a look at some of our potential Rewards,once we get the ball rolling!Without music,life would have no soundtrack (Deep,We Know!)We appreciate any support you music loving folks out there can give us to push our craft and passion forward,without having to sell our kidneys!Have a look at the potential rewards,if that warm and fuzzy feeling you get for helping us reach our goal isn't enough.Feel free to check out our Social Media (we'll be adding more pages soon!)http://facebook.com/coldfieldbandzahttp://twitter.com/coldfieldzaMuch LoveCOLDFIELD",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>During the development of the Fi Station,
we’ve lost many significant artists and musicians, many of whom inspired our
work on the Fi Station, but thanks to the countless hours of wonderful music
they left behind, their inspiration lives on. </p>
<p>We can only hope that in the
future, the Fi Station will be used to add on to the catalogue of wonderful
music created by artists around the world.</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>Why do
we need your help?</b></p>
<p>For over two years, we’ve dedicated all of
our time and resources to developing the Fi Station. It was a long but
rewarding two years, with all of the time and money resulting in a stellar
product. </p>
<p>Now we’ve reached the stage where we are ready for mass production,
and that’s why we need your support. In order to reduce the cost of mass production,
we need to make a large order of the expensive high quality components that
goes into each Fi Station. </p>
<p>The development of the software is already well
underway, and we are ready to move forward with the Fi Station, but we need
more people to get involved, and give us their feedback. </p>
<p>We’d love to hear your
thoughts and suggestions by SNS or by email.</p>
<p><b>Risk
Assessment</b></p>
<p>The
riskiest part of a product launch like this has already been largely completed
– the development of the hardware. </p>
<p>We didn’t want to make any mistakes along
the way, so we spent a lot of time in the preliminary development and risk
evaluation stages, making the process of making the Fi Station as smooth as
possible.</p>
<p>Now we
are at the stage where we will analyze and test the coding of the software to
get as many of the bugs out as early as possible, but never fear, we’re ready
to speedily update the software to fix any problems our early users will meet. </p>
<p>That’s why your support and feedback are vital to us, and we look forward to
having you on board for the journey.</p>
<p><b>Purchase
or Share</b></p>
<p>Whether you decide to purchase a Fi Station
or not, we hope that you share this campaign with others. </p>
<p>You may not need a
product like this, but we’re sure you know someone who does! </p>
<p>You can share the
Fi Station to your SNS, and when the project is over, everyone who has helped
us, even those who didn’t purchase a Fi Station, will receive a gift from us.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Easter Egg</b></p>
<p>Finally, as an added bonus, we will be
developing a portable battery, special box, microphone, and other equipment for
the Fi Station, and they will all be available for a heavily discounted rate
for those who take part in this project.</p>

</div></div>","Fi Station is the first music station of
its kind in the world, combining professional sound recording, high fidelity
audio play, and 4K HD video play. Thanks to being equipped with the newest
Android system, all of these functions can be controlled by the FI Station’s
touchscreen capabilities, and with multiple inputs for hardware use of all
kinds, you’ll find that there’s little that the Fi Station can’t handle. Whether you want to record or play music, DJ, or play 4K HD quality video
through it, the Fi Station can handle any request with ease.These days, music products can feel more
like robotic, highly technical machines that are designed for a small number of
hardcore professionals. They’re often expensive single function products that
have poor user experience, and this is something that we felt needed to be
improved upon. Sometimes you find yourself needing to buy several products to
meet your different needs – you might need a professional sound card to record,
a Hi-Fi player to listen back to lossless audio, and a separate TV box to play
HD videos. And even after you’ve bought all of these separate products, you’ll
find that very few of them are compatible with each other. That’s why we
created the Fi Station – an easy to use product that can be used in different
scenarios, with high quality input and output capabilities, neatly wrapped up
in a stylish design.






























During the development of the Fi Station,
we’ve lost many significant artists and musicians, many of whom inspired our
work on the Fi Station, but thanks to the countless hours of wonderful music
they left behind, their inspiration lives on. 
We can only hope that in the
future, the Fi Station will be used to add on to the catalogue of wonderful
music created by artists around the world.




Why do
we need your help?
For over two years, we’ve dedicated all of
our time and resources to developing the Fi Station. It was a long but
rewarding two years, with all of the time and money resulting in a stellar
product. 
Now we’ve reached the stage where we are ready for mass production,
and that’s why we need your support. In order to reduce the cost of mass production,
we need to make a large order of the expensive high quality components that
goes into each Fi Station. 
The development of the software is already well
underway, and we are ready to move forward with the Fi Station, but we need
more people to get involved, and give us their feedback. 
We’d love to hear your
thoughts and suggestions by SNS or by email.
Risk
Assessment
The
riskiest part of a product launch like this has already been largely completed
– the development of the hardware. 
We didn’t want to make any mistakes along
the way, so we spent a lot of time in the preliminary development and risk
evaluation stages, making the process of making the Fi Station as smooth as
possible.
Now we
are at the stage where we will analyze and test the coding of the software to
get as many of the bugs out as early as possible, but never fear, we’re ready
to speedily update the software to fix any problems our early users will meet. 
That’s why your support and feedback are vital to us, and we look forward to
having you on board for the journey.
Purchase
or Share
Whether you decide to purchase a Fi Station
or not, we hope that you share this campaign with others. 
You may not need a
product like this, but we’re sure you know someone who does! 
You can share the
Fi Station to your SNS, and when the project is over, everyone who has helped
us, even those who didn’t purchase a Fi Station, will receive a gift from us.

Easter Egg
Finally, as an added bonus, we will be
developing a portable battery, special box, microphone, and other equipment for
the Fi Station, and they will all be available for a heavily discounted rate
for those who take part in this project.

<p>In September 2017 we have released successful album ""To the Northern seas"" on major folk-pagan label Soundage productions. We are  proud of it!

<p>This legend begins since very Ancient times when the brave sons of the North ruled this glorious land, named Sleepland. This peaceful country had been ruled by the Race of Kings till it faced a mighty power of the Woodlands’ attackers. As the Prophecy tells it was the wrath of the Ancient Gods, who had brought down the mighty fellowship and all the power warriors were expelled from their native land, and the way there became covered with a veil of mists. Nobody knew what had happened to the rulers of these lands and why the path to the Northern seas was cursed…</p>
<p>Years passed, and once, a descendant of the Northern kings Thorgard by name had a vision. He learned that the time to return the lost Ancient land of his Forefathers came, but a really great warrior had to be chosen to lead the ship thought the waves and mists. The warrior had to resist the impacts of disasters, had to be able to return the path to the Northern seas for fellowship and break the Gods’ curse. The Ruler had lots of brave and faithful warriors and each of them could give his life for the Northern lands, but there was no the Warrior. So the wise Thorgard once gathered his courageous and ready to sail to the Northern seas men on the seashore and told them about his vision. Thorgard looked at the fellowship and saw light brighter than the star shine in one’s eyes and heard a heartbeat through hundreds of other sounds. He found him, the Warrior. He was the one written about in the prophecy!!! He was Halmar – chosen by the Gods!!!</p>
<p>With the first sunshine rays the fellowship started sailing to the Northern seas. Drakkar so famous in the sea battles had been one of the courageous warriors itself now became home for the heroes. Storm-clouds were brewing and the shroud of mist covered the Drakkar. The path became harder and harder. Only the bright hymns of Scald really helped our brave sons of The Northern lands. Suddenly, the surface of the sea became waves and all the fury of the winds hit the board. So they met the great storm from prophecy and none seemed to be able to escape his inglorious death. But Halmar rose from his knees and covered all the warriors with his shield from the furious winds and waves. After the long battle with his shield in his hands he helped one sunray to break through the Grey mists and cold dark waves. The Ship passed the obstacle and before the fellowship appeared Sleepland – the forgotten land of their Forefathers. The prophecy became true, and the brave warriors went ashore in the sunset. They were met by the native lands and fjords, cold winds and songs of the sea surf. But would the paths on these lands be so glorious? And what adventures would wait for our Sons of the North in the next battle?</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What's wrong with labels now?</h3>
<p>This is an easy question to answer in industry talk, but let's point some things out in simpler words:</p>
<ul>
<li>Artists frequently sign 3- 5 album deals limiting control of their future from day one.</li>
<li>After signing, they're only entitled to 12% of the PROFITS from sales.</li>
<li>Musicians contractually get paid quarterly from their labels. Commonly not at all.</li>
<li>Most labels own those recordings/rights FORVER and will continue to profit off of them long after they've crashed and burned an artist's career to increase said profit. ""Churn and burn""</li>
<li>Artists have a particularly high rate of mental health issues, addiction problems and homelessness inside of their community. Much of this is fueled by financial circumstance as a result of poor treatment in the industry.</li>
<li>Since they're in competition with other media companies, labels often fail to incorporate these alternate revenue streams for their artists.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What Are We Doing About It?</h3>
<ul>
<li>One album deals at a time. We'll never own an artist's future. Ever.</li>
<li>50-50 deals on everything we'll ever touch.</li>
<li>Monthly and weekly paydays for various royalty types. Daily payouts are on the table but we'll need to kill it out of the gates to make it real;)</li>
<li>Once an artist completes their contract, they own the recordings, rights and royalties to THEIR music outright. Forever.</li>
<li>Every One Off artist will complete an online workshop focused on business education and addiction / risk awareness in our field of work.</li>
<li>Making things like, contracts, statements, and sales metrics public information.</li>
<li>Focusing on other areas of the industry our artists can create constant residual income from, and facilitating/promoting it for them as well.</li>
<li>As a stretch goal, we're launching a housing initiative to put a roof over 3-5 musicians heads for the first 6 months of our operation while giving them 24/7 access to studio time and other content based resources.

<p><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">ABOUT VIDEO: the second part of ""musical component"" in this conceptual art by Jan Poope comprises of an Italian medical device Sirio <strong>(see the video above)</strong>, originally designed for healing injuries with low-frequency ultrasound waves. Author noticed a peculiar side effect – whistling sounds within the patient’s head. Outside observers hear nothing, but the experimental object experiences an intensive acoustic perception. Low-frequency ultrasound waves are modulated as they travel through the body (a bit like a dental drill). Ultrasound scratching on human bodies is a brand new music genre. </i><b><i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">S</span>irio device is not part of the project an Indiegogo!</i></b><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></i></p>
<p>
Audiopill (pill) will make you feel like you are standing in the middle of a concert hall with a powerful audiosystem inside your body. Or like you are standing in a factory workshop full metal working machines and ramming an impact drill into your stomach. The only diference is there’s an absolute silence all around and you are experiencing the music in perfect privacy and only from the inside. </p>
<p>After swallowing, it takes the Audiopill about an hour to make it through the upper parts of gastrointestinal tract (in the first minutes you have to press your palm on your chest to feel the beats). But after it descends to the pelvic area, the effects become very intensive. You may for a while regret your experimental courage.</p>
<p>

This world-unique and experimental device for enjoying music from the inside is small as a pill. When swallowed it starts beating within you innards at a preset BPM. Restless feeling will pump you up to insanity. 

ABOUT VIDEO: the second part of ""musical component"" in this conceptual art by Jan Poope comprises of an Italian medical device Sirio (see the video above), originally designed for healing injuries with low-frequency ultrasound waves. Author noticed a peculiar side effect – whistling sounds within the patient’s head. Outside observers hear nothing, but the experimental object experiences an intensive acoustic perception. Low-frequency ultrasound waves are modulated as they travel through the body (a bit like a dental drill). Ultrasound scratching on human bodies is a brand new music genre. Sirio device is not part of the project an Indiegogo!

Audiopill (pill) will make you feel like you are standing in the middle of a concert hall with a powerful audiosystem inside your body. Or like you are standing in a factory workshop full metal working machines and ramming an impact drill into your stomach. The only diference is there’s an absolute silence all around and you are experiencing the music in perfect privacy and only from the inside. 
After swallowing, it takes the Audiopill about an hour to make it through the upper parts of gastrointestinal tract (in the first minutes you have to press your palm on your chest to feel the beats). But after it descends to the pelvic area, the effects become very intensive. You may for a while regret your experimental courage.

You are at a 10-hour party of one and only hypnotic rhythm, and there’s nowhere to escape. 

The beating within you abdomen induces a unique feeling of restlessness, amazement and elation, but if you have a shorter life than the battery inside (10 hours and can’t be switched off when swallowed!), it can pump you up to insanity. And there’s yet another effect the Audiopill provides. As it meanders through your GI tract, it can serve as a teaching aid for your own medical or even maniacal introspection.
How to use it

<p><strong>THE DREAM</strong></p>
<p><strong><i>Feeling Radio is just …..“Magic”</i></strong></p>
<p>Four years ago, a man called George, a dreamer of  love and music, managed to make his dream come true by the help of Itube Enterprises Feelings Radio Group. Having met a few more people with the same music dream, started broadcasting music in May 2013…and that’ s when music becomes love…and love becomes a voice!</p>
<p>Only after had the microphone been switched on for the first time, they realized that broadcasting was not just a dream. On August 3rd, 2014, George &amp; Andreas, the main group, presented their own radio program on air, and Feelings Radio just started its own trip all over the world.</p>
<p><strong><i>Feelings Radio makes history….. </i></strong></p>
<p>Being the first web radio station in the world with animated background and interactive site with welcome message to all listeners, Feelings Radio makes history! It is located next to the sea, in Piraeus, with a marvelous view to the main port, where all boats and passengers start their own trip…</p>
<p><i>But…..without all you….your love and support to our dreams….nothing would have happened….</i></p>
<p>George Ntoukas &amp; his partners, Itube Enterprises &amp; Feelings Radio, would like to thank you all in advance for your love and support in order to make OUR dream comes true.</p>

<p>Hi friends,</p>

My name is Sonya and I live in Armenia.  Months ago I was supported with the
Turkey-Armenia Travel Grant to visit Istanbul for creating digital mapping of
the Armenian cultural heritage in Istanbul. The program was very close to my
heart because my roots come from Turkey. As a painter I know how the art and
culture can reflect the things that are impossible to express with the help of
words. This was a little project and it is already over.<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433056196/thkl0vdvawtgrcnmhvar.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3></h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>    We could finish this project with the help of my Turkish friend, we are both volunteers. Now we are creating a nice website which will help tourists from all over the
world  to consider and choose the nearest
active church and to find it easily in Turkey. Our aim is to make our own little step for normalization of the relationship between
two neighborhood countries. But<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""> we are not going to stop on Istanbul only, there
are hundreds of ancient churches and monasteries  spred in Turkey, the majority of which are
either in ruins or are being used for other purposes. Many of them are still in
active use and they belong to various denominations.</span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433056418/gyn9xj0kpuawq97ehjyj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">   So my target is to

for future. To realize this dream, we need your support. </span></p>
<p>Your donations will help make this field trip possible! We
believe that the ancient cultural places will brighten up the the lives of
those who will see them. Most importantly, this event will be so exceptional
for many faithful people! </p>

costs and the professional camera will contribute to the later development of the project (before we were using our phones), through your contribution we will be provided plane tickets to Turkey
and back, funds raised will also go towards the printing of postcard size
images of the cultural heritage of both countries and publishing the future photobook. </p>

<h3>About Us</h3>
<p><strong><i>Waking Dreams </i></strong>came alive in the dark Berlin, Angela Chambers and Jason Letkiewicz came together in collaboration with Cameron Findlay on drums. Written and recorded in Berlin. Mixed in Baltimore, USA. Their debut album ‘'Askew’' will be released on vinyl and digitally in April 2020 along with three singles from the album.</p>
<p>Angela and Jason first met in New York in 2012, where they recorded their first songs together. Shortly after, Angela moved to Berlin and Jason came over in 2015, and they began work on their first studio album <i>‘'</i>Askew<i>''. </i>At the time, both were coming from Electronic, House, and Italo Disco backgrounds. While holding on to elements of the past, their debut album ‘'Askew’' adds an Indie-pop rock twist to the equation. They perform live as a duo, with Angela writing and singing deep velvety vocals, intertwined with hypnotic synth and flute melodies, meanwhile Jason plays mesmerising guitar harmonies weeping around rhythmic bass lines. In 2018 and 2019, Waking Dreams toured in the Europe and in the US.</p>

</h2><br/><div style=""text-align: center;"">
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>As a musician (vocalist) I have always wanted to make a connection with mankind through my music because it is possible touch people very deeply and in different ways when you make music from the bottom of your heart. </b><br/>
</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Many people in today's society face daily challenges and I believe that those challenges can be easier to face if we feel real empathy with the world around us.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">I did some research by talking to friends and strangers: people are struggling and although they manage to survive somehow, they often feel left alone. <br/>For this reason I started looking for a way to make a difference in their lives.<br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">My first stop was the <a href=""http://viragecancer.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">VIRAGE Foundation</a>. It is an agency that provides assistance during cancer treatment. VIRAGE also helps people with reintegrate into society and gives them back their dignity.<br/>
</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Finally I have found my first platform where music can make a change by giving people hope, freedom and a measure of peace in their daily life. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">WHY A CD?</h2>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>We will make a recording with jazzy-classical music, with standards and songs composed by the great <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Thompson_%28musician%29"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Don Thompson</a></b>.<b> </b>
</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In 2010 I founded <a href=""https://www.triodesiree.ca/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Trio Désirée</a> with cellist <a href=""https://www.triodesiree.ca/bios/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Coenraad Bloemendal</a> and harpist <a href=""https://www.triodesiree.ca/bios/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Erica Goodman</a>, both renowned Canadian musicians. Through Coenraad I met Don Thompson, who helped us by composing a piece for our group called ""Autumn Nostalgia"". And so
 we started this wonderful journey combining jazz with classical 
music!<br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Thanks to Don's  magical jazzy arrangements, I am able to sing with my classically trained voice in a jazz style. This unique approach has opened up a hidden world of of truth and beauty that I had never before experienced. Don's musical sensitivity has touched us all. 

</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We will work in collaboration
with the VIRAGE Foundation and its patients for having a unique CD that can be
used within the workshops VIRAGE is offering. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Later, in 2016, the <a href=""http://viragecancer.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">VIRAGE</a> Foundation will organize a fundraising event where we will perform songs from our new CD. We will give the CD's to the foundation to help them in order for them to raise money and give people pleasure at the same time. <br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>This is the start of real empathy, real help and end to isolation!</b><br/></p>
<br/>
<p><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">HOW CAN YOU HELP?</h2>
<br/><h4 style=""text-align: center;"">Every time you donate a dollar, you will help twice:<br/>
</h4>
<ul>
<li><h4 style=""text-align: center;"">to build awareness of people with cancer</h4></li>
<li><h4 style=""text-align: center;""> by supporting the fine work of the VIRAGE foundation</h4></li>

</div></div>","ENGLISH VERSION (à noter: traduction en français en bas!)THE IDEA!

As a musician (vocalist) I have always wanted to make a connection with mankind through my music because it is possible touch people very deeply and in different ways when you make music from the bottom of your heart. 


Many people in today's society face daily challenges and I believe that those challenges can be easier to face if we feel real empathy with the world around us.
I did some research by talking to friends and strangers: people are struggling and although they manage to survive somehow, they often feel left alone. For this reason I started looking for a way to make a difference in their lives.
My first stop was the VIRAGE Foundation. It is an agency that provides assistance during cancer treatment. VIRAGE also helps people with reintegrate into society and gives them back their dignity.

Finally I have found my first platform where music can make a change by giving people hope, freedom and a measure of peace in their daily life. 


WHY A CD?

We will make a recording with jazzy-classical music, with standards and songs composed by the great Don Thompson. 


In 2010 I founded Trio Désirée with cellist Coenraad Bloemendal and harpist Erica Goodman, both renowned Canadian musicians. Through Coenraad I met Don Thompson, who helped us by composing a piece for our group called ""Autumn Nostalgia"". And so
 we started this wonderful journey combining jazz with classical 
music!
Thanks to Don's  magical jazzy arrangements, I am able to sing with my classically trained voice in a jazz style. This unique approach has opened up a hidden world of of truth and beauty that I had never before experienced. Don's musical sensitivity has touched us all. 


We will work in collaboration
with the VIRAGE Foundation and its patients for having a unique CD that can be
used within the workshops VIRAGE is offering. 
Later, in 2016, the VIRAGE Foundation will organize a fundraising event where we will perform songs from our new CD. We will give the CD's to the foundation to help them in order for them to raise money and give people pleasure at the same time. 
This is the start of real empathy, real help and end to isolation!




HOW CAN YOU HELP?
Every time you donate a dollar, you will help twice:


to build awareness of people with cancer
 by supporting the fine work of the VIRAGE foundation


We need a total of $12,000 to reach our goal and to make a difference in someone's life. If we reach the required amount, we will make a recording in Toronto at Inception Sound with the great  Chad Irschick (sound engineer), Don Thompson (piano, vibes), Coenraad Bloemendal (cello), Erica Goodman (harp) and Désirée Till (soprano).
Later on in 2016, VIRAGE will organize a concert for us where we will officially donate CD's to the Foundation. VIRAGE will sell the donated CDs and uses them for its activities. 
If we do not reach our 
goal, all contributions will be refunded within 3-5 business days, we won't be able to make a recording nor spread the feeling of empathy as we would like to do!
Please note: contributions can only be made by PayPal.
So let's focus on positive thoughts; let's hope, let's fund and make some music!





OR HELP IN A DIFFERENT WAY!

If you
cannot contribute, but still want to show your empathy ... no problem! You
can still help to get this recording done by doing the following:

1. Tell everyone you
know about our wonderful project. Please SHARE this
campaign on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, your blog, etc.2.  LIKE here our Facebook page to stay informed 3. stay informed through TWITTER @musicvirage!4. You can always
contact Desiree with questions or ideas: musicvirage@gmail.com. 



WHERE DOES THE MONEY GO?

It will cost us $12,000 CAD to make this recording. This amount covers
all direct expenses related to the recording. 

It is not a salary for the musicians.

Once the recording is finished, ERDECO recordings will prepare it for online distribution. 
Here are the details:

UNE IDÉE NAÎT




En tant que musicienne (chanteuse), j’utilise ma
musique pour tisser des relations avec autrui; la musique a cette particularité
qu’elle nous touche profondément et diversement lorsqu’elle naît du fond du
cœur. 




Nous
sommes confrontés au quotidien à toutes sortes de défis. Je pense que ces défis
seraient assumés plus facilement si nous étions réellement capables d’empathie.
Ayant
sondé amis et étrangers, je me suis rendu compte que beaucoup de gens n’ont pas
la vie facile et se sentent souvent isolés même s’ils réussissent à se tirer
d’affaire. Aussi, j’ai commencé à chercher une façon de changer les choses.
Je me suis alors tournée vers la Fondation Virage pour le soutien au cancer, dont le travail permet aussi aux
personnes de reprendre leur dignité et de se réinsérer dans la vie active.Voilà
donc une façon d’utiliser la musique pour embellir le quotidien des personnes
atteintes du cancer, faisant germer chez elles l’espoir et un sentiment de
liberté et de paix!





POURQUOI UN CD?

Nous allons enregistrer de la musique
classique jazzy, avec des standards et des chansons composés par le grand Don Thompson.


En 2010, j’ai fondé Trio Désirée avec le violoncelliste Coenraad Bloemendal et la harpiste Erica Goodman, deux musiciens canadiens de renom. Par l’entremise
de Coenraad j’ai rencontré Don Thompson, qui a composé pour notre groupe la
pièce intitulée Autumn Nostalgia. Ainsi a démarré une merveilleuse
expérience qui combine le jazz et la musique classique.
Grâce aux arrangements magiques de Don,
je peux chanter du jazz, moi qui suis formée à la musique classique. Cette
approche originale nous amène dans un monde d’authenticité et de beauté qui
m’était jusque là inconnu. La sensibilité musicale de Don nous a tous touchés.
Nous
allons travailler en collaboration avec la Fondation Virage et ses patients en
vue de créer un CD unique qui pourra être utilisé dans les ateliers qu’elle
offre.
Dans le cadre d’une activité de
financement qui sera organisée par la Fondation Virage en 2016, nous
allons présenter des chansons de notre nouveau CD et offrirons des copies à la
fondation à la fois pour aider à la collecte de fonds et pour égayer les gens.


C’est
ici que commencent l’empathie et l’aide effective et que prend fin l’isolement!

Comment pouvez-vous
aider?

Vos dons remplissent deux fonctions:

Sensibiliser
le public aux épreuves que traversent les personnes atteintes du cancer; 
Soutenir
le travail extraordinaire réalisé par la Fondation Virage.


Nous avons fixé notre objectif à
12 000 $CA pour changer la vie de quelqu’un. Si nous atteignons le montant
établi, nous pourrons enregistrer notre CD à Toronto dans les studios de Inception Sound avec le soutien du grand ingénieur du son Chad Irschick; seront au piano et au vibraphone Don Thompson, au violoncelle Coenraad Bloemendal, à la harpe Erica Goodman et à la voix (soprano) Désirée Till.
En

ferons don officiellement de copies de notre CD. La fondation en vendra

Important :
Les dons peuvent être reçus par l’entremise de PayPal uniquement.
Restons positifs, gardons espoir, soyons

I am here to raise funds to produce a new CD of piano music, featuring Marie-Luise playing a solo-piano version of J.S. Bach's ""Cello Suite #1"", plus a collection of her very own new original compositions inspired by and dedicated to animals! </p><p>Bach's Cello Suite #1 is the most famous composition ever written for cello (Yo Yo Ma's rendition is part of popular culture). The piece is rarely ever heard on the piano. But after Marie-Luise received the sheet music as a gift, she enjoyed the music so much that she wanted to share her enthusiasm for this great masterpiece with the world through a recording of her own interpretation on piano.

I am here to raise funds to produce a new CD of piano music, featuring Marie-Luise playing a solo-piano version of J.S. Bach's ""Cello Suite #1"", plus a collection of her very own new original compositions inspired by and dedicated to animals! Bach's Cello Suite #1 is the most famous composition ever written for cello (Yo Yo Ma's rendition is part of popular culture). The piece is rarely ever heard on the piano. But after Marie-Luise received the sheet music as a gift, she enjoyed the music so much that she wanted to share her enthusiasm for this great masterpiece with the world through a recording of her own interpretation on piano. If there was ever a musician who was meant to bring this piece to life on the piano, it is Marie-Luise Hinrichs.

<h3>About me</h3>
<p>My name is Anna Bulkina and I'm a concert pianist. During my life I was traveling a lot all over the world, experiencing the life of a freelancer artist. I visited many countries and played in many beautiful venues. One of the countries that I particularly liked was Germany. Composers of German Romanticism always were among my favorite. When I visited cities where they lived and worked, had their triumphs and fails, love and death - their music became much more meaningful for me. After my first visit to this country the idea of CD crossed my mind. I picket two significant works of two the most brilliant composers of this period - Schumann and Brahms. </p>
<p>Another facet of the CD is an anthology of Russian composers that studied or worked in Moscow Conservatory.  Although I did not do it deliberately, somehow one can clearly see the line of composers started with Tchaikovsky and finished with Gubaydulina, representatives of one school but so different from each other, with different lives and destinies. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Where the money go</h3>
<p>The audio material of the CD is already complete. I only need to launch it now with the recording company. The budget will go for post- production costs, printing and distribution costs. This last step turned out to be the most hard one in terms of funds. Here I need you to go with me on this journey and I'm sure that together we can bring this project to life!</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p>First &amp; foremost, thank you so much for taking the time to look at my campaign. This is something I have spent my whole life building up to and it really does mean the world to me - quite literally.</p>
<p>I have big visions &amp; a strong desire to make a powerful, peaceful impact within our global community - through following my passions, staying within my truth and sharing my experience along the way.</p>
<p>My belief is that we are all connected and when we cooperate together alongside nature, supporting one another, we can build a world of all-encompassing unification.</p>
<p>To me, this means a world without violence, poverty or suffering of any kind. A place where every living being thrives, as they should within accordance of the laws of the universe.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">❈❈❈</p>
<p>As far back as I can remember, art &amp; music have been my two of my greatest passions. Over the years I have explored them in many ways from abstract painting &amp; manual photography to playing bass in a rock band as a teenager.</p>
<p>I am now at the stage in my lifetime where I have chosen a specific set of artistic crafts, with the intention to develop and master them - namely, these are - producing music &amp; videos, DJing and creating mandalas.</p>
<p>Alongside this, I am a very spiritual being and strongly believe in the power of meditation; as it was upon my discovery of this, that my life truly changed for the better.</p>

<p>My 3 main goals from this campaign are as follows:</p>

<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">❈ To fund the production of my upcoming LP entitled 'Eudaimonia' with release set for Summer 2018 AD!</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">❈ To enable me to upgrade my portable technology - this helps me with music &amp; video production, keeping you updated on my experience, capturing photos &amp; footage and taking care of business while I'm travelling!</p>
<p>The outcome however means so much more - each of these goals contribute to providing a platform for me to share my experience, creativity &amp; insight with the world on a massive scale...</p>

<p>The reason for the relatively short timeframe in which to reach my target is because of the proximity to me traveling (and it also makes it rather fun, don't you think?!) However, I will extend the campaign after this so you can keep investing even after the initial deadline has passed...this is part of a much bigger ongoing project so the more the merrier!</p>

<p>As mentioned above, the outcome of this campaign means a great deal - allow me to delve deeper…</p>
<p>I first visited India in March 2017 AD - this was such a special and monumental time for me as my Grandmother grew up in Gujarat before relocating to Uganda &amp; then the UK as a refugee (now this is a whole other story!) It felt so amazingly incredible to re-connect with some of my roots &amp; one of my homelands...</p>

<p>During my time in Goa I was able to finally meet one of the founders &amp; some of the children housed by 'El Shaddai Charitable Trust' - this is a truly wonderful charity that a good friend of mine had already introduced me to &amp; we support from the UK.</p>
<p>The only words I have for this situation is 'pure love'. I will never forget the moment I first saw all those beautiful faces beaming up at me, their gazes touched my soul…I couldn't imagine what some of them would have endured in their young lives, yet they are all just so full of love, to the point where I felt completely surrounded and engulfed by it - they brought me into complete alignment with my true nature.</p>

<p>And It was on this day that a major part of my purpose in life became clear to me - to help El Shaddai expand across India and also to learn from them, so I can go on to set up services similar to theirs in other parts of the world.</p>

<p>On my return from India with my new gained clarity, I decided it was time I really started stepping up in life in order to see my visions become reality. I invested in mentoring, began offering a bespoke mandala service &amp; after 10 years of dreaming about it - I began DJing as part of the independent, Leeds UK based, label - Released.</p>
<p> I started with more traditional vinyl record DJing and I am now also expanding my horizons and taking to the MP3/CDJs as well - enabling me to play a variety of venues and travel much easier while doing so. </p>

</div></div>","❈ Hello & Welcome! ❈
My name is Aneesha - I am an Artist, DJ, Music Producer, Video Creator, Motivational Speaker, Empath, Healer & Lover of Life!

 
First & foremost, thank you so much for taking the time to look at my campaign. This is something I have spent my whole life building up to and it really does mean the world to me - quite literally.
I have big visions & a strong desire to make a powerful, peaceful impact within our global community - through following my passions, staying within my truth and sharing my experience along the way.
My belief is that we are all connected and when we cooperate together alongside nature, supporting one another, we can build a world of all-encompassing unification.
To me, this means a world without violence, poverty or suffering of any kind. A place where every living being thrives, as they should within accordance of the laws of the universe.

❈❈❈
As far back as I can remember, art & music have been my two of my greatest passions. Over the years I have explored them in many ways from abstract painting & manual photography to playing bass in a rock band as a teenager.
I am now at the stage in my lifetime where I have chosen a specific set of artistic crafts, with the intention to develop and master them - namely, these are - producing music & videos, DJing and creating mandalas.
Alongside this, I am a very spiritual being and strongly believe in the power of meditation; as it was upon my discovery of this, that my life truly changed for the better.
 


 
❈❈❈
 
 

 
My 3 main goals from this campaign are as follows:
❈ To help fund my visit to India this December - where I'll be spending time in Samarpan ashrams, DJing, creating art & investing time with the charity I support.
❈ To fund the production of my upcoming LP entitled 'Eudaimonia' with release set for Summer 2018 AD!
❈ To enable me to upgrade my portable technology - this helps me with music & video production, keeping you updated on my experience, capturing photos & footage and taking care of business while I'm travelling!
The outcome however means so much more - each of these goals contribute to providing a platform for me to share my experience, creativity & insight with the world on a massive scale...
❈❈❈


 

The reason for the relatively short timeframe in which to reach my target is because of the proximity to me traveling (and it also makes it rather fun, don't you think?!) However, I will extend the campaign after this so you can keep investing even after the initial deadline has passed...this is part of a much bigger ongoing project so the more the merrier!
❈❈❈

 
As mentioned above, the outcome of this campaign means a great deal - allow me to delve deeper…
I first visited India in March 2017 AD - this was such a special and monumental time for me as my Grandmother grew up in Gujarat before relocating to Uganda & then the UK as a refugee (now this is a whole other story!) It felt so amazingly incredible to re-connect with some of my roots & one of my homelands...

❈❈❈

During my time in Goa I was able to finally meet one of the founders & some of the children housed by 'El Shaddai Charitable Trust' - this is a truly wonderful charity that a good friend of mine had already introduced me to & we support from the UK.
The only words I have for this situation is 'pure love'. I will never forget the moment I first saw all those beautiful faces beaming up at me, their gazes touched my soul…I couldn't imagine what some of them would have endured in their young lives, yet they are all just so full of love, to the point where I felt completely surrounded and engulfed by it - they brought me into complete alignment with my true nature.

And It was on this day that a major part of my purpose in life became clear to me - to help El Shaddai expand across India and also to learn from them, so I can go on to set up services similar to theirs in other parts of the world.

Eudaimonia - I first came across this concept while studying the philosophies of Aristotle. It excited me as I felt like I had finally found a theory that encapsulated what I believe life is all about - achieving a state of sheer happiness through living up to your full potential.
There are various theories and definitions of the word - one I like is ""human flourishing"".
To me, Eudaimonia is the highest state of mind and existence, true divine nature; love - achievable by anyone & that I am in everyday of life :)
 

The first single & video is set for digital release in Spring 2018 AD with the full LP following both digitally and on vinyl in Summer 2018 AD.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Contributors fund ideas they can be passionate about and to people they trust. Here are some things to do in this section:</p>
<p>Hi,I'm Carl Orr, a London-based guitarist and composer. I have performed jazz and jazz-influenced music all over the world with some of the finest musicians in the world including Billy Cobham,George Duke,Randy Brecker,Ernie Watts,Bennie Maupin and Don Grusin, and I have jammed onstage with the likes of Marcus Miller, Nigel Kennedy, Bill Summers and Eric Krasno . I have written lots of material for the globally popular Rockshool guitar exams and I write production music for Warner Brothers. I have recorded eight albums of my original compositions and am now working on the ninth. I am happily married and my wife and I have two grown-up kids.</p>
<p>My aim is to create music of the highest standards with a truly original approach. I have  used my background and training in jazz performance and composition to create music which is simpler and more accessible than most modern jazz. My compositions feature memorable melodies, concise solos and meticulously crafted rhythms.Some of the rhythms are strong and funky and some are gentle and soothing but all of them will capture and hold your attention. I also focus a lot on varied instrumentation and the album features a great many instruments; electric and acoustic guitars, bass, grand piano, electric piano, Hammond organ, drums, percussion, soprano saxophone, bass clarinet, violin, voice,sitar, tablas, gyill(a Ghanaian marimba-like instrument) and oud(Turkish stringed instrument).</p>
<p>I grew up listening to the great pop music of the sixties and seventies and my aim is to make modern, mostly instrumental music with the warmth and emotional generosity of the music of the great artists I grew up listening to; artists like The Beatles,Stevie Wonder, James Taylor, Aretha Franklin,Joni Mitchell, Glen Campbell, Burt Bacharach, Simon and Garfunkel and Donny Hathaway. The following track from my previous album, 'Forbearance' is an excellent example of this approach.</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/MpTOGIOQe-k?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<div> </div>
<div>My aim is to make music that you can either listen to in a concentrated way or you can put on in  the home to create a warm, inviting and energised atmosphere, or you can listen to it while you are walking, driving or travelling by plane, bus or train to help to pass the time in a more enjoyable way. A man who bought my last album says he puts it on every morning while his family are eating breakfast as it creates a great mood to start the day.</div>
<div>I strongly feel that world needs to hear this music.</div>
<div>Our precious world is increasingly becoming a frightening and dangerous place and music is needed more than ever to make people feel calm and reassured. For me it is simply not good enough for  my music to simply be a manifestation of a chaotic world. However this is not 'new age' or background music; this is music of great power and energy. I am a performing musician of 37 years experience and I have played at many of the world's major jazz festivals and jazz clubs, so I am highly experienced in creating music to connect with and energise audiences. </div>
<div>I purposefully create music with the aim of completely engaging the listener, drawing them in with beautiful sounds, compelling rhythms and melodies that will capture and retain their attention, so they can forget about their problems for a while, think clearly about life and gather their strength to move their life forward in the best possible way.</div>
<div>The risks and challenges are as follows; there is always the risk that an artist will not complete a project. However, this project is now at a very advanced stage; I estimate that 70% of the work has been done.

<div>The challenges also are largely completed; the main challenges are writing and rehearsing the music, booking the musicians and recording followed by the practicalities of artwork,  distribution, disc pressing and promotion.

<p>Can you help me to get this important music out into the world?</p>
</div></div>","Short Summary
Contributors fund ideas they can be passionate about and to people they trust. Here are some things to do in this section:
Hi,I'm Carl Orr, a London-based guitarist and composer. I have performed jazz and jazz-influenced music all over the world with some of the finest musicians in the world including Billy Cobham,George Duke,Randy Brecker,Ernie Watts,Bennie Maupin and Don Grusin, and I have jammed onstage with the likes of Marcus Miller, Nigel Kennedy, Bill Summers and Eric Krasno . I have written lots of material for the globally popular Rockshool guitar exams and I write production music for Warner Brothers. I have recorded eight albums of my original compositions and am now working on the ninth. I am happily married and my wife and I have two grown-up kids.
My aim is to create music of the highest standards with a truly original approach. I have  used my background and training in jazz performance and composition to create music which is simpler and more accessible than most modern jazz. My compositions feature memorable melodies, concise solos and meticulously crafted rhythms.Some of the rhythms are strong and funky and some are gentle and soothing but all of them will capture and hold your attention. I also focus a lot on varied instrumentation and the album features a great many instruments; electric and acoustic guitars, bass, grand piano, electric piano, Hammond organ, drums, percussion, soprano saxophone, bass clarinet, violin, voice,sitar, tablas, gyill(a Ghanaian marimba-like instrument) and oud(Turkish stringed instrument).
I grew up listening to the great pop music of the sixties and seventies and my aim is to make modern, mostly instrumental music with the warmth and emotional generosity of the music of the great artists I grew up listening to; artists like The Beatles,Stevie Wonder, James Taylor, Aretha Franklin,Joni Mitchell, Glen Campbell, Burt Bacharach, Simon and Garfunkel and Donny Hathaway. The following track from my previous album, 'Forbearance' is an excellent example of this approach.

 
My aim is to make music that you can either listen to in a concentrated way or you can put on in  the home to create a warm, inviting and energised atmosphere, or you can listen to it while you are walking, driving or travelling by plane, bus or train to help to pass the time in a more enjoyable way. A man who bought my last album says he puts it on every morning while his family are eating breakfast as it creates a great mood to start the day.
I strongly feel that world needs to hear this music.
Our precious world is increasingly becoming a frightening and dangerous place and music is needed more than ever to make people feel calm and reassured. For me it is simply not good enough for  my music to simply be a manifestation of a chaotic world. However this is not 'new age' or background music; this is music of great power and energy. I am a performing musician of 37 years experience and I have played at many of the world's major jazz festivals and jazz clubs, so I am highly experienced in creating music to connect with and energise audiences. 
I purposefully create music with the aim of completely engaging the listener, drawing them in with beautiful sounds, compelling rhythms and melodies that will capture and retain their attention, so they can forget about their problems for a while, think clearly about life and gather their strength to move their life forward in the best possible way.
The risks and challenges are as follows; there is always the risk that an artist will not complete a project. However, this project is now at a very advanced stage; I estimate that 70% of the work has been done. I also have a flawless track record of finishing projects with eight albums to my credit, most of them self-produced, so there is no risk of the album not being completed.
The challenges also are largely completed; the main challenges are writing and rehearsing the music, booking the musicians and recording followed by the practicalities of artwork,  distribution, disc pressing and promotion. So far I have got to the stage of having done the great majority of the recording, with only a couple of days recording remaining to finish off, and as far as the rest of the challenges in completing the album, as I have stated before, I have a great deal of experience and have total confidence in myself to bring it to completion. The only thing I don't have is the necessary extra money to cover the remaining costs.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Newark, NJ’s hometown girl, Shariese Katrell, has been singing since the age of six. Music has always been very important and has helped her through many difficult times including bouts with epilepsy. Shariese’s condition was diagnosed a year after high school. From then on life started to change. For over 5 years she has been an Anita Kaufmann Foundation Epilepsy Awareness Ambassador. As an ambassador she has assisted the Foundation and Universities across NJ about Epilepsy and other hidden disabilities. She has used music to help her fight through having brain surgery and overcome the many challenges that life presents while living with epilepsy.  This cause is important to Shariese Katrell as an advocate and a person living with epilepsy to share creative avenues of music with the world and convey that epilepsy has a voice and those living with this hidden disability have their own individual stories. </p>
<p>Through the contribution and support of others, educational and physical materials to promote epilepsy awareness can be obtained and shared with the community and more importantly, the world! In addition, your donations can help obtain professional musicians from other states together to participate musically to complete an inspirational song, engineers, producers, and promotion.</p>
<p>Some donations will be utilized for an inspirational epilepsy awareness video once the song is completed; as well as assist with hiring Graphic designers and photographers. In addition, donations will be used to secure a live venue in order to reach the public so those with and without epilepsy can enjoy a live release of the song together and be educated and entertained.</p>
<p>Donations are needed to promote the song which will be available on iTunes, Amazon, Spotify, and other music outlets which will allow contributors to see the result of their donation and all proceeds from the song will go to the Anita Kaufmann Foundation.</p>
<p>It is with great hope that this campaign will shine a valuable light on the hidden disability of epilepsy and the challenges that a person living with the disability as well as their families face on a everyday basis. Epilepsy is a disability that not too many people are aware of and this in itself poses a great challenge in educating the public. In addition, there is not enough media outlets that we see today that promote Epilepsy awareness and Purple Day (March 26th).</p>
<p>Even if you are not able to physically donate monetary contributions, we welcome your support in other ways such as: volunteering, sharing information through social media outlets, like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Snapchat, as well as the Indiegogo link featured.</p>

From a very young age, I already said that I wanted to be a singer. Nobody gave me the support I needed because the thought of that time was that being a singer was not profitable or a profession. I became a publicist, and with that job, I financed my career in music. Studying singing was, always, one of my most consistent activities to this day. My first album was manufactured thanks to the sale of 120 Christmas cakes I made. And when that album obtained the Nominantion to the National Prize of the Artist as ""Musical Revelation of the year"", I ratified that the music was my way. Since then, from the sale of one album I have been financing the next one. But times have changed a lot for the Venezuelan people; and it´s time for me to ask again for your generous help. We must never stop fighting for our dreams, so I invite you to join mine, which has always been genuine and beautiful. This way, I will be able to continue sharing the music and awaken the love in many people, something that is so needed in the world.</p></div><div>
<p>Maybe You can´t contribute, but that doesn't mean that you can't help: please, share this message with your friends and use the Indiegogo share tools, and invite them to join my cause!</p>

</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We need approximately 800 EUR fee for musicians.</li>
<li>One ticket price is 10 EUR, 3 EUR for pupils and students.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>The LUTEDUO</strong></h2>
<p>Anna and Anton have come together to attract attention to the long neglected duo repertoire for the Baroque lute duo. United by a mutual fascination they wanted to help shed light upon music which was written during the final twilight hours of the lute’s bright history. They were the first to perform and record the recently discovered duet compositions of Francois du Fault and transcriptions of the Marin Marais’ duet viola da gamba compositions for two baroque lutes. This resulted in a program «Baroque Lute Duets” which was released on CD in 2002. Later they started to work on duo repertoire for other combinations of historical plucked instruments, especially baroque guitar and theorbo. Showcasing the contrasting styles of different cultures, the program “Baroque Insight” moves us from solemn music of great Italian lute and theorbo players (Allessandro Piccinini and Girolamo Kapsberger) to the temperamental style of the first Spanish guitar virtuosi (Gaspar Sanz and Santiago de Murcia) and melancholic mood of French baroque masters (R. de Visée and F. Couperin). Vast project dedicated to works of Johann Sebastian Bach covers solo works for lute including lute versions of solo violin and cello compositions as well as transcriptions of other instrumental works of the master for two 24 string Baroque lutes.</p>
<p>Recent activity of the duo concerns also 19th century music for romantic guitar. Using copies of 6 string guitars of the 19th century maker Rene Lete, strung with gut strings, the musicians perform works of J.K.Mertz, F. Sor, F. Chopin, Napoleon Coste. The high point of this program is the transcription of the famous organ work by Cesar Frank, Prelude Fugue &amp; Variation, op.18</p>
<p>Anna and Anton successfully presented these programs across Europe performing in Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, The Netherlands, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Russian Federation, Slovakia, Ukraine, and Switzerland.</p>

I'm Dom Palombi, a freelance professional Drummer/Musician, Composer, Arranger, and Twitch Streamer based out of NJ. I'm very excited to share I've been working on my 2nd album to date entitled <i><strong>""Game Night""</strong></i>, a Video Game Music focused collection of Covers and Originals featuring a Super Group of the best musicians in the Video Game Music Community! Before I get into why I decided to pursue this project, I'd to give you some context on how the past 3-4 years of my life have transpired.</p><p> </p><p>Back in 2017, after graduating college with a music degree, I was pursuing multiple musical endeavors. Between working on musical projects, performances/gigs, and other freelance work, in my spare time I've been hanging out with a close friend group that were really into tabletop and video games. As the friend group continued to hang out more frequently, I learned at the time they traveled to a Gaming Convention up in Boston, Massachusetts called PAX EAST. Not knowing about said convention, I figured it would be a fun experience to get away from reality for a 4 day weekend, and see something new.</p><p> </p><p>In the midst of attending said convention, I got the opportunity to experience (what would be) my entry and knowledge of Video Game Music as a primary focus. There were a multitude of musicians and bands performing music from video games at the convention, and it blew my mind. After this first experience, and having no expectation of it happening, I proceeded to venture to more gaming conventions/performances, connected with a VGM band called ""The Super Soul Bros"", and spent sometime hanging out with these guys in San Jose shortly after. We streamed on their twitch channel, which introduced me into the VGM community online, I felt even more inspired to learn more about VGM, and started streaming Drumming/Music on Twitch on August 13th, 2018.</p><p> </p><p>As time progressed, not only did I meet more passionate musicians and others that loved this music, I also got the opportunity to perform with other groups at other conventions and see why this music in particular was so nostalgic and special. It was at that point I developed a new love for VGM, and decided that my next project would eventually be <i><strong>""Game Night.""</strong></i></p><p> </p><p>One of the biggest challenges of this album has been doing everything completely remote. Due to the effect Covid-19 has caused on all of us, musicians alike haven’t had the chances to play live regularly and/or record/rehearse/perform as our lives used to be. </p><p>Due to the causes of the pandemic, more people staying home equaled a large surplus of streamers online. After streaming on twitch for over 2 years, there was a lack of copyright-free resources available to streamers, content creators, and others. Copyright companies started to make thousands of DMCA claims to streamers online, making it harder to use everyday music in the background of their streams. Experiencing this 2nd hand, I purposely wanted to make sure <i><strong>this album would be a safe tool for streamers, YouTube creators, and anyone else that is looking for copyright-free music.</strong></i></p><p> </p><p>At that period of time of adaptation, I wanted to take advantage of the time while everyone was home, and make the most out of the freedom that we’d have during this past year of quarantine to make something truly special.</p><p>Now to make a project like this possible takes a lot of time, planning, producing, recording, mixing/mastering, and much more. It's also not cheap to produce a project like this, especially involving 16 Musicians (including myself), hiring an artist for all of the album artwork/logos/branding, hiring a video editor to produce professional quality music videos to go out to social media, and everything else you don't see happening behind the scenes. Game nights are all about community, and without this amazing community of musicians, gamers and folks like you, a project like this would not be possible.<i><strong>Here's a price breakdown of all of the expenses necessary to bring this to fruition:</strong></i></p><ul>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Barley has been working hard in Southern California for the last 10 years with well over 1000 live shows and 3 albums.  When the creative juices flow it's time to put pen to paper and record our hopes and dreams for distribution to our fans and friends.  We have the opportunity to record at the amazing Brotheryn Studios and master at Capital Records.  While it's not an inexpensive endeavor, this will be our first time in a studio of this caliber, recording the entire album in one weekend from start to finish.  We want to make this the best Barley album we've ever done and the songs we've written support that.  As many shows as we've played we don't charge a cover, so we are looking to you now for a contribution, big or small, to keep the music alive.  We are asking you to consider helping us fund this next chapter in the Barley life.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This album will cost $10,000, nearly half of what a boot strapping studio album normally costs.  We feel we have streamlined the process in our experiences by working through all of the parts in the studio at one time versus piecing things together over time.  We plan to get in, work hard, and walk out with a finished recorded product.  From there we can add any finishing touches, mix it, master it, and show it to the world.</p>
<p>We have some great perks of course which include the album, apparel, private shows, a VIP listening experience, and exclusive membership into the Project Barley Mug Club.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We routinely see the joy our band brings to people at our shows.  This is what continues to make our family (a.k.a. band) work so hard to set up shows, write new music, and create an atmosphere that is fun and enjoyable for all ages.  We are inspired and flattered by the support that we have gained as we continue down our path as a family.  We are very proud of our new songs and you will hear a lot of references to things you may know very well:</p>
<p>""On a South Bay, saltwater day, life is beautiful again""</p>
<p>""We are alive, on The Strand cruising, waves of Sunshine""</p>
<p>""We will sing a song to everyone that still plays the music loud, dance and shout""</p>
<p>""Good friends are what we are, seasoned and battle scarred""</p>
<p>""These Batman Underoos, check out my Super Hero moves""</p>
<p>""Those Regerbombs are made for jail""</p>
<p>""Sunshine on the weekends, cold beer and good friends""</p>
<p>Just a few lines that have taken inspiration from our friends, family, experiences, and locale. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We know this is a huge ask from you and it doesn't come without it's challenges.  There is no risk in getting this project done, but the process is pretty intense and we will need to bring our ""A"" game.  We have been rehearsing in our practice space for 6+ months and have been sprinkling in some of the songs at live shows.  We know that we need to get in the studio and nail it in one or two takes in order to get through the process as intended.  We knew going in to this album that we needed to work incredibly hard to streamline this process to cut production time and money down.  In addition to our jobs, families, activities, and many, many shows, we have done just that.  We can't wait to show you our hard work!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We know that not everyone is in a financial position to contribute to this campaign, but you can support in other ways.  Please help us get the word out and share via email, text, social media, and anything other new thing the kids may be using :)</p>

We routinely see the joy our band brings to people at our shows.  This is what continues to make our family (a.k.a. band) work so hard to set up shows, write new music, and create an atmosphere that is fun and enjoyable for all ages.  We are inspired and flattered by the support that we have gained as we continue down our path as a family.  We are very proud of our new songs and you will hear a lot of references to things you may know very well:
""On a South Bay, saltwater day, life is beautiful again""
""We are alive, on The Strand cruising, waves of Sunshine""
""We will sing a song to everyone that still plays the music loud, dance and shout""
""Good friends are what we are, seasoned and battle scarred""
""These Batman Underoos, check out my Super Hero moves""
""Those Regerbombs are made for jail""
""Sunshine on the weekends, cold beer and good friends""
Just a few lines that have taken inspiration from our friends, family, experiences, and locale. 

Risks & Challenges
We know this is a huge ask from you and it doesn't come without it's challenges.  There is no risk in getting this project done, but the process is pretty intense and we will need to bring our ""A"" game.  We have been rehearsing in our practice space for 6+ months and have been sprinkling in some of the songs at live shows.  We know that we need to get in the studio and nail it in one or two takes in order to get through the process as intended.  We knew going in to this album that we needed to work incredibly hard to streamline this process to cut production time and money down.  In addition to our jobs, families, activities, and many, many shows, we have done just that.  We can't wait to show you our hard work!

Other Ways You Can Help
We know that not everyone is in a financial position to contribute to this campaign, but you can support in other ways.  Please help us get the word out and share via email, text, social media, and anything other new thing the kids may be using :)",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><br/>Hi friends! We're in the studio putting together our first full-length album. We're raising money to help with recording, mixing, mastering, and distribution expenses. We want to make the best sounding album we can give you!!<br/><br/><br/>Music brings people together in a world where so much is divided. Nothing makes us happier than writing and playing music together. It's our dream come true to make an album that sounds as beautiful as this one will. A full-length album is an incredibly unique and powerful art form that can take the listener on a journey through life's emotions. These songs are the result of passion, love, and integrity and we want to give them the recording quality they deserve. We've all spent our lives idolizing bands and wanting to follow in their footsteps. We are so grateful for your support! It means the world to us<br/><br/><br/><br/>We're a psychedelic progressive pop-rock band based in Bellingham, WA, made up of four dedicated and passionate members: vocalist, keyboardist, and guitarist Carly Gilliland, vocalist and guitarist Connor Kelly, drummer Bobby Pelkey, and bassist Joseph Vacca. Like a fresh kiwi, our music is vibrant, sweet, and satisfying. We blend groove-centric jams with sensual vocals, funky bass lines, tasteful drumming, and an exploration of atmospheric guitar tones. Our influences are vast: Pond, The Beatles, Explosions in the Sky, Pink Floyd, Radiohead, Tame Impala, Led Zeppelin, The Strokes, Talking Heads, David Bowie, and Tears For Fears. We jammed for the first time in late 2018, and a few months later Smooth Kiwi was born. <br/><br/><strong>Give our first demo a listen as you continue reading!</strong></p>

I’ve been releasing albums for 10 + years and collaborating with some pretty special people, Devin Townsend, Morgan Agren, Gord Downie and Bob Rock to drop a few names ;) Collaborating and creating with these people has inspired me to take chances and opened my eyes to the real potential of my music. Now, I’ve decided is the time, so I’m embarking on my most ambitious project to date!</p><h3>About 'The Crowned' </h3><p>A few years ago I started writing and recording with Bob Rock after a mutual friend introduced us at the Warehouse studios in Vancouver. Just for fun, we started demo swapping and idea sharing, bonding over a deep rooted passion for meaningful songwriting and production. We had no clear goal in sight, it was just fun. In my life, that’s how all of my meaningful musical partnerships have started. It was through working with Bob I truly came into my own. I grew as a songwriter and a producer and I stopped holding back and after a couple months, it was obvious that these songs were special and needed to be heard. It was then that we started to make plans for my next album, The Crowned.  </p><p>We were at the halfway mark when Covid-19 struck and we put everything on hold. With Bob living in Hawaii and myself held up in Vancouver all we could do was wait, but now, with the world opening up again, we’re set to finish the record and get it out there! </p><h3>What You'll Get</h3><p>As a self funded indie artist I rely on platforms like this to help fund the creation and the promotion of all my releases. So, I’ve come up with a plan and its my hope you will join me in making it happen! </p><p>Over the past few months, I’ve been creating a bunch of amazing content to help fund the finishing up of this record. With this indiegogo campaign I’ll be selling tickets to the following, paired up with other goodies to make it all worth your while. The goodies are:</p><p><strong>A Woodland Performance</strong>: A month ago I ventured into the deep forests of British Columbia with Aaron Nathanson and Samuel Chadwick to film an intimate and serene performance of 4 of the new tracks from “The Crowned”.  </p><p><strong>An Advanced Screening of the 'Blood Red Son' Music Video:</strong> I just finished filming a music video for the first single from The Crowned entitled “Blood Red Son”, and in no word of a lie, it is the most intense and beautiful visual project I’ve never been a part of. It marries my love of old horror films and David Lynch style filmmaking and I cannot wait until it’s out it the world. I’ll be offering ticket holders a sneak peak stream of that before it's release into the world! </p><p><b>'The Crowned' Streamed Performance: </b>Watch a streamed performance featuring new material from The Crowned as well as tracks from my previous records. Played with a full band and featuring studio quality production and lighting design, this will be the first time many of these tracks have even been heard. </p><p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">On top of all that, there’s also a bunch of other goodies like: handwritten lyric sheets, new t-shirt merchandise designs, posters and everything you’d expect of a crowdfunding campaign. </span></p><h3>What I Need</h3><h3><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;letter-spacing: 0px;"">In the spirit of full transparency, here’s the break down of the costs associated with the making and breaking this record:</span></h3><p><strong>New Album ‘The Crowned” - $10,000</strong></p><p>To finish the record we need to raise 10,000 for studio time, musicians, mixing and mastering. Bob and I have already finished 5 tracks but had to put our project on hold due to Covid 19. There are still 8 more tracks currently in the demo stage, to go that are eagerly awaiting the attention the first 5 tracks received.</p><p><strong>Promotion of ‘The Crowned’ - $12,000</strong></p><p>Long gone are the days where I quietly put out an album. I’m so proud of what I am achieving with this record. It needs to be heard. I want to perform it in every city around the world. We have 2 publicists on standby. One in North America and one in Europe/UK, and they will be servicing the album, along with all of the accompanying music videos, to all levels of traditional + online/digital media.  They will work hard at setting up single/video premieres, advance album streams, album reviews, press, interviews, etc. in order to help expose this album to a broader audience. </p><p><strong>Music video for the second single - $10,000</strong></p><p>As I learned last week through shooting the music video for the first single “Blood Red Son”, if you want to do it right, if you want to make something stunning, you’re going to end up spending a lot more than you initially thought you would but in the end it’s worth it. Cinematographer Aaron Nathanson and I just finished shooting a twin peaks-esq horror movie style music video that I am so incredibly excited to share with you. It was an immense amount of work. Throughout the process I wore many many hats and learned so much. Costume designer, Set decorator, Writer, Actor, Producer, Crew, holy fuck I did it all, and I did it with a team of amazing, talented, lovely people who believed in the project. It really does take a village.  </p><p><strong>Streamed Full Band Performance - $4000</strong></p><p>As I’ve said, I want to tour as much as possible as soon as possible. Prior to Covid 19, I was well on my way to doing just that. It started with Devin Townsend’s 2019/2020 European and North American Empath tours where I sang and played guitar. What an incredible experience that was. It really lit a fire under my ass. Through it, I started to receive offers of other tours for my solo work which was amazing. It was everything I’d ever wanted. Then, the world as we knew it ended and so did all of those tours. This livestream aims to both promote the new album and entertain you lovely folks but also show booking agents what I have to offer. Where I fit sonically in the musical world. </p><p>I want you guys to feel like you’re getting as much bang for your buck but more importantly, I want you all to feel like you’re a part of this album, and it’s success. It’s been a long road and all of you have been on it with me every step of the way, I literally could not have got this far without you, your support of my quarantine EP allowed me to survive as an artist throughout the pandemic, I believe we can do this too!</p><h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The Impact</span></h3><p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;letter-spacing: 0px;"">These tracks show a side of me you’ve never seen before, too cautious to share in the past. This album represents strength, power and vulnerability. It also represents drive and focus. I am driven to be heard, to be seen and to perform more so than I ever have. The pandemic showed me what a life without live music would be like and I gotta tell you, I’m not a fan. With this album I aim to tour globally, create beautiful and affecting visuals to accompany these songs and to reach the ears of those who have yet to discover me.</span></p><p>So thats the plan! As you can see, the above numbers add up to an exorbitant amount of cash, maybe we won’t get all the way, although, wouldn’t it be rad if we did? Its a stretch but who knows, I believe in us! :)</p><p>Finally, thank you, for everything. For reading this far, for your continued support though all of my projects to date and for your belief in me. I’m here because of you. You keep me full of hope and inspiration and I’d like to return the favour by creating beautiful music and exceeding your wildest expectations whatever they may be :)</p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><i>Thank you!</i></h3><p>*Indiegogo doesn't accept paypal but i do!

It’s been a long road and all of you have been on it with me every step of the way, I literally could not have got this far without you, your support of my quarantine EP allowed me to survive as an artist throughout the pandemic, I believe we can do this too!The ImpactThese tracks show a side of me you’ve never seen before, too cautious to share in the past. This album represents strength, power and vulnerability. It also represents drive and focus. I am driven to be heard, to be seen and to perform more so than I ever have. The pandemic showed me what a life without live music would be like and I gotta tell you, I’m not a fan. With this album I aim to tour globally, create beautiful and affecting visuals to accompany these songs and to reach the ears of those who have yet to discover me.So thats the plan! As you can see, the above numbers add up to an exorbitant amount of cash, maybe we won’t get all the way, although, wouldn’t it be rad if we did? Its a stretch but who knows, I believe in us! :)Finally, thank you, for everything. For reading this far, for your continued support though all of my projects to date and for your belief in me. I’m here because of you. You keep me full of hope and inspiration and I’d like to return the favour by creating beautiful music and exceeding your wildest expectations whatever they may be :)Thank you!*Indiegogo doesn't accept paypal but i do!

I have travelled the world with my music and my passion to sing started as a young girl, raised on my father's love of the blues and educated by his record collection. I have been blessed to see many new places, sing with many incredible people and meet so many wonderful fans over the years. Now, I ask for your help in making a dream come true. After 9 years with record labels I had to step back this year and take a break. Although I was grateful for everything my past labels had done for me, I could see my love of music changing. My desire to create was being affected by this machine we call the ""music business"" and even my health was being affected by the stress I had endured working with labels while still trying to remain true to myself and my creative spirit. I knew I wanted to go back to a simpler, more pure method of creating and writing and recording. My first 5 albums were made independently before I signed to my first label, and I knew that I was ready again to release my next album independently, only this time bringing with me all the tools and talents I had learned over the years.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1527767803/t2ul5ioo9rzzf16ekbbe.jpg"" src=""""/><br/>Photo of Layla with her father.<br/><br/>My concept was to make an album I had dreamed of making for years, the ""Gemini"" album, a double album of electric and acoustic songs reflecting my own 2 sides musically, spiritually and astrologically. I had discussed this concept with one of my previous labels but the timing wasn't right, but now I knew it was the perfect time to start this concept album as I stepped out on my own to create something independently. I started writing for this album with my guitarist Jan Laacks (who is also a gemini!) in 2017, and together we wrote over 30 songs together. We have chosen our favourite 20 tracks for this very special project which features tones of blues, rock, and folk to showcase the genres I love so deeply and to demonstrate the power and fragility of my voice. And after months of pre-production on the new songs, it is now finally time to start the crowdfunding campaign to raise the money we need to finish this album so we can share it with all of you! With your help we will have the funds to pay for the studio production, recording, mixing and mastering of the album, the CD graphics and design, and manufacturing of the album!<br/> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1527768004/nmkdpszprpbqwr9cmus2.jpg"" src=""""/><br/>Photo c/o Jacques Clérin.<br/><br/>After researching many other artist campaigns I saw that many also asked for extra money to help with promotion. But I have decided after much consideration that I will choose only to ask for the most basic costs that I need right now to finish recording and to release the album. I will spend the time later once the album is manufactured to mail out hundreds of copies to radio and journalists myself once the album is pressed and let this album speak for itself. I want to release it in the most true ""grass roots"" way and tour the album in as many countries as possible to promote the songs live on stage. But I also believe in the power of ""word of mouth"" and have seen how the spirit of one fan who loves an album can help to spread the word to a ""village"" of other music lovers. I believe in my fans, I believe in this album, I believe in what my guitarist and I have created together on this project and I am so excited to take this next step together with all of you, to make this album a reality.  I will run this crowdfunding campaign for 30 days, and every penny received will help us to get closer to the goal of releasing the ""Gemini"" double album this fall. Your help, your belief, your passion and your financial support is the only way I can make this record and it means everything to me that I have had you all by my side for so many years through the ups, the downs, and every moment in between.

<h3>***Updated Goal***</h3>
<p>Thanks to you we met our initial goal for the new album in less than 48 hours! We’ve decided if we can raise a little extra we’ll be able to re-record some old songs and release them this fall, before the new record comes out. Any extra funds will go towards music videos and the merchandise line. We’ve also added a few new perks so be sure to check those out.</p>
<p>$10,000 - Recording, Mixing &amp; Producing</p>
<p>$4,200 - Mastering </p>
<p>$5,800 - Distribution of CDs &amp; Vinyl</p>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hey there! We're Nick and Tyler Talbott, two brothers who grew up writing songs together, running each other over with dirt bikes and leaving our hometown in Nebraska to start a music career in the Pacific Northwest. We've spent the past 6 years touring the world, meeting new friends and making records. Now it's time to make another one and we're inviting you to be a part of it. This past year has looked a lot different for everyone, not just musicians. We've been reminded that building a strong community and being a part of one another's journey is essential, no matter what you're doing. To make a positive difference, we simply cannot do this alone. In order to be more effective and bridge the gap from 2020 to 2021, we've decided to invite you on board and set our goal for $35,000 in 30 days.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Since our last album, Ghost Talker (featured by Rolling Stone and Billboard), was released in 2019 we've been working on writing new music, some of which will be released as singles ahead of the full-length album. In the past we've relied heavily on income from touring to help fund our projects and team. When venues shut down in March of 2020 our plans for the album were pushed back, but we continued to write music and collaborate remotely with our friend and producer, Justin Abel. The time we spent at home resulted in sound exploration, challenging our own perspectives and letters turned into songs. In order to finish bringing this record to life we need to cover some expenses. Our goal is to get this project finished as soon as possible so we take it out on the road. Here is a breakdown of the costs:</p>
<p>$10,000 - Recording, Mixing &amp; Producing</p>
<p>$4,200 - Mastering</p>

<h3>Partner with Whitney to Launch Her Debut Album!</h3>
<p>Hi, I’m Whitney! I’m a Catholic recording artist and church organist, and I am so excited to bring you my first full-length album. Over the past few years, I have been sharing sacred music with my audiences online through YouTube and social media, and I am so excited to finally be launching this album!</p>
<p>For centuries, the Faith has been kept alive by passing hymns down from one generation to the next, and now I want to share some of these special hymns with you. Music is how I come to know God, and I believe that now, more than ever, we need to be strong and keep the Faith. My biggest hope for this album is that it will help to spread the Gospel and bring others to know Christ!</p>
<h3><strong>The Album</strong></h3>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1630352060/o8i8lbu2b53dcp5sf2lt.png"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p>I am so proud of this album. It features 10 of my favorite hymns that I hope will inspire you and strengthen your faith. With so many forces of darkness working against us in the world today, I believe that that sacred music is one of the best weapons we have in our arsenal. Not only will it help you to learn more about your faith and bring you closer to God, but I hope it will be a force of goodness and beauty against the forces of darkness.</p>

<h3><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></h3>
<p>Creating my first album hasn’t been without its risks. Since I’ve never done this before, it has been a learning process. To be perfectly honest with you, doing this campaign is scary! For one, if I don’t reach my goal, my album release will be delayed. But also, it’s hard to jump in and do this crowdfunding campaign when it is all so new to me and the learning curve is steep. Doing this campaign is way out of my comfort zone, but it is 100% worth it to be able to share this music to you.</p>
<p>I have been working on this album for almost a year and it has been hard work. Most of the time spent working on it was late at night after I put my kids to bed. I believe that anything worthwhile is worth working for, and that has been my motto with this album! Honestly, as a busy, homeschooling mom, I never could have dreamed of getting even this far. I have worked hard, but I give all the credit to Jesus Christ for being my strength,</p>

Hi, I’m Whitney! I’m a Catholic recording artist and church organist, and I am so excited to bring you my first full-length album. Over the past few years, I have been sharing sacred music with my audiences online through YouTube and social media, and I am so excited to finally be launching this album!
For centuries, the Faith has been kept alive by passing hymns down from one generation to the next, and now I want to share some of these special hymns with you. Music is how I come to know God, and I believe that now, more than ever, we need to be strong and keep the Faith. My biggest hope for this album is that it will help to spread the Gospel and bring others to know Christ!

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We need at least $3,000 to do this music video right using our native equipment. Ideally though, we wish to raise $10,000 so we can hire a crew with even BETTER professional equipment to take the visuals to the next level. So long as we raise at least $3,000 though, we will make the music video as that's the minimum this campaign needs to be released to us.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">To thank you for helping us get there, we have some AMAZING ways for you to get involved and be rewarded, including:</span></strong></p>

<h2><b>MINIMUM GOAL REACHED - WHAT'S NEXT</b></h2>
<p>As we have hit our minimum goal, what we are on the path for now is trying to reach 10K so we can hire a full-service production crew with better equipment than what we have to shoot with.</p>
<p>That said, even before hitting 10K, we still need funds to improve the production with additional:</p>
<h3><strong>- Props</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>- Actors</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>- Filming effects/equipment</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>- Sets</strong></h3>
<p>So even if we don't hit 10K, your support past the minimum helps us move beyond inferencing shots (that is, shots that imply content but cannot show more due to budget constraints) to being able to have dynamic scenes with more believable props, actors, and set support.</p>
<p>It's going to make the music video both more engaging and hard-hitting with the social commentary we want to portray.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>In times of change and uncertainty, music can be a comfort, aid understanding and be a call for action. This project is the seed from which this music will grow, providing a social commentary and encouraging hope through small changes.</p>
<p>We (Laura-Beth Salter &amp; Ali Hutton) formed our duo about five years ago as a focus to develop something new. From very different musical upbringings, From the Ground is a celebration of the music that we share, and the common ground found between us. It is the roots of our musical exploration into the world around us which is influenced by current issues surrounding the human effect on climate change, health and wellbeing and freedom of movement. This recording aims to highlight social and environmental concerns and promote change for good.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are incredibly grateful to Creative Scotland for backing this project, however, in order for us to complete the project we still need some help. This is where you come in!</li>
<li>We are offering signed CD pre-orders which you will receive before the album is released, and a whole host of specialised items. </li>
<li>If you choose to back us by purchasing one of our perks, the money will go towards helping us create an immersive experience for you, our audience. Snippets of the field recordings that inspired us, top class videography of the environments we are soundscaping and interviews with specialists will be made available to help you feel more connected with the music we are writing.</li>
</ul>
</div><div><h3> </h3></div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We realise that the current pandemic has made it really difficult for people to go about their everyday lives as normal. As professional musicians, we both feel our livelihoods, careers and wider industry are at risk. We know this is the case for many professions just now, and hope for everyone, that this situation improves soon.</p>
<p>One of the large challenges of this project is working remotely and dealing with the restrictions in place in Glasgow. We have always worked on music organically, playing in the same room and for hours, until something feels right. We are now developing new ways of sharing and continuing to work on new music and have gradually fallen into a new rhythm of working. We are determined to maintain the quality of our previous work, if not, to improve upon it.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand that this is a difficult time for many, but would like to let you know that, if you would like to help us without it costing money, you still can.</p>

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">THE WHY</span></h3>
<p>It’s a hard thing to swallow...when circumstances ask that you forget about something you love in order to meet the responsibilities set before you.  All those little (and not so little) deaths we experience in life when we find our time is not our own and we can’t do the things we wish we had the freedom to do.</p>
<p>As a father of 6, you can imagine how little time <i>is</i> my own.  My time belongs to my wife and my kids…and I get a few scraps here and there.  I would not have it any other way though.  I’d give up far more than <i>time</i> for them.  They make my life beautiful.</p>
<p>I get asked often when I’m going to record again.  I get asked all the time if I’m writing.  That second question is easy…always.  I'm always writing.  As for recording, you might as well have asked if I was raising grass-fed unicorns yet.</p>
<p>I’ve realized though, that creating makes me come alive, and I need to <i>make</i> time for that part of me.  But it's much more than that.  As much as art gives life to the artist, its true end and purpose bears an altruistic component.  Art is for others.  In fact, all of life, in the end, finds meaning when given for others.  I want to create music not just because of the life it gives me, but because I want to share that life with you.  Maybe you'll connect with these songs.  Maybe they'll just be a nice background tune to make dinner to.  Maybe your kids will sing along with them in the back of the car on your way to vacation...either way, some level of beauty will have been added to your life, and that thought makes me smile.</p>
<p>It's time to get in the studio and create!  Wanna help?</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I'm a singer-songwriter from Ottawa, Canada and I've been recording music, releasing it, and touring all over the world for over 15 years.  Along the way I’ve released 7 albums, won a few awards, and performed all over Europe and North America.   I released my latest record Just Words in February 2020 and was actually on tour in Europe when the pandemic hit.  I had over 100 album release shows cancelled across Europe and North America in 2020 and we're still not really sure when regular touring will start back up again. <br/><br/>That's the downside.  The upside is I've had some time to learn about recording at home.  And I started collaborating with my good pal and Good Intention Blair Michael Hogan (who was on that fateful tour to Europe in March 2020). We've actually co-written EIGHT of the eleven songs together AND we're going to co-produce the new album together too. We’ve actually already done a lot of the pre-production for the new songs, so we already have a really good idea of what we want the songs to sound like.  We just need to figure out how to pay to do it.  That's where YOU can help!!  #PandaCrew</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We're hoping to raise $10,000!   WOW that sounds like a lot of money.  And it IS because making records is expensive!!  Normally I would pay to make THIS record with the money I made from touring Just Words.  But no touring = no money.  So I’m hoping YOU will play the role of record label and help me to finance this project. <br/><br/>We plan to release the record in March 2022, and in addition to all the cool things listed along the right hand side of this page, Panda Crew members can expect to get an earlier preview of the new music.  Hey they don't call them PERKS for nothing!<br/><br/>This campaign has been set up for Flex Funding which means if I don't reach my goal, I'll still get the money that's raised. That will mean reevaluating some of what I do. But no matter what I'll be putting this album out into the world, however the campaign plays out.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I’ve been a DIY artist for my entire musical career, so I'm used to wearing many hats.  For this album I feel like I’m pushing myself further than I ever have before, both in terms of the actual music that will end up ON the album as well as how we’re approaching making it.  In addition to producing the record, Blair and I will also be doing some of the tracking ourselves at Panda Cave Studios (that’s a fancy title for my home studio).<br/><br/>In order for us to have a finished product that is as good as it can possibly be we DO need to be able to hire the right people to do the things that are just a wee bit above our pay grade! So don't worry I won't be playing drums on the album!  In addition to laying down the groove, Phil Shaw Bova has agreed to mix and master everything we throw at him.  Phil has not only been nominated for Grammy awards for his work, he also has really cool analog gear with a lot of knobs and lights and meters that make songs really freaking good. If you like numbers I've included a budget on how we'd spend that $10,000 below.<br/><br/><strong>STRETCH GOALS:</strong>  If we’re able to exceed our goal of $10,000 to cover the costs of making and manufacturing the album, we'll press vinyl like all the cool kids do.  And after that we'll  promote the new album.  Which is a HUGE part of making sure the music ultimately gets heard.</p>
</div><div><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3></div><div>
<p>If you aren’t in a position to help financially right now but still want to support the making of this album there are other ways you can help out. Spread the word! Tell your family and friends and let them know what's going on.  With all the social networking and ways we now connect with one another, by posting links to this page you are reaching places we would never be able to reach.</p>
<h3>Budget</h3>
<p>Records are expensive to make, even when you do some of the recording yourself. And they are also expensive to promote. So to be completely transparent here's a projected budget we've prepared to give you an idea as to how we've planned to allocate the funds. <br/><br/>Recording  <br/>Additional studio time $1,000<br/>Session Fees:  $2,000<br/>Mixing &amp; Mastering $3,000</p>
<p>Manufacturing<br/>Artwork $1,500<br/>CD manufacturing $1,500<br/><br/>TOTAL to record and manufacture album $9,000<br/><br/>Fundraising GOAL $10,000<br/>Indie GoGo Fees (5%) -$500<br/>Credit Card fees (3%) -$300  <br/>Adjusted gross $9,200</p>
<h3>STRETCH GOALS</h3>
<p>If we EXCEED our target, we still have a LOT of things we'd like to do.  Including pressing VINYL and undertaking a marketing campaign.  So here's what our stretch goal budget would cover if we raise more than that initial milestone of $10,000:<br/><br/>Print vinyl records $3,500<br/>Hire a Publicist $4,500<br/>Undertake singles (3) campaign $3,000<br/>Create professional music videos for each single (3) $7,500<br/><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1626185325/aygynmjhsqxbl9uz3glp.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

This is the intent of Khu.éex', to present a contemporary interpretation of our culture to empower others.</p><p>In March 2016, Khu.éex' entered the studio to simultaneously begin work on what would result in two triple albums:  2019's  “Héen”, and Khu.éex's upcoming new fourth album ""WOOch"".</p><p> </p><h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1610495205/zbn4ph2mabxjfxdsrfsd.jpg"" src=""""/></h3><h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The New Album: WOOch</h3><p>Translating from ""together"" in the Tlingit language, ""wooch"" also echoes the ""WOO"" philosophy of Khu.éex' co-founder, the legendary Bernie Worrell, (keyboardist and original member of Parliament-Funkadelic) in which he wished to use music to bring people together through sound.

Support from our Contributors was fundamental in the production of this new album which is scheduled to be released in June 2021.  Thank you to all of our Contributors so far. We want to extend our original goal by $10,000, for an overall total of $25,000. We will use any funds that go over the original $15,000 goal to get into the studio and add the multi track layering and mixing for a new batch of music recorded in October of 2020.  Khu.éex’ recorded 6 basic tracks for a new EP reflecting the newest line up. These new tracks feature Sondra Segundo our lead singer, singing in her Haida language, ""Killer Whale Song"", and our newest song titled ""Breathe In"". This would also feature Edward Littlefield on drums/vocals and Jason Cressey on Trombone. Please consider contributing to help us reach this next phase.  The Khu.éex’ StoryKhu.éex’ (pronounced koo-eex) translates to “Potlatch” in the Tlingit language, a Native group from Southeast Alaska. Co-Founder Preston Singletary thought of the name Khu.éex' because of the notion of sharing culture, stories, and music. This is the intent of Khu.éex', to present a contemporary interpretation of our culture to empower others.In March 2016, Khu.éex' entered the studio to simultaneously begin work on what would result in two triple albums:  2019's  “Héen”, and Khu.éex's upcoming new fourth album ""WOOch"".  The New Album: WOOchTranslating from ""together"" in the Tlingit language, ""wooch"" also echoes the ""WOO"" philosophy of Khu.éex' co-founder, the legendary Bernie Worrell, (keyboardist and original member of Parliament-Funkadelic) in which he wished to use music to bring people together through sound. Hear the first song, 10,000 Generations,  from this album now at the Khu.éex' Bandcamp page. Focusing on the concept of the Alaska Native communities' shared experiences,  the album explores the connection between historical and contemporary issues and intergenerational strength in the face of trauma. ""WOOch"" also represents Bernie Worrell's final major studio project before his passing 3 months following the beginning if these sessions.  Bernie's playing reflected profound depth and power in the face of his cancer battle. Produced by Randall Dunn (renowned for his work with Sunn O))), Earth, and Jóhann Jóhannsson), ""WOOch"" is Khu.éex's most expansive work yet, ranging stylistically from Funk to Spiritual Jazz to Americana to Drone Metal. “WOOch” features Bernie Worrell (Keyboards), Preston Singletary (Bass), Captain Raab (Guitar), Gene Tagaban (vocals, spoken word, flute), Nahaan (spoken word, vocals), Skerik (Sax and horn arrangements), Hans Teuber (horns, flutes), Stephen Nistor (Drums, percussion), Denny Stern (percussion), Indrayani Ananda and Carly Kienow (vocals), and Tim Kennedy (keyboards). Special featured guests: Qacung (Y’upic vocals) acclaimed singer and co-founder of Pamyua, Eyvind Kang (Viola), and Jay Kardong (pedal steel).  How You Can Help Khu.éex' has reached our goal of $15,000 to complete and release  the new album, ""WOOch"".

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Gareth Jones, the legendary Producer and and Mix Engineer behind many iconic artists such as Depeche Mode, Erasure, Nick Cave and many more has just released his debut album, ""Electrogenetic"". This is Gareth's debut album which is a glimpse into his life, his mind and soul. Having heard this album prior to its release, I was very impressed by the production, passion and sheer attention to detail whilst at the same time I was deeply moved by the themes, atmospheres and emotion in this stunning body of work. This album takes you on a journey and it shows not only the technical genius of one of electronic music's most iconic producers but also the depths of his soul. The album was released digitally and on cassette on the 18th of September 2020 under the Calm &amp; Collect Label. After hearing this incredible album, I felt strongly that it most certainly deserves a vinyl release!!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Under the guise of Exposed Brick I have been recording &amp; releasing electronic music for a number of years, garnering numerous fans &amp; enjoying regular air play (e.g. Chris Currie at Mersey Radio, Artefaktor Radio in Mexico, White Lion Radio (Manchester), In The Moog at NCCR to name just a few). The logical next step is a physical release.</p>
<p>This set of 8 electronic tracks has been almost a year in the making, since the original idea surfaced when re-reading Koestler's ""Darkness At Noon"". There is a thematic consistency to the pieces though I will leave listeners to make the connections. Styles range from minimalist electronica to synthpop; several tracks are instrumental, some have spoken-word &amp; a few have yours truly on vocal duties!</p>
<p>I'm proud of this music, all of which I have composed &amp; recorded solo, &amp; believe that it will be appreciated by many people who may not yet have heard my work.</p>
<p>To commit to a limited run of 200 12"" vinyl EPs involves considerable costs, hence this crowdfunder.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The limited edition (200) EP requires ~£1500 to get off the ground. Costs are the professional mixing &amp; mastering at Satélite Estudios (Oviedo) (already completed) where I have a very reasonable deal with Jorge Otero, for the physical manufacture of the EPs &amp; record sleeves, &amp; shipping. I am not looking to profit financially from this crowdfunder, but rather to recoup the costs &amp; bask in the glorious knowledge that something I have created is sitting proudly in houses in the UK, Spain &amp; beyond, &amp; hopefully getting an occasional spin &amp; providing some joy/entertainment.</p>
<p>You can commit solely to pre-ordering the record. This is obviously a great help.</p>
<p>Or, you can pre-order the record + some delightful experiences/additional products (see perks). This will be even more help!</p>
<p>If I don't reach the full amount I will hopefully still be able to go ahead, using monies raised to pay the studio costs &amp; contribute to the the manufacture, then recouping the rest through sales. And 3 record shops (Dig Vinyl &amp; Collect &amp; Survive in Liverpool, + Alta Fidelidad in Oviedo) have already agreed to stock the EP.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This music deserves a release, &amp; not just as a digital file. It merits a physical existence. All pieces are original &amp; have never before been released. I have dedicated almost a year to composition &amp; recording, painstakingly amending, crafting &amp; improving each track until it sounds as it now does. The artwork has been created by the brilliant Andy Butler. Hence, I can offer a beautiful &amp; unique object. Own it, enjoy it, again &amp; again. Be one of the select 200.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are zero risks to contributors. I fully expect to raise enough to be able to go ahead with the project. If I do not feel able to proceed, I will return all contributions.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you cannot contribute, or even if you can/have, sharing &amp; promoting the project online in order to further raise awareness is obviously immensely helpful. Pop into Dig or Collect &amp; Survive &amp; ask when the EP will drop! Everyone can help in some way - including you!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi! I'm John Muirhead, an indie-folk artist based in Toronto, Canada. </p>
<p>• Over the past four years, I've played my music across the country and have self released three EPs. </p>
<p>• I've shared the stage with some of Canada's best musicians, including <strong>Craig Cardiff</strong>, <strong>Joel Plaskett</strong>, <strong>Arkells</strong>, and many, many more.</p>
<p>• My music has been featured across the country on <strong>CBC</strong>, <strong>SiriusXM</strong>, community radio, and television networks like <strong>Global</strong> and<strong> CTV.</strong></p>
<p>• I've played 200+ shows on moving trains, at folk festivals, in backyards, coffee houses, bars, and living rooms. </p>
<p>• I've worked with some of the best songwriting, performance, and music business mentors in Canada, including <strong>John K Samson, Christine Fellows, Graydon James, Lorraine Lawson, Jadea Kelly, </strong>and more.</p>
<p>•In  2017, I was nominated <strong>Canadian Folk Music Award </strong>​for Young Performer of the Year.</p>
<p>• All the while, I've been writing some of the <strong>best songs I've ever written</strong> and slowly compiling them into my first full-length album! </p>
<p>Along with Toronto-based producer Taylor Lucas, I've been hard at work editing, arranging, and recording these songs to make them as amazing as possible for you. As you know, recording and releasing an album is an expensive investment, and I'd love to have you join in on the process!</p>

<h3>Budget and Financial Goals</h3>
<p>The total budget of this album release is approximately $7500. This includes tracking, mixing, mastering, content creation, and marketing. I plan to raise $2500 from this campaign - the rest will be self-funded, along with pending grant funding.</p>
<p>The funds raised from this campaign will help to pay some of the up-front costs associated with the early stages of the recording process - production costs, session musicians, and album-related merchandise. </p>
<p>Here are some of the costs that independent musicians must consider in the making of a full-length album:</p>
<p><br/>- <strong>Mixing - </strong>the time-consuming process of blending the sounds together cohesively.<br/>- <strong>Mastering</strong> - the final ""cherry on top"" to make the final track sound amazing.<br/>- <strong>Production</strong> - a producer is kind of like an editor - making sure the songs are as strong as possible and the parts within it fit into the bigger picture. These costs also include time at the studio.<br/>- <strong>Collaborators</strong> - paying fair wages to everyone involved (producers, engineers, musicians)<br/>- <strong>Marketing</strong> - Large, yet crucial cost to getting our music to new ears (hiring radio trackers and publishers, digital advertising, showcasing, etc)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>

<h3><u>Long lost Hammerbox songs recently discovered!</u></h3>
<p>For a good part of the early 90s, Hammerbox dominated the NW music scene and seemed ready to take over the world at any moment. They toured the relentlessly (much to the delight of thousands and thousands of fans), released fantastic albums, had songs in movies and video games and without a doubt, left an impression on everyone lucky enough to cross their path.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>While working on the Goodness on vinyl project way back in 2017 (LPR002), we manage to unearth a reel that surprisingly contained a couple of Hammerbox songs that were recorded (obviously) but, never actually saw the light of day. Until now.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Capturing the band's undeniable brilliance right at their beginning in 1990, these songs show just how great the band was from the start. It's rare to get a chance to find recordings like this to share with people and we're so excited to do so.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With your help, we plan on releasing a 2-song 7"" of the previously unreleased Hammerbox songs, Tragic Static and Down In The Hammerbox. PLUS a bonus alternate version of Hammerbox's Under The Moon (that has a lush jazzy feel to it) will be included with the digital download for this release as well.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We've put together some pretty cool campaign perks to help us achieve the funding goal to make this happen, including brand new Hammerbox shirts, hats, test pressings, and even a couple of copies of the band's first 7"" autographed by ALL THE BAND MEMBERS!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you're a fan of the band you won't want to miss out on getting your hands on a copy of this limited edition colored vinyl 7""</p>

I am very proud of this material and happy to share it with you! It takes a lot to make an album and to create an experience around the music with visuals (artwork, videos etc). In this case, financially speaking, it takes much more than what this campaign goal is asking for...</p><p>I am a 100% independent artist and this means I am 100% responsible for managing the entire project, the financing, the creation of the music, the merchandise... everything.</p><p>By pre-ordering an exclusive &amp; limited to this campaign bundle, you become an integral part of this project. Your contribution will help bring this album to the world in 2020!</p><p>Your involvement in making this album a success will also prove that we can make it on our own without middlemen and labels... which... is... awesome! </p><p>Join me on this mythical journey and let’s launch this together! </p><p> </p><h3><strong>~ A bit of a Backstory ~</strong></h3><p>I consider myself an underdog and a dreamer. I couldn't speak English when I was writing lyrics in English, I didn’t receive guidance from my parents as a child to cultivate my music gifts (it's ok.. they didn't know better), I grew up in a household of domestic violence where seeing hurt and pain was normal. I didn't start cultivating my voice until I was old enough to make decisions for myself. I started later in life it seems, but I'm doing this! Will you help me launch my debut album? :)</p><p>Many phenomenal musicians (check them out further below) based in 5 different countries gave their heart and soul to bring this album to life. </p><p> </p><h3><strong>~ The Artwork ~</strong></h3><p>It’s been a couple of years since I immersed myself in ancient Greek mythology. So many characters, so many stories, aaahhh… it’s always such an immersive experience reading it. The imagination can run wild!</p><p>I was influenced so much by the mythology and chose a character that depicts the theme of the album well, that of Medusa. A beautiful maiden who went through hell and paid a heavy price for the sins of others. She and even the sound of her name spread horror and fear after having been metamorphosed into a monster, to nowadays being a symbol of power especially for women all around the world! Many things in our lives get Demythed at some point :)</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1581943316/ymlhi5rlvlyejxi1zcne.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h3><strong>~ The Concept &amp; Title ~</strong></h3><p>The concept for this album is simple: we are all on a unique path, a journey between light and darkness. Balancing life seems impossible at times and even if we lose our way, we have to come back wiser and stronger.</p><p>The title for this album is called ""Demythed"". I wanted to find a word that reflects the concept. Sometimes things aren't as they seem. You can have a specific idea of what a situation would feel like if you lived it, and when you do, it can be completely different to what you expected, right? Demythed seemed the perfect title to me.</p><p>It is a word that symbolises change, rebirth. The word doesn't actually exist. I was watching  an interview with David Bowie, while trying to make up a word with the root ""myth"", and he did it for me! In that interview he said ""<i>demythed</i>""!! And I thought... THIS IS IT! That's the Title! Thaaaaanks David! :)</p><p> </p><h3><strong> ~ The Story &amp; Sound ~</strong></h3><p>Some songs I wrote years ago and some of them recently. Due to this, you’ll find an eclectic mix of sounds on this album which I think makes it fresh and unique. Even though each song has its own character and individuality, they all fit together like a glove.</p><p>With that said, you’ll find ethereal and distorted sounds, elaborate and very simple orchestrations, siren type vocals but raw ones too. Get ready for a mythical journey my friend!</p><p>This album is by far my best work and I haven’t given so much time and effort to anything else in my life! You'll hear it soon enough. Let me know what you think. :)</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1581943585/yvvub9zjl3fbfyjvabdm.jpg"" src=""""/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/> </p><h3>~ DEMYTHED - TRACKLIST ~</h3><p><strong>1.

Nobody Knows</strong></p><p><strong>7. A Little Too Late</strong></p><p><strong>8. Hopes and Dreams</strong></p><p><strong>9. Starry Night</strong></p><p> </p><p>It might surprise you to know that it took 4 and a half years roughly to finish this album with only 9 tracks, but being an independent artist takes a lot and it's taken me everything I’ve got to do this. my energy, my soul, my money... my whole being heh :)</p><p>I hope you'll love this album as much as I have loved birthing it! </p><p> ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><h3><strong>~ Musicians On This Album ~</strong></h3><p><strong>Hellena</strong> - Songwriting, Lyrics, Vocals, Keys, Guitar, Production</p><p>Location: United Kingdom</p><p>I have been a songwriter for a while. I don’t usually wait for creativity to hit me, I look for it. Sometimes though, I am lucky, and the songwriting process can start with a melody that pops into my mind either when I’m asleep, or not. I play around with it on the piano or guitar (I recently started writing on the ukulele too.. yay!) , coming up with the basic chord structure which usually changes in the process. I get into the songwriting process without thinking of the genre of music I am creating. This is probably why my music has been so diverse.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1579952688/cvlgw5ifpnekdntbqims.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><strong>Denis Efimenko</strong> - Production, Arrangement, Guitar, Bass, Keys, Mix, Mastering</p><p>Location: Greece</p><p>Denis is a Genius! We worked on this album together for years and due to this, we grew together throughout the process. I love his input but especially his guitar playing! It is so enchanting and smooth! I close my eyes every time and I am being hypnotised into another realm..</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1578748453/ovednldqrdjxhx095gqy.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><strong>Marco Coti Zelati</strong> - Bass (Lacuna Coil)</p><p>Location: Italy</p><p>This man needs no introductions. He’s so giving and always makes me laugh with his incredible sense of humour… it's very Italian :) I cannot express with words how grateful I am that he took part in this project, and especially on a song that means so much to me as it talks about a serious issue, that of domestic violence, called “A little too late”. I only have 1 complaint. I still haven’t tried his delicious-looking cooking on Instagram! :)</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1579952475/gu6nedejgfc6jraisxgi.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h3><strong>~ More Beautiful Musicians Involved: ~</strong></h3><p><strong>Lef Germenlis</strong>  - Production, Arrangements, Orchestration, Keys (Until Rain)</p><p>Location: United Kingdom</p><p>Is there anything that this guy cannot do? I don’t think so! Apart from being one of the best pianists I know, he is also a beautiful human being and I am so happy he graced us with his time and talent on this album!</p><p> </p><p><strong>Babis Nikou</strong> - Eastern Instruments (Dia Mageias)</p><p>Location: Greece</p><p>Such a talented musician Babis is! 90% of the Eastern instruments you’ll hear on this album were recorded by him! His bouzouki and santouri will take you to other worlds.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Thomas Miller</strong> - Drums &amp; Percussion (Caper Parade)</p><p>Location: United Kingdom</p><p>The drums and percussion Thomas added to this album were incredible. His drumming is classy plus he recorded without a metronome which… well, it takes some skills to do it right...</p><p> </p><p><strong>Tom Mandolini</strong> - Production/Orchestration/Keys</p><p>Location: Switzerland</p><p>It was such a pleasure to work with Tom and totally unexpected too! He emailed me one day with a song of mine he had remixed and I was like: “Dude!...this is great! let’s work together!” I sent him the demo of “Demythed” right after! His strings orchestration is like no other! So incredibly talented and such a nice and humble guy he is. I really hope we will work together again! </p><p> </p><p><strong>Owen Smalley</strong> - Guitar (on Demythed)</p><p>Location: United Kingdom</p><p>Owen arrived last into this music project. He was like the icing on a cake, or the cherry on top. :) His sparse and minimal feel is beautiful and completed the Demythed song. He has such an excellent music taste this guy!</p><p> </p><p><strong>Ethan Bernhardt</strong> - Piano</p><p>Location: United States</p><p>Life is so much better when you work with nice people and Ethan is the nicest ever! I am so lucky to call him my friend, he is a real artist and always up for a new project. When I sent him my ideas for ""Hopes and Dreams"", he just recorded his in absolutely no time. His piano playing is magical and heartbreaking… in a great way :)</p><p> </p><h3><strong>~ Other Contributors ~</strong></h3><p><strong>Guy</strong> - Graphic Artist &amp; Designer<br/>Location: Israel</p><p>Guy has been very patient with me and all of the changes I have been asking him to do.. and they were plenty. :) We have a beautiful understanding between us even though we’ve never met and my collaboration with him taught me that things can work from loooong distance, if there is good chemistry between two people who never met. I consider him a friend already and I'm glad to have him in my team!</p><p> </p><p><strong>Yiannis Katsaris</strong> - Photography</p><p>Location: United Kingdom</p><p>This was the second time I’ve worked with Yiannis as the first one was for “The Parthenon Marbles” artwork cover. He is so easy to work with and I have good memories of us being in the studio. Both times we had a lot of fun. It is so important to have fun while working and Yiannis was definitely the right photographer to work with.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Teresa Fernandez</strong> - Body painting (Ephemeral art)</p><p>Location: United Kingdom</p><p>I found this lovely lady in an endless sea of Google information while looking for a body painter and as soon as we talked on the phone, I just knew she would be my body painter. She is incredible, a sweetheart, punctual and I already miss working with her. sniff.. :(</p><p> </p><p><strong>Mike Partington</strong> - Personal Assistant<br/>Location: United Kingdom</p><p>If it wasn’t for this guy, I don’t know where I would be! He is always...always... Always there! He saved me from a lot of spelling mistakes in English hah... did you think I was fluent in English? No... I am not! ..Mike is! :) and apart from that, he has a big heart and is always 100% committed to our project.

Even though each song has its own character and individuality, they all fit together like a glove.With that said, you’ll find ethereal and distorted sounds, elaborate and very simple orchestrations, siren type vocals but raw ones too. Get ready for a mythical journey my friend!This album is by far my best work and I haven’t given so much time and effort to anything else in my life! You'll hear it soon enough. Let me know what you think. :)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~ DEMYTHED - TRACKLIST ~1. Demythed2. Crazy 3. Birds of a Feather4. Rhythm of Misery5. Powerful Deluge6. Nobody Knows7. A Little Too Late8. Hopes and Dreams9. Starry Night It might surprise you to know that it took 4 and a half years roughly to finish this album with only 9 tracks, but being an independent artist takes a lot and it's taken me everything I’ve got to do this. my energy, my soul, my money... my whole being heh :)I hope you'll love this album as much as I have loved birthing it!  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Musicians On This Album ~Hellena - Songwriting, Lyrics, Vocals, Keys, Guitar, ProductionLocation: United KingdomI have been a songwriter for a while. I don’t usually wait for creativity to hit me, I look for it. Sometimes though, I am lucky, and the songwriting process can start with a melody that pops into my mind either when I’m asleep, or not. I play around with it on the piano or guitar (I recently started writing on the ukulele too.. yay!) , coming up with the basic chord structure which usually changes in the process. I get into the songwriting process without thinking of the genre of music I am creating. This is probably why my music has been so diverse. Denis Efimenko - Production, Arrangement, Guitar, Bass, Keys, Mix, MasteringLocation: GreeceDenis is a Genius! We worked on this album together for years and due to this, we grew together throughout the process. I love his input but especially his guitar playing! It is so enchanting and smooth! I close my eyes every time and I am being hypnotised into another realm.. Marco Coti Zelati - Bass (Lacuna Coil)Location: ItalyThis man needs no introductions. He’s so giving and always makes me laugh with his incredible sense of humour… it's very Italian :) I cannot express with words how grateful I am that he took part in this project, and especially on a song that means so much to me as it talks about a serious issue, that of domestic violence, called “A little too late”. I only have 1 complaint. I still haven’t tried his delicious-looking cooking on Instagram! :) ~ More Beautiful Musicians Involved: ~Lef Germenlis  - Production, Arrangements, Orchestration, Keys (Until Rain)Location: United KingdomIs there anything that this guy cannot do? I don’t think so! Apart from being one of the best pianists I know, he is also a beautiful human being and I am so happy he graced us with his time and talent on this album! Babis Nikou - Eastern Instruments (Dia Mageias)Location: GreeceSuch a talented musician Babis is! 90% of the Eastern instruments you’ll hear on this album were recorded by him! His bouzouki and santouri will take you to other worlds. Thomas Miller - Drums & Percussion (Caper Parade)Location: United KingdomThe drums and percussion Thomas added to this album were incredible. His drumming is classy plus he recorded without a metronome which… well, it takes some skills to do it right... Tom Mandolini - Production/Orchestration/KeysLocation: SwitzerlandIt was such a pleasure to work with Tom and totally unexpected too! He emailed me one day with a song of mine he had remixed and I was like: “Dude!...this is great! let’s work together!” I sent him the demo of “Demythed” right after! His strings orchestration is like no other! So incredibly talented and such a nice and humble guy he is. I really hope we will work together again!  Owen Smalley - Guitar (on Demythed)Location: United KingdomOwen arrived last into this music project. He was like the icing on a cake, or the cherry on top. :) His sparse and minimal feel is beautiful and completed the Demythed song. He has such an excellent music taste this guy! Ethan Bernhardt - PianoLocation: United StatesLife is so much better when you work with nice people and Ethan is the nicest ever! I am so lucky to call him my friend, he is a real artist and always up for a new project. When I sent him my ideas for ""Hopes and Dreams"", he just recorded his in absolutely no time. His piano playing is magical and heartbreaking… in a great way :) ~ Other Contributors ~Guy - Graphic Artist & DesignerLocation: IsraelGuy has been very patient with me and all of the changes I have been asking him to do.. and they were plenty. :) We have a beautiful understanding between us even though we’ve never met and my collaboration with him taught me that things can work from loooong distance, if there is good chemistry between two people who never met. I consider him a friend already and I'm glad to have him in my team! Yiannis Katsaris - PhotographyLocation: United KingdomThis was the second time I’ve worked with Yiannis as the first one was for “The Parthenon Marbles” artwork cover. He is so easy to work with and I have good memories of us being in the studio. Both times we had a lot of fun. It is so important to have fun while working and Yiannis was definitely the right photographer to work with. Teresa Fernandez - Body painting (Ephemeral art)Location: United KingdomI found this lovely lady in an endless sea of Google information while looking for a body painter and as soon as we talked on the phone, I just knew she would be my body painter. She is incredible, a sweetheart, punctual and I already miss working with her. sniff.. :( Mike Partington - Personal AssistantLocation: United KingdomIf it wasn’t for this guy, I don’t know where I would be! He is always...always... Always there! He saved me from a lot of spelling mistakes in English hah... did you think I was fluent in English? No... I am not! ..Mike is! :) and apart from that, he has a big heart and is always 100% committed to our project. Thank you Mike!~ Budget & Behind the Scenes ~Nothing worthwhile is easy.  This album is no different. Even though it takes more than what this campaign goal is asking for in order to create it.. with your help, I can launch this album in 2020! Let’s do this!

<h3>QUI EST FRANCIS?</h3>
<p>Fan inconditionnel des chanteurs populaires québécois, Francis se laisse imprégner par ces grandes voix tout au long de son enfance. Il fait ses débuts très jeune à l’aide d’un système karaoké avec lequel il développe son talent. À l’âge de 13 ans, il participe à son premier concours où il interprète la seule chanson qu’il connaît par coeur. Cet événement lui donne la poussée nécessaire à la poursuite de ses rêves puisqu’il se classe parmi les cinq finalistes. Depuis 10 ans, Francis poursuit sa route et se fait découvrir peu à peu sur la scène musicale.</p>
<p>Finissant du Cégep de St-Hyacinthe en exploration théâtrale et ayant étudié au Cégep de Drummondville en chant pop/jazz, Francis Bédard est un interprète au grand cœur et à la voix puissante et envoûtante. Le nom de Francis Bédard ne tarde à se faire connaître. Son talent toujours grandissant, sa volonté et sa passion le pousseront vers des projets grandioses.</p>
<p>En plus de ses études en théâtre et en chant, Francis a su parfaire son talent par le biais de plusieurs spectacles et concours. Ceci lui a permis d’acquérir une grande expérience sur scène. Il a d’ailleurs remporté plusieurs prix et distinctions dans les dernières années. En 2010, il s’est démarqué plus particulièrement au Concours Bêtes de Scène ainsi qu’au Festival de la chanson Expo-Relève de Saint-Constant. Il a été lauréat et finaliste dans plusieurs autres concours entre 2004 et 2010. Francis faisait également partie de la distribution de l’opéra pop-rock ‘’La vie des anges’’ présenté au Théâtre St-Denis en avril 2012 aux côtés de Marie-Ève Côté (Star Académie). En 2015, on l’aperçoit très ému sur les écrans de millions de québécois lors de son passage à la populaire émission La Voix. Cette aventure lui donnera l'énergie nécessaire à la poursuite de ses rêves! </p>
<p><i>""Ce projet est important pour moi car il m'aidera à réaliser le plus grand rêve de ma vie, celui d'avoir un album à moi et le partager avec vous tous et toutes. Il me permettra enfin de révéler qui je suis, personnellement et artistiquement''</i>.</p>

<h2>NOTRE BUT</h2>
<p>Notre but commun est d'amasser 10 000 $ pour la réalisation complète de mon nouvel album comprenant des chansons originales écrites par mes meilleurs collaborateurs de l'industrie musicale québécoise tels que: Marc-André Sauvageau, Karine Ste-Marie, Mathieu Langevin et Marc-André Bourbonnais (également le réalisateur de mon premier album EP).</p>
</div><div>
<p>10 000 $ c'est beaucoup d'argent... mais 10 000 $ pour la réalisation d'un album, c'est très peu. Normalement, la réalisation et commercialisation complète (album 10 chansons) d'un album coûte entre 30 000 et 50 000 $. </p>
<div>J'ai la chance d'avoir à mes côtés un réalisateur qui croit en mon projet et qui est prêt à investir de son temps dans cet album qui me tient à cœur.  Ce réalisateur de talent travaille actuellement auprès de Bobby Bazini en tant que musicien et a également travaillé sur le projet de l'album éponyme de ma grande amie disparue, Geneviève Breton.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Si par bonheur, j'arrivais à dépasser l'objectif financier actuel,  j'investirai cet argent à la production de d'autres chansons, ainsi qu'à leur commercialisation. De cette façon, mes chansons pourront voyager et toucher le plus de gens possible et ce, grâce à vous! </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Les contreparties personnalisées que je vous offre sont essentiellement de revoir l'album avant tout le monde, d'être mentionné dans la pochette, d'entendre en version ''LIVE'' mes chansons dans votre salon et d'assister en tant qu'invité(e)s VIP à mon lancement d'album. </div>
<div> </div>
</div><div>
<h3>Risques et défis</h3>
<p>Je suis pleinement conscient du risque à vouloir réaliser cette campagne de socio-financement.  10 000 $ c'est beaucoup d'argent, mais c'est également le prix à payer pour réaliser mon rêve de produire et commercialiser un premier VRAI album! Cet album sera le mien et sera aussi beaucoup le vôtre. </p>
<p>Nous pouvons atteindre ce but et relever ce défi. J'en suis certain! </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Quick Summary</h3>
<p>""TIME TO LOVE AGAIN"" will be my 8th CD project (!!) and I'm excited to have recorded it in the birthplace of my career - MIAMI! The musical team that joined me in the studio represent some of the finest musicians in the world, some who I've known for close to 15 years.  </p>
<p>I'd love and appreciate your support of this campaign to help complete the CD-making process, which includes mixing; mastering; art design; manufacturing; and promo.</p>
<p>In my 20-year full-time career, I've been so fortunate to entertain audiences worldwide and earn three TOP 10 jazz albums in the U.S. and Japan.  I pray this album can also reach peoples' hearts internationally.   </p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>What is Needed &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div><div>
<p>The goal is to raise $20,000 of which most would go toward marketing and promotion. We will complete the 'music making' by <i>mixing</i> the tracks and <i>mastering</i> those tracks in the studio. Then comes the CD design and manufacturing. Then all kinds of promotion...from jazz &amp; smooth jazz/adult urban radio, to general PR, to social media, and online advertising. If we are able to raise more than the our goal, we can expand the promo plan in both time and concentration. (I was once told, the average marketing <i>spend</i> is $2 per person you want to impact...wow!)</p>
<p>IN RETURN, campaign participants will ALL receive a FREE digital download of the CD and, depending on your level of participation, additional perks like T-shirts; autographed CDs; CD liner note mentions; associate producer credits and EVEN your own 1-hour acoustic house concert! IN ADDITION, I will post photo and video updates of behind-the-scenes activity! </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Six out of seven of my CDs were self-funded. Though in 2011, my <i>Embraceable</i> CD gained additional support ❤️ through a crowd-funding campaign via ArtistShare. The financial support from that campaign helped pay for promo which helped get that CD to TOP 20 on Jazz Radio and Smooth Jazz Radio Charts! That promo also helped get the single ""Waiting in Vain"" added to the Sirius XM 'Watercolors' station on which it still plays today! Also recently added to that station's playlist was the April 2021 single release ""Feeling Good"" which hails from THIS new CD, <i>Time to Love Again</i>. We hope this is a good sign of more to come...fingers crossed! When music is heard and well-received, it eventually opens more doors to venues and audiences around the world.</p>
<p>So in short - your support of my music will put wind in my wings and help my music soar into the ears of listeners worldwide. Your support helps GREATLY☺️. </p>

<p><strong>COVID-19 UPDATE: </strong>My show has been postponed. However, the recording and plans for this crowdfunding are not cancelled as this show will be rescheduled ASAP!</p>
<p>This year and the last one has been a crazy ride for me. <strong>Beste Zangers</strong>, a <strong>solotour </strong>and of course the upcoming <strong>Nightwish </strong>album and <strong>world tour</strong>! I have always been aware that many people still wanted to see my solo show or were unable to get to see it due to distances or monetary issues.</p>
<p>People are still asking for more shows, but I simply did not have the time to do any more. So what would the alternative be?<strong> A live release! </strong>With this campaign I want to enable everyone to be able to see the full show and get in touch with my music. <strong>This is for you and with you!</strong></p>
<p>With your help I will be able to get the right crew to record the show (video + audio) and the people to process and edit it so you all can see it in all its glory!</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>What Is Needed</strong></h3>
<p>To make this a reality we are going to need a budget of <strong>25.000 euros</strong>. This money will exclusively be used for the production of this release. What you get in return is a digital live release<i> (YouTube and streaming services) </i>for everyone to enjoy (<i>Nightwish fans, Northward fans, new fans</i>)! </p>
<p>I hope to reach this budget but also have a cool plan ready if we’d to go past this goal. Hence the <strong>35.000 euros goal</strong>, which enables us to make an exclusive and professional backstage documentary!</p>
<p>If we happen to achieve this, then <strong>80%</strong> of all extra gained funds will go directly to <strong>World Land Trust</strong>, to support the preservation of our planet through their many unique projects! </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Why No Physical Release?</strong></h3>
<p>Doing a solo tour plus all preparations for an upcoming Nightwish release and world-tour leaves me with little time left to manage other things. And as this release will <strong>not </strong>be supported by a label, it would be impossible for me to spend the needed time and energy to get the right team. The production, shipping, returns and all the things that come with distributing a physical release is simply impossible at this moment. </p>
<p>This is why this is a digital release for you to enjoy on YouTube and streaming platforms!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Perks:</h2>
<p>Only two different perks are available. Both involve your name being seen in the end video credits and on the dedicated web page for the release. As the release will be publicly available, it would feel wrong to charge all of you a lot. This means that all backers who donate 10 euros or more get their name featured. </p>
<p><strong>EDIT: </strong>Personal videos are not available anymore due to overwhelming success.</p>
<h2><strong>What is the plan?</strong></h2>

</div></div>","COVID-19 UPDATE: My show has been postponed. However, the recording and plans for this crowdfunding are not cancelled as this show will be rescheduled ASAP!
This year and the last one has been a crazy ride for me. Beste Zangers, a solotour and of course the upcoming Nightwish album and world tour! I have always been aware that many people still wanted to see my solo show or were unable to get to see it due to distances or monetary issues.
People are still asking for more shows, but I simply did not have the time to do any more. So what would the alternative be? A live release! With this campaign I want to enable everyone to be able to see the full show and get in touch with my music. This is for you and with you!
With your help I will be able to get the right crew to record the show (video + audio) and the people to process and edit it so you all can see it in all its glory!
 


 
What Is Needed
To make this a reality we are going to need a budget of 25.000 euros. This money will exclusively be used for the production of this release. What you get in return is a digital live release (YouTube and streaming services) for everyone to enjoy (Nightwish fans, Northward fans, new fans)! 
I hope to reach this budget but also have a cool plan ready if we’d to go past this goal. Hence the 35.000 euros goal, which enables us to make an exclusive and professional backstage documentary!
If we happen to achieve this, then 80% of all extra gained funds will go directly to World Land Trust, to support the preservation of our planet through their many unique projects! 
 
Why No Physical Release?
Doing a solo tour plus all preparations for an upcoming Nightwish release and world-tour leaves me with little time left to manage other things. And as this release will not be supported by a label, it would be impossible for me to spend the needed time and energy to get the right team. The production, shipping, returns and all the things that come with distributing a physical release is simply impossible at this moment. 
This is why this is a digital release for you to enjoy on YouTube and streaming platforms!
 
Perks:
Only two different perks are available. Both involve your name being seen in the end video credits and on the dedicated web page for the release. As the release will be publicly available, it would feel wrong to charge all of you a lot. This means that all backers who donate 10 euros or more get their name featured. 
EDIT: Personal videos are not available anymore due to overwhelming success.
What is the plan?

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Hollis Webb.  I am a multi-instrumentalist singer/songwriter and producer in San Antonio.  I write and record indie rock music in my home studio in Olmos Park Terrace.  With a little help from my friends, the album I've been working on for the past 6 years is DONE.  </p>
<p>It's D. U. N. </p>
<p>DONE!</p>
<p>The album will be called Rescue.  We just need some help from you to allow us to press it to 12"" vinyl and license the incredible photograph of the submerged polar bear taken by Wildlife Photographer of the Year Joe Bunni.  Let me tell you folks, it is sounding BEAUTIFUL as we are making the final production and mixing touches.  The record is going to sound SO GOOD on vinyl it will be a treat for your ears!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; The Awesome Things You'll Get</h3>
<p>This is a flexible funding campaign.  We must reach our goal of $5000 to master the record especially for vinyl, press vinyl, and then license the photograph for the cover artwork--but even if we don't meet the goal, we will be able to keep what we raise and we will still press CD's and distribute download cards of the record.</p>
<p>&lt;$5000 = CD’s<br/>&gt;$5000 = VINYL AND CD’s WOO-HOO!!!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This will be the LAST album I press to a physical medium.  This is the last album in the trilogy of DANGER INVITES RESCUE as well, so this is especially meaningful to me in many ways.  We are going to do some really fun things for you to get this released.  We'll be talking to a few people who helped make the album and get their thoughts on what it was like to record with me in my home studio.  We'll also be talking to some folks who know a lot about vinyl records.</p>
<p>This is going to be a different kind of crowdfunding adventure.  We are going to have FUN telling you about the record, how we made it, and what is next.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>If we don't make it to $5000, we're not pressing vinyl, but we WILL press CD's,  We've come too far not to get this out into the world.  All the other perks are guaranteed.  Backers will get a download code for the album at EVERY level.  The record is done, we just need you to be our doula to get it out into the world!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am Jordan Ferrin, a California-based jazz musician who has traveled the <i>world.</i>  Now, I am aiming to create an album of music about it with my project, the Jordan Ferrin Storyband.  But, the album will be <i>more </i>than an album, because I want to <i>combine</i> music and travel.  </p>
<p><a href=""https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14heOZOf8mWwR66RQaKTwLMqSMU9xk0iI?usp=sharing"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Here is an example of how that combination will happen.  This travel package is about Dubai. </a> There is a whole story to it, and the live recording, entitled ""Thinking Of Her From Dubai,"" represents the story.</p>
<p>This album will have seven pieces of original music, seven full stories, and many, many, photos.  The idea is to read and know the story first, and then have the music complete the whole story. Jazz music, travel writing, and pictures will come together to give the message of global interconnectedness through understanding, compassion, and brotherhood.</p>

<p>I have seen it all....</p>
<p>This will be an album not just of original music, but original tales--hence the title, <strong>Tales of Transcendence</strong>.  Transcendence is an expansion of normal consciousness through being fully present and concentrated.  You rise above yourself to become a part of something <i>more</i> than yourself.  Transcendence is why this project actually goes beyond me and my experiences.  </p>
<p>I want you and others to know happiness through what I've known.  I want to express how both music <i>and</i> travel not only move us, but guide us the the deepest point within ourselves.  From this point the wisdom of interconnectedness, to everything and everyone, is revealed....  I want to give back to the world what the world gave to me.  Your kindness and generosity will help spread truths that can make the world a better place for us all.  </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order for me and my band to bring this message into the world, I definitely need help.  Money <i>is </i>the biggest challenge, and I simply cannot afford all of this on my own.  That's why I'm asking for help to raise <strong>$4,500.  </strong>This will cover a variety of costs for the album, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>recording</li>
<li>mixing and mastering</li>
<li>producing</li>
<li>album artwork</li>
<li>promotion and marketing</li>
<li>paying my bandmates for their hard, brilliant work!</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Now, for what you will receive: </strong></p>

<p>Every perk's purpose is to connect <i>you </i>to the world in some way.  The album will have seven pieces, and each one has a story--that means everything from captioned photos to entire travel blogs about each piece will be available as perks! </p>
<p><strong>No matter how much you donate, the perks <i>stack.  </i>You'll get ALL the perks below the price of the perk you choose!</strong></p>
<p>And there's <i>more. </i> I bet you have a dream destination--somewhere you've always wanted to go.  Honestly, I've probably <i>been </i>there.  So, I have perks that will cater to <i>your dream destination.  </i>I'll tell you about it, from a summary of my time and recommendations for what to do, to a full, personalized travel blog with <i>all the stories </i>of my time in your dream destination!  </p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>And, that's not all!  For those extremely generous donors, <i>the Jordan Ferrin Storyband will perform for you, too.  </i>If you are here in Southern California, then we can discuss a live performance given Covid-safety concerns.  If you are <i>not </i>in Southern California, then we can certainly do a livestream right to you....</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
I am Jordan Ferrin, a California-based jazz musician who has traveled the world.  Now, I am aiming to create an album of music about it with my project, the Jordan Ferrin Storyband.  But, the album will be more than an album, because I want to combine music and travel.  
Here is an example of how that combination will happen.  This travel package is about Dubai.  There is a whole story to it, and the live recording, entitled ""Thinking Of Her From Dubai,"" represents the story.
This album will have seven pieces of original music, seven full stories, and many, many, photos.  The idea is to read and know the story first, and then have the music complete the whole story. Jazz music, travel writing, and pictures will come together to give the message of global interconnectedness through understanding, compassion, and brotherhood.
 

Edinburgh, Scotland.
 
I worked as a cruise ship musician for over four years.  I did contract after contract, and I went everywhere.  Everywhere.   If you've already traveled to your dream destination, chances are high that I've been there... 
from Singapore:

to Capri:

to Istanbul:

to St. Petersburg:

to New Zealand:

 
I have seen it all....
This will be an album not just of original music, but original tales--hence the title, Tales of Transcendence.  Transcendence is an expansion of normal consciousness through being fully present and concentrated.  You rise above yourself to become a part of something more than yourself.  Transcendence is why this project actually goes beyond me and my experiences.  
I want you and others to know happiness through what I've known.  I want to express how both music and travel not only move us, but guide us the the deepest point within ourselves.  From this point the wisdom of interconnectedness, to everything and everyone, is revealed....  I want to give back to the world what the world gave to me.  Your kindness and generosity will help spread truths that can make the world a better place for us all.  
 


Nice, France.
 
 
What We Need & What You Get
In order for me and my band to bring this message into the world, I definitely need help.  Money is the biggest challenge, and I simply cannot afford all of this on my own.  That's why I'm asking for help to raise $4,500.  This will cover a variety of costs for the album, including:

recording
mixing and mastering
producing
album artwork
promotion and marketing
paying my bandmates for their hard, brilliant work!

 
Now, for what you will receive: 

Every perk's purpose is to connect you to the world in some way.  The album will have seven pieces, and each one has a story--that means everything from captioned photos to entire travel blogs about each piece will be available as perks! 
No matter how much you donate, the perks stack.  You'll get ALL the perks below the price of the perk you choose!
And there's more.  I bet you have a dream destination--somewhere you've always wanted to go.  Honestly, I've probably been there.  So, I have perks that will cater to your dream destination.  I'll tell you about it, from a summary of my time and recommendations for what to do, to a full, personalized travel blog with all the stories of my time in your dream destination!  
 

 
And, that's not all!  For those extremely generous donors, the Jordan Ferrin Storyband will perform for you, too.  If you are here in Southern California, then we can discuss a live performance given Covid-safety concerns.  If you are not in Southern California, then we can certainly do a livestream right to you....
 
NOTE on my photos: 

You'll notice that the quality of my photos varies.  For example, some of them, especially the low-light ones, have tons of grainy noise given high ISO. 

For my first two contracts, I had a pocket camera which produced that grainy noise, and had sub-par megapixels.  Basically, when I started traveling in 2013, I knew nothing about photography gear, nor much of the basics!  All I knew was how to get a good composition for a picture.  Over my years of traveling, I was essentially learning on-the-go!  The most advanced camera I could afford (eventually) was a decent mirrorless, built-in lens that worked quite well.  But however poorly rendered certain photos came out, I took to heart some wisdom from a professional photographer friend on the ship: he said you don't need a great camera if you take great pictures to begin with.  If you are creative and compelling, especially with composition, then you're already halfway there.  

So, do enjoy my variety of different-quality photos, even if they aren't full-frame quality!  I think they still have impact considering the older technology from which they came, and I'm proud of them.  
 

The Impact
Overall, your donations will be honored to bring the music to life.  The perks all come directly from me to you, in all my knowledge and passion for music and travel.  So your donations will not only be honored but made into a deep and personal connection between me and you, through travel, life, and music.   From there, all of us will have contributed to realizing the message of this music-and-travel experience: interconnectedness of all things in this world.

 
Risks & Challenges
It could be likely that we do not reach our goal.  If this happens, then in all honesty, I will find a way to get the album made into a finished product.  It will not have the intended impact, and the time frame for its release would lengthen significantly.  For example, when the campaign raises enough donated funds to pay only for the recording time, I would have to drain most of my savings to get the mixing and mastering done.  I wouldn't be able to pay my bandmates well at all, and PR and marketing (that includes CD printing for the press), and album artwork will have to wait for an indefinite period of time.  
The time is NOW to get this project done for my career; if I have to wait for two or three years, then my career will not benefit.

<h3>About me:</h3>
<p>Hello everyone! My name is Lilli Worona and I am a singer-songwriter and multi instrumentalist based in Central Oregon.  I've been playing music since before grade school and have been lucky enough to play in a variety of different musical groups spanning genres from classical, to rock, to country.  Over the past ten years I have written quite a few original songs, some of which I have performed in local bands and others which I have kept mostly to myself and played only for close friends.  Very little of my original work has been recorded.  Until now!</p>
<p>For obvious reasons, this year has been very different from my usual routine.  I went from playing live almost every weekend to going months without performing.  In an effort to not lose my mind from the lack of music, I set out to revisit and perfect some of my original material that had been gathering dust.  What emerged was some new and improved original works and a unshakable drive to record my first ever original solo album.  This has long been a dream of mine, but has never come to fruition because of my busy performance schedule and work demands.  I've decided that 2021 will be the year to make my dream a reality.  <strong>My music is ready, my studio musicians are prepared; this indiegogo campaign is the last step towards creating my first ever full length solo studio album.</strong></p>

<h3>What your contribution will fund:</h3>

<li>

<li>
<u>Mixing and Mastering</u>: All tracks will be mixed and mastered for the best sound experience possible.  This will guarantee a cohesive album for your listening pleasure.</li>
<li>
<u>CD printing and distribution:</u>  I plan to print CDs and include the work of local artists and photographers in the CD jacket and booklet.   All backers of my campaign will receive a copy of the CD and it will be available for sale at my local performances as well.  Your contribution will allow me to get my CD manufactured by one of the top companies on the market, ensuring a high quality sound for the CD itself and a stunning presentation for the jacket and CD booklet.</li>

<u>Compensation for local studio musicians: </u>I am incredibly blessed to have a solid crew of local musicians who are learning my original songs and adding amazing talent to this record.  Your contribution will help me compensate them fairly for their efforts.</li>

<p><b><br/>$33,000???  WTF??</b><br/>Um, we're only trying to raise $29,000, dude.<br/><br/><br/><b>$29,000???  WTF??<br/></b>Well, the actual cost of recording just <b><u>one</u> album is $29,000. </b> So, releasing<b> 3 new albums costs even more --</b> but we're only asking fans to fund 1/3 of our actual costs. <b> <i>You're getting 2 extra albums free!  <br/></i></b><br/>Recording and releasing albums is expensive.  We have to pay for arranging, production, rehearsal space, studio time, engineers, equipment rental, royalties/licensing, artwork, editing, mixing, mastering, marketing, crowdfunding commissions, legal expenses, Paypal fees, manufacturing, order fulfillment, plus <b>I pay our musicians fairly for their hard work and talent</b>.  </p>
<p>Also, the money we're raising <b>CREATES JOBS! </b> We DON'T just pocket it!!!!  Musicians, arrangers, engineers, graphic artists, recording studios, manufacturers,  and pornstars will get <b>HIRED </b>to work on our albums.  We are a small business; PLEASE help us help other small businesses!<br/><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>WHY DO WE NEED OUR FANS TO HELP US? </b> <br/>We are an indie band without major record label funding.  And, we're a cover band, so we don't make revenue from songwriting and we pay out substantial royalties to the original song artists.  We aren't able to tour extensively, we aren't rich, and we're not even that popular, either! <b> All of this comes out of my pocket.  </b>I am only seeking enough money to continue making albums for YOU, our devoted and swanky fans.  Can you afford to help?  Please do.  <br/><br/>In the past, we've had about 425 people contribute to our CD funding campaigns.  Out of 118,000 Facebook fans, only 425 people were willing to put their money where their lounge is.  What we need is <b>MORE fans </b>to kick in and spread The Cheese and help us reach the funding goal. <b><i> It's up to YOU. </i></b> Thanks for your support and loyalty, and thank you for keeping lounge music alive.<br/><br/></p>

<div><div>
<b>What format are the digital download files?</b><br/>The digital album downloads will be delivered to you with download codes through BandCamp.com, which offers downloads in MP3, MP3 320, FLAC, ALAC (Apple Lossless), AAC, or Ogg Vorbis.  I have no idea what the fuck any of that means.</div></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><div>
<b>Will you still release the 3 albums if you don't hit your funding goal?</b><br/>We're not sure, let's hope we don't have to find out!  (We chose IndieGoGo's ""flexible funding"" option because that is the only way to accept payments via both credit cards and PayPal; however, the intent is that this is a ""fixed funding"" campaign.)  If we don't reach our funding goal, we still hope to release the 3 albums using other funding sources (bank loans, selling plasma, etc.).  If not, we will refund <u>100%</u> all of the contributions.</div></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<p><b>Will these albums be family-friendly or do they have swears?</b><br/>The ""Live At The Boulder Theater"" album is a filthy and offensive obscenity-filled fuckfest.  But the other two albums are family-friendly because we're trying to get our music into commercials and mainstream TV shows and they're a bunch of pussies.</p>

<p><b>Can I submit a different name to be listed in the credits or for an autograph?</b><br/>Yes, we can accept your name or a friend's name or a business name.  We will contact all of our contributors in September/October to get the name info.  If you don't specify a name, autograph will be signed to the name on the order.  Names or business names in credits are subject to approval, at our sole discretion.  For autographs, first names only, no messages.  <b>*** UPDATE:</b>  The ""Name In Credits"" ($75) perk offer has been updated.  Name will be included in the digital booklets for all 3 albums, AND name will ALSO be printed inside the ""Supermassive Black Tux"" CD jacket!</p>

** FAQs **

What if my address changes before I receive my items?Please be sure to notify us at lounge@richardcheese.com IF your shipping address changes.  Be sure your IndieGogo account's email address is correct so you can be contacted after funding is complete.  If you provide an incorrect shipping address, and your shipment is returned by the post office, you will be required to pay for the costs of re-shipping before we can re-ship your order.  

$33,000???  WTF??Um, we're only trying to raise $29,000, dude.$29,000???  WTF??Well, the actual cost of recording just one album is $29,000.  So, releasing 3 new albums costs even more -- but we're only asking fans to fund 1/3 of our actual costs.  You're getting 2 extra albums free!  Recording and releasing albums is expensive.  We have to pay for arranging, production, rehearsal space, studio time, engineers, equipment rental, royalties/licensing, artwork, editing, mixing, mastering, marketing, crowdfunding commissions, legal expenses, Paypal fees, manufacturing, order fulfillment, plus I pay our musicians fairly for their hard work and talent.  
Also, the money we're raising CREATES JOBS!  We DON'T just pocket it!!!!  Musicians, arrangers, engineers, graphic artists, recording studios, manufacturers,  and pornstars will get HIRED to work on our albums.  We are a small business; PLEASE help us help other small businesses!

WHY DO WE NEED OUR FANS TO HELP US?  We are an indie band without major record label funding.  And, we're a cover band, so we don't make revenue from songwriting and we pay out substantial royalties to the original song artists.  We aren't able to tour extensively, we aren't rich, and we're not even that popular, either!  All of this comes out of my pocket.  I am only seeking enough money to continue making albums for YOU, our devoted and swanky fans.  Can you afford to help?  Please do.  In the past, we've had about 425 people contribute to our CD funding campaigns.  Out of 118,000 Facebook fans, only 425 people were willing to put their money where their lounge is.  What we need is MORE fans to kick in and spread The Cheese and help us reach the funding goal.  It's up to YOU.  Thanks for your support and loyalty, and thank you for keeping lounge music alive.

** MORE FAQs **


Why only U.S. only?Digital downloads are available worldwide.  But due to ridiculous postal fees, we can only ship merchandise items to U.S. addresses, no international or APO/FPO.  Sorry, mon frère!  If you do order from outside the U.S., the shipping cost is an additional $58!   That's what it costs us to ship internationally with tracking to ensure packages are delivered. 






Why no CDs?*** UPDATE:  WE ARE RELEASING THE ALBUMS ON CD!!!!!!!  All 3 albums will be released on CDs, to be shipped in December 2015.  See the Perk section at right for offer details.To change your order from digital albums to CDs, just sign-in to IndieGoGo, select ""Upgrade to Higher Priced Perk,"" and purchase the new $30 perk with the CDs.  This cancels your previous $19 contribution, which will be automatically refunded.  Be sure you provide your CURRENT MAILING ADDRESS and make sure your email address works! Yay! CDs! Yay!Yay!  Please tell your friends about our fund-raising campaign with this link:  http://igg.me/at/rc3



What about vinyl?Not gonna happen, duuuude.


What format are the digital download files?The digital album downloads will be delivered to you with download codes through BandCamp.com, which offers downloads in MP3, MP3 320, FLAC, ALAC (Apple Lossless), AAC, or Ogg Vorbis.  I have no idea what the fuck any of that means.


Will you still release the 3 albums if you don't hit your funding goal?We're not sure, let's hope we don't have to find out!  (We chose IndieGoGo's ""flexible funding"" option because that is the only way to accept payments via both credit cards and PayPal; however, the intent is that this is a ""fixed funding"" campaign.)  If we don't reach our funding goal, we still hope to release the 3 albums using other funding sources (bank loans, selling plasma, etc.).  If not, we will refund 100% all of the contributions.


Will these albums be family-friendly or do they have swears?The ""Live At The Boulder Theater"" album is a filthy and offensive obscenity-filled fuckfest.  But the other two albums are family-friendly because we're trying to get our music into commercials and mainstream TV shows and they're a bunch of pussies.




Can I contribute more than the minimum pledge amount?Yes. Just click on the ""Pledge Amount"" and enter the new amount.  Any donation or additional contribution payment above listed perk prices shall be designated as gift.  Please don't contribute unless you're super rich.  Want to modify your pledge? See ""Upgrade to Higher Priced Perk"" instructions above.  Deadline is September 20!

Can I submit a different name to be listed in the credits or for an autograph?Yes, we can accept your name or a friend's name or a business name.  We will contact all of our contributors in September/October to get the name info.  If you don't specify a name, autograph will be signed to the name on the order.  Names or business names in credits are subject to approval, at our sole discretion.  For autographs, first names only, no messages.  *** UPDATE:  The ""Name In Credits"" ($75) perk offer has been updated.  Name will be included in the digital booklets for all 3 albums, AND name will ALSO be printed inside the ""Supermassive Black Tux"" CD jacket!




Can I get an autographed copy of the digital download album?Ha ha ha, very funny.    No.



How can I hire the Richard Cheese band for my corporate event or wedding?Visit http://www.richardcheese.com and click ""Hire The Band.""  You can also check our tour schedule (LA 10/10, SF 10/16, DC 10/30, Vegas 11/13) and read more zany FAQs.


Was my comment deleted?Please do not post any comments/messages on IndieGoGo.  Send us an email instead to lounge@richardcheese.com.

When will my credit card or PayPal account be charged?Some payments are processed instantly, some take a few days.  Your statement will show payment to ""COVERAGE RECORDS"" or ""LOUNGEMART"" or ""INDIEGOGO.""  For technical support, visit www.indiegogo.com.


Where is the restroom?Down the hall, second door on the left.


What if my address changes before I receive my items?Please be sure to notify us at lounge@richardcheese.com IF your shipping address changes.  Be sure your IndieGogo account's email address is correct so you can be contacted after funding is complete.  If you provide an incorrect shipping address, and your shipment is returned by the post office, you will be required to pay for the costs of re-shipping before we can re-ship your order.  

What happened with those other crowd-funding campaigns?My loyal fans have been very generous and supportive over the years, helping Richard Cheese & Lounge Against The Machine raise money for four CDs, a book, several T-Shirts, and even to help pay my medical bills for corneal surgery!  You can review our previous crowd-funding campaigns in the Notes section of our Facebook page www.facebook.com/richardcheese.  If you have questions about a past contribution, just send an email to lounge@richardcheese.com with your transaction receipt.
When is your ""Atlas Lounged"" book finally coming out?After many delays, due to the aforementioned corneal surgery and a few other medical setbacks, my ""Atlas Lounged"" autobiography book will finally be released in mid-2016.  For complete details, visit www.atlaslounged.com. 

After the IndieGoGo campaign ends, how can I get the albums/CDs?You can order CDs and album downloads, while supplies last, at our fabulous webstore at http://shop.richardcheese.com

<p>Metal greetings everyone!</p>
<p>We are PERSONA, a modern metal band founded in Tunisia, and since a year ago based in Hanover, Germany. After two full-length studio albums, one single, six music videos, and quite a number of live concerts, we felt we had to take some time off to rethink, and replan our future steps. The move to Germany was the biggest and most important step of all, which then resulted in line-up changes, and consequently in the change of our vision, and goals. Now we're back, more inspired than ever, and we invite you to participate in the next chapter of our story: <strong>OUR THIRD ALBUM</strong>! <br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1604330989/gzovqrnabigzjoqu4rwq.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>
<br/>The Album</h3>
<p>This time we're significantly raising the bar of the sound production and the songwriting process, taking the entire approach to a whole new level. While still following the route of an independent band, this time we have a professional music producer <a href=""http://marcomeyer.weebly.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Marco Meyer</a> on board. He's doing a fantastic job in helping us with the arrangements, composition, and production of this album, leading us the way to reaching our full potential. The result you can anticipate will be unique, profound, but at the same time powerful and fun songs, with lots of groove and addictive hooks. '<a href=""https://youtu.be/U1G6q0-Apc0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Alpha</a>' as our first single illustrates one of the multifaceted expressions we're exploring in this album but fear not: all of you who are fans of melodious and clean vocals won't be disappointed either! </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We are extremely proud of the songs that have been finalized so far, and we can't wait to finish the whole album and share it with you. But first, we are kindly asking for your support because to an independent band like ourselves that support truly means everything.  </p>
<p>We need your help with the expenses required to professionally produce and release a full-length album: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pre-production days &amp; work with the producer</strong></li>
<li><strong>Recording, mixing &amp; mastering</strong></li>
<li><strong>Artwork &amp; booklet design</strong></li>
<li>
<strong>Promotion</strong><br/> </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>€15.000</strong> is our first goal and it's the amount needed for these necessary steps to be financed. We can assure you that the album will be released no matter what and we can guarantee the delivery of each perk.</p>
<p><strong>€20.000</strong> is our first stretch goal. If we reach that, we will be able to shoot an additional <strong>music video</strong> and produce a limited amount of <strong>VINYL</strong> pressed copies of the <strong>new album</strong>. If it happens during the campaign, we will make it available as a perk, too!<br/><br/><strong>€25.000</strong> is our second stretch goal. This will allow us to shoot one more <strong>music video</strong>, and to press our albums <i>'<strong>Elusive Reflections'</strong></i><strong> </strong>&amp; <i>'<strong>Metamorphosis'</strong></i><strong> </strong>on <strong>VINYL</strong> as well! <br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1604437579/eo1cncbexo2bppatgevo.jpg"" src=""""/><br/> </p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>If you support us by purchasing the album through our campaign: </p>
<ul>
<li>Your <strong>name</strong> will be <strong>in the booklet</strong>!</li>
<li>You will get a <strong>SIGNED</strong> <strong>hardcopy</strong> of our album!</li>
<li>You will get the digital copy of our album <strong>BEFORE THE RELEASE DATE</strong>!<br/> </li>

</div></div>","Metal greetings everyone!
We are PERSONA, a modern metal band founded in Tunisia, and since a year ago based in Hanover, Germany. After two full-length studio albums, one single, six music videos, and quite a number of live concerts, we felt we had to take some time off to rethink, and replan our future steps. The move to Germany was the biggest and most important step of all, which then resulted in line-up changes, and consequently in the change of our vision, and goals. Now we're back, more inspired than ever, and we invite you to participate in the next chapter of our story: OUR THIRD ALBUM! 

The Album
This time we're significantly raising the bar of the sound production and the songwriting process, taking the entire approach to a whole new level. While still following the route of an independent band, this time we have a professional music producer Marco Meyer on board. He's doing a fantastic job in helping us with the arrangements, composition, and production of this album, leading us the way to reaching our full potential. The result you can anticipate will be unique, profound, but at the same time powerful and fun songs, with lots of groove and addictive hooks. 'Alpha' as our first single illustrates one of the multifaceted expressions we're exploring in this album but fear not: all of you who are fans of melodious and clean vocals won't be disappointed either! 
 
What We Need
We are extremely proud of the songs that have been finalized so far, and we can't wait to finish the whole album and share it with you. But first, we are kindly asking for your support because to an independent band like ourselves that support truly means everything.  
We need your help with the expenses required to professionally produce and release a full-length album: 

Pre-production days & work with the producer
Recording, mixing & mastering
Artwork & booklet design

Promotion 

€15.000 is our first goal and it's the amount needed for these necessary steps to be financed. We can assure you that the album will be released no matter what and we can guarantee the delivery of each perk.
€20.000 is our first stretch goal. If we reach that, we will be able to shoot an additional music video and produce a limited amount of VINYL pressed copies of the new album. If it happens during the campaign, we will make it available as a perk, too!€25.000 is our second stretch goal. This will allow us to shoot one more music video, and to press our albums 'Elusive Reflections' & 'Metamorphosis' on VINYL as well!  
What You Get
If you support us by purchasing the album through our campaign: 

Your name will be in the booklet!
You will get a SIGNED hardcopy of our album!
You will get the digital copy of our album BEFORE THE RELEASE DATE! 

There's also a variety of nice perks you can choose from, some of them with more personalized items like: 

Handwritten lyrics
Stage outfits
Virtual 'Meet & Greet' with the band
Jumpsuits used in ""Alpha"" music video

<h3>BIRKENSTOCKS</h3>
<p>If we haven't met, my name is Naim and I am always making fun music-related projects. I am working on my next album ""MadHappy"". I just released my first single ""HOLD TIGHT"", my ode to everything I love. </p>
<p>My next project is a video called BIRKENSTOCKS. I shot it already, (you can see a snippet of BIRKENSTOCKS at the end of the HOLD TIGHT video). The problem is BIRKENSTOCKS is entirely too plain. I need help getting the desired FX done to make BIRKENSTOCKS smash way harder when people first see it.</p>
<p>This is important to me because:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is my first big project since I left the states</li>
<li>Its' packed  with real attitude and truth</li>
<li>Also, my first video hiring a professional FX artist </li>
<li>This videos' impact as a group effort goes farther than I can take it alone.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The idea is simple, I just need to raise the cost of the video FX artist &amp; a small ad $850:</p>
<ul>
<li>I need $750 to secure the funding for the FX artist. Their work is here:  <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/flash__films"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.instagram.com/flash__films</a>
</li>
<li>I additionally want to run a small $100 ad campaign for the youtube video</li>
<li>If you contribute you will get to see the full BIRKENSTOCK video right now before the FX</li>
<li>You will also get Executive Producer credits or Actual Executive Producer Credits (ie. $ percentage of earnings)</li>
<li>If I don't reach my entire goal, I don't get any of the money</li>
<li>If I go over my goal, I will use the funds for the ad campaign and to hire a film crew for the next music video</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>My message is very DIY. I love that about my brand. I would like to take this opportunity to step up the quality in approach for sake of the message:</p>
<ul>
<li>My aim is to always inspire young creatives who look like me to believe in possibilities </li>
<li>I was very happy with what I learned through my last Indiegogo, and how it connected me to my music family <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/relationrocket-an-intergalactic-love-story#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/relationrock...</a>
</li>
<li>You can be a part of something dope that could affect more people than just us</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>There is no risk, but the challenge is always time. This will shorten the time required for me to accomplish a video worth sharing.</li>
<li>Without you, there is just me. ""We"" help me feel like there are believers in positivity out there. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Share this with your friends with money who are looking for to be a part of something cool or want some Executive Producer Credits</p>

new $18 ""UNITED WE LOUNGE"" T-SHIRT and other stuff so I can afford to hire lawyers
to sue the shady cheating jerkweasels who ripped me off!See, there are these shady cheating jerkweasels who have stolen thousands of dollars from my Richard Cheese & Lounge Against The Machine band.  I can't reveal all the details, but there was some shifty accounting, some breach of contract, some credit card fraud, and perhaps even some flight to avoid prosecution.   Let's just say shady cheating jerkweasels covers it.I recently discovered that one of these showbiz swindlers ripped me off for $6,500, another company owes me $8,000, and another business stole $13,000 from me!  I am not good at math, but I think that's a total of $27,491!Anyway, after much legal wrangling, my only option now is to take these personae mofos  (that is a Latin legal term) to court. Alas, I've already spent more than $6,000 of my savings pursuing these matters, and it's going to cost me at least   $20,000 MORE in court costs and auditor/legal fees!The reason they stole from me is because they didn't think I would be able to afford to fight them.   They thought they could get away with it.But   I'm   not   going   to   give   up.And with your help, I won't have to.   United We Lounge!So...I am selling  ALL-NEW RICHARD CHEESE ""UNITED WE LOUNGE"" MARTINI FLAG T-SHIRTS  for just $18 each, to raise money to help pay for the litigation costs.These new red-white-and-blue ""United We Lounge"" T-Shirts are 100% cotton, and they're available in Men's Sizes Small thru 5XL!  (Women's shirts are also available, email us for info.)   These swanky shirts are a perfect fit for the upcoming U.S. elections, too! These T-shirts will retail for $25, so order now to save big, just $18 each (plus shipping).   U.S. Only.*With each ""United We Lounge"" T-Shirt, you'll also get a free Richard Cheese sticker, and some other free bonus items!   And the first 100 contributors will also receive a free Richard Cheese ""Dick At Nite"" CD with every shirt order!Also...

If you contribute $66, I will personally autograph your T-Shirt to you! (U.S. Only!)And, for $1500, I, Richard Cheese, will PERSONALLY DELIVER YOUR T-SHIRT TO YOU, ANYWHERE IN THE U.S.A.!!!  (U.S. Only!)You can also contribute to get an eBook of my forthcoming ""Atlas Lounged"" book, get your name or photo printed in the book, get personally thanked on Twitter/Facebook, or get a personal singing birthday message from Richard Cheese on your birthday, shortie!
Why?The reason I am asking for contributions is because, as you probably heard, I spent all my savings on medical bills over the last two years.  And, since I've been on the injured list, I haven't been able to bring in any income from performing/touring (we haven't done a show since July 2013).   So, I am asking my fans to buy some shirts so I can afford to fight these nefarious thieving pigdogs.Once I resolve these disputes, and get this money back, I can afford to start working on a new Richard Cheese album!!!!!I need $20K to pursue the litigation; I'm trying to raise $10K from this Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign.  I just need to sell 400 T-Shirts ... please tell your fellow Richard Cheese fan friends, and share the  http://igg.me/at/unitedwelounge  link, so I can reach my funding goal.

Thanks! :)
I am grateful and lucky to have so many swanky fans, and I appreciate your loyalty.  Thank you very much for your generous support of my Richard Cheese & Lounge Against The Machine band, my unrelenting pursuit of cold hard justice, and my ridiculous font sizes.

 Dear Beloved Richard Cheese Fans:

Last year, I took four of those jerkweasels to small claims court and mediation -- and I won!  Justice prevailed in every case and I actually got some of my money back!!!However, two of the other  RatJerks are being ratjerky, and now I am forced to kick it up to some next level biznass for realz with judges and depositions and gavels and shit. I have a great team of attorneys -- they wrote that last sentence -- and they are confident that I will win this fight.  But, the cost of this litigation is going to be at least another $20,000 for attorney fees, court filings, and other legal expenses. I've already spent $35,000  of my own money pursuing these  RatJerks.  They thought I would give up and let it go, but I'm in it to win it.I'm  going  to  keep  fighting.   If you want to join the fight, I am selling ALL-NEW RICHARD CHEESE  ""LIFE, LIBERTY, AND THE PURSUIT OF SWANKINESS"" MARTINI FLAG T-SHIRTS for just $19 each, to raise money to help pay for the litigation costs.  These new red-white-and-blue on black T-Shirts are 100% cotton, printed in the U.S.A, and they're available in Men's and Women's Sizes.  These snazzy shirts are a perfect fit for the upcoming U.S. elections, too!   I am also selling some RARE RICHARD CHEESE COLLECTIBLE SOUVENIRS, including exclusive and out-of-print posters, sheet music charts, original CD artwork, my original lounge microphone, and my one-of-a-kind tiger-striped tux jacket!!!  See pics below!  *** Choose a perk from the list at right!  ***   I need $20K to fund the fight; I'm trying to raise at least $10K from this Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign.    I just need to sell 400 T-Shirts ... please tell your fellow Richard Cheese fan friends, and share the http://igg.me/at/FightRatJerks link!   I am grateful and lucky to have so many swanky fans, and I sincerely appreciate your loyalty and your generous support of Richard Cheese & Lounge Against The Machine.  I thank you, my musicians thank you, and my ridiculous   font sizes      thank you.  United We Lounge,--RC, 3/8/2016lounge@richardcheese.com P.S.

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Our Problem</span></h3>
<p>We are a powerful community with over 1500 members across the UK, but our main point of contact is the facebook group.</p>
<p>The group has too many posts every day, and that means that not all of them get seen. It's a disorganised community space, hard to search for relevant topics, and some people end up posting all the time, while others don't post at all because facebook's algorithm does't show their beautiful songs to many people.</p>
<p>It's also hard to moderate, and some members post about irrelevant topics, which clog up our feeds and dampen our experience.</p>
<p>All told, it's a chaotic space!</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I have everything ready to build this, the content, the web designer, the plan, and most importantly, 1500 people who would like to join! But I need help raising the initial cost of creating the platform, so I thought a fun way to fund it would be to crowdfund it from the members here on indiegogo, giving you a chance to get in as a founder member, get a discount on what will be the membership costs, and the opportunity to secure either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lifetime membership - 'Access All Areas Pass' for life. That means, free events, masterclasses, monthly songwriting workshops and more. Forever.</li>
<li>Premium membership - Monthly online songwriting workshop, free events and masterclasses, and all other member privileges</li>
<li>Standard membership - Access to the members platform with the monthly competition, forums, your own online and real world TisT group, and access to the masterclasses.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>Crowdfunding Goals</h3>
<p>At £1600, I can build the platform in August and launch it in September - October 2021.</p>
<p>At £4000, I can take on a part time staff member to manage the content allowing it to be run more professionally and to create more opportunities for members by reaching out to press, engaging the media and creating real world events.</p>
<p>If we raise £10,000, I can invest in making this community bigger and dedicate more of my time to it. I can run the competition again next year, open it in the USA &amp; EU, and run a free members only event.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Did you know that only a third of people who entered the competition donated?</p>
<p>Did you know that thus far, the entire community is run on volunteers?</p>
<p>And as wonderful as that is, it can't stay that way forever. But thankfully it doesn't need to. With a little input from enough people we can create a powerful community membership platform and continue to spread the joy of songwriting and to connect people across the UK.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>After the 'Talent Is Timeless' competition I was left with a community of songwriters bursting with new inspiration.</p>
<p>I couldn't just close the project and leave everyone disappointed! They were thirsting for more.</p>
<p>So I've dedicated the majority of my time this year to running the Talent Is Timeless online community, entirely for free.</p>
<p>As things pick up I not only need to invest in building a custom membership site to make Talent Is Timeless a better platform, but in order to dedicate my time to it, I need to turn it into something that runs with a small budget, month to month, year to year, for running costs of all the tech, some staff fees for people who work on TisT projects, and to give us some resources for putting on events and creating education and performance opportunities for members to develop their craft, connect with each other and get their music heard.</p>
<p>By supporting this indiegogo campaign you are not only helping this platform be built, but you are helping real people in the UK and eventually across the world to tap in to that creative energy that drives us, and to connect with other people who feel it too.</p>
<p>As the founder and leader of this project, I am dedicated to sharing with you the best that the music industry has to offer, and that means: Interviews with celebrities and songwriters, masterclasses with various professionals on honing our craft, giving you trusted contacts of mine to help develop your reach, and creating spaces where you can meet each other and pool your wisdom and experience.</p>

</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Vision</h3>
<p>If we're really going to do this, let's do it right.</p>
<p>Each year this community gets bigger and bigger, but that won't dilute the experience because I'm structuring it so that everyone has their close group of members that entered the same time they did, and their own group feedback sessions online and in person, as well as access to the entire community.</p>
<p>I also see this platform as something people can take and use to make their own. If you want to host a local TisT group - be my guest! The more the merrier, especially when it comes to any creative community.</p>
<p>I will grow this community internationally too, so people from around the world age 50 and over can come together and experience the benefit of being connected to each other and inspired to make music. It will also give our co-writer generator an international twist so we can choose to co-write with local or global members to foster a wider community for those that want it.</p>
<p>Each year as we get more and more members we attract bigger and better celebrity judges, bigger sponsors, and better opportunities for the winner, runners up, monthly winners and members in general. Do you think we can get Dylan as a judge? Tom Jones? Paul McCartney? It's not as far off as you might think.</p>
<p>Some other future ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>A festival</li>
<li>A studio session lottery</li>
<li>A playlist for members songs</li>
<li>Tour facilitation - where members can help each other to find venues in their local areas for the performing songwriters in the groups</li>

That's the mission.
There is no age limit to enjoying music, as the audience, performer, songwriter or producer.
​And there is no age limit to quality.
This movement exists to:

Connect songwriters over age 50 to a supportive community
Inspire them to bring out their best work yet
Encourage them to share their music
Prove that talent has no age limit

 

 
Our Problem
We are a powerful community with over 1500 members across the UK, but our main point of contact is the facebook group.
The group has too many posts every day, and that means that not all of them get seen. It's a disorganised community space, hard to search for relevant topics, and some people end up posting all the time, while others don't post at all because facebook's algorithm does't show their beautiful songs to many people.
It's also hard to moderate, and some members post about irrelevant topics, which clog up our feeds and dampen our experience.
All told, it's a chaotic space!
 
The Solution
To build and host our own fully professional membership site that have free, standard and premium membership levels:
Free tier:

Access to fb group
Access to monthly masterclasses via facebook group
Access to monthly songwriting challenges via facebook group
Invites to TisT member events
Access to annual competition

£3 (discounted price here) - £5 per month:

‘Educated Entry’ video lesson series
Regular masterclasses broadcast with a clear link
Members forums on all and any topics
A dedicated #GAOSSNL page per month
The monthly competition
And voting on the monthly competition
Clear monthly/annual calendar
Access to a co-writer generator for those that want to mix it up
Access to assigned online TisT group (online folk club style)
Access to local TisT groups (when they are going in the real world)
Automated monthly member feature lottery
Discounts/free passes to real world member events

£20 (discounted price here) - £30 per month:

All standard member benefits, and:
Submission to TisT playlist
Access to monthly songwriting workshop (via zoom)

I will also assign a number of 'hardship places' for people who would like to be part of the community but can't afford the fee.

<h3>Who we are</h3>
<p>We hope this message is broadcast far and wide, so for anyone who's found us through this crowdfunder and doesn't know who we are and what we do... </p>
<p>We're a UK-based LGBT+ punk rock band from the south coast, and in our first year together we recorded an EP and toured through Southampton Pride, Reading Pride and Surrey Pride, as well as Northamptonshire's Queer Spirit Festival.</p>
<p>Our identities are at the forefront of what we do because there's simply not enough representation out there of queer people in the music scene. Until it's normal, we will be loud about who we are and what we do. This means we attract wonderful fans and deter the haters and 'phobes. That being said, we're an inclusive band. We roll with a straight, cis-het Christian man on our team. He's a fantastic role model for what being an ally really means. Our identities don't have to cause conflict if we're willing to listen to each other and put kindness first. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What's this crowdfunder about then?</h3>
<p>We have 11 tracks raring to go, just waiting to be recorded into our first album.  But it's not only the music, it's a whole world we are building. We want to immerse fans and listeners in this world. We'll be starting that experience at the launch of this crowdfunder in the form of an online puzzle trail. This album cycle will also feature at least three related music videos and a plethora of merch and unique artwork. We'll either produce this in-house, using our band's diverse skillsets, or with independent artists and freelancers, with whom we have forged excellent relationships. </p>
<p>Part of our plan, before the pandemic, was to save up money from gigs and merch to help us fund this album. Obviously, we haven't been able to follow through with that, but this time has allowed us room to really work on these songs. As individuals, we all have day jobs and contribute what we can to the band, but to get the rest of the way there we need a little help. So, that's where you (potentially) come in. </p>
<p>It's safe to say we've grown and improved as musicians since recording our EP. We've developed our sound to another level that represents who we are right now and what we aim to achieve. We really believe in this music. We believe it should be heard and that it'll have a positive impact on people's lives. There are songs for a workout playlist. Songs to shout to, drive to, make out to, cry to and protest to. </p>
<p>If we reach our goal, we'll be able to cover the cost of recording and post-production at the local studio - The Ranch - where we recorded our EP. We have chosen them for our established relationship, their welcoming environment for LGBT+ individuals and because we're confident they'll help us deliver this album, without limitations. </p>
<p>This is also a chance for us to get our fans involved. As you'll see with the perks, there'll be plenty of opportunities to make your own mark on this album. We want to start as we mean to go on. This is not just our band, this is your band too.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What it will mean to us</h3>
<p>Honestly, we'd be overwhelmed to receive so much trust and support from people. We're creating this crowdfunder as a bit of a stab in the dark. We're not sure what to expect.</p>
<p>Grand it may seem, we see our existence as a band and the music we make as something bigger than us. It's about LGBT+ youth in difficult situations being able to hear us and know that they're not alone, know that they are valid, worthy and accepted. There is a community out there waiting for them. It's about people who go through ridicule and abuse having music to relate to, a message to counter when they're told they're unworthy, unlovable and that they don't fit in. It's about people outside of the community hearing our music, relating to it and discovering that we aren't so dissimilar after all.

</div></div>","Who we are
We hope this message is broadcast far and wide, so for anyone who's found us through this crowdfunder and doesn't know who we are and what we do... 
We're a UK-based LGBT+ punk rock band from the south coast, and in our first year together we recorded an EP and toured through Southampton Pride, Reading Pride and Surrey Pride, as well as Northamptonshire's Queer Spirit Festival.
Our identities are at the forefront of what we do because there's simply not enough representation out there of queer people in the music scene. Until it's normal, we will be loud about who we are and what we do. This means we attract wonderful fans and deter the haters and 'phobes. That being said, we're an inclusive band. We roll with a straight, cis-het Christian man on our team. He's a fantastic role model for what being an ally really means. Our identities don't have to cause conflict if we're willing to listen to each other and put kindness first. 
 

What's this crowdfunder about then?
We have 11 tracks raring to go, just waiting to be recorded into our first album.  But it's not only the music, it's a whole world we are building. We want to immerse fans and listeners in this world. We'll be starting that experience at the launch of this crowdfunder in the form of an online puzzle trail. This album cycle will also feature at least three related music videos and a plethora of merch and unique artwork. We'll either produce this in-house, using our band's diverse skillsets, or with independent artists and freelancers, with whom we have forged excellent relationships. 
Part of our plan, before the pandemic, was to save up money from gigs and merch to help us fund this album. Obviously, we haven't been able to follow through with that, but this time has allowed us room to really work on these songs. As individuals, we all have day jobs and contribute what we can to the band, but to get the rest of the way there we need a little help. So, that's where you (potentially) come in. 
It's safe to say we've grown and improved as musicians since recording our EP. We've developed our sound to another level that represents who we are right now and what we aim to achieve. We really believe in this music. We believe it should be heard and that it'll have a positive impact on people's lives. There are songs for a workout playlist. Songs to shout to, drive to, make out to, cry to and protest to. 
If we reach our goal, we'll be able to cover the cost of recording and post-production at the local studio - The Ranch - where we recorded our EP. We have chosen them for our established relationship, their welcoming environment for LGBT+ individuals and because we're confident they'll help us deliver this album, without limitations. 
This is also a chance for us to get our fans involved. As you'll see with the perks, there'll be plenty of opportunities to make your own mark on this album. We want to start as we mean to go on. This is not just our band, this is your band too.

What it will mean to us
Honestly, we'd be overwhelmed to receive so much trust and support from people. We're creating this crowdfunder as a bit of a stab in the dark. We're not sure what to expect.
Grand it may seem, we see our existence as a band and the music we make as something bigger than us. It's about LGBT+ youth in difficult situations being able to hear us and know that they're not alone, know that they are valid, worthy and accepted. There is a community out there waiting for them. It's about people who go through ridicule and abuse having music to relate to, a message to counter when they're told they're unworthy, unlovable and that they don't fit in. It's about people outside of the community hearing our music, relating to it and discovering that we aren't so dissimilar after all. We all love. We all feel pain. And we all want to be loved.
And we all want to dance (even if it's secretly, alone, in your bedroom). 
If we finish this album as we envision it, we feel like we'd have the chance to get our message out there, get our music heard and increase our audience of Underdog Kids. We'll do everything in our power to make that happen, but your support would help us so much. 
 

What could go wrong?
We think it's best to be honest and up front about the challenges and hurdles we may face in making this album.
The main thing that could happen is that we might need more time in the studio. However, if that's the case, we can cover those costs from our own pockets, even if it takes a little time. This would potentially push out our perk delivery deadlines a little! 
The £3000 target is a dream goal, covering not just recording but with further merchanidse ideas and help us record music videos. Never fret, however; even if we fall short, we'll find a way to make this album happen. 
Since this is the first time we've done something like this, we hope the perks are appetising and our delivery schedule realistic. We foresee some of those deadlines as being the main variables.

<h3>Hi,</h3>
<p>My name is <strong>Duncan Lyall</strong>. I’m an award-winning musician, composer and record producer from Scotland.</p>
<p>Over the past 18 months I have been working hard, recording and producing <strong>Milestone</strong> - a suite of new music that I was commissioned to write for the world-renowned <strong>Celtic Connections</strong> festival, January 2019 in Glasgow.</p>
<p>I'd probably describe it as <strong>CINEMATICFOLKELECTRONICAROCKFUNK</strong></p>
<p>But I'm not keen to label myself so I'll let you decide.</p>
<p>The Milestone band are:</p>
<ul>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">
<strong>Duncan Lyall:</strong> Bass Guitar, Moog (love) and other synths, Piano, Programming</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">
<strong>Jarlath Henderson: </strong>Uillean Pipes, Whistles, Vocals</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">
<strong>Lori Watson: </strong>Vocals and Fiddle</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">
<strong>Patsy Reid: </strong>Fiddle and Viola</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">
<strong>Angus Lyon:</strong> Keys and Piano</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">
<strong>Chas MacKenzie:</strong> Electric Guitar</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">
<strong>Stuart Brown: </strong>Drum Kit and Percussion</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>I am heavily involved in, and influenced by the vibrant Scottish Folk and Trad music scene. At its core, Milestone is a product of this. But my musical experiences, both as an artist and a fan, reach far and wide beyond this arena. I’ve not been afraid to wear my heart on my sleeve with this music and I'm not ashamed to cite these influences as key to the sound: </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Daft Punk, Cinematic Orchestra, Bjork, Air, Pink Floyd, Jamiroquai, DJ Shadow, The Foo Fighters, Massive Attack, Craig Armstrong, The Beatles… </strong></p>
<p>Basically my old CD collection.</p>
<p>Influences closer to home include bands like <strong>Treacherous Orchestra </strong>and <strong>Croft No. FIve </strong>(both of which I was a member of) and the late visionary, <strong>Martyn Bennett.</strong></p>
<p>Each of these musical influences evokes memories of different milestones in my life. I wanted to pay tribute to some of these moments in the form of a musical response.</p>
<p>From sitting down to write the first bar of music, right through to this point in time, Milestone has been a labour of love. <i>I've worked hard at this.</i> I'm glad I did, because I'm proud of it.</p>
<p>With your valuable support, this work can see the light of day.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The album is recorded and mixed. I managed to get there with the help of Creative Scotland and with my own investment. But I need help getting this album over the line.</p>
<p>I need to raise £6000.</p>
<p>This will cover the cost of mastering the recording, artwork, CD manufacture (yeah we still love CDs in folk music!), licensing, PR and launch promotion, and if all goes well, the creation of music videos for selected tracks. This all means you would be supporting not only me, but some brilliant, dedicated creatives.</p>
<p>The more people that hear this music, the more likely it is to have a future. When live gigs become a thing again, I'd love to take this new band out to perform! I need your support to make that happen.</p>
<p>The simplest way to support this project is to pre-order the album as either a digital download or CD (which includes the digital download). For a little more you can receive a signed CD with an optional dedication.</p>
<p>There are other rewards, including 1:1 production or composition lessons, an online workshop where we break down how Milestone was written and produced, PDFs of the tunes, individual tune commissions, recording sessions... check out the rewards page for more details.</p>

<p><strong>Justin Hiltner</strong> and <strong>Jon Weisberger</strong> here, and we’re back with another round of music from a couple of bluegrass rabble-rousers and community builders.</p>
<p>As you know from our 2018 record, <i>Watch It Burn</i>, and from all the work that we’ve been up to in the bluegrass community, we truly believe that bluegrass is for everyone — and bluegrass gospel is for everyone, too. Bluegrass gospel is an integral part of this music, and when we put together our love for many bluegrass gospel songs with our personal backgrounds — Justin as someone who grew up performing bluegrass gospel, Jon as a frequent writer of bluegrass gospel songs — we thought it was time to take the opportunity to make a bluegrass gospel EP for you. What we made just so happens to illustrate that point – that bluegrass and bluegrass gospel are for everyone – nearly perfectly. </p>
<p>We went to Crossroads Studios in Arden, NC to work with engineer <strong>Scott Barnett</strong> — and as we always do, we used the project as a vehicle for building community by bringing together an exciting group of musicians drawn from across the bluegrass spectrum. In addition to Justin (banjo) and Jon (bass), our band included: Balsam Range’s <strong>Darren Nicholson</strong> on mandolin, High Fidelity’s <strong>Corrina Rose Logston</strong> on fiddle, and multi-instrumentalist <strong>Laura Ray</strong> on guitar. For additional harmony vocals we brought in Nashville’s <strong>Ashleigh Caudill</strong> and Mt. Airy, NC’s <strong>Wendy Hickman</strong>. With this wonderful group of singers and pickers, we recorded six songs: two favorite hymns from Justin’s childhood and four new songs, three written by Ashleigh and Jon — including the title track, “Room At The Table ”— and one written by Ashleigh, Jon and Justin.   </p>
<p>We are so excited to share this music with you! It sounds even better – joyful, intuitive, organic, energetic like good old fashioned bluegrass gospel – than an Indiegogo description could convey. But we hope, above all, this message conveys that we want you to be part of this project, too. The way that you can do that is to contribute to our campaign, to help us cover costs: musicians, studio time, design, manufacturing and promotion.  It’s so meaningful to us to have your support — in fact, we can’t do this without you! This time, we’re keeping it really simple: you can contribute; you can pre-order a digital copy of the project or a physical CD; and if you want to play an even greater role, you can sign up to have your name included in the project credits — and get a note of appreciation signed by both of us!</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter how much you give! Every bit counts and is a direct reflection of the communities that support us and that we want to support right back. We want all of you to know that we know we can’t make music without people who want to hear it. This is one opportunity to let folks know that, like us, you believe that bluegrass — and bluegrass gospel — is for everyone. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello friends,</p>

<h3>Hi, I'm Ari</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<p>I'm a busy and versatile bassist, passionate educator, and bass blogger.</p>
<p>Teaching music is my passion. When I am not playing the bass myself, you will no doubt find me working with my students, leading my bass practice groups, blogging about bass topics, or creating bass courses for my own platform and many other awesome ones - such as Scott's Bass Lessons, TrueFire and notreble.com. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1615083391/dbadrkwkxyoigxieqdie.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I am also an author - my first book, <i>Music Theory for the Bass Player - a Comprehensive Guide to Playing with More Confidence and Freedom </i>-  is a frequent bestseller on Amazon in its category. It continues to sell thousands of copies each year, has a 5-star rating, and hundreds of awesome reviews.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>My first book was a huge success because it flowed from observing my students' asks very closely. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Screenshot from March 2021</strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1615438337/grakwvek8fb4pv7a4uuj.png"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I observe my students very closely and come up with creative ways to help them reach the music inside of themselves. I have developed several programs over the years and they get consistent results. </p>
<h3><strong>I am no fan of gimmicks or mindless practice</strong></h3>
<p>Short-cuts or quick fixes sound tempting but they likely won't get you very far.</p>
<p>On the other hand, spending hours and hours playing boring scales or reading down pages and pages of arpeggios likely gives your fingers a bit of a payoff but you probably won't feel none the wiser afterward.</p>
<h3><strong>A better way...</strong></h3>
<p>My solid, proven methods are engaging because you create your own grooves. You improvise. You are deeply involved <i><strong>creating</strong></i> rather than just <i><strong>re-creating</strong></i>. And that's why it clicks. And sticks! And then it's yours and there is no more satisfying feeling in the world!</p>
<p>My first book was about Music Theory for the Bass Player. You explore the patterns of music and what they look like (and feel like and sound like!) on the bass.   </p>
<h2>My New Book</h2>
<p>My first book was all about Music Theory for the Bass Player. It explored the patterns of music and what they look like (and feel like and sound like!) on the fretboard.   </p>
<h3>The Pattern System for the Bass Player - Sharpen Your Musical Mind through Fretboard Proficiency, Improvisation, and Mental Practice. </h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1615089524/dy9pvv87wijgdtdwqcmj.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>My second book takes this pattern-based approach several steps further. I wrote it along with my partner and teacher Wolfgang Wein. It teaches a solid method of learning the fretboard by going through all the major scales, diatonic triads. pentatonics, common chord progressions... </p>
<p>And we go far beyond that</p>
<ul>
<li>We dive into the <i><strong>beautiful study of the patterns of music itself</strong></i>, not just the fretboard. And we learn them in such a way that you can play with complete freedom.</li>
<li>No more chasing notes.</li>
<li>No more poking around hoping to play what you are hearing inside.</li>
<li>Gain a solid command of the fretboard.</li>
<li>Visualize shapes and patterns and then improvise freely within them at first, then beyond.</li>
<li>And we show you how to practice effectively… including mental practice, and meditational approaches.</li>

<p> </p>
<p>I worked for five years on this book. It uses time-tested methods combined with innovative learning techniques. It puts the student in the driver's seat. </p>
<p>It's a rigorous program - and one I have gone through with hobbyists and pros alike. You’ll get what you put in, but I can promise you that even if you put in a little bit, you’ll get a lot out of it. </p>
<p>Educators and academics will appreciate the well-thought-out layout and flow of the program and pacing, as well as the quiz-able Blueprints and the Test Questions.   </p>

<h3>3 - Additional Study Materials</h3>
<p>After my first book came out I received many emails from readers requesting encores on the topics of this book.

<h3>4 - The Videos</h3>
<p>This book comes with 111 videos that demonstrate the exercises described. We needed editors, videographers, a video consultant (also a musician!), and lots of hard drive space!</p>
<h3>5 - The Wall Chart</h3>
<p>If you get the book, likely you will also want the beautiful wall chart! It is optional - but a great addition to your practice room wall!

<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>Many books have been written on fretboard harmony, but just like with my first book, I wrote it because I saw nothing with the same concept on the market. </p>
<p>My theory book was unique in that it teaches theory on the bass fretboard through diagrams (diagrams and understanding first, reading later!).</p>
<p>This method is unique in that it combines tried-and-tested fretboard harmony drills with mental practice, improvisation, and deep student engagement. It is practical and applicable while stimulating your creativity and understanding of music!</p>

<p>Just like my first book, I gave it my all. I didn't spare a penny or cut a corner.  It was a big risk then, and an even bigger risk now. </p>
<p>But this is no longer my first book! I can now confidently say that I am an experienced self-publisher - so I know the commitment, the challenges, the responsibility. And the many many hours of marketing and distribution work that awaits us here.      </p>
<p>I have done my homework and I feel ready and confident that this book will be well received and that the campaign will be fully funded.</p>

As the lead vocalist of Homeboi, I took a more R&B/alt rock influence, and as featured vocalist on The Backlit Infinite (Minneapolis based synthwave) - definitely a more simplified, upfront pop approach! Please check out my music at the link included to see what I'm about!https://linktr.ee/mikailxxmusic As some of you may remember, January 2020 I announced 'Mint Season' was beginning - three singles leading to my first full length solo album.

To turn this effort into something lasting (one of more to come I hope!), I need to go through the process of making this album a record. Here’s what it entails and what your support will help me do. </p><ul>
<li>
<strong>Creating:</strong> This part is already done! Demos were recorded in our basement in Portland, OR. There are enough songs to get started on the next album too.</li>
<li>
<strong>Mixing:</strong> Erik Walker at <u><a href=""https://wackoworldmusic.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Wacko World Music</a></u> in San Francisco, CA will bring his amazing ear and no-nonsense sensibility to the mix of the songs. I’ve known Erik since we were neighbors and even got to play with him a few times. This will happen in April. </li>
<li>
<strong>Pre-mastering:</strong> Thomas Dimuzio of <a href=""https://www.gench.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>Gench Music</u> </a>will do the premastering to get Erik’s mixes ready for both a vinyl edition and a digital one on Bandcamp. Hopefully this can get turned around in early May. </li>
<li>
<strong>Mastering:</strong> Jon Niess of <u><a href=""http://austinsignal.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Austin Signal</a></u> in Austin, TX will take the tracks and work them so they are in vinyl format. He will also print the artwork/jackets too! Hopefully, before Memorial Day, I will send the tracks to Austin.</li>
<li>
<strong>Plating and Pressing:</strong> Jon will work with <u><a href=""https://www.recordtech.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Record Technologies, Inc.</a></u> in Camarillo, CA to take the “mother” vinyl and turn that into the 20 records I have for all of you. If all goes well, I could get a box of records shipped to me sometime around my 45th birthday in July!</li>
</ul><h3>What You Get:</h3><p>Besides being more influential than you already are in making this project a reality, you will get some/all of the following:</p><ul>
<li>Digital download of the album from Bandcamp</li>
<li>Your name and/or a personal thank you in the digital liner notes on Bandcamp</li>
<li>One of 20 vinyl copies of the album</li>
<li>Personal thank you on the album liner notes on the back of the record jacket</li>
<li>Collaborating with me on a song for the next album</li>
<li>A song for you and/or a loved one</li>
<li>Hugs, high fives, gratitude!</li>
</ul><h3>The Impact:</h3><p>The process of writing songs and recording them is a true passion of mine, and I want this to be just the start of this path for me. I’m hoping that this experience will inspire to continue making music and sharing it with people I love. Maybe there is something in the songs that will resonate with you or others too. Maybe you are also on a journey of discovery, understanding, and/or creativity and this will help you see that you aren’t alone and you can do it too. Because if I can make this dream come true, one that seemed impossible to me, then you can turn your ideas into reality too. </p><p>In addition, I will be donating 25% of sales from my Bandcamp site to two incredible organizations in Portland I connect with as part of my work life that are actively, intentionally, and authentically creating access to equity and music. I encourage you to also help support them if you can.</p><ul>

<strong><a href=""https://friendsofnoise.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>Friends of Noise</u> </a></strong>supports creative youth in Portland through all ages concerts, workshops, and experience navigating the music scene.</li>
</ul><p>Finally, there will be another record. This will help me create momentum for songwriting as a thing I do and will continue to do!    </p><h3>Risks:</h3><p>There is a chance that there will be bumps and delays along the way in the process I outlined above.

<li>And, not leaving any stone unturned, I'm selling some of the records from my collection to help cover the costs of making this album.
