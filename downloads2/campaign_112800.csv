<p>Six talented young writers and performers will represent Tunkhannock at the historic <a href=""http://youthspeaks.org/bravenewvoices/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Brave New Voices International Slam Festival</a>
 in Philadelphia, where teenage poets from over 50 cities gather to 
compete and build community as writers. It is four days of 
transformative dialogue and art, and no person leaves the festival 
unchanged. </p>
<p>This year, we ask your support not only to send our slam team to 
represent Tunkhannock, but also so that a select few leaders who hold 
down the operations of BGP can experience Brave New Voices and 
infuse our yearly programming with the energy, insight and practices 
gained from building with poets from all over the country and the 
globe. <br/></p><p></p><h2><strong>OUR ASK</strong></h2>
<p>In order to send our slam team, four select youth leaders, entourage, and 
supervising mentors from our program to participate
 fully in the slams, workshops, dialogues and performance opportunities 
of Brave New Voices, we need to raise <strong><em>$3,500</em></strong>. 
This money goes towards travel expenses to Philadelphia, dormitory housing and 
board through the festival, 2 meals a day, and all access granted to workshops, town halls, and competitions. <br/></p><b>The Impact</b><p></p><p></p><p>This year's local slams featured amazing performances. These kids were the top six chosen to represent BGP:</p>
<p>• Keri Klinges<br/></p>

</h3>
<p>Since 2011, BGP has been the only youth spoken word poetry organization in North Eastern Pennsylvania. Our community organization focuses on developing  youth 
voices through creative writing instruction and performance 
opportunities. Over the years, BGP has conducted workshops and performances with Andrea Gibson, Lauren Zuniga, Anis Mojgani, Buddy Wakefield, Jon Sands, Jeanann Verlee, Clementine Von Radics and countless local published poets and professors. We have featured at a variety of open mics and hosted our own monthly open mic series that has thrived for 
the past three years.</p>
<p>Our goal is to provide young people with the courage to imagine and 
freedom to create a healthy future for themselves while developing their critical thinking, writing, and performance skills.  <br/></p><p></p><p>And that’s all there is to it. Without your donation, many of these kids will not be able to attend the festival. We come from a rural community where dru<span>g, poverty and family issues present major challenges to our teenagers. As a mentor in our program, I 
am  inspired every day by the teenagers  who make the effort to devote their time on the weekends and after school to cultivate safe spaces and seek out opportunities to raise their voices to create change in a positive manner within our community. <br/></span></p><p><span>I encourage you to make the same effort these teens do and create positive change in our community through your support and donation. <br/></span></p><p><span>Warmly - <br/></span></p><p><span>Katie Wisnosky </span><br/></p></div>","Who We Are

This year, we ask your support not only to send our slam team to 
represent Tunkhannock, but also so that a select few leaders who hold 
down the operations of BGP can experience Brave New Voices and 
infuse our yearly programming with the energy, insight and practices 
gained from building with poets from all over the country and the 
globe. OUR ASK
In order to send our slam team, four select youth leaders, entourage, and 
supervising mentors from our program to participate
 fully in the slams, workshops, dialogues and performance opportunities 
of Brave New Voices, we need to raise $3,500. 
This money goes towards travel expenses to Philadelphia, dormitory housing and 
board through the festival, 2 meals a day, and all access granted to workshops, town halls, and competitions. The ImpactThis year's local slams featured amazing performances. These kids were the top six chosen to represent BGP:
• Keri Klinges
• Angelo Maruzzelli 
•Maggie Gilbertson
• Kiera Merritt
• Aidan Cronin 
• Olivia Romano About Breaking Ground Poets

Since 2011, BGP has been the only youth spoken word poetry organization in North Eastern Pennsylvania. Our community organization focuses on developing  youth 
voices through creative writing instruction and performance 
opportunities. Over the years, BGP has conducted workshops and performances with Andrea Gibson, Lauren Zuniga, Anis Mojgani, Buddy Wakefield, Jon Sands, Jeanann Verlee, Clementine Von Radics and countless local published poets and professors. We have featured at a variety of open mics and hosted our own monthly open mic series that has thrived for 
the past three years.
Our goal is to provide young people with the courage to imagine and 
freedom to create a healthy future for themselves while developing their critical thinking, writing, and performance skills.  And that’s all there is to it. Without your donation, many of these kids will not be able to attend the festival. We come from a rural community where drug, poverty and family issues present major challenges to our teenagers. As a mentor in our program, I 
am  inspired every day by the teenagers  who make the effort to devote their time on the weekends and after school to cultivate safe spaces and seek out opportunities to raise their voices to create change in a positive manner within our community. I encourage you to make the same effort these teens do and create positive change in our community through your support and donation. Warmly - Katie Wisnosky",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>In the winter of 2007/8 I found myself homeless and living on the streets of America - oh, happy days! However, it was during this time that I was suddenly struck with a thought, which seemingly came from nowhere: a comedic story about an average man, Albert Smith, who suddenly discovers he is the most important person ever to have lived. I spent my time scribbling the tale down on any scraps of paper I could find, throwing my all into it (basically because it enabled me to forget my miserable existence).</p>
<p>All-in-all, I spent 5 months on the streets, but I was given help by friends during this period, which I will never forget nor can I ever repay. I continued with the 'story of Smith' when my life returned to a semblance of normality, and one year later it was published.</p>
<p>My mother (an avid book reader, and book seller) refused to accept that it would never see the light of day, and so she paid for the publishing of it; without her it is possible it would never have been read by anyone.</p>
<p>I now live in Southern Germany, and will be getting married during the month of June to my wonderful fiancée, who has been a rock in my life - not least with <i>Smith</i>. Although not setting the World on fire, it is selling and has gained a small but hardcore audience, who have been demanding a sequel.</p>
<p>I am currently working on the sequel, titled <i>Nothing</i>, and this is why I am here asking for your help, so that as many people as possible can discover who Albert Smith is.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Just like with the original novel, this (eventually, but who knows when) will be published no matter what, but as with most things, money makes life easier; knowing that with your help I can definitely get it published (and far more quickly, too), but it certainly will help with the promotion of it, something I have struggled immensely with, with <i>Smith</i>.</p>
<p>Writing the original and writing the (not finished) sequel has been so rewarding - knowing I have made complete strangers laugh out loud whilst reading it, is almost satisfaction enough. But I would so love to be able to spread the word of Albert Smith to a far greater audience. I am not fooling myself that I will get a #1 New York Times best-seller, but with your help, I can publish <i>Nothing</i> and get more people laughing.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
<p>Firstly, the actual publishing of the novel: this is going to cost at least $1,200. Not cheap, granted, but they did, and are doing, such a wonderful job with <i>Smith</i>, that it would be silly not to go back to them again.</p>
<p>Secondly, the marketing of <i>Nothing</i>. This involves sending out many copies of the novel (once published) to the worldwide media (which would require me to buy them myself, hence the request), and promotional marketing (such as postcards, bookmarks, and mini rolling pins - which you will understand if you have read my first novel). Additionally, it would be great to be able to offer book-stores a bulk lot of the sequel, on a no-sale, no-fee basis. The more that is pledged, the more I can promote, so should I be fortunate enough to exceed my goal, that is where the extra money will go.</p>
<p>Thirdly, my life would be so much easier with a new (but basic) English lap-top. The one I am using now, although works, is very old and German, and I am unable to change the OS language on it (and the wi-fi doesn't work anymore either, meaning I am tied down). This isn't anywhere near as important as either of the first two requests request, so should I not reach my goal, I would continue to make do with what I have. I used to have an English one, but it died a horrible death, which was not pretty to watch.<br/></p>
<p>I have no other method of funding, because very few people even know about the existence of <i>Smith</i>, and that has always been the main problem. But in life, you should do what you love, and I refuse to give up on Albert Smith, just like he refused to give up on me the day he walked into my life.</p>
<p>I am offering plenty of perks, which you can see listed on the right - can't ask for help, if I am not offering a proper thank you, can I? Even the smallest pledge will help, every single cent counts.</p>
<p>Additionally, I am working in Euros, hence the fairly high 'Goal'.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;"">Other Ways You Can Help</span><br/></p>
</div><div>
<p>As said already, I have promoted <i>Smith</i> using essentially no money, and so Albert Smith has his own <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/storyofsmith"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">Facebook</a> page, <a href=""http://twitter.com/#!/Who_Is_Smith"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">Twitter</a> page, and, naturally, a <a href=""http://www.storyofsmith.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">website</a>, which I somehow managed to design myself (and where you will discover the book's, and my sense of humor).

Other Ways You Can Help

As said already, I have promoted Smith using essentially no money, and so Albert Smith has his own Facebook page, Twitter page, and, naturally, a website, which I somehow managed to design myself (and where you will discover the book's, and my sense of humor).

<strong>GOAL</strong><strong> </strong><strong>#3: $25,000 total funding</strong> - We'll host two on-line Q&amp;A conference calls, the first one will be geared towards writers and will talk about the craft and business side of writing.

<li>
<strong>GOAL #2: REACHED: $20,000 total funding -</strong> A number of people have been emailing and asking whether the bookmarks would be signed. Well, I hadn't planned on it, but I'm willing to take the extra effort. So, let's make that our next stretch goal shall we? <br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>GOAL #1 REACHED: $5,000 over funding ($16,360)</strong> - if we reach this level we'll make an  <i>Age of Swords</i> bookmark and it to the orders.

Now the thrilling saga continues as the human uprising is threatened by powerful enemies from without—and bitter rivalries from within.</p><p>Raithe, the God Killer, may have started the rebellion by killing a Fhrey, but long-standing enmities dividing the Rhunes make it all but impossible to unite against the common foe. And even if the clans can join forces, how will they defeat an enemy whose magical prowess renders them indistinguishable from gods?</p><p>The answer lies across the sea in a faraway land populated by a reclusive and dour race who feel nothing but disdain for both Fhrey and mankind. With time running out, Persephone leads the gifted young seer Suri, the Fhrey sorceress Arion, and a small band of misfits in a desperate search for aid—a quest that will take them into the darkest depths of Elan where an ancient adversary waits, as fearsome as it is deadly.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535292876/u1g52mspnq2sxzobyl03.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>So, that may sound great, but is the book any good?

GOAL #3: $25,000 total funding - We'll host two on-line Q&A conference calls, the first one will be geared towards writers and will talk about the craft and business side of writing. The other will be geared toward readers and talk about Michael's writing process, past works, and what's coming up in the future. We'll take questions both during and before the call, and we'll record them so people can watch even if they aren't available when they air. 

GOAL #2: REACHED: $20,000 total funding - A number of people have been emailing and asking whether the bookmarks would be signed. Well, I hadn't planned on it, but I'm willing to take the extra effort. So, let's make that our next stretch goal shall we?  

GOAL #1 REACHED: $5,000 over funding ($16,360) - if we reach this level we'll make an  Age of Swords bookmark and it to the orders. We already have an Age of Myth and an Age of War bookmark so this will complete the set (and any orders with those other books will have their corresponding bookmarks so your books and your bookmarks will match)!
So, what is this book about?  Well, here's the marketing copy from the jacket flap:In Age of Myth, fantasy master Michael J. Sullivan launched readers on an epic journey of magic and adventure, heroism and betrayal, love and loss. Now the thrilling saga continues as the human uprising is threatened by powerful enemies from without—and bitter rivalries from within.Raithe, the God Killer, may have started the rebellion by killing a Fhrey, but long-standing enmities dividing the Rhunes make it all but impossible to unite against the common foe. And even if the clans can join forces, how will they defeat an enemy whose magical prowess renders them indistinguishable from gods?The answer lies across the sea in a faraway land populated by a reclusive and dour race who feel nothing but disdain for both Fhrey and mankind. With time running out, Persephone leads the gifted young seer Suri, the Fhrey sorceress Arion, and a small band of misfits in a desperate search for aid—a quest that will take them into the darkest depths of Elan where an ancient adversary waits, as fearsome as it is deadly.So, that may sound great, but is the book any good? Well, I think so, but then again I might be a bit biased. ;-) But Age of Swords has received excellent ratings from others who have read it.  There are more than 15,000 ratings/reviews from sites such as Goodreads, Amazon, and Audible.com and more than 90% have rated it a 4- or 5-star and only 2.14% as a 1- or 2-star.But why listen to others when you can check out the books for yourself?  Here are some links to sample chapters:
Sample Chapter of Age of Myth (Book #1 of the series)
Sample Chapter of Age of Swords (Book #2 of the series)
Sample Chapter for Age of War (Book #3 of the series)
Perks for this campaign are actually pretty straightforward: a hardcover edition of Age of Swords (and other books in the series if you want them, too).Because you'll get the books directly from us, there are a number of additional perks we'll be providing to our backers.
20% discount ($22 rather than $28 for all copies of the books sold in this campaign)
All books bought through this campaign will be signed.
You'll be acknowledged on my website as one of the people making this possible.
You'll receive a free short story (Little Wren and the Big Forest).
You'll receive screen savers featuring the work of Marc Simonetti (who created the cover).
There is one perk, however, that needs a bit more explanation, and that's ""The Night in Avryln."" You see, about a year and a half ago Robin (my wife) built us a cabin in the Shenandoah Valley (near Luray VA). We've moved there full-time and are loving it. When it was built, we put in two extra guest rooms (and also have a 2-room guest suite above the carriage house). We've had lots of visitors: family, friends, fans of my writing, and other writers. If you would like to come to ""The Valley"" and hang out with us we'd love you to visit as well. And if you're a writer, we'll even critique some of your work. There are a limited number of these rewards, and you must provide your own transportation to the area, but once you arrive, we'll take care of you well. Lots of food, drink, and the guest rooms are comfy. If you want to see more images of where you'll be staying, you can click here.NOTE: You can choose your own date (we'll schedule based on first-come-first-picked), and it can be any time in 2018 or 2019. I do, however, recommend the warm months as the pool is wonderful, and there is plenty of surrounding things to do including hiking, horseback riding, canoeing, kayaking, fishing, mountain biking, tubing, zip lining, and there are also famous caves to check out.I think it's important for you to know where your hard-earned cash is going. We structured this campaign to cover only our expenses, no profit whatsoever. But after funding, I'll have extra books to sell via my website (which will provide me an income going forward).  Here's what we need the money for:
Buying the original copies from Penguin Random House
Shipping them to a fulfillment center who will package and ship the books to you
Paying for one year of storage (because I doubt I'll sell out all the copies now)
Paying Indiegogo and credit card processing fees
The cost breakdown is as follows:As for shipping fees from us to you, I have no interest in making money from that, so I set those fees to just barely cover our costs. You can click here to see how they were calculated. If you looked at the link, you'll see there is money for a fulfillment company to pick and ship the books, the shipping materials (boxes & envelopes), and the fees paid directly to the United States Postal Service. For our other crowd-funding projects, Robin used to package and ship the books herself (with the help of my daughter Sarah), but that's such a Herculean task (and she's developed wrist problems in addition to her knee and back issues), so I don't want her to do the shipping any longer.The risks for this project couldn't be smaller. Age of Swords already exists (and was produced by the largest publishing company in the world), more than 250,000 copies of books in the series have been sold, and I've already set up a fulfillment company to ship orders. All I have to do is sign the copies. I guess there is some risk that the books will be involved in a crash during transportation to the fulfillment house, but if that happens, I'll gladly refund all payments received.Oh, and just to be clear. Full funding means I buy all the books, but a partial funding means I'll buy as many books as the funds allow, but no matter what the funding level everyone who pledges WILL get their books, so no worries on that front. Well, I think that about covers everything. Oh, except to say I've run several other crowd-funding campaigns in the past and they have gone amazingly well. You can check out the comments and updates to see what the backers have to say with regard to my responsiveness and deliverability on those projects:
Disappearance of Winter's Daughter | 2,075 backers | $80,332 raised
The Death of Dulgath | 1,750 backers | $73,163 raised
Hollow World | 861 backers | $30,857 raised
I do hope you'll check out the book and help me get these hardcovers away from the price gougers and into the hands of readers at a reasonable price. As always, I thank you for your support.Oh, and if you already have the book(s), don't like hardcovers, or just don't have the funds right now, please consider sharing this campaign with your friends and family by posting through social media.",12.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p><i>Hurt by the Sun</i> is a poetry book that explores the intersection of love and loss, and the process of healing and growing. From emotions of pure joy and happiness to moments of heartbreak and sadness, these poems dive into the idea that we, as humans, aren’t defined by a single moment or event, but instead we are a collection of experiences and memories that shape who we are and who we are becoming.<br/><br/>My name is D.W. Alexander and I am the author of <i>Hurt by the Sun</i>. Over the last couple years, I’ve spent a lot of time reflecting on the process of continued personal growth and the importance of being open and vulnerable. Whether it’s in relationships, friendships or in our professional lives, being authentic helps us make connections and improve the moments we share with others. These realizations motivated me to write and publish this collection of poetry.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will feel connected to, or understood by, one of the words, phrases or poems. Each poem is an opportunity to self-reflect about your own story and your own perspective — while also lending the notion that we aren’t alone in our shared life experiences. I hope you feel inspired to tear down your own walls, and share and connect with the people in your life; so that you may feel and love fearlessly.<br/><br/>In this book, you’ll join me in using words carefully scattered on a page to evoke distinct aspects and emotions of loss, healing and the process of self-realization through poems like:</p>
<ul>
<li>“i do not remember,” which explores the challenging and painful process of finding yourself.</li>
<li>“Have you ever wept in rain?,” which explores the beauty of sadness found in the challenging moments of life.</li>
<li>“Show me true love,” which explores the integral importance of emotion, effort and honesty in relationships.</li>
<li>“Let me breathe,” which explores how we mold ourselves to fulfill the expectations of others.</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>You will enjoy this book if you appreciate moments of reflection, if you have gone through your own challenges and trials, if you love open and honest conversations, or if you are drawn to poetry.<br/><br/><i>Hurt by the Sun</i> is for anyone who has experienced love and loss, for those looking to stop the cycle of repression emotions as well as for people seeking to continually develop the practice of sharing, expressing and being vulnerable.<br/><br/>I look forward to exploring all these topics, emotions and themes with my readers.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>About the Author</h3>
<p>D. W. Alexander is a Duke University graduate currently residing in Washington, DC. He is an avid skier and sailor, Duke Basketball fanatic, and prides himself on being able to make the perfect fried egg.<br/><br/>He believes that we all strive for connection and compassion, but that we too often prevent ourselves from achieving both out of fear of being truly open and vulnerable. He maintains that by pushing through the discomfort, we are enabled to better not only the connections we share with others, but also the relationship we hold with ourselves. He wants to offer the perspective that the challenges and pain we all face in life aren’t meant to pull us down into the earth, but rather create opportunities to learn, grow and evolve into better versions of ourselves.<br/><br/>He has written poetry throughout his life and finds it the perfect medium to tackle complex emotions, feelings and experiences that can’t be fully expressed in traditional writing. Poetry allows an unfiltered, raw expression of thought and this book is his first step in sharing those ideas, images and emotions with readers. As we all progress through life, he wholeheartedly believes that it’s important to take a moment, reflect and recognize that we aren’t taking this journey alone.<br/><br/>For more information, you can connect with D.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Quite frankly I am getting tired of hearing about young people killing each other! At first it seemed as though it was something that occurred mostly in major cities with high crime rates, but now, it is an epidemic that is out of control!  It needs to stop. The only way to thwart violence is through prevention. The only way to really succeed at prevention is through a change in one's environment. But what if neither of those are an option? Or what if it is too late and a person finds themselves already locked up and shackled? The only remaining option is to free the soul and to find inner peace! But honestly, this is a difficult task when there are walls in between those who want to help and those who want to be helped.</p>
<p>Words are POWER! And I wrote these words because I am a bonafide witness as to what a change of heart and a cleansing of the soul can do for a person. Not only does it make life good, it makes life great! Bottom line is that I made it out. I was fortunate enough by the grace of God to have been given opportunities that many of my homies were not. My life has not been easy and well, it has been, let's just say...colorful. But now I have a responsibility to share with EVERYONE a path towards mortal peace that passes all understanding.</p>
<p>I have a responsibility to share an ounce of prevention through my words, through knowledge, but above all, through heaven sent wisdom. I can guarantee one thing for certain. My book has something for anyone and everyone who will pick it up and read it. That is a promise!!!</p>
<p><i>Freedom Triumphant in War and Peace</i> is a call to freedom and peace that passes all understanding. A personal freeing of the spirit that bears with it many rewards.  </p>
<p>We live in wondrous times... a time like this world has never seen. But with much change comes much uncertainty. It is time for us as people, and as a society, to return to basics or we risk losing all that we have built - including ourselves.  </p>
<p><i>Freedom Triumphant in War in Peace - The Ten Commandments: Today, Yesterday, and Tomorrow</i> is a call towards reconciliation. It is a humble call to mortal peace of the highest caliber.</p>
<p>As a contributor and partner to this project you are becoming a light that begins to shine ever brighter! <strong>By contributing to this project you will no doubt be saving a strangers life and becoming a part of their success story!</strong> You will be directly responsible for helping a total stranger find peace, and for their positive contributions to our society, where there otherwise would be no hope. This I believe with all my heart!</p>

<p>The Author</p>
<p><strong>Now, a little about me...</strong></p>
<p>I am just a simple carpenter trying to become an author.  </p>
<p>I was born and raised in the fertile Yakima Valley of Washington State. I am the son of migrant farm workers, and my story stems from poverty-stricken humble beginnings. Learning how to navigate within a dysfunctional family, domestic abuse, gang violence, and the complex dichotomy of Christianity in the ghetto, I secretly found comfort in the bosom of education and the pursuit of knowledge.  </p>
<p>Though led to believe that academic failure was my only option, I would eventually persevere and complete four college degrees, culminating in a Master of Arts degree with high honors. I proudly attribute all of my success to a deep and personal relationship with Christ; and now, I am on a mission to inspire hope!  </p>
<p>As a self-proclaimed Renaissance Man, I pride myself in being a jack-of-all trades. I am happily married to my wife Jessica, and we enjoy our peace-filled country lifestyle nestled in the Palouse of Eastern Washington State.</p>

I almost died twice beginning of this winter ('17, '18). So let's just say, if I pulled through that and continue to move forward...nothing will get in the way of me fulfilling my mission. Just being honest.</p>

As a contributor and partner to this project you are becoming a light that begins to shine ever brighter! By contributing to this project you will no doubt be saving a strangers life and becoming a part of their success story! You will be directly responsible for helping a total stranger find peace, and for their positive contributions to our society, where there otherwise would be no hope. This I believe with all my heart!

The Author
Now, a little about me...
I am just a simple carpenter trying to become an author.  
I was born and raised in the fertile Yakima Valley of Washington State. I am the son of migrant farm workers, and my story stems from poverty-stricken humble beginnings. Learning how to navigate within a dysfunctional family, domestic abuse, gang violence, and the complex dichotomy of Christianity in the ghetto, I secretly found comfort in the bosom of education and the pursuit of knowledge.  
Though led to believe that academic failure was my only option, I would eventually persevere and complete four college degrees, culminating in a Master of Arts degree with high honors. I proudly attribute all of my success to a deep and personal relationship with Christ; and now, I am on a mission to inspire hope!  
As a self-proclaimed Renaissance Man, I pride myself in being a jack-of-all trades. I am happily married to my wife Jessica, and we enjoy our peace-filled country lifestyle nestled in the Palouse of Eastern Washington State.

<h3>Made in North Korea</h3>
<p>Have you ever heard, used, or consumed a product made in North Korea? From one of the world's most closed, brutal, and repressive countries? </p>
<p>I am starting a new book project about how a Sweden-based company called Noko Jeans tried to sell jeans produced in North Korea during the end of the 2000s. The idea was to initially sell the jeans in Stockholm at the PUB Department Store. </p>
<p>This history is very interesting because it was the first and only attempt to sell North Korean-made jeans at the European market. The attempt and whole business idea gained a lot of publicity, including political debates about if it was morally right or not to sell products made in one of the world’s worst dictatorships under the control of a brutal government.</p>
<p>During the book writing process, I will focus on the following aspects:</p>
<p>- The original idea and PR</p>
<p>- The role of the North Korean embassy and government</p>
<p>- Trade 4 mining company</p>
<p>- Media publicity</p>
<p>- Political debates</p>
<p>- Documentary “Manevaurs in the Dark”</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Support and rewards </h3>
<p>In order to have more free time for writing the book, I need around 10 000 Euro. As thanks for your donations, you will receive: </p>
<p>- 5 - 10 EUR = Your name will be mentioned in the book's ""thank you list"". </p>
<p>- 10 -20 EUR: Above plus, you will be able to read exclusive content via my  Substack blog </p>
<p>- 20 EUR or more = you will receive a signed copy of the book </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>North Korea is one of the most repressive, inhumane, and brutal places in the world. One of my ambitions with the book is to analyze how much were creators of Noko Jeans aware of human rights abuses. Also, the book could become an interesting case when it comes to economic history and lessons learned from the world of business. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks </h3>
<p>During my writing process, I may get sick for a longer period because of some disease (as Covid-19). In such a case,  I will not be able to finish the book before the end of 2022.  Hopefully, things will go in accordance with to plan. </p>

Any event that makes a contribution to improved literacy, which brings schools and the wider community together, and encourages young people to read, write - and think - is a triumph. We can do this, I thought - and the adventure began.How the funds will be usedAs you can imagine there are a number of costs and logistics associated with staging such an event. We anticipate receiving around 3000 visitors to this event just this year.The project total budget is $25,000 and we are working with corporate and other sponsors and partners to help with major expenses. But your help is essential.Author and performer fees, visitor prizes, marketing, printing, photography, IT expenses, catering, marquee and other event hire, construction, audio visual needs, risk assessment requirements - these are just some of the financial challenges we need to meet.In other words, these funds will go towards all aspects of getting our school “Festival Ready” as a venue for an unforgettable event.If we smash our budget, the extra funds will be used for improving facilities, infrastructure and events for our future annual literature festivals.Big challenges!Being our inaugural Literature Festival (not our first festival, but the first in literature) and run completely by volunteers, carries its own types of challenges - time management, work commitments, event management and budget constraints to name a few - along with the challenge of encouraging event participation from a wider group than our own school community.Meeting expectations!Meeting our own expectations!However, we have been thrilled with the support and response so far to this event. Authors, publishers and many others have been fantastic in their support. All that support pushes us forward. We will make this festival happen and, with your help, we will all make a valuable cultural and educational contribution to our community.The teamDr Deborah Browne - Volunteer, Event DirectorDeborah is a strong advocate for literary education, and sees the Festival as a perfect fit for encouraging literacy, and a joy of reading. In her real job, she is an Emergency Medicine doctor; her full-time, volunteer job is as our tireless Festival Director. She reads widely, and a little bird told us she is secretly a writer, too...Julio Goncalves - Volunteer, IT DirectorJulio has some 20+ years of experience in IT and a strong hold on project management. He’s got a persistent and talkative attitude. Very talkative! His literary taste ranges from science and technology to... technology and science.Raquel Charet - School PrincipalRaquel is our in-house Montessori guru. Our Queen of Lists - she keeps us in check, feet on the ground. “Yes, just do it!” - nice to have someone that will surely tell us how it is. “Is it done already?!"". Her book preferences range from anything to anything really.Linley Caetan - Volunteer, Community SupportLinley gets straight to the point. ""Literacy is important. Who wouldn't want to support literacy?"". Master of the 45-minute meeting. He is driving our community campaign.  ""What are the next steps? When?"" Think fast!Sam - High School Student, Video ProductionHuge thanks to Sam for taking the time between classes to film and produce the video.Caroline Fonda - Crowd funding SupportMany thanks to Caroline for the initial text for this crowd funding and the ideas on perks. Nice ones!Common groundMost of us are parents at the school, some of us work here. Our bond is our commitment to make the school the best and most fulfilling place for our kids and to contribute to our broader community.Other ways you can helpOf course, the more people know about the festival the better.Spread the news!Comments, likes, shares, email, general support, tell your friends... come along!smsliteraturefestival@gmail.com",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2> The Problem</h2>
<div>
<p>In Cameroon, Africa, books are scarce--especially the good ones. Which means few Catholics have access to quality spiritual reading. Fr. Linus, who is studying at one of the Cameroon seminaries, explains:</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em>""One of the key problems the Church in Cameroon is facing, as in many parts of Africa, is that Christians do not read. And if they do, it's very thin. Most know very little about the Catholic faith and the situation is worst among the young people.""</em></p>
<p>But what if we could change that, patricularly in the seminaries? What if we could provide good Catholic books to every future-priest in the country?</p>
<p>With eBooks and new media, I think we can.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Movement</h2>
<p>Working with the seminarians themselves, we've decided the best solution is to go digital. So we're providing one CD for each seminarian in Cameroon, loaded with Catholic content that is accessible wherever he goes, regardless of the computer he's using or whether it has Internet.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.lighthousecatholicmedia.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Lighthouse Catholic Media</a> will be producing and shipping the CD's to Africa for roughly $2 per CD. That's $4,000 total, which we could have raised by working with large charities.</p>
<p>However we’ve chosen a different route.</p>
<img alt=""Africa eBook Project"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/243346/pictures/full/20120518190153-200-x-200-_6_.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right; margin: 10px;"" title=""Africa eBook Project""/><p><strong>We want this project to be an experiment in new media so</strong><strong>lidarity.</strong> We want to crowdsource this work of mercy and we want <em>you</em> to join the movement.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>For just $2, you can provide one CD for one priest, and put a ton of resources in his pocket. For just a couple bucks you can say with the rest of us, ""we"" did this, ""we"" helped make this happen.</p>
<p>It's super easy. Just click""Contribute Now"" at the top of the page and you'll join the movement within seconds.</p>
<p>Also, check out the different perks on the right which have been generously donated by our sponsors. We're sending out books, CD's, DVD's and more all to say ""thank you"" for being a part of this.</p>
<p><strong><br/></strong></p>

<h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>
<p>We definitely need money to make this happen, but even if you can't donate there are several other ways to help:</p>
<p><strong>Pray.</strong> We don't mean this flippantly. This project was birthed in prayer and continues to bathe in it, so saying a quick prayer would be huge. Prayer, after all, is more powerful than money. Please pray not just for the project's success but for all those in formation around the world.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>
<p><strong>Q: Why CDs?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Most of the Cameroon seminarians have access to computers, but Internet use is spotty at best. The CDs enable them to carry the content wherever they go, whichever computer they're on.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I have a copy of the CD?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Unfortunately, due to copyright restrictions, the CDs are only available for the seminarians in Africa. But Kevin Knight at NewAdvent.org <a href=""http://www.newadventcd.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">sells his own CD</a> for $30 that has much of the content.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What happens if you raise more than $4,000?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> If we raise more than we planned, the goal is to create even more CDs and send them to other seminarians across Africa.</p>
<p><strong>Q: When I donate, do I get *all* the perks beneath my amount?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Unfortunately, not right now. You'll only receive the perk immediately below your donation amount. So for example, if you donate $60 you'll just recceive the ""Church and New Media"" book, not the other items as well.</p>
<p><strong>Q: When will I receive my perk?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Once the campaign ends on June 30, we'll begin shipping items out. You should receive your items no later than August 1.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Special Thanks</h2>
<p>Several people helped make this project happen, but I want to especially thank <strong>Rozann Carter</strong>, Production Assistant at Word on Fire, for creating the awesome graphics. Special thanks also to <span><strong>Elliot Foley</strong> at Lighthouse Catholic Media for his patience and generosity in coordinating the shipping and logistics. And of course, thanks to <strong>Fr. Linus Patem</strong> for dreaming this whole thing up with me. You guys are awesome!</span></p>
</div>
<p> </p>
</div></div>","The Problem

In Cameroon, Africa, books are scarce--especially the good ones. Which means few Catholics have access to quality spiritual reading. Fr. Linus, who is studying at one of the Cameroon seminaries, explains:
""One of the key problems the Church in Cameroon is facing, as in many parts of Africa, is that Christians do not read. And if they do, it's very thin. Most know very little about the Catholic faith and the situation is worst among the young people.""
But what if we could change that, patricularly in the seminaries? What if we could provide good Catholic books to every future-priest in the country?
With eBooks and new media, I think we can.
 
The Movement
Working with the seminarians themselves, we've decided the best solution is to go digital. So we're providing one CD for each seminarian in Cameroon, loaded with Catholic content that is accessible wherever he goes, regardless of the computer he's using or whether it has Internet.
Lighthouse Catholic Media will be producing and shipping the CD's to Africa for roughly $2 per CD. That's $4,000 total, which we could have raised by working with large charities.
However we’ve chosen a different route.
We want this project to be an experiment in new media solidarity. We want to crowdsource this work of mercy and we want you to join the movement.


For just $2, you can provide one CD for one priest, and put a ton of resources in his pocket. For just a couple bucks you can say with the rest of us, ""we"" did this, ""we"" helped make this happen.
It's super easy. Just click""Contribute Now"" at the top of the page and you'll join the movement within seconds.
Also, check out the different perks on the right which have been generously donated by our sponsors. We're sending out books, CD's, DVD's and more all to say ""thank you"" for being a part of this.

*IMPORTANT* In order to receive a perk, choose the one you want and click the ""Claim This Perk"" button underneath it. If you just make a general donation, Indiegogo won't necessarily register you for a perk.
 


So what's on the CD?
Great question! Through the support of New Advent, Our Sunday Visitor, Aquinas and More Bookstore, and the Libreria Editrice Vatican, we've collected a ton of digital content including:

The Holy Bible in English and Latin
The complete writings of the Church fathers

The full Catholic Encyclopedia

St. Thomas Aquinas' Summa Theologiae

Several Church documents and encyclicals


Apologia Pro Vita Sua (Cardinal John Henry Newman)

Heretics (G.K. Chesterton)

How to Make Homilies Better, Briefer, and Bolder (Fr. Alfred McBride)

Lord of the World (Robert Hugh Benson)

Men of Brave Heart: The Virtue of Courage in the Priestly Life (Archbishop Jose Gomez)

Orthodoxy (G.K. Chesterton)

Pensees (Blaise Pascal)

Priests for the Third Millennium (Cardinal Timothy Dolan)
The Church and New Media (Brandon Vogt)

The Great Teachers (Pope Benedict XVI)

The Little Flowers of St. Francis (St. Francis of Assisi)

The Priest: A Bridge to God (Pope Benedict XVI)

The Spiritual Exercises (St. Ignatius of Loyola)

The Story of a Soul (St. Therese of Lisieux)

 


Other Ways You Can Help
We definitely need money to make this happen, but even if you can't donate there are several other ways to help:
Pray. We don't mean this flippantly. This project was birthed in prayer and continues to bathe in it, so saying a quick prayer would be huge. Prayer, after all, is more powerful than money. Please pray not just for the project's success but for all those in formation around the world.
Share. If you're on Facebook or Twitter, share this page with your friends and family. Just click the share buttons under the video at the top of this page. If you have your own blog or website, embed the YouTube trailer or mention the project there. You'll also find some great graphics and banners under the Gallery tab at the top of the page.

In April, 2012, I received the news that my husband was going to war.In August, my husband left for premobilization. On December 21st our son was born. On December 27 my husband flew into Afghanistan.
What followed was the hardest year of my life, as I watched my loved one complete missions in a war zone while I cuddled with our son and wondered if his daddy was going to make it home. 
Since then, I have been on a quest to understand more of the Soldier's life, from the first days of training as a recruit, to post-deployment days and the struggles of leaving the Armed Forces. I've witnessed firsthand the stress and the joys. There are moments that are downright terrifying and moments that will keep you laughing for years. 
Many Americans never get to see or understand what their heroes are doing, every single day for them. And how maybe, the heroism isn't always in the newsworthy purple medal moments (although, the sacrifice certainly is noteworthy), but rather in the day-to-day drudgery doing the work that no one else wants to with less resources than everyone else has. My passion is to share a glimpse of that by writing an essay dealing with the beginning of it all, Basic Training (The Army's version of Boot Camp), where recruits get their first taste of what it's like to be in the Army. 

This summer, I began my war novel, ""The Boy Who Lost His Enemy."" As my main character approaches enlisting and being sent to Army Basic Training, I need to know what basic training is like. So my research will be beneficial for much more than just this essay. However, In this essay let me take you to the sights, sounds and smells of recruits in the beginnings of their military journeys. 

I have been granted the opportunity to observe Army Basic Training first hand at Fort Jackson, South Carolina.


I'm eager to get my boots on the ground, so to speak, and capture the grittiness of training men and women to kill, and not die. 
What I Need & What You Get





My Trip Costs


Car Rental - $200.00 (Deemed wiser and more cost effective than taking our single family car with 100,000+ miles on it.)
Gas - $150.00 (600+ miles of driving.)
Hotel - $350.00
Food - $150.00
Total = $850
I've been able to raise $200 already. Please help me raise the remaining $650.


What You Get


You'll receive an artistic essay complete with pictures and you also get the chance to share in the making of a novel!

Contributions are processed through paypal. Feel free to use either your paypal account or a credit card. For your convenience, Paypal will process credit cards without you needing to have a Paypal account. Please let me know if you have any questions!


All funds will go towards this trip, even if the total goal is not met, OR if the funds exceed the requested amount. Being able to lengthen my stay at Fort Jackson, pay for childcare for my son and purchase a better camera would be significant help with this project! 
  The Impact 

Ever seen a soldier at the airport and been at a loss of what to do? Say thank you? Give them space to reunite with family? Stare? 
Ever seen an army duffle bag sitting next to a homeless guy on the street and wondered how it got there? How he got there?
Ever teared up at the homecoming commercials and wondered if that's what its really like? 
Ever wished others would understand what your military life was like? But been unable to explain? Ever been hurt or angered by the careless things people say and do?
Ever been shocked by the number of homeless and jobless servicemembers? Been shocked by the number who are committing suicide, every day? 
I have an inside glimpse of how war and training affects Soldiers. 
And it's not what we think. 
Men and women enlist, deploy and return home without much of America realizing or understanding the impact of war. 

But sometimes the struggles aren't from flesh wounds. Separation, high stress-levels, and rationed resources can stretch marriages to the breaking point, can cause veterans to struggle to hold down jobs, and can lead to despair and suicide. 

BASIC TRAINING IS WHERE THE MILITARY JOURNEY BEGINS.

This essay will help bridge the gap between our fighting men and women's realities and American understanding. The more we understand, the greater difference we can make. 


  Risks & Challenges


  
HURDLES

 This will be my first, but not last, significant research project, but I'm excited and preparing thoroughly. 
PAST HURDLES I'VE JUMPED


I've been a freelance writer since November 2013 and have received complements from many. My editors keep asking me when I'll have my next article ready! Visit ""Off The Grid News"" (http://www.offthegridnews.com/author/priscillas...) and ""Thalo Artist Community"" (http://www.thalo.com/articles/view/903/residenc...) to see some of my work


Researching, exploring and following fascinating leads is a passion of mine, second only to my joy in crafting words into stories (both fiction and nonfiction). This coupled with my determination to make a difference inside and outside of the military community ensures thorough research and gripping writing.

<p>The idea for this project came about when I created podcasts of some of the stories which are part of my upcoming short story collection.  The idea was to build up an audience before I finished the book.  I then realised that it would be a brilliant idea to expand this project beyond me and include work from other African writers, established and emerging.  </p>
<p>This is a non-profit venture and the podcast will be available to download for FREE from SoundCloud, iTunes and will be streamed from the project website once it has been designed.  </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The reason I'm spearheading this project is twofold. Firstly, buying books in most African  countries is considered a luxury.  Add to that, the fact that libraries are practically  non-existent.  However, technology has made access to stories and culture possible through the internet and mobile phones.  So by making these stories available online for free, it means everyone and anyone will have access to these amazing stories without having to worry about cost.  </p>
<p>Secondly, making these podcasts enables me to share the stories from the African Continent and help our writers find a wider audience.  I believe there are tons of talented writers who give up because they can't find a publisher or don't have the platform and can't find an audience.  We're fortunate that we live in an age where technology has not only made it easier, but has also made culture more accessible.  This is what I'm hoping to provide, albeit in a small way through these podcasts, the ability for African writers to reach a wider audience and for that audience to discover the next generation of great African writers.   </p> </div> <div> <h3>Why You're Needed</h3> <p>I've already started the journey by using my own short stories to create the first four podcasts, but to continue we really need your help.  Your contribution will go towards paying for:</p>

<li>Writer, Actor and Producer fees<br/>

</div></div>","Who & What I'm About Hi there and welcome to my Indigogo campaign page for raising funds to create podcasts of short stories by African writers.
The idea for this project came about when I created podcasts of some of the stories which are part of my upcoming short story collection.  The idea was to build up an audience before I finished the book.  I then realised that it would be a brilliant idea to expand this project beyond me and include work from other African writers, established and emerging.  
This is a non-profit venture and the podcast will be available to download for FREE from SoundCloud, iTunes and will be streamed from the project website once it has been designed.  


The reason I'm spearheading this project is twofold. Firstly, buying books in most African  countries is considered a luxury.  Add to that, the fact that libraries are practically  non-existent.  However, technology has made access to stories and culture possible through the internet and mobile phones.  So by making these stories available online for free, it means everyone and anyone will have access to these amazing stories without having to worry about cost.  
Secondly, making these podcasts enables me to share the stories from the African Continent and help our writers find a wider audience.  I believe there are tons of talented writers who give up because they can't find a publisher or don't have the platform and can't find an audience.  We're fortunate that we live in an age where technology has not only made it easier, but has also made culture more accessible.  This is what I'm hoping to provide, albeit in a small way through these podcasts, the ability for African writers to reach a wider audience and for that audience to discover the next generation of great African writers.      Why You're Needed I've already started the journey by using my own short stories to create the first four podcasts, but to continue we really need your help.  Your contribution will go towards paying for:

Writer, Actor and Producer fees

Website & Logo Design
Domain name & hosting
Legal fees (Writer & Actor contracts)
PR & Marketing
Recording studio costs
SoundCloud subscription
Composer

<p>In 2012, TerraProject collective, made up of 4 photographers, embarked in a 2 years journey to document the changing scenario of agricultural models in the world. With more people living in cities than in rural areas, and with growing interest by companies and corporations to invest in agricultural products, what is happening to those small-holder farmers in growing economies? What are the consequences of shifting from a family-run to an industrial farming model?<br/>Is land grabbing the only option for agricultural development?</p>
<p>We have travelled to Brazil, Dubai, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Madagascar, the Philippines and Ukraine to meet, photograph and interview investors, farmers, government officials and human rights activists.</p>
<p><b>Land Inc - The book</b></p>
<p>Our photographic work had been published by several magazines as the first and only in-depth investigation on global land issues. Now the project is becoming a book, published by <b>Editions Intervalles</b> with two editions in English and French languages, and the written contributions by <b>Cécile Cazenave</b>, who interviewed seven experts to help us understanding the story behind this phenomenon. <br/>The book, curated and designed by <b>Mónica Santos</b>, includes infographics by <b>Studioburo</b>.

<p><b>Terres à vendre - la genèse du projet</b></p>
<p>En 2012 les 4 photographes du collectif TerraProject ont entamé un voyage de deux ans pour documenter les changements des modèles agricoles dans le monde. Alors que les populations urbaines dépassent en nombre les habitants des zones rurales et avec l'intérêt croissant des investisseurs pour les produits agricoles, qu'advient-il des petites exploitations dans les pays émergents ? Quelles sont les conséquences du passage d'une agriculture familiale à un modèle industriel ?</p>
<p>L'accaparement des terres arables est-il l'unique voie de développement ?</p>
<p>Nous nous sommes rendus au Brésil, à Dubai, en Indonésie, à Madagascar, aux Philippines, en Éthiopie et en Ukraine pour rencontrer, photographier et interroger fermiers, investisseurs, représentants des gouvernements et militants des droits d'l'homme.</p>
<b>Terres à vendre - le livre</b>
<p></p>
<p>Première investigation journalistique de fond sur les enjeux globaux liés aux terres agricoles, notre travail photographique a été publié par plusieurs magazines. Le projet devient à présent un livre publié, en version française et anglaise, aux <b>Éditions Intervalles</b> . </p>

Saudis leasing thousands of hectares in Africa, US pension funds investing in the Amazon forest… a rush towards arable lands in the South is well underway. Agricultural development or neo-colonialism?

Land Inc. is a book project signed by TerraProject  and Cécile Cazenave to be published by Editions Intervalles in Fall 2016 and traces a photographic journey across Brazil, Dubai, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Madagascar, the Philippines and Ukraine to document land grabbing and the growing investments in industrial farming.Land Inc. - The background
In 2012, TerraProject collective, made up of 4 photographers, embarked in a 2 years journey to document the changing scenario of agricultural models in the world. With more people living in cities than in rural areas, and with growing interest by companies and corporations to invest in agricultural products, what is happening to those small-holder farmers in growing economies? What are the consequences of shifting from a family-run to an industrial farming model?Is land grabbing the only option for agricultural development?
We have travelled to Brazil, Dubai, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Madagascar, the Philippines and Ukraine to meet, photograph and interview investors, farmers, government officials and human rights activists.
Land Inc - The book
Our photographic work had been published by several magazines as the first and only in-depth investigation on global land issues. Now the project is becoming a book, published by Editions Intervalles with two editions in English and French languages, and the written contributions by Cécile Cazenave, who interviewed seven experts to help us understanding the story behind this phenomenon. The book, curated and designed by Mónica Santos, includes infographics by Studioburo. Cooperative PictureTank and Philippe Deblauwe have an active role in supporting and coordinating the production of the book.Book format: 16,5 × 23 cm, 140 pages, 70 photographs.The authorsTerraProject is an Italian collective of documentary photographers founded in 2006 by Michele Borzoni, Simone Donati, Pietro Paolini and Rocco Rorandelli. We are united by the desire to explore undocumented stories using a common stylistic approach. We have published 2 books, carried on 2 successful crowdfunding campaigns and won several prizes and grants including the World Press Photo (2010 and 2012), the Canon Prize (2010), the Pesaresi award for Contemporary Photograohy (2013) and the Graziadei Award (2014).Cécile Cazenave has worked extensively on environmental and sustainable development. Energy, resources, pollution, agriculture, development and consumption are at the heart of her investigations and reports. 
The campaign
With the present campaign we aim at supporting the production of the book by pre-selling copies and offering rewards that will help covering the expenses for the project. Land Inc. is the first book on land issues and will represent a landmark in the topic for years to come. This project is not just about publishing a book, but about sparkling the debate on one of the most critical issues of the century.

VERSION FRANÇAISE
Des Saoudiens qui exploitent des milliers d'hectares en Afrique, des fonds de pension américains qui investissent en Amazonie… C'est la ruée vers les terres arables du Sud. Développement agricole ou néocolonialisme ?
Le livre TERRES À VENDRE  signé TerraProject et Cécile Cazenave sortira aux Editions Intervalles fin 2016 et constitue un voyage photographique qui passe par le Brésil, Dubaï, l'Éthiopie, Madagascar, les Philippines, l'Indonésie et l'Ukraine documentant l'accaparement des terres agricoles et l'accélération des investissements dans l'agriculture industrielle.

Terres à vendre - la genèse du projet
En 2012 les 4 photographes du collectif TerraProject ont entamé un voyage de deux ans pour documenter les changements des modèles agricoles dans le monde. Alors que les populations urbaines dépassent en nombre les habitants des zones rurales et avec l'intérêt croissant des investisseurs pour les produits agricoles, qu'advient-il des petites exploitations dans les pays émergents ? Quelles sont les conséquences du passage d'une agriculture familiale à un modèle industriel ?
L'accaparement des terres arables est-il l'unique voie de développement ?
Nous nous sommes rendus au Brésil, à Dubai, en Indonésie, à Madagascar, aux Philippines, en Éthiopie et en Ukraine pour rencontrer, photographier et interroger fermiers, investisseurs, représentants des gouvernements et militants des droits d'l'homme.
Terres à vendre - le livre

<p>I've had a long career as an actor with a lot of good fortune. I won an Emmy for <i>Maggie's Secret,</i> earned a nomination for a Genie in <i>Love and Human Remains</i> directed by Denys Arcand, written by Brad Fraser; a Gemini nomination for <i>9B</i>, and  an ACTRA award nomination for the animated series, <i>Toot And Puddle</i>. In addition to my acting career, I am an activist with a passion and focus on equity issues, LGBT and women's rights. I have spent many days in protest, coffee shops, and on the streets, giving speeches about LGBT rights and raising awareness about child abuse, an issue very close to my heart. In 2004 I founded a nonprofit organization, Youth Out Loud, with the goal of raising awareness about child abuse. The annual event included a 4K march, a stage show, as well as an exhibition in Dundas Square of art and poetry created by youth who were survivors of abuse. </p>

La puerta sin voz es una de esas novelas corales en las que el lector puede escoger un protagonista o, quizás, identificarse incluso con uno o varios de ellos...
Ambientada en Salamanca, la novela trata de una familia donde el padre abusa de una hija y maltrata a su mujer; una banda de delincuentes que atracan la sucursal de una caja, un grupo de estudiantes de primero de Medicina con su alegría y sus frustraciones, unos pacientes que luchan por sobrevivir y un comisario de policía que intenta averiguar quién mató a...
Con personajes tan  diversos todos convergen tarde o temprano arrastrados por el destino.

<p class=""p1""><strong>The Book</strong></p>
<p class=""p2"">When Benjamin Grant’s son disappeared a year ago, he felt it was his duty as a father to do everything in his power to find his son, and he tried. He threw himself into the search, but his obsession left him without a home, wife, or job. Now, he’s managed to find work at the United States Postal Service’s Mail Recovery Center, which he hopes will prove an invaluable tool in his search. With the help of Sylvia—a kleptomaniac artist—Ben learns the ins and outs of a warehouse full of lost mail and explores every lead in his son’s case. But when that investigation leads him to the monster, Leonard Moscovich, Ben fears the worst.</p>
<p class=""p2""><i>Undeliverable</i> is a literary novel of 70,000 words, completed in part for my Master’s thesis at <a href=""http://www.emerson.edu/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Emerson College</a>. I graduated in May of 2011, after completing my thesis under the direction of Steve Yarbrough and Pablo Medina. Before my passion for writing led me to Emerson, I earned a B.A. in English and Psychology at <a href=""http://willamette.edu/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Willamette University</a>. My previous publications including a handful of short stories, creative non-fiction pieces and poetry in various online and print journals and I have worked with various publications such as <i><a href=""http://www.redividerjournal.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Redivider</a></i> at Emerson and <i><a href=""http://unstuckbooks.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Unstuck</a></i>.</p>
<p class=""p2"">I chose to go the crowd-funded route instead of pursuing traditional publishing for two reasons. First, I disliked the amount of control I had to give up to the publishing houses and the amount of rights I would basically have to forfeit as a first time author. Secondly, I found the industry oddly reticent to back a book where a portion of the proceeds were going to charity, and that was something I was determined to do. $1 from each sale is donated directly to the <a href=""http://www.missingkids.com/home"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.missingkids.com/home"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">National Center for Missing and Exploited Children</a>, so while you join Ben on his journey to find his son, you're also helping families across the country find their own missing children. And yes, for every person who donates at the $25 dollar level and above during this campaign, a dollar will be donated to the Center.</p>

<p>“Undeliverable delivers a range of pleasures to its readers: a unique and fascinating setting, an urgent mystery, a cast of oddball characters, sharp and witty dialogue. But what makes it compelling above all else is its heartfelt exploration of one man’s grief and determination in the face of his son’s disappearance.

The Book
When Benjamin Grant’s son disappeared a year ago, he felt it was his duty as a father to do everything in his power to find his son, and he tried. He threw himself into the search, but his obsession left him without a home, wife, or job. Now, he’s managed to find work at the United States Postal Service’s Mail Recovery Center, which he hopes will prove an invaluable tool in his search. With the help of Sylvia—a kleptomaniac artist—Ben learns the ins and outs of a warehouse full of lost mail and explores every lead in his son’s case. But when that investigation leads him to the monster, Leonard Moscovich, Ben fears the worst.
Undeliverable is a literary novel of 70,000 words, completed in part for my Master’s thesis at Emerson College. I graduated in May of 2011, after completing my thesis under the direction of Steve Yarbrough and Pablo Medina. Before my passion for writing led me to Emerson, I earned a B.A. in English and Psychology at Willamette University. My previous publications including a handful of short stories, creative non-fiction pieces and poetry in various online and print journals and I have worked with various publications such as Redivider at Emerson and Unstuck.
I chose to go the crowd-funded route instead of pursuing traditional publishing for two reasons. First, I disliked the amount of control I had to give up to the publishing houses and the amount of rights I would basically have to forfeit as a first time author. Secondly, I found the industry oddly reticent to back a book where a portion of the proceeds were going to charity, and that was something I was determined to do. $1 from each sale is donated directly to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, so while you join Ben on his journey to find his son, you're also helping families across the country find their own missing children. And yes, for every person who donates at the $25 dollar level and above during this campaign, a dollar will be donated to the Center.


What people are saying about Undeliverable:
“Undeliverable delivers a range of pleasures to its readers: a unique and fascinating setting, an urgent mystery, a cast of oddball characters, sharp and witty dialogue. But what makes it compelling above all else is its heartfelt exploration of one man’s grief and determination in the face of his son’s disappearance. We yearn for Ben to find his missing boy, but even more, we want him to find a path to fulfillment in a world full of trouble. In Rebecca Demarest’s hands, his journey is tense, thrilling, and deeply satisfying.”          - Scott Nadelson, author of Saving Stanley and The Cantor’s Daughter

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>A while back, Manuel and Molly appeared in my apartment. They're both sentient plush animals, apparently from a parallel universe (Earth-33, to be precise). Manuel is a lobster, and Molly is a sheep: Manuel's BFF, and also his accountant. </p>
<p>Since February 2017, Manuel has made it impossible for me to socialize, have a relationship, or even enjoy a quiet evening at home. From using my credit card to buy ""anti-prawn devices"" (read: cocktail umbrellas), to jumping out of the drawer and scaring the living daylights out of EVERY SINGLE DATE who comes over, my level of done with Manuel is very high. </p>
<p>With Molly's help, I figured out how to get rid of Manuel. </p>
<p>Apparently, Manuel can only return to Earth-33 if this book is read by at least 420 people. </p>
<p>I need your help to do this. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>These are some other reasons why I'm writing and publishing this book:</p>
<ul>
<li>I am a Cylon, and my Cylon therapist said I should publish a book. Do you have any idea how much worse anxiety is with countless copies of yourself out there?</li>
<li>Manuel (the lobster) will not shut up until I publish this book, because everything is always about him. ALL THE TIME.</li>
<li>I will be eternally grateful to you for ending the current misery of waking up to feel Manuel's grubby, furry lobster claws on my face, pestering me about writing and publishing his story.</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>(Manuel also likes throwing loud parties and inviting questionable wildlife into my home, including very drunk mermaids. And no, he does not pay rent.)<br/><br/>Please, <i>please</i> help me get rid of this dratted crustacean once and for all.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Apart from my sanity, this is what I need:</p>
<ul>
<li>I need at least 420 people to read this book. According to Molly, this is the magic number that's needed for them to go back to Earth-33, where Manuel will presumably continue to pester my Earth-33 counterpart.</li>
<li>Dear Earth-33 version of me, I apologize in advance, but I need my life back. <strong>#sorrynotsorry</strong>
</li>
<li>The dazzling array of perks I have laid out include being featured in the book (using your own name or a character name of your choice). This is an excellent opportunity to be a part of inter-parallel universe travel <i>without</i> the help of psychotropic substances. It's also cheaper, hooray!</li>
<li>
<strong>What you get: </strong>Apart from the perk you've purchased, all backers will be mentioned in the acknowledgment section, with your preferred name. You can make up a name if you like, but please don't make me say ""Thanks, Khaleesi!"" 7 times on one page. </li>
<li>
<strong>The story:</strong> You'll find out how on earth Manuel arrived here at Earth-42, and the palaver that my predecessor on Earth-11, Penny Lane, had to go through to get rid of him. (Yes, that is really her name.) </li>
<li>You'll get updates throughout the campaign, mostly about how Manuel is continuing to make my life a misery. </li>
<li>
<strong>Post-campaign:</strong> you'll get updates on the book production, as well as delightful visual anecdotes of how Manuel is cheerfully continuing to ruin my life.</li>
<li>
<strong>Where the funds go if I exceed my basic and stretch goals: </strong>From whatever's left after covering my basic and stretch goal costs, 11% will go to a literacy NGO that you, the backers, will choose via a poll. The rest will go towards offsetting the enormous debt that Manuel has racked up on my credit cards, along with more sessions with my Cylon therapist.</li>
<li>Oh, you wanted numbers? Okay then. Molly has some numbers for you.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Basic goal</strong>:<ul>
<li>Interior layout for ebook and print, cover design, print costs for backer copies and distribution on all major online retailers: USD $1,400</li>
<li>A Goodreads giveaway for 42 print copies: USD $600</li>
<li><strong>Total: USD $2,000</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Stretch goal</strong> (up to USD $8,000)<ul>
<li>Everything in the basic goal plus:</li>
<li>Developmental editing so that more people will enjoy reading this book, review it positively, and tell people about it, thus getting me closer to the minimum goal of 420 readers needed to rid myself of this meddlesome lobster: USD $4,400</li>
<li>Marketing budget boost, spread out over 3 months: USD $1,200</li>
<li>Sending copies of the book to 30 book bloggers and reviewers, including printing and shipping: USD $400</li>
<li><strong>Total: USD $8,000</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This is how your contribution will help me and other people on Earth-42:</p>
<ul>
<li>SRSLY PLEASE, help me out. Manuel has ruined about 83 dates (and counting) for me already. He keeps appearing at awkward times and throwing his voice from the drawer that I've stuffed him in. A squeaky voice yelling ""Kill the prawns!"" in the middle of a make-out session is <i>super</i> not fun. Believe me.</li>
<li>^^There was one time Manuel did this when I was about to get erm, romantic with a guy who looked exactly like Pedro Pascal. I never saw NotPedro again (after he fled, screaming). <i>Do you have any idea how difficult it is to find a Pedro Pascal lookalike in Singapore?</i>
</li>
<li>This is my first time crowdfunding. Not my first time writing a book, though. (You can read it <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Blood-Moon-Daywalker-Chronicles-Book-ebook/dp/B00HQLKBGY/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.)</li>
<li>You can trust me to get rid of the lobster once I hit the 420-reader target. Bye, Manuel!</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>These are the risks and challenges in my quest to remove Manuel from my life and my apartment:</p>
<ul><li>If Manuel had told me about the 420-reader threshold, this campaign would be moot, because he would totally be lying. However, Molly has verified that this is the magic number needed for both the creatures to go back to Earth-33, so I think we're good.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you know anyone who can travel to parallel universes, remember: sharing is caring!</li>
<li>If you don't know a parallel universe traveller, please share this campaign anyway.</li>
<li>If funding this campaign isn't your thing, that's fine. All I ask is that you read  and review the book when it's published, so that the confounded crustacean can be on his way back to Earth-33 yesterday. </li>

One of her heels was threatening to abscond forever, and it was about two wobbles away from breaking. Penny thought about the annoying ads for mints which contained unnecessary amounts of cheeriness and impractical advice about shoe-related emergencies, and wondered exactly what narcotics the models had been on.</p><p>“Miss! I have a message for you!” someone babbled behind her. A clammy hand landed on her shoulder. It was so slippery with sweat that Penny managed to shrug her way out of the unwanted contact almost instantly.</p><p>She spun on her heel, which broke — presumably out of sheer spite. The apparent owner of the clammy hand was a man in his twenties who looked about as high as one can get without being dead.</p><p>“I don’t want the message. Go <i>away</i>!” Penny snarled. The effect of her hostility was somewhat ruined as she awkwardly balanced on one leg to break off the offending heel — just like in those implausible mint ads. She wanted to scream, but the front of the frozen yoghurt shop was possibly not the place to do this. There were several children there, and they looked like the sort that might join in for the fun of it.</p><p>The man’s pupils were the size of saucers. He looked like he might have some complex theories about saucer deities as well. “But I just wanted to sing for you!” he said, looking slightly hurt.</p><p>Penny Lane gritted her teeth. “I see. Well, I’m not really a fan of musicals. I’m really late for work, so I’ll just-”</p><p>“STRAWBERRY FIELDS FOREVERRRRRR!” the man shrieked. Even the most charitable human in the world could not truthfully term this as ‘singing’. No, it was nowhere close to singing. It was more of a horrid banshee wail so awful that it had probably ripped a hole in the space-time continuum. Or at least, Penny thought so. This might seem an unkind assessment, but Penny Lane had been subjected to a ridiculous number of unimaginative Beatles-related jokes, puns, and comments about her name for twenty-four years. What made it even worse was the fact that she actually liked their music, but years of wordplay-induced trauma had made her unable to listen to an entire Beatles song without throwing up.</p><p>“Look!” she said, feigning excitement. “It’s a giant lollipop in the sky!”</p><p>The man turned away to look for the giant lollipop. Penny fled the scene.</p><p> </p><p align=""center"">***</p><p> </p><p>The moment Penny walked into the office, she understood that she had made a colossal, costly error.</p><p>She had entirely forgotten about Friday Funday at the office.</p><p>Friday Fundays were the demented brainchild of her boss, Mr Eddy Eddington. For some reason, he thought that forcing all his employees to wear costumes for a different theme every Friday was a good idea. Savage words like ‘team morale’ and ‘interdepartmental dynamics’ had been thrown around recklessly in several agonising meetings about Friday Fundays. How exactly this would help a team of seven people at a paperclip distribution company was a mystery for the ages.</p><p>Today wasn’t just any Friday Funday. <i>It was the Beatles-themed Friday Funday. </i></p><p>Bob from Marketing greeted Penny with a level of enthusiasm bordering on insanity. Penny considered his incessant cheerfulness a grave personal insult, and made the effort to be laconic when interacting with him.</p><p>“Penny! We renamed the goldfish!” Bob said, almost vibrating with joy.</p><p><i>No</i>, thought Penny. <i>Please don’t say it. Don’t</i>-</p><p>“We named them John, Paul, George, and Ringo!” Bob giggled. He then skipped off to torture someone else in the office with his excessive happiness.</p><p>Penny surveyed the scene in the office while a silent scream began in her head. It did not stop: the office had turned into her personal hell. There were about four Ringo Starrs, one Yoko Ono, and Beatles-themed decorations everywhere.</p><p>Miranda from Sales swanned over to the receptionist’s desk. She was dressed as Yoko Ono, and inexplicably, was wearing dramatic fake eyelashes that were compromising her center of gravity.</p><p>“Penny!” she squealed. “Darling, you poor <i>thing</i>! Did you <i>forget</i> about this week’s theme?”</p><p>Penny wondered, not for the first time, if there was a supply of Prozac in the office pantry that no one had told her about. Miranda blinked rapidly at her, causing a very small breeze.</p><p>“Miranda, I think Paul is flirting with the intern again,” Penny said, edging towards the cover of her reception desk. Miranda’s head swiveled towards a gaggle of Paul McCartneys.</p><p>“Which Paul? Paul, Paul or one of the McCartneys?” Miranda asked.</p><p>At this point, Penny Lane mentally ran through a number of ways to escape this nightmare, some more violent than others. It took her about three seconds, and these were her options:</p><p> </p><p><i>One: Curl up into a small ball under my reception desk and go unnoticed until lunch hour.</i></p><p><i>Two: Bribe the security guards to activate the building’s fire alarm.</i></p><p><i>Three: Dramatically announce a fake plot twist to the half-eaten sandwich conspiracy from last Thursday, and slip away in the chaos.</i></p><p><i>Four: Simply walk out of the door, and face the consequences on Monday.</i></p><p><i>Five: Use all of the very sharp pencils in my stationery supply box to stab everyone, and somehow flee without getting eventually arrested.</i></p><p><i>Six: Pretend I’m going to get everyone coffee and doughnuts from the bakery, and just go home instead.</i></p><p> </p><p>Penny didn’t really have the stomach or the motor skills coordination for option five. Just as she was weighing the pros and cons of the doughnut gambit versus the sandwich conspiracy plan, the phone at her desk rang.</p><p>With chirpiness that she didn’t know she possessed, Penny answered the phone. “Good morning, this is The Accidental Paperclip Company,” she trilled. “Penny Lane speaking, how may I help you?”</p><p>A woman on the other end of the line yawned before replying. “Yeah, I’m calling from the Angel of Mercy Hospital about Eddy Eddington. Penny Lane — you’re his next of kin, right?”</p><p>Penny blinked rapidly. “Er, I’m n-” she began, before the gears in her mind started whirring. “Yes, I am. What’s happened?”</p><p>“Coconuts,” the woman said.</p><p>“<i>What</i>?” Penny said. She was having trouble hearing the woman, as one of the Ringos was now serenading Ringo the goldfish, singing “<i>I wanna hoooold youurrr fin</i>,” at an unreasonable decibel.</p><p>“Collided with a truck of coconuts. We need you to come to the hospital and sign some forms,” the woman said, stifling another mighty yawn. “It’s urgent,” she added.</p><p>“I see. I’ll be there in thirty minutes. Bye,” Penny said. She tried not to sound happy about this, but failed. She grabbed her handbag and headed for the door, wondering if she should still try the sandwich conspiracy option, just to shake things up a little.</p><p>“Emergency, can’t talk, see you on Monday,” she said to no-one in particular. Penny Lane smiled as the office door swung shut and the voices of her bewildered colleagues faded into silence.</p><p> </p><p align=""center"">***</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, just sign here,” the nurse said, thrusting a clipboard at Penny. She glanced at the form, then at the inert figure on the hospital bed. Eddy Eddington was lying there with his eyes wide open, seemingly unresponsive to any stimuli. The next bed was empty, unless you counted a plush sheep and a slightly grubby plush lobster.</p><p>“Hang on, are you very sure he’s brain-dead?” Penny asked. She couldn’t quite believe the words coming out of her mouth, as she had often wondered about Mr. Eddington’s brain activity; i.e. if there was any activity at all, and how he managed life in general when he was far less intelligent than a slice of bread.</p><p>The nurse shrugged. “He’s passed all the tests. Or failed them, depending on how you look at it.”</p><p>Penny edged closer to Eddy Eddington and decided to do something quite cruel.</p><p>There are a few possible reasons for what she did next, and some of them are unsavory. It could have been the sheer volume of Beatles-related trauma. It could have been an allergic reaction to the young man who had attempted to sing to her. It could have been pent-up rage from a relentless onslaught of Friday Fundays, each theme more annoying than the next — particularly if one took public transport to work. It could have been the memory of the cactus-themed Friday Funday that pushed Penny over the edge. It was also possible that Penny was trying to confirm that Eddy Eddington was truly brain-dead (in the medical sense, at least).</p><p>Penny knew that Eddy Eddington had a phobia of plush toys. She even knew why: it had something to do with an office Christmas party several years ago, a singing telegram messenger in a bear costume, a traumatic breakup, and obscene quantities of very cheap tequila.</p><p>Penny knew that he was violently terrified of plush animals. So she placed the plush lobster and sheep on his hospital bed, very slowly and deliberately. And she waited.</p><p>She waited for the screams, the uncontrollable shivering, the tears, but there was … nothing. There was simply a shell of a man who held the dubious honor of having been the most annoying human on the planet.</p><p>Penny wanted to feel sorry for him, she really did. She tried. But she simply couldn’t.</p><p>She could, however, sign the form ensuring that he received adequate healthcare, should he wake up within the next 48 hours — an extremely unlikely situation, given his lack of a reaction to the lobster and the sheep.</p><p>A tiny pinprick of guilt stopped her just before she signed the form. “Are you sure you don’t need my ID?”</p><p>The nurse blew a large, purple bubble. It popped, and he continued chewing. “Nah,” he said. “I mean, why would anyone pretend to be his relative?”</p><p>Penny had to admit that the nurse made a good point. She signed the document, half-expecting Eddy Eddington to spring to life moments later.

A while back, Manuel and Molly appeared in my apartment. They're both sentient plush animals, apparently from a parallel universe (Earth-33, to be precise). Manuel is a lobster, and Molly is a sheep: Manuel's BFF, and also his accountant. 
Since February 2017, Manuel has made it impossible for me to socialize, have a relationship, or even enjoy a quiet evening at home. From using my credit card to buy ""anti-prawn devices"" (read: cocktail umbrellas), to jumping out of the drawer and scaring the living daylights out of EVERY SINGLE DATE who comes over, my level of done with Manuel is very high. 
With Molly's help, I figured out how to get rid of Manuel. 
Apparently, Manuel can only return to Earth-33 if this book is read by at least 420 people. 
I need your help to do this. 
 
These are some other reasons why I'm writing and publishing this book:

I am a Cylon, and my Cylon therapist said I should publish a book. Do you have any idea how much worse anxiety is with countless copies of yourself out there?
Manuel (the lobster) will not shut up until I publish this book, because everything is always about him. ALL THE TIME.
I will be eternally grateful to you for ending the current misery of waking up to feel Manuel's grubby, furry lobster claws on my face, pestering me about writing and publishing his story.

(Manuel also likes throwing loud parties and inviting questionable wildlife into my home, including very drunk mermaids. And no, he does not pay rent.)Please, please help me get rid of this dratted crustacean once and for all.
 

What I Need & What You Get
Apart from my sanity, this is what I need:

I need at least 420 people to read this book. According to Molly, this is the magic number that's needed for them to go back to Earth-33, where Manuel will presumably continue to pester my Earth-33 counterpart.
Dear Earth-33 version of me, I apologize in advance, but I need my life back. #sorrynotsorry

The dazzling array of perks I have laid out include being featured in the book (using your own name or a character name of your choice). This is an excellent opportunity to be a part of inter-parallel universe travel without the help of psychotropic substances. It's also cheaper, hooray!

What you get: Apart from the perk you've purchased, all backers will be mentioned in the acknowledgment section, with your preferred name. You can make up a name if you like, but please don't make me say ""Thanks, Khaleesi!"" 7 times on one page. 

The story: You'll find out how on earth Manuel arrived here at Earth-42, and the palaver that my predecessor on Earth-11, Penny Lane, had to go through to get rid of him. (Yes, that is really her name.) 
You'll get updates throughout the campaign, mostly about how Manuel is continuing to make my life a misery. 

Post-campaign: you'll get updates on the book production, as well as delightful visual anecdotes of how Manuel is cheerfully continuing to ruin my life.

Where the funds go if I exceed my basic and stretch goals: From whatever's left after covering my basic and stretch goal costs, 11% will go to a literacy NGO that you, the backers, will choose via a poll. The rest will go towards offsetting the enormous debt that Manuel has racked up on my credit cards, along with more sessions with my Cylon therapist.
Oh, you wanted numbers? Okay then. Molly has some numbers for you.

 


Basic goal:
Interior layout for ebook and print, cover design, print costs for backer copies and distribution on all major online retailers: USD $1,400
A Goodreads giveaway for 42 print copies: USD $600
Total: USD $2,000



Stretch goal (up to USD $8,000)
Everything in the basic goal plus:
Developmental editing so that more people will enjoy reading this book, review it positively, and tell people about it, thus getting me closer to the minimum goal of 420 readers needed to rid myself of this meddlesome lobster: USD $4,400
Marketing budget boost, spread out over 3 months: USD $1,200
Sending copies of the book to 30 book bloggers and reviewers, including printing and shipping: USD $400
Total: USD $8,000



 

The Impact
This is how your contribution will help me and other people on Earth-42:

SRSLY PLEASE, help me out. Manuel has ruined about 83 dates (and counting) for me already. He keeps appearing at awkward times and throwing his voice from the drawer that I've stuffed him in. A squeaky voice yelling ""Kill the prawns!"" in the middle of a make-out session is super not fun. Believe me.
^^There was one time Manuel did this when I was about to get erm, romantic with a guy who looked exactly like Pedro Pascal. I never saw NotPedro again (after he fled, screaming). Do you have any idea how difficult it is to find a Pedro Pascal lookalike in Singapore?

This is my first time crowdfunding. Not my first time writing a book, though. (You can read it here.)
You can trust me to get rid of the lobster once I hit the 420-reader target. Bye, Manuel!

 

Risks & Challenges
These are the risks and challenges in my quest to remove Manuel from my life and my apartment:
If Manuel had told me about the 420-reader threshold, this campaign would be moot, because he would totally be lying. However, Molly has verified that this is the magic number needed for both the creatures to go back to Earth-33, so I think we're good.
 

Other Ways You Can Help

If you know anyone who can travel to parallel universes, remember: sharing is caring!
If you don't know a parallel universe traveller, please share this campaign anyway.
If funding this campaign isn't your thing, that's fine. All I ask is that you read  and review the book when it's published, so that the confounded crustacean can be on his way back to Earth-33 yesterday.

So long, and thanks for all the fish. * * *  Extract from Manuel And Molly Find Earth-42 Chapter 1: Implausible Coconuts Penny Lane was not happy.She was late for work, and it was a drippy, dreary Friday. One of her heels was threatening to abscond forever, and it was about two wobbles away from breaking. Penny thought about the annoying ads for mints which contained unnecessary amounts of cheeriness and impractical advice about shoe-related emergencies, and wondered exactly what narcotics the models had been on.“Miss! I have a message for you!” someone babbled behind her. A clammy hand landed on her shoulder. It was so slippery with sweat that Penny managed to shrug her way out of the unwanted contact almost instantly.She spun on her heel, which broke — presumably out of sheer spite. The apparent owner of the clammy hand was a man in his twenties who looked about as high as one can get without being dead.“I don’t want the message. Go away!” Penny snarled. The effect of her hostility was somewhat ruined as she awkwardly balanced on one leg to break off the offending heel — just like in those implausible mint ads. She wanted to scream, but the front of the frozen yoghurt shop was possibly not the place to do this. There were several children there, and they looked like the sort that might join in for the fun of it.The man’s pupils were the size of saucers. He looked like he might have some complex theories about saucer deities as well. “But I just wanted to sing for you!” he said, looking slightly hurt.Penny Lane gritted her teeth. “I see. Well, I’m not really a fan of musicals. I’m really late for work, so I’ll just-”“STRAWBERRY FIELDS FOREVERRRRRR!” the man shrieked. Even the most charitable human in the world could not truthfully term this as ‘singing’. No, it was nowhere close to singing. It was more of a horrid banshee wail so awful that it had probably ripped a hole in the space-time continuum. Or at least, Penny thought so. This might seem an unkind assessment, but Penny Lane had been subjected to a ridiculous number of unimaginative Beatles-related jokes, puns, and comments about her name for twenty-four years. What made it even worse was the fact that she actually liked their music, but years of wordplay-induced trauma had made her unable to listen to an entire Beatles song without throwing up.“Look!” she said, feigning excitement. “It’s a giant lollipop in the sky!”The man turned away to look for the giant lollipop. Penny fled the scene. *** The moment Penny walked into the office, she understood that she had made a colossal, costly error.She had entirely forgotten about Friday Funday at the office.Friday Fundays were the demented brainchild of her boss, Mr Eddy Eddington. For some reason, he thought that forcing all his employees to wear costumes for a different theme every Friday was a good idea. Savage words like ‘team morale’ and ‘interdepartmental dynamics’ had been thrown around recklessly in several agonising meetings about Friday Fundays. How exactly this would help a team of seven people at a paperclip distribution company was a mystery for the ages.Today wasn’t just any Friday Funday. It was the Beatles-themed Friday Funday. Bob from Marketing greeted Penny with a level of enthusiasm bordering on insanity. Penny considered his incessant cheerfulness a grave personal insult, and made the effort to be laconic when interacting with him.“Penny! We renamed the goldfish!” Bob said, almost vibrating with joy.No, thought Penny. Please don’t say it. Don’t-“We named them John, Paul, George, and Ringo!” Bob giggled. He then skipped off to torture someone else in the office with his excessive happiness.Penny surveyed the scene in the office while a silent scream began in her head. It did not stop: the office had turned into her personal hell. There were about four Ringo Starrs, one Yoko Ono, and Beatles-themed decorations everywhere.Miranda from Sales swanned over to the receptionist’s desk. She was dressed as Yoko Ono, and inexplicably, was wearing dramatic fake eyelashes that were compromising her center of gravity.“Penny!” she squealed. “Darling, you poor thing! Did you forget about this week’s theme?”Penny wondered, not for the first time, if there was a supply of Prozac in the office pantry that no one had told her about. Miranda blinked rapidly at her, causing a very small breeze.“Miranda, I think Paul is flirting with the intern again,” Penny said, edging towards the cover of her reception desk. Miranda’s head swiveled towards a gaggle of Paul McCartneys.“Which Paul? Paul, Paul or one of the McCartneys?” Miranda asked.At this point, Penny Lane mentally ran through a number of ways to escape this nightmare, some more violent than others. It took her about three seconds, and these were her options: One: Curl up into a small ball under my reception desk and go unnoticed until lunch hour.Two: Bribe the security guards to activate the building’s fire alarm.Three: Dramatically announce a fake plot twist to the half-eaten sandwich conspiracy from last Thursday, and slip away in the chaos.Four: Simply walk out of the door, and face the consequences on Monday.Five: Use all of the very sharp pencils in my stationery supply box to stab everyone, and somehow flee without getting eventually arrested.Six: Pretend I’m going to get everyone coffee and doughnuts from the bakery, and just go home instead. Penny didn’t really have the stomach or the motor skills coordination for option five. Just as she was weighing the pros and cons of the doughnut gambit versus the sandwich conspiracy plan, the phone at her desk rang.With chirpiness that she didn’t know she possessed, Penny answered the phone. “Good morning, this is The Accidental Paperclip Company,” she trilled. “Penny Lane speaking, how may I help you?”A woman on the other end of the line yawned before replying. “Yeah, I’m calling from the Angel of Mercy Hospital about Eddy Eddington. Penny Lane — you’re his next of kin, right?”Penny blinked rapidly. “Er, I’m n-” she began, before the gears in her mind started whirring. “Yes, I am. What’s happened?”“Coconuts,” the woman said.“What?” Penny said. She was having trouble hearing the woman, as one of the Ringos was now serenading Ringo the goldfish, singing “I wanna hoooold youurrr fin,” at an unreasonable decibel.“Collided with a truck of coconuts. We need you to come to the hospital and sign some forms,” the woman said, stifling another mighty yawn. “It’s urgent,” she added.“I see. I’ll be there in thirty minutes. Bye,” Penny said. She tried not to sound happy about this, but failed. She grabbed her handbag and headed for the door, wondering if she should still try the sandwich conspiracy option, just to shake things up a little.“Emergency, can’t talk, see you on Monday,” she said to no-one in particular. Penny Lane smiled as the office door swung shut and the voices of her bewildered colleagues faded into silence. *** “Yeah, just sign here,” the nurse said, thrusting a clipboard at Penny. She glanced at the form, then at the inert figure on the hospital bed. Eddy Eddington was lying there with his eyes wide open, seemingly unresponsive to any stimuli. The next bed was empty, unless you counted a plush sheep and a slightly grubby plush lobster.“Hang on, are you very sure he’s brain-dead?” Penny asked. She couldn’t quite believe the words coming out of her mouth, as she had often wondered about Mr. Eddington’s brain activity; i.e. if there was any activity at all, and how he managed life in general when he was far less intelligent than a slice of bread.The nurse shrugged. “He’s passed all the tests. Or failed them, depending on how you look at it.”Penny edged closer to Eddy Eddington and decided to do something quite cruel.There are a few possible reasons for what she did next, and some of them are unsavory. It could have been the sheer volume of Beatles-related trauma. It could have been an allergic reaction to the young man who had attempted to sing to her. It could have been pent-up rage from a relentless onslaught of Friday Fundays, each theme more annoying than the next — particularly if one took public transport to work. It could have been the memory of the cactus-themed Friday Funday that pushed Penny over the edge. It was also possible that Penny was trying to confirm that Eddy Eddington was truly brain-dead (in the medical sense, at least).Penny knew that Eddy Eddington had a phobia of plush toys. She even knew why: it had something to do with an office Christmas party several years ago, a singing telegram messenger in a bear costume, a traumatic breakup, and obscene quantities of very cheap tequila.Penny knew that he was violently terrified of plush animals. So she placed the plush lobster and sheep on his hospital bed, very slowly and deliberately. And she waited.She waited for the screams, the uncontrollable shivering, the tears, but there was … nothing. There was simply a shell of a man who held the dubious honor of having been the most annoying human on the planet.Penny wanted to feel sorry for him, she really did. She tried. But she simply couldn’t.She could, however, sign the form ensuring that he received adequate healthcare, should he wake up within the next 48 hours — an extremely unlikely situation, given his lack of a reaction to the lobster and the sheep.A tiny pinprick of guilt stopped her just before she signed the form. “Are you sure you don’t need my ID?”The nurse blew a large, purple bubble. It popped, and he continued chewing. “Nah,” he said. “I mean, why would anyone pretend to be his relative?”Penny had to admit that the nurse made a good point. She signed the document, half-expecting Eddy Eddington to spring to life moments later. He did no such thing, and instead, was wheeled off to another section promptly.If Penny hadn’t had such a strange day, she might have caught a very important detail: the plush lobster and the sheep weren’t on Eddy Eddington’s bed when the orderly whisked him away.As she walked down the hospital corridor, Penny conceded that it hadn’t been such a terrible day after all. She promptly revised this opinion after a burly nurse bumped into her and hurried off without an apology. She thought she heard him saying “prawns” in a squeaky voice as he skulked off, but that made no sense at all.Somewhere near the radiology wing, Penny heard the squeaky voice again. “Prawns!” She stopped walking. It was entirely possible that her day had been stressful enough to cause auditory hallucinations, although she’d never had any before.Penny dashed into the first bathroom she saw. She put her handbag down on the next sink and splashed her face with water.“All right, Penny, pull yourself together,” she said out loud. Thankfully, her reflection did not respond.Instead, the clasp of her handbag popped open. This time, she heard it clearly. Someone — or something — squeaked from her bag, “Kill the prawns!”There was a shushing noise, and then a slightly trembling voice said, “Manuel, be quiet!”At this point, Penny was more curious than she was afraid. She was also considering the possibility of a visit to the psychiatric wing in the hospital, but it was a vague possibility.She reached out for her handbag, because saying “Hello? Who’s there?” the way characters do in horror movies was just silly. She peered into her handbag and saw one gleaming eye first. Then another, and finally, two pairs of eyes, staring back at her nervously.The plush lobster and the sheep were in her bag.The sheep cleared its throat. “I’m so very sorry to trouble you, miss,” the sheep said, “but it appears that my calculations have gone rather awry.

<p><strong>Background on Tango the Tangeroo Stories</strong></p>
<p>“The Tales of Tango – The Tangaroo” is a three part series of children’s books that were self-published back in the late 1990’s.  First there was “The Tales of Tango –The Brave Lesson”. The story was located in Australia. The moral lesson was “Don’t be afraid to follow your dreams, no matter how strange or silly they seem! Dreams have a way to talking to you, believe in yourself and make them come true!"" This origin story book was brought to the attention of Lady Diana, Princess of Wales as a birthday gift to her two sons, Prince William and Prince Harry. In return, a kind thank you letter followed from her royal highness from Kensington Palace.</p>

<p>The third story was titled, “The Tales of Tango – The Fair of the Pharaohs” which was about traveling to Egypt and being fair and not to discriminate against others. A wonderful quote from this book was, “Green or blue, short or tall, to be fair to one, you must be fair to all. ” Due to lack of funds, this was the last book that was self-published.</p>

<p>I'm Ellyn Touchette, from Portland, Maine.</p>
<p>I'm a first-year Bioengineering student at the University of Maine in Orono and I am a POET. I like roller derby and baby goats.</p>
<p>I've been writing ever since I was literate and attending poetry slams since I was fourteen. At the end of my senior year at Gorham High School, I became Port Veritas' 2012 Youth Slam champion and a member of the first all female state slam team. I am qualified to compete in Port Veritas' upcoming semi-final slam for a spot on their nationally recognized 2013 slam team. In November, I released my first chapbook, <em>Dead Was the Machine</em> God, at Rhythmic Cypher in Portland. This year I will be releasing my first album, a recorded version of my book with musical backing, recorded and mastered by Luk O'Connor of Portland.</p>
<p>For years, I've aspired to take my poetry to greater audiences, with a general goal of altering the way people view the world around them. Ever since I became aware of the existence of the Women of the World Poetry Slam (WOWPS), it became one of my greatest goals in life to attend as a competitor, not only to share my work, but to meet and learn from several of the greatest inspirations in my life and to my writing.</p>
<p>I am proud and honored to announce that I will be representing Port Veritas' Second Tuesday Slam, Portland, Maine, at the Women of the World Poetry Slam in Minneapolis, Minnesota this March 6-10. However, I am a full time college student... This is where you come in.</p>
<h3>$500, you say?</h3>
<p>WOWPS takes place in Minneapolis, close to 1500 miles from my home. Funding this journey as a student is a massive financial challenge, and any help would be greatly appreciated. I have my aforementioned chapbook, which I'd be happy to send to anyone who helps me get to this once-a-year internationally recognized event. There are also two other options of perks for your contributions listed to the right. </p>
<p>$500 will cover my plane ticket and my hotel room. Anything above and beyond will help with food, travel around Minneapolis, the printing of more chapbooks, and the inevitable sudden unexpected expenses during travel that no one foresees... but always happen.</p>
<p>Thank you all so very, very much. I'll see you at WOWPS!</p>

<p>I’m delighted to announce the upcoming launch of my first self-published cookbook, <strong>When Bakers Cook</strong>.</p>
<p><br/><strong>What's When Bakers Cook about?<br/></strong>In addition to great baking, I've also created some wonderful cooking recipes over the years via my food features for the New York Times, Washington Post, Bon Appetit, Food and Wine et al, and of course, for my popular website, <a href=""http://www.BetterBaking.com."" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.BetterBaking.com. <br/><br/></a>Now it's time to take the best of my best and wrap it up in a gorgeous<strong> print cookbook.</strong> Rather than offer a recipe here and there online, I want to share a total cooking experience with you – the one that comes with the joy of holding a one-of-kind cookbook in your hands. <strong>When Bakers Cook</strong> is destined to become an well-used, grease-stained beloved book, the foundation of many great meals for family and friends.<br/><br/></p>
<p><strong>What sort of recipes will you find in this cookbook?<br/><br/></strong>Over 175 of my best recipes! <strong>When Bakers Cook</strong> has only the best recipes from Breakfast (Red Velvet Waffles with Cream Cheese Drizzle, Drive-Thru Breakfast Sandwiches) and the world's most sensational Soups (Carrot Coriander, Bistro Squash Soup, and Pub Style Onion Soup au Gratin) to Chicken (Portugese Grilled Chicken, Morroccan Spice Chicken and Lemon Garlic Chicken), Beef (Guinness Beef Stew, Bistro Pepper Steak) and Sides, Salads, Desserts (Deluxe Banana Cream Pie, Diner Style Baked Apples). I’ve even included a bonus Baking chapter (Salted Caramel Cheesecake, Greek Yogurt  Blueberry Muffins and Carrot Cake Biscotti). Each recipe in this wonderful collection is simple, tasty, and at once trendy and classic.<br/><br/>It all makes for a very special cookbook that will become a new classic. This is a black and white cookbook, in the tradition of Silver Palate and Moosewood, cookbooks that are still revered and used by a few generations. I like to think of <strong>When Bakers Cook</strong> as a <em>Joy of Cooking</em> for the new millennium - it's everything you need and want in a cookbook but with a style and taste like no other cookbook. It's for new cooks and pros, filled not only with great recipes but the best of my tricks and trade secrets as a chef. <br/><br/></p>
<p><strong>Why Self-Publish?<br/></strong>Traditional publishing is changing and instead of focusing on great food and timeless recipes, celebrity and social media reign supreme. Alternatively, many cookbooks are also one-subject ones, showcasing the trends of the day. The celebrity cookbooks and TV shows also lack the warmth of a chef who has not only created her recipes for her readers, family and friends but is uniquely connected to her audience. To this end, there hasn't been such a comprehensive, one-voice, go-to cookbook on the market for the longest time; a cookbook that features contemporary classic and tasty recipes that are both easy to prepare and broadly appealing.<br/><br/></p>
<p><strong>What will the money be used for?<br/></strong>Cash is needed to pay the copy editors, proof-readers, indexers, photographers, graphic designers, and publishing formatters for both print and digital production. Funds are also needed to underwrite printing costs retail distribution fees. This cookbook also necessitates re-design and re-launching my website, <a href=""http://www.BetterBaking.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.BetterBaking.com</a> so that it is mechanically sound to support my cookbook efforts through e-commerce and promotion. <br/><br/><strong>When Bakers Cook</strong> is all but ready to roll: the recipes have triple-tested (thanks to a wonderful volunteer test team) and the manuscript is written. As it heads into production, its official book launch and will be for sale,  I’m calling upon my amazing community of subscribers to help me finance a publishing team and get this wonderful book out to the market. <br/><br/></p>

Where will the money go?The $3500.00 will go to production, publication, marketing, contest and prize giveaways. Right now we plan on a three month Light Local Authors on Fire Virtual Tour, with contests, marketing tips and giveaways for each locality. Should we exceed budget we will increase giveaways, and add some physical tour stops to complement our virtual tours. What will happen if we don’t meet budget?Should we fail to meet budget, we will still publish an Ebook, however we will not be able to publish a print version or do the virtual tours.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Blacktop Passages is a Literary Review focused on publishing the best stories, poetry and non-fiction centering on the road. When we say the road, we mean it and everything encompassing it. From travel to gas station. We embrace everything that connects to and connects us to the road.</p>
<p>We've started an Indie GoGo campaign as our work is completely voluntary and being an independent journal with intentions to print, this can difficult; we're not working within a university system, nor are we receiving government funding--so far everything accomplished from construction of the website, to the domain, to all things beauracratic (such as the road to requesting an ISSN) is money out of the four editors' pockets. Three of the editors are students in graduate MFA programs and one is a graduated author of a soon-to-be two novels, working hard at both Blacktop Passages and a Haitan magazine as well. We all work to the bone and spill money from our pocket to upkeep a goal we see as giving back. Giving back to the road which inspires all of us and  giving back to the writing community.</p>
<p>Our intention is to offer our journal completely FREE. If even when someone requests a copy over the Internet, we don't want to charge them for shipping. With your contribution you can help us keep that ideal.</p>
<p>Our distribution plan is really the most intensive and interesting: We want to watch Blacktop Passages spread across the roadways and interstates. We plan on distributing them at travel stops, rest areas and truck centers with a proposal that the recipient of the issue read it, enjoy it, pass it on and maybe even Tweet it.</p>
<p>Here it is broken down:</p>
<p>You're on a road trip and stop at a rest area somewhere outside of Chicago. There's a copy of Blacktop Passages sitting on a picnic table. You pick it up, get back in the car and read it on the road. Once you're finished with it and you've throughly enjoyed it, you can surely hang on to it if you want, or you can ""pass it on."" Just leave it at the next reast area, somewhere halfway to Arizona. Take a picture of it and Tweet it @ us. People can try and find a copy if one has crossed a local travel stop, or simply watch where one starts and where it ends up.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We've set our goal to $3000. This ensures we'll manage a large print run and be able to upkeep the basic operations of our organization and future issues. We know this seems like a high amount, but what it will do for us is more than you could realize. It keeps us thriving as a print journal, existing for at the very least several more years, with less worry of printing and distribution costs.</p>
<p>We dont have much to offer, but what we can offer we can offer lots of... which is our signatures, the print issue when it's released and other cool things like that. We hope you enjoy what we do offer. If you don't, let us know. We'll see if we can persuade you with other prizes... if we have other prizes.</p>
<p>If we don't reach our entire goal, that's okay. Any amount is helpful really. We're still going to do a print run--though it may be smaller--it will not go undone. We are a passionate group of writers &amp; editors and will accomplish what we set out to do come Hell or high water. But you can really help us. Even if it's just a few bucks.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Printed publications are becoming less and less these days. The literary publications that do still exist in printed form are becoming more and more expensive as time goes on, print costs go up and less people buy them.</p>
<p>We are doing exactly what those on the Books-A-Million shelf are doing... only for FREE. We believe good writing, should be honored and spread around. Given a proper presentation and bestowed upon the world. It shouldn't cost out your ear for it either.</p>
We also strive to advance and innovate the distribution, consumption and interactivity of literature. With Blacktop Passages, you're not only enjoying great writing, but you're also participating in a nationwide adventure--something along the lines of WheresGeorge.com or BookCrossing.com. We want great work to spread and it only seems fitting that it happens on a setting like the road, where many are in transition and constantly looking for things to keep their minds fresh.</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

Tell all your friends about us, especially the ones who are writers. Go to your local library or university and post our flyers around the buildings! Whatever you can do is a GREAT help to us!</p>

<div>Hi! We're Salima Alikhan and Steph Pellegrin, and we live in the kidlit haven of Austin, Texas, where we're surrounded by the creativity and support of our authorly community. We're both passionate and dedicated writers of children's fiction, and are very conscious of the need to tell truthful and diverse stories. We both write stories in which characters grapple with the kinds of things that accurately reflect children's lives: family dynamics, racial diversity, abuse, mental illness, finding one's place among obstacles big and small (and there are happy bits in our books, too -- we swears it on the Precious!) Sometimes these issues are dealt with via magic and sometimes via contemporary realism, but it's our belief that it's always important to write in a truthful and compassionate way.</div>
<div>We're always looking for opportunities to hone and deepen our craft. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">We've salivated over the idea of attending the Big Sur Writing Workshop for years, and this year, we decided to try to make it a reality. </span>
</div>
<div>We're hoping to make it to Big Sur next March, where we'd get to work closely with talented industry professionals. It would be an amazing opportunity to get a number of skillful eyes on our work and to get wonderful, in-depth feedback. </div>
<div>Your contribution would allow us to realize this dream.</div>

</div>
<div>The cost of the Big Sur Writing workshop is about $800 per person. We'll also need to buy airfare and get a rental car, which we're estimating at about $500 per person. We're asking for $2900 to cover workshop, travel, and tax expenses (any Indiegogo earnings are considered taxable income, so we'll be paying taxes on those, too, as well as paying Indiegogo their cut.) <br/>
</div> </div> <div> <h3>We Have Awesome Rewards for You!<br/>
</h3>
<div>Our fantabulous rewards include:</div>
<div>-postcards</div>
<div>-art prints by Salima</div>
<div>-three-dimensional book art by Stephanie</div>
<div>-Skype author visits</div>
<div>-critiques of up to 50 pages of your WIP </div>
<div>-getting a character named after you in one of our books</div>

Your contribution would allow us to realize this dream.

Where Your Contributions are Going

The cost of the Big Sur Writing workshop is about $800 per person. We'll also need to buy airfare and get a rental car, which we're estimating at about $500 per person. We're asking for $2900 to cover workshop, travel, and tax expenses (any Indiegogo earnings are considered taxable income, so we'll be paying taxes on those, too, as well as paying Indiegogo their cut.) 
   We Have Awesome Rewards for You!

Our fantabulous rewards include:
-postcards
-art prints by Salima
-three-dimensional book art by Stephanie
-Skype author visits
-critiques of up to 50 pages of your WIP 
-getting a character named after you in one of our books
Some Ways You Can Pitch In Even If You Can't Donate
Even if a monetary donation isn't in the cards for you right now, there are a number of ways you can help us! You can share our video on Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, any social media platform with which you're comfortable! Any shout-outs are much, much appreciated. Indiegogo makes sharing easy--you can use the Indiegogo share tools!

    Thank You So Much For Your Time and Contribution!!

<p>We are in a political moment where things are rapidly changing.  The Occupy movement has opened up new possibilities and made millions of people believe that another world is possible. There is a growing consciousness that we, as a society, need a new value system rooted in practices and structures of liberation. To create this new world, we will need to take on the corporations who are destroying our planet, devastating our communities, keeping us in debt, and profiting from it all. <strong>Kicking Corporate Booty will be a manual to help you do just that. </strong></p>
<p>Kicking Corporate Booty is a flexible model of strategic organizing that empowers ordinary people to take on corporations and win. I have been working with and evolving this model for over twenty years; winning victories with low-wage workers, anti-nuclear youth activists, DREAM activists, foreclosed homeowners, and others fighting for justice. </p>
<p>Now it’s time for me to take what I’ve learned and make these ideas widely accessible by publishing the Kicking Corporate Booty Manual. This Manual will lay out strategies, principles, and tools to permeate the collective consciousness with your issue, focus on clear targets, and build to a period of compression and crisis to win your campaign while building a culture of liberation.</p>
<p>The Manual will also have a companion website with downloadable resources, case studies, and a searchable database of key corporate players, a map-maker, and a forum to share resources and data.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<div>
<p></p>
<p>We hope to raise $1500
in order to learn how to better fund the literary outreach programs of the University
of North Carolina Wilmington MFA program. Some of these commitments include our
work with students of all ages and backgrounds through Writers in Action, Teens
Out Loud and the Summer Young Writers’ workshop. We seek to help our North
Carolina graduate students further engage with the whole of the literary
community through national conference involvement and by bolstering our reading
series. In this way, we aspire to better bridge the gap between our program, local
individuals in Wilmington, and the greater literary collective.</p>
<p>We hope, through this
funding, to make a difference for young writers, and also for Wilmington’s
artistry at large. With these funds we strive to foster passion for writing in
youth, especially as younger students read and write less for pleasure. With
your help, we believe we can assist in cultivating that passion. </p>

</div><div> <p></p>
<p><b>Our Goal</b></p>
<p>We’re looking to raise
a minimum of $1500 so that we can provide at least one $500 scholarship to an
at-need high-school student to attend the Young Writers’ Workshop, $1000 for
our students to attend the national Association of Writers and Writing Programs
conference (AWP), and any additional funding allocated to funding a second (or
third!) young writer if possible, and then AWP.  </p>
<p>We also hope to engage
more in our local and national writing community by growing our current reading
series and sending our graduate students to the national AWP conference. At AWP,
students are able to interact with the larger literary experience, connecting
our individual involvements with those of the world around us. At AWP, we are
able to broaden our literary experience, fostering connections between our
community and other writing professionals from all over the country. We believe that AWP is the place where the
newest ideas in writing and literature are explored, where writers from all
walks of life are able to come together to grapple with today’s most pressing
issues. </p>
<p></p>
<p>We hope to further
develop our current reading series as a platform for our students and the
public to come together around literature. We want to enlarge the scope of these
readings and explore how other programs have gotten their communities involved.</p>
<p>Further, we aim to research
effective techniques to develop our Teens Out Loud program in which graduate
students work with HIV-positive teens. Right now, the program is relatively
small and we’d like to better train our mentors to help give marginalized
individuals the opportunity to better express their experiences.  </p>
<p>Finally, we seek to
further develop our involvement with Writers in Action. We think that it is so important and rare for
students (and teachers) to get a break from test-based culture and instead
place greater focus on independent, creative thinking. With Writers in Action, graduate
students volunteer to teach creative writing weekly in local elementary,
junior, and high schools, fostering the love of reading and writing from a
young age.</p>
<b>Perks</b><p><b></b></p>
<p>Our perks are unique
to the UNCW creative writing department—if you’re an aspiring or established
writer, you have the opportunity to have your fiction, creative nonfiction, or
poetry receive personal feedback from a UNCW graduate student or one of UNCW’s
esteemed professors—Philip Gerard, Malena Morling, Mark Cox, or Clyde Edgerton.
</p>
<p>In addition to
limited-edition broadsides, literary bumper stickers and t-shirts, you can receive
editor-signed copies of the literary journals <i>Ecotone</i> and <i>Chautauqua</i>, as
well as signed copies of books from our faculty members—including rare and
first edition works.</p>
<p>If you’re really
looking to make a difference for a Young Writer, you have the opportunity for a
scholarship to be created in your name and receive a personalized note about
what the experience meant from the student you help to attend the Summer Young
Writers’ workshop—the first chance many of these students have to explore their
writing lives in a tangible way. </p>
<p><b>Allotment</b></p>
<p>If we don’t reach our entire goal, we will first fund one
student to attend the Young Writers’ Workshop. The remaining funds will go to
AWP unless we can (hopefully!) fund additional scholarships for the workshops.
Any donation under the tier of funding a student will go directly to a student!
We promise to fund one student even if no scholarship tiers are donated (which
means that our first $500 goes directly to a young writer).</p>
<br/><ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>Our Indiegogo campaign
two years ago exceeded our own expectation. With the generous donations, we
were able to facilitate the attendance of a few Young Writers who were unable
to attend on their own. We were also fortunate enough to partially fund a group
of representative students to AWP, where the students not only modeled our
ideals as writers, but further engaged similar literary communities who shared
with us their own outreach methodologies. This opportunity also gave our
students a platform to further their careers, by meeting with fellow writers,
editors, and agents, all of whom came together under the devotion to
literature.</p>
<p><span>Though this experience, we have been able to broaden our
outreach over these past two years, and we hope to accomplish even more. By
helping fund our campaign, we believe that we will be able to help perpetuate

Short Summary


We hope to raise $1500
in order to learn how to better fund the literary outreach programs of the University
of North Carolina Wilmington MFA program. Some of these commitments include our
work with students of all ages and backgrounds through Writers in Action, Teens
Out Loud and the Summer Young Writers’ workshop. We seek to help our North
Carolina graduate students further engage with the whole of the literary
community through national conference involvement and by bolstering our reading
series. In this way, we aspire to better bridge the gap between our program, local
individuals in Wilmington, and the greater literary collective.
We hope, through this
funding, to make a difference for young writers, and also for Wilmington’s
artistry at large. With these funds we strive to foster passion for writing in
youth, especially as younger students read and write less for pleasure. With
your help, we believe we can assist in cultivating that passion. 


What We Need & What You Get
 
Our Goal
We’re looking to raise
a minimum of $1500 so that we can provide at least one $500 scholarship to an
at-need high-school student to attend the Young Writers’ Workshop, $1000 for
our students to attend the national Association of Writers and Writing Programs
conference (AWP), and any additional funding allocated to funding a second (or
third!) young writer if possible, and then AWP.  
We also hope to engage
more in our local and national writing community by growing our current reading
series and sending our graduate students to the national AWP conference. At AWP,
students are able to interact with the larger literary experience, connecting
our individual involvements with those of the world around us. At AWP, we are
able to broaden our literary experience, fostering connections between our
community and other writing professionals from all over the country. We believe that AWP is the place where the
newest ideas in writing and literature are explored, where writers from all
walks of life are able to come together to grapple with today’s most pressing
issues. 

We hope to further
develop our current reading series as a platform for our students and the
public to come together around literature. We want to enlarge the scope of these
readings and explore how other programs have gotten their communities involved.
Further, we aim to research
effective techniques to develop our Teens Out Loud program in which graduate
students work with HIV-positive teens. Right now, the program is relatively
small and we’d like to better train our mentors to help give marginalized
individuals the opportunity to better express their experiences.  
Finally, we seek to
further develop our involvement with Writers in Action. We think that it is so important and rare for
students (and teachers) to get a break from test-based culture and instead
place greater focus on independent, creative thinking. With Writers in Action, graduate
students volunteer to teach creative writing weekly in local elementary,
junior, and high schools, fostering the love of reading and writing from a
young age.
Perks
Our perks are unique
to the UNCW creative writing department—if you’re an aspiring or established
writer, you have the opportunity to have your fiction, creative nonfiction, or
poetry receive personal feedback from a UNCW graduate student or one of UNCW’s
esteemed professors—Philip Gerard, Malena Morling, Mark Cox, or Clyde Edgerton.

In addition to
limited-edition broadsides, literary bumper stickers and t-shirts, you can receive
editor-signed copies of the literary journals Ecotone and Chautauqua, as
well as signed copies of books from our faculty members—including rare and
first edition works.
If you’re really
looking to make a difference for a Young Writer, you have the opportunity for a
scholarship to be created in your name and receive a personalized note about
what the experience meant from the student you help to attend the Summer Young
Writers’ workshop—the first chance many of these students have to explore their
writing lives in a tangible way. 
Allotment
If we don’t reach our entire goal, we will first fund one
student to attend the Young Writers’ Workshop. The remaining funds will go to
AWP unless we can (hopefully!) fund additional scholarships for the workshops.
Any donation under the tier of funding a student will go directly to a student!
We promise to fund one student even if no scholarship tiers are donated (which
means that our first $500 goes directly to a young writer).
    The Impact 
Our Indiegogo campaign
two years ago exceeded our own expectation. With the generous donations, we
were able to facilitate the attendance of a few Young Writers who were unable
to attend on their own. We were also fortunate enough to partially fund a group
of representative students to AWP, where the students not only modeled our
ideals as writers, but further engaged similar literary communities who shared
with us their own outreach methodologies. This opportunity also gave our
students a platform to further their careers, by meeting with fellow writers,
editors, and agents, all of whom came together under the devotion to
literature.
Though this experience, we have been able to broaden our
outreach over these past two years, and we hope to accomplish even more. By
helping fund our campaign, we believe that we will be able to help perpetuate
the love of reading and writing in our communities. 


Risks & Challenges  
At this point in our
experience, we have a strong foundation with our past work, and we don’t want
to risk the loss of what we've already built. Without your help, our biggest uncertainty
is our inability to help a young writer pursue his or her passion for writing.   Other Ways You Can Help 
If
you’d like to contribute, but you just don’t have the funds to help out, we’d
appreciate anything you can do to Share the Word—whether on Facebook, Twitter,
your own blog, or through an email to a literature-loving friend. Every contribution,
even the smallest, will help us work toward our goal of outreach in our North

<h3><strong>The Book</strong></h3>
<p>Today there are an endless variety of teachings, techniques, and practices promising spiritual awakening to help us live happier, more fulfilled lives. While this is great, it can also be confusing. On what basis do we know how to choose what serves us? Without a unifying center, how does it all hang together? We want to walk our own path, but we also want to make sure we are going somewhere worthwhile. Our awakening is just the start of a road that no one before us has traveled.</p>
<p>The Tapestry of Being is far more than a collection of exercises, techniques, and practices. It is a way to hold the mutually contradictory spiritual teachings of the world in a universal holistic context. This vision is for someone who wants to trust the authority within themselves while still fruitfully, and respectfully, approaching past traditions and systems. It's about relating to teachings and teachers that you meet in such a way that honors what they offer without limiting you.</p>
<p>THE TAPESTRY OF BEING is the first book of a planned series of four, subtitled <i>Talks on Practical Mysticism. </i>These teachings convey a way of relating to the mystery of existence that is broad-minded, paradoxical, and intensely in­dividual. For those who may be looking for a non-sectarian template that you can use on your own or with oth­ers, this is an inclusive non-dual orientation that shows you ways to contact your inner guidance and develop in six essential dimensions.</p>
<p>This started as tele-course in 2013. After years of developing the teachings, and testing the materials with students, adding and rewriting, I finished the first draft in 2017 and continued with editing throughout 2018.</p>
<p>I'm excited to begin to share this perspective with the larger world and consider this book the start of something that will bridge both individuals and cultures on this ever-smaller planet.</p>
<p><strong>If you'd like to directly donate please click the fuchsia ""Back It""</strong><u> <strong>button</strong></u> to the right of the above video.</p>
<p>And there are plenty of thank you gifts (""perks"") to choose from.</p>
<h3><strong>The Budget</strong></h3>
<p>The budget for this Indigogo goes toward transcriptions, publication, distribution and promotion costs for this book.  It will also go toward the building of a quality website (<a href=""http://www.Tapestryofbeing.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.Tapestryofbeing.org/) </a>for this and the future books advancing the Tapestry of Being vision of devotion, embodiment, and relationship.</p>
<p>The plan is that the book will be ready to ship just after the campaign has ended on June 19.  The books and all perks will be sent out then.<br/>When you self-publish, you are not just the author; you are the publicist, the advertiser, and the promoter. This is a big undertaking, and I welcome all the support I can get. So many friends through the years have helped me in uncovering this understanding, and I hope you'll come along on this journey with me!</p>

<p>My name is Krishna Gauci; I was brought up in the projects of the Bronx, and the suburbs of New Jersey. I’ve worked as a cab driver, an auto assembly line worker, a cabinetmaker, and a city bus driver. In 1992, after more than a decade of meditating and working with various spiritual teachers, I came across the teacher HWL Poonja, who was one of the last living disciples of the great Indian sage Sri Ramana Maharshi. My times spent with Poonjaji were the most potent and clarifying encounters I ever had. He was at once an intensely devout man in the Hindu Bhakti Devotional tradition as well as being a staunch proponent of non-dual Advaita Teachings. My experience of myself and the nature of reality was changed forever in the presence of Poonja. With him, there was an awakening recognition of Consciousness as being what I always already am.</p>
<p>After Poonja’s passing, I found myself attracted to a community of spiritual teachers who were actively bringing non-dual teachings into a more relational, embodied, emotional and practical sphere. In association with what later became the Trillium Awakening community, I found myself developing in ways that I did not expect: with my identity as an all-pervading energetic presence awakened into life itself. I then became a teacher and spiritual counselor as part of an alliance of like-minded teachers, assisting people in awakened living. I’ve worked with hundreds of people in both retreat settings and individual consulting sessions. My approach is down to earth and practical, even as it points to the highest transcendence.</p>
<h3><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h3>
<p>As with any crowdfunding, there can always be unforeseen difficulties with timeline, shipping, and other things. However, because ""The Tapestry of Being"" as a book is entirely written, has gone through many edits, and has gone through many readings, I don't foresee any significant changes to it and feel confident in my timeline for its release. I also believe I've given myself enough time to order, and ship all the perks in a timely manner so I find any issues with that to be near non-existent.<br/>Of course, I know there is always a chance the project won't be fully funded. If that is the case, the project will not be abandoned, and will continue on.<br/>I deeply believe in this vision and I think it would be great for other people to be excited about it too. I fully intend to move forward with it and supporters will still receive their rewards no matter what!<br/> </p>

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p><i>Chronic: Daring to go Beyond</i> is a collection of stories of women with chronic illnesses and/or disabilities who have succeeded regardless of the stigma. In the book, we take a closer look at the secrets that made us succeed and how you can apply them in your own life.<br/><br/>My name is Nicole M. Pagán-Aponte, and I am the author of Chronic: Daring to go Beyond. I wrote this book because I wanted to show you all the things we learned in our rocky journey and how daring to adapt made us succeed. Whether you have been recently diagnosed with an illness, living with one all your life, or are just beginning your path toward your goal, you can apply these teachings and reach success.<br/><br/>Anyone can use the tools that we developed. The truth is, illness is just a very concrete representation of the challenges we all may face on the way to our dreams.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that success may not be a linear road, but your dreams are attainable. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for ending the stigma around chronic illness, mental illness, and disability. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you reach success through the principles of mental adaptation.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about resilience and empowerment through vulnerability. You'll hear stories such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Embracing creativity</li>
<li>Taking your power</li>
<li>Owning your story</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you believe in the importance of diversity and inclusion, enjoy making a deep connection with others, and love a good underdog story.<br/><br/>Chronic: Daring to go Beyond speaks to young professionals and chronically ill or disabled individuals who want to look at success and vulnerability in a new way.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Book - <i>Chronic: Daring to go beyond</i>
</h3>
<p>The book is written in 3 parts.<br/><br/><strong>Part 1</strong> contains the introduction + chapter 2-3. We will begin explaining how we got here. When we started this journey we all faced a similar issue, people around us believed we should settle. Maybe you've faced this as well. The pain and shame of people not believing in you. Learn the story of how me and Carolyn Casey, founder of Valuable 500, were startled by our diagnosis and how we were faced with a choice that would change our whole outlook on life.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong> contains chapters 4-9. Here we will dive into the <i>principles of mental adaptation</i>. These are the concrete secrets to success that you can apply in your life to foster your own resilience. Learn how innovators Elizabeth Tikoyan, founder of Riley, Hannah Olson<span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">, founder of Chronically Capable, and Tiffany Yu, founder of Diversability, created their empires that are making a difference today.</span></p>
<p><br/><strong>Part 3</strong> contains chapters 10-11. These are the closing chapters were we will reflect on where we stand today. Alongside Dr. Katherine Breward, an associate professor at the University of Winnipeg, who specializes in human resource management with a particular focus on diversity programming and combating non-conscious prejudice, we will discuss the things we can do to make sure <strong>everyone </strong>has a chance of succeeding through fostering inclusion and unlearning unconscious bias.</p>

<h3>About the Author</h3>
<p>Nicole M. Pagán-Aponte is a recovering people pleaser. Back in 2013 during her freshman year of Chemical Engineering, she was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), depression, and IBS. Following her diagnosis many people told her she wouldn’t make it as an engineer. Fast forward to today, she is a Harvard Business School SVMP Alumni and Forbes Under 30 Scholar. In 2020, she graduated with honors from the University of PR in Mayagüez with a bachelor's in chemical engineering and a minor in pharmaceutical engineering. Following that, she got her dream job as an engineer at a Fortune 500 company and co-founded a non-profit called LeadUp, a mentoring network helping young professionals in Puerto Rico with their career paths.<br/><br/>Her mission: to make people around her to reach their highest potential. She believes that for that we must <strong>#EndtheStigma</strong> around mental health. Once she embraced her illness, she began to meet amazing women with incredibly powerful stories. She hopes to share their stories both to help young women like her who are coming to terms with their diagnosis and to highlight how your dreams don't end with your illness.<br/><br/>Nicole is an animal lover. On her tiny farm, she houses a bunny, 2 sheep, 3 cats, 3 dogs, and 14 ducks. (And counting…)<br/><br/>She loves to help so feel free to reach her if you are interested in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understanding the experience of dealing with mental illness</li>
<li>If you want someone to talk to about your mental health</li>
<li>Tips and tricks to work with your own anxiety</li>
<li>If you need free career mentoring and advice</li>

<h3>Preorders</h3>
<p>For international preorders, please send me a private message.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by including the cost of mailing and shipping the signed copies into each pre-order tier.<br/><br/>The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we ship the pre-order rewards to you as early as possible. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as to when my book will publish. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.</p>

Chronic: Daring to go Beyond is a collection of stories of women with chronic illnesses and/or disabilities who have succeeded regardless of the stigma. In the book, we take a closer look at the secrets that made us succeed and how you can apply them in your own life.My name is Nicole M. Pagán-Aponte, and I am the author of Chronic: Daring to go Beyond. I wrote this book because I wanted to show you all the things we learned in our rocky journey and how daring to adapt made us succeed. Whether you have been recently diagnosed with an illness, living with one all your life, or are just beginning your path toward your goal, you can apply these teachings and reach success.Anyone can use the tools that we developed. The truth is, illness is just a very concrete representation of the challenges we all may face on the way to our dreams.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that success may not be a linear road, but your dreams are attainable. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for ending the stigma around chronic illness, mental illness, and disability. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you reach success through the principles of mental adaptation.In this book, you'll learn about resilience and empowerment through vulnerability. You'll hear stories such as:

Embracing creativity
Taking your power
Owning your story

You will love this book if you believe in the importance of diversity and inclusion, enjoy making a deep connection with others, and love a good underdog story.Chronic: Daring to go Beyond speaks to young professionals and chronically ill or disabled individuals who want to look at success and vulnerability in a new way.

The Book - Chronic: Daring to go beyond

The book is written in 3 parts.Part 1 contains the introduction + chapter 2-3. We will begin explaining how we got here. When we started this journey we all faced a similar issue, people around us believed we should settle. Maybe you've faced this as well. The pain and shame of people not believing in you. Learn the story of how me and Carolyn Casey, founder of Valuable 500, were startled by our diagnosis and how we were faced with a choice that would change our whole outlook on life.Part 2 contains chapters 4-9. Here we will dive into the principles of mental adaptation. These are the concrete secrets to success that you can apply in your life to foster your own resilience. Learn how innovators Elizabeth Tikoyan, founder of Riley, Hannah Olson, founder of Chronically Capable, and Tiffany Yu, founder of Diversability, created their empires that are making a difference today.
Part 3 contains chapters 10-11. These are the closing chapters were we will reflect on where we stand today. Alongside Dr. Katherine Breward, an associate professor at the University of Winnipeg, who specializes in human resource management with a particular focus on diversity programming and combating non-conscious prejudice, we will discuss the things we can do to make sure everyone has a chance of succeeding through fostering inclusion and unlearning unconscious bias.

What I Need & What You'll Get
This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:

The editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in August, 2021.

The layout design for the interior of my book (physical copy, ebook formats).
The copy editing for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.
The launch & promotion efforts for my book when I ultimately publish this summer.

When I pre-sell 120 copies of my book, I will publish a paperback and ebook. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish a translated edition. I have partnered with Diversability to use some of the money raised to continue furthering their mission, amplifying Disability voices. 
I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:

About the Author

In 2020, she graduated with honors from the University of PR in Mayagüez with a bachelor's in chemical engineering and a minor in pharmaceutical engineering.

She believes that for that we must #EndtheStigma around mental health. Once she embraced her illness, she began to meet amazing women with incredibly powerful stories. She hopes to share their stories both to help young women like her who are coming to terms with their diagnosis and to highlight how your dreams don't end with your illness.Nicole is an animal lover. On her tiny farm, she houses a bunny, 2 sheep, 3 cats, 3 dogs, and 14 ducks. (And counting…)She loves to help so feel free to reach her if you are interested in:

Risks & Challenges
The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by including the cost of mailing and shipping the signed copies into each pre-order tier.The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we ship the pre-order rewards to you as early as possible. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as to when my book will publish. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.

<h3><u>The Inspiration for <i>Wonder Walk</i></u></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>My name is ILHAM (name is derived from Arabic, meaning <i>Inspiration or Imagination </i>). And true to the <i>Inspiration </i>of my name, I wrote this rhyming picture book back in 2015, during one sunny afternoon, while my oldest child was napping after our own long 'wonder walk'. This was in our home city of Toronto, when we used to live in the Leaside area- a historic neighborhood known for being a ""verdant"" place with friendly neighbours. At that time, my son was still under a year old, so I used my imagination to see how a little boy would talk with his beloved parent. </p>
<p>I have to say, my now- 4 year old talks a lot like Johnny does in <i>Wonder Walk. </i>I try to satisfy his endless curiosity to the best of my abilities, but I get stumped, just like Mommy does in this book. Anyone who has kids or is around them, will know what I am talking about :) </p>
<p>Apart from children's book writing, I also blog about kids books me and my kids love &amp; our travel experiences over at <a href=""https://www.storymummy.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">StoryMummy</a></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Inez Stanton wants nothing more than to live her quiet life ferrying cargo around the galaxy. However, the space debris that just hit her rig has other plans. As she fights to keep the ship running long enough to get help, her past seems to be along for the ride. Between the totalitarian regime controlling this part of the galaxy, mysterious shipwrecks, and living cargo, the stakes are way higher than Inez is looking for.</p>
<p>I'm JS Carter Gilson, and I've written this novella (and am writing more) featuring Inez. She's one of my favorite characters that I've created, and I want to give her the best chance to shine.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>What I need is just a few hundred dollars to get across the finish line. This is going to go toward editing and cover design, and depending on how much I earn, interior design as well.</p>
<p>At different levels, you'll get the novella (in ebook, in print, or both), a well as the ebook of my novel Fiends of the Hub. If you give enough, I'll even deface your book with a Sharpie with something resembling my signature!</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I have a firm idea of how much I want to pay for services, but truth be told, I know full well that we'll probably run into other issues that will increase the cost. I am asking a hair over my estimate to cover the cost of sending physical books.</p>

</div></div>","¿Qué?
Mafia. Venganza en Chicago es una novela de género, en la delgada línea que separa al noir más puro del hard boiled, en la que dos grandes Mafias chocan de frente y como si de locomotoras se tratase todo a su alrededor se estremece...
A un inspector de homicidios de la ciudad de Chicago, alcohólico y mujeriego, se le asigna como compañera una recién licenciada, primera de su promoción, impuesta por los altos cargos de la Policía de Chicago, hartos de los incidentes que provoca en sus casos.
Mientras tanto, se conoce el asesinato de un miembro de la mafia irlandesa de Staten Island, la cual se haya en medio de una guerra en Nueva York. Este asesinato acaba por ser relacionado con el misterioso Scarface, Capo di tutti de la Mafia de Chicago, con lo que la batalla amenaza con sacudir la Ciudad del Viento.

Una Mexicana que Fruta Vendía narra la historia de Sofía, una chica de la Ciudad de México que viaja a Alemania para estudiar en una prestigiosa universidad de Colonia. Encontrará en su camino a Inés y juntas vivirán una historia repleta de magia, amor y belleza, con un carácter narrativo único en su tipo, que invitará al lector a recrear con la imaginación la delicadeza sutil que nos envuelve día a día y que hemos perdido la costumbre de observar y sentir. Representa entonces los anhelos del escritor, por un mundo utópico pero plausible, donde el autor plasma la esencia encantadora que nos define como seres sensibles, capaces de esparcir el amor adonde quiera que vayamos.

Tu colaboración puede ayudarnos. Cada cantidad de dinero, grande o pequeña, es un impulso para volver realidad esta historia y fomentar un estímulo diferente en la manera en la que vivimos nuestras vidas como seres humanos.     Lo que necesitamos y lo que obtienes Publicar una novela es un trabajo tremendamente dificultoso, mucho más si no se cuentan con los recursos económicos o las relaciones sociales necesarias.

   El impacto que deseamos generar En una sociedad que transcurre a través de la postmodernidad, la ideología y los valores del amor, el respeto y la pasión han trascendido sus definiciones.

<p><b>Dakle!</b> <br/><br/>Riječ je o kraljevstvu Lo, u današnjem Nepalu, u
pokrajini Mustang.</p>
<p>Dakle plan
je otići u Mustang, popeti se – malo džipom, malo pješke, a malo klatareći se na magarcu – do grada Lo
Manthang, prepričati najzanimljivija opažanja i ispucati hrpu fotografija. </p>
<p>Primijetit
ćete da su dijelovi teksta koji nisu specifično vezani za Mustang slični kao i
za lanjsku, vrlo uspješnu kampanju za Pamirski trakt, jer osnovna ideja je ista
– otići negdje, u neku rupu svijeta za koju je malo tko čuo, i složiti putopis
bogat jakim fotografijama (to zovem ""fotopis"").</p>
<p><b>Kakva je priča s tim ""izgubljenim
kraljevstvom"" Lo?</b></p>
<p>Kao prvo, Izgubljeno
kraljevstvo ili Lost Kingdom jednostavno sjajno zvuči, podsjeća na Indianu
Jonesa, Svena Hedina, Warrena Langdona, braću Seljan, na neku poštenu i
pamtljivu avanturu. Osim toga je i – istinito. Nepal je bio kraljevstvo
stoljećima (više nije, ali o tome malo kasnije). </p>
<p>Jedna od
provincija Nepala zove se Mustang – nema veze s američkim divljim konjima niti
Ford Mustangom. Mustang je samo jedna, zapadnjacima najlakša, traskripcija
imena provincije. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460767025/Image2_y65gie.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Mustang je
po svemu različit od ostatka Nepala. Za početak, nalazi se u sjeni Himalaja pa
ga ne zahvaća monsun. Za razliku od ostatka Nepala, Mustang je suh, nije zelen
a niti pokriven snijegom. Kao drugo, Mustang je etnički i kulturološki bliži
Tibetu, s kojim graniči na sjeveru, nego Nepalu. Neki putnici koji su bili na
""pravom"" Tibetu, kažu da su tibetansku kulturu najsnažnije osjetili
baš u Mustangu.</p>
<p>I treće, Mustang je do pred svega nekoliko godina bio
polu-nezavisno kraljevstvo Lo. I sam Nepal je bio kraljevstvo. Lo-Mustang imao
je vlastitog kralja, koji je bio potčinjen nepalskom. Ovo nije neobično u
kraljevskim odnosima. Kako je Nepal hendlao sve, pa i vanjsku politiku,
minijaturno, izolirano, među planine zametnuto kraljevstvo Lo nije bilo nikakav
međunarodni faktor.</p>
<p>A onda se
desilo – što?</p>
<p>2008 u
Nepalu je ukinuta kraljevina, i država je postala republika. Ovo je za Nepal
bio big deal. Duga priča,
da ne idemo previše u detalje – bit će vremena kasnije u priči kad krene
putopis – kraljevstvo je u Nepalu abolirano 2008, a nestankom kraljevstva u
samom Nepalu, nestalo je i ono u Lo-Mustangu. Otud naziv kampanje – Izgubljeno
kraljevstvo, Lost Kingdom.</p>
<p>I zaista je
Lost Kingdom!</p>
<p>Nakon leta
za Katmandu, truckanja do Pokare i bauljanja do Jomsoma, iz tog grada kreće
završni dio ekspedicije prema naselju Lo Manthang, glavnom gradu Loa, na visini
od oko 4.000 metara – visina slična Pamiru lani. Da pravo kažem, nisam lud ni
za hodanjem a još manje za planinarenjem. Zanimaju me <b>PRIČE</b> i <b>FOTOGRAFIJE</b>.
Stoga je meni osobno najdraži način putovanja unajmljeni Land Cruiser, Pajero
ili UAZ, ali ovaj put to neće biti posve moguće. </p>
<p>Lo-Mustang
jednostavno nema cesta. Iako će se dio puta nadam se, pokriti terencem ili čak
ponijem (mali tibetanski konji, poniji), neke dijelove morat ćemo pješačiti. </p>
<p>Tko smo to
mi? Kao i lani na uspješnu ekspediciju na Pamir, planiram ići s Francoisom, frendom iz
Francuske. Ako Francois bude morao odustati – idem sam ili u nekoj drugoj
kombinaciji. Francois je inače super lik, lani je bio odličan partner, svakako
bi volio ići s njim, stvari bi bile nekoliko puta lakše (uglavnom psihološki). Ovo smo ja i Francois u Kirgistanu, s tradicionalnim kirgiskim kapama.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460766868/11863165_10153444093449543_1813690232_o_z4w4br.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

:o)</h3>
<p><b>Kad se ide?</b></p>
<p>Plan je kolovoz 2016. Nitko normalan, inače, ne ide u
Nepal u kolovozu, jer je tad sezona monsuna u snazi, kišno je, vlažno i
bezveze. Za posjete Nepalu kolovoz je kao nama siječanj – dno sezone. Međutim,
kako sam napomenuo, ovo ne važi za Mustang, ili barem ne u tolikoj mjeri, jer
je ova neobična provincija u sjeni Himalaja i ne zahvaća je monsun.</p>
<p><b>Zašto biste
trebali podržati ovu kampanju?</b></p>
<p>Zato što ti
osobno koji ovo čitaš nećeš nikad u životu otići tamo. Ne zanima te, ne da ti se, daleko je.... IPAK, imaš priliku sudjelovati u odlasku u Izgubljeno
kraljevstvo – preko ove kampanje! Neka atom tebe ipak ide tamo, atom zvan
dolar, kuna, dojčmarka. Gledat ćeš fotke, postove odande i pomisiliti ""i
djelić mene je sad tamo u toj pripizdini"". </p>
<p>Ako spadaš u
1% onih koji planiraju ići, ali negdje u budućnosti, onda se opet isplati
sudjelovati u kampanji jer čitat ćeš putopisne opaske pa ćeš na temelju njih
bolje isplanirati svoj vlastiti put i imat ćeš kvalitetnu fotku da te podsjeća
na nešto gdje si i sam bio, tj bit ćeš jednom kada i ako odeš tamo. </p>
<p></p>

</b><p></p>
<p><b>Što se
dobije zauzvrat, šta ima od perkova?</b></p>
<p>Ovo je
jednostavna kampanja i nema puno perkova.</p>
<p><strong>16 doloresa -
Fotopis</strong></p>
<p>Za 16 dolara (popust u odnosu na Pamir lani) dobiješ 
putopis, sve postove i fotke koje ću stavljati kao pripremu i sa samog
putovanja. Računam dosta pisati i u pripremnoj fazi, tema je zaista zanimljiva
i ima materijala. Naravno, i sa samog lica mjesta ću stavljati fotke, putopisne
crtice i slično. Lani s Pamira bilo je ukupno preko 200 fotki i 110.000 znakova
teksta – dakle teksta za omanji roman! </p>
<p>Ovo s putopisom mislim
riješiti vrlo jednostavno. Tko uplati 16 dolara, jednostavno ću ga dodati u posebnu zatvorenu grupu na Facebooku za ovaj projekt, i postove za one koji su pomogli kampanju
učiniti vidljivima grupi ""pomagača"" da ih oni gledaju i da im
osvježe dan, a drugi ne vide. Putopis i fotke neće biti Public! </p>
<p>Nije neka sigurnost s pet
ključeva PGP-a, OIB-om i identifikacijom mrežnice, nego jednostavno, fleksibilno
i za korisnika potpuno bezbolno. Kad uplatiš 16 dolara za putopis na Fejsu,
više NE TREBAŠ URADITI NIŠTA, samo budi na Fejsu, imam tvoje ime i ideš na
distro listu za odgovarajuće Fejs postove vezane s putopisom i to je to. Ne može
lakše.</p>
<p>Sjedit ćeš sredinom kolovoza
na Jadranu i dignuti Fejs ""ajd baš da vidim šta ima"" a tamo – postovi
s Himalaje, neka budala gladan i smrznut u nekim vrletima. LOL! I još mora
fotkati jer je obećao u kampanji. Nasmiješ se idiotu i nastaviš pržiti na
suncu, pijuć koktel i gledajuć komade.</p>
<p>Ovaj model isti je kao za
lanjsku ekspediciju na Pamir i funkcionirao je odlično. Cijena perka je niža
nego lani!</p>
<p><strong>50 doloresa –
Fotopis F+</strong></p>
<p>Isto kao fotopis,
samo za one koji mogu i žele pomoći malo više! Prošli put sam u ovom
rangu nudio Fotopis + pivo, ali onda se desilo sljedeće – nakon povratka kad
sam ponudio ljudima da se nađemo i ""odradimo"" dogovoreno pivo koje im
pripada, svi su u nekoj gužvi, ovo, ono, a ja sam zapravo sve s terena
ispričao, i fotke stavio, već u putopisu. Tako da je to s pivom ispalo malo
promašeno. </p>
<p>U svakom slučaju –
budući da je 16 dolara zbilja sitna lova, tko želi pomoći s 50 – samo naprijed,
<b>cijenim to</b>, ekspedicija ima velike troškove.... a što se piva tiče, lako
se dogovorimo.</p>
<p><strong>199 doloresa – Big
Picture</strong></p>
<p>Lovatori i oni koji vole
umjetnost – ne znam kako će se pogledati u ogledalo ako ne uzmu ovaj jaki perk
od 199 dolara... uspješni startupi, njihovi pokretači, investitori, vlasnici
iPhonea, kapitalisti, neoliberali, paleoanarhisti, ljubitelji Tesli, mrzitelji
Tesli, poduzetnici, saborski zastupnici, socijalisti, kriminalci.... a svih njih ima među

<p><strong>Što
s lovom ako ne odem?</strong></p>
<p>Imam namjeru otići u Mustang
kad-tad, dakle jedini realni problem koji se može dogoditi jest odgoda puta
zbog nečega, nemam pojma čega. Ako se baš desi da iz bilo kojeg razloga –
geopolitičkog, zdravstvenog... nikako ne mogu u Mustang... onda mogu obećati da
ću sredstva po vrlo sličnom planu iskoristiti za neki sličan projekt, možda čak
i zanimljiviji. Myanmar (Burma), Bolivija, Jakutija, Osetija, Transnistria, neka izgubljena, ali zanimljiva rupetina u svakom slučaju...</p>
<p>Isto vrijedi i ako se ne
ispuni financijski cilj. Ekspedicija u Mustang vrlo je skupa. Ako se ne
skupi ciljani iznos – putopis će biti s neke druge, skromnije lokacije. U
svakom slučaju – bit će zanimljivo....</p>
<p><strong>English
summary</strong></p>
<p>Hi, this is a campaign to
get funding for expedition to Mustang province in Nepal, the seat of the former
Kingdom of Lo. This Kingdom is no more, it was abolished along with Kingdom of
Nepal itself, back in 2008. </p>
<p>The project is in Croatian,
because I plan to go there and write travelogue in Croatian language, for my
Croat readers (and others who understand Croatian). I will also post high
quality photos – in fact, photos are the main motivation to go there. So, since
photos do not require any translation – if you like nice photos you can support
the campaign too... thanks.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460766933/IMG_9212_baw6ph.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460766966/IMG_9028_q47f94.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Rijeka Pjanž - granica s Afganistanom</p>

presentsThe Lost
Kingdom/Izgubljeno kraljevstvo
There is a
summary in English at the very bottom of this page. Hvala Hrvoje Hafner ""haf-o-matic"" na trudu oko videa, hvala Yeti Expedition na ustupanju video zapisa iz pokrajine Mustang. Hvala Duško Korlat na glazbi... Dolaskom glavnog sponzora – mrežne trgovine enaA.com – službeno ime kampanje je: enaA.com - Izgubljeno kraljevstvo!
Dakle! Riječ je o kraljevstvu Lo, u današnjem Nepalu, u
pokrajini Mustang.
Dakle plan
je otići u Mustang, popeti se – malo džipom, malo pješke, a malo klatareći se na magarcu – do grada Lo
Manthang, prepričati najzanimljivija opažanja i ispucati hrpu fotografija. 
Primijetit
ćete da su dijelovi teksta koji nisu specifično vezani za Mustang slični kao i
za lanjsku, vrlo uspješnu kampanju za Pamirski trakt, jer osnovna ideja je ista
– otići negdje, u neku rupu svijeta za koju je malo tko čuo, i složiti putopis
bogat jakim fotografijama (to zovem ""fotopis"").
Kakva je priča s tim ""izgubljenim
kraljevstvom"" Lo?
Kao prvo, Izgubljeno
kraljevstvo ili Lost Kingdom jednostavno sjajno zvuči, podsjeća na Indianu
Jonesa, Svena Hedina, Warrena Langdona, braću Seljan, na neku poštenu i
pamtljivu avanturu. Osim toga je i – istinito. Nepal je bio kraljevstvo
stoljećima (više nije, ali o tome malo kasnije). 
Jedna od
provincija Nepala zove se Mustang – nema veze s američkim divljim konjima niti
Ford Mustangom. Mustang je samo jedna, zapadnjacima najlakša, traskripcija
imena provincije. 
Mustang je
po svemu različit od ostatka Nepala. Za početak, nalazi se u sjeni Himalaja pa
ga ne zahvaća monsun. Za razliku od ostatka Nepala, Mustang je suh, nije zelen
a niti pokriven snijegom. Kao drugo, Mustang je etnički i kulturološki bliži
Tibetu, s kojim graniči na sjeveru, nego Nepalu. Neki putnici koji su bili na
""pravom"" Tibetu, kažu da su tibetansku kulturu najsnažnije osjetili
baš u Mustangu.
I treće, Mustang je do pred svega nekoliko godina bio
polu-nezavisno kraljevstvo Lo. I sam Nepal je bio kraljevstvo. Lo-Mustang imao
je vlastitog kralja, koji je bio potčinjen nepalskom. Ovo nije neobično u
kraljevskim odnosima. Kako je Nepal hendlao sve, pa i vanjsku politiku,
minijaturno, izolirano, među planine zametnuto kraljevstvo Lo nije bilo nikakav
međunarodni faktor.
A onda se
desilo – što?
2008 u
Nepalu je ukinuta kraljevina, i država je postala republika. Ovo je za Nepal
bio big deal. Duga priča,
da ne idemo previše u detalje – bit će vremena kasnije u priči kad krene
putopis – kraljevstvo je u Nepalu abolirano 2008, a nestankom kraljevstva u
samom Nepalu, nestalo je i ono u Lo-Mustangu. Otud naziv kampanje – Izgubljeno
kraljevstvo, Lost Kingdom.
I zaista je
Lost Kingdom!
Nakon leta
za Katmandu, truckanja do Pokare i bauljanja do Jomsoma, iz tog grada kreće
završni dio ekspedicije prema naselju Lo Manthang, glavnom gradu Loa, na visini
od oko 4.000 metara – visina slična Pamiru lani. Da pravo kažem, nisam lud ni
za hodanjem a još manje za planinarenjem. Zanimaju me PRIČE i FOTOGRAFIJE.
Stoga je meni osobno najdraži način putovanja unajmljeni Land Cruiser, Pajero
ili UAZ, ali ovaj put to neće biti posve moguće. 
Lo-Mustang
jednostavno nema cesta. Iako će se dio puta nadam se, pokriti terencem ili čak
ponijem (mali tibetanski konji, poniji), neke dijelove morat ćemo pješačiti. 
Tko smo to
mi? Kao i lani na uspješnu ekspediciju na Pamir, planiram ići s Francoisom, frendom iz
Francuske. Ako Francois bude morao odustati – idem sam ili u nekoj drugoj
kombinaciji. Francois je inače super lik, lani je bio odličan partner, svakako
bi volio ići s njim, stvari bi bile nekoliko puta lakše (uglavnom psihološki). Ovo smo ja i Francois u Kirgistanu, s tradicionalnim kirgiskim kapama.

post. Valjda kao nekad izvještaje o Neil Armstrongu. Dojam nestvarnosti je,
pretpostavljam, vrlo sličan. Tako dalek od naše svakodnevnice i vlastitih
iskustava
Please take my money (citaj: hocu iducu kampanju)
Olegže meni je to bio super putopis!
Svaka čast, svake lipe
je vrijedilo
Jedva čekam novu kampanju
Fala Oleg, bilo je fakat
odlično! Nadam se nekom novom putopisu u budućnosti
Dakle Hrvatska do
Pamira... Tko je sudjelovao i pratio, obogatio se fantastičnim fotkama i
saznanjima i osjeća se, zacijelo, kao i ja nevjerojatno privilegiran.OK SKEPTICI JESAM LI VAS UVJERIO??!!
:o)
Kad se ide?
Plan je kolovoz 2016. Nitko normalan, inače, ne ide u
Nepal u kolovozu, jer je tad sezona monsuna u snazi, kišno je, vlažno i
bezveze. Za posjete Nepalu kolovoz je kao nama siječanj – dno sezone. Međutim,
kako sam napomenuo, ovo ne važi za Mustang, ili barem ne u tolikoj mjeri, jer
je ova neobična provincija u sjeni Himalaja i ne zahvaća je monsun.
Zašto biste
trebali podržati ovu kampanju?
Zato što ti
osobno koji ovo čitaš nećeš nikad u životu otići tamo. Ne zanima te, ne da ti se, daleko je.... IPAK, imaš priliku sudjelovati u odlasku u Izgubljeno
kraljevstvo – preko ove kampanje! Neka atom tebe ipak ide tamo, atom zvan
dolar, kuna, dojčmarka. Gledat ćeš fotke, postove odande i pomisiliti ""i
djelić mene je sad tamo u toj pripizdini"". 
Ako spadaš u
1% onih koji planiraju ići, ali negdje u budućnosti, onda se opet isplati
sudjelovati u kampanji jer čitat ćeš putopisne opaske pa ćeš na temelju njih
bolje isplanirati svoj vlastiti put i imat ćeš kvalitetnu fotku da te podsjeća
na nešto gdje si i sam bio, tj bit ćeš jednom kada i ako odeš tamo. 





Što se
dobije zauzvrat, šta ima od perkova?
Ovo je
jednostavna kampanja i nema puno perkova.
16 doloresa -
Fotopis
Za 16 dolara (popust u odnosu na Pamir lani) dobiješ 
putopis, sve postove i fotke koje ću stavljati kao pripremu i sa samog
putovanja. Računam dosta pisati i u pripremnoj fazi, tema je zaista zanimljiva
i ima materijala. Naravno, i sa samog lica mjesta ću stavljati fotke, putopisne
crtice i slično. Lani s Pamira bilo je ukupno preko 200 fotki i 110.000 znakova
teksta – dakle teksta za omanji roman! 
Ovo s putopisom mislim
riješiti vrlo jednostavno. Tko uplati 16 dolara, jednostavno ću ga dodati u posebnu zatvorenu grupu na Facebooku za ovaj projekt, i postove za one koji su pomogli kampanju
učiniti vidljivima grupi ""pomagača"" da ih oni gledaju i da im
osvježe dan, a drugi ne vide. Putopis i fotke neće biti Public! 
Nije neka sigurnost s pet
ključeva PGP-a, OIB-om i identifikacijom mrežnice, nego jednostavno, fleksibilno
i za korisnika potpuno bezbolno. Kad uplatiš 16 dolara za putopis na Fejsu,
više NE TREBAŠ URADITI NIŠTA, samo budi na Fejsu, imam tvoje ime i ideš na
distro listu za odgovarajuće Fejs postove vezane s putopisom i to je to. Ne može
lakše.
Sjedit ćeš sredinom kolovoza
na Jadranu i dignuti Fejs ""ajd baš da vidim šta ima"" a tamo – postovi
s Himalaje, neka budala gladan i smrznut u nekim vrletima. LOL! I još mora
fotkati jer je obećao u kampanji. Nasmiješ se idiotu i nastaviš pržiti na
suncu, pijuć koktel i gledajuć komade.
Ovaj model isti je kao za
lanjsku ekspediciju na Pamir i funkcionirao je odlično. Cijena perka je niža
nego lani!
50 doloresa –
Fotopis F+
Isto kao fotopis,
samo za one koji mogu i žele pomoći malo više! Prošli put sam u ovom
rangu nudio Fotopis + pivo, ali onda se desilo sljedeće – nakon povratka kad
sam ponudio ljudima da se nađemo i ""odradimo"" dogovoreno pivo koje im
pripada, svi su u nekoj gužvi, ovo, ono, a ja sam zapravo sve s terena
ispričao, i fotke stavio, već u putopisu. Tako da je to s pivom ispalo malo
promašeno. 
U svakom slučaju –
budući da je 16 dolara zbilja sitna lova, tko želi pomoći s 50 – samo naprijed,
cijenim to, ekspedicija ima velike troškove.... a što se piva tiče, lako
se dogovorimo.
199 doloresa – Big
Picture
Lovatori i oni koji vole
umjetnost – ne znam kako će se pogledati u ogledalo ako ne uzmu ovaj jaki perk
od 199 dolara... uspješni startupi, njihovi pokretači, investitori, vlasnici
iPhonea, kapitalisti, neoliberali, paleoanarhisti, ljubitelji Tesli, mrzitelji
Tesli, poduzetnici, saborski zastupnici, socijalisti, kriminalci.... a svih njih ima među
mojim frendovima.... KGB ZNA da ovo čitate.... hehe.... 
U sklopu tog perka dobije se
divna slika za staviti na zid – poput ovih koje vidite na fotografijama iznad i
ispod ovog pasusa.
Slike s fotografija dio su
mog projekta Without People – nisu s Pamira niti iz Mustanga, već samo
ilustracija kako slika ovog formata, koja je dio perka, izgleda. Ovo doli je
surovi neoliberal Nikša i njegova slika za Without People u gepeku.
Kliknite gore na tab
Gallery, tamo je par primjera mojih fotografija, koje NISU iz Mustanga – logično, jer
tamo tek trebam otići – ali koje vam daju neku ideju kakav krajolik očekujem i
kakav tip fotografija planiram napraviti. Ovo su inače moje fotografije iz
Pamira, Armenije, Kazahstana, Tajlanda, Irske, Turske, Kalifornije i Nevade (SAD), s
lokacija donekle sličnih Mustangu, samo da vam da neku ideju.
499
doloresa – Neoliberal Bastard
Ovo je corporate package – imaš firmu, aute, robote, virtualne điđe, datacentre, softvere, ekstraprofite, saprofite? ...aj ne škrtari, pokaži da si baja! S ovim perkom ću na lokaciju uzeti i vaše predmete, majice, proizvode, i napraviti par reklamnih slika na licu mjesta, podijeliti domorocima ili nešto slično. Paket uključuje naravno praćenje same kampanje (za koliko god ljudi unutar firme želite), sliku velikog formata za na zid i po želji reklamiranje proizvoda/kompanije na licu mjesta.Ovo je legenda Zafar, u Dušanbeu, s majicom muzeja Marco Polo Korčula. (Zafar se čudio simbolu na majici, nikad nije vidio sidro!) 
Ovo je profesor Tursunbay, u selu Aličur, s brendiranom busolom Marco Polo.
999 doloresa – Kralj
Loa
Ovaj je perk dostupan samo
jedan. Uključuje mogućnost imenovanja cijele ekspedicije po vašoj tvrtci, promo
fotke s logićima firme uz put, zastave, majice, slikanje kraj Annapurne u
majici s korporativnim logom... plus sve u ovom prethodnom perku (slika za na
zid, putopis itd).
Dio skupljene love donirat
ću nekoj udruzi za stradale od potresa u Nepalu, po svom odabiru!*************************

Što
s lovom ako ne odem?
Imam namjeru otići u Mustang
kad-tad, dakle jedini realni problem koji se može dogoditi jest odgoda puta
zbog nečega, nemam pojma čega. Ako se baš desi da iz bilo kojeg razloga –
geopolitičkog, zdravstvenog... nikako ne mogu u Mustang... onda mogu obećati da
ću sredstva po vrlo sličnom planu iskoristiti za neki sličan projekt, možda čak
i zanimljiviji. Myanmar (Burma), Bolivija, Jakutija, Osetija, Transnistria, neka izgubljena, ali zanimljiva rupetina u svakom slučaju...
Isto vrijedi i ako se ne
ispuni financijski cilj. Ekspedicija u Mustang vrlo je skupa. Ako se ne
skupi ciljani iznos – putopis će biti s neke druge, skromnije lokacije. U
svakom slučaju – bit će zanimljivo....
English
summary
Hi, this is a campaign to
get funding for expedition to Mustang province in Nepal, the seat of the former
Kingdom of Lo. This Kingdom is no more, it was abolished along with Kingdom of
Nepal itself, back in 2008. 
The project is in Croatian,
because I plan to go there and write travelogue in Croatian language, for my
Croat readers (and others who understand Croatian). I will also post high
quality photos – in fact, photos are the main motivation to go there. So, since
photos do not require any translation – if you like nice photos you can support
the campaign too... thanks.Rijeka Pjanž - granica s Afganistanom",10.0,0,"14 Campaigns

<p>BlackBoard, Northwestern University’s Black student magazine, serves as an open forum for student expression. The curators of the magazine hope to challenge the audience to think critically in order to move out of orthodox thought processes. Ubuntu, “I am because we are,” is the slogan of the magazine that acts as a symbol for a unified Black community, for we realize that without honoring all of our intricate and diverse identities, we have nothing. With a determined staff and dedicated board, this publication will provide a world of knowledge and food for thought on a consistent basis.</p>
<p>BlackBoard’s goals are:</p>
<p>To fill the void in the Black community most publications cannot reach. BlackBoard will provide the campus and surrounding areas with a perspective of the Black Community they would not normally see. And give voice to a Black community, which is usually misunderstood.</p>
<p>To inform readers with current news, thoughts, ideas and themes in a timely fashion following a sound journalism code of ethics. BlackBoard will spread the thoughts and ideas of the community to the community through open communication following the guidelines of quality journalism, codes and ethics.</p>
<p>To become a leading source of information for all marginalized people on Northwestern’s campus to look forward to. BlackBoard will go beyond the boundaries of Northwestern’s campus to find the intersectional and inclusive voice that so needs to be heard.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>BlackBoard was brought back to NU's campus in Spring 2016, and since then we've been telling the organic stories of Black students on campus - unfiltered and not diluted. We're ready to take the next step and release our print magazine this Fall quarter and, of course, that's a financial cost. Please support Black narratives on campus and donate!</p>

I am 54 years young and keep getting better like aged wine. I was born in Cleveland, Ohio, and graduated from John F. Kennedy High class of '76, majored in Accounting and Finance at the University of Cincinnati. I moved to Baltimore, MD in 1980 landing a career with the Federal Government for the past 24 years and counting, a member of New Psalmist Baptist Church since 1996 where I teach new members class and serve on several other ministries. I am happily married with seven children, five grandchildren, and a mentor to a host of other young men.</p><p>I interact with people almost 24/7, which has caused me to understand the importance of relationships and how they play a major part in shaping a person self-esteem. After feeling and seeing the effects of divorce, I have witnessed how it can cause a negative effect on all parties involved, if you do not seek God's healing hand. In my life, it always seemed liked someone was always being thrown away or as we say, ""Kicked to the curb"". But, the LORD began to speak to me about how much value he has placed in all our lives, and that began to help change my behavior. Exdous19:5 says ""Now therefore, if ye will obey My voice indeed, and keep My covenant, <strong>then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto Me above all people:</strong> for all the earth is Mine."" While growing up, I heard people say, ""One man's trash is another man's treasure."" I know people are not trash, but they are treasures just waiting to be discovered. We have to allow God's Words about us, to determine who we are and not let how people treat us shape our value.</p><p>I have taught and studied the Bible for years but had trouble trying to apply the teaching so that I could get the victory that God promised in every situation. 2 Corinthians 2:14 says <strong>""Now thanks be to God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ,</strong> and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place."" It's has become my driving passion to see people win in every situation just like God has taught me how to. When I got the revelation that the understanding comes in the doing of the word and not just in the studying. Most of us want to understand first and than we are willing to do, but that is how we get this faith principle backwards. It is in the doing first without understanding that pleases God, because that means you are just taking Him at His Word. A great example of this principle is when you were little and you asked your parents for something you want, you never tried to take the time to figure how they would do it; you just trust that your parents would do what you asked them. So you just begin to by faith do what they asked you do like your home work or cleaning up your room, because you know your gift was on the way. Why because they loved you. Faith, which is trusting God, is a heart thing, not a head thing.</p><p>Galatians 5:6 says, ""For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision avails anything, <strong>but faith working through love.""</strong> What cause faith to work is what you know in your heart about others value, if you want to find the treasure in your mate or even in yourself. You need  to use the definition of love that the Bible talks about. It  is not so much this warm fuzzy feeling but is just a commitment to always do good and when we perform this way faithfully the feelings will come. Our feelings can play tricks on us, but there is help. I know there is help because I have been changed by doing what the word says. In John 13:34 Jesus said, ""A new commandment I give to you, <strong>that you love one another; as I have loved you,</strong> that you also love one another."" Because it is a commandment from the Lord, He has to equip me to be able to do it. My passion is to help you love in such a way that your love for people will release any treasure that has been buried in them. The whole key to finding a treasure in people is to love people like Jesus loves you.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; How You Can Help</h3><p>I have step out on faith on this project from start to finish. To be honest, I laughed when God told me to write a book about relationships. I asked the question, ""Why me?"" His answer was' ""I need someone to be transparent about their ups and downs in their relationships without always trying to come out looking or smelling like a rose."" Part of the downs have cost me a whole lot of money and hurt. I know you heard the saying, ""It's cheaper to keep her""; they are right about that, and let the church say, ""Amen"". I have managed to save some money through all my mistakes, but to put the project out, like the Lord said, ""With the Spirit of excellence"", it""s going to cost upwards of $7000.00.</p><p>We have found a great publishing company that has everything we need to get everything done in one place. I have worked on this project for three years and still had to deal with everything else that was coming at me. But the Lord said that now is the time to get it out there because there are so many hurting people who need this word. I could wait and  try to save the money in a couple of years, but it seems like the economy is getting worse. But I believe I can find a few people who will step out on faith with a love gift of $20 or more in order to receive my book in advance and get some wonderful perks for their help. You will be helping to change lives, because it has already started to help the people I have shared these simple principles with. The release date will be the month of March 2014.

<p><strong>INTRODUCTION, GOALS and WELCOME</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">It is very exciting to start on this journey of artistic communion through Indiegogo. Your support and participation will guarantee the life of this book concretely but will also guarantee a collective life both culturally and spiritually.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">My goal is also to broaden the scope and touch of poetry. Words are living things that all mankind are gifted with whether they be utilitarian, carefully parsed like precious jewels or issued forth like weaponry or soothing medicine. I would like to build, mine and cultivate this richness and share the joy in it all with others.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">The funds given and raised by this campaign will go towards the production and creation of the book's physical first edition from my recently completed manuscript. In addition, a selection of my own photographic pieces will be included to stretch the boundaries of the ordinary poetic publication.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Equally important is the community's moral support and the sharing of this campaign to your friends, colleagues, loved ones, acquaintances, doctors, lawyers, butchers, bakers and candlestick makers.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Any funds over the goal will be used for further production and reproduction costs as well as an audio book version of a portion or all of the book.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Thank you for lighting upon this campaign and for taking the time to read and discover it!</p>

<em><br/></em>Excerpt from<strong> ""Understanding The Loss of a Daughter On Graduation Night, Five Hours Past""</strong><br/><br/>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div> I am a nomad. Yet I have always had an obsessive need to communicate - to connect. Perhaps one could say that it’s rooted in family history; a mother thing – issues resulting from early years of neglect and an absent father or perhaps better, call it a human thing – issues steeped in as many years and more of being and trying to be a human being: loves and losses, communities and isolation, friendships and jealousies, marginalization, objects, people, failure, celebration and joy.</div>
<p> I have made my way and continue to make my way through a spectrum of communicative arts: music, dance, song, drama, writing, conducting, directing, speaking and translation. For the longest time this variety was a source of anxiety – I felt I needed to choose. And then I realized that each of these is a shimmering piece of a mosaic that the glue of my soul stretches, bends and holds firmly yet pliantly in place to maintain the integrity of my whole being.</p>
<p> As a child I wrote for hours. Then singing came as a boy soprano in the cathedrals of Italy then London. And I wrote. Then came the US and the piano, the violin, concerts and more concerts. And still I wrote. By then writing was like breathing, as was singing, playing music and dancing. More music, more concerts, more living: Paris, Moscow, Helsinki, Rome, Tangiers, Marrakech and the deserts of North Africa. Then came acting: Mike Leigh, the Broadway stage and the Hollywood sets of Universal, Paramount and Spielberg: this new, more external kind of drama. Drama, with which you say things you have to say, say things you need to say and don’t say things and yet those things speak loudest of all.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""Table of Contents"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-gwEFq8XKOWI/UJtCwFhifhI/AAAAAAAAABU/XOShTOWvozs/s783/FITS+%26+STARTS+TOC+Effect.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: text-bottom; margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px;""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> And through it all my writing has remained a constant. In the midst of this polymathic timeline poetry revealed itself with full force – the poems of <strong><em>Philip Levine</em></strong>, <strong><em>Pablo Neruda</em> </strong>and <strong><em>James Wright</em></strong> moved me and molded me. The beauty of <strong><em>Larry Levis</em></strong> and the soul-stirring <em>duende</em> of <strong><em>Federico Garcia Lorca</em></strong> shook me and I found a home. Each word, the one preceding it and the one following, chosen and conjured like musical notes for some haunting melody or striking chord – complete with silences, accents, conflict and resolution.</p>
<p> Writing for me is a many-limbed appendage that <em>is</em> music - that sings, that dances or yearns to - that is discursively meditative and inclusive and holds my breath and a million or more of other distinctly, particular breaths. My writing is a collective of breaths swirling in my rib cage informed by a thousand different words, a thousand different notes and a thousand different gestures and movements.</p>
<p> “FITS &amp; STARTS” is the fruit - the organic product. These poems have issued forth in waves, sometimes in a constant trickle and more often than not, in halting tributaries: in fits of fever and starts of profound inspiration.</p>
<p>Thank you for sharing in this communion.</p>

It is very exciting to start on this journey of artistic communion through Indiegogo. Your support and participation will guarantee the life of this book concretely but will also guarantee a collective life both culturally and spiritually.
My goal is also to broaden the scope and touch of poetry. Words are living things that all mankind are gifted with whether they be utilitarian, carefully parsed like precious jewels or issued forth like weaponry or soothing medicine. I would like to build, mine and cultivate this richness and share the joy in it all with others.
The funds given and raised by this campaign will go towards the production and creation of the book's physical first edition from my recently completed manuscript. In addition, a selection of my own photographic pieces will be included to stretch the boundaries of the ordinary poetic publication.
Equally important is the community's moral support and the sharing of this campaign to your friends, colleagues, loved ones, acquaintances, doctors, lawyers, butchers, bakers and candlestick makers.
Any funds over the goal will be used for further production and reproduction costs as well as an audio book version of a portion or all of the book.
Thank you for lighting upon this campaign and for taking the time to read and discover it!

  I am sent reeling reckless
 Through the corridors of stars, 
 Through the bloodless veins
 Of rural America:
 
Past a clergy of convenience stores
Into the beautiful light of oncoming traffic. 
North Platte, Nebraska and frost. Frost.
And the luminescence of jewels
And the mean temperature of souls. 
 

Excerpt from ""Understanding The Loss of a Daughter On Graduation Night, Five Hours Past""

 
 I am a nomad. Yet I have always had an obsessive need to communicate - to connect. Perhaps one could say that it’s rooted in family history; a mother thing – issues resulting from early years of neglect and an absent father or perhaps better, call it a human thing – issues steeped in as many years and more of being and trying to be a human being: loves and losses, communities and isolation, friendships and jealousies, marginalization, objects, people, failure, celebration and joy.
 I have made my way and continue to make my way through a spectrum of communicative arts: music, dance, song, drama, writing, conducting, directing, speaking and translation. For the longest time this variety was a source of anxiety – I felt I needed to choose. And then I realized that each of these is a shimmering piece of a mosaic that the glue of my soul stretches, bends and holds firmly yet pliantly in place to maintain the integrity of my whole being.
 As a child I wrote for hours. Then singing came as a boy soprano in the cathedrals of Italy then London. And I wrote. Then came the US and the piano, the violin, concerts and more concerts. And still I wrote. By then writing was like breathing, as was singing, playing music and dancing. More music, more concerts, more living: Paris, Moscow, Helsinki, Rome, Tangiers, Marrakech and the deserts of North Africa. Then came acting: Mike Leigh, the Broadway stage and the Hollywood sets of Universal, Paramount and Spielberg: this new, more external kind of drama. Drama, with which you say things you have to say, say things you need to say and don’t say things and yet those things speak loudest of all.
 

 
 And through it all my writing has remained a constant. In the midst of this polymathic timeline poetry revealed itself with full force – the poems of Philip Levine, Pablo Neruda and James Wright moved me and molded me. The beauty of Larry Levis and the soul-stirring duende of Federico Garcia Lorca shook me and I found a home. Each word, the one preceding it and the one following, chosen and conjured like musical notes for some haunting melody or striking chord – complete with silences, accents, conflict and resolution.
 Writing for me is a many-limbed appendage that is music - that sings, that dances or yearns to - that is discursively meditative and inclusive and holds my breath and a million or more of other distinctly, particular breaths. My writing is a collective of breaths swirling in my rib cage informed by a thousand different words, a thousand different notes and a thousand different gestures and movements.
 “FITS & STARTS” is the fruit - the organic product. These poems have issued forth in waves, sometimes in a constant trickle and more often than not, in halting tributaries: in fits of fever and starts of profound inspiration.
Thank you for sharing in this communion.
 - Juan-Paolo Perre

<p><em>""The country is torn. Families are broken. A corrupted government holds all the power. Fear has filled every nook and cranny, every broken-hearted citizen, and chased the hopes and dreams from the people. In the midst of it all, Jesse and her brother lead a revolution. Just two children, they will have to rebuild their parents' rebel army if they ever hope to justify their deaths. A battle is coming, whether they're ready or not. Their only hope is to be <strong>BOLD.</strong>""</em></p>
<p><em><br/></em>Above is the back-page synopsis for my book, <em>Breaking Shadows: Bold</em>. This book, the first in a series of four, is a Dystopian Christian Speculative Fiction novel for young adults. I have written in this genre for about seven years now. It's what I love, and what I feel God has called me to do. </p>
<p>I've spent much of my short life as a pastor's daughter, traveling across the country, following wherever God called us. As a family, we moved from Arizona to Maryland in our white Chevy Astro van, giving away everything we owned that wouldn't fit inside. After a year in the DC area, we moved to Philadelphia where we stayed another year for my dad's internship in a large local church. We had thought we would probably return to Arizona and plant a church there, but God had other plans. Suddenly, we were moving to New York City, where we planted a church and spent nearly five years of our lives watching it grow. When my father's health took a bad turn, we moved again to Akron, Ohio, for a less stressful pastoring job.</p>
<p>After a series of unfortunate and heartbreaking events, our family wound up running an ice cream and barbeque shop near downtown Akron. It required unbelievable sacrifice to stay afloat in a bad economy. During these last few years, when I'm not retraining the thoroughbred racehorse given to me, I've been writing. It has been my outlet. It is how I deal with the stress and hardships we, as a family, have had to endure. From the pain of these trials came <em>Bold</em>, a story about boldly enduring whatever may come, fighting forward no matter the cost, because there is always hope in the fact that God's plan is good, and it <em>will </em>be finished... whether you live to see it or not.</p>
<p>I never intended on publishing, but after sharing this story with my family, friends, schoolmates, friends of friends, and others, I was overwhelmed by the encouragement I received and constant requests for publication. I would always laugh and backhand the idea, but it just kept coming up. Finally, after much prayer and thought, discussion with teachers and friends, and what I can only describe as God's hand opening and closing doors, I agreed to take a leap of faith and start talking with publishers. To my shock and amazement, the very first company I contacted, Mascot Books, got back to me about my query within 24 hours. Since then, they have agreed to publish this book with me. It's still hard to believe, as I never dreamed I would make it this far. But, the journey isn't over yet.</p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>With Mascot Books, I have a huge opportunity for a very small investment. But with my family struggling to survive as small business owners in this sluggish economy, and I myself nothing but a poor college student, even a small investment is more than I have. For the final step in the publication process, I must pay for the first run of prints. This is the only cost passed down to me in this project, but it is a rather hefty one that I am seeking help for funding.</p>
<p>Mascot recommends a first run of 1,000-2,000 books. This is a fairly conservative number and a short enough run that risk is lowered, but high enough that they can really push to distribute it through all of their outlets. With a run of this size, they would be able to push out to Amazon, Barnes &amp; Noble, Books-A-Million, and most of the other large book retailers in the country.</p>
<p>For a first run of books, I will only be paying for the minimal cost of production. Distribution and marketing are covered by Mascot. The anticipated production cost per unit will be approximately $4-$5. This price fluctuates with the number of units ordered. Whatever funding I receive will be solely for purchasing this first run. I have estimated low, knowing it is unlikely I will receive the funding for a full run of 2,000. If my goal is met, I will be able to put out approximately 1,000 books, with anything above my goal being put towards a larger run.</p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>This book has come a very long way. My hope is that it can continue to go forward, with God's grace and your help. I truly feel God has called me to write, and to share this book and others with the world. Every writer has a story, one only they can tell. This is mine, and I only pray that it will make it into book form.</p>
<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3>
<p>I understand we are all feeling the crunch of hard economic times, especially in an election year. My family and I certainly are or there would be no need for this campaign. In light of this, I know not everyone can help. Just know that every contribution means the world to me as I struggle to obey God's calling for my life. If you would like to help, but do not have the means to give financially, please share this with your friends and family. Help me reach my goal by reaching out to those that may be able to help.</p>
<p> </p>

Above is the back-page synopsis for my book, Breaking Shadows: Bold. This book, the first in a series of four, is a Dystopian Christian Speculative Fiction novel for young adults. I have written in this genre for about seven years now. It's what I love, and what I feel God has called me to do. 
I've spent much of my short life as a pastor's daughter, traveling across the country, following wherever God called us. As a family, we moved from Arizona to Maryland in our white Chevy Astro van, giving away everything we owned that wouldn't fit inside. After a year in the DC area, we moved to Philadelphia where we stayed another year for my dad's internship in a large local church. We had thought we would probably return to Arizona and plant a church there, but God had other plans. Suddenly, we were moving to New York City, where we planted a church and spent nearly five years of our lives watching it grow. When my father's health took a bad turn, we moved again to Akron, Ohio, for a less stressful pastoring job.
After a series of unfortunate and heartbreaking events, our family wound up running an ice cream and barbeque shop near downtown Akron. It required unbelievable sacrifice to stay afloat in a bad economy. During these last few years, when I'm not retraining the thoroughbred racehorse given to me, I've been writing. It has been my outlet. It is how I deal with the stress and hardships we, as a family, have had to endure. From the pain of these trials came Bold, a story about boldly enduring whatever may come, fighting forward no matter the cost, because there is always hope in the fact that God's plan is good, and it will be finished... whether you live to see it or not.
I never intended on publishing, but after sharing this story with my family, friends, schoolmates, friends of friends, and others, I was overwhelmed by the encouragement I received and constant requests for publication. I would always laugh and backhand the idea, but it just kept coming up. Finally, after much prayer and thought, discussion with teachers and friends, and what I can only describe as God's hand opening and closing doors, I agreed to take a leap of faith and start talking with publishers. To my shock and amazement, the very first company I contacted, Mascot Books, got back to me about my query within 24 hours. Since then, they have agreed to publish this book with me. It's still hard to believe, as I never dreamed I would make it this far. But, the journey isn't over yet.
What We Need & What You Get
With Mascot Books, I have a huge opportunity for a very small investment. But with my family struggling to survive as small business owners in this sluggish economy, and I myself nothing but a poor college student, even a small investment is more than I have. For the final step in the publication process, I must pay for the first run of prints. This is the only cost passed down to me in this project, but it is a rather hefty one that I am seeking help for funding.
Mascot recommends a first run of 1,000-2,000 books. This is a fairly conservative number and a short enough run that risk is lowered, but high enough that they can really push to distribute it through all of their outlets. With a run of this size, they would be able to push out to Amazon, Barnes & Noble, Books-A-Million, and most of the other large book retailers in the country.
For a first run of books, I will only be paying for the minimal cost of production. Distribution and marketing are covered by Mascot. The anticipated production cost per unit will be approximately $4-$5. This price fluctuates with the number of units ordered. Whatever funding I receive will be solely for purchasing this first run. I have estimated low, knowing it is unlikely I will receive the funding for a full run of 2,000. If my goal is met, I will be able to put out approximately 1,000 books, with anything above my goal being put towards a larger run.
The Impact
This book has come a very long way. My hope is that it can continue to go forward, with God's grace and your help. I truly feel God has called me to write, and to share this book and others with the world. Every writer has a story, one only they can tell. This is mine, and I only pray that it will make it into book form.
Other Ways You Can Help
I understand we are all feeling the crunch of hard economic times, especially in an election year. My family and I certainly are or there would be no need for this campaign. In light of this, I know not everyone can help. Just know that every contribution means the world to me as I struggle to obey God's calling for my life. If you would like to help, but do not have the means to give financially, please share this with your friends and family. Help me reach my goal by reaching out to those that may be able to help.

<p>Set in the Oz universe, and gathering some of the darker elements of the original novels, the Ozite Cycle follows Thea Gale, a young descendant of Dorothy, as she navigates a world of drugs, arms running, and attempted genocide.

Begrudgingly, Felix takes it upon himself to whip his buddy into shape, and for good reason: Something's coming. They have to be ready before the other metahumans show up. Because if they aren't, then they won't be prepared for the war to come. A war on a scale humanity has never experienced before. What begins as a light-hearted adventure soon catapults into a fast-paced thrill ride, complete with shocking revelations, double crosses, and super-powered battles.</p>
<p><strong>Who am I?</strong></p>
<p>I'm Cy Cross, a soon graduating senior in highschool. I've always had a fascination with superheroes and a love for writing, and this project is the accumulation of two of my favorite things in the world!</p>
<p>I've been working on the Felix Wright project for around two and a half years, all while balancing out school, a part-time job, being the secretary of a non-profit organization, and most recently a podcast. I have an intense passion for storytelling, one that has gotten me through many long nights, and I couldn't be happier to finally have the opportunity to share Felix's journey with you all. I just need to get the novel edited first!</p>
<p><strong>Why do I need your money?</strong></p>
<p>I asked my editor how much it would cost me to edit A Sidekick's Story. This was his response:</p>
<p>""It's now 99,868 words which is app 399.47 pages. A pretty big book.<br/><br/> Before your discount, the price is $10 ea. for the first 200 pages.<br/> $8.00 per page for the next 200.<br/><br/> Sub total: $2000 + $1600 = $3,600.<br/><br/> 15% discount: $540.<br/><br/> Total: $<strong>3060</strong>.""</p>
<p>My editor and I have broken down the 3060 payment into three gaps--1020, 2040, and finally 3060. This campaign is aiming to pay the first fee so my editor and I can start the editing process, but if we can get everything done in one go I would be delighted.</p>
<p>The extra 500 is going to Steven Sookraj, the artist of the series. I am also aiming to give him an extra 200 out of my pockets. As many of you know, he is giving me an amazing deal, as sometimes the cover art for novels alone amount to over 1000 dollars, and I would like to pay him much more if we can exceed over 3560.</p>

<p>Once the editing process has started, there will be a 6 month period where the Steve, the editor and I will work ferociously on finishing the project. Once that 6 month period is over, Felix Wright will be ready for publication, and you'll recieve the novel!</p>
<p>If you can't afford to let go if any cash at the moment, but you still want to help, never underestimate the power of social networking.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I'm Brandy Miller, co-founder of the Elko County Writers.  We started in January of 2013 with five members and a dream: to help other writers connect, make friends, get helpful critiques and useful feedback.  So far, I've been funding the club out of my own money.  We've grown from the original 5 to 23, and we're still growing.  We have writers of all experience levels, from people who have never written anything outside of school to people who are already published authors.  It's a great group and provides a resource that is greatly lacking in rural northeastern Nevada.</p>
<p>However, to get more exposure and more help, we need to become legitimate. We need to become a registered 501(c)(3) organization. We also need to register our name, get registered with the Chamber of Commerce so that we can access their marketing platforms, and we can expand.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Elko County is the biggest county in the United States. It takes 3 hours to drive to the nearest big cities of Twin Falls or Salt Lake City, and 8 hours to get to Las Vegas.  It's hard for writers in Elko County to connect with one another, to bring in the kind of resources that writers in major metropolitan areas often have directly at their fingertips.  We want to help those writers who live right here in this county to get the help they need to become the best writers they can, and we need YOUR help to do it.</p>

<p><b>Who We Are </b></p>
<p>We recently launched a Philanthropy news website called <a href=""http://www.PhilanthropistList.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.PhilanthropistList.com</a> that
promotes philanthropy, charity, and acts of kindness to help introduce others
to the world of philanthropy and giving. The intention of PhilanthropistList.com
is that we want to raise the awareness that ANYONE can be a philanthropist. </p>
<p>Becoming a philanthropist doesn’t mean you have to be rich,
successful or have a lot of money. A philanthropist is one who gives regardless
of net worth or social status; this could be donating your time, knowledge,
skills or personal belongings that you might not need.  </p>
<p>The goal of PhilanthropistList.com is to introduce newcomers
— especially younger people — to the act of philanthropy and giving. Helping
improve the quality of life for others, supporting causes through volunteering,
and teaching others what you know can be this type of person. The selfless act
of giving without getting anything in return is a great satisfaction and the
message that the Philanthropist List wants to send out.</p><p>The practice of philanthropy, donating to good causes and lending
a helping hand to others continues today, but the Philanthropist List wants to
inspire even more people to give and promote the welfare of others through its
philanthropy news website.</p>
<p>As the founder of Philanthropist List, I am asking for funding
to help grow this great website and introduce others to the world of
philanthropy.</p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p><b>Technical Help</b> - This campaign is to
     help sustain and grow this recently launched website, <a href=""http://www.Philanthropist.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.Philanthropist.com</a> into a platform
     that encourages others to give through its inspiring news stories, tips
     &amp; advice, and ideas on how to give regardless of social status or net
     worth. In order to do this, the website needs to be maintained and hosted
     on high quality web hosting and servers to keep the site running smoothly.
     As our website continues to grow, we need funding to upgrade our web hosting
     and servers. We need to hire technical staff, such as system and network
     administrators to keep the site up and running and web developers to upgrade
     the features and functionality of the website.<b><br/><br/>Writers and Researchers</b> - The website
     started with one writer and just recently added another.  Both
     writers voluntarily contribute philanthropy articles through their acts of
     kindness and giving. We would eventually like to compensate our writers
     for their efforts and also add more writers to produce more insightful and
     intuitive content for the website. We are looking for seed funding to hire
     more writers. Right now our writers are volunteers to keep costs down, but
     we know we need to hire more writers to produce more articles to keep this
     site going. <br/><b><br/>Marketing &amp; Advertising</b> – The
     founder of the Philanthropist List is an experienced Digital Marketing
     professional, but he can’t do the marketing and advertising alone. He
     needs the help of product marketing managers, advertising &amp; marketing
     campaign managers, and recruitment marketing managers to help expose and
     bring more people to the website.<br/><b><br/>Business Analysts and Project Managers</b>
     – In order to grow the website we also need to hire business analysts and
     project managers to understand our structure, policies, and operations of our
     organization, and to recommend solutions that enable Philanthropist List
     to achieve its goals.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/615162/files/20140530154357-philanthropy-giving.GIF?1401489837"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><br/><p><b>Perks</b></p>

We recently launched a Philanthropy news website called www.PhilanthropistList.com that
promotes philanthropy, charity, and acts of kindness to help introduce others
to the world of philanthropy and giving. The intention of PhilanthropistList.com
is that we want to raise the awareness that ANYONE can be a philanthropist. 
Becoming a philanthropist doesn’t mean you have to be rich,
successful or have a lot of money. A philanthropist is one who gives regardless
of net worth or social status; this could be donating your time, knowledge,
skills or personal belongings that you might not need.  
The goal of PhilanthropistList.com is to introduce newcomers
— especially younger people — to the act of philanthropy and giving. Helping
improve the quality of life for others, supporting causes through volunteering,
and teaching others what you know can be this type of person. The selfless act
of giving without getting anything in return is a great satisfaction and the
message that the Philanthropist List wants to send out.The practice of philanthropy, donating to good causes and lending
a helping hand to others continues today, but the Philanthropist List wants to
inspire even more people to give and promote the welfare of others through its
philanthropy news website.
As the founder of Philanthropist List, I am asking for funding
to help grow this great website and introduce others to the world of
philanthropy.
What We Need & What You GetTechnical Help - This campaign is to
     help sustain and grow this recently launched website, www.Philanthropist.com into a platform
     that encourages others to give through its inspiring news stories, tips
     & advice, and ideas on how to give regardless of social status or net
     worth. In order to do this, the website needs to be maintained and hosted
     on high quality web hosting and servers to keep the site running smoothly.
     As our website continues to grow, we need funding to upgrade our web hosting
     and servers. We need to hire technical staff, such as system and network
     administrators to keep the site up and running and web developers to upgrade
     the features and functionality of the website.Writers and Researchers - The website
     started with one writer and just recently added another.  Both
     writers voluntarily contribute philanthropy articles through their acts of
     kindness and giving. We would eventually like to compensate our writers
     for their efforts and also add more writers to produce more insightful and
     intuitive content for the website. We are looking for seed funding to hire
     more writers. Right now our writers are volunteers to keep costs down, but
     we know we need to hire more writers to produce more articles to keep this
     site going. Marketing & Advertising – The
     founder of the Philanthropist List is an experienced Digital Marketing
     professional, but he can’t do the marketing and advertising alone. He
     needs the help of product marketing managers, advertising & marketing
     campaign managers, and recruitment marketing managers to help expose and
     bring more people to the website.Business Analysts and Project Managers
     – In order to grow the website we also need to hire business analysts and
     project managers to understand our structure, policies, and operations of our
     organization, and to recommend solutions that enable Philanthropist List
     to achieve its goals.Perks
$5 = A Virtual Thank You. A mention of your
generosity will be posted on our Facebook and Twitter pages.
$50 = A personalized Thank You card will be sent
to you by the Founder of the Philanthropist List.
$100 = You will be mentioned in our monthly
newsletter as a valued contributor to the website.
$500 = 
You will be mentioned in one of our articles to thank you for your
contribution.
$1000 = You will receive all of the above and
will have a permanent mention on a special section of our website called the
“Top Philanthropist List Contributors” page.
The Impact
Your contribution will be a philanthropic act of giving.
Your funding will be immensely important in helping grow PhilanthropistList.com
so that it can help encourage others to give to charities, good causes, ideas
and people in need. Your contributions will make a true and lasting impression
by inspiring more people to give and participate in philanthropy as an effort
to increase the well-being of humankind.

<h3>
<span style=""font-size: 10px;"">Hello. My name is Alixandrea La'terza Spateri. I am a twetny two year old writer from New York, and last year, I completeed my first novel, </span><em style=""font-size: 10px;"">Ambiguity</em><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">.</span>
</h3>
<p>The novel had been stewing in my head for years, especially after reading so much fiction that relied soley on the stereotypical, heterosexual, romance. I became frustrated. </p>
<p>I wanted to write something different. A book where characters have no names, unknown locations, and have their relationship be like everything else, ambigious. </p>
<p>It is my dream to get this book published. But like most writers just starting out, this seems like a near impossibility without the proper support and funding. I find my situation to be even more difficult, considering the content of my novel. A novel where ideas about aromanticism and asexuality and gender variations are a main component of my story.</p>
<p>With your help, I will be able to get the publishing process going and will also be able to improve on the first version of Ambiguity. </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>I have set a goal of $5,000, An amount of money that will be able to aid me in finding a professional editor, printing transcripts, and improving on my technology to make this process easier and far more refined in practice. </strong></p>
<p><strong>the money will go to such things as </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Paying my brilliant cover artist, Cristel Schoen.</li>
<li>Pritning transcripts to be sent off to publishers.</li>
<li>Hiring a professional editor.</li>
<li>Purchasing a new computer where my writing can be refined and stored, and I can download more writing programs.</li>
<li>Creating open forum discussions on the topics within the novel</li>
<li>And looking into self publishing possibilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also want to start a video series on the topics that can be insinuated from the novel, such as asexality, aromanticism, and gender variant people. Which are important things to get out there!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you support and donate to this project, there will be perks! Such as being mentioned in the novel, personally signed copies of the novel, and, if this thing grows like I so wish it does, a meeting with me where we can discuss a novela tailored to your liking.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I feel as though this novel will provide a positive resource for young adults, and adults alike. It will give people a chance to think outside of the heteronormative box, and also give people the chance to question the ways their own minds work and how they identitfy romance and love. There is an extreme lack of fictional literature that alludes to aromanticism, asxuality, and gender varient people. It will help people learn! And learning is the most important thing we can do.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you cannot finacially donate, which in this day and age is completely understandable, you can help by simply spreading the word! Share it on your facebook, tumblr, twitter, etc. Besides raising funds, I want to create a community where people can be creative and share their ideas in a very safe space.</p>

At the heart of why I write is, a need to live out the dream that I had when I was younger of being a successful writer on my own terms. After publishing two books in 2008 &amp; 2010, I wound up in a turbulent period in my life. I was frantically searching for work. I was in a malaise, one I thought I couldn't get out of. I even began to listen to the doubters, that my dream was a waste of time. But I slowly began to fight back, and wrote myself out of it. And the fruit of that four years of labor is PENNY CANDY RHYTHMS. A book of poetry that gives hope that we can all still hold onto the sweetness of life no matter what bitterness comes.<span><br/></span></p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Rundown.</h3><p><br/></p><ul>
<li>Specifically, I need $500. This cost will cover the first print run of a hundred copies of PENNY CANDY RHYTHMS, promotional materials, and shipping materials.</li>
<li>You'll get some nice perks if you donate, perks that I feel will tie in with the book's overall message. And besides, it's the least I can do to give love back to those who'll show love to me by donating.</li>
<li>To be upfront, if this campaign isn't successful, I still intend to publish the book, and all proceeds will go directly towards that. Nowhere else.</li>

<li>To me, this third book means a lot. It will be a triumphant moment because with all of the personal and professional struggles I've had, getting PENNY CANDY RHYTHMS published on my own imprint with your help will mean that you value my writing. And that you value what I bring to you and the rest of the community by supporting and helping 108 Press to grow this way.</li>
<li>I've already successfully self-published two books, 'lovestoned' and 'wife of the heart'. 'lovestoned' sold out its first run in two months. both books are still great sellers and have really touched people in a meaningful way.</li>
<li>We all have stories. Stories that get swept aside, overlooked or deemed not important. My writing is my way of continuing to tell my story without any hesitation or restraint. Because I believe that what lies in the pieces found in PENNY CANDY RHYTHMS is stuff that we've all seen, dealt with or have gone through. And that when you get down to it, our stories all have the common core to it. One that ultimately will help us get better and do better for ourselves and those around us.</li>

Because I believe that what lies in the pieces found in PENNY CANDY RHYTHMS is stuff that we've all seen, dealt with or have gone through. And that when you get down to it, our stories all have the common core to it. One that ultimately will help us get better and do better for ourselves and those around us.
Other Ways You Can HelpI do realize that in these times, folks may not be able to donate for different reasons. But you ask, what CAN I do?
It's simple. Share this campaign with your friends and loved ones. Even your co-workers. Spread the word!!!
And if you choose to spread the word, Indiegogo has some great share tools that you can use!!
I hope that this summation gives you an idea of how important getting PENNY CANDY RHYTHMS is to me. And I hope to have your support, however that may come. Thank you for taking the time to read this. Peace and love!!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</h3><p>  For 4 months, from June to October of 2013, I traveled 12.000mi across US while making over 300 tintype plates along the way.  Each tintype is not only unique simply by the nature of the process, but each one also comes with a set of memories that surround it's creation.  A story of the journey will be combined into an illustrated memoir-style book told in 'passages' - a page or so of writing to accompany each image.  As rewards for your contributions you will own the original draft of that passage, getting a chance to read it well before the book is published, AND the original plate that goes with it!  Each passage and plate will be personally signed.<br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">More About the Book<br/>

  For 4 months, from June to October of 2013, I traveled 12.000mi across US while making over 300 tintype plates along the way.  Each tintype is not only unique simply by the nature of the process, but each one also comes with a set of memories that surround it's creation.  A story of the journey will be combined into an illustrated memoir-style book told in 'passages' - a page or so of writing to accompany each image.  As rewards for your contributions you will own the original draft of that passage, getting a chance to read it well before the book is published, AND the original plate that goes with it!  Each passage and plate will be personally signed.More About the Book

<h3>Strength From Within: Stories of Recovery to Fund Asbury House</h3>
<p>Recovery from addiction requires strength, and through strength can come recovery. But not all strengths are the same, nor are all addictions. Strength From Within aims to examine addiction and recovery through the lens of fantasy. With fifteen stories of bravery, strength and resilience in the face of addiction and recovery, this anthology showcases established authors as well as up and coming talent.</p>
<p>All profits are to go to Asbury House. The support from this project will go to give Asbury House a home in Fort Collins, CO and give women the space to learn their strengths and build on them to recover.</p>
<p>""The mission of Asbury House is to provide a safe, holistic, and healthy physical environment where women are empowered to collaboratively develop their healing process keeping in mind their relationships with their families, communities, and environments, so that they are able to make more meaningful choices and achieve successful relationships, life goals, and economic productivity on their chosen paths.""</p>
<p>With your help, this project can bring hope and help to women who truly need it. We need your support today, and you'll get our book tomorrow. </p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;""> </span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</span></strong> </p>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Although Asbury house can use more than $5,000 to purchase their house, this will go a long way towards helping them reach their goal. By funding this anthology, all profits will go to the charity from sales of the book as well.  <strong>UPDATE:</strong> After more consideration, and more math involved, half of the money raised will have to go to printing, shipping and paying authors for the anthology and the rest of the money we raise will go straight to Asbury House. Further funds raised from the sale of the anthology through Amazon will go straight to the charity. </p>
</li>
<li>More details on Asbury house, their goals, and their mission can be found at <a href=""http://asburyhouse.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://asburyhouse.org/</a>

<p>$1 – For the love – Our gratitude             </p>
<p>$10 – For the ones and zeroes – A copy of the ebook</p>
<p>$15 – For the book – A trade paperback copy of the anthology</p>
<p>$25 – For the both – A copy of the ebook and a copy of the trade paperback</p>
<p>$50 – For the sign – A copy of the trade paperback with a handwritten thank you note from the editor.</p>
<p>$50 – For the acknowledgements – Included in the acknowledgements page of the book with our undying gratitude as well as a copy of the trade paperback or ebook, your choice. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Asbury House will offer their clients  world class treatment in a holistic, safe, and nurturing environment  where they will promote a sense of community, provide individual therapy, group therapy, competent assessment, 12-Step based education,  case management, sustainable nutritional health education and integrated fitness programs.</p>
<p>Their treatment program focuses on the whole person, including issues related to mind, body and spirit.  To accomplish this we utilize evidence based practice as well as accepted standards of alternative holistic healing approaches. We see our clients as partners in their recovery who are empowered to participate in the decision making process concerning their treatment. Each individual is unique and as a result we work with the client to determine their individualized treatment needs.  </p>
<p>Asbury House’s program is designed as extended care as an essential component of success to treat drug and alcohol addiction in addition to the underlying mental health and trauma issues that have contributed to substance abuse and or substance dependency in women. </p>
</li>
<li>With your contribution, you can help to make this a reality for women in a community that has no such program. Not only will you provide a safe, caring environment for women to develop their strengths and overcome the adversity of addiction and psychological issues, but also you will be providing a service that is badly needed in our community. </li>

<p>For published pieces we take First Print and/or Electronic Publishing Rights.

Recovery from addiction requires strength, and through strength can come recovery. But not all strengths are the same, nor are all addictions. Strength From Within aims to examine addiction and recovery through the lens of fantasy. With fifteen stories of bravery, strength and resilience in the face of addiction and recovery, this anthology showcases established authors as well as up and coming talent.
All profits are to go to Asbury House. The support from this project will go to give Asbury House a home in Fort Collins, CO and give women the space to learn their strengths and build on them to recover.
""The mission of Asbury House is to provide a safe, holistic, and healthy physical environment where women are empowered to collaboratively develop their healing process keeping in mind their relationships with their families, communities, and environments, so that they are able to make more meaningful choices and achieve successful relationships, life goals, and economic productivity on their chosen paths.""
With your help, this project can bring hope and help to women who truly need it. We need your support today, and you'll get our book tomorrow. 
 
What We Need & What You Get 




Although Asbury house can use more than $5,000 to purchase their house, this will go a long way towards helping them reach their goal. By funding this anthology, all profits will go to the charity from sales of the book as well.  UPDATE: After more consideration, and more math involved, half of the money raised will have to go to printing, shipping and paying authors for the anthology and the rest of the money we raise will go straight to Asbury House. Further funds raised from the sale of the anthology through Amazon will go straight to the charity. 

More details on Asbury house, their goals, and their mission can be found at http://asburyhouse.org/


$1 – For the love – Our gratitude             
$10 – For the ones and zeroes – A copy of the ebook
$15 – For the book – A trade paperback copy of the anthology
$25 – For the both – A copy of the ebook and a copy of the trade paperback
$50 – For the sign – A copy of the trade paperback with a handwritten thank you note from the editor.
$50 – For the acknowledgements – Included in the acknowledgements page of the book with our undying gratitude as well as a copy of the trade paperback or ebook, your choice. 
$100 – For the edits – Short story critique (Up to 5,000 words) from the editor. Plus a copy of the trade paperback. 
$1000 – For the win – Did we mention undying gratitude, let's talk undying everlasting gratitude. Oh, and all of the above stuff. 

If we don't reach our entire goal, the funds will go to Asbury House no matter what, however, the Anthology might not go through if I can't pay my authors and fund the printing and shipping costs. 

 


The Impact


Asbury House will offer their clients  world class treatment in a holistic, safe, and nurturing environment  where they will promote a sense of community, provide individual therapy, group therapy, competent assessment, 12-Step based education,  case management, sustainable nutritional health education and integrated fitness programs.
Their treatment program focuses on the whole person, including issues related to mind, body and spirit.  To accomplish this we utilize evidence based practice as well as accepted standards of alternative holistic healing approaches. We see our clients as partners in their recovery who are empowered to participate in the decision making process concerning their treatment. Each individual is unique and as a result we work with the client to determine their individualized treatment needs.  
Asbury House’s program is designed as extended care as an essential component of success to treat drug and alcohol addiction in addition to the underlying mental health and trauma issues that have contributed to substance abuse and or substance dependency in women. 

With your contribution, you can help to make this a reality for women in a community that has no such program. Not only will you provide a safe, caring environment for women to develop their strengths and overcome the adversity of addiction and psychological issues, but also you will be providing a service that is badly needed in our community.

<p>I hope you’ll hear me out.</p>
<p>I’ve recently been humbled by the opportunity to write the history of Newmarket (New Hampshire), a place I hold dear in my heart. A place I called home for over a decade. A place that graciously presented me with many of my life’s ups, and downs. Some of you know what I mean there. Some of you don’t. I’d be happy to tell you all about it sometime if you don’t know, and would like to learn more.</p>
<p>You’ve probably seen these town history books around. The publisher is Arcadia (<a href=""http://www.arcadiapublishing.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.arcadiapublishing.com</a>). They specialize in town histories, and the volumes they release are fueled by historic images. Images (and personal sentiment) are what drove me to take on this project. When I first moved to Newmarket I saw a photo of a massive ship set in the Lamprey River behind the old mill buildings in town (where I lived for a number of years with my family – the first roof that my one year-old son Willy J. called home as well…). I couldn’t fathom that a ship that size could sit in that river – a river my dog Red swam across just about every day when the weather was warm. That’s part of the history though; the industry that fueled Newmarket for many, many years. Upon seeing that photo, I wanted to learn more, and was immediately drawn to the undertaking of formally writing the town’s history in a volume that will be accented by the very photos that drew me in to begin with.</p>
<p><strong>So why am I firing up a crowd-sourced funding campaign?</strong></p>
<p>I’m going to be honest with you. This project isn’t about money for me. It’s about serving a community that has been very good to me over the years. When the book is released I'll be working author events for the town to help them raise money for the Historical Society.</p>
<p>I’m using this campaign as a pre-sale of the book. Basically, I have the opportunity to order copies of the book before it’s published to sell for myself. That opportunity, along with a (small) royalty is the only monetary means of compensation for the project. And I’m fine with that. I don’t expect to make any money off of this deal. I’d love for you to support me and purchase a copy in advance. It would mean the world to me. But, I wouldn’t be offended if you wanted to wait it out, and purchase it for a nickel off of Amazon a couple years from now. I understand.</p>
<p>Basically, the number of copies I order are the number of copies people purchase during the tenure of this campaign. The cover price of the book is $22. I’m going to start selling them at $20.</p>
<p>The due-date for the book is August. I'm assuming it will be published in the Fall (in time for the holiday season). I'll give the specific pub date when I receive it from Arcadia. But rest-assured, this is real. The contract is signed. Those that know me, know that I'm a man of my word.</p>
<p>Please, if you can afford it, grab one for the bookshelf, or to use as a coaster to keep your beverage upright, and your table dry. I know history books aren’t the most exciting things in the world, but the photos are at least cool to look at! It’ll be a conversation piece… And again, it would mean the world to me if you helped me out and supported this project, even if that means simply sharing this campaign with your friends.</p>
<p>Thanks for the consideration!</p>

<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<p>My name is Dragos Roua and, right now, I'm a digital nomad. For 10 years, I had an online publishing company, which I decided to sell in 2008. Since then. I focused on building myself, instead of building a business. Which proved to be ""slightly"" harder than building a business.</p>
<p>I traveled around the world, I experienced various lifestyles, from being raw vegan for 9 months, up to working continuously in coffee shops, and even creating and managing weekly events in them. I wrote 6 books, 2 of them being translated, printed and sold in Korea. I built a blog visited by hundreds of thousands of people each year. I wrote my own productivity framework and I also wrote an iOS app for it (without previous knowledge of Objective C whatsoever). I learned to tango. I started to run and I finished my first marathon. I ""tamed monkeys"".</p>
<p>Now, I want to put this experience into a book. Why? So others may learn from it. If so they choose, of course. Otherwise, they could simply enjoy the story.</p>
<p>It's the story of somebody who decided to live off the grid, but still to provide genuine value, while being constructively free.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What Do I Need And What Do You Get?</h3>
<p>What's in it for you? Simply put, the book. Your money will help me sustain my activities and current lifestyle, to edit it and to publish it. You will be part of something new, and, most likely, exciting. The smallest perk will also give you the finished book, in printed form.</p>
<p>The amount will be split as follows:</p>
<p>- $6000 sustaining my activities for 2 months, while focusing entirely on the book</p>
<p>- $4000 editing and publishing expenses</p>
<p>If I don't reach my goal, I will still publish the book, tryng to get alternative funding.</p>
<p>For $15, you get the book, period. Printed and shipped to your house.</p>
<p>For $50, you get 3 copies of the book, printed and shipped to your address, no strings attached.</p>
<p>For $1000 you will be listed on the back cover of the book as an official baker of this project, for as long as the book will stay in print.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Why Should I Support This Project?</h3>
Because you secretely long to know what this ""digital nomading"" buzz is about. And there's no better way to learn this than from someone who's already doing it.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Because you will help create a book that will give a new perspective to the world. I don't claim it will be necessarily better than the one you have right now, but it will be challenging for sure.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Because you will do a good thing. You will feel better about yourself.</div>
<div>
<h3>I Won't Donate, There's Something Else I Can Do?</h3>
Your attention, care and energy spent just by reading this will help. Seriously. I do believe in this kind of stuff.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>But if you can make some noise about this project, spread the word around, let others, potentially interested people, that this thing is going on, I will be even more grateful. Also, just using indiegogo sharing tools will make a big difference.</div>

I am a professional musician who lives in New Orleans. About 7 years ago, I viewed a video on YouTube which told a story about the plight of endangered elephants which moved me very deeply. The way in which these magnificent creatures are massacred for their ivory is atrocious. Back in the days of Ceasar there were millions of elephants roaming the earth. Today there are less than 1 million left. The elephants have been killed for centuries for their ivory which is mostly in demand in the Far East. This project is partly to reveal the plight of endangered elephants as well as tell a story of love and intrigue.</p>
<p>I have had this idea to write a fictional book based on true facts about the Ivory Trade. I plan to travel to research and observe the corrupt underworld of this cruel trade and its involvement based on greed and vanity for trinkets and trophy objects made of ivory. <br/></p>
<p>For the last 8 years I have been researching the plight of elephants..from elephants in captivity to their endangered plight in Africa and Asia.<br/></p>
<p>The story will feature an Asian American female heroine whose heart is captured by an elephant and her observations of the elephant's herd and how they are threatened by poachers. The heroine travels to China and a story unravels about the plight of the elephant versus the Ivory Trade. </p>
<p>This will be a fictional piece based on true facts regarding the Ivory Trade. A percentage of the proceeds of this book will be donated to reputable elephant preservation charities.</p>

I am a professional musician who lives in New Orleans. About 7 years ago, I viewed a video on YouTube which told a story about the plight of endangered elephants which moved me very deeply. The way in which these magnificent creatures are massacred for their ivory is atrocious. Back in the days of Ceasar there were millions of elephants roaming the earth. Today there are less than 1 million left. The elephants have been killed for centuries for their ivory which is mostly in demand in the Far East. This project is partly to reveal the plight of endangered elephants as well as tell a story of love and intrigue.

<p><strong>The Tiny Tale</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hello! My name is Chel O'Reilly. I am a fan of people and words and I like mixing them up. I write letters to friends, and friends have even go so far as to publish those letters themselves (which was awfully nice of 'em). Some samples of my letters are on the Optimists Write Love Letters website.</li>
<li>This campaign is for the sake of writing and publishing a book - a book of letters. </li>
<li>Your biggest contribution isn't just fiscal - it's inspirational. I can't write to the ether. I need to write to people. I want to write to you! The collection of letters to all of you IS the book.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Giveth and Receiveth</strong></p>
<p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>The funding raised in this campaign covers: the cost of writing the book, the perks and keeping the lights on while I do it. </li>
<li>There are some cool perks, including: posters, books, t-shirts, tickets to the launch party, a song... but every contributor gets my favorite part - a letter. You're not just part of the campaign, you will be part of the book itself.</li>
<li>This campaign is set up with a fixed goal - it's all or nothing my friends. That's my challenge, my dare. The goal is for the campaign to be finished by the end of January 2013 and the book to be finished &amp; printed by December 31st, 2013.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What Happens When...</strong></p>
<p>The project will result in US mail, email, a blog and a book. Whew!</p>
<p>The perks will include letters, posters, t-shirts, books... and if you're the one crazy amazing top tier donor, I have lots in store for you!  </p>
<ul>
<li>Here's The Optimists Write Love Letters Project in a few simple steps:</li>
<ul>
<li>I write you a letter. Don't worry, later, I'll email you a copy in case my handwriting isn't awesome. </li>
<li>I'll do a quick edit to a level of comfortable anonymity so your letter (sans name) can be shared on the Optimists Write Love Letters blog, and later, the book.</li>
<li>When your letter goes online, since I won't be publishing your name, I will create a hyperlink to your favorite charity. Why? Do we really need a reason to be nice?</li>
</ul>
<li>The ""drop date"" for when this whole thing begins is the day after the funding goal is reached - sometime in the next month. It will take several months to pen letters to so many people, so your patience is appreciated. I'll be writing consecutively of when each supporter signs up. Obviously, the book can't be published until the letters are done, so the best delivery date of that will be a few months down the line.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are SO many ways you can help. You could, for instance, be a big mouth!</p>
<p>Please make some noise on Twitter, FB, Tumblr, follow me, share me, see what's the latest news...</p>
