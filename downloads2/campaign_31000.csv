<h3><strong><span><span style=""color: orange;"">SHARP AS A TACK</span> IS <span style=""color: orange;"">PLAY WITH PURPOSE</span></span></strong></h3>
<p><strong>Kids learn best through Play. </strong>Better yet, kids are most engaged in their own learning experiences through Play. Through our student, educator and community programs, <a href=""http://www.sharp-as-a-tack.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Sharp As A Tack</strong></a> has become the leader in play-based learning.</p>
<p><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.sharp-as-a-tack.com/photos/kickpic4.png"" src="""" style=""""/> </strong></p>

<h3><strong><span style=""color: orange;"">WHY THE PLAY WITH PURPOSE NETWORK</span></strong></h3>
<p>Quite frankly, because we are being asked to and Sharp As A Tack is uniquely positioned to do so.</p>
<p>With <strong>The Play With Purpose Conference,</strong> we wanted to change the culture of professional development, to inspire teachers to use screen-free game play within their curriculum, to create a platform for curriculum development and to make these resources available to teachers throughout the country.</p>
<p>The response to that vision has been truly remarkable! We knew our attendees were going to have a great time and be thrilled receiving free games for their classrooms. From their feedback, however, it is having play-based learning resources available to them through collaboration with Sharp As A Tack and others across the country that has them most excited!</p>
<p>So the question became how do we build a collaborative network that will allow us to develop and deliver these resources to our attendees and others in an efficient, user-friendly, intuitive manner?</p>
<p>In search of a solution, we met with Facebook, Twitter, Google, Amazon, Edmodo, Yelp, Magento and others. However, we learned that a single tool does not yet exist that will allow us to accomplish what is being asked of us, so... we created our own solution - <strong>The Play With Purpose Network!</strong></p>

<p>migMobile – is a cross-platform framework that allows you to build fast and fluid native mobile applications in the language of your choice. We provide a common standardized API across the different platforms/operating systems. The application developed on one can be quickly and easily transferred to the others. In real world applications we have realized on average a 70% reduction in development time required to transfer to subsequent platforms.</p>
<p>This enables a developer to choose his favorite environment and develop the application using migMobile in the language that is most comfortable. The transfer of the application maintains all designs, views, layouts, controls, class structure and API calls to the new platform. The other language-specific logic can be transferred manually or by using the migMobile translator (currently in development).</p>
<p><strong>Funding Goals</strong></p>
<p>Version 1.0 of migMobile is a good beginning, it truly makes a substantial impact on the development time required to create full featured, fast and flowing native mobile applications... even on a single platform as was demonstrated in our video, and with an average of 70% savings when migrating an application across to other platforms.. it delivers great value... but we want to do so much more!</p>
<p>We want to expand the control suite, Develop IDE plug-ins to improve the migration process, create common project structures and import / export functions, expand our standardised API and features set, such as introducing common wait handles for synchronised multi threading and of course our big goal, work on improving the 70% platform migration savings to be 100% with our first step being the development of a code translation utility.</p>
<p>But, that is the future... what we want to do at this moment, is tell you more about what you will receive right now in version 1.0...</p>

<p><img alt=""How It Works"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://migonsoftware.com/images/migMobile/how_it_works.png"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""How It Works""/></p>
<h1>Features</h1>
<h2>Common cross-platform API</h2>
<p>migMobile is written in 3 languages: Objective-C (iOS) , Java (Android) and C# (Windows Phone). On every platform the framework provides the exact same API for developers. The only difference is language.</p>
<p>migMobile currently contains following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Media</li>
<li>Multithreading</li>
<li>Storage management</li>
<li>Social integration</li>
<li>UI</li>
<li>Application lifecycle</li>
<li>JSON and SOAP functions</li>
<li>Rich controls suite</li>
<li>Sensors</li>
<li>System integration</li>
<li>Navigation and app state management</li>
<li>Common types and definitions</li>
<li>Streams</li>
<li>Error handling</li>
<li>Animations</li>
</ul><p>We have provided additional details on a selection of these features below.</p>
<h2>Rich controls suite</h2>
<p>migMobile provides a great suite of UI controls. Here are some of them:</p>
<p><img alt=""Controls suite"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://migonsoftware.com/images/migMobile/controls_suite.png"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""Controls suite""/></p>
<p>The image above is only a sample. The full suite includes all commonly used controls and less common complex composite controls such as an interactive 2D menu. Our control suite includes 20 different controls and more will be included on a regular basis.</p>
<h2>Multi-threading support</h2>
<p>The framework is written in a way to fully support multi-threading. You can create, start and interact between threads to ensure that the UI remains responsive at all times.</p>
<h2>JSON &amp; SOAP tools</h2>
<p>Use the tools to automatically generate classes from WSDLs, which allows developers to interact with the web service in an object-oriented manner. We support SOAP as well as JSON services.</p>
<h2>Social integration</h2>
<p>Social is an increasingly important for mobile applications and our framework provides rich sharing support and integration with the common social networks, e.g. Facebook</p>
<h2>Storage API</h2>
<p>In modern feature rich applications it is very important that application data can be persisted on a mobile device. On different platforms storage mechanisms are achieved in different ways. Using migMobile allows a developer to access the various native storage APIs in a common and consistent way.</p>
<h2>Application lifecycle</h2>
<p>migMobile provides a series of event hooks relating to the application and views lifecycle such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>OnCreated</li>
<li>OnClosing</li>
<li>OnActivated</li>
<li>OnDeactivated</li>
<li>OnNavigatedTo</li>
<li>OnNavigatedFrom</li>
<li>OnNavigatingFrom</li>
<li>Etc.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<h2>Layout System</h2>
<p>migMobile provides a common and consistent layout system, for instance, relative panels.</p>
<p>In some cases relative positioning is interpreted differently on iOS and Android. However, when a developer uses migMobile, they know that when they position a control, it will be positioned correctly across all platforms.</p>
<h3>Relative panel usage example</h3>
<p>Every control placed on the relative panel has layout parameters. These specify the control’s alignment and margins.  On the images bellow you can see examples of relative layout:</p>
<p><img alt=""Layout panels"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://migonsoftware.com/images/migMobile/layout.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Layout panels""/></p>

<h1>The Team</h1>
<p>We are a Swiss based software development company that specializes in web and mobile applications. We have been involved in the development of many complex and critical systems. Spanning many years of experience working in Ireland, United Kingdom and Switzerland in some of the largest corporations including Citigroup, UBS and British Telecom. </p>
<p>We currently have 9 developers working on various web and mobile projects for a variety of blue chip clients.</p>
<p>Our experience in developing applications for a wide range of purposes, for many different clients has taught us that many of the existing products on the market today are becoming inefficient, both in runtime performance and an ever increasing development lifecycle.</p>
<p>migMobile is an example of a product designed to address these performance and complexity issues. It has been in development for 12 months and includes lessons learnt in real world scenarios. V 1.0 of the product that is available and ready today is a result of an optimization process that we began when required to provide multiple versions of a single application for the different platforms. migMobile has demonstrated its ability to provide real and tangible benefits in the creation of mobile applications for our clients and now we want to share these benefits with you.</p>
<p>Migon is an acronym for “Make It GO Now”. This is very much our philosophy and this is reflected in migMobile.</p>
<h1>Timelines and what your pledges will go towards</h1>
<p>migMobile v 1.0 is ready and available now. This development has already been completed. Any backer that has pledged for a license for our software will receive this software within 14 days of this funding pitch being completed.</p>
<p>Any funds generated will go towards the development of future versions and new functionality, with our main goal being the creation of a code translator.</p>
<p>Version 2.0 wish list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extend multithreading support (implement wait handles, etc.).</li>
<li>Extend social integration API to include additional such as LinkedIn.</li>
<li>Initial graphics API for 3D support.</li>
<li>Extend the control suite including states support and other RAD enhancements.</li>
<li>Add Windows 8 (RT, x86) and BlackBerry (v. 10) support (Windows Phone 8 is already supported in version 1.0).</li>

We are a Swiss based software development company that specializes in web and mobile applications. We have been involved in the development of many complex and critical systems. Spanning many years of experience working in Ireland, United Kingdom and Switzerland in some of the largest corporations including Citigroup, UBS and British Telecom. 
We currently have 9 developers working on various web and mobile projects for a variety of blue chip clients.
Our experience in developing applications for a wide range of purposes, for many different clients has taught us that many of the existing products on the market today are becoming inefficient, both in runtime performance and an ever increasing development lifecycle.
migMobile is an example of a product designed to address these performance and complexity issues. It has been in development for 12 months and includes lessons learnt in real world scenarios. V 1.0 of the product that is available and ready today is a result of an optimization process that we began when required to provide multiple versions of a single application for the different platforms. migMobile has demonstrated its ability to provide real and tangible benefits in the creation of mobile applications for our clients and now we want to share these benefits with you.
Migon is an acronym for “Make It GO Now”. This is very much our philosophy and this is reflected in migMobile.
Timelines and what your pledges will go towards
migMobile v 1.0 is ready and available now. This development has already been completed. Any backer that has pledged for a license for our software will receive this software within 14 days of this funding pitch being completed.
Any funds generated will go towards the development of future versions and new functionality, with our main goal being the creation of a code translator.
Version 2.0 wish list:

Extend multithreading support (implement wait handles, etc.).
Extend social integration API to include additional such as LinkedIn.
Initial graphics API for 3D support.
Extend the control suite including states support and other RAD enhancements.
Add Windows 8 (RT, x86) and BlackBerry (v. 10) support (Windows Phone 8 is already supported in version 1.0).",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>Torservers.net</h2>
<p>Torservers.net was started in 2011 in Germany, and quickly became the largest contributor of exit bandwidth for the Tor network. Today, Torservers.net is a collaborative effort by six+ registered non-profits around the globe (see below for a list of organizations). With selected datacenter partners, we professionally operate Tor infrastructure that strengthens the anonymity and speeds up Tor for everyone.</p>
<p>Together, we currently contribute <strong>around 10 Gbit/s</strong>, a massive amount of traffic: Over 3000 terabytes of user traffic are moved per month.</p>
<p>All of us volunteer to maintain the infrastructure. Your donations will be used in full to pay for traffic and servers.</p>
<p><strong>What we will use your donations for:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>run more Tor servers, maintain current ones, increase its speed!</li>
</ul><p>Usability studies conclude that the most common reason to pick an inferiour and potentially unsafe anti-censorship tool is the slow speed of the Tor network. We believe it is crucial to add both a large number of Tor bridges, and a certain number of fast exit relays, as both bridges and exits currently present the bottleneck of the Tor network.</p>
<p>Bridge Operation: To be able to access the Tor network and thus the free Internet, users in oppressive countries that filter standard Tor access need to learn about special Tor relays as entry points, so called Tor bridges. These are not published as a whole, but distributed in small batches via various means (email, web, social networks, etc). Once the censor learns about the specific bridge, the user needs a new one. Blocked bridges can still be useful in other censoring countries, and so far most countries lifted the block after some period of time (most likely to avoid having too large filter rule tables).</p>
<p>Exit Operation: We will equally coordinate operation of high bandwidth Tor exit relays with a different subset of our partners.</p>
<p><strong>How do we distribute the money?</strong><strong style=""font-size: 10px;""> </strong></p>
<p>Each of our partners will get an equal share of the money. Organizations can decide to give parts of their own share to others within the Torservers network. Expenses will be published for public review (hosting bills).</p>
<p><strong>Will the campaign continue after you hit the 1000€ funding goal?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. The campaign will run the full 60 days, and we really hope to collect more than the low barrier of 1000 Euro. To give you an idea, a dedicated Gbit/s server costs at least 400 Euro in Germany, 1000 Euro in Denmark, and 8000 Euro in Asia -- per month. To stengthen the anonymity of Tor users, the servers ideally are distributed all around the globe. Currently, there's a 30 percent chance that a Tor user exits in the USA, and around 25 percent of entering the Tor network via a server in Germany. We aim to change that, and not put more servers into these two jurisdictions.</p>

Additionally to building the roof, we are naturally aiming at also contributing a small startup packkage of computers to see to it the kids can get to work wright after the roof has been completed, for this an additional 3000  euromaking the total 8000 euro we ask here would be a welcome donation.</p>

Isaack had a fantastic year at St. Andrew's College. He played soccer in the fall and ran track and field in the spring and finished the year by winning the Colonel Tiltson award, 'a courage under fire award' for the student who was deemed by their teachers to have put in the most effort into education and other school activities. We would have liked for Isaack to have stayed at SAC and they did offer a larger scholarship for him to enter grade 10, but his Canadian visa was unfortunately not renewed when we made the application (and to complicate matters the visa workers have been on strike for almost a year). Because of the Canadian immigration rules and to not impact on Isaack's ability to reapply and return to Canada at a later date we had him return to Tanzania in September 2013. After Isaack's return to Tanzania, we started to look for good educational opportunities for him there so he can complete high school. Thankfully a boarding school in Arusha has taken an interest in him largely due to strong references from previous teachers. Isaack has been offered a spot at St. Constantine's School where they take several orphan students per year, who, like Isaack, have good potential and great personalities but would not have the opportunity to go to private school in Tanzania. The school has also realized Isaack's potential for sports leadership and he will take on a role as assistant to the Director of the sports programs at the school when he is not in the classroom. We are so grateful that St. Constantine's is giving Isaack this chance. They are providing Isaack with some support towards his tuition and they have asked us to raise $5000 towards living expenses, school uniform and health fees. Our goal is to raise a bit more because Indiegogo keeps 4% and if we raise over our target it will go towards school fees for next year.<br/><br/>Hence, we are reaching out to you again to ask for support for Isaack in his new school. We thank all of you from the bottom of our hearts for supporting Isaack last year in what proved to be an extremely educational and fulfilling year for him at St. Andrew's. It is our goal to keep Isaack supported so that he can complete his secondary school education in Tanzania over the next two years. We know he will make all of us proud no matter what challenges he faces. We will be updating Isaack's Soccer Dream fundraising campaign on Indiegogo over the next few days and we hope that, if you are able, you or your family members will be able to contribute something (however small) towards Isaack's education.</h3><p><br/></p></div>","Dear friends, family and Isaack supporters,We would like to thank everyone again for the wonderful support we received last year towards Isaack's education at St. Andrew's College. We felt it was time to update everyone on Isaack's journey over the last year. Isaack had a fantastic year at St. Andrew's College. He played soccer in the fall and ran track and field in the spring and finished the year by winning the Colonel Tiltson award, 'a courage under fire award' for the student who was deemed by their teachers to have put in the most effort into education and other school activities. We would have liked for Isaack to have stayed at SAC and they did offer a larger scholarship for him to enter grade 10, but his Canadian visa was unfortunately not renewed when we made the application (and to complicate matters the visa workers have been on strike for almost a year). Because of the Canadian immigration rules and to not impact on Isaack's ability to reapply and return to Canada at a later date we had him return to Tanzania in September 2013. After Isaack's return to Tanzania, we started to look for good educational opportunities for him there so he can complete high school. Thankfully a boarding school in Arusha has taken an interest in him largely due to strong references from previous teachers. Isaack has been offered a spot at St. Constantine's School where they take several orphan students per year, who, like Isaack, have good potential and great personalities but would not have the opportunity to go to private school in Tanzania. The school has also realized Isaack's potential for sports leadership and he will take on a role as assistant to the Director of the sports programs at the school when he is not in the classroom. We are so grateful that St. Constantine's is giving Isaack this chance. They are providing Isaack with some support towards his tuition and they have asked us to raise $5000 towards living expenses, school uniform and health fees. Our goal is to raise a bit more because Indiegogo keeps 4% and if we raise over our target it will go towards school fees for next year.Hence, we are reaching out to you again to ask for support for Isaack in his new school. We thank all of you from the bottom of our hearts for supporting Isaack last year in what proved to be an extremely educational and fulfilling year for him at St. Andrew's. It is our goal to keep Isaack supported so that he can complete his secondary school education in Tanzania over the next two years. We know he will make all of us proud no matter what challenges he faces. We will be updating Isaack's Soccer Dream fundraising campaign on Indiegogo over the next few days and we hope that, if you are able, you or your family members will be able to contribute something (however small) towards Isaack's education.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>We want every girl and woman in Cameroon to be informed of the dangers of breast ironing by the end of 2013. </p>
<p>This project began in May 2012 and has reached about 10.000 women in the North West Region of Cameroon who have been sensitized about the dangers of breast ironing and the need to give their children sex education. We want to be able to extend it to the other 9 regions of the country and also include screening and treatment of breast related diseases.</p>
<p>With your support we will expand our success and equip women leaders in Cameroon to become sensitizers and train thousands of women to commit to end the practice in their homes and communities.</p>
<p>Many victims of breast ironing regret they were born girls. Their self-esteem and that natural pride of womahood have been destroyed. By contributing to this cause, you are restoring an invaluable teasure in that little girl.You will be teaching her how to rejoice at the birth of a girl child.Above all, you will be helping to preserve the health and spirits of generations of girls to come.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>This sum will help:</strong></p>
<p>-Transport sensitizers to remote areas</p>
<p>-Organize training sessions</p>
<p>-Pay for media campaigns,</p>
<p>-Produce and distribute flyers and campaign kits in schools and other community  centers,</p>

<p> </p></div>","We want every girl and woman in Cameroon to be informed of the dangers of breast ironing by the end of 2013. 
This project began in May 2012 and has reached about 10.000 women in the North West Region of Cameroon who have been sensitized about the dangers of breast ironing and the need to give their children sex education. We want to be able to extend it to the other 9 regions of the country and also include screening and treatment of breast related diseases.
With your support we will expand our success and equip women leaders in Cameroon to become sensitizers and train thousands of women to commit to end the practice in their homes and communities.
Many victims of breast ironing regret they were born girls. Their self-esteem and that natural pride of womahood have been destroyed. By contributing to this cause, you are restoring an invaluable teasure in that little girl.You will be teaching her how to rejoice at the birth of a girl child.Above all, you will be helping to preserve the health and spirits of generations of girls to come.


This sum will help:
-Transport sensitizers to remote areas
-Organize training sessions
-Pay for media campaigns,
-Produce and distribute flyers and campaign kits in schools and other community  centers,
- Support the treatment of victims with breast related diseases
-Provide T-shirts,banners and snacks for participants of our nationwide breast ironing awareness march in Februrary,March, July and November 2013.

and those with Autism, Asperger’s and other Pervasive Developmental Delays; and
youth, ages 14-21, living in foster care, group homes or involved in the
justice system, with social and emotional challenges. </p>
<p><b>Our Programs: </b>HHK offers three core learning
experiences Group Groundwork Lessons, Individual Mounted Lessons and Vocational
Training. Each of these activities helps clients gain confidence in their

sense of control over their emotions, a better understanding how they communicate
and a lasting connection to another being - the horse.</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><p><i>Group Groundwork Lessons</i> conducted in partnership with
schools and community organizations, introduce special needs individuals to the
language of the horse and emphasize the acquisition of life skills. HHK
uses horses as instructional partners to build self-confidence, develop
independence, encourage responsibility, teach consequences, illustrate
cause-and-effect relationships, develop social skills, and recognize non-verbal
communication and cues. These essential life skills assist students to navigate
the challenges they face in social situations. </p></li>
<li><p><i>Individual Mounted Lessons</i> are designed for children with
developmental delays and are tailored to the individual needs of each client. HHK
utilizes the horse as a tool to help children and youth overcome motor, visual,
sensory and anxiety challenges. A typical lesson includes stretching and games
to encourage strength, coordination and mobility. Clients also navigate in
different patterns throughout the arena. All of these activities encourage
active listening and following directions. Children with communication
difficulties are encouraged to use words to tell the horse what to do. Following
lessons, parents and volunteers have observed numerous instances of improved
communication, coordination, balance and expansion of emotional expression.</p></li>
<li><p><i>Vocational Training</i> offers at-risk youth the
opportunity to acquire valuable vocational and professional skills through
participation in four weeks of hands-on training led by Hope, Horses and Kids

program also includes eight weeks of paid-internships at the business-partner
of their choice.

In March I hope to attend a permaculture teacher training called <i>Designing Educational Ecosystems</i>, which provides participants with tools to better lead and assist permaculture workshops and design certifications. Then, from the knowledge and momentum gained in this training, I will teach a series of accessible, affordable introductory permaculture courses in my area this summer. These workshops will be an excellent opportunity to reach a wider audience and strengthen our community of change-makers, while providing me with invaluable hands-on teaching experience.</p><p>So, this is where you come in! <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">By contributing to my campaign, you will not only help fund my attendance at this training, but will also enable me to further propagate permaculture in my community.

For many it consists of ""meeting human needs while enhancing ecosystem health."" Some would opt for the more specific: ""a design of human settlements that are based on ecological principles and practices that restore and renew natural systems."" And still others could sum up permaculture as ""the practice of common sense."" Despite the vast and various ways of describing permaculture, most would likely agree that permaculture essentially serves to promote healthy, regenerative growth of our earth, its people, and the balance between them.</span></span><p></p><p></p><h4><span>Why?</span></h4><span><span>You may not call what you do “permaculture” – it may be green building or sustainable agriculture or non-violent communication or one of the countless other labels attributed to the things we do and believe. What’s important isn't the labels, but the unity that can be found in similar goals and visions. Despite the many grim and often uncertain issues of our current time - global climate change, species extinction, social isolation, etc. - every individual does what they can in their own way to address these realities. Permaculture envisions a world designed for resiliency, where multi-generational communities thrive and cooperation is a premium; where agency to grow food is given back to the people so they can feel empowered and sustained; and where inner human landscapes and outer ecological landscapes can reflect one another in health and harmony. Permaculture – and anything that promotes a similar vision – is needed now in order to start repairing and regenerating our planet and our lives.</span></span><p></p><p></p><h4><span>How?</span></h4><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Permaculture ethics, principles, and practices are beginning to gain a foothold in many places throughout the world, yet remain inaccessible for most. Costs of running a Permaculture Design Course (PDC) – an internationally recognized certification – are often high, which inflates the cost for the students. Many students may also have difficulty committing the 72+ hours required for a full PDC, which is typically organized in a multi-week intensive format.<br/><br/>This summer I will be teaching a series of smaller permaculture workshops, which will offer cost-effective access to the basics while still providing participants with pragmatic know-how to begin their permaculture journey. Depending on the funding tier, these workshops can also be held in a space of the participant's choosing, thereby producing tangible, place-based results and next steps. </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">By attending the </span><i style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Designing Educational Ecosystems </i><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">training, I will “develop the complete suite of skills needed to begin successfully leading [these] short permaculture workshops and other events on [my] own,” which is why I am asking for your support in proactively funding this workshop series.</span><p><br/></p><p></p><h2>Awesome Swag.</h2><p>All swag was produced by yours truly, with the exception of the poem ""My Haiti Dream,"" which was written by my good friend <a href=""http://permacultureseries.wordpress.com/teaching-team/organizing-team/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jean Arnaud</a>.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<ul><li>My name is Jared Gaines. I work as a youth minister at Stoney Point Church of Christ in Deatsville, AL. My wife Lena is a nurse at one of our hospitals in Montgomery, AL. Recently we have had it on our hearts to take a mission trip to Tanzania, Africa, in hopes of evangelizing to the people there. I went for the first time last year during December to do a children's camp with BackWoods Christian Camp. This year my wife is wanting to go and we ourselves are going to head a missions team to Tanzania. While we are over there we plan on doing campaign work for the church there which includes Bible studies, medical work, VBS for the children in the area of Arusha, and work with the local orphanage.  This campaign holds a special place in our hearts because my family has done mission work in Africa since before I was born. I have always dreamed of one day doing long term work and would appreciate your help in making part of this step come true. We have been praying for a long time for the support to make this dream a reality and you could be a part of our dream and bring a little bit of hope to Africa as well. <br/>
</li></ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>We need about $7,500 for our airfare , food, lodging, and supplies for the VBS we plan on putting on for the children in Arusha. The extra funds we made as the goal was to help out others that are going in our group as well.

We know that not everyone can go physically, but we are asking you to come with us in spirit and embark on a journey to change lives. We will soon be creating a blog and will let you all know when that is up and running. Thank you again for your donations, prayers, and support of our mission work. <br/><p></p>

My name is Jared Gaines. I work as a youth minister at Stoney Point Church of Christ in Deatsville, AL. My wife Lena is a nurse at one of our hospitals in Montgomery, AL. Recently we have had it on our hearts to take a mission trip to Tanzania, Africa, in hopes of evangelizing to the people there. I went for the first time last year during December to do a children's camp with BackWoods Christian Camp. This year my wife is wanting to go and we ourselves are going to head a missions team to Tanzania. While we are over there we plan on doing campaign work for the church there which includes Bible studies, medical work, VBS for the children in the area of Arusha, and work with the local orphanage.  This campaign holds a special place in our hearts because my family has done mission work in Africa since before I was born. I have always dreamed of one day doing long term work and would appreciate your help in making part of this step come true. We have been praying for a long time for the support to make this dream a reality and you could be a part of our dream and bring a little bit of hope to Africa as well. 



What We Need & What You GetWe need about $7,500 for our airfare , food, lodging, and supplies for the VBS we plan on putting on for the children in Arusha. The extra funds we made as the goal was to help out others that are going in our group as well. We have several of our youth that are planning on taking this trip for the first time.  We know that this is a lot to ask for but everyone who contributes to our cause will be helping us share God's love to those who may not yet know it. We believe that those in tough situations are the ones who need God the most. Most of the African population is looking for something to hope in, something to cling on, and a little bit of love as well. By helping support us you will be giving children one the memories my wife and I cherish most, Vacation Bible School. We will be assisting the locals with different tasks they may need, my wife hopes to help out in the clinic, and we will be immersing ourselves in the African culture.

<h2 dir=""ltr"">My name is Cesar Martinez, and I want you to join me in cultivating the leaders we’ve been waiting for: The Young Veterans. Before explaining how we plan to achieve this, I want to answer what most of you are probably  wondering:</h2>
<h2 dir=""ltr""><strong style=""font-size: 1.5em;"">“What is a Young Veteran?”</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Young Veteran: A person who, despite having lived for a relatively short time, presents as incomparably wise and long experienced in life’s challenges. Classification as a Young Veteran necessitates that one embodies three things:</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">1. A personal commitment to increasing <strong>intelligence</strong>, broadly defined, insofar as it may be used to serve;</p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-left: 30px;""><span>2. A deeply rooted <strong>integrity</strong> that spans the foundations of any individual character traits or skill sets; And</span></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">3. An innate <strong>initiative</strong> that, in cooperation with one’s intelligence and integrity, shapes personal abilities into tangible and transformative outcomes.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""> </p>
<h2 dir=""ltr""><span>I. Executive Summary</span></h2>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>This campaign is to launch the inaugural Young Veterans Summer Program - an innovative four-week residential program that aims to cultivate every student-athlete into a socially responsible, civically engaged, well-versed leader who can utilize their unique skills to enhance their communities and create success in a field of their choice. This intensive athletic, personal, and professional development program tailored to under-resourced student-athletes in high school and junior college weaves together 6 major elements*:</span></p>
<ol>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Intensive, personalized athletic development and training</strong></p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Daily community outreach and service engagements</strong></p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Hands-on workshops with esteemed professionals in a diversity of fields</strong></p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Academic engagements that will support a healthy student-athlete experience</strong></p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>New and challenging opportunities for personal and social advancement, and</strong></p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>A residential program designed to foster open conversations, mutual respect, and personal discipline. </strong></p>
</li>
</ol><p> </p>
<p>*To read more about each of the aforementioned program components, visit the section entitled “The Program”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2 dir=""ltr""><span>II. The Ask: $17K</span></h2>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>At a bare minimum, we will need $17K to launch Young Veterans. However, in order to operate the program as it is intended, we will need $33K. Here is a breakdown of how we plan to use the base $17K that we need:</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>18% <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Organizational Operations</span></strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-left: 30px;""><span>This portion of our budget will cover organizational expenses integral to operating the Summer Program well. Line items include: our Young Vets Website, photo/video coverage of the program, and a few small items like thank you notes and business cards.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>34% <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Program Operations</span></strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-left: 30px;""><span>Under program operations, budget items fall into 3 main categories:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style=""""><ol>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Athletic Operations (gym access, training equipment, first-aid kit etc.), </span></p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Team Gear (uniforms for Young Vets and a Young Vets polo for business-casual engagements), and</span></p>
</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Transportation costs (monthly van rental and gas for college tours, community service, team hikes, games, and workshops)</span></p>
</li>
</ol></li>
</ol><p dir=""ltr""><strong>48% <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Food &amp; Living Costs</span></strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-left: 30px;""><span>Feeding 8 athletes in training will be expensive. (Food costs alone represent 45% of our total $17K budget!) All of our athletes will be eating fresh, nutritionally packed foods that we prepare for and, many times, in conjunction with our program participants. Hence, this budget subsection’s line items consist of large volumes of fresh foods that are not inflated by costs associated with eating out. </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-left: 30px;""><span>Apart from food, the remainder of this budget subsection includes a modest budget for living expenses while the Young Vets are hosted locally free of charge (i.e. miscellaneous household items like cleaning supplies and a subsidy for projected increases in electricity costs).</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>0% <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Staffing Costs</span></strong></p>

<h2 dir=""ltr"">IV. The Program</h2>
<p>From June 17 - July 15, 2013, eight uniquely talented, hard working, and motivated young men that have demonstrated the raw passion and unbridled desire necessary to think, do, and be better will attend The Young Veterans Summer Program.  If you want to learn more about this bi-coastal group of ballers, visit the “Meet the Vets” section (Coming Soon!) below. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Intensive, personalized athletic development and training</strong></h3>
<p>For roughly 5 hours on a daily basis, participants engage in intensive athletic trainings tailored to their developmental stage, needs, and goals. Specifically, they will receive:</p>
<p><em>Initial consultation and personalized training plan</em> to gather baseline data and inform each Young Vet’s individual goals.</p>
<p><em>Basketball Skills and Development</em> to give them an X-factor on the court that will match the intensity and quality of their character. During these two-a-day sessions, our Player Development coaching staff will be giving participants the real-time feedback and mentorship necessary to elevate their game.</p>
<p><em>Personalized Strength Training</em> designed to bring each participant to his optimal physical capacity.</p>
<p><em>Speed &amp; Agility Training</em> based on game-like functional movements to enhance results.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Daily community outreach and service engagements</strong></h3>
<p>We believe that genuine character and true leadership are closely tied to one’s practiced ability to give without expectation of receiving. To this ends, each Young Vet works with different individuals and organizations in the community every day to do anything that bestows a net positive value. Whether in the form of independently cleaning up a local park, volunteering at a local nonprofit, or helping out a neighbor, we want the Young Veterans to walk away with a set of eyes trained to see endless opportunities to serve.</p>
<p><strong>           </strong></p>
<h3><strong>Hands-on workshops with esteemed professionals in a diversity of fields</strong></h3>
<p>Twice a week, the Young Vets will spend 5 hours learning and practicing a variety of highly useful things in workshops facilitated by different “Successful Athletes”: a class of people that we define as engaged citizens and professionals who, after extracting key skill sets and character traits from athletic participation at some level, have subsequently applied them to advancement in any realm. A full list of workshops and our incredible Successful Athletes volunteering for this summer’s program will be highlighted on our website in coming weeks, but check out a sneak peak of a few of the topics in the meantime:</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em>Know Your Rights: Understanding the Law</em></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em>Injury Prevention and Rehabilitation in Sports</em></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em>Nutrition for Performance and Life</em></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em>Personal Finance: Investing in your Future</em></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>Academic engagements that will support a healthy student-athlete experience</strong></h3>
<p>Learning how to balance academic and athletic demands are central to having a positive student-athlete experience at any level. With that in mind, a central part of our summer program is the Weekly College Tour. Over the course of the program, the Young Vets will receive a semi-customized tour of 4 different college campuses in the Bay Area. Each tour will be designed to give them real insight into the requirements, opportunities, challenges, and strategies for success unique to the experience of a collegiate student-athlete.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>New and challenging opportunities for personal and social advancement</strong></h3>
<p>Every Friday, the Young Vets will journey beyond the bounds of everyday life for an extended outdoor excursion meant to test their limits and provide the space and time for personal reflection. Currently, we are planning to hike some of the Bay’s myriad of stunningly beautiful natural preserves and mountain ranges. The Young Vets will spend a subset of these adventures engaged in facilitated discussions and independent personal reflection. We believe that, paired with intensive athletic training and equally engaging workshops and community service opportunities, devoting time and energy to outdoor exploration is a necessary outlet to properly synthesize one’s many thoughts and feelings about this period of intensive growth.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>A residential program designed to foster open conversations, mutual respect, and personal discipline.</strong></h3>
<p>Underlying every part of the Young Vets program is the backbone of the residential experience. The place where the Young Vets are being housed is more than just a place to rest their heads at night. We have intentionally designed the residential experience to be a learning experience in:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Nutrition</em></p>
<p>We will be using the residential setting to teach them how to select nutritional foods and actually prepare them because we believe that this is an important life skill for each individual participant to leave the program with.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Chores</em></p>
<p>Everyone living in the house will have a set of chores to complete on a set schedule. We aim to instill a strong sense of personal discipline and social responsibility in each Young Vet by having them complete even the smallest of chores with personal pride.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Cooperative Living</em></p>
<p>Sharing a living space can be hard, but we want to promote the value in adopting a lifelong mindset of cooperative living. As such, all ground rules are focused on being true to oneself while also being kind, respectful, and courteous of the time, space, and personal belongings of others.</p>
<p> </p></div>","My name is Cesar Martinez, and I want you to join me in cultivating the leaders we’ve been waiting for: The Young Veterans. Before explaining how we plan to achieve this, I want to answer what most of you are probably  wondering:
“What is a Young Veteran?”
 
Young Veteran: A person who, despite having lived for a relatively short time, presents as incomparably wise and long experienced in life’s challenges. Classification as a Young Veteran necessitates that one embodies three things:
1. A personal commitment to increasing intelligence, broadly defined, insofar as it may be used to serve;
2. A deeply rooted integrity that spans the foundations of any individual character traits or skill sets; And
3. An innate initiative that, in cooperation with one’s intelligence and integrity, shapes personal abilities into tangible and transformative outcomes.
 
I. Executive Summary
This campaign is to launch the inaugural Young Veterans Summer Program - an innovative four-week residential program that aims to cultivate every student-athlete into a socially responsible, civically engaged, well-versed leader who can utilize their unique skills to enhance their communities and create success in a field of their choice. This intensive athletic, personal, and professional development program tailored to under-resourced student-athletes in high school and junior college weaves together 6 major elements*:


Intensive, personalized athletic development and training


Daily community outreach and service engagements


Hands-on workshops with esteemed professionals in a diversity of fields


Academic engagements that will support a healthy student-athlete experience


New and challenging opportunities for personal and social advancement, and


A residential program designed to foster open conversations, mutual respect, and personal discipline.

II. The Ask: $17K
At a bare minimum, we will need $17K to launch Young Veterans. However, in order to operate the program as it is intended, we will need $33K. Here is a breakdown of how we plan to use the base $17K that we need:
18% Organizational Operations
This portion of our budget will cover organizational expenses integral to operating the Summer Program well. Line items include: our Young Vets Website, photo/video coverage of the program, and a few small items like thank you notes and business cards.
34% Program Operations
Under program operations, budget items fall into 3 main categories:



Athletic Operations (gym access, training equipment, first-aid kit etc.), 


Team Gear (uniforms for Young Vets and a Young Vets polo for business-casual engagements), and


Transportation costs (monthly van rental and gas for college tours, community service, team hikes, games, and workshops)


48% Food & Living Costs
Feeding 8 athletes in training will be expensive. (Food costs alone represent 45% of our total $17K budget!) All of our athletes will be eating fresh, nutritionally packed foods that we prepare for and, many times, in conjunction with our program participants. Hence, this budget subsection’s line items consist of large volumes of fresh foods that are not inflated by costs associated with eating out. 
Apart from food, the remainder of this budget subsection includes a modest budget for living expenses while the Young Vets are hosted locally free of charge (i.e. miscellaneous household items like cleaning supplies and a subsidy for projected increases in electricity costs).
0% Staffing Costs
Yes, you’re reading that correctly: we are not asking for any staffing costs as a part of this bare-bones budget. All of our program and summer staff have agreed to volunteer their time to see Young Vets happen. Even if we raise the full $33K, only $4K (12% of the total budget) will be paid to our dedicated staff. 
 
 
III. Other Ways You Can Help
It will require immense efforts to bring the Young Veterans Summer Program to fruition. Your monetary contributions are greatly appreciated and will help move us in the right direction. Although we are asking for your financial support via this indieGoGo campaign, we are actively seeking other contributions that may aid us in our efforts to provide a life-changing summer experience to these enthusiastic young men. Although we always invite any ideas and enthusiasm that can add value to our program, here are some specific areas of need:
Housing
Although there is arranged housing available, we are still on the hunt for one centralized place better suited for the Young Veterans to interact and develop together. If you have a house in the Bay Area and would be open to donating use of it to the program or know of a good lead to finding dorm-style housing, please reach out!
Equipment
The depth and intensity of training in the Young Veterans Summer Program requires a great deal of  unique equipment. Although we have a small budget to procure some of these items, donating and/or lending any of the following would be a great help to the program:
Training equipment includes but is not limited to:


Speed ladders 


Resistance Bands 


Heavy Basketballs


Standard Basketballs 


Cones 


Hurdles 

 
Community Service

<h3>A Little History</h3>
<p>In September 2011, I went to Thailand on a Fulbright English Teaching Assistantship grant.  Through my placement at Maehorphra Wittayakom School in Chiang Mai, I met and got to know a talented student named Suttipon.</p>
<p>Suttipon is an exceptional young woman, devoted to learning and to helping her family.  She is bright, funny, and more than capable of achieveing her goals given an opportunity.</p>
<p>Suttipon grew up in a small, isolated Karen village in Mae Chaem, Chiang Mai.  As poor, ethnic minorities, Suttipon and the other families in her village lack the opportunity to receive their own education.  Those who can afford must travel down from the mountains to the Thai government schools in order to access any kind of formal education.</p>
<p>Suttipon identifies as a ""White Karen.""  It is an ethnicity within the large, heterogenous grouping of the Karen people, a people who primarily live in the mountains of southeastern Myanmar and northern Thailand.  The Karen people have historically practiced swidden agriculture and lived as subsistent farmers, while being relatively autonomous from the low land cultures of both the Bamars and the Thais.</p>
<p>The Karen people have little economic, political, or social power now to access institutional education.  As such, many families lack the opportunity and capability to pursue formal education.  </p>
<h3><strong>The Scholarship and Your Support</strong></h3>
<p>For the past several years, Suttipon and a group of other children from her home village of Mae Ju Sam have lived near and attended a government school together through the support of a Dutch organization called Hill Tribes Children.  However, when Suttipon graduates from high school next year, Hill Tribes Children will no longer be able to fully support her as she tries to attend university and become a teacher.  I hope to raise enough funds to fill the financial gaps and give Suttipon an opportunity to pursue her dream of becoming a teacher.</p>
<p>With your support, we can not only help a deserving young individual become the first woman from her family to graduate from university, but also assist her in living a dignified, happy life.  By achieving her goal of becoming a teacher, Suttipon will also help other rural, poor children from the mountains learn and grow, assist in community development, and allow her family to live a better life.</p>
<p>Suttipon will need $5,000 US dollars to continue her education through university for the next four years.  All of the money raised will go directly towards her tuition cost.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>If you choose to support, you can receive letters and pictures from Suttipon, and traditional, handmade Karen bags and other crafts.  Any and all support is greatly appreciated!  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I am committed to supporting Suttipon because I know the kind of person she is and what she is capable of.  I sincerely believe that any kind of development and sustainability begins with the education of women.  Your support will go a long way towards helping poor, marginalizd women overcome inequality and hardship.  A teaching scholarship for Suttipon will benefit herself, her family, and the mountaneous children and communities of northern Thailand.</p>

The idea behind our school is that children want to learn, and can do so best in a cooperative multi-age environment, with little stress, more attention from a teacher, and where inquiry-based learning is determined by a child's developmental readiness; the idea is that an initial nurturing educational environment fosters the development of a genuine, life-long passion for learning.

<p>Hello I am Natasha Huntington and I am trying to raise money so I can go to Center for Sacred Studies. It is an online school for Ministerial Training. The study includes ""opportunity to explore specific methodologies, practiceds, theories, traditions, beliefs, scripttures, and philosophies, as well as allowing for the integration of individual spritual experiences."" They do not have any financial aid to give. This is why I have setup this campaign. The money raised will go directly to the school for tuition. Anything left over will be put towards the two retreats (which are put on by the school) that I get to attend in California.</p>
<p>I have a four year degree from Central Washington University in Supply Chain Management. I have a large amount of student loans to pay back, which is why I was ecstatic when a friend directed me to indiegogo.com. What an amazing find!</p>
<p>Now that I am done with my degree, I am now able to focus a lot more on my spiritual journey again. The $5,000 I need to raise will cover tuition for the school. I have a friend who is in the program already and has agreed to let me use her books which will help out immensely.</p>
<p><strong>How My Path Choose Me</strong></p>
<p>The same friend recently took me to Lame Deer Montana for the 11<sup>th</sup> Gathering of the 13 Indigenous Grandmothers as my graduation present for graduationg from CWU. It was there that I realized what I what I want to do with my life. I want to live up to the Healer I know I can be. I am a light worker and I want to further my knowledge so that I can help others further their knowledge. Being connected to Source is one way that we can help ourselves so that we can help others.</p>
<p>I have researched many different path's, but found that no one was perfect for me. So I decided to take all of the teachings that I have received and use what felt right. From this, I have gathered that there is no one right way, that all are the right way as long as they are for the greatest and highest good for the entire universe.</p>
<p><strong>Paying It Forward </strong><strong>(How your contributions will help me help all)</strong></p>

Hello I am Natasha Huntington and I am trying to raise money so I can go to Center for Sacred Studies. It is an online school for Ministerial Training. The study includes ""opportunity to explore specific methodologies, practiceds, theories, traditions, beliefs, scripttures, and philosophies, as well as allowing for the integration of individual spritual experiences."" They do not have any financial aid to give. This is why I have setup this campaign. The money raised will go directly to the school for tuition. Anything left over will be put towards the two retreats (which are put on by the school) that I get to attend in California.
I have a four year degree from Central Washington University in Supply Chain Management. I have a large amount of student loans to pay back, which is why I was ecstatic when a friend directed me to indiegogo.com. What an amazing find!
Now that I am done with my degree, I am now able to focus a lot more on my spiritual journey again. The $5,000 I need to raise will cover tuition for the school. I have a friend who is in the program already and has agreed to let me use her books which will help out immensely.
How My Path Choose Me
The same friend recently took me to Lame Deer Montana for the 11th Gathering of the 13 Indigenous Grandmothers as my graduation present for graduationg from CWU. It was there that I realized what I what I want to do with my life. I want to live up to the Healer I know I can be. I am a light worker and I want to further my knowledge so that I can help others further their knowledge. Being connected to Source is one way that we can help ourselves so that we can help others.
I have researched many different path's, but found that no one was perfect for me. So I decided to take all of the teachings that I have received and use what felt right. From this, I have gathered that there is no one right way, that all are the right way as long as they are for the greatest and highest good for the entire universe.
Paying It Forward (How your contributions will help me help all)
With this campaign, I will be able to secure the funding to help better myself so I can send a ripple through my community, Earth. As I am able to strengthen my connection with Source, I will be able to contribute much more to everyone around me. I am on my path to enlightenment and I want to help others find their way also.
By helping myself, I feel that I will be better equipped to help the next generation with their awakening when that time comes. Everyone is connected. We are all on the same planet connected by the same web going all around our world. If we are able to higher our vibrations and raise our frequency as individuals, it will have a great effect on the planet as a whole which will lead us to a better world to live in.

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>Hi everyone!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>As many of you probably know, I am Canadian and on a student visa studying at the New School in Manhattan. I finished my first year at this school (and my third year of my undergrad) last May and was on the Dean's list both semesters. I just recently found out that my sources for loans were not able to give me as much money as I needed in order to graduate. I have tried to get more loans and tried many different sources, but am unable to find someone to co-sign a loan for me from the bank and cannot get a loan from the United States because I am not American. I have been able to get some more scholarship money from my school but not enough.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>All of this said- I still need about $2000 (the exact amount is posted in the gallery on this page) for my tuition payment plan by November 1st in order to stay and complete my second last semester before graduating. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>What happens if I fundraise and make over $2000? I will give the world so many hugs, and any additional money donated above the $2000 needed will go towards tuition for next semester!</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>You will be contributing to my education (every dollar helps!), and helping me finish my degree here in the United States! Otherwise, I'd have to go back to Canada and start over.</p>
<p>Another aspect of it is that I am in a relationship with an American who lives here and if I were to lose my student visa, I would have to go back to Canada. Which would mean that we wouldn't get to see each other very much, if at all. We would be having a relationship that is separated by the Canada/US border and hundreds of miles. </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Where is the money going? Straight to my tuition. When you donate to this fundraiser, it is going into my education chequing account which will go directly to my school to pay for tuition. None of the money I raise on here will go towards food, clothing, or any of my personal expenses. Every single cent goes toward my tuition.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>What do you get out of it? You're helping me. You're giving me a chance to finish my education and move forward in life and make something of myself! Not only that, but you're helping to keep two loving and caring individuals to be together. And one day at our wedding (hahaha) you can say: I helped them stay together by contributing to Sarah's tuition so that she could keep her student visa. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>What else? </p>
<p>I'm also a singer-songwriter. I wanna offer anything I can as a thank you for your contribution. Of course all my time and money at the moment needs to go toward paying my tuition. However, I do have a Macbook and I would love to use it to record a song for you. Do you have a cover you'd like to see me do? Do you want one of my originals on your ipod? If you donate $100 or more, I will record an original song for you and email it to you. If you donate $500 or more, I will record a cover of your choosing (within my musical abilities) and record it for you and play it for you live if you live in the New York area. No matter what amount you contribute (no matter how small), I will send you a personal thank you outlining the positive impact you have made on my education and my life right now.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Spread the word! Tell your friends about me and my situation, post it on Facebook, twitter, wherever! Every single dollar helps and I appreciate it more than you know. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Also, if you're feeling ambitious- hold a bake sale! I'll provide the oven and the supplies and come on over and help us do some more fundraising! </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Thank you, thank you, thank you everyone for your continued support. This means a lot to me and I could not do it without your help. </p>

Hi everyone!

As many of you probably know, I am Canadian and on a student visa studying at the New School in Manhattan.

I just recently found out that my sources for loans were not able to give me as much money as I needed in order to graduate.

What happens if I fundraise and make over $2000? I will give the world so many hugs, and any additional money donated above the $2000 needed will go towards tuition for next semester!


The Impact
You will be contributing to my education (every dollar helps!), and helping me finish my degree here in the United States! Otherwise, I'd have to go back to Canada and start over.
Another aspect of it is that I am in a relationship with an American who lives here and if I were to lose my student visa, I would have to go back to Canada. Which would mean that we wouldn't get to see each other very much, if at all. We would be having a relationship that is separated by the Canada/US border and hundreds of miles.

<h3>A Short Summary</h3>
<p>  In December, I plan to unicycle from Baltimore, MD to St.Louis, MO, making several stops along the way.  That's about 1000 miles. I'm a long distance unicyclist with a desire to turn my talent into good!  I've been unicycling for more than 13 years, and by now, riding up to 100 miles in a day is something very feasible for me!   </p>
<p>  Believe or not, this trip is a smaller testpiece for a humongous, world record-breaking trip I will be taking to South America next year!  That fundraiser will be coming later, after this (hopefully) successful trip.</p>

Only $10 gets you a super cool sticker of the same design.  I really appreciate your generosity, EVEN if I've already reached my goal!  I've set my goal to quite a bit lower than it should be, so as to make it more reachable. 75% of all donations will go directly to these charities:</p>

-What we will do-Put together the “go to” website and resource guide for all things student debt which would be located at BackboneCampaign.org/StudentDebt.  -Write articles on the student debt crisis, tuition hikes, and education being a right.-Build a media database which will include print, digital, tv, and radio and legislators for each geographical area which can be utilized for campaigns.-Build a petition website for Backbone which will enable backbone to collect email addresses, reach a wider audience, and more exposure of important issues such as predatory student lending.  The petitions would also encourage more people to submit their student stories and action.     -Make it more than just a petition tool, but have the ability to target your congressperson,     and your local media with the database we have already started compiling.-Possible name: PeopleMobilizer.com / .org
-Assistance with social media and reaching out to media.-Write press releases for Backbone for student debt and other campaign issues and pushing them out through our contacts.-Talks with local high schools and colleges on the student debt crisis and working with community on direct actions (Rallies, teach-ins etc) to engage students on the issue of debt and tuition hikes. We would like to institute a  comprehensive program that educates college students to go into high schools for one day lectures on student debt. . We would like to use recent graduates to come and tell their personal debt stories to students currently in high school and college - Occupy Alumni (we own the .com and .org)                       -Actions- Teach a social media and traditional media class possibly at Localize This and/or other conferences such as the National Student Convergence, SDS conference, etc.- Educate student loan reformers on the importance of getting money out of politics. The two issues need to work in tandem to get anything done.    -Direct Actions (To keep street heat energy directed toward the issues of student debt)    -Sept. 17th Solidarity Rally to celebrate the one year anniversary of OWS        Solidarity actions on college campus with the intent to take over administration buildings     -October 15-17 Global Rally for Students

<p>The idea for The Center rode in on the wings of my daughter.<br/>It was my journey with her and understanding her learning differences<br/>that inspired and led me to the vision of creating The Center for Life and<br/>Learning.  </p>
<p>When you first become aware that your child is not developing<br/>typically, and particularly if you’ve received a diagnosis, as a parent or<br/>caregiver you are instantly thrown into a world you didn’t expect.  Some<br/>say, it’s like landing in Holland when you thought you were going to France and<br/>others say it’s like landing in Beirut.  </p>
<p>Whatever your perspective, it’s a foreign land and no one speaks<br/>your language.  Almost everything that anyone has told you or you know<br/>from raising your other children has been rendered useless.  </p>
<p>You run from place to place, specialist upon specialist, trying<br/>various therapies, looking for support groups, and balancing all of this while<br/>taking care of the rest of your family.  </p>
<p>Our goal at The Center is to help the individuals experiencing the<br/>challenge and to ease the stress on their families.  We take care of both<br/>the child or young adult and their parent or caregiver.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>At The Center we offer some of the most cutting edge holistic<br/>therapies Reiki, Brain Gym, Feldenkrais, CranioSacral Therapy, small<br/>group inclusive yoga classes and Therapeutic Yoga classes for parents and children.  We couple our holistic therapies with more traditional ones like Music Therapy.  </p>

<p>Eddie Madril is a member of the Pascua Yaqui tribe of Southern Arizona and Northern Sonora Mexico. He is an active member of the Native American community and a representative of his culture through various aspects: as a dancer, singer, artist, teacher, playwright and filmmaker. For over twenty-five years, his involvement and commitment to Native heritage has provided him with the opportunity to share a wealth of information amongst diverse communities. His work has included the presentation of assemblies and residencies in Bay Area schools working with students and encouraging the development of appreciation and respect for American Indian dance, music, culture, history, art and sign language.<br/><br/> He was awarded as a three-year recipient of the California Arts Council Artist-In-Residence grant, as well as the San Francisco Foundation individual artists' grant and a grant from the San Francisco Arts Council. He was nominated for the Isadora Duncan Dance Award as a soloist for his hoop dance presentation in his 2008 original play ""SunDagger Solstice” and in 2011 he was recognized by KQED as an Bay Area American Indian Local Hero.</p>
<p><strong><br/>The Fashion Show – Indigenous Couture</strong></p>
<p><em>Friday Nights at the de Young</em> is part of the Fine Arts Museums’ <em>Cultural Encounters Initiative</em>, and has been overwhelmingly popular, regularly drawing our highest attendance days each week with 2,000 to 4,000 visitors per Friday night. <em>Friday Nights</em> is a festival environment that welcomes all age groups and backgrounds. Themes typically relate to the Museums’ permanent collections and special exhibitions, offering the visitors’ new perspectives and insights into the works of art in the galleries.</p>
<p>During <em>The Fashion World of Jean Paul Gaultier’</em>s run at the de Young<em>, Friday Nights</em> will focus on the multi-cultural aspect of Gaultier’s designs, featuring music, costumes, fashion, regalia, and dance performances by local artisits.</p>
<p>Eddie Madril was awarded the opportunity to present “Indigenous Couture” a fashion show of his design using music, story telling, dance, and the catwalk together to share the culture and beauty of American Indian people through both historical and contemporary reflections of style and the role clothing plays in individuality, family and community as an expression of who we are.</p>
<p>On Friday June 22<sup>nd</sup>, through Eddie’s vision the talent and collaboration of local Native American Bay Area artists, craftsmen and designers comes together to feature works representing native regions and nations/tribes of North America - from Alaska, Northwest Coast, and California, to the Southwest, Plains, Northeast, and Southeast regions.</p>

There’s a dire need for computers and modern ICT (Informational and communication Technology) centers especially in the villages where good health and prevention of diseases is a tremendous concern amongs the people. 
Within the Schools, computers will be used to empower academic courses such as Science, Math, Geography and History.

<p>Hi my name is Bryan Buchanan and I teach Technology Education. I am in the process of trying to reform the Technology Curriculum starting in my class! One of the objectives of technology education is to have the student use manufacturing tools to prototype and manipulate the world. The problem is we are using tools that are from the 19th and 20th century! I teach 7<sup>th</sup> grade, which means that they will not be in the “real world” for about 10 years. This means that we need to teach them what will be important and what jobs and careers await them. Right now 3D printing has entered the market with consumer friendly 3D printers. This is the time to educate and inspire our future! Technology is the avenue to all the advanced sciences like; Nanotechnology, Biotechnology, and Artificial Intelligence (Which I teach). By inspiring my students with awe I intend on placing the importance of them being scientifically and technologically literate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What is 3D printing? <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=euZivv8ySyA"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Watch here! </a></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>I have already tried to get the school district to buy these but due to budget cuts and bad economic times this is not a priority</p>
<p><em><strong>By raising $10000:</strong></em></p>
<p>This will allow for the purchase of (4) 3D Makerbot 3D Printers, to be shared by 4 technology teachers.</p>
<p>If the goal is not made: I will purchase as many 3D printers as the funds allow.</p>
<p><strong>***Any additional funds over $10,000</strong> will go directly into the purchase of updating the technology room (Making room for projects that include: <strong><a href=""http://vimeo.com/33150921"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>3D Projection Mapping</strong></a>, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqxF2Vdkyxw"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Augmented Reality</strong></a>, Robotics &amp; Automation, Artificial Intelligence, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J17Qgc4a8xY"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Autonomous Car's</strong></a></strong><strong>, </strong><strong>Biotechnology (<a href=""http://www.abc.net.au/catalyst/stories/3465499.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Regenerative Medicine</strong></a>, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rD5uNAMbDaQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Synthetic Biology</strong></a>, </strong><strong><a href=""http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xpf64e_bionic-body-parts_lifestyle"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bionic Body Parts</a></strong><strong>) Nanotechnology and Renewable Energy Technologies)</strong></p>
<p>Basically the coolest technology class ever!</p>
<p><strong>Additional funds</strong> will also allow me to also purchase more printers for high school classes. So that if the students get interested in design and manufacturing they can continue in a more advanced class.</p>
<p> </p>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>It’s important to understand that technology is what’s driving our futures. It’s imperative to excite these young minds with the possibilities that await them and that we provide them with interests and goals. Once inspired by awe it drives us to accomplish anything! I want to provide these students with an education that when they leave 7<sup>th</sup> grade, they have a clear direction about the future. Too many people now go to college with little understanding about what they want to do.</p>
<p>By reforming Technology Education in the 7<sup>th</sup> and 8<sup>th</sup> grade when it is mandated, we will leave all students itching to learn the higher sciences and mathematics.</p>

<p>As we move into Harvest Hudson Valley's second year we are expanding the scope of this project beyond the Mill Road Elementary Garden Classroom, to include our Middle School and High-school students and develop a Cooking program and a district-wide School Lunch Initiative. <strong>We believe that all students in the Red Hook Central School District should have the opportunity to grow, cook and eat healthy, fresh food at school</strong> and that each stage- growing, cooking and eating- is equally important for the development of lifelong health and nutrition.</p>
<p><strong>The Mill Road Garden Classroom has over 20 classes working in the garden weekly. In collaboration with school administrators and teachers - </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>We are creating more curriculum-based garden lessons for teachers. </strong></li>
<li><strong>We are also working with the school’s district-wide Wellness Committee and Athletics department to establish a Cooking Classroom program for the Fall 2013, where students at all grade levels K-12 will learn basic cooking skills and receive nutritional lessons, with the help of local chefs.</strong></li>
<li><strong>We are getting our School Lunch Initiative well underway —as of November 1, 2012, every cafeteria in our district is offering salad as daily menu option and the students’ response has been tremendous!</strong></li>

<h3>What We Need Right Now to GROW - COOK - EAT</h3>
<p><strong>For the Garden Classroom</strong></p>
<p>$3,000: <strong>Raised beds, including soil, lumber, labor</strong></p>
<p>Raised beds are advantageous to the garden because it delineates garden space neatly and shows children the difference between planted and unplanted space. It helps tremendously in our climate to get a head start on the season with warming and draining the soil faster for directly sown seeds and tender seedlings. It helps to maintain the garden more efficiently and aesthetically with weed control and watering.</p>
<p>             </p>
<p>$500: <strong>Outdoor communication center</strong></p>
<p>This will be helpful with school wide communication about garden tasks, responsibilities and events.  This will allow our garden team to pin messages  &amp; schedules to the cork while protecting it from the elements. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>$500: <strong>Garden Education/curriculum materials Summer Teacher Training</strong></p>
<p>In July of 2013 the Harvest Hudson Valley educator team will offer district teacher training in the form of an on-site workshop. </p>
<p>           </p>
<p>$2,000: <strong>Summer Gardener</strong></p>
<p>We need to keep our garden growing. The summer gardener stipend will ensure that the garden continues weekly management of garden tasks such as weeding, watering, mowing, mulching, composting, harvesting, pest control and succession plantings during the 10 weeks of summer when school is not in session.</p>

<p>We are so lucky to have Clara Wittek as our Food Services Director.  Let’s help Clara bring homemade cooking with fresh ingredients back to the Red Hook Central School District.

<h3>What is the School of Biblical Foundations (SBF)?</h3>
<p>The School of Biblical Foundations is a twelve-week course at Youth With a Mission designed to equip students with the practical skills needed for personal Bible study. This course concentrates primarily on personal study and practical application rather than on an in-depth study of every book of the Bible. The goal of the SBF is to have each graduate trained to study the Word on their own and to develop study disciplines that will last a lifetime.</p>
<p>This school is unique as we will be traveling to Egypt, Jordan, Israel and Greece for on-site study and teaching. We will be traveling from August 9th, 2012 - September 8th, 2012. During our trip we will visit some of the different Biblical sites in each country as well as have historical teaching and background study on some books of the Bible.</p>
<p>For more info on our school please visit: <a href=""http://www.ywamdenver.org/training/school-of-biblical-foundations/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.ywamdenver.org/training/school-of-bi...</a></p>
<h3>What Do We Need?</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>We need $6,000. This is the first time we've run this school and the travel costs and site visits are more than we originally budgeted. This amount is above and beyond what the students have already paid for their school and trip. With your contribution you will make it possible for us to visit more Biblical sites. We will be able to see the Bible come alive before our very eyes.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Who Needs the Money?</h3>
<p>There are eleven students and two staff in the SBF that will be traveling to each country.</p>

<p>Aanii, Bonjour, Hello. My name is Alexandra Hayes and I'm currently a student at Laurentian University in Northern Ontario.  I decided to put myself on here as a ""cause to support"" because I'm down on my luck and could use any help I can get. I've been told by many elders that being strong means knowing when to ask for help. I'm asking now.  I want to one day be a teacher on a reserve in Canada.  I'm terrified because I won't be able to afford school and rent next year.University prices have been rising like crazy lately and rent prices for students have been following them up.</p>
<p>My goal is to raise enough money to help me afford my education, a roof over my head, and nourishment.</p>
<p>I'm so incredibly passionate about Native Studies. I'm already teaching everything I learnt in my first year to all my friends and trying to get them excited as well.</p>
<p>Teaching is important.  I want to have the best education (which Laurentian offers for Native Studies).</p>
<p>The feeling that I have now... Feeling as if my dream of sharing my passion and helping others find their own passions and rights to fight for is honestly the worst feeling I have ever experienced.</p>
</div>
<div>I don't know if joining this website was the right thing for me to do... But I'm hoping against hope that it is. <br/>I hope one day I will be able to give back more to the world than I received.</div>

<h2>Short Summary</h2>
<p>My name is Lim Leanghorng. I am a teacher at Kent Ridge International School. I have been teaching privileged and underprivileged children and teenagers for three years. Every year is my great year but this year is the greatest year because I teach students who are like-minded. And they always seeks for/create opportunity to make positive change in their society. And this project is an example. </p>
<p>While having privilege have access to great books and other source of knowledge, we, my students and I, feel uncomfortable to see other children having no way to get books to read not to mention about a comfortable reading environment because they believe that reading is a foundation of education and bright future. We are, therefore, running <strong>Books Light Future</strong> fundraising campaign to raise fund to create a library for 188 primary school students who are all energetic and enthusiastic readers yet have no means to access to books and comfortable reading space which is called <strong>LIBRARY</strong>.  </p>

<h2>Project Description </h2>
<h3>Our vision statement</h3>
<p>We work to create a library in which each and every child at Por Pei Krom Primary School can explore and fulfill his/her full potential through reading.</p>
<h3>What we do</h3>
<p style=""margin-left:.25in;"">We do this through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating a welcoming and inspiring reading space for students</li>
<li>Purchasing age- and level-appropriate books which are recognized by MOEYS</li>
<li>Involving teachers and school leaders in the project</li>
<li>Developing and designing reading programme for all students at the school</li>
<li>Engaging reading experience sharing between KIS students and students at the primary school so that they inspire each other to read.  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Our planned outcomes</h3>
<p style=""margin-left:.25in;"">The followings are the planned outcomes of the project:</p>
<ul>
<li>A library will be created for students. The library will open for other students who are from nearby school to read as well.</li>
<li>Library hour will be added in school schedule at Por Pei Krom Primary School</li>
<li>Access to books will no longer a barrier for student-readers at Por Pei Krom Primary School</li>
<li>A regular reading experience sharing between KIS students and students at Por Pei Krom</li>
</ul>
<h2>Sustainability</h2>
<p>The library will be managed by school leaders and a librarian.  Moreover, the fact that library hour will be added into students’ schedule truly encourages struggling readers to read because there will be a librarian and a teacher to help them in reading and choosing right books for them during library hour. Furthermore, the reading experience sharing session between KIS students and students at the primary school enables each of them to inspire each other to read. Once the library is functioned, the students will be encouraged to read and explore the world around through books. Once they are passionate reading and exploring new knowledge, they are more likely to successfully pursue their higher education, and hence they become independent and life-long learners. When these children grow up, they would be encouraged to support library and reading project for their wider community because they are all passionate readers.</p>
<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p>We aim to raise 700$ to our project to buy 200 reading books and library materials such as bookshelves, tables and chairs. If we can get more budget, we will buy more books for the library. </p>
<p>You will get a thank you email with the picture of library and children for any amount of donation. In addition, </p>
<p>- Your name will be printed on 5 reading books for donation of 10$-20$ </p>
<p>- Your name will be printed on the library wall for the donation of more than 20$</p>
<p>Money cannot buy knowledge, but it can buy books and create a library where readers can explore and obtain knowledge based on their interest and passion. </p>
</div><div><h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2></div><div><p> Sharing our campaign to your friends on social media and forwarding it to people who might be interested in contributing in our project will be highly appreciated, and it is another way to support our project and make difference.  </p></div></div>","Short Summary

Creating a welcoming and inspiring reading space for students
Purchasing age- and level-appropriate books which are recognized by MOEYS
Involving teachers and school leaders in the project
Developing and designing reading programme for all students at the school
Engaging reading experience sharing between KIS students and students at the primary school so that they inspire each other to read.  

Our planned outcomes
The followings are the planned outcomes of the project:

A library will be created for students. The library will open for other students who are from nearby school to read as well.
Library hour will be added in school schedule at Por Pei Krom Primary School
Access to books will no longer a barrier for student-readers at Por Pei Krom Primary School
A regular reading experience sharing between KIS students and students at Por Pei Krom

Sustainability
The library will be managed by school leaders and a librarian.  Moreover, the fact that library hour will be added into students’ schedule truly encourages struggling readers to read because there will be a librarian and a teacher to help them in reading and choosing right books for them during library hour. Furthermore, the reading experience sharing session between KIS students and students at the primary school enables each of them to inspire each other to read. Once the library is functioned, the students will be encouraged to read and explore the world around through books. Once they are passionate reading and exploring new knowledge, they are more likely to successfully pursue their higher education, and hence they become independent and life-long learners. When these children grow up, they would be encouraged to support library and reading project for their wider community because they are all passionate readers.
What We Need & What You Get
We aim to raise 700$ to our project to buy 200 reading books and library materials such as bookshelves, tables and chairs. If we can get more budget, we will buy more books for the library. 
You will get a thank you email with the picture of library and children for any amount of donation. In addition, 
- Your name will be printed on 5 reading books for donation of 10$-20$ 
- Your name will be printed on the library wall for the donation of more than 20$
Money cannot buy knowledge, but it can buy books and create a library where readers can explore and obtain knowledge based on their interest and passion. 
Other Ways You Can Help Sharing our campaign to your friends on social media and forwarding it to people who might be interested in contributing in our project will be highly appreciated, and it is another way to support our project and make difference.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

This entails picking a community need, however large or small it may be, and doing whatever you can to make a difference. This year we're teaming up with <i>She's The First</i>, and raising enough money to support a girl in India through four years of secondary school ($1,600 per year).  Education enables women to do powerful and great things and without this basic need, our world isn't complete.  Women make up half of the world's brainpower and we need to harness all of our creativity and knowledge in order to better the world.

These fundraisers include a movie night at our school, at which we will show a movie highlighting the necessity of a rise in girls education in developing countries. We are also planning a Holi Hai, or spring awakening, color festival, to bring the culture of India to our town and to help reach our goal of $6,500. All funds raised will go <i>directly</i> to the secondary education of a girl in India  at the <i>Shanti Bhavan</i> school, where they instill the idea that ""a better world isn't just and idea, but a real possibility"".  </span><br/></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><br/></span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><b><i>About the Shanti Bhavan School</i></b></span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Shanti Bhavan is a school located in rural India.

This entails picking a community need, however large or small it may be, and doing whatever you can to make a difference. This year we're teaming up with She's The First, and raising enough money to support a girl in India through four years of secondary school ($1,600 per year).  Education enables women to do powerful and great things and without this basic need, our world isn't complete.  Women make up half of the world's brainpower and we need to harness all of our creativity and knowledge in order to better the world. Your donation to our cause can help us make the world a better place- one girl at a time.  Our MissionNot only do we want to raise money, but also raise awareness. A lot of people, including ourselves, don't realize how lucky we are when it comes to receiving a quality education. This is an opportunity to not only help other girls, but to also learn about their culture. That is why, along with this campaign we will be organizing multiple fundraisers in 2015. These fundraisers include a movie night at our school, at which we will show a movie highlighting the necessity of a rise in girls education in developing countries. We are also planning a Holi Hai, or spring awakening, color festival, to bring the culture of India to our town and to help reach our goal of $6,500. All funds raised will go directly to the secondary education of a girl in India  at the Shanti Bhavan school, where they instill the idea that ""a better world isn't just and idea, but a real possibility"".  About the Shanti Bhavan SchoolShanti Bhavan is a school located in rural India. ""[Their] mission is to adequately develop the most vulnerable and disadvantaged children of India’s “lowest caste” by providing them world class education and instilling globally shared values to enable them to aspire to careers and professions of their choice."" Past AccomplishmentsIn 2012, we supported a woman in Tanzania who had been given the opportunity to receive an education from a program called AWEF (African Women's Education Fund), and become a teacher.  We raised over $800 which we sent to her in an effort to help provide school supplies for her classroom. We wanted to show that when women are given an education, they can do great things. In 2013, we worked with a program called ""DIL"" (Developments In Literacy). We raised around $1,200 to support 400 girls in Pakistan, and provide them with school supplies for a year.Any donation small or large makes an impact.

That is why in order to make these 10 days count, <strong>a mentor is assigned to each project group</strong> according to the topic at hand. A mentor is not only a teacher, but also a wise friend who supports the participants during the whole period of project implementation. In this way we can keep in touch with <strong>all the Forum participants</strong> when they go home, giving them constructive <strong>feedback</strong> and making sure they are <strong>working on their projects.</strong></p><p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1521840809/iol2a4msy4phhsnhoxm3.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Why is it important?</h3><p>CACTUS is all about<strong> people and growth.</strong> Over the 10 days spent at the Forum the teenagers discover new facets of their personality as well as numerous issues relevant for Ukraine and the world, such as <strong>environment, inclusion, education, and human rights. </strong>Getting up-to-date information about these topics, participants go on to address them in their projects.

The NGO has been functioning for 9 years thanks to small grants, in-kind donations, and local fundraising, being supported by people who are truly dedicated to the CACTUS mission - making a change. However, the funds the NGO possesses right now are not enough to hold the 10th anniversary Forum and implement the whole Forum curriculum.That is why CACTUS needs additional funding for:accommodation. 60 participants - $4/day - $40/10 days - $2,400 in total;25 staff members (Ukrainian and international volunteers/trainers) - $4/day - $40/10 days - $1,000 in total;20 guest speakers - $4/day - $80 in total.meals.​60 participants - $5/day - $50/10 days - $3,000 in total;25 staff members (Ukrainian and international volunteers/trainers) - $5/day - $50/10 days - $1,250 in total;20 guest speakers - $5/day - $100 in total.
other expenditures (e.g. transport, venue rental, media equipment, stationery, printouts).All the costs add up to $8,000. However, we set a goal of $7,000 since we will cover the remaining $1,000 with the help of local fundraising and our partner organizations that can provide partial monetary (Rotary Club) and material (Morshinska, local IT companies) support.​Where will the funds go if we don't reach our entire goal? CACTUS will fundraise the remaining sum locally (e.g. contacting local partner organizations and sponsors, organizing charitable events, selling CACTUS merchandise) and will use all the available funds (from the Indiegogo donations and local fundraising) for the Forum expenditures. What can you get for contributing to CACTUS?We appreciate your contribution to CACTUS, and that is why besides successful community projects implemented by our participants, we offer the following items that help us promote CACTUS both directly and indirectly:

report on the funds use for all backers;

CACTUS stickers for $10+ contribution;

CACTUS bag for $25+ contribution;

CACTUS notebook for $50+ contribution;

CACTUS T-shirt for $100+ contribution;

CACTUS sweatshirt for $300+ contribution.

What about challenges?It is not easy to bring together 60 teenagers in summer and encourage them to work, but it is even harder to ensure the sustainability and lasting impact of the Forum after the event itself. That is why in order to make these 10 days count, a mentor is assigned to each project group according to the topic at hand. A mentor is not only a teacher, but also a wise friend who supports the participants during the whole period of project implementation. In this way we can keep in touch with all the Forum participants when they go home, giving them constructive feedback and making sure they are working on their projects.Why is it important?CACTUS is all about people and growth. Over the 10 days spent at the Forum the teenagers discover new facets of their personality as well as numerous issues relevant for Ukraine and the world, such as environment, inclusion, education, and human rights. Getting up-to-date information about these topics, participants go on to address them in their projects. Moreover, by the end of the Forum they have complete profiles of their projects: goals and objectives, budget, action and sustainability plans. Once the Forum is over, there is but one step left - make the project a reality.CACTUS brings not the destination but the starting point to the lives of the people engaged. Not only do the participants become leaders in their communities, but they also enter leading Ukrainian and international universities, build successful careers and keep on supporting CACTUS. Thus, over the 9 years of CACTUS work

11,000 people have participated in CACTUS activities;

130 community projects have been implemented;

600 volunteers have contributed to CACTUS (among them volunteers from 5 continents);

1,009 teenagers benefited from CACTUS in 2017.

 Some examples of successful projects? !НАВАЖСЯ! (literally: !I DARE YOU!)One of a number of projects successfully implemented by the participants of the CACTUS Forum 2017 is ""!НАВАЖСЯ!"" (literally: ""!I DARE YOU!""). Olena Kyslovska (16 y.o.) and Polina Chesnokova (14 y.o.) tackled the topic of inclusion in Ukraine. The girls worked with a group of students from a specialized school for children with special needs in Kyiv for 2 months. Over this time Olena and Polina have held 6 seminars, 2 workshops, 1 social event and 1 meeting with a guest speaker from the field. The girls covered such topics as leadership, team work, dealing with fear and anxiety, educational opportunities, and, most importantly, showed the children with special needs that the Ukrainian society is inclusion-friendly and there are a lot of opportunities for them to get involved! Olena and Polina have won a Diamond Challenge for High School Entrepreneurs award and are planning to expand their project.The project FB page: https://www.facebook.com/navazhsya/Un-Bottom Waste BinKateryna Malkina (16 y.o.) from Mariupol has created an ecological project dealing with an innovative way of plastic utilization by one of larvae species. Her project consists of 2 directions: scientific and social. Kateryna is working on the project in her school lab, examining the behavior of larvae in different environments over a specific period of time. She has also held a meeting with students at one of local schools where she spoke about her project as well as about the environmental challenges and our role in them in the context of Ukraine and the world. Kateryna has won a number of scientific contests in such countries as Ukraine, the Netherlands, the USA, Brazil, presenting her project on the international level.Have we missed anything?The only thing CACTUS lacks right now is YOUR contribution. Think about it - you can skip having a cup of coffee today and cover a $5-meal for one CACTUS participant!Are there other ways to help?There are for sure. You can:

apply for a CACTUS trainer's position and join the international staff members team for the CACTUS Forum 2018;

share the CACTUS campaign via social media and encourage your friends to support us;

Transform the Lives of Afghan Girls
We are Principle Pictures, and we learned about the need for this college while filming the feature

Reason for Campaign

Most recently, the Federalist Society's prestigious ""Engage"" law journal published Dranias' legal analysis of the Compact for a Balanced Budget.
Every dollar counts. Educating your fellow citizens about the Compact for a Balanced Budget and persuading 36 more states and simple majorities of Congress  to join it will require millions of dollars to succeed-and save trillions of dollars for our kids when it does


Risks & Challenges

  The Compact for America initiative is a huge and heavy lift, which will likely require both educational and lobbying resources in the millions of dollars. But with success in two states already, and sustained polling data showing the American people want to fix the national debt, it is a lift worth shouldering. What is the alternative?
This campaign is a small but important component of an overall strategic plan leveraging affiliated and allied entities across the country. The team leading and managing the Compact for America effort is unmatched by any other policy group.
  Other Ways You Can Help If you do not have the capacity to donate to this effort, or if you want to help beyond a donation, please join us at a huge ""Liberty Amendment"" symposium and dinner hosted by CFA and States United for a Balanced Budget at the Tucson Hilton El Conquistador on October 18!

<p>The <b><a href=""http://savecooperunion.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Committee to Save Cooper Union</a></b> is pursuing legal action as a last
 resort after Cooper Union’s Board of Trustees and administration 
proceeded with their plans to abolish a 150 year tradition of free 
tuition enshrined in the <a href=""http://library.cooper.edu/archive/charter/cu_charter_1.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Charter</a> of the school, refusing alternatives that would preserve free tuition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A Working Group of faculty, students and alumni elected by their respective constituencies had developed a <a href=""http://cooper.edu/sites/default/files/uploads/assets/site/files/2013/WrkingGrpRpt_1212.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">sustainable plan</a> for preserving free tuition that was supported by the Faculty Union, the alumni association and students. The President and Board refused to accept this plan and chose to press on with their plan to charge tuition.<br/></p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FEym77yQTZoI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DEym77yQTZoI&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FEym77yQTZoI%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><p>After carefully evaluating all of the legal options for both legal 
and cost-effectiveness, the Committee to Save Cooper Union decided that 
the best approach is to seek an injunction against charging tuition in 
New York Supreme Court. This option also allows us to <a href=""http://savecooperunion.org/Cooper_Union_Petition_5-27-14.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">petition the court</a>
 for formation of “The Associates of Cooper Union” as required by the 
Cooper Union charter. The Associates would serve as a check on the Board
 of Trustees since the Associates' elected Council can remove Trustees 
by majority vote. This route also allows us to petition the court for an
 audit, as provided for in the charter, to help provide more detail on 
the fiscal mismanagement happening at Cooper Union.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/612481/files/20140529122346-Screen_Shot_2014-05-29_at_3.23.13_PM.png?1401391426"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p>

View our new campaign here: http://igg.me/p/929623Please note that any donations past the Phase 1 $150,000 goal will automatically be applied to Phase 2 of our fundraising (see below).About The Legal Action
The Committee to Save Cooper Union is pursuing legal action as a last
 resort after Cooper Union’s Board of Trustees and administration 
proceeded with their plans to abolish a 150 year tradition of free 
tuition enshrined in the Charter of the school, refusing alternatives that would preserve free tuition.

A Working Group of faculty, students and alumni elected by their respective constituencies had developed a sustainable plan for preserving free tuition that was supported by the Faculty Union, the alumni association and students. The President and Board refused to accept this plan and chose to press on with their plan to charge tuition.After carefully evaluating all of the legal options for both legal 
and cost-effectiveness, the Committee to Save Cooper Union decided that 
the best approach is to seek an injunction against charging tuition in 
New York Supreme Court. This option also allows us to petition the court
 for formation of “The Associates of Cooper Union” as required by the 
Cooper Union charter. The Associates would serve as a check on the Board
 of Trustees since the Associates' elected Council can remove Trustees 
by majority vote. This route also allows us to petition the court for an
 audit, as provided for in the charter, to help provide more detail on 
the fiscal mismanagement happening at Cooper Union.
The New Academic BuildingOne especially noteworthy fiscal issue is the Board and 
administration deciding to build an extravagant new academic building 
costing over $165 million before raising adequate funds for it. In addition, the Board and administration appear to have severely 
undervalued the Chrysler building when they renegotiated the lease with 
Tishman Speyer. There are also more recent examples of fiscal 
waste including spending $50,000 on celebrity speaker Fareed Zakaria, 
spending a total of $350,000 for Jamshed Bharucha’s inauguration 
celebration, excessive spending on private security, and spending about 
$1.5 million on consultants for supporting President Bharucha’s program 
of “reinvention” for Cooper Union.
Lack of fiscal discipline on the part of the Board is also 
demonstrated by their lack of follow-through on their Master Plan 
commitment to reduce operating expenses by 10% by 2011. This commitment 
to reduce operating expenses was also explicitly stated in the Board’s 
2006 sworn cy pres petition to the New York Supreme Court filed in order
 to allow the Board to borrow against the Chrysler building revenue. 
Instead of being reduced, expenses steadily rose from $43.7 million in 
2006 to $66.8 million in 2010 (if debt service and depreciation are 
excluded, the rise was from $39.4m to $49.8m.) Unlike the Board’s fiscal recklessness, the Working Group plan embodies the creative fiscal 
discipline that enabled Cooper Union to survive as a free tuition 
institution for over 150 years.

Pérez-Litwin and her indirect mentorship, as well as connection with fearless bloggers and writers through the Latina Leadership Network, inspired me to launch an ""anonymous"" blog (see www.caciqueinme.wordpress.com) in October 2013.  Although it thrived for five precious, short months, I decided to pause writing for a number of reasons…and refocus my purpose...as well as establish writing goals.  During this period, I submitted a piece entitled Preparando para las Navidades en la Casa de Abuela as a special contributor to LaRespuesta Media, a provocative online media community cultivating points of connection among all Boricua people as well as honoring and recognizing the distinctiveness of the Puerto Rican Diaspora.  In early 2014, I attended a pre-cursor seminar to the Writing Our Lives workshop with Vanessa Mártir at Hunter College and later shared my deeply personal and painful story with LaRespuesta Media about seeing the light in life after a suicide attempt through a piece entitled Light and Love After Darkness.Additionally, I attended the Las Comadres Writers Conference at CUNY-Medgar Evers College in my native hometown of Brooklyn, NY, in the Fall of 2013 and again in Fall 2014 as well as completed a brief memoir-writing workshop at The Writer's Center in Bethesda, MD, shortly thereafter.  My writing has garnered mix reviews…stemming from ""God bless you"" to ""Why do you have to write about our family?"" to ""I never knew you were in so much pain.""  To me, writing is cathartic.  It allows me to connect with others who may have experienced similar circumstances…or not.  It makes me human.  It brings me joy.  Expressing myself through writing has been painful but has also brought me back to life.  I write to have a voice, give my family a voice, and to encourage my daughters to use their voices and realize their dreams.Please support me and help me thrive at the VONA Voices Memoir Writing Workshop from June 28 through July 4, 2015, with Andrew X. Pham at the University of Miami.  The financial support requested ($1,150) will cover airfare and related workshop activities that will include but not be limited to a full week of classes, speakers, seminars, and public readings.  I thank you in advance for your thoughtful contribution but want you to know that your emotional support of this endeavor is not only appreciated…but priceless.With gratitude,Yesenia",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<div>Imagine a classroom of AP Computer Science students, excited and fresh-faced; maybe they've never written a line of code in their life, maybe they're super-guru-experts chomping at the bit to show up the teacher; every one seated at a desk, attention rapt, ready to hit the keyboard. Now imagine telling them they don't have keyboards. In fact, they don't have computers: not in the classroom, maybe not even at home. 15% of Americans don't, after all.</div>
<div>The reality is, this AP class will only be successful if it can provide for this need, but school budgets are thin, computer labs are overbooked, and even if they can provide the classroom environment -- with all the applications and tools implicit therein -- the students who cannot access a computer outside the classroom will likely not succeed.</div>
<h1><b>Light as a...</b></h1>
<div>For the past year, I have been developing a solution to one classroom's needs. I call it ""feathers"". With a feather, any computer can be transformed into an identical working environment for AP Computer Science students. Everything is completely self-contained, and completely homogeneous. When the student is done, they can turn off the computer and everything will be back the way it was before they started. A feather makes no permanent changes, and no permanent changes can be made to it -- turn it back on, and it's totally reset.</div>
<div>A feather can be a USB stick, a CD, or even distributed across a network. I can set up the feathers and adapt them to the requests of the teacher. Right now, the class is running 10 feathers every day on a set of old computers the school was simply going to throw out. That's the beauty: feathers are incredibly lightweight. They will run on outdated hardware without a hitch and guarantee the same student experience day in and day out. The teacher doesn't even have them hooked up to the internet (although he could.)</div>
<h2>The Challenge</h2>
<div>The feathers we have work great and will hopefully continue to do so. However, they only solve part of the problem. In order to do their homework, students need something outside of the classroom. Ideally, it would look something like what happens during class.</div>
<div>What I intend to do is take our feathers to the cloud. A server could provide a flock of feathers, accessible over the internet, to the students. Everyone would be on a level playing field. Students could use a feather from one computer and then switch to another, or multiple students could collaborate by working on a single feather. When it came time to turn in homework, they could do so from anywhere. If the teacher needed to distribute the assignment or provide some resource to the students, he could do so with ease.</div>
<h2>What We Need</h2>
<div>I am a volunteer. I have charged nothing for my services. However, it is not within my power to purchase a server for the teacher, and neither is it in his power to do so for himself. That's where you come in! Through <i>Feathers for STEM Education</i> I am trying to raise enough money to purchase computer equipment for his classroom -- namely, a server to host feathers. Every dollar raised by this campaign will help an AP Computer Science classroom at Lee M. Thurston High School in Redford, MI. Thurston is in a socioeconomically disadvantaged area.</div><div>The figure chosen was based on practical estimates of purchasing costs, as well as an evaluation of the cost of existing cloud solutions. For comparison, equivalent resources from Amazon's EC2 service would cost over $4000.</div><div>If I succeed, it will be a further opportunity for me to expand the power of feathers, refine the design, and ultimately make it available to other teachers and schools.</div><h2>What I Want</h2><div>Feathers are based wholly on free, open-source technology and I want them to stay that way.

<p>The impact of our work has already been seen, especially by our founder, Madeline Harris.  Within the first week we released our first PSA, many people privately shared their stories of survival with Madeline.  Each survivor had never before come forward about their assault, and some didn't even realize they had been assaulted, until they watched the PSA.</p>

<p>We've also started important dialogues with parents and guardians of younger adults and children.  Many of whom have begun to grasp the importance of teaching consent to their sons and daughters as part of their sexual education.</p>
<p>We are currently in the process of obtaining our 501(c)(3) nonprofit status.  Going forward, these PSA's will be inserted into educational packages that we are creating to take to high schools and colleges across the country so we can continue this important dialogue in hopes to prevent future assaults.</p>

<p>As a healer by nature and an educator in practice, I profoundly believe in the power of mindful speech, thought and action to radically change our world. This February 2015, I have the opportunity to travel to Bali, Indonesia, to complete an in-depth 500 hour professional yoga teacher training program called Shakti Initation. Alongside a group of twenty-three other women and two master female yoga teachers, I will spend five weeks deepening my skills as a leader, educator and yoga teacher in order to emerge with a skill set equipped to transform our world for hope, healing and positive transformation.</p>
<p>This advanced training program forms the next crucial step in my development as a teacher. Your contribution is not only an investment in my life journey, but palpable, direct support to the countless number of lives that I will engage with and bring light, hope and healing to as a result of this training. As an experienced leader, successful entrepreneur, and passionately engaged citizen I am committed to bring the depth and richness of this experience back to my community, locally in Western Massachusetts and internationally.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>The cost of the program is $4,800, which does not include international flights or travel insurance. My intention is to raise $5,000, the full program tuiton cost plus $200 additional to contribute toward my flight costs.</p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>I cannot stress enough the difference your contribution will make. </p>
<p>My intention upon graduating from this program at the end of March, 2015 is to continue to work with adolescent girls in leadership development and female youth empowerment. I have worked with high school girls for over four years as a classroom educator, mentor and yoga teacher, and feel passionately about helping female youth grow up to feel empowered, capable, creative and beautiful. I intend to work in and outside of local school systems in the northeast as a professional yoga teacher upon my return.</p>
<p>Did you know? -- I am an experienced, seasoned world-traveler. When I was 20 years old at Amherst College, I founded an international non-profit education initiative in rural Costa Rica, Beyond el Campo, that has brought over 2,000 books, strategic programing, and sustainable community development to a small farming community. My love of people, passion for justice and direct engagement with the world around me propels me forward to new ventures and I am thrilled to not only complete this teacher training, but for all of the meaningful work I will be able to engage with upon graduating.</p>
</div><div><ul></ul></div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Can't contribute today? That's OK-- Spread the word! Tell your fellow yogi friends, teachers and healing practitioners to support me in my pursuit!</p>

This February 2015, I have the opportunity to travel to Bali, Indonesia, to complete an in-depth 500 hour professional yoga teacher training program called Shakti Initation. Alongside a group of twenty-three other women and two master female yoga teachers, I will spend five weeks deepening my skills as a leader, educator and yoga teacher in order to emerge with a skill set equipped to transform our world for hope, healing and positive transformation.
This advanced training program forms the next crucial step in my development as a teacher. Your contribution is not only an investment in my life journey, but palpable, direct support to the countless number of lives that I will engage with and bring light, hope and healing to as a result of this training. As an experienced leader, successful entrepreneur, and passionately engaged citizen I am committed to bring the depth and richness of this experience back to my community, locally in Western Massachusetts and internationally.   What We Need & What You Get The cost of the program is $4,800, which does not include international flights or travel insurance. My intention is to raise $5,000, the full program tuiton cost plus $200 additional to contribute toward my flight costs.

  The Impact I cannot stress enough the difference your contribution will make. 
My intention upon graduating from this program at the end of March, 2015 is to continue to work with adolescent girls in leadership development and female youth empowerment. I have worked with high school girls for over four years as a classroom educator, mentor and yoga teacher, and feel passionately about helping female youth grow up to feel empowered, capable, creative and beautiful. I intend to work in and outside of local school systems in the northeast as a professional yoga teacher upon my return.
Did you know? -- I am an experienced, seasoned world-traveler. When I was 20 years old at Amherst College, I founded an international non-profit education initiative in rural Costa Rica, Beyond el Campo, that has brought over 2,000 books, strategic programing, and sustainable community development to a small farming community. My love of people, passion for justice and direct engagement with the world around me propels me forward to new ventures and I am thrilled to not only complete this teacher training, but for all of the meaningful work I will be able to engage with upon graduating.
  Other Ways You Can Help Can't contribute today? That's OK-- Spread the word! Tell your fellow yogi friends, teachers and healing practitioners to support me in my pursuit!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

You can help make the dreams of our students a reality. Join us in believing in their dreams and their ability to reach their dreams.

<p>As teachers to an amazing group of 24 5th graders in Washington, DC, we have a combination of over 50 years of experience working with some of our nations most eager learners. Our students strive for excellence, work for their dreams and pursue them without fear. In all of our years, we have not taken a group on a large scale trip such as Space Camp. However, after Vanessa Ford ( STEM teacher) attended the Honeywell Educator @ Space Academy in June of this year, she was changed. She came back knowing that she, along with all of us, had to make this experience a reality for our 5th grade class. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b><i>""It will be great to have these experience

<p>Our 5th graders have been together as a community of learners for over 7 years!  (We start preschool at age 3 here in DC!)

<li>I am a Management Consultant by expertise (having spent 9.5 years in 3 of the top Global Management Consulting firms), but a Spiritual woman in all things that I aspire to achieve. I have lived all my life in South Africa, having been brought up and educated in Durban, Kwazulu Natal, and worked in Johannesburg, Gauteng. I have prided myself in being educated, but also in being able to analyse a situation and make rational decisions. I am passionate about people, food, travel and God. </li> <li>I strive to live in the present time, which translates into me doing something NOW that will move South Africa towards being an ethically operated country that is for the people, by the people. I left the corporate consulting world as I want to make a change at the individual level, where these individuals create unique offerings that will also drive South Africa forward and create employment. I believe this is only possible through Education. SkillKindle SA is one form of technology that will assist to drive the dream that I share with many South Africans. I have seen it operational in both the United States (the model has evolved given the maturity of the internet in the United States) and in India, where Learners and Teachers alike have seen considerable progress in the development of skills. </li> <li>By contributing to SkillKindle SA, you will do more than make my dream a reality! There are millions of South Africans who seek skills development in South Africa. Finding a Teacher who has a vested interest in their development (career and personal), and one whose class is accessible to the Learner, is not easy. There are many Teachers who have a skill to provide, but do not have the means to market their offering. Through SkillKindle SA, your contribution will increase transparency of the Teacher's performance and  accessibility to millions of potential Learners with no limit on age, as well as create an efficient market place for Teachers to present their offering and create employment.</li>
</ul><p></p> <p> </p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Through a detailed business case, I have assessed that SkillKindle SA requires a minimum of $40,000.00 contribution to meet some of the goals for the first phase implementation (over and above my $10,000.00 contribution).</p> <ul>

I hope to take this journey because of people like you who care as much as I do about education!</p></div>","Short Summary SkillKindle SA is a concept in development stages in South Africa, having already been successful in India, and is one of the ways in which MD of Connect for Purpose aims to improve the skills of South Africans,  thereby advancing South Africa and helping achieve the dreams of late President of the Republic of South Africa (Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela) ""Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.""   
I am a Management Consultant by expertise (having spent 9.5 years in 3 of the top Global Management Consulting firms), but a Spiritual woman in all things that I aspire to achieve. I have lived all my life in South Africa, having been brought up and educated in Durban, Kwazulu Natal, and worked in Johannesburg, Gauteng. I have prided myself in being educated, but also in being able to analyse a situation and make rational decisions. I am passionate about people, food, travel and God.  I strive to live in the present time, which translates into me doing something NOW that will move South Africa towards being an ethically operated country that is for the people, by the people. I left the corporate consulting world as I want to make a change at the individual level, where these individuals create unique offerings that will also drive South Africa forward and create employment. I believe this is only possible through Education. SkillKindle SA is one form of technology that will assist to drive the dream that I share with many South Africans. I have seen it operational in both the United States (the model has evolved given the maturity of the internet in the United States) and in India, where Learners and Teachers alike have seen considerable progress in the development of skills.  By contributing to SkillKindle SA, you will do more than make my dream a reality! There are millions of South Africans who seek skills development in South Africa. Finding a Teacher who has a vested interest in their development (career and personal), and one whose class is accessible to the Learner, is not easy. There are many Teachers who have a skill to provide, but do not have the means to market their offering. Through SkillKindle SA, your contribution will increase transparency of the Teacher's performance and  accessibility to millions of potential Learners with no limit on age, as well as create an efficient market place for Teachers to present their offering and create employment.
  What We Need & What You Get Through a detailed business case, I have assessed that SkillKindle SA requires a minimum of $40,000.00 contribution to meet some of the goals for the first phase implementation (over and above my $10,000.00 contribution). 
This covers part of the initial design, development and implementation, but additional support is required for  ongoing maintenance of the website and database, employment of individuals who will verify the authenticity of the training programmes, find Teachers in areas outside of large cities and provide support for Learners and Teachers, contact centres to support the Learners and Teachers, and most importantly, marketing the offering across South Africa. I would not be able to Thank You enough for helping to make this dream a reality. I believe you will contribute because you too believe in the power of education. What better way to be rewarded than to: Have a Teacher be able to list their course for free; Sponsor a learner to attend a class.

Each and every Dollar contributed will be beneficial and will contribute to making this a success. Each Dollar will be accounted for as it is received and as payments are made. I will keep all Contributors informed throughout the process, and you will see the rise in Learners who have developed a skill as SkillKindle SA grows.
   The Impact How will your contribution make an impact: 
In 2011, 20% of South Africans were living in extreme poverty, and 45% in moderate poverty. SkillKindle SA aims to improve this statistic by increasing the capability of South Africans, and expose the people of South Africa to skills they can use to earn a living
Every $1 earned contributes to bringing a platform to South Africans that provides people with a skill to deliver a platform to reach learners around them; It also providers learners greater transparency on the training providers With increased transparency, you will help contribute towards improved technical ability of South Africans, and thereby contribute towards the growth of a country and enablement of people to move above the poverty line   Risks & Challenges  Reaching all South Africans given the lack of access to technology and risk averseness of skills providers will prove difficult.  Thankfully, the State of the Nation address in June 2014 declared that access to internet services will improve. 
As a first step for SkillKindle SA, the platform will be introduced in urban areas to test the solution, and increase awareness.
With a working solution in place, I will then work closely with skills developers in South Africa who have had exposure to developing learners in Rural and peri-Urban areas, to develop strategies to increase skills development in this area, including mentoring and coaching potential skills developers in these areas In expanding this solution, alternate methods of information dissemination will be looked into e.g. SMS communication, mobile payment systems, interaction in schools, etc.
Thankfully, the State of the Nation address in June 2014 declared that access to internet services will improve, which will improve access to find the trainers.
   Other Ways You Can Help If you are as passionate about SkillKindle SA as I am, then please pass on the word 
If you know people in South Africa, ask them to get involved in introducing skills providers (Trainers). They can email the provider's details to Verushka@skillkindle.com If you believe people would want to contribute resources beyond what we are asking and be involved post the initial Go Live, please pass on these details to them.

“A Pathway to College” which is still used as the basis for McRae-Gaines’

school, the individual attention they received from all of their teachers, and
the confidence they had in their academic preparation when they entered high
school in the Selma City School System. The school’s contribution to confident
and prepared students as they continued their education is measurable and
significant.  Graduates from McRae-Gaines have completed their studies at colleges and universities throughout the United States. These students

to the economic downturn in the Black Belt of Alabama over the past 15 years,
McRae-Gaines Learning Center has returned to its founding mandate as a
certified provider of child-care and pre-school programming for the State of
Alabama Department of Human Resources. The school also partners with the
Wallace Community College Selma to provide single and low-income parents with
affordable child care while enrolled in classes at the college.  In
addition, McRae-Gaines houses the award-winning OSR program for 4-year old
kindergarten students and continues educating our children through the Second
Grade. Since the late 1990s many of our parents affiliated with the school lack
the benefit of a higher education or training and face fierce competition for
the few jobs available in Dallas County. The unemployment rate in Dallas County
is 13.7% and the underemployment rate is 29.8%. About 43.5% of
the population is below the Federal poverty line, including 46.5% of children
under the age of 18.

<p>Our fall robotics competition is called BEST, which is a competition that gives us six weeks to build a highly functioning robot. It will also require us to build a booth exhibit, make our own practice field, and participate in a variety of smaller projects.</p>
<p>New Vista Robotics is unfunded, and while our main robot materials are donated, we must raise money to pay for all tools, additional materials, food, and travel to local and regional events. Each year we raise money by selling donuts and working parking at CU games, but still come up short of what is needed to run the club. The club was invited to BEST Regionals in 2015 and raised $3000 on IndieGogo to make the trip. Not only do we need to raise that amount again, but we are in need of some equipment (<strong>table saw, chop saw, drill bits, saw blades, tap and die set, drill wireless, build materials, plywood, etc.</strong>). We haven’t purchased any new equipment in 2 years. We’ll also take all opportunities to raise money at school, but we need your help. If you can, please donate money, gift cards, or equipment. We appreciate your consideration.

</div></div>","Critique of ""Rest in Power: The Trayvon Martin Story""
UPDATE: Debunking ""Rest in Power: Trayvon Martin Story"" (8/18/18)
Hey folks,
Just FYI, we've now distributed the detailed critique/debunking of the first three episodes of Jay Z's propaganda documentary, ""Rest in Power: The Trayvon Martin Story,"" in written PDF form (one report for each episode, current total about ~200 pages of typed content), video form and audio (MP3) form (roughly 3.5-4 hours of total content).
If you're already a contributor to our IndieGoGo to support this effort you'll have received emails from us with the necessary links to access/download this content. There are three more episodes to go, with Episode 4 airing on Monday, August 27, so figure final content will be about double what we've done so far.If you're NOT yet a contributor, you might just want to consider becoming one, because we've set a new ""stretch goal"" that if we reach will result in Attorney Don West himself sitting for an in-depth, in-person interview/discussion with yours truly about the case. Don's personally committed to this, if we hit our new stretch goal. (I've also spoken with George Zimmerman about doing something similar, details to follow.)
So, if you haven't yet become a contributor, or if you have but you have friends or family or social media contacts whom you haven't yet convinced to become contributors, now would be the time! It's just one click to support this effort!

Campaign Update: NEW STRETCH GOAL: Get DON WEST on board!
I talked with Don West today, who as you know was one of George Zimmerman's lawyers at his trial, and he's very much aware of this initiative, and is open to participating.  What we've tentatively explored is the two of us meeting up at a mutually convenient location, and essentially filming both of us discussing the trial in person--we could even do it as a live webinar, perhaps, so folks can ask questions in real time.
To make it worth the effort, however, we'd need to be able to cover the travel cost of us meeting up, filming and producing the video of the meeting, and so forth, plus I'd like to be able to offer Don a really exceptional single malt Scotch in appreciation for his contribution.
Accordingly, I'm setting another stretch goal, given that we're already not far from hitting our first stretch goal of $10,000--we're currently just under $7,000.  
If we hit $15,000 before the last episode of this ""crockumentary,"" I'll commit to convincing Don to meet up, have an extensive real-time discussion of the Zimmerman trial from each of our unique perspectives, and make that available at least as a live event and and an online stream.  That content would be made available for free to all contributors at the $30 level or above, and contributors below $30 would just need to bump up to $30 to be included.

<p>Hello. My Name is Timothy Elliot Lalowski. I am a 3rd year Architectural and Civil Engineering Student with a minor in Architecture at the Illinois Institute of Technology. This year, I became inspired to explore the field of Health as a supplementary area of study, and reached out to many organizations around the world looking for opportunities to receive in-field research.</p>
<p>I eventually teamed up with David Carpenter, the leader of the World Health Organization Collaborative Center in Environmental Health, the Institute of Health and the Environment at the University of Albany, as my mentor for my endeavors. Mr. David Carpenter (M.D.) has been overseeing my research and connecting me with professionals in the field around the world. However, UAlbany does not have funding to support any research or internships, so the burden of funding my endeavors has fallen on to me. </p>
<p>Some of the research on this topic can be accomplished through reading textual information from publications contained in library archives and Scholarly Journal Articles Databases such as JSTOR, however, nothing compares to an in-field experience, where real, pressing issues can be witnessed firsthand. For this reason, I am hoping to travel abroad to developing areas of the world such as the slums of India and the villages of Kenya to research detrimental Health issues that face the people who live there. </p>
<p>I would be conducting research alongside my peer at IIT in Chemical Engineering, Jefferson West, while volunteering with the Jane Adeny Memorial School. (This way, not only can I perform research, but I can also support the great ideals of this organization.) For more information on the Jane Adeny Memorial School, visit: <strong><a href=""http://www.janeadenymemorialschool.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.janeadenymemorialschool.com/</a> </strong></p>

<p><em><strong> </strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong> </strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Accesible Solutions to waste management issues in kenya</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>I. SUMMARY/ABSTRACT</strong></p>
<p>Kenya, like most developing regions of the world, suffers from a heightened risk of disease and infection from food and water supplies due to issues caused by the current waste management conditions. The objective of this project is to study aspects of common techniques for waste management and utilize the findings to propose an alternative solution to the issue.</p>
<p>The project is divided into five stages: identify extent of health hazards, identify current practices and past implementations, test current practices and past implementations for evaluation, design, and design testing. The first two stages are to be completed in the summer of 2013, the third stage is to be completed in the fall 2013-spring 2014 university year, and the final two stages are to be completed in the summer of 2014.</p>
<p>The researchers involved in the project are Timothy Lalowski and Jefferson West. Timothy Lalowski is a third year Architectural Engineering major at the Illinois Institute of Technology with additional studies in Civil Engineering and Architecture. Jefferson West is a third year Chemical Engineering major at the Illinois Institute of Technology with a minor in Business. Both students are in good academic standing.</p>
<p>The advising and evaluation roles of the project are to be undertaken by Dr. David O. Carpenter, director of the World Health Organization Collaborative Center for Environmental Health at the University of Albany Institute for Health and the Environment.</p>
<p><strong>II. NEED STATEMENT</strong></p>
<p>Rarely do developing regions receive aide which is accessible to the population at a point of time in the future. Equipment fails, buildings deteriorate, and systems are broken, without the resources necessary to repair or further develop what has been implemented. Often, time and money goes to waste, funding implementations that cannot be properly utilized due to the differing structure of society and variety of resources. This is caused by a misunderstanding of the needs and structure of the region. Developing regions need strategies of waste management based specifically on their cultural and regional needs, instead of implementing techniques developed for use in relief supplying countries.</p>
<p><strong>A. Description of specific problem targeted</strong></p>
<p>Waste management solutions in Kenya lack accessibility, and their implementation lacks reinforcement. As a result, the habitants of the region suffer from diseases and infections caused by the soil, air, water, and food contamination.</p>
<p><strong>B. Previous actions to deal with this need</strong></p>
<p>1.)    Community Composting Initiatives</p>
<p>2.)    Waste Collection NGOs and CBOs</p>
<p>3.)    Privatization of waste collection and disposal</p>
<p>4.)    Scavenging systems</p>
<p>5.)    Recycling Initiatives</p>
<p>6.)    Incineration Plants</p>
<p>7.)    Chemical Treatment Plants</p>
<p>8.)    National Environmental Management Authority (NEMA)</p>
<p>Few have provided a significant change in waste reduction or effective and safe disposal. The effective techniques are unable to keep up with the growing demands.</p>
<p><strong>C. Supportive data/information verifying the need</strong></p>
<p>Data Presented by the World Health Organization/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation attached, and can be found at the following URL: <a href=""http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/monitoring/africasan.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/monitoring/africasan.pdf</a></p>
<p><strong>D. Approach and benefit</strong></p>
<p>The approach of the project focuses on the accessibility of waste management solutions. Success of the project relies on the successful education and future accessibility of resources utilized in the proposed solutions.</p>
<p><strong>III. PLAN OF OPERATION</strong></p>
<p><strong>A. Project design</strong></p>
<p>Developing countries pose a uniquely high risk of disease from water and soil contamination. It is the objective of this project to first identify the extent of the health risk based on current conditions. Phases two and three aim to identify influences that either increase or decrease the level of health risk related to the current waste management conditions. The final two stages present an implementation to alleviate some of the risk associated with the current conditions of waste management in Nairobi, Kenya.</p>
<p><strong>B. Project structure</strong></p>
<p><strong>Goals</strong>: The primary goal of the project is to develop and test waste management solutions based on the observations and tests of previous unsuccessful implementations.</p>
<p><strong>Objectives</strong>:</p>
<p> Phase I: Identify Extent of Issues in Waste Management</p>
<p>     1. Test levels of soil contamination (chemical)</p>
<p>     2. Test levels of water contamination (chemical and pathogenic)</p>
<p>     3.Test levels of air pollution</p>
<p>     4. Gage waste production rates</p>
<p>     5. Gage recycling rates of waste reduction</p>
<p>     6. Gage composting rate of waste reduction and benefits</p>
<p>     7. Gage waste treatment rate of waste reduction and efficiency</p>
<p>     8. Gage water treatment rate and efficiency</p>
<p>Phase II: Identify Implementation Success and Failures</p>
<p>     1. Identify current waste management practices and past implementations</p>
<p>     2. Observe current waste management practices and past implementations</p>
<p>     3. Evaluate success and failure of current waste management practices and past implementations</p>
<p>     4. Isolate aspects of current waste management practices and past implementations</p>
<p>Phase III: Implementation Testing for Evaluation</p>
<ol>
<li>Design testing procedure of isolated aspects of current waste management practices and past implementations</li>
<li>Perform testing procedure of isolated aspects of current waste management practices and past implementations</li>
<li>Repeat testing procedure of isolated aspects of current waste management practices and past implementations</li>
<li>Evaluate tests on successes and failures of current waste management practices and past implementations</li>
</ol><p>Phase IV: Design</p>

Hello. My Name is Timothy Elliot Lalowski. I am a 3rd year Architectural and Civil Engineering Student with a minor in Architecture at the Illinois Institute of Technology. This year, I became inspired to explore the field of Health as a supplementary area of study, and reached out to many organizations around the world looking for opportunities to receive in-field research.
I eventually teamed up with David Carpenter, the leader of the World Health Organization Collaborative Center in Environmental Health, the Institute of Health and the Environment at the University of Albany, as my mentor for my endeavors. Mr. David Carpenter (M.D.) has been overseeing my research and connecting me with professionals in the field around the world. However, UAlbany does not have funding to support any research or internships, so the burden of funding my endeavors has fallen on to me. 
Some of the research on this topic can be accomplished through reading textual information from publications contained in library archives and Scholarly Journal Articles Databases such as JSTOR, however, nothing compares to an in-field experience, where real, pressing issues can be witnessed firsthand. For this reason, I am hoping to travel abroad to developing areas of the world such as the slums of India and the villages of Kenya to research detrimental Health issues that face the people who live there. 
I would be conducting research alongside my peer at IIT in Chemical Engineering, Jefferson West, while volunteering with the Jane Adeny Memorial School. (This way, not only can I perform research, but I can also support the great ideals of this organization.)

Accesible Solutions to waste management issues in kenya
I. SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Kenya, like most developing regions of the world, suffers from a heightened risk of disease and infection from food and water supplies due to issues caused by the current waste management conditions. The objective of this project is to study aspects of common techniques for waste management and utilize the findings to propose an alternative solution to the issue.
The project is divided into five stages: identify extent of health hazards, identify current practices and past implementations, test current practices and past implementations for evaluation, design, and design testing. The first two stages are to be completed in the summer of 2013, the third stage is to be completed in the fall 2013-spring 2014 university year, and the final two stages are to be completed in the summer of 2014.
The researchers involved in the project are Timothy Lalowski and Jefferson West. Timothy Lalowski is a third year Architectural Engineering major at the Illinois Institute of Technology with additional studies in Civil Engineering and Architecture. Jefferson West is a third year Chemical Engineering major at the Illinois Institute of Technology with a minor in Business. Both students are in good academic standing.
The advising and evaluation roles of the project are to be undertaken by Dr. David O. Carpenter, director of the World Health Organization Collaborative Center for Environmental Health at the University of Albany Institute for Health and the Environment.
II. NEED STATEMENT
Rarely do developing regions receive aide which is accessible to the population at a point of time in the future. Equipment fails, buildings deteriorate, and systems are broken, without the resources necessary to repair or further develop what has been implemented. Often, time and money goes to waste, funding implementations that cannot be properly utilized due to the differing structure of society and variety of resources. This is caused by a misunderstanding of the needs and structure of the region. Developing regions need strategies of waste management based specifically on their cultural and regional needs, instead of implementing techniques developed for use in relief supplying countries.
A. Description of specific problem targeted
Waste management solutions in Kenya lack accessibility, and their implementation lacks reinforcement. As a result, the habitants of the region suffer from diseases and infections caused by the soil, air, water, and food contamination.
B. Previous actions to deal with this need
1.)    Community Composting Initiatives
2.)    Waste Collection NGOs and CBOs
3.)    Privatization of waste collection and disposal
4.)    Scavenging systems
5.)    Recycling Initiatives
6.)    Incineration Plants
7.)    Chemical Treatment Plants
8.)    National Environmental Management Authority (NEMA)
Few have provided a significant change in waste reduction or effective and safe disposal. The effective techniques are unable to keep up with the growing demands.
C. Supportive data/information verifying the need
Data Presented by the World Health Organization/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation attached, and can be found at the following URL: http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/monitoring/africasan.pdf
D. Approach and benefit
The approach of the project focuses on the accessibility of waste management solutions. Success of the project relies on the successful education and future accessibility of resources utilized in the proposed solutions.
III. PLAN OF OPERATION
A. Project design
Developing countries pose a uniquely high risk of disease from water and soil contamination. It is the objective of this project to first identify the extent of the health risk based on current conditions. Phases two and three aim to identify influences that either increase or decrease the level of health risk related to the current waste management conditions. The final two stages present an implementation to alleviate some of the risk associated with the current conditions of waste management in Nairobi, Kenya.
B. Project structure
Goals: The primary goal of the project is to develop and test waste management solutions based on the observations and tests of previous unsuccessful implementations.
Objectives:
 Phase I: Identify Extent of Issues in Waste Management

     6. Gage composting rate of waste reduction and benefits
     7. Gage waste treatment rate of waste reduction and efficiency
     8. Gage water treatment rate and efficiency
Phase II: Identify Implementation Success and Failures
     1. Identify current waste management practices and past implementations
     2. Observe current waste management practices and past implementations
     3. Evaluate success and failure of current waste management practices and past implementations
     4. Isolate aspects of current waste management practices and past implementations

<p>I am drawn to this goal because it is managed by a local person who understands the needs and struggles of the community.

<p>The total cost for this trip is $1900 which includes program cost, building supplies, lodging, food, transportation within Haiti (Duchity is nearly a 7 hour drive from Port-au-Prince), and airfare.

name is Nasir Cook, I am 12 years old, I am in the 8th grade, and I live in Brooklyn, New
  York.  In
junior high school I have been a good student academically but never
I was never pushed really hard to be a great student in class.  I am also a budding fencer who is learning Epée
at The Peter Westbrook Foundation. My dream is to become a gold medalist in
fencing and a research doctor who will find a cure for cancer. Too many members
of my family and community have suffered the effects of this ravenous disease.  The wounds this disease leaves are not only on
the people battling the disease but also the ones that get left behind. I
believe a doctor's job is to heal and if I can help cure cancer then maybe I
can help prevent and heal some of the wounds cancer has left on us. </p>
<p>Being a part of the community has
made a huge impact on me and I want to further my education to do bigger and
better things.  To do this I need to attend a school that will push me beyond my comfort zone. I have been accepted
to my first choice school, Basis Independent Brooklyn. Even though I have been
awarded a partial scholarship, I still need to raise $20,000 to attend
this school year. </p>
<p>Overcoming barriers is a skill I
had to learn early in my life. Growing up in a single parent household in Brooklyn, I learned early on how to be resourceful by being
able to get what is needed.  I learned
that the world was unfair, but instead of crying and being upset with life, I
kept my thoughts positive and looked at the skills I was learning in these
experiences. I learned how to be responsible and also I learned how to stay
strong when dealing with adversities. But more than anything, I believed that I
shouldn’t let these negative situations distract me from wanting more for
myself. Going to Basis Independent Brooklyn means that I will obtain an
education that will continue to develop my mind and allow my in turn to transform
the lives in my community, not just locally but globally as well.</p>
<p>Right now my mother and I are doing

<br/></div>","My
name is Nasir Cook, I am 12 years old, I am in the 8th grade, and I live in Brooklyn, New
  York.  In
junior high school I have been a good student academically but never
I was never pushed really hard to be a great student in class.  I am also a budding fencer who is learning Epée
at The Peter Westbrook Foundation. My dream is to become a gold medalist in
fencing and a research doctor who will find a cure for cancer. Too many members
of my family and community have suffered the effects of this ravenous disease.  The wounds this disease leaves are not only on
the people battling the disease but also the ones that get left behind. I
believe a doctor's job is to heal and if I can help cure cancer then maybe I
can help prevent and heal some of the wounds cancer has left on us. 
Being a part of the community has
made a huge impact on me and I want to further my education to do bigger and
better things.  To do this I need to attend a school that will push me beyond my comfort zone. I have been accepted
to my first choice school, Basis Independent Brooklyn. Even though I have been
awarded a partial scholarship, I still need to raise $20,000 to attend
this school year. 
Overcoming barriers is a skill I
had to learn early in my life. Growing up in a single parent household in Brooklyn, I learned early on how to be resourceful by being
able to get what is needed.  I learned
that the world was unfair, but instead of crying and being upset with life, I
kept my thoughts positive and looked at the skills I was learning in these
experiences. I learned how to be responsible and also I learned how to stay
strong when dealing with adversities. But more than anything, I believed that I
shouldn’t let these negative situations distract me from wanting more for
myself. Going to Basis Independent Brooklyn means that I will obtain an
education that will continue to develop my mind and allow my in turn to transform
the lives in my community, not just locally but globally as well.
Right now my mother and I are doing
everything we can to get financial aid, yet it’s very difficult because my
mother is currently unemployed due to being laid off from a job she worked for the
past 7 years while out on disability.  Friends,
today I humbly ask you to dream with me.

Nonviolent Communication (NVC) is a way to build connections powerfully, compassionately,authentically, and with clarity. It builds capacity to express ourselves in language that doesn’t involve blame or attack and shows us how to listen to the underlying values or needs which are important to people even when they express themselves in difficult or hostile ways. NVC then builds on the new connections and understanding that arise to explore solutions and strategies that address everyone’s needs. Nonviolent Communication is being used in conflicts and settings worldwide by communities, institutions and organizations, activists, leaders, parents, educators, doctors, social workers, managers and others This program will bring together in the Mideast all sectors of people living in the region, as well to improve their work and home life and bring about the changes they want to see in the world.Other Ways You Can HelpPlease spread the word!

<h2>Why England?</h2>
<p>Since i was a wee lass, I wanted to move to England. Through years of work, careers, school (oh god so much school), I finally have the chance to go and pursue my dreams: To teach in London (or nearby) , England. With my Bachelor of Education in hand, I have been awarded a teaching position in England, however, I need to figure out how I can financially make the initial move from Canada.</p>
</div>
<h2>Where Does All The Money Go?</h2>
<p>Every dollar donated will go towards my expenses for the <strong>initial</strong> move to England. Such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>The flight to England</li>
<li>First and Last Month's Rent</li>
<li>Basic Furniture / Needs</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<div>
<h2>Why Beg For Money?</h2>
<p>I originally wanted to wait a year or two to save up enough money to move myself without any worries, but I recently discovered that England's immigration laws are extremely difficult to work with unless you are in your 20s. Since I am closing in on my 30s, I cannot risk this opportunity to achieve what I set out to do 15 years ago.</p>
<p>Any and all the people who donate to my dream chasing will always be dear to my heart. And through the years I will regail people with tales of those who have believed in helping dreams come true.</p>
<h2><span class=""font_8"">LGBTQ and Diversity</span></h2>
<p><span class=""font_8"">As a member of the LGBTQ community and being from a mixed race and mixed culture, I understand the issues and challenges that are faced. Changes in the world and acceptance sometimes are not enough to create a healthly environment for students who are constantly being marginalized or bullied based on thier race or sexuality. I have always believed that I have a duty to help and be able to provide advice or be a role model for students who need guidence... not only from someone who is an ally, but from someone who is a member.</span></p>
<h2>Philosophy of Education</h2>
<p>Your donation will not only help me, but will intrinsically make an impact on every student I teach. Below is my philosophy of education, something I hold dear to my heart and will always believe in.</p>
<p><span class=""font_8"">Teaching isn't simply a transfer of knowledge from one person to another; it is an opportunity to change lives and help mould futures. Education has changed drastically over the past few decades, changing from a knowledge based approach to a critical thinking approach. With online access to a plethora of information, we are no longer filling minds with raw information, but rather showing students how to interpret, understand, and critically analyze information and how to find relevant knowledge. I strongly feel that our students are now on the cusp of a new era of learning and teachers need to embrace the new digital society to be able to give students an education that they can relate to. Using technology, social media and other types of relevant media, I will strengthen my lessons by making them relevant and interactive with students – keeping them engaged and enthusiastic about learning.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span class=""font_8"">Teachers are role models whether or not they intend to be and the way teachers look at life and career is important. A smile, sharing a good joke with the students, or even just taking ten minutes in the morning with a class to talk informally to see how their weekend went, can create a more approachable teacher without breaking professionalism. Like any other job, one of the most important qualities to have in a leader is approachability—that if anyone is having difficulties they will be able to talk to you and be able to work out a solution.</span></p>
<p><span class=""font_8""><br/>Teaching is more than just fulfilling the curriculum; it is getting to know students, and helping them when they need guidance. Teaching is being able to show students who want to give up to keep going and to give students a place to feel welcome when they feel like they don’t belong. School should be fun and engaging and they should not be subject to a torturous like environment. School should be like a second home where they can have fun, collaborate and socialize with one another while investigating new information. Students should be free to be creative with their lessons and never feel the fear of being judged if they try something new, or attempt a solution to a question. A great teacher once said, “Take chances, make mistakes, and get messy!”</span></p>

<p>My name is Rosemary White and I am the ED of an <em>inclusive</em> preschool program here in Toronto. Bond Child and Family Development. (formerly Bond Street Nursery School) This wonderful nursery school was founded in 1937 to help children and families whose lives were ravaged by the Great Depression and then by the war. Families without enough food or clothing and certainly, no toys. Sadly, in 2013, there continues to be poverty and great need in our community and Bond continues to find housing, clothing, food and toys for many children.</p>
<p>25% of the children in our program have special needs. One in every 88 children in Canada is diagnosed with Autism. Our school supports many children with autism. Children needing help with speech and language skills and physical development are here too.</p>
<p> As the mother of a child with special needs, De George Syndrome, I am passionate about inclusion. I fought many battles to have my daughter be a part of the normal world in schools, camps, and in life. My daughter passed away and now my fight continues for other children.</p>
<p> We have been asked many times to include children who are unable to walk because of medical fragility. We have not had the equipment or staffing to support children safely. That is about to change. With your donation, we can buy some very useful things. Every child should be able to participate in every part of our program but sometimes they need a little extra help.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p><em>We are raising two thousand dollars to buy two things: a special back support tricycle and a small support chair to help a three year-old girl with Cerebral Palsy and a four year-old boy recovering from brain cancer. Neither can walk…yet.</em></p>
<p>We have a very large beautiful outdoor playground and garden where kids ride their bikes on a meandering path through the trees and around the garden. There are child-sized picnic tables and benches. The new trike and chair will allow the two children (and who knows how many more later), to do what all the other children are doing.</p>
<p> Your support will be applauded and acknowledged on our website and in our newsletters. You will know, especially if you have friends or family with special needs, that your dollars have been put to very good use.</p>
<h2>If you do not use Pay Pal and want a receipt for tax purposes, send a cheque to:</h2>

<h2>If you have already donated through Pay Pal, and would like a receipt, send me your address at <a href=""mailto:bsns@bellnet.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">bsns@bellnet.ca</a>
</h2>
<p>Even if we only raise a few hundred dollars, it will be enough to buy the chair so a child could sit up to the craft or snack table without falling.</p>
<p> <strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Children that come to Bond get a terrific start. By ages 4 and 5 they are ready for kindergarten. Each, to the best of his or her ability has learned English, made friends, and can count, recognize colours, sing, dance and play. Oh, and take turns. That is so important.</p>
<p>Our program is a United Way member agency with a proven track record of success in our community. We have helped thousands of children throughout the years.

<h3>Monica, a friend of mine, wants to go to Our Lady Seat of Wisdom Academy (<a href=""http://seatofwisdom.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://seatofwisdom.org/</a>) this fall. Unfortunately this school does not take student loans, so Monica is trying to raise the money on her own.</h3>
<h3>I have been friends with Monica for over four years and I've seen what a beautiful, generous young woman she is. She always has a smile on her face and a kind word for someone. I'm hoping to raise half the total for her. As her youth leader and as her friend I have seen her grow in her faith over the last few year and <span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">I would love for her to have this opportunity to further that growth at a Catholic institution. </span>
</h3>
<p>Right now Monica is working full time while finishing up Grade 12 to fund her tuition and ticket to Ontario, where the school is located. </p>
<p>The total costs, as taken from the School's website are as follows:</p>
<p><strong><span>TUITION </span></strong><br/>$5,950 + $200 CAD Student Activity Fee (2012-2013)</p>
<div><strong><span>ROOM AND BOARD</span></strong></div>
<div>$5,000 CAD</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So a total of $11,150 + the cost of a plane ticket to Ontario. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>In the campaign I'm hoping to raise 5,500, so about half of the overall cost. Even if this goal is not met, every little bit helps Monica! </div>
</div>
<div>
<h3>If you contribute....</h3>
<ul>
<li>You're helping a wonderful young woman grow in her Catholic faith. :)</li>
<li>I will pray for your personal intentions every day that Monica is at school. </li>

<p><br/></p> <p>My little 13 inch macbook is not powerful enough to get the development done very well. And it is on its last legs. I need a new macintosh to move my development environment and code to. Aside from that it's not possible to support wife and daughter without a full time job and with a full time job you just dont get any free time to work on side projects. What I want to do is get some help from the indiegogo community to allow me to take six to eight months off work and devote to this project that I think will protect the intellectual property of hundreds of thousands of developers around the globe.</p>
<p>While I will be purchasing a new macintosh, this money will also help support me and my family as I become a one man development wrecking crew on this project. I know I can produce this, I want to produce this. I just need a little freedom from the daily grind.</p>
<p>If I get enough donations, I will look into hiring other like minded individuals with some incredible development skills (I already know a few) who can help me accomplish this task.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>

After that I worked on understanding all kinds of scripting languages such as VBScript and Javascript. I have also worked on open source server development using PHP and MySql. More importantly tho, I have held many positions in companies working on languages ranging from Java/C# to Objective C and even Oracle's PL/SQL or microsoft's T-SQL. I have worked on nearly all databases including but not limited to MySql, Oracle, MSSQL and even FoxPro.

And that is why I know this is well within my reach. I was already able to rename class names, and I have been working on getting other features working as my money slowly dwindles. The project just needs to be expanded on and turned into a nice robust framework that would make all my mentors proud.

<div> <p></p>The CYCLE Kids program is unique because a child's learning is both experiential and academic. During the program, each child receives a textbook to support concepts learned in their physical education class. </div>
<div>This year, CYCLE Kids is revamping, and redesigning our curriculum. We have strengthened the nutritional concepts and added activities that emphasizes cooperative learning, using auditory, kinesthetic, and visual learning techniques. </div>
<div>CYCLE Kids needs to raise $65,000 to complete our new curriculum. With the support of our partner, Kick Design, our new content is almost ready to go. We need your help to finish production and to distribute it to the schools.</div>

<p>In the CYCLE Kids program, students learn about nutrition, they learn how to ride a bike safely, they get exercise, and most importantly, they get that same feeling you had when you realized that Dad had already let go and you were riding on your own.</p>
<p>With research funded by the American Heart Association and conducted in collaboration with  the nutrition department at Boston University's Sargent College for Health and Rehabilitation Sciences, a program was developed that taps into the joy of the biking experience. Children achieve personal and social growth, desire higher levels of physical activity, and gain much needed nutrition knowledge.<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></p>

<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b><b><b><b><b><b><b><b><b><b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Personal growth –  </b>students feel safe and self-reliant, improving their self-confidence, self-esteem, and sense of well-being.</li>
<li>
<b>Social growth – </b>kids have an opportunity to socialize with other children in a positive, social, and non-competitive physical activity.</li>
<li>
<b>Physical activity – </b>By making bike-riding fun, social, and safe, CYCLE Kids gets children hooked on a healthy activity.</li>
<li>
<b>Nutrition knowledge – </b> CYCLE Kids graduates adopt new nutritional skills, including portion control, how to fuel your body for energy, and the importance of fruits and vegetables.</li>

</div></div>","Our educational enrichment program gives kids needed skills to lead healthy active lives, and a foundation from which to go on to be successful adults.
The goal of our Indigogo campaign is to raise the money we need to produce our new curriculum and distribute it to the 3,000 CYCLE Kids students in our program each year. 


 

MissionThe CYCLE Kids program inspires healthy lifestyle choices.  Kids are introduced to the joy of bicycling and educated about bike safety and nutrition.  We empower children to develop positive, safe and active lifelong habits, achieve academic success, and improve their social skills. 
AboutCYCLE Kids is a national organization with 39 programs in eight states, reaching 3,000 children each year.  Since 2004, CYCLE Kids has engaged children in physical activity to address the health and emotional issues facing today's under-active often overweight, children.  Built on the belief that the vital, simple, and captivating skill of riding a bike changes lives, CYCLE Kids is dedicated to improving the health and well-being of children through a comprehensive curriculum that teaches not just the skill of cycling, but nutrition too.  The program fosters monitorship, builds community, and gives kids and families empowering skills and lessons that endure a lifetime.




What We Need 
 The CYCLE Kids program is unique because a child's learning is both experiential and academic. During the program, each child receives a textbook to support concepts learned in their physical education class. 
This year, CYCLE Kids is revamping, and redesigning our curriculum. We have strengthened the nutritional concepts and added activities that emphasizes cooperative learning, using auditory, kinesthetic, and visual learning techniques. 
CYCLE Kids needs to raise $65,000 to complete our new curriculum. With the support of our partner, Kick Design, our new content is almost ready to go. We need your help to finish production and to distribute it to the schools.

Funds raised for this project will be used to complete the following:

Layout Design
Illustration
Printing
Training
Distribution



    


The Impact
In the CYCLE Kids program, students learn about nutrition, they learn how to ride a bike safely, they get exercise, and most importantly, they get that same feeling you had when you realized that Dad had already let go and you were riding on your own.
With research funded by the American Heart Association and conducted in collaboration with  the nutrition department at Boston University's Sargent College for Health and Rehabilitation Sciences, a program was developed that taps into the joy of the biking experience. Children achieve personal and social growth, desire higher levels of physical activity, and gain much needed nutrition knowledge.





Personal growth –  students feel safe and self-reliant, improving their self-confidence, self-esteem, and sense of well-being.

Social growth – kids have an opportunity to socialize with other children in a positive, social, and non-competitive physical activity.

Physical activity – By making bike-riding fun, social, and safe, CYCLE Kids gets children hooked on a healthy activity.

Nutrition knowledge –  CYCLE Kids graduates adopt new nutritional skills, including portion control, how to fuel your body for energy, and the importance of fruits and vegetables.





Take away? Kids start to bike to school, focus better on their academics, make new friends, and influence their families to change and adopt healthier habits.
The CYCLE Kids program fosters mentorships, builds community, and empowers kids.  The program brings hope and strength to communities: the hope for a brighter future for their children and the strength to unite and become agents of change.

Our Research

 Where there is knowledge there is power.  Over the past 5 years, we have been educating ourselves on how to create the greatest impact through our program.
How? CYCLE Kids measures program impact with pre and post program assessments that determine a child's gain in knowledge in the areas of riding skills and enthusiasm, road safety, and nutrition.
Why? Results from these assessments show us how to reach further into the community and inspire children to adopt the skills from a CYCLE Kids class and integrate them into everyday life.
Next Steps: The new 2- year curriculum will


Strengthen children's existing knowledge of nutrition
Encourage parental involvement and inspire healthy eating for the whole family
Emphasize cooperative learning
Address all types of learning styles

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Reserva Playa Tortuga (RPT) is a non-governmental, non-profit organization in Costa Rica. RPT aims to contribute to the fields of biological research and science based conservation management as well as fomenting a culture of environmental conservation in the areas influenced by the National Wetlands of the Térraba-Sierpe basin. It is a rather young reserve, launched in 2009, which initially focused on the conservation of endangered marine turtles on its beach, Playa Tortuga. During the past years the reserve has grown and elaborated its activities to include water quality testing, mammals and birds inventories, sustainable fishing promotion and otter research. Although research is of great importance to our reserve, we believe that it is equally important to translate our research findings, implementing them with real world projects within the communities around the Reserve. A synergy of research and conservation education is what we are aiming for.</p>
<p>RPT is currently developing a pilot environmental education program in the 6th Grande de Térraba circuit of the Osa Canton, which includes 18 schools and about 1100 students. The core of the program is to promote, teach and disseminate relevant biological conservation research information and good practices for the sustainable use of natural resources, as a responsibility of the Osa community. The program seeks to educate, activate and empower locals, regarding the environmental rights and responsibilities of the school children. The programs focus is on the level of the students, using a wholistic approach reaches out to include their families and the community at large. Based on the ‘teach the teacher’ concept, we also train the teachers to use the educational materials, concepts and pedagogical techniques, so they can gradually work more and more independently each academic year. To train these teachers we need to hire an environmental educator. <strong>Human resources are at this time the key-factor to make this program happen.</strong></p>
<p>By supporting our project, you will be able to educate a whole community in Costa Rica, but at the same time, you will be creating new jobs for the local people.</p>

Reserva Playa Tortuga (RPT) is a non-governmental, non-profit organization in Costa Rica. RPT aims to contribute to the fields of biological research and science based conservation management as well as fomenting a culture of environmental conservation in the areas influenced by the National Wetlands of the Térraba-Sierpe basin. It is a rather young reserve, launched in 2009, which initially focused on the conservation of endangered marine turtles on its beach, Playa Tortuga. During the past years the reserve has grown and elaborated its activities to include water quality testing, mammals and birds inventories, sustainable fishing promotion and otter research. Although research is of great importance to our reserve, we believe that it is equally important to translate our research findings, implementing them with real world projects within the communities around the Reserve. A synergy of research and conservation education is what we are aiming for.
RPT is currently developing a pilot environmental education program in the 6th Grande de Térraba circuit of the Osa Canton, which includes 18 schools and about 1100 students. The core of the program is to promote, teach and disseminate relevant biological conservation research information and good practices for the sustainable use of natural resources, as a responsibility of the Osa community.

<h3>Who Are We?</h3>
<p>Georgia grew up on an organic farm in north North Dakota where she learned the value of hard work and the sacredness of life. Their family raises small grain, alfalfa for hay, and beef cattle they sell directly to local customers. She has wanted to work against trafficking and forced prostitution for quite some time, and throughout college had the chance to volunteer with a Minneapolis non-profit, Source MN, who was starting a transitional home for women coming out of that life. For 7 months after graduating college Georgia interned with Source and lived as a mentor in their transitional home model. She's been working toward opening a transitional home and school for young women, especially those under 18, that will be located on her family farm for some time, and college and interning were key steps in the process. She's also stepping into managing the farm and is substitute teaching around the farming schedule. While she's working toward the long term goal, she also wants to do something now to raise awareness and funding. <br/></p>
<p>Jenn is a hiking and adventure guide in the Boundary Waters of northern Minnesota, a nursing assitant, rock climber, and outdoor enthusiast. She brings a host of expertise in camping and survival methods to this trip and a love for adventure. Jenn first realized the link between campers she led in Boundary Waters trips and transitional women coming out of prostitution and trafficking situations when her campers loved nature and didn't want to go back to their inner city lives at the end of the week. After several years of relationships and seeing patterns, she knew that these experiences were a fun relief for kids in bad home situations but she needed to do more to help keep young girls out of prostitution and trafficking. She got involved in Source's community outreach events and at the transitional home where she heard about this awareness bike trip. Being in love with adventure and expert on camping, Jenn saw this as a great way to get involved with awareness while doing what she loves. <br/></p>
<p>We believe that every person, male or female, must be treated with the dignity and respect of being human. Slavery strips that away. With more slaves in the world now than at any other time in history, and the United States having more slaves than any other country, we need to end slavery and rescue women. 1 in 3 women are sexually abused by the time they turn 18, and 98% of women in sexual slavery have been sexually abused before their enslavement. We all know more than 3 women. Likely, we've all had contact with someone in slavery and didn't even know it. We are riding for the 2 million girls and women enslaved today who can't speak out or aren't heard because of the circumstances beyond their control. We believe that if more people were aware of slavery, trafficking, and forced prostitution and the faces these crimes take, that more women would be rescued and rehabilitated for a healthier future. <br/></p>
<p>If only one woman gained freedom from our riding 3100 miles in 2 months, we'd do it, but we believe many more will get the help they so desperately want. Most importantly, we believe that if we proclaim to have faith and know our loving God, we need to give our lives to acting in that faith and by that love. In faith we know we'll finish the trip strong and make a difference. In love for God, enslaved people, and each person we meet we look forward to bringing awareness and love to the folks who support our mission and whose paths we cross on our trip. </p>
<p>Our route will take us along I-10 from San Diego, CA to Phoenix, AZ, El Paso and Austin, TX, Poplarville and Hattiesburg, MS, Mobile, AL, Pensacola, Tallahassee, and Gainesville, FL and end in St. Augustine, FL. That's over 3000 miles in 7 or 8 weeks. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We want to raise $5,500 through this campaign for the trip, which benefits the Annex Network, a daughter program of Source MN in Minneapolis. They have a transitional home with three beds in one apartment for transitional women sandwiched between two apartments with mentor volunteers. The volunteers are all young women 20-35 years old who provide mentoring in spiritual, physical, and social care/skills and are like big sisters to transitional women. The program is not only a transitional home. As the Annex Network serves their transitional women, they are also mentoring other groups in starting their own transitional homes. The vision is to have many small homes across the midwest to support life changing growth in a small family setting for women coming out of trafficking and sexual slavery. Funds will be used to have a full time social worker who will serve several homes and expenses associated with mentoring and starting transitional homes such as travel expense, program start up in individual transitional homes, and moving women into their new home and family. This also includes groceries, school supplies for those finishing high school and college, and events such as art nights or camping that center on healing and therapy for women involved. </p>
<p>From donating, you will know that you have helped free enslaved people and educated hundreds of people about modern underground slavery. You can also receive updates on Source's work by emailing them at sourcemn.org and asking to get on their update list, which includes Annex Network updates. That's on top of the souvenirs you receive from donating. For donating $15, we'll send you a post card from a town we're staying in during our ride and let you know how the day went. If you can donate $30, you'll receive a piece of handmade jewelry donated by someone who supports this cause. It could be a set of beaded earrings, a clay bracelet, or a number of other items. We'll make the selection, but we're sure you'll be happy with your piece! For a $100 donation you can get a clay bracelet hand made by a close friend and co-intern from Source who couldn't ride but wants to do anything else she can. We'll also send you two post cards from different stops on our trip with the adventure of the day. One $1000 donation will receive a signed hostbook from the trip. We'll ask every host we stay with and each host of places we speak along the route to sign the notebook and we'll send it to you when we've finished in March 2014. <br/></p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>There are other ways you can help if finances are too tight. If you have experienced prayer working, please pray for us! We strongly believe that when we ask in faith with the right intentions, God answers. Please pray for strength, safety, effectiveness, and being able to love each and every person as much as they should be loved. <br/><br/>You can also help by getting the word out. Share this link on all the social networking sites and let us know if you know someone along the route that would like us to stay with them overnight or speak at their church, school, small group, coffee meeting, business, etc. For a complete route and list of nightly stops, please contact me through the blog and website at <a href=""http://faithinactionblog.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://faithinactionblog.org/</a>.<br/></span></span></span></span></span></div>","Who Are We?

<p><b>Our Story</b><br/></p>
<p>New Community Youth Development Corporation (YDC) will start a take away cafe (and later an eat in cafe) at 1516 20th Street West (the former site of our Pleasant Hill bakery). The cafe will achieve a number of community goals in self sustaining fashion.  The cafe will be partially run by our students and will provide instruction in commercial cooking and provide sheltered employment.  The 20th street corridor has rapidly gentrified and the commercial area has rapidly become unaffordable for local residents.  The cafe will offer several daily lunch specials all priced between $4-6/each.  At least one of these will be Diabetic Friendly.<br/></p>
<p>The cafe will be a natural extension of the bakery business that we already operate.  This will allow us limited risk in the start up phase and significantly reduce operational costs. This will significantly increase the opportunity for success from a financial and program point of view.  The facility already has a public health license and has all zoning and approval.<br/></p>
<p>The money through crowdfunding and additional fundraising will allow us to complete the required renovation to have people eat in, purchase equipment necessary for growth, and for promotion and branding.<br/></p>
<p><b>About Us</b></p>
<p>YDC is a unique 
organization.  We are an accredited school, social enterprise, a 
non-profit, and a sheltered workplace.  This unique combination of 
attributes allows us to work with and succeed with some of the most 
highly at risk young people in our society.<br/><br/>At our core, we are a
 school; we strive to provide an education to those that have no other 
remaining options.  We are an independent high school, aligned with 
neither the public or separate school boards. We are small with an 
anticipated enrollment of just 25-30 students in 2015-2016 ; we are 
fully accredited and offer a full high school program.  This past year, 
we had our first graduating class. It is highly unlikely that these 
students would have ever graduated somewhere else.  We offer students an
 effective mix of academic subjects, practical subjects and concurrent 
sheltered employment.  The businesses that we run were generated as a 
natural expense of our curricular offerings.<br/></p>
<p><b>Community Learner's High School – Saskatoon's Newest and Most Innovative High School</b><br/> <br/>As the old adage goes, teach someone to fish and you feed them for a lifetime. Our school teaches our students skills to live a better life and build better families and communities.  They go to school but also learn cooking, mechanics, screen printing, carpentry and so on.</p>Community Learner's High School is unique in the province.  It provides provincially accredited academic programs, employment skill training and part time work.  We have operated in Saskatoon for seven years.  We know that our work changes lives!<br/><p><br/><b>Cooking up a Better Future, Feeding our Community.</b><br/>We're going to expand our commercial cooking program to create a sit down community cafe!  Community Learner's High School has operated Nestor's Community Bakery for five years in Saskatoon.  Countless young people have received their first job and a better start in their work/career as a result of Nestor's training program.  In April 2015, CLHS purchased Pleasant Hill Bakery.  The bakery has been converted into a school and a student run cafeteria.  The cafeteria serves an affordable lunch of just $5.00 to anyone. Our cafeteria teaches real skills and helps young people prepare for a better future.  We will expand the cafeteria to include a full restaurant and cafe.  Our students will work with professional chefs and commercial cooking teachers in the restaurant to prepare them for other jobs in the service industry.  <br/></p>

<b>Change is not Cheap. Nor is Equipment and Renovation.</b><br/>We need your help! Whether it is $2.00 or $500.00.  The money raised in this campaign will allow us to buy equipment, perform necessary renovations, and other necessary changes to allow us to expand our cafe to meet its goals of educating our students and feeding the community.<br/>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p><b>Tell a Friend.  Tell the World!  Help us! </b><br/>Money isn't everything, but it can change our little piece of the world.  Tell a friend. Share on Facebook or twitter. Take a friend for a coffee and a donut.  Every dollar is just as important because every dollar counts.<br/><br/>What's 20 feet long, covered in icing, and can change the world?  The world's longest donut, of course!  <br/><br/>As part of our campaign, we are making the world's longest donut.  Our record attempt is registered with the Guinness Book of World records.  We will be attempting to make a donut 20 feet long.  You can come see the donut made.  Buy donuts for your office, friends or school.  An exclusive perk is to be an offical chef for the event.  Your name will be forever associated with the Guinness Book of World Records!<br/><br/><b>Donut Wall of Fame!</b><br/>For every contribution, we will place a brightly coloured donut cut out with your name in our window.  Help us fill our windows.  Watch us post updates on facebook as the windows fill up.</p>
<p><b>Impact<b><br/></b></b></p>
<ul>
<li>Increased training position in school- We anticipate that this will create  eight training positions in year one and 12 in years two and three.</li>
<li>Increase in the number sheltered work placements -The Cafe will create approximately four part time jobs in year one and six to eight in year two.</li>
<li>Increase revenue to support school and other social beneficial activities – Although it is hard to budget at this point, we are hoping that the cafe will over time generate profits that can assist the operation of our school.  We are paid 50% of the provincial funding average per student.  Our students are very need intensive and our program is not inexpensive. Our students,  unlike the students at other private schools, can not afford to pay tuition.  As such, the profits from our social enterprises are key to us being able to offer a quality educational program to our students and meet their diverse needs.</li>

</div><br/></div>","Our Story
New Community Youth Development Corporation (YDC) will start a take away cafe (and later an eat in cafe) at 1516 20th Street West (the former site of our Pleasant Hill bakery). The cafe will achieve a number of community goals in self sustaining fashion.  The cafe will be partially run by our students and will provide instruction in commercial cooking and provide sheltered employment.  The 20th street corridor has rapidly gentrified and the commercial area has rapidly become unaffordable for local residents.  The cafe will offer several daily lunch specials all priced between $4-6/each.  At least one of these will be Diabetic Friendly.
The cafe will be a natural extension of the bakery business that we already operate.  This will allow us limited risk in the start up phase and significantly reduce operational costs. This will significantly increase the opportunity for success from a financial and program point of view.  The facility already has a public health license and has all zoning and approval.
The money through crowdfunding and additional fundraising will allow us to complete the required renovation to have people eat in, purchase equipment necessary for growth, and for promotion and branding.
About Us
YDC is a unique 
organization.  We are an accredited school, social enterprise, a 
non-profit, and a sheltered workplace.  This unique combination of 
attributes allows us to work with and succeed with some of the most 
highly at risk young people in our society.At our core, we are a
 school; we strive to provide an education to those that have no other 
remaining options.  We are an independent high school, aligned with 
neither the public or separate school boards. We are small with an 
anticipated enrollment of just 25-30 students in 2015-2016 ; we are 
fully accredited and offer a full high school program.  This past year, 
we had our first graduating class. It is highly unlikely that these 
students would have ever graduated somewhere else.  We offer students an
 effective mix of academic subjects, practical subjects and concurrent 
sheltered employment.  The businesses that we run were generated as a 
natural expense of our curricular offerings.
Community Learner's High School – Saskatoon's Newest and Most Innovative High School As the old adage goes, teach someone to fish and you feed them for a lifetime. Our school teaches our students skills to live a better life and build better families and communities.  They go to school but also learn cooking, mechanics, screen printing, carpentry and so on.Community Learner's High School is unique in the province.  It provides provincially accredited academic programs, employment skill training and part time work.  We have operated in Saskatoon for seven years.  We know that our work changes lives!Cooking up a Better Future, Feeding our Community.We're going to expand our commercial cooking program to create a sit down community cafe!  Community Learner's High School has operated Nestor's Community Bakery for five years in Saskatoon.  Countless young people have received their first job and a better start in their work/career as a result of Nestor's training program.  In April 2015, CLHS purchased Pleasant Hill Bakery.  The bakery has been converted into a school and a student run cafeteria.  The cafeteria serves an affordable lunch of just $5.00 to anyone. Our cafeteria teaches real skills and helps young people prepare for a better future.  We will expand the cafeteria to include a full restaurant and cafe.  Our students will work with professional chefs and commercial cooking teachers in the restaurant to prepare them for other jobs in the service industry.  



Change is not Cheap. Nor is Equipment and Renovation.We need your help! Whether it is $2.00 or $500.00.  The money raised in this campaign will allow us to buy equipment, perform necessary renovations, and other necessary changes to allow us to expand our cafe to meet its goals of educating our students and feeding the community.
 
Tell a Friend.  Tell the World!  Help us! Money isn't everything, but it can change our little piece of the world.  Tell a friend. Share on Facebook or twitter. Take a friend for a coffee and a donut.  Every dollar is just as important because every dollar counts.What's 20 feet long, covered in icing, and can change the world?  The world's longest donut, of course!  As part of our campaign, we are making the world's longest donut.  Our record attempt is registered with the Guinness Book of World records.  We will be attempting to make a donut 20 feet long.  You can come see the donut made.  Buy donuts for your office, friends or school.  An exclusive perk is to be an offical chef for the event.  Your name will be forever associated with the Guinness Book of World Records!Donut Wall of Fame!For every contribution, we will place a brightly coloured donut cut out with your name in our window.  Help us fill our windows.  Watch us post updates on facebook as the windows fill up.
Impact

Increased training position in school- We anticipate that this will create  eight training positions in year one and 12 in years two and three.
Increase in the number sheltered work placements -The Cafe will create approximately four part time jobs in year one and six to eight in year two.
Increase revenue to support school and other social beneficial activities – Although it is hard to budget at this point, we are hoping that the cafe will over time generate profits that can assist the operation of our school.  We are paid 50% of the provincial funding average per student.  Our students are very need intensive and our program is not inexpensive. Our students,  unlike the students at other private schools, can not afford to pay tuition.  As such, the profits from our social enterprises are key to us being able to offer a quality educational program to our students and meet their diverse needs.

<h3><strong>The Rose International Fund for Children (TRIFC)</strong></h3>
<h3><strong><em>“Fostering Hope, Compassion and Opportunity for Individuals with Disability in Nepal”</em></strong></h3>
<h2><strong>From Students with Blindness in Nepal:</strong></h2>
<p>Help us read books with pictures, maps and diagrams.  Here in Nepal, we people with blindness face many obstacles to having a quality life. Not only do we face discrimination since our blindness is considered a sin from a past life, not only are we limited in our ability to be successful in school due to the lack of school supplies, Braille paper and resource teachers, but the only Braille books available are text only without any tactile pictures.  How can I learn about the world without being able to touch a map?  How can I learn geometry without diagrams that I can feel? How can I learn biology without Braille embossed pictures as examples? How can I keep up with my sighted peers in classes?  We all know that education creates an opportunity for a better life.  NAWB (Nepal Association for the Welfare of the Blind) provides textbooks for us throughout the country of Nepal and they are in need of a Braille embosser/printer to create books with maps, diagrams and photos that we can touch and feel!   Please help us raise the remaining $8,500 needed to purchase the printer to print the books we so desperately need to be successful in our schooling.  With many thanks from all the students with blindness in Nepal.  Namaste! </p>
<h3>What is TRIFC's mission and vision?</h3>
<p><em>The Rose International Fund for Children (TRIFC)</em> is a US Government registered 501(c)3 non-profit organization.  The primary mission of <em>TRIFC</em> is to improve the lives of children in Nepal, particularly those who have a disability.  We raise awareness of these children’s conditions by documenting and publicizing our work.  We raise funds to support qualifying non-profit organizations in Nepal.  Through our projects, we seek to create disability awareness, uplift the lives of people with disabilities and contribute to meaningful long-term social change for generations to come. TRIFC is a non-profit organization that believes in the value of sharing resources with those less fortunate. </p>
<p>TRIFC is a nonsectarian and nonpartisan organization that provides help solely because the need exists, with no expectation of any benefit coming in return.</p>
<h3>What we need:</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Thanks to substantial funding from local Rotary Clubs ($12,000), we only need $8,500 of the $20,500 price tag for a Tiger brand Braille Embosser/Printer.  By funding this project we will be providing every single Blind/Visually-Impaired (BVI) student in the ENTIRE country of Nepal with textbooks containing tactile pictures and graphics.</p>
<ul>
<li>Total cost includes shipping costs to Nepal</li>
<li>Funding will be wired by TRIFC to the Rotary Club of Kasthamandap in Kathmandu, Nepal</li>
<li>Project oversight will be provided by the Rotary Club of Kasthamandap</li>
<li>The Braille Embosser/Printer will be operated and maintained by the Nepal Association of the Welfare of the Blind (NAWB). <strong>Nepal Association for the Welfare of the Blind (NAWB)</strong> established in 1985 is a National level non-profit created for the rehabilitation of the persons with blindness and visual impairment (PBVI). It is non-governmental, non-profit, non-sectarian and non-poilitical organisation (<a href=""http://www.nawbnepal.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.nawbnepal.org</a>).</li>
<li>TRIFC will provide any remaining funds needed to complete this campaign.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Impact:</h3>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>TRIFC has been providing help, hope and love to children and adults with disabilities in Nepal since 2006</li>
<li>We provide children and adults with disabilities with surgeries and prosthetics, nutrional support, school supplies, educational sponsorships and much more!</li>

How can I keep up with my sighted peers in classes?  We all know that education creates an opportunity for a better life.  NAWB (Nepal Association for the Welfare of the Blind) provides textbooks for us throughout the country of Nepal and they are in need of a Braille embosser/printer to create books with maps, diagrams and photos that we can touch and feel!   Please help us raise the remaining $8,500 needed to purchase the printer to print the books we so desperately need to be successful in our schooling.  With many thanks from all the students with blindness in Nepal.  Namaste! 
What is TRIFC's mission and vision?
The Rose International Fund for Children (TRIFC) is a US Government registered 501(c)3 non-profit organization.  The primary mission of TRIFC is to improve the lives of children in Nepal, particularly those who have a disability.  We raise awareness of these children’s conditions by documenting and publicizing our work.  We raise funds to support qualifying non-profit organizations in Nepal.  Through our projects, we seek to create disability awareness, uplift the lives of people with disabilities and contribute to meaningful long-term social change for generations to come. TRIFC is a non-profit organization that believes in the value of sharing resources with those less fortunate. 
TRIFC is a nonsectarian and nonpartisan organization that provides help solely because the need exists, with no expectation of any benefit coming in return.
What we need:


Thanks to substantial funding from local Rotary Clubs ($12,000), we only need $8,500 of the $20,500 price tag for a Tiger brand Braille Embosser/Printer.  By funding this project we will be providing every single Blind/Visually-Impaired (BVI) student in the ENTIRE country of Nepal with textbooks containing tactile pictures and graphics.

Total cost includes shipping costs to Nepal
Funding will be wired by TRIFC to the Rotary Club of Kasthamandap in Kathmandu, Nepal
Project oversight will be provided by the Rotary Club of Kasthamandap
The Braille Embosser/Printer will be operated and maintained by the Nepal Association of the Welfare of the Blind (NAWB). Nepal Association for the Welfare of the Blind (NAWB) established in 1985 is a National level non-profit created for the rehabilitation of the persons with blindness and visual impairment (PBVI). It is non-governmental, non-profit, non-sectarian and non-poilitical organisation (www.nawbnepal.org).
TRIFC will provide any remaining funds needed to complete this campaign.

Impact:



TRIFC has been providing help, hope and love to children and adults with disabilities in Nepal since 2006
We provide children and adults with disabilities with surgeries and prosthetics, nutrional support, school supplies, educational sponsorships and much more!
This Braille Embosser project will impact the lives of thousands of BVI students.

<p>Our names are Spencer, Hayley, Brendan, and Elizabeth. We are a group of college students at Baldwin-Wallace University in Berea, Ohio. This idea started as a project idea we came up with during a class we all attended, but grew into much more. The class we took was based around researching a global problem that we felt had the most impact on us individually. We found ourselves equally disturbed at increasing rates of human trafficking instances in our world. As we researched and learned more, we found human trafficking was more impactful, and problematic than any of us had ever anticipated. One goal of the class was to find a solution to human trafficking. After weeks of thought and problem-solving, we realized that stopping human trafficking was something we could never accomplish on our own, but decided we would try to do anything we could. We looked over many non-profit organizations who do their best to prevent human trafficking, and found the Nomi Network was one of the best in the world. Their main goal is to create economic oppuritunities for women that are at risk of sex trafficking. The Nomi Network opens businesses that make clothing and other apparrel and those employed are the people at risk of sex trafficking. They have businesses/factories in several countries such as Cambodia and the United States. Their profits go towards proper salary for workers, programs for those who work there, and the opening more factories around the world. As the funds go directly to the Nomi Network, your money will go directly to keeping those at risk of human trafficking out of harms way. Your donations can change the lives of so many, and help transform the world into a better place. </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> Although it might seem our small goal of 500 dollars will not have a large impact, every dollar counts and does more than you think. As we talked to the Nomi Network more, we found that they are trying to open a new factory in India. And even the smallest amounts of money can help create this new business, and help stop human trafficking in india. This money will go to buying new equipment for the factory such as machines, work benches, and building materials. It will aslo go towards paying the salaries of the workers in this factory. Every little bit we earn, even if we dont meet our goal, helps prevent human trafficking in all of the areas they have factories to help those at risk. The more money we can earn, the larger impact we can have and the greater chance we have at stopping human trafficking.</p>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Even the smallest amount of money can have a giant impact on those at risk of human trafficking. No donation is ever too small! Those who are employed by the Nomi Network are kept out of risk by having a safe and secure job at one of the many clothing factories they have around the world.</p>
<p><strong>HOW YOUR MONEY HELPS:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1) $120 buys a machine for the factory</strong></p>
<p><strong>2) $1,000 provides a job for an entire year</strong></p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Don't worry if you cant donate either! Spreading the word to your friends and family is just as helpful as donating! Send it to anyone who you think can help! Hopefully we can make a change in the world one step at a time!</p>
