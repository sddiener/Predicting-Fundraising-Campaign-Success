<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Communication - Connection - Community </h3>
<div>On February 12, 2008, Lawrence “Larry” King – a friend and fellow student at E.O. Green Middle School in Oxnard, California, where I
attended – was murdered in an isolated hate crime by another student, Brandon
McInerney.  Brandon was eventually convicted of killing Larry for being LGBT and gender
non-conforming. In plain view of an entire classroom of eighth grade students,
the drama played out across local and national news, including such media as <i>The Ellen DeGeneres Show </i>and <i>The Advocate</i>, which ran a cover
story about the incident. I now view this particular happening as the moment
that most profoundly changed the course of my life - the singular event that
pushed me to confront myself as a queer teenager in an environment hostile and
unwelcoming toward Otherness, from peers and administration alike.<br/><br/><b>Sexuality and gender identity, however, are not singular events. </b>
</div>
<div><b style=""background-color: initial;""><br/>They are complex, layered, and unique to each individual. </b></div>
<div><b style=""background-color: initial;""><br/>I want to honor this individuality and celebrate the lives of the queer, trans, nonbinary, asexual, and other beautiful friends who fill my life with radical joy. </b></div>
<div><b style=""background-color: initial;""><b><br/>By centering the lives of queer and trans individuals - especially queer and trans women of color - I seek to amplify voices and narratives that might otherwise go unheard or become misconstrued through sensationalized media.</b></b></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/>For a long period after the shooting I retreated into myself, using photography as a tool to project my trauma and investigate what it meant to be young, queer, and confused. With this project I will attempt to explore the development
of my unique embodied identity - particularly in regard to my own burgeoning
sexual identity as a preteen - from an intersectional framework rooted in
feminist ideologies. Through this process I will investigate Larry’s death as an
important facet within a broader cultural dialogue surrounding queerness,
transmisogyny, and sexuality-based bullying within school systems. I will also explore
the intersection of race, gender, and class that informs Larry’s situated
identity and the rhetoric surrounding the shooting.</span></div>
<div>
<br/>I am fascinated by photography's ability to illuminate seemingly mundane or ordinary scenarios, locations, and individuals
and  gain a deeper understanding of people’s livelihoods and the
political underpinnings of their embodied experiences. This project utilizes photography as a medium for reclaiming the turbulent spaces and places that helped shape these queer identities, including my own.  </div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/>I took many photos after the shooting and gained a deeper understanding of myself, including the spaces and places in which I spent much of my adolescent life. </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">However, a photo essay depicting the current state of my community and chosen family of queer, trans, and other LGBTQIA friends doesn't exist yet.

A few months later, in the apple orchard village of Old Manali, I was discovered as a photographer. </p><p>My passion is to return to India, immerse myself in the festivals and rituals, travel with the sadhus, live simply in the villages, and photograph along the way — this time with professional equipment! </p><p><i></i></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434091831/n9uenvwy7i7ryu3fyvll.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><i style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><i><i>Couple in a Cart, 2013</i></i></i></p><h3>My Photography Story</h3><p>From the time I got my iPhone4, I was taking photos; mostly of my son at first, then of everything I found interesting, beautiful, and unique. I took photos often, but I did not consider myself a photographer. In India, I took thousands of photos, enthralled by the colors &amp; contrasts of the culture. While sharing my collection to a group of travelers, one dear man convinced me - actually transmitted a message to me  - <br/>""I was a photographer"".</p><p>Upon my return to California, I, with the help of my son, Calvin, learned how to download photos from my iPhone, edit in Lightroom, print and frame. Within weeks, I had my first photography exhibit I HEARD HER CALLING, which led to several other exhibits.</p><p>My next step was to research cameras. After much investigation and a few trips to the camera shops, I bought my first digital camera, a Fuji X-E1.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434094569/lgoeijjrmllrqeox7pp8.jpg"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""/><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Sadhu in the Light, 2013</i></p><div>

<h3>My Photography Career</h3>
<div>Now that I had a camera, I had to learn how to use it! I photographed every event, fundraiser, band, and festival around the Los Angeles area. In my hometown of Topanga, California, I photographed the Topanga Film Festival, Topanga Days Country Fair, Topanga Earth Day, Chili Cook-Off and Swap Meet, Reggae on the Mountain, Topanga Folk Fest, and Topanga Artist Studio Tour. Before long, I was working with Topanga Messenger covering the Topanga Nutcracker and other local stories.</div>

<p>Here's the tentative itinerary of my photographic journey. I will be flying into Mumbai the first week of November. I will take some days to acclimate to the weather, prepare my gear, and purchase a train ticket to Ajmer, and then onto Pushkar. </p>
<p>November 14-25, 2015 ~ I having been dreaming about going to the Pushkar Camel Fair. I will settle in town early and photograph the desert worn traders as they arrive with their camels and carts. The festival will evolve into spectacle and carnival, culminating on the full moon, with pilgrims bathing in the holy lake.<br/></p>
<p>December/January ~ I am yearning to visit the fishing villages along the Arabian Sea, and possibly travel as far south as Kerala.</p>
<p>January 14-April 22, 2016 ~ Ardh Kumbh Mela in Haridwar. I am excited to experience ceremonies with the sadhus among the millions who travel to this holy festival. </p>
<p>March/April ~ I will celebrate Maha Shivaratri on March 8th, and Holi on March 23rd along the Ganges River, with travel to Varanasi and Rishikesh. As India's temperature rises, I will ascend to the hill stations of Manali and Dharamshala, and finally into the sacred Parvati Valley.</p>
<p>I joyously anticipate sharing these images with you. It is with your contributions that will make my photographic adventure possible. Thank you for participating in this journey with me!</p>

</div></div>","India GoGo - A Photographic JourneyIn 2013, I traveled solo to Maha Kumbh Mela, the largest human festival on Earth, and took photos of the sadhus and pilgrims (holy men & women) with my iPhone4. A few months later, in the apple orchard village of Old Manali, I was discovered as a photographer. My passion is to return to India, immerse myself in the festivals and rituals, travel with the sadhus, live simply in the villages, and photograph along the way — this time with professional equipment! Couple in a Cart, 2013My Photography StoryFrom the time I got my iPhone4, I was taking photos; mostly of my son at first, then of everything I found interesting, beautiful, and unique. I took photos often, but I did not consider myself a photographer. In India, I took thousands of photos, enthralled by the colors & contrasts of the culture. While sharing my collection to a group of travelers, one dear man convinced me - actually transmitted a message to me  - ""I was a photographer"".Upon my return to California, I, with the help of my son, Calvin, learned how to download photos from my iPhone, edit in Lightroom, print and frame. Within weeks, I had my first photography exhibit I HEARD HER CALLING, which led to several other exhibits.My next step was to research cameras. After much investigation and a few trips to the camera shops, I bought my first digital camera, a Fuji X-E1.Sadhu in the Light, 2013

My Photography Career
Now that I had a camera, I had to learn how to use it! I photographed every event, fundraiser, band, and festival around the Los Angeles area. In my hometown of Topanga, California, I photographed the Topanga Film Festival, Topanga Days Country Fair, Topanga Earth Day, Chili Cook-Off and Swap Meet, Reggae on the Mountain, Topanga Folk Fest, and Topanga Artist Studio Tour. Before long, I was working with Topanga Messenger covering the Topanga Nutcracker and other local stories.



   

    



     
I photographed over 150 bands - blues, jazz, rock, reggae, and folk. Several of my photographs were published and many bands started using my photos for their websites and promotions.


  
   


   
And soon after, I photographed my first magazine cover and two double-page spreads!
    


I photographed the Hare Krishna Festival of Chariots in Venice Beach, Bhakti Fest in Joshua Tree, Leimert Park Village African Arts & Music Festival, the Chumash Powwow & Intertribal Gathering in Malibu, and a Hollywood Red Carpet event for the film Miles Away.


   
      


One of my photos was chosen for the book Sacred Pregnancy



   

... and my photo GRATITUDE AND GRAVY FOR ALL was chosen as editor's pick for National Geographic's assignment The Story of Hunger and Hope, and acclaimed chef Mario Batali will be using my photo for his upcoming book FEEDING AMERICA: Stories of Hunger and Hope.


       My Photographic Journey
Here's the tentative itinerary of my photographic journey. I will be flying into Mumbai the first week of November. I will take some days to acclimate to the weather, prepare my gear, and purchase a train ticket to Ajmer, and then onto Pushkar. 
November 14-25, 2015 ~ I having been dreaming about going to the Pushkar Camel Fair. I will settle in town early and photograph the desert worn traders as they arrive with their camels and carts. The festival will evolve into spectacle and carnival, culminating on the full moon, with pilgrims bathing in the holy lake.
December/January ~ I am yearning to visit the fishing villages along the Arabian Sea, and possibly travel as far south as Kerala.
January 14-April 22, 2016 ~ Ardh Kumbh Mela in Haridwar. I am excited to experience ceremonies with the sadhus among the millions who travel to this holy festival. 
March/April ~ I will celebrate Maha Shivaratri on March 8th, and Holi on March 23rd along the Ganges River, with travel to Varanasi and Rishikesh. As India's temperature rises, I will ascend to the hill stations of Manali and Dharamshala, and finally into the sacred Parvati Valley.
I joyously anticipate sharing these images with you. It is with your contributions that will make my photographic adventure possible. Thank you for participating in this journey with me!

<p>This is a project that I have been working on for several months. It began with my archiving older photographic images, filing them and generally organizing all the images I have taken over the past 20 years. As I was reviewing all of these photographs, it occurred to me that some of the images that I had previously decided not to use, either due to accidental camera shake or double exposure, had very strong compositional value to them. Coincidentally, at the same time that I was going through my old photographs, I had been researching historical <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albumen_print"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Albumen printing process</a> for possible use in printing my still life images.

<p>I started by creating a digital negative a la’ Dan Burkholder, with whom I had the pleasure of working back in 1996. After creating the negative and outputting via Lightjet onto clear film, I sent the new experiment to a NYC lab that I knew still did alternative processes. </p>
<p>I was very impressed with the result! In June of 2012 I finished my selection process, choosing the previously discarded images that now shine in this new series. I realized that due to the cost, technical complexity and size limitations that are part of the Albumen process, it may not be the best way to go, but I wanted to maintain the aesthetic of the Albumen printing process as they complemented the images superbly.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><div> <h3>""What is this s***?""</h3> <p>I've been an avid amateur photographer focusing in scenic, landscape, and macrophotography since 2011.  I'm entirely self-funded and self-taught, and I feel that my pride in my output is justified.  On my own, I've sharpened my practical skills quite a bit through dozens of photo shoots, both formal and spur-of-the-moment, and have done a lot of self-study to increase my theoretical knowledge.  I've increased the capabilities of my equipment several times.  Photography may be the only thing I've maintained a true passion for in my adult life.</p>
<p>But there's still a lot of room to improve.  I've got specific, attainable goals to do just that.</p>
<p>This year I'd like to push my skills much further, with an eventual goal of becoming professional-grade.  The major obstacle to that, like with anything worthwhile in life, is funding.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Why I'm harassing you for money:</h3> <p>My biggest goal for this spring is to attend a professional development seminar in Salt Lake City, run by photographers from National Geographic.  (Details can be found at the URL below.)  This incurs a significant amount of travel expense, the admission for the seminar itself, and a hotel stay for the time of the seminar.</p>
<p>Last summer, I took an ad hoc photo retreat to southern Utah, a spectacularly scenic high-desert region with a number of state and national parks. I got some great photos (two of which are used on this page) and learned a lot.  I plan to do this again, combining such a trip with the seminar.  The location, centered around St. George, Utah, is only around six hours away by car from Salt Lake.</p>
<p>Finally, I'd like to improve my gear yet further.  I'm fully pleased with the capabilities of my Pentax K-30 digital SLR; however, my lenses leave a bit to be desired.  As lighter, plastic-bodied ""kit"" lenses, they're at the bottom end of the Pentax product line.  I have my eye, however, on lenses that're significantly nicer.  One of my main complaints during last year's photo retreat was ""These are nice, but oh, what could have been?""  This would resolve that.  Pentax is known for keeping the same lens mount format for the entirety of their history, and current Pentax cameras have no problem mounting and utilizing the K-mount film SLR lenses from thirty years ago.  Therefore, an investment in quality lenses is going to be a lifelong resource even as I upgrade my camera bodies over time.</p>

<h3>Transparency:</h3>
<p>I HATE asking people for money.  Like, really super extra hate it.  One of the only ways I can bring myself to do so is to be extra transparent and open about the circumstances under which I'm constrained, and share full detail on what I'd like to do.  So here's the full breakdown of why I'm asking for so much:</p>

<b>Fuel</b>: $500 (estimated).  The round trip to go from Seattle, to Salt Lake, to St George, and back to Seattle is a little over 2,300 miles, or 3,700 km.  At current fuel prices, that alone will run just over $300 in petrol. I've added another $200 to account for side trips to the various national parks and incidental driving for things like family visits.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Hotel</b> for two nights in Salt Lake while at the seminar: $100 per night, or $200 total.</li>
<li>

<li>
<b>Pentax DA☆ 16-50mm f/2.8 wide-angle zoom lens</b>: currently $820 on Amazon.  This is a near-direct replacement for my current DAL 18-55mm kit lens, but is very slightly wider angle and less zoom, and is much more capable in low light.  Since sunrises and sunsets are some of my most frequent photo shoots, this is important.  It will serve as my primary lens for scenic photography and is highly capable for general use as well.  Pentax's DA☆ line is one of their highest end offerings; only the DA Limited prime lenses are better.  Optical clarity, low-light performance, and image detail should be very significantly increased.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Pentax DA 55-300mm f/4-5.8 zoom telephoto lens</b>: currently $450 on Amazon.  This is an exact, direct replacement for my current DAL 55-300 kit lens.  It offers no new capability, but is more sturdily constructed out of metal instead of plastic, and has higher quality optics and additional lens coatings for better image quality.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Pentax DFA 100mm f/2.8 macro lens</b>: currently $560 on Amazon.  This doesn't replace any of my current gear, but offers significant new capability.  Macro lenses are optimized for very close focus and outstanding detail on small, detailed subjects such as insects.  I don't currently have a macro lens at all.  This isn't necessary for scenic or landscape photography, but is important to expand my work more fully into the several types of photography that I'm interested in.  Like the DA☆ lenses, the DFAs are a higher grade than the baseline DA or kit DAL lenses.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Fees</b>: up to $480.  IndieGogo charges 4% fee for all donations received if a Flexible Funding campaign meets its funding goal, but 9% otherwise.  My expectations are not very high, so I anticipate 9%.  Additionally, credit card processors charge 3% transaction fees.  If this campaign misses its goal by only $1 (thus maximizing the 9% fee, and avoiding the 4%) then IndieGoGo will charge $359.91 and credit card processing $119.97, for a total of $479.88.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>NOT included</b> at all: costs for routine expenses such as food and park admissions.  These are relatively trivial and I'd feel bad asking for help with them.  This also includes small incidental equipment such as additional battery packs and lens cleaning supplies.<br/>

<li>
<b>Combined total</b>: $3,903.88 including fees.<br/>
</li>
</ul>I'm going to be perfectly honest -- I feel that this trip is fairly necessary to my ongoing sanity.  It's absolutely going to happen even if I don't get a single dollar of donations.  However, it'll be happening on a credit card, and $4000 will take me a rough guess of 6-7 months to pay back off.  Donations will make it much, much easier to do this without incurring so much debt.  I'm not expecting friends and family to absorb the cost of my trip so much as laying out all my expenditures so that anyone inclined to chip in can do so, fully informed.<p></p>

</div></div>","""What is this s***?"" I've been an avid amateur photographer focusing in scenic, landscape, and macrophotography since 2011.  I'm entirely self-funded and self-taught, and I feel that my pride in my output is justified.  On my own, I've sharpened my practical skills quite a bit through dozens of photo shoots, both formal and spur-of-the-moment, and have done a lot of self-study to increase my theoretical knowledge.  I've increased the capabilities of my equipment several times.  Photography may be the only thing I've maintained a true passion for in my adult life.
But there's still a lot of room to improve.  I've got specific, attainable goals to do just that.
This year I'd like to push my skills much further, with an eventual goal of becoming professional-grade.  The major obstacle to that, like with anything worthwhile in life, is funding.   Why I'm harassing you for money: My biggest goal for this spring is to attend a professional development seminar in Salt Lake City, run by photographers from National Geographic.  (Details can be found at the URL below.)  This incurs a significant amount of travel expense, the admission for the seminar itself, and a hotel stay for the time of the seminar.
Last summer, I took an ad hoc photo retreat to southern Utah, a spectacularly scenic high-desert region with a number of state and national parks. I got some great photos (two of which are used on this page) and learned a lot.  I plan to do this again, combining such a trip with the seminar.  The location, centered around St. George, Utah, is only around six hours away by car from Salt Lake.
Finally, I'd like to improve my gear yet further.  I'm fully pleased with the capabilities of my Pentax K-30 digital SLR; however, my lenses leave a bit to be desired.  As lighter, plastic-bodied ""kit"" lenses, they're at the bottom end of the Pentax product line.  I have my eye, however, on lenses that're significantly nicer.  One of my main complaints during last year's photo retreat was ""These are nice, but oh, what could have been?""  This would resolve that.  Pentax is known for keeping the same lens mount format for the entirety of their history, and current Pentax cameras have no problem mounting and utilizing the K-mount film SLR lenses from thirty years ago.  Therefore, an investment in quality lenses is going to be a lifelong resource even as I upgrade my camera bodies over time.

""What's in it for me?""
Check out the Perks section to the right!  I've got two four five MANY now, and will be brainstorming further perks to add.  I'm always up for suggestions as well!
Transparency:
I HATE asking people for money.  Like, really super extra hate it.  One of the only ways I can bring myself to do so is to be extra transparent and open about the circumstances under which I'm constrained, and share full detail on what I'd like to do.  So here's the full breakdown of why I'm asking for so much:



Admissions cost to the seminar: $199.

Rental car: $0.  I originally had planned $350 for a rental car, but have since changed my plan.  I'll be taking my personal vehicle for this trip.

Fuel: $500 (estimated).  The round trip to go from Seattle, to Salt Lake, to St George, and back to Seattle is a little over 2,300 miles, or 3,700 km.  At current fuel prices, that alone will run just over $300 in petrol. I've added another $200 to account for side trips to the various national parks and incidental driving for things like family visits.


Hotel for two nights in Salt Lake while at the seminar: $100 per night, or $200 total.

Hotel for five nights in St. George: $139 per night, or $695 total.

Pentax DA☆ 16-50mm f/2.8 wide-angle zoom lens: currently $820 on Amazon.  This is a near-direct replacement for my current DAL 18-55mm kit lens, but is very slightly wider angle and less zoom, and is much more capable in low light.  Since sunrises and sunsets are some of my most frequent photo shoots, this is important.  It will serve as my primary lens for scenic photography and is highly capable for general use as well.  Pentax's DA☆ line is one of their highest end offerings; only the DA Limited prime lenses are better.  Optical clarity, low-light performance, and image detail should be very significantly increased.


Pentax DA 55-300mm f/4-5.8 zoom telephoto lens: currently $450 on Amazon.  This is an exact, direct replacement for my current DAL 55-300 kit lens.  It offers no new capability, but is more sturdily constructed out of metal instead of plastic, and has higher quality optics and additional lens coatings for better image quality.


Pentax DFA 100mm f/2.8 macro lens: currently $560 on Amazon.  This doesn't replace any of my current gear, but offers significant new capability.  Macro lenses are optimized for very close focus and outstanding detail on small, detailed subjects such as insects.  I don't currently have a macro lens at all.  This isn't necessary for scenic or landscape photography, but is important to expand my work more fully into the several types of photography that I'm interested in.  Like the DA☆ lenses, the DFAs are a higher grade than the baseline DA or kit DAL lenses.


Fees: up to $480.  IndieGogo charges 4% fee for all donations received if a Flexible Funding campaign meets its funding goal, but 9% otherwise.  My expectations are not very high, so I anticipate 9%.  Additionally, credit card processors charge 3% transaction fees.  If this campaign misses its goal by only $1 (thus maximizing the 9% fee, and avoiding the 4%) then IndieGoGo will charge $359.91 and credit card processing $119.97, for a total of $479.88.


NOT included at all: costs for routine expenses such as food and park admissions.  These are relatively trivial and I'd feel bad asking for help with them.  This also includes small incidental equipment such as additional battery packs and lens cleaning supplies.


Combined total: $3,903.88 including fees.

I'm going to be perfectly honest -- I feel that this trip is fairly necessary to my ongoing sanity.  It's absolutely going to happen even if I don't get a single dollar of donations.  However, it'll be happening on a credit card, and $4000 will take me a rough guess of 6-7 months to pay back off.  Donations will make it much, much easier to do this without incurring so much debt.  I'm not expecting friends and family to absorb the cost of my trip so much as laying out all my expenditures so that anyone inclined to chip in can do so, fully informed.
The Impact:
 With the additional skills I hope to acquire during the seminar, as well as four to five days of shooting afterward to exercise and solidify the knowledge, I feel confident that I will grow significantly as a photographer.  As you are all my audience, with my entire body of work freely available on Photobucket and Facebook, this means I fill your eyes with more and better eye candy.  
Eventually I hope to produce work of such a quality as to be employed as a photographer.  This is a good step along that path.
Risks & Challenges:
 Risks for you, the potential contributor?  There aren't any, really.  The worst that could happen is that for some reason I don't make it to the seminar, and your money doesn't go towards it.  In that case, I will work with any contributors to offer a full refund of their money, including any fees taken by IndieGoGo or credit card processors.
Challenges for me?  Only the best kind: creative challenges.  It will be my job to learn from the seminar and to put that knowledge to work producing better art than I have at any point to date.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Yuri!!! on Ice on Ice would be a photoshoot and meet up at the Kettler Capitals Iceplex the Sunday of Otakon (8/13).  Otakon is the perfect opportunity as one of the biggest anime cons in the area means that there's a better opportunity to have a wide variety of cosplayers from the show meet up.  Having this meet up and photoshoot at an ice rink makes it even better since fans can show off their skills or learn to skate.</p>
<p>I have been cosplaying for a little over 3 years now and I have experience running photoshoots at Katsucon, Otakon, and Anime USA.  After being introduced to Yuri!!! on Ice by my friends, I knew I had to cosplay Viktor.  I completed my cosplay back in April and now I want to contribute to fandom even more by organizing this event.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The Kettler requires $450 to rent out an hour's worth of ice.  That $450 includes a Zamboni resurfacing and skate rentals.</p>
<p>Indiegogo's minimum campaign goal is $500, so the extra $50 can go towards any fees or taxes that might pop up.</p>
<p>Also, we have some stretch goals:</p>
<ol>
<li>$950- 2 Hours of Ice <b>NO LONGER AN OPTION</b><ul><li>Instead of renting the ice for an hour, we would get 2 hours- that's more time to socialize, practice skating, and make some cool photos!</li></ul>
</li>
<li>$1150- Hired Photographer <strong>EDIT: AT $750</strong><ul>
<li>In addition to 2 hours worth of ice,</li>
<li>for $200, we hire a photographer to take a pre-agreed number of photos that would only be for personal use or promotion (not for sale by anyone afterwards)</li>
<li>Photographers would be able to make a bid and all paying contributors would have the chance to vote for their favorite based on a portfolio sample</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If we exceed funding but don't reach a stretch goal, then the leftover would go to the local LBGT+ based charity, <a href=""http://www.casaruby.org/index.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Casa Ruby</a>.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Benefits</h3>
<p>Why not have this shoot at Katsucon?  Renting out the ice gives us a private setting so we're not competing with other skaters for space and allows a comfortable setting of like-minded people.  Renting out an indoor rink also has the advantage of good lighting and being more similar to the actual backdrops from the show.</p>
<p>Additionally, the perks for contributions are comparable with the regular skate and rental fees of the Kettler- $14 for adults.  A single admission for our event is $17 and each tier above that lowers the price per person which means this is a great deal.</p>
<p>Why the Kettler in particular?  The Kettler is home to DC's own hockey team, the Caps.  That means this is a high quality facility and decent sized ice rinks.  The location itself is also convenient since it is a five minute walk from the metro and also has a massive parking garage.  Once we're funded, I'll put out step by step instructions of how to get there just in case because the Kettler is, rather uniquely, on the roof of a mall.  There are plenty of signs on how to get there once inside the mall, but I'd hate for anyone to get delayed because they walked a block in the wrong direction or something.</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</span></p>
<p>The only risk we face is this campaign not being funding.  Since this is an all or nothing campaign, if it doesn't get funded, then any contributions would return to the people who made them.  Once we are funded though, contributors will be given a poll on what time we want to start so it would be unlikely that someone would miss it.  The rink itself is metro accessible and has plenty of parking.</p>
<p>Anyone who would like to go, but does not want to contribute needs to reconsider.  The only real risk for our campaign is it not getting funded.  If it doesn't work out then you will get your money back.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Not going to Otakon?</p>
<ul>
<li>If you're local, you can join us anyway!  The ice rink rental is not part of Otakon, so it's fine if you're not going to the con.  Just remember to contribute!</li>
<li>If you're out of town, but would love to see this photoshoot happen anyway, please feel free to donate whatever amount you wish.  Anything is appreciated!</li>
<li>If you're a bit tight on cash at the moment, please get the word out as an alternative.  Letting people know helps make the event more inclusive and people who might not otherwise know can hear about it.  Besides, once Otakon rolls around, maybe things will be a little better and you'll be able to join us!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Who's Allowed to Go?</h3>
<p>Everyone!</p>
<p>Cosplayers, photographers, and friends are all welcome.</p>
<p>After we're funded, a survey will be sent out and contributors will need to supply the names of attendees.  You'll be able to change these up until the morning of.  This will prevent people from joining who haven't paid or aren't spoken for.  It's not fair to make only some people pay.</p>
<h3><strong>The Setup</strong></h3>
<p>Here's how the meet up will be scheduled:</p>
<ol>
<li>Contributors will be sent a survey in advance to vote on the exact time we should meet on that Sunday.</li>
<li>The first half-hour will serve as a time block for everyone to arrive, warmup, and socialize.  Friends and photographers not in cosplay can also use this time to skate</li>
<li> Then we'll have the Zamboni make the ice nice and smooth.  Everyone needs to arrive by this time too or else they'll risk being shut out.</li>
<li>For the second half-hour, I ask that only Yuri!!! on Ice cosplayers and photographers skate who need to be on the ice.  This will allow for better and easier photos.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p>**Neither myself, the organizer, or the Kettler Iceplex are liable for any possible injuries.  By attending you accept this and are responsible to make your own choices when acting in potentially risky ways.  Minors need to be accompanied by someone over 18 years old (they will also need admission).**</p>

The only risk we face is this campaign not being funding.  Since this is an all or nothing campaign, if it doesn't get funded, then any contributions would return to the people who made them.  Once we are funded though, contributors will be given a poll on what time we want to start so it would be unlikely that someone would miss it.  The rink itself is metro accessible and has plenty of parking.
Anyone who would like to go, but does not want to contribute needs to reconsider.  The only real risk for our campaign is it not getting funded.  If it doesn't work out then you will get your money back.

Other Ways You Can Help
Not going to Otakon?

If you're local, you can join us anyway!  The ice rink rental is not part of Otakon, so it's fine if you're not going to the con.  Just remember to contribute!
If you're out of town, but would love to see this photoshoot happen anyway, please feel free to donate whatever amount you wish.  Anything is appreciated!
If you're a bit tight on cash at the moment, please get the word out as an alternative.  Letting people know helps make the event more inclusive and people who might not otherwise know can hear about it.  Besides, once Otakon rolls around, maybe things will be a little better and you'll be able to join us!

Who's Allowed to Go?
Everyone!
Cosplayers, photographers, and friends are all welcome.
After we're funded, a survey will be sent out and contributors will need to supply the names of attendees.  You'll be able to change these up until the morning of.  This will prevent people from joining who haven't paid or aren't spoken for.  It's not fair to make only some people pay.
The Setup
Here's how the meet up will be scheduled:

Contributors will be sent a survey in advance to vote on the exact time we should meet on that Sunday.
The first half-hour will serve as a time block for everyone to arrive, warmup, and socialize.  Friends and photographers not in cosplay can also use this time to skate
 Then we'll have the Zamboni make the ice nice and smooth.  Everyone needs to arrive by this time too or else they'll risk being shut out.
For the second half-hour, I ask that only Yuri!!! on Ice cosplayers and photographers skate who need to be on the ice.  This will allow for better and easier photos.

 
**Neither myself, the organizer, or the Kettler Iceplex are liable for any possible injuries.  By attending you accept this and are responsible to make your own choices when acting in potentially risky ways.  Minors need to be accompanied by someone over 18 years old (they will also need admission).**",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>My name is Randy Lemoine and I am a cityscape/landscape photographer based out of New York City, USA. I have been actively shooting film and digital cameras for approximately 10 years and enjoy the process of taking a specific subject or idea and transforming that imagery into a pleasing photo people can enjoy.

<h3>Spiegel der Seele <i>(Mirrors of the soul)</i>
</h3>
<p>Photography exhibition by <strong>Marco Pejrolo</strong><br/>With original texts by Sudabeh Mohafez and Alberto Salza<br/>Original songs by Antun Opic</p>
<p>Gasteig - Munich <strong>24th  January – 13th February 2017</strong></p>
<p><a href=""http://www.spiegel.photos"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>www.spiegel.photos</strong></a></p>
<p>The project wants to create a visual and  emotional bridge between the people portrayed in the photos and the exhibition visitors, by using the power of photography to do what is usually impossible every day: we are enveloped in our hectic lives - often superficial and distrustful - and we don't seem to be able to find the time for a deep visual contact. We are unable to listen while we are looking at something.<br/>It's as simple as that.</p>I asked myself what role photography could have in what was happening around us. Today. In Germany, where I live. Reporting? Witnessing? Denouncing? I asked myself how a photographer could sympathize with the reality around us and so I tried to involve the viewer, to make him an active subject. The image itself wasn't enough, photography had to become a mirror.<p>In the mirror the subject becomes the object: contemplating itself, recognizing itself and identifying with it. It unveils itself. If you stand in front of your image a bit longer, the subject won't just be reflected but will start reflecting: thoughts, emotions, feelings will come up.<br/>What if the surface weren't a mirror but another face in a photo?  The face of one of the unknown people who have dragged their existence up here, fleeing from the war and destruction? Could we spot anything about ourselves in that picture? About our past? Our identity? Is there a common trait between us and them that could let us see any thoughts, emotions, feelings?<br/>People's eyes become mirrors where life and the soul can be reflected. Wide open eyes, smiling, noble, serious, hidden, innocent, distrustful eyes, where you can glimpse or imagine a glare of their existence or of ours.<br/>The photography exhibition “Spiegel der Seele” suggests interaction between the viewer and the photographs on display. In each of them you will meet some eyes in front of which you can stop, like in front of a mirror, and wait until you can perceive the little part of you reflected by that look. Or you may see what is hidden within those eyes, in the depth of their light and write about it. Therefore, next to each photo on display there is a space where you can note down your impressions while contemplating the image: a collective album of thoughts and feelings that the snapshot will have aroused in the viewers.<br/>This mirroring process will be accompanied by some texts written by the German writer Sudabeh Mohafez and by the Italian anthropologist Alberto Salza, each of them inspired by a portrait on display. Some original songs written and sung by Antun Opic will be the soundtrack of this visual and emotional experience.<br/>The whole artistic production, including portraits, texts and songs, will be included in the exhibition catalogue.</p>

All funds will be used to cover the exhibition costs: producing the CD, printing the book, normal printing production expenses such as press proof sheets, distribution cost and other miscellaneous expenses.

<b>RISKS AND CHALLANGES:</b><p></p>
<p></p>
<p>While there are no real risks for getting prints to a backer, there can be a few challenges with setting up a photo session. Here are some potential causes for delay: <br/>1. Some backers will want their session right away, while others may be interested in postponing the session to a later date. <br/>2. Scheduling can be difficult, and the level of difficulty increases with the number of people added to a photo session.</p>
<p>For each photo session reward, I have listed ""November 2013"" for the estimated delivery date. This campaign will be opened by the end of September and closed by the end of October. Because lighting equipment is really large/heavy/delicate, it can take a while to ship. Listing the date at October gives me a month to have the equipment shipped after ordering it. In this sense, the ""delivery date"" is more like a ""start date"": sessions can start as soon as I have the equipment.</p>
<p>Final risk: The estimated ""delivery date"" of photo sessions, as stated before, depends on the delivery date of the new equipment. If an essential item is back-ordered, backers with a photo session package will be notified immediately and updated on the expected time available to shoot.</p>

Her work is distinguished by its scope of subject, graceful intimacy and seductive color. Nowhere are these characteristics more powerfully represented than in Byrd's images of the New Orleans region's remarkable Carnival season. And we are now trying to preserve these iconic pictures so that we can continue to enjoy the art she has created. </span><br/></span></p>

</div></div>","Our Story
Syndey Byrd (July 3, 1944) – is an artist, ethnographer and journalist who, over the past forty years, has devoted much of her life to documenting the culture and celebrations of Southern Louisiana in color photographs. Her work is distinguished by its scope of subject, graceful intimacy and seductive color. Nowhere are these characteristics more powerfully represented than in Byrd's images of the New Orleans region's remarkable Carnival season. And we are now trying to preserve these iconic pictures so that we can continue to enjoy the art she has created. 
 
As is true with many artists, Syndey has been working as a freelance photographer her entire life.  And now that she is reaching retirement, Syndey cannot get to all the events New Orleans offers that she loves to document .  Sadly, this is creates a poor financial situation for an incredibly talented artist.


The Impact
 
Having photographed so many New Orleans events for over 40 years, Syndey has understandably taken a  very large number of pictures during that time.  Her current archive is in a slide format and needs to be converted into digital so that we can preserve her excellent work.  Our goal once these archives are converted, is to set up a website for her where she can display and sell her work and also, help her earn an income. 
 
 


What We Need & What You Get
The contributions will go towards hard drives for storing the pictures, a slide scanner to convert the slides to a digital format, and paying assistants for their labor.  You get a signed copy of any of the photos in this slideshow. You can choose a 8x10 or 16x20 print.

<p align=""center""><em>Scott MacQuarrie</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The polar regions are some of the most extreme environments on this planet. Yet life exists there. These regions are little understood and visited by few people. Life on land in Antarctica is almost non-existent with less than 2% of the continent not covered by ice. There are few creatures that can survive in these harsh conditions and most of them leave during the dark, cold Antarctic winter. Yet, life thrives in Antarctica, primarily in the ocean.</p>
<p>Antarctica is the coldest, windiest, driest, highest and most extreme continent on this planet. It has only been in the last 100 years or so that humans have had the technology to travel and explore Antarctica. It is still poorly understood even though it’s the subject of almost continuous study. <strong>It is Life in the Extreme.</strong></p>
<p>I plan to join two polar photographic expeditions, the first to the Arctic in August and the second to Antarctica in November, with two objectives:</p>
<ol>
<li>To show these remote parts of the world and increase our understanding of them; and</li>
<li>To show you through my work the visual experiences Antarctica and the Arctic provide and the intensity of experiencing them. </li>
</ol><p>Both of these expeditions will involve ice-grade vessels with skilled and experienced crews, which should reduce the risks as much as possible. Both expeditions will be comprised of professional photographers and enthusiasts and the focus is on the creation of great work.</p>
<p>The Arctic expedition in August will leave from Svalbard, Norway above the Arctic Circle, cross to Greenland and travel south to Iceland. We won’t be below the Arctic Circle until reaching Iceland.</p>
<p>The Antarctic expedition in November will travel from Ushuaia, Argentina across the Drake Passage, 600 miles of the roughest ocean water in the world. We will also be transporting scientists to an Antarctic base and will be given the unique opportunity to visit and photograph there.</p>
<p>Each trip is an expensive undertaking. If I reach half of the required funds, I will go on the Arctic expedition. If I reach close to full funding, I will also go on the Antarctic expedition.</p>
<p>I have been to both Antarctica and Iceland. I am a professional photographer with over ten years experience, having won both national and international awards for my work. I am an X-Rite Coloratti, a voting member of the American Society of Media Photographers (ASMP), and have been awarded a Certified Professional Photographer (CPP) designation by the Professional Photographers of America (PPA). I invite you to see examples of my work at <a href=""http://www.zwcx.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.zwcx.com</a>.</p>
<p>In early May the first US gallery exhibition of my work opens at the Avery Gallery, 390 Roswell Street, Marietta, Georgia 30060. The gallery has been very supportive of my work. Their website <a href=""http://www.averygallery.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.averygallery.com</a> features some of my work that is being exhibited. I will be at the gallery May 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> for the opening. If you can attend the opening I would be delighted to meet and talk with you.</p>
<p>I do need and welcome your support through the pre-purchase of my work. I am offering limited edition prints that will be printed entirely by me on my Epson 3800 and Epson 9900 printers to museum archival standards using some of the best fine art papers available from Moab paper and using Ultrachrome K3 inks. Each print will be signed and numbered by me on the front and back and will include a Certificate of Authenticity. Each print will ONLY be available in the sizes described as part of this campaign. With the exception of up to two Artist’s Proofs, I will create no other prints of these sizes for these photographs. Each of the limited edition prints will be shipped unframed in tubes (the smallest shipped flat) and will also include my recommendations for framing and framing materials.</p>
<p>If you choose to purchase any of my work described below I will pay the shipping and any applicable Canadian taxes, such as HST or GST.</p>
<p>I will be creating a special email list that I will update during the expeditions ahead of other sources. I will also be updating my blog, Facebook, Google+, and Twitter with activities before, during, and after the expeditions. The main purpose of these trips is to share the experience with others, so I’m going to do exactly that.</p>
<p>I am also going to donate 10% of the funds raised in this campaign to the David Suzuki Foundation where it will support a variety of climate and environmental initiatives.

Nicaragua is the second poorest country in Latin America; the average family lives on less than 10 US dollars a day, barely enough to put food on the table and a roof over their head.  16% of the population survives on less than 2 US dollars a day. Though most children enter the school system, many leave early to help their families financially. For the families, the long-term benefits of education hold much less value than the short-term financial benefits of children working to add to the family income. In its small way, THROUGH MY EYES is intended to address this reality.</p>
<p>Four young students in the Province of Rivas will each be given a camera to document their lives for a week. At the end of the week, the photos will be uploaded to a computer at which time the child and myself will select the photos that best document his/her daily life. Once all four children have selected their photos, they will be printed and presented in galleries across Nicaragua and the United States. As well, their school will be given a computer and the camera to integrate photography into their curriculum. A photo book of their work will be made available for sale through my website, <a href=""http://paulschlindweinphotography.weebly.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://paulschlindweinphotography.weebly.com</a>. Half the proceeds from the sale of the photo book “THROUGH MY EYES” will be donated to the San Juan Del Sur Mobile Library Rural Schools Outreach Program which makes available books to rural school children who would otherwise have no access to them. The other half of the proceeds will be used to help fund more THROUGH MY EYES projects throughout Central America.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT YOUR DONATION BUYS:</strong><br/><br/> 4 digital camera with memory cards and rechargeable batteries which will be donated to the children’s schools  [200ea]</p>
<p>4 computers which will also be donated to the children’s schools  [600ea]</p>
<p>4 printers and 4 reams of photo quality paper to print students’ photos will be donated to each school [200ea]</p>
<p>4 solar powered generators, one for each school [most rural schools do not have electricity, so to operate the computer a generator is necessary] [600ea]</p>
<p>A lesson outline for the teachers to integrate photography into their classes.</p>
<p>Logistical expenses- travel, photo printing and distribution</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What you’ll get by donating:</h2>
<p>First and foremost, you’ll have the knowledge that you helped a student find a means of expressing him/herself. Beyond that, you’ll know that a rural school in Nicaragua will have access to technology previously unavailable to them.

<p>After 25 years as a television photojournalist [aka cameraman] I relocated to South America. While I continued to work sporadically in the television industry, I took up photography as a second career.</p>
<p>Throughout my journeys through Latin America I was struck by the desire to learn of the school aged children despite having even the most basic educational tools.</p>
<p>When I lived in San Francisco, I created and taught a media arts discipline at the School of the Arts High School. Students were taught the basics of video and film production and were offered the opportunity to create personal video projects. What started as a program for 12 students blossomed into a program of 30 with dozens more on the waiting list. It was evident that these children were starving for a way to express themselves.

I am also pursuing an MFA in creative writing at Antioch University Los Angeles. My photography, poetry, and short stories have been published in The Indigenous Sovereignty Issue of The Peak, Hinchas de Poesía, Poets Responding to SB1070, La Bloga, KUIKATL Literary Journal, nineteen-sixty-nine an Ethnic Studies Journal, Blood Lotus, REDzine, Kalyani Magazine, Along the River II Anthology, among others. <br/><br/>I've had numerous photography exhibits throughout California including: “The Waiting Compendium” at the South Gate Art Gallery, South Gate, CA; “Renuncia” at El Sereno Gallery, El Sereno, CA; “Renuncia” at Corazón del Pueblo, Boyle Heights, CA; “Concrete Reality” at the Play House, Long Beach, CA;  “My Chapina Roots” at the YogArt Show, Whittier, CA; “Capturing Life” for Operation Smile fundraiser at the Museum of Latin American Art (MOLAA), Long Beach, CA; ""Frontera: De mi lado"" photography exhibit for Proyecto Esperanza fundraiser at the Museum of Latin American Art (MOLAA), Long Beach, CA; and “The Rhythm of Landscape” at the Sun Rise Poetry Series, San Francisco’s Mission District, Ca. <br/><br/>On March 2012, I took part in the 5th Annual ‘Día de la Mujer' exhibition in San Ysidro, Ca.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>PROJECT:</strong></div>
<p>I seek to curate a photography exhibit for the young girls in my community. It is my objective to photograph STRONG / SUCCESSFUL / REVOLUTIONARY women who will inspire these young girls to follow their dreams and to become who they want to be. I want young girls to learn how to recognize and overcome oppression whether it comes from government institutions, family members, or friends.</p>
<p>My desire is to raise awareness by planting the seeds of empowerment in the minds of young girls.</p>
<p>The money raised through this campaign will allow me to share these photos with my community and the world. I will also publish a book that will be given as a GIFT to every woman who attends the exhibit. <br/><br/> Since I will be publishing this book on my own, I have decided to work with a team consisting of an Art editor who will do the layout of the book and a book editor who will work editing the stories of resilience of each revolutionary woman. Together, we will work to produce a book and an exhibition that will not only inform, but also inspire young women to overcome any obstacle they experience throughout their lives.</p>

<p> </p></div>","My name is Claudia D. Hernández. I was born and raised in Guatemala. I am a bilingual educator in the city of Los Angeles and I am currently finishing a Masters in Multicultural Education at Dominguez Hills. I am also pursuing an MFA in creative writing at Antioch University Los Angeles. My photography, poetry, and short stories have been published in The Indigenous Sovereignty Issue of The Peak, Hinchas de Poesía, Poets Responding to SB1070, La Bloga, KUIKATL Literary Journal, nineteen-sixty-nine an Ethnic Studies Journal, Blood Lotus, REDzine, Kalyani Magazine, Along the River II Anthology, among others. I've had numerous photography exhibits throughout California including: “The Waiting Compendium” at the South Gate Art Gallery, South Gate, CA; “Renuncia” at El Sereno Gallery, El Sereno, CA; “Renuncia” at Corazón del Pueblo, Boyle Heights, CA; “Concrete Reality” at the Play House, Long Beach, CA;  “My Chapina Roots” at the YogArt Show, Whittier, CA; “Capturing Life” for Operation Smile fundraiser at the Museum of Latin American Art (MOLAA), Long Beach, CA; ""Frontera: De mi lado"" photography exhibit for Proyecto Esperanza fundraiser at the Museum of Latin American Art (MOLAA), Long Beach, CA; and “The Rhythm of Landscape” at the Sun Rise Poetry Series, San Francisco’s Mission District, Ca. On March 2012, I took part in the 5th Annual ‘Día de la Mujer' exhibition in San Ysidro, Ca.
 
PROJECT:
I seek to curate a photography exhibit for the young girls in my community. It is my objective to photograph STRONG / SUCCESSFUL / REVOLUTIONARY women who will inspire these young girls to follow their dreams and to become who they want to be. I want young girls to learn how to recognize and overcome oppression whether it comes from government institutions, family members, or friends.
My desire is to raise awareness by planting the seeds of empowerment in the minds of young girls.
The money raised through this campaign will allow me to share these photos with my community and the world. I will also publish a book that will be given as a GIFT to every woman who attends the exhibit.  Since I will be publishing this book on my own, I have decided to work with a team consisting of an Art editor who will do the layout of the book and a book editor who will work editing the stories of resilience of each revolutionary woman. Together, we will work to produce a book and an exhibition that will not only inform, but also inspire young women to overcome any obstacle they experience throughout their lives.
 
EXPENSES:

Book designer -$2,000
Book Editor - $2,000
Print 150 books  $5000
(given as a GIFT to each young
girl who attends the event.)  


Traveling expenses  $3,000 
Exhibit/reception expenses $1,000

TOTAL =$15,300
 
Goal – Fees = Your Take-away $16,500 - Fees = $15,345

They had success with another book of mine called T<em>he Surfboard: Art, Style, Stoke.</em> That book sold well and still sells more than six years later - and any book that makes money these days is a good book.</p>
<p>I was an editor at Surfer Magazine for 10 years before leaving to become a freelance writer. Since 1999 I have had 15 books published, but I tell people that because of Internet access to information, being a book writer these days is like being a great Viking rower just when they switched to sail power: Information is online for free, so books don't sell like they used to. And that makes photo budgets thin.</p>
<p><em>The Surfboard: Art, Style, Stoke</em> sold well in hardcover then softcover, and the publisher hopes to have similar success with <em>365 Surfboards</em>, which will be one in a series that began with <em>365 Guitars</em>. I am hoping to persuade them to do <em>365 Skateboards</em> next.</p>
<p>And after that, maybe <em>365 Snowboards.</em></p>
<p>The mission of <em>365 Surfboards</em> is to collect that many existing, quality portraits of surfboards past, present and future from surfers, shapers and collectors. Collect them all, let Ben sort them out and then present the boards chronologically, describing each board in detail but also explaining where that board lies in the arc from the Caballito de tortora of 3000 BC Peru, to the olo and alaia of old Owyhee of the 19th Century and then into the 20th and 21st Centuries: hardwoods to balsa to plastics to the space age carbon fiber and composites of the 21st Century.</p>
<p>Some of the photographs are being provided by surfers, shapers and collectors but a fotografista named Lucia Griggi is working hard to take portraits of surfers and their boards. In the last two weeks of January Lucia did a working road trip from Seattle to La Jolla and took portraits of Matt Warshaw, Gerry Lopez, Greg Noll, Dale Webster, Jeff Clark, Wingnut, Chris Malloy, Bruce Brown, Griff Snyder, Skylar Peak, Allen Sarlo, Randy Hild, Eric ""Bird"" Huffman and Fernando Aguerre - all the way down in La Jolla.</p>
<p>Lucia's portraits are great and she will be taking more from La Jolla to Santa Barbara as the book is produced through March and April.</p>
<p>This Indiegogo is designed to pump up the photo budget for the book. </p>
<p>Here on the cusp of the Internet revolution, publishing is such these days that photo budgets are often a fraction of what they need to be if everyone was being paid properly. The funds raised will pay Lucia for her portraits and also will be used to pay Guy Motil, Jorge Salas and other photographers and collectors for existing photos of surfboards, with action photos and other visuals.</p>
<p>Three hundred and sixty five surfboards is a lot of surfboards and while that many will allow this book to be detailed and comprehensive, a better photo budget will help to improve the quality and variety of those images.</p>
<p>There is a wide variety of perks available to those who pitch in: Take your pick from the author's extensive collection of historic surfing DVD - inventory available on request.</p>
<p>A copy of the book signed by the author and Lucia and maybe some of the surfers featured in the book - if we can track them down.</p>
<p>Quality prints of images from the book, if that interests you.</p>
<p>For anyone who really throws down, we'll consider sending Lucia to your house for a personal portrait session - if your house is within range and reason of southern Orange County.</p>

<b>WOW!</b> THANK YOU ALL for helping me hit my goal!!! My life has become saturated with donuts and dress-up AND I LOVE IT. We are nearing the end of photo shooting and, man-- is it a challenge to be director/ set designer/ hair and makeup/ model/ editorial eye/ publisher! Especially as an admittedly neurotic hyper-critical perfectionist.</div>
<div>For a bit of a timeline: I am shooting for a to-press date the last week of November, with the goal of shipping all calendars by the second week of December for holiday arrival. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<b>I am so grateful for everyone who helped make this project possible.</b> After the project has gone to press, I will continue taking orders via the publisher's website, so you'll be able to order whenever is convenient for you until the end of 2012! I will post a link accordingly. </div>
<div>I had a few minor technical issues with my page, resulting in my ""claimed perks"" disappearing. NO WORRIES to those who have already pre-ordered a calendar-- I still have all your information and will be fulfilling the orders as promised :o) <br/>

<div>Overwhelmed by everyones support!! This project is now *well* underway and I am having such a blast working on it! I never realized how much WORK it is putting together photo shoots, ::phew:: ! </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Remember, every donation is effectively a pre-order. I really appreciate those of you going above &amp;beyond. It's because of you (literally) that this project is even able to continue moving forward! $1100 seems like a lot of money until you do the math on 12 photo shoots!!</div>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>My name is Kat, and I love donuts. I run a donut blog at <a href=""http://mewantdonut.tumblr.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">mewantdonut.tumblr.com</a></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>About a month ago, I began working on what I thought to be a fun little photo project with the goal of creating a themed pinup calendar. I love playing dress up and I love donuts, so I thought what the hay-- let's merge the ideas and make something more of this! </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Unfortunately, life has gotten in the way, as it so often does. Financial hardships have made continuing this project (with the intention of finishing before mid-December) a real challenge. So I am turning to the internet. The place where I keep all my invisible friends!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I humbly implore, oh friends across the globe, help me finish my project! It's sweet and sexy and colorful, will make a great addition to the office or gift for a friend! The photo shown above is an unedited sample of the sort of photos you can expect to find! Please help me make it better!!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Helping fund this calendar project is the only way it will be done for 2012. Although I'd love to finish it regardless, there is just no way I can afford the production costs. Since I am aware that my problems are pretty small-potatoes in the larger scheme of thing, I will also be donating 10% of the money I raise to the Global Hunger Project-- a charity aimed at ending global hunger <a href=""http://www.thp.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.thp.org/</a></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>What do I need? Well, part of the funding for this project will go to expenses such as props, wardrobe, other people's time and equipment, and most importantly DONUTS. The remaining funds will go to production costs, including the printing of the calendar, which is the most expensive part.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>What do you get?? Anyone who donates more than $18 will receive a calendar, once they're finished! Also, the largest donor before 11/18/11 gets the option of orchestrating one of our shoots-- you pick the featured donut and theme, and I will smile and make it happen!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Help get the word out! If I finish this project, and it turns out well, I would love to expand it next year into a bigger, far more awesome project. But I can't do it without help!</p>

<li>We will provide children with digital cameras and the skills to document their lives, their community, their families, their friends and their daily activities. This is their chance to say what they see!</li>
<li>Each week children will be asked to take photos with specific themes as part of the larger project. In the weekly tutoring sessions they will have the opportunity to discuss the pictures and to develop personal narratives, writing the story their photos tell. </li>
<li>We will invite local artists to visit tutoring sessions and to share their work, providing a positive role model and inspiration.</li>

While the project will provide a unique insight into their world, for the children this will be a life-changing experience and a valuable opportunity to express themselves through the camera lens.        How can people survive in a place like this? Despite its problems and lack of resources, Kibera is also a gigantic and incredible marketplace and an inspiring example of resilience. Business is being done all around and you can find here whatever you want! In Kibera, people dream about changing their community. People think outside of the box to find solutions for their needs.  Women work together to make clothes, jewellery and food which they sell in shops in the slum. Activists stand for people's right to live decent lives.    The Impact  ""Photography will help me in my future"".Through a participatory photography methodology, this project aims to give a voice to the children of Kibera and their underrepresented experiences. This is an opportunity for them to get actively involved in the community and to be seen and heard in their society and worldwide. By making photographs of their everyday life, children will develop a life-long skill and learn how to use photography as a mean of communication, advocacy and awareness raising. Photography is a universal language and it can act as a catalyst for greater international involvement and positive change. As speakers and writers, participants will use oral and written language to present their opinions and their views. As listeners, they will analyze experiences and ideas presented by others. By discussing their work, children will develop their sense of who they are in the world and will learn to appreciate various perspectives. With art, children can reflect and imagine. Photography will inspire curiosity and creativity, then children  can search for opportunities out of their neighborhood or can use their photography and story-telling skills to raise funds for the school or to promote new businesses. In capturing their life within the camera frame, they will be building, image by image, their self-confidence and a greater sense of control over their lives. The project will help children to understand that the life of young people in Kibera is a story worth telling and that there is a place for them, in their community, in their country, in the world.     What We NeedI spent some months designing the project and connecting with local partners. Now it is time to implement the project. To make it a reality, we need: 
Cameras and equipment (printer, paper, memory cards)
Website for online gallery
Postproduction, edition and printing of the work
Public exhibition of the final work
Museums and galleries visits - admission and transportation
Project coordination, monitoring and evaluation
Post cards and prints for the reward
Shipping expense
    With your support  
We will provide children with digital cameras and the skills to document their lives, their community, their families, their friends and their daily activities. This is their chance to say what they see!
Each week children will be asked to take photos with specific themes as part of the larger project. In the weekly tutoring sessions they will have the opportunity to discuss the pictures and to develop personal narratives, writing the story their photos tell. 
We will invite local artists to visit tutoring sessions and to share their work, providing a positive role model and inspiration.
Museum and galleries visits will be organized, giving children the opportunity to see original artwork, to reflect and to discover their potential.
Each children will build a body of photographic work and narratives - their own portfolio, which is the best way to evaluate the result of their participation.
Each week we will post on our official Facebook page the ""image of the week"", then you will be able to stay informed about the project and children can evaluate their progress.
The images created will be gathered in a photobook which will be launched with purpose of raising funds to feed back to the community.
We will present children's work at public exhibition in Kenya, inviting local policy-makers, youth organizations and major media. The culminating display of images will allow children to have their accomplishments recognised in a public forum, as well to see themselves as artists.

There are a lot of Ginkgo trees scattered besides houses and in valleys. Each family has several female Ginkgo trees, whose seeds are one of our main sources of income.</p><p>As a native, I grew up, I played in the wild Ginkgo forests. I began to photograph Ginkgos late last century. I learned my craft through apprenticeship to a disciple of a master traditional Chinese painter Shoutian Pan. My works have been published and exhibited internationally. And I have been editing and polishing the book for recent years.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1526300656/g4xxtjuh8dvrmgr4il93.jpg"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1526273724/bieq34jvub3ukql9kzcr.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1526274036/ihtwoqpt5pigzwif5t2n.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1526273927/csltftzykexi1npsuuwv.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1526273593/vwmdk89ehsesoc8qomi8.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1526296750/eygnpwrwn2dscz8brymq.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3>History</h3><p>God created the earth. Dinosaurs and Ginkgos flourished.

Old Buddhist monks liked to use walking sticks made of Ginkgo twigs, when they traveled as missionaries, they stuck their sticks into the soil inside the temple, where new trees would grow from these sticks. By this method Ginkgos spread to Korean peninsula and Japan about 1,500 years ago. About one thousand years later, Ginkgo nuts were carried from Japan to Holland, and the first Ginkgo tree in Europe grew. From Holland, Ginkgo was transplanted to other European countries and the U.S.A.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1526349294/gfmd9mksjz19ojsycnqz.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1526299259/xvlgplcoopypoth2tzcm.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1526299296/jzknawn4ekb0h9tlvxzq.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3>My Advisors</h3><p>The book delves deep and wide, besides wild Ginkgo sceneries, it encompasses history, wonders, legends, folklores, etc, supervised by top scientists, including:</p><p><strong>Zhiyan Zhou</strong>, academician, Research Professor of Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, one of the authoritative person in researching Ginkgo history.</p><p><strong>Shiyan Xing</strong>, professor of College of Forestry, Shangdong Agriculture University, vice chair of Ginkgo Branch of China Forestry Association.</p><p><strong>Zhaogen Zhang</strong>, historian, archeologist, former associate curator of Suzhou Museum, is currently the director of the Suzhou Institute of Archaeology, he has extensive knowledge on Chinese history.</p><p><strong>Sheung Wai</strong>,<strong> </strong>(Sherry) Chan,  linguist in English and Chinese, a bilingual poet living in Australia.</p><p><strong>Yusheng (Christopher) Liu</strong>,  former associate professor of Biology at Prairie View A&amp;M University, U.S.A.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1527690103/gjrcbphu9scvpc2y7rcq.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><i>Get to know more about the story of wild Ginkgos? </i> <i>Download 100+ pages of the Ginkgo picture book, by clicking the link:  </i></p><p><a href=""http://jmp.sh/6j2iXab"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>http://jmp.sh/6j2iXab</i></a></p><p><i>or you could get the whole ebook of 320 pages for 5 dollars by claiming any perk on the right. Discover and share wonders of Nature.</i></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530530219/bpz0npeecpi4j9cmw6cs.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3>Perks</h3><p>The book, hard cover, bilingual, in English and Chinese, 300 pages, 250+ color images, printed on 135 lb/200 gsm matt paper, 26 x 25 cm, /10.24 x 9.84 in. weight is about 4 lb.

I will show you around.</p><p> </p><h3>Q/A</h3><p>--Why the goal is set at $1000?</p><p>--Frankly, this amount is far from printing quality books. Publishing a book in China is quite different from that in the West. My publisher has already started the process, it has to pass the authority’s approval. And since I am not a star in China to guarantee the sale, I have to pay all the costs involved. I have been lucky to secure some rich friends to support this project. The proceeds here are supplementary. Increasing the volume of printing would reduce the cost per copy. So this is a win/win situation. Most of all, I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to a lot of people who have encouraged and supported me along the long long way.</p><p> </p><p>--Will the book be available in major bookstores in other parts of the world?</p><p>--Not sure, with ever expanding network of Chinese operated warehouses scattered in a lot of countries, and my Linkedin contact number grows fast, now exceeding 17k, I can easily handle myself. Moreover, I would be happy to make friends around the world.</p><p> </p><h3>I have been grateful</h3><p>In fact, a lot (hundreds) of people have offered their kind comments in shaping the present edition. I have been so grateful to them along the way. Here are a few.</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------</p><p> ‘What beautiful photos! Great to see Ginkgo in so many different habitats. I would strongly encourage you to publish the book.’</p><p>--Dr Mark Nesbitt, Curator, Economic Botany Collection Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, United Kingdom</p><p>May 08. 2016</p><p>--------------------------------------</p><p>'This manuscript offers a wonderful glimpse of the stately ginkgo from its origins in China. The author and photographer show adoration for this most ancient of trees. I was gifted a digital copy to peruse and shall cherish it. The images are touching and the prose poetic. Love the history and folk lore as well as popular references. A wonderful tribute to tree we have only sparingly planted in Nova Scotian cities and towns.'</p><p>--Ms. Marian Munro, Curator of Botany, Nova Scotia Museum, Canada</p><p>May 09, 2016</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------</p><p>‘I also showed it to our librarian, and we both agree that the photography and design are stunning. It is a very lyrical combination of imagery, poetry and information about the treasured Ginkgos in China.’</p><p>--Ms. Lugene B. Bruno, Curator of Art &amp; Senior Research Scholar, Hunt Institute for Botanical Documentation, Carnegie Mellon University, U.S.A</p><p>May 14, 2016</p><p>----------------------------------------------------</p><p>‘This is a beautiful book about a beautiful and intriguing plant.

You beautifully illustrate the interconnections between beauty and utility in this enduring relationship. The nature of this relationship over thousands of years is important for our understanding of a sustainable future. This is an important quest for you to continue.’</p><p>--Stephen Forbes, Director, Botanic Gardens of South Australia, Adelaide, Australia, Chair of the Council of Heads of Australian Botanic Gardens Australian</p><p>Aug. 21, 2016</p><p>----------------------------------</p><p>I just LOVE your book about ""everything Ginkgo!"" You have creatively woven fact with story, technical language with poetry, and amazing legends with dry history. The visuals are extraordinary and truly inspiring to the senses.</p><p>Many thanks for sharing and I know this book will be a huge success once published.</p><p>--Margaret (Meg) Lowman, Ph.D. Director of Global Initiatives/Lindsay Chair of Botany Institute for Biodiversity Science and Sustainability California Academy of Sciences</p><p>Oct. 02, 2016</p><p>----------------------------------</p><p>‘It is an impressive compilation of information, anecdotes, medical remedies and even recipes from all over China. Some of the illustrations are quite spectacular! It must have taken considerable time and effort to gather all the information and photos from across the country.

I always love the Ginkgo for its beauty and place in natural history. I wish we were able to grow them in Florida but, alas it is not happy here. I did grow them in Michigan and enjoyed their ancient appeal. Your book really captured their mystique in a thought provoking and artistic manner. I will of course forward any interest your way as, alas as mentioned Florida does not see the tree grown this far south in the sub tropics.’</p><p>--Steven J. Royer, Professor, Palm Beach State College, U.S.A.</p><p>Oct. 25, 2016</p><p>----------------------------------</p><p>‘The Ginkgo book looks beautiful and extremely interesting. Thanks so much for being the champion for conserving the amazing Ginkgo tree!’</p><p>--Simon Stuart, Chair, Species Survival Commission, the International Union for Conservation of Nature</p><p>Nov. 09, 2016</p><p>----------------------------------</p><p>‘It was fascinating to learn more about the unique history of the Ginkgos, as well as how they fit culturally in both artistic and botanical traditions in China. This was clearly a labor of love for you, and you should be applauded for a fine work . . . and for sharing it with others!!’ Dec. 07, 2016</p><p> 'The book continues to amaze me . . . a beautiful work of art, science, and spirituality.

You should be very proud of this book.’</p><p>--Rodney Honeycutt, Professor, Chairperson of Natural Science Division, Pepperdine University, U.S.A.</p><p>April 4, 2017</p><p>----------------------------------</p><p>‘I enjoyed reading the online version of your book on Ginkgos today. It is an amazing compilation of information, stories and folklore. The immense amount of work and attention to detail is obvious. There are places where the English translation could be improved. And perhaps somewhere you might want to address and dispute the widespread opinion among botanists that no verifiably wild Ginkgos exist.</p><p>Thank you so much for sharing your work with me. I hope that more people can become aware of your work.’</p><p>--Ross Clark, Professor Emeritus, Botany at Eastern Kentucky University, U.S.A.</p><p>Oct. 23, 2017</p><p>----------------------------------</p><p>‘The book is very beautiful, with a beautiful design, and the fact that you have edited it bilingually (in English and Chinese) gives it an air of superiority. ’</p><p>--Monica AXINI, Executive Manager, prof. at Monachus Group of Scientific Research and Ecological Education, Romania</p><p>Oct. 30, 2017</p><p>----------------------------------</p><p>‘What a delightful book.

K.</p><p>Nov. 08, 2017</p><p>----------------------------------</p><p><i>‘Gingko:The Living Fossil </i>is lovely and important. Congratulations on such a special exploration of a tree and its culture. Your obsession is a good one. It is important, because it reminds us of something most people seem to have forgotten, that nature has shaped human culture since the beginning, even as human culture increasingly dominated nature. Your work provides a gateway for us to get back to where we need to be. Keep exploring, Jimmy!’</p><p>--Vance G. Martin, President, WILD Foundation, Chairman, Wilderness Specialist Group (IUCN/WCPA)</p><p>Nov. 20, 2017</p><p>----------------------------------</p><p>‘This is a very beautiful book.

Congratulations on your achievement and thank you for sharing these trees' stories.’</p><p>--Sophia Shaw, Adjunct Professor of Social Impact at Kellogg School of Management, Former President &amp; CEO of Chicago Botanic Garden</p><p>Nov. 26, 2017</p><p>----------------------------------</p><p>‘My first reaction was, what a wonderful production! I will look forward to reading it.’</p><p>--Chris Cleal, Head of Botany at Amgueddfa Cymru - National Museum Wales, U. K.</p><p>Dec. 06, 2017</p><p>----------------------------------</p><p>‘Like the redwoods of California, China's Ginkgo's are ancient forest survivors that have always inspired awe for their beauty and longevity. What Jimmy Shen has also captured, though, are the charm and rich cultural history of these golden, graceful trees in their native land.’</p><p>--Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club,U.S.A., via Jim Bradbury, Communications Specialist, Sierra Club National</p><p>Dec. 20, 2017</p><p>----------------------------------</p><p>‘The book is very nice!

There are a lot of Ginkgo trees scattered besides houses and in valleys. Each family has several female Ginkgo trees, whose seeds are one of our main sources of income.As a native, I grew up, I played in the wild Ginkgo forests. I began to photograph Ginkgos late last century. I learned my craft through apprenticeship to a disciple of a master traditional Chinese painter Shoutian Pan. My works have been published and exhibited internationally. And I have been editing and polishing the book for recent years.HistoryGod created the earth. Dinosaurs and Ginkgos flourished. After the biological mass extinction 65 million years ago, plus the Quaternary glaciers which swept across the planet 2 million years ago, most forms of animals and plants disappeared. One species of Ginkgo tree survived in sheltered mountainous areas in east China. I am lucky enough to be a native.In 1989, at Yi Ma Formation of Henan Province, China, a team of paleontologists led by Zhiyan Zhou (my advisor) and Bole Zhang unearthed some Ginkgo fossils, that they later traced back 170 million years--the oldest Ginkgo fossils found to date. Following is their leaf and seed patterns:Because of their straight trunks and extraordinary shapes, Ginkgo trees were often planted in front of temples, lending an atmosphere of awe and solemnity. Old Buddhist monks liked to use walking sticks made of Ginkgo twigs, when they traveled as missionaries, they stuck their sticks into the soil inside the temple, where new trees would grow from these sticks. By this method Ginkgos spread to Korean peninsula and Japan about 1,500 years ago. About one thousand years later, Ginkgo nuts were carried from Japan to Holland, and the first Ginkgo tree in Europe grew. From Holland, Ginkgo was transplanted to other European countries and the U.S.A.My AdvisorsThe book delves deep and wide, besides wild Ginkgo sceneries, it encompasses history, wonders, legends, folklores, etc, supervised by top scientists, including:Zhiyan Zhou, academician, Research Professor of Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, one of the authoritative person in researching Ginkgo history.Shiyan Xing, professor of College of Forestry, Shangdong Agriculture University, vice chair of Ginkgo Branch of China Forestry Association.Zhaogen Zhang, historian, archeologist, former associate curator of Suzhou Museum, is currently the director of the Suzhou Institute of Archaeology, he has extensive knowledge on Chinese history.Sheung Wai, (Sherry) Chan,  linguist in English and Chinese, a bilingual poet living in Australia.Yusheng (Christopher) Liu,  former associate professor of Biology at Prairie View A&M University, U.S.A.Get to know more about the story of wild Ginkgos?  Download 100+ pages of the Ginkgo picture book, by clicking the link:  http://jmp.sh/6j2iXabor you could get the whole ebook of 320 pages for 5 dollars by claiming any perk on the right. Discover and share wonders of Nature.PerksThe book, hard cover, bilingual, in English and Chinese, 300 pages, 250+ color images, printed on 135 lb/200 gsm matt paper, 26 x 25 cm, /10.24 x 9.84 in. weight is about 4 lb. In order to keep the weight plus package under 2 kg, (which is the most convenient transportation packet in most countries), I may reduce some pages in the printing edition. All perks may add shipping charges, ranging from $2 and up. As the book is heavy, I will ship in lot by sea to my agents' warehouses in your country/continent, they will dispatch to you individually. Canvas style pigment printsHere are the 4 canvas style pigment prints. Each image derived from a millennium-old Ginkgo, then computer enhanced.ABCDToursThere are too much to be expressed by any words or images, so the book only serves as a taster. It would be my pleasure to welcome you to see wild Ginkgos here in the Tianmu Mountains, east China, where I am living. I will show you around. Q/A--Why the goal is set at $1000?--Frankly, this amount is far from printing quality books. Publishing a book in China is quite different from that in the West. My publisher has already started the process, it has to pass the authority’s approval. And since I am not a star in China to guarantee the sale, I have to pay all the costs involved. I have been lucky to secure some rich friends to support this project. The proceeds here are supplementary. Increasing the volume of printing would reduce the cost per copy. So this is a win/win situation. Most of all, I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to a lot of people who have encouraged and supported me along the long long way. --Will the book be available in major bookstores in other parts of the world?--Not sure, with ever expanding network of Chinese operated warehouses scattered in a lot of countries, and my Linkedin contact number grows fast, now exceeding 17k, I can easily handle myself. Moreover, I would be happy to make friends around the world. I have been gratefulIn fact, a lot (hundreds) of people have offered their kind comments in shaping the present edition. I have been so grateful to them along the way. Here are a few.----------------------------------------------------- ‘What beautiful photos! Great to see Ginkgo in so many different habitats. I would strongly encourage you to publish the book.’--Dr Mark Nesbitt, Curator, Economic Botany Collection Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, United KingdomMay 08. 2016--------------------------------------'This manuscript offers a wonderful glimpse of the stately ginkgo from its origins in China. The author and photographer show adoration for this most ancient of trees. I was gifted a digital copy to peruse and shall cherish it. The images are touching and the prose poetic. Love the history and folk lore as well as popular references. A wonderful tribute to tree we have only sparingly planted in Nova Scotian cities and towns.'--Ms. Marian Munro, Curator of Botany, Nova Scotia Museum, CanadaMay 09, 2016-----------------------------------------------------‘I also showed it to our librarian, and we both agree that the photography and design are stunning. It is a very lyrical combination of imagery, poetry and information about the treasured Ginkgos in China.’--Ms. Lugene B. Bruno, Curator of Art & Senior Research Scholar, Hunt Institute for Botanical Documentation, Carnegie Mellon University, U.S.AMay 14, 2016----------------------------------------------------‘This is a beautiful book about a beautiful and intriguing plant. The photographs and stories are inspiring, and add to our enjoyment of the fascinating Ginkgo. Jimmy Shen has created a work of art and science!’--Tim Entwisle, Professor, Director and Chief Executive of Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria, AustraliaJune 19, 2016-------------------------------------------------------‘This is an amazing book that will find its way onto everyone's bookshelf who is interested in Ginkgos. It has fabulous images of Ginkgos in the wild and cultivation.’--Dr. Tony Kirkham, Head of the arboretum at the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew, United KingdomJune 29, 2016-------------------------------------------------------‘Your exploration of Ginkgo biloba and the relationship between Chinese people and this remarkable tree through outstanding photographs, careful documentation and poetry is very important. You beautifully illustrate the interconnections between beauty and utility in this enduring relationship. The nature of this relationship over thousands of years is important for our understanding of a sustainable future. This is an important quest for you to continue.’--Stephen Forbes, Director, Botanic Gardens of South Australia, Adelaide, Australia, Chair of the Council of Heads of Australian Botanic Gardens AustralianAug. 21, 2016----------------------------------I just LOVE your book about ""everything Ginkgo!"" You have creatively woven fact with story, technical language with poetry, and amazing legends with dry history. The visuals are extraordinary and truly inspiring to the senses.Many thanks for sharing and I know this book will be a huge success once published.--Margaret (Meg) Lowman, Ph.D. Director of Global Initiatives/Lindsay Chair of Botany Institute for Biodiversity Science and Sustainability California Academy of SciencesOct. 02, 2016----------------------------------‘It is an impressive compilation of information, anecdotes, medical remedies and even recipes from all over China. Some of the illustrations are quite spectacular! It must have taken considerable time and effort to gather all the information and photos from across the country. The book is a valuable resource for anyone wanting to know about Ginkgo and its long heritage. Great job!’--Prof. Stephen McLoughlin, Swedish Museum of Natural History, SwedenOct. 12, 2016--------------------------------------------- ‘This is a beautiful and wonderfully complete body of work. I will take time to go through and read thoroughly, it truly deserves time to absorb and reflect. I would love to see this work being showcased in our garden and to be enjoyed by others who appreciate the nature and lore of Ginkgo.’--Kevin Frediani, Inverewe Property Manager at the National Trust for Scotland, Honorary Lecturer Urban Agriculture, The University of Nottingham U.K.Oct. 20, 2016-------------------------------------------------------‘Concerning your book, it is a delightful balance of art and information. I always love the Ginkgo for its beauty and place in natural history. I wish we were able to grow them in Florida but, alas it is not happy here. I did grow them in Michigan and enjoyed their ancient appeal. Your book really captured their mystique in a thought provoking and artistic manner. I will of course forward any interest your way as, alas as mentioned Florida does not see the tree grown this far south in the sub tropics.’--Steven J. Royer, Professor, Palm Beach State College, U.S.A.Oct. 25, 2016----------------------------------‘The Ginkgo book looks beautiful and extremely interesting. Thanks so much for being the champion for conserving the amazing Ginkgo tree!’--Simon Stuart, Chair, Species Survival Commission, the International Union for Conservation of NatureNov. 09, 2016----------------------------------‘It was fascinating to learn more about the unique history of the Ginkgos, as well as how they fit culturally in both artistic and botanical traditions in China. This was clearly a labor of love for you, and you should be applauded for a fine work . . . and for sharing it with others!!’ Dec. 07, 2016 'The book continues to amaze me . . . a beautiful work of art, science, and spirituality. Well  done!!'  July, 10, 2018-- J. Eric Smith, President and CEO, TREE Fund, U.S.A.----------------------------------'Your work is absolutely beautiful! I am so grateful to you for sharing it with me.'--Katie Frohardt, Executive Director, Wild Earth AlliesDec. 07, 2016----------------------------------‘This is absolutely beautiful. The photographs are fantastic. You should be very proud of this book.’--Rodney Honeycutt, Professor, Chairperson of Natural Science Division, Pepperdine University, U.S.A.April 4, 2017----------------------------------‘I enjoyed reading the online version of your book on Ginkgos today. It is an amazing compilation of information, stories and folklore. The immense amount of work and attention to detail is obvious. There are places where the English translation could be improved. And perhaps somewhere you might want to address and dispute the widespread opinion among botanists that no verifiably wild Ginkgos exist.Thank you so much for sharing your work with me. I hope that more people can become aware of your work.’--Ross Clark, Professor Emeritus, Botany at Eastern Kentucky University, U.S.A.Oct. 23, 2017----------------------------------‘The book is very beautiful, with a beautiful design, and the fact that you have edited it bilingually (in English and Chinese) gives it an air of superiority. ’--Monica AXINI, Executive Manager, prof. at Monachus Group of Scientific Research and Ecological Education, RomaniaOct. 30, 2017----------------------------------‘What a delightful book. Not only the trees - but I am fascinated by the uses of wood and timber and the way the Gingko woods are managed.’--Ian Rotherham, Editor of Arboricultural Journal, Professor at Sheffield Hallam University, U. K.Nov. 08, 2017----------------------------------‘Gingko:The Living Fossil is lovely and important. Congratulations on such a special exploration of a tree and its culture. Your obsession is a good one. It is important, because it reminds us of something most people seem to have forgotten, that nature has shaped human culture since the beginning, even as human culture increasingly dominated nature. Your work provides a gateway for us to get back to where we need to be. Keep exploring, Jimmy!’--Vance G. Martin, President, WILD Foundation, Chairman, Wilderness Specialist Group (IUCN/WCPA)Nov. 20, 2017----------------------------------‘This is a very beautiful book. Thank you for sharing it with me. I particularly like the text along with the photographs, including the list of the 3,000-year-old trees and the couple trees. Congratulations on your achievement and thank you for sharing these trees' stories.’--Sophia Shaw, Adjunct Professor of Social Impact at Kellogg School of Management, Former President & CEO of Chicago Botanic GardenNov. 26, 2017----------------------------------‘My first reaction was, what a wonderful production! I will look forward to reading it.’--Chris Cleal, Head of Botany at Amgueddfa Cymru - National Museum Wales, U. K.Dec. 06, 2017----------------------------------‘Like the redwoods of California, China's Ginkgo's are ancient forest survivors that have always inspired awe for their beauty and longevity. What Jimmy Shen has also captured, though, are the charm and rich cultural history of these golden, graceful trees in their native land.’--Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club,U.S.A., via Jim Bradbury, Communications Specialist, Sierra Club NationalDec. 20, 2017----------------------------------‘The book is very nice!

<p>""The search for homeplace is the mythical search for the <em>axis mundi</em>, for a center, for some place to stand, for something to hang on to."" -Lucy Lippard, from <em>The Lure of the Local</em></p>
<p>Home, for me, will always be a 1200-acre farm in the Red River Valley of eastern North Dakota.  Its original 160 acres were homesteaded in 1884 by my great-great grandfather, a Norwegian immigrant.  My parents are now the fourth, and last, consecutive generation to work our land, as my siblings and I (like so many other young people) have all moved away to pursue other careers.  These circumstances provided me with the impetus to document our farm and its origins in Norway at this critical juncture.  I combine my images with materials from my family’s archive, such as documents and snapshots, to create a rich multi-layered narrative.  Just as different layers of texts intermingle on reused ancient manuscript pages, the history of our farm is marked again and again on the land as a palimpsest. As world populations shift from agrarian to urban lifestyles, our small family farm is only one amongst many that are approaching a crossroads.  What will happen to them?  Who will maintain these traditions and what does this tradition mean?</p>
<p>After six years of working on this photographic project, “Homeplace” will be published by Daylight in Fall 2013—my first book!  And because this is my first book, the publishers have asked that I cover part of the publishing costs.  I cannot raise these funds alone and am asking for your help.  Please donate and spread the word to make this book come to life!<br/><br/></p>
<p><strong>Proposed Book Specs &amp; Your Contributions:</strong><br/> Clothbound, hardcover book<br/> Approximately 160 pages, with color and black and white photographs and scholarly texts<br/> Size:  8x10 inches<br/><br/> Your contributions will help pay for the publishing costs, and in exchange I am offering a number of exciting rewards, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>thank you postcards with an image from the book</li>
<li>mass-produced and hand-printed limited edition prints in a variety of sizes</li>
<li>signed and numbered copies of the book, available only through me</li>
<li>and a chance to commission me for a custom photograph!</li>
</ul><p>Think of this campaign as a pre-publication sale.  By purchasing now, you have the chance to get one of the first 500 copies of the book and the same hand-printed, limited edition black and white gelatin silver prints as found in the collections of the National Museum of Photography in Copenhagen, Minot State University in North Dakota, the University of Iowa (Iowa City), and private collections throughout the United States, Denmark, and France.  Please note that shipping is included with all perks, as is a thank you on my website.</p>
<p>Any additional funds I raise will go towards upgrading the book, such as using a higher quality paper, different colored endsheets, etc. </p>
<p>This book will allow me to share this important project with a wider audience.  I’ve chosen to work with <a href=""http://www.daylightmagazine.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Daylight</a>, instead of self-publishing, because they are a respected publisher with a long history of supporting smart, conscientious, and socially engaged projects.  Plus, they have a distribution partnership with D.A.P.

<p>I know that not everyone can contribute financially--you can help by spreading the word &amp; sharing my Indiegogo campaign with others.  I'm especially interested in generating greater interest via online, social, &amp; print media.  I will also be accepting bulk orders of books for gifts or resale.  Please email me (sarah@sarahchristianson.com) for further information.  Also, don't hesitate to contact me if you would prefer to make an arrangement offline.  Any support that you can offer as I undertake this endeavor will be much appreciated!</p>

""The search for homeplace is the mythical search for the axis mundi, for a center, for some place to stand, for something to hang on to."" -Lucy Lippard, from The Lure of the Local
Home, for me, will always be a 1200-acre farm in the Red River Valley of eastern North Dakota.  Its original 160 acres were homesteaded in 1884 by my great-great grandfather, a Norwegian immigrant.  My parents are now the fourth, and last, consecutive generation to work our land, as my siblings and I (like so many other young people) have all moved away to pursue other careers.  These circumstances provided me with the impetus to document our farm and its origins in Norway at this critical juncture.  I combine my images with materials from my family’s archive, such as documents and snapshots, to create a rich multi-layered narrative.  Just as different layers of texts intermingle on reused ancient manuscript pages, the history of our farm is marked again and again on the land as a palimpsest. As world populations shift from agrarian to urban lifestyles, our small family farm is only one amongst many that are approaching a crossroads.  What will happen to them?  Who will maintain these traditions and what does this tradition mean?
After six years of working on this photographic project, “Homeplace” will be published by Daylight in Fall 2013—my first book!  And because this is my first book, the publishers have asked that I cover part of the publishing costs.  I cannot raise these funds alone and am asking for your help.  Please donate and spread the word to make this book come to life!
Proposed Book Specs & Your Contributions: Clothbound, hardcover book Approximately 160 pages, with color and black and white photographs and scholarly texts Size:  8x10 inches Your contributions will help pay for the publishing costs, and in exchange I am offering a number of exciting rewards, including:

thank you postcards with an image from the book
mass-produced and hand-printed limited edition prints in a variety of sizes
signed and numbered copies of the book, available only through me
and a chance to commission me for a custom photograph!
Think of this campaign as a pre-publication sale.  By purchasing now, you have the chance to get one of the first 500 copies of the book and the same hand-printed, limited edition black and white gelatin silver prints as found in the collections of the National Museum of Photography in Copenhagen, Minot State University in North Dakota, the University of Iowa (Iowa City), and private collections throughout the United States, Denmark, and France.  Please note that shipping is included with all perks, as is a thank you on my website.
Any additional funds I raise will go towards upgrading the book, such as using a higher quality paper, different colored endsheets, etc. 
This book will allow me to share this important project with a wider audience.  I’ve chosen to work with Daylight, instead of self-publishing, because they are a respected publisher with a long history of supporting smart, conscientious, and socially engaged projects.  Plus, they have a distribution partnership with D.A.P. (Distributed Art Publishers), “the world’s top distributor of art books.” 
I know that not everyone can contribute financially--you can help by spreading the word & sharing my Indiegogo campaign with others.  I'm especially interested in generating greater interest via online, social, & print media.  I will also be accepting bulk orders of books for gifts or resale.  Please email me (sarah@sarahchristianson.com) for further information.  Also, don't hesitate to contact me if you would prefer to make an arrangement offline.  Any support that you can offer as I undertake this endeavor will be much appreciated!
About the ArtistSarah Christianson (b. 1982) grew up on a four-generation family farm near Cummings, North Dakota. Immersed in that vast expanse of the Great Plains, she developed a strong affinity for the landscape and the stories it contains. This experience has had a profound effect on her work, as she enjoys creating narratives about place and personal experience through time, historical research, and the landscape. Her work has been exhibited internationally and can be found in the collections of several institutions in the Midwest and the National Museum of Photography in Copenhagen, Denmark. She received a BFA in photography at Minnesota State University Moorhead in 2005 and an MFA in photography from the University of Minnesota in 2009.  Since then, she has been living in the San Francisco Bay Area where she teaches photography at City College of San Francisco, volunteers at RayKo Photo Center, and remains an active member of the Society for Photographic Education.

<h3>NATIVO at a glance</h3>
<p>NATIVO has been conceived by 3 young creative minds. Here is who they are and what they think about the project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lupo Cordero, a Panamanian photographer and visual artist: ""For me the NATIVO project is an introspective journey, one in the search for a shift in the current parameters of society.""</li>
<li>Alberto Rossini, an Italian photographer specialised in nature and documentary photography: ""The NATIVO project is in my opinion a unique attempt to open a positive discussion on diversity and social integration.""</li>
<li>Harvey Wilson, an English designer and videographer specialised in creative story-telling: ""The NATIVO project is an incredible and unique opportunity to capture film, photos and stories that have never been collated in this way before.""</li>
</ul>
<p>The NATIVO project is an 100% self-funded ethnological visual study about Panama’s 7 indigenous nationalities. It's a visual companion to the memory of these populations, a photographic archive that recounts the processes and problematic transformations that they face in relation to their environment and the rest of the mainstream society in Panama.</p>
<p>With this campaign we are looking for funds that can help us enable a future positive impact on those communities. We are going to collect all the images and stories that we find along the way and make a book that will be hopefully spread across the globe. We also plan to gather a series of video interviews as a snapshot of day-to-day life and personal stories all of which will be combined into a video documentary.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>How can you help &amp; What you get</h3>
<p>In order for us to make the NATIVO project possible we need your help. We are looking for funding to help cover the costs of gathering all of the content but more importantly the capital to produce the first batch of photo books.</p>
<p>We aim to raise € 7.000, of which 15% will be used to cover the expenses while shooting in Panama and the rest 85% will be entirely used to print the book in as many copies as possible.</p>
<p>We are incredibly passionate about this project so it’s going to happen regardless of how much funding we receive. We hope others can see the value in what we’re trying to achieve and feel inspired to help us in our vision. So far we have covered part of the expenses ourselves, and have only been using the equipment and resources we already have in hand, yet to reach the next level, we reach out to you to help us make NATIVO a reality. The amount of funds that we receive thanks to your support will directly affect the scale and impact that this project has.</p>
<p>We invite you to step in as a contributor, and by doing so we are offering you a wide set of perks from a simple “Thank you!” message to premium prints and limited edition books. Please check them out!</p>

<h2>Our story</h2>
<p>
		At the end of April this year, I will be travelling to Dharamsala in Northern India to photograph Tibetans in exile.
		During a 4 months stay I am planning on documenting who are the Tibetan refugee more than 50 years after the invasion of Tibet.
	</p>
<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p>
		What is needed is :
		</p>
<ul>
<li>1800 $ for Black and whites negatives</li>
<li>350 $ to have both my camera`s check out</li>
<li>290 $ for a waterproof case</li>
</ul>
		Total 2440 $ rounded up at 2500 $</div><div>
<br/><p>What you get depending on your donations is detailed here on the right. Keep in Mind that everything is made in limited edition and with love. I will update pictures of some of the perks as soon as available. Just remember, you can give whatever amount you see fit and if you think you can give in some other way just contact MAc.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Why this project ?</h2>
<div>1959 marks the Triumph of the Cuban revolution (see my work on Cuba <a href=""http://www.maclupus.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""maclupus.net"">here</a>) but also the flight of the Dalai Lama to India following the invasion of Tibet by the Chinese People Liberation Army (PLA). As with the Cuban revolution, many thought that the occupation of Tibet would not last and that sooner than later ""things would go back to Normal"". More than 50 years later, the third generation of Tibetans born in exile still has not set foot in a country now only remembered by refugees in their eighties. Can an exile last more than 50 years ? How long before the new generation start to define themselves as Indian, Nepalis, Swiss or Canadians? What effect has the continuous flow of refugee on the community living ""outside"" Tibet for half a century ?</div>
<div>Those are some of the questions behind the ""Tibetans in Exile"" project and Dharamsala and its surrounding. (the second biggest concentration of Tibetan refugees in the world and the location of the government in exile)<br/>
</div>
<div>This is the first step of a long term project that will expand in the year to come.</div>

Our story

		At the end of April this year, I will be travelling to Dharamsala in Northern India to photograph Tibetans in exile.
		During a 4 months stay I am planning on documenting who are the Tibetan refugee more than 50 years after the invasion of Tibet.
	
What We Need & What You Get

		What is needed is :
		

1800 $ for Black and whites negatives
350 $ to have both my camera`s check out
290 $ for a waterproof case

		Total 2440 $ rounded up at 2500 $
What you get depending on your donations is detailed here on the right. Keep in Mind that everything is made in limited edition and with love. I will update pictures of some of the perks as soon as available. Just remember, you can give whatever amount you see fit and if you think you can give in some other way just contact MAc.

Why this project ?
1959 marks the Triumph of the Cuban revolution (see my work on Cuba here) but also the flight of the Dalai Lama to India following the invasion of Tibet by the Chinese People Liberation Army (PLA). As with the Cuban revolution, many thought that the occupation of Tibet would not last and that sooner than later ""things would go back to Normal"". More than 50 years later, the third generation of Tibetans born in exile still has not set foot in a country now only remembered by refugees in their eighties. Can an exile last more than 50 years ? How long before the new generation start to define themselves as Indian, Nepalis, Swiss or Canadians? What effect has the continuous flow of refugee on the community living ""outside"" Tibet for half a century ?
Those are some of the questions behind the ""Tibetans in Exile"" project and Dharamsala and its surrounding. (the second biggest concentration of Tibetan refugees in the world and the location of the government in exile)

This is the first step of a long term project that will expand in the year to come.

Pourquoi ce projet ?

1959 marque  le triomphe de la rÃ©volution cubaine (voir
mon travail sur Cuba ici) mais aussi la fuite du Dalai Lama en Inde aprÃ¨s
l'invasion du Tibet par l'ArmÃ©e
Populaire de LibÃ©ration Chinoise (APL). Comme dans le cas de Cuba, beaucoup
pensaient que l'occupation du Tibet n'allait pas durer et que les choses
rentreraient dans l'ordre. Cinquante ans plus tard, plusieurs gÃ©nÃ©rations de
TibÃ©tains, nÃ©s en exil, n'ont toujours pas remis les pieds dans un pays
dont seulement les
anciens se rappellent. Est-ce que l'exil peut durer plus de 50 ans ? Qu'est-ce que cela veux dire aujourd'hui
d'Ãªtre un tibÃ©tain en exil ? Combien de temps avant que la nouvelle gÃ©nÃ©ration ne se dÃ©finisse comme indienne, nÃ©palaise, suisse ou canadienne ? Quel est l'effet du flot continu de rÃ©fugiÃ©s sur une communautÃ© qui vit en dehors du Tibet depuis un demi siÃ¨cle ?
Ces questions, parmi
d'autres sont au centre du projet ''TibÃ©tains en Exil'' et Dharamsala et ses
alentours constituent le point de dÃ©part d'un projet Ã  long terme consacrÃ© Ã  la
diaspora TibÃ©taine.

<p><b><i>Some reviews of the film:</i></b></p>
<p>“The Cockettes” is an engaging tribute to a theatrical troupe that was the sensation of the late 1960s and early 1970s hippie movement in San Francisco. They were, as John Waters describes them, “hippie acid freak drag queens,” and this sympathetic, straight-ahead look at “people who were allowed to live at the end of their imagination” is a charming and nostalgic revisiting of a lost corner of recent cultural history… This comprehensive and charming film not only recalls those days exactly, it also manages the wonderful trick of taking us back there along with it. –Kenneth Turan, The Los Angeles Times</p>
<p>A flamboyant piece of hippie history gets its due in Bill Weber and David Weissman’s loving look at the San Francisco drugs-and-drag theatre troupe. The filmmakers capture the spirit of life in a late-sixties commune as well as the Cockettes’ hallucinogenic romps—performances foisted on audiences who were in the mood for wigged-out frivolity. With its archival footage and hilariously frank interviews, the movie makes for a ragtag portrait of a cultural moment when free expression reigned supreme. — Bruce Diones, The New Yorker</p>
<p>A fascinatingly detailed snapshot of the flamboyant outer reaches of countercultural San Francisco in the hippie years and an emotional celebration of diversity, liberation, sexual anarchy and fabulousness, “The Cockettes” joyously re-creates the brief but resplendent reign of the legendary freakadelic drag troupe… . The climate of all-embracing acceptance, blurred sexual lines, joyful transgression, rebellion and freedom comes through with warmth, humor and nostalgia. — David Rooney, Daily Variety</p>

<p><strong><i>STAIRWAY TO PARADISE</i></strong><br/><br/>I came to San Francisco in the fall of 1968 with my camera in hand.

</div></div>","Hey! I’m Mike. Here's my storyFor a decade I’ve molded my life around travel and photography. How? I’ve embodied frugalism to save money; moved abroad to explore new continents; and bargained hard to pry extra vacation time (without pay) from employers.  Earlier this year I launched my travel/photography website and took a plunge: I quit my job and sold all my things to pursue writing and photography projects full-time.One of my dreams has always been to publish a photography book. And since I began travelling, I've been fascinated by people whose livelihoods are difficult, dangerous, rare, strange, or just different.   So with your help I hope to publish this book showcasing these interesting people and professions.   The world, at work. ________________________________________________________ ** Update: We did it! The book is shipping now. If you haven't ordered yours yet, please do now before this limited edition book sells out. ** Update Sept 2017: IGG has decided to charge exorbitant fees for non-US citizens (I don't exaggerate; last payout I lost 70% to fees.

</span></p><p><strong>HOW DID I START TO WORK ON THIS?</strong></p>
<p>A couple of years back, I
happened to visit Vrindavan, a holy city in Uttar Pradesh, in India. A chance visit to a shelter home opened my eyes to the world of
a widow. What I saw affected me deeply and will remain with me
for the rest of my life.<b> </b><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">I saw a dark room with more than a dozen beds

<p style=""display: inline !important;""><span>Who were these women, where did they come

<p><b>ABOUT THE PROJECT: </b></p>
<p>It’s been three years since I embarked on the journey of taking photos in many shelter homes across Vrindavan and
Varanasi. Over the months I compiled this into a photo essay, which was able to generate a lot of curiosity and awareness on the subject. Friends, acquaintances, complete strangers wrote back to me, overwhelmed by the story. The project found much love and appreciation and was part of the prestigious Goa International Photo Festival in 2015. The story has since been published in various magazines and newspapers. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460996073/IMG_010_combo_pt6qa0.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;""><b>I STRONGLY FELT THE NEED TO COMPILE THIS INTO A PHOTO BOOK.</b></span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">Even though I had made progress with the work, the need to compile this into a book kept me pushing further. And then during a shoot in Vrindavan,</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;""> a woman asked me sharply ‘why do you keep asking us for our
stories, what good will this be, will it really help us?’</span><br/></p>
<p>The question really made me determined to know more. Why were the widows meted out such harsh treatment? Was it simply because the society was superstitious about widows bringing bad luck or was there a bigger conspiracy behind all this? What is their current situation and what is being done to improve their condition? I decided
to dig deeper and what came tumbling out were unbelievable facts and a deeper
conspiracy behind their abandonment, tracing back to more than 200 years, with its root in Bengal. </p>
<p>There
is a huge need to create more awareness on the subject. Even today, hundreds of
widows are forced to leave home and end up in shelter homes and the streets of Varanasi
and Vrindavan. Denied of dignity, they lead lives of utter penury and
humiliation, till death decides to claim them.</p>

He and his team are a source of huge inspiration with the kind of work they have been doing for the welfare of the widows. Needless to say, without his help it would have been impossible to even have access to the innumerable shelter homes that I have had the good fortune of visiting and documenting. </span></p>
<p>I am also very thankful to Dr. V. Mohini Giri, the founder and director of Guild of service and the ex- chairperson of the National Commission for Women. She has been doing groundbreaking work for the wefare of young widows and her thorough research has helped me compile this book. I am also very thankful to Ms. Meera Khanna of the Guild of Service for her inputs on the book.</p>

</div></div>","WHO IS DURGA?
Is she just the goddess who we have celebrated for ages as the
embodiment of feminine power? Is she not
present in every woman, rich, poor, young and old? Then why do we love one and humiliate the other?DURGA is a study on gender bias and extreme discrimination
against widows in India. It lays bare the hypocrisy of a society that chooses to shower adulation on one
woman and extreme humiliation on another, depending on who suits its selfish needs.


HOW DID I START TO WORK ON THIS?
A couple of years back, I
happened to visit Vrindavan, a holy city in Uttar Pradesh, in India. A chance visit to a shelter home opened my eyes to the world of
a widow. What I saw affected me deeply and will remain with me
for the rest of my life. I saw a dark room with more than a dozen beds
lined up against both the walls. There on the beds sat old and ailing women, in tattered white saris, with blank look in their eyes.
Who were these women, where did they come
from, where was their family…many questions crowded my head. I tried talking to them. A few of them poured their hearts out, a few didn't remember. But what started out as a one-to-one talk that day, urged me to
go back to Vrindavan again and again.



ABOUT THE PROJECT: 
It’s been three years since I embarked on the journey of taking photos in many shelter homes across Vrindavan and
Varanasi. Over the months I compiled this into a photo essay, which was able to generate a lot of curiosity and awareness on the subject. Friends, acquaintances, complete strangers wrote back to me, overwhelmed by the story. The project found much love and appreciation and was part of the prestigious Goa International Photo Festival in 2015. The story has since been published in various magazines and newspapers. 


I STRONGLY FELT THE NEED TO COMPILE THIS INTO A PHOTO BOOK.
Even though I had made progress with the work, the need to compile this into a book kept me pushing further. And then during a shoot in Vrindavan, a woman asked me sharply ‘why do you keep asking us for our
stories, what good will this be, will it really help us?’
The question really made me determined to know more. Why were the widows meted out such harsh treatment? Was it simply because the society was superstitious about widows bringing bad luck or was there a bigger conspiracy behind all this? What is their current situation and what is being done to improve their condition? I decided
to dig deeper and what came tumbling out were unbelievable facts and a deeper
conspiracy behind their abandonment, tracing back to more than 200 years, with its root in Bengal. 
There
is a huge need to create more awareness on the subject. Even today, hundreds of
widows are forced to leave home and end up in shelter homes and the streets of Varanasi
and Vrindavan. Denied of dignity, they lead lives of utter penury and
humiliation, till death decides to claim them.






WHO WE ARE AND HOW WE TOOK THIS AHEAD.
Last year I finished photographing and began working on the photo book with a team of writers, editors and documentary film makers. We are a small group of people from different professional backgrounds, but with the common love to do challenging visual and communication projects. Rakhi Biswas, a fashion stylist by profession, plays the role of Durga and the protagonist in the story. Madhurpriya Choudhry Sinha, co-author of the book has written award winning advertising campaigns and scripts shows for television. She brought out the book The Chowfins of Garwhal, on Chinese tea experts in the mid 19th Century. Ayan nandi, a documentary filmmaker and photographer, helped me with documenting many an interview at the shelter homes. Subinoy Das is a passionate photographer and a documentary filmmaker. With his help I was able to produce a small documentary film about the entire project. Raghav Panda is a graphic designer and an expert on image editing.
I am hugely indebted to Dr. Bindeshwar Pathak, the founder and Director of Sulabh International Social Service Organisation, for his continuous support. He and his team are a source of huge inspiration with the kind of work they have been doing for the welfare of the widows. Needless to say, without his help it would have been impossible to even have access to the innumerable shelter homes that I have had the good fortune of visiting and documenting. 
I am also very thankful to Dr. V. Mohini Giri, the founder and director of Guild of service and the ex- chairperson of the National Commission for Women. She has been doing groundbreaking work for the wefare of young widows and her thorough research has helped me compile this book. I am also very thankful to Ms. Meera Khanna of the Guild of Service for her inputs on the book.

SPECIFICATIONS OF THE PHOTO BOOK
The work now is in its final stages and its launch, scheduled for July 2016 will be accompanied by an exhibition in India. But like many photographers, I have decided to opt for self-publishing. Which basically means,
the onus to print, publish, distribute and market the book lies completely with
my humble team and me. The book will be printed in 4 colours, will be hardbound, with roughly 90
pages. It will have approximately 120 black and white and colour photographs.








DURGA NEEDS YOUR SUPPORT. AND EVERY
BIT COUNTS.In order to launch the book in an
appropriate way with the desired editions of 100 copies to begin with, we will need
funds. This is where we need your support. 
By making a contribution, large or small, you will not only help to
bring the book out, but in a way will be involved in spreading awareness on the subject. Your contributions will also be used for various other important jobs like editing, proofreading, designing, website hosting, launch and marketing of the book. This is not just a photo book but a thoroughly researched book on the widows and shelter homes in Vrindavan and Varanasi.

In return for your support, we would like to give back Prints from the series and hard copies of the book as tokens of our appreciation. There are e-books available too, for the overseas donors. Everything depends on what you opt for. (Please check the right hand side for details on the perks available.)
THIS IS HOW WE SHOW OUR LOVE.






With every 100 USD, a portion of the money gets donated in your name to the widows in Vrindavan. Indian donors get a copy of the Durga Photo Book, plus a set of 2 prints of 21cm X 30cm on fine art paper. Your name gets featured on our website. Donors outside India get an e-book and a set of 5 images of their choice. 
With every pledge of 70 USD you can get a Copy of the Durga Photo Book, plus a set of 2 prints of 21cm X 30cm on fine art paper. Your your name gets featured on our website. Donors outside India get an e-book and a set of 5 images.

With every pledge of 35 USD, you can get 2 prints of 21cm X 30cm on fine art paper. Plus your name gets featured on our website. Donors outside India stand to get 3 digital images of their choice.

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>I’m starting this campaign to gain more experience photographing, raise some money in order to learn more about photography and to provide interesting stock photos with backer input.

<div>
<h3>What I will do for you</h3>
<p>I plan on shooting a minimum of 150 photos (named “base” from this point onwards) in the town that I live in (Etten-Leur, Holland, Europe).<br/>These photos will include a varied amount of subjects including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Architecture (buildings, windmills)</li>
<li>Roads &amp; Paths</li>
<li>Nature (Fields, trees)</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides this base set I will take extra photos of specific subjects for anyone according to the perks.</p>
<p>For the $75 perk: The amount of photos received in the end increases each time someone adds another subject while selecting the $30 perk.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What your contributions will be used for</h3>
</div>
<p>The money raised by this project will be used for various materials that I need to get the photos to you in a good state.</p>
<div>Around €50,- ($66) will be used to purchase a better tripod than the one I have right now.<br/>The remaining amount will be used to cover other costs such as research, transportation, study materials and editing software.<br/>Anything that is left afterwards is kept in a jar to be saved up for a more professional camera.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Of course, a percentage also goes to indiegogo and other partners.

The Talons are a microfiber cloth with 2 sheaths that fit over the user's fingers.  Our design dramatically improves control of the cloth, allowing the user to remove dirt and debris from a lens or filter effectively but gently (which is critical when cleaning delicate, expensive lenses). Finally, the Talons Kit also includes an ultra-portable, organic, anti-static, non-toxic cleaning spray, in a spray bottle that is only as wide and tall a credit card and a half-inch thick!  That way, you can take them everywhere you go and have crystal clear vision no matter where you are.  

What else are Talons good for?  
Our testers overwhelmingly agreed that Talons are great for camera lenses, but also for glasses, sunglasses, smartphones, and tablets, and any other personal gadget that gets grimy throughout the course of the day.  Gone are the days of balancing a square cloth between your fingers while removing grime from these items, or smudging them even more when the edge of your finger goes over the edge of the cloth!

What are people saying about Peregrine Optics Talons?  

Professional photographers who tested or purchased the Talons kit have loved it without exception.  For example:

British documentary journalist Giovanni Tait actually purchased one of our test kits, took it during a shoot out in the rain, and wrote on his blog that the rain is ""never the easiest environment to clean a lens filter, but the talons managed to remove all residue, without leaving any of the usual lint traces or smears.""

Baltimore Photographer John Kardys remarked on his Facebook page that the Talons Kit ""is a terrific product for cleaning your lenses and filters.  It works great on glasses too.""

Many of the people who purchased our test units have come back to our website to leave great feedback!



Talons will help change the world through photography, and here's how:
This is the story of the quest of Jon and Rob (that's us, two guys from Baltimore) who, in late 2011, decided it was time to pursue something we've always been passionate about: using photography to inspire positive change in the world.  Motivated in part by a belief in human creativity, faith in the power of a moment in time captured in a still image, and a generous touch of total insanity, we created the platform to inspire change through photography (a blog called The Focused Perspective) and an entrepreneurial mechanism to support the blog's initiatives (the photography equipment company Peregrine Optics).

Ki volt az a magyar fotográfus, aki Edith Piaffal hamis igazolványokat csempészett be a német táborokban fogvatartott francia hadifoglyoknak a II. világháború alatt?
 
Melyik két magyar fotográfus volt évtizedeken át az előkelő nizzai Negresco szálloda fényképésze?
 
Ki volt az a magyar fotográfus, aki barátja, Robert Capa fotóit laborálta Párizsban, és Mexikóban egy híres szürrealista festőművészt vett feleségül?
 
Egyebek mellett mindezekre kérdésekre is választ ad kiadásra váró könyvünk, a Magyar származású fotográfusok Franciaországban az 1920-as évektől napjainkig. A kötetben több mint nyolcvan fotográfus szerepel, és közülük ötvenötnek külön fejezetet szentel. Ezek a leírások, a felkutatott személyes dokumentumoknak, visszaemlékezéseknek és korabeli újságcikkeknek köszönhetően, a lexikonszerű bemutatásnál bővebben tárgyalják az egyes alkotók életútját és szakmai karrierjét.
A közel 300 oldalas kiadvàny ùj felfedezéseket, ismereteket, több, mint 250 reprodukciót, alkotói publikàciós listàt, bibliogràfiai forràsokat tartalmaz, mely egyarànt izgalmas kalauz az érdeklődő olvasó és kutatók szàmàra.
A könyv teljes költsége messze meghaladja mind a kiadói, mind a szerzői anyagi keretet:

Szerzők honoráriuma: 0 euro
Nyomdaköltség: 10 000 euro
Megjelentetett képek jogdíjai: 2 000 euro

Ebből szeretnénk összegyűjteni legalább a jodíjakra elegendő összeget és a nyomdai költség valamennyi részét a téma iránt érdeklődők segítségével, így biztosítva a megfelelő szívonalú kiadvány 2018 második felében való megjelenését.

This was in style of a pin-up calendar, where we took women of all shapes and sizes and let them define what sexy meant to them. They ranged from overt to classy. Within one day, we reached our goal, and by the end of the campaign, we reached over $2000. Months following, we gained over $3000.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1558912055/nlwqg65mtlvjwghene0c.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>The 2018 calendar was released and it had made an impact. We got lot of attention, including the press covering it's release, and many people who really loved what we had done and a few people angry at us. All in all, we consider the calendar a success, and we are doing the same for 2020.</p><p>It's important we do this, as we see every day how much the world cares more about women and their issues, claiming they have nothing and men have everything. When men try to bring up anything in conversation of what is obviously overlooked by Feminists and SJW's, they are silence by being called a bigot or a woman-hater. We're not here to debate what women do or do not have. We are here to address how the world is leaving men and boys behind. Unfortunately, most don't hear about this, and are shocked with the information we have. They're even more shocked to learn that we are not misogynists and that there are women who are part of this movement.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1558915925/xeytmiue4cybp0asbs3z.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>What it comes down to is that we believe in equality for everyone. Many attack us saying, that in fighting for men means we want to turn back the hands of time to a point in history where women were chattel to men. This is not what we want. Helping men doesn't mean we must take away from women, and helping both can be achieved where both are treated fairly, both socially and legally.</p><p>Our message is that men are the greatest victims today, as they are forced not to speak up about their issues, and when they try, they're attacked. Men are required to keep quiet, deny their masculinity, and do as they're told. Males are told quite often, especially as young boys, that they are the gatekeepers for all things evil in the world and they must feel shame for how they were born.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559704530/sorx21ct0jusdh2qlzop.png"" src=""""/></p><p>Just like 2018, this calendar will bring to light many of the issues men face. mad_cat and Modern Medusa continue to work to bring awareness to men and give a voice to their problems. We see every day the challenges they face. While many have done great things in the name of giving men a voice, we are making a calendar full of women who want to express their passion in helping men.</p><p>We are asking for $1000 to get this project off the ground. If you're curious why we have raised the amount, please look in our FAQ further down.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1558922662/gs1khefgpq4chva8tvph.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>This year a portion of proceeds from the sale of our merchandise will go to Movember Foundation.

This will be done on the weekend of November 2nd, to raise awareness of men's issues and to invite people to sport a mustache (possible mustache stickers of our own design). This will be held in North Carolina. Details to follow.</p><p> </p><p><strong>$2500</strong> - Making the Lovely Ladies Calendar Documentary.<br/>Planned release in November 2020, we want to do a documentary that covers us making the calendar and all the challenges we face in doing so. Additionally, we want include the Release Party to be part of our documentary. This will be released on YouTube</p><p> </p><p><strong>$3000</strong> - Documentary Release and Screening.<br/>While we will be releasing the Documentary on YouTube, we want to hold a special event for the release of our Documentary, potentially in a theatre or other private screening, and making a Movember Foundation event. Details to follow.</p><p> </p><p><b>$4000</b> - 2020 Conference Meetup<br/>Undecided which Conference we will go to, we want to go to a conference as the Lovely Ladies. This will include setting up a booth at the conference and selling merchandise. We have our eyes set on ICMI or Vidcon, but open to other conferences as well. This will be included in our Documentary.</p><p> </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>FAQ</strong></u></h3><p><strong>How big will the calendar be?</strong></p><p>The calendar, when open, will be 8.5 x 11.</p><p> </p><p><strong>I'm outside the US, why am I being charged more?</strong></p><p>This is an extra charge for shipping. Since we are based in the United States, shipping overseas requires additional fees. This is only for the tiers that have physical items.</p><p> </p><p><strong>How are you supporting Men's Issues with pictures of women?</strong></p><p>First off, there are many women within the Men's Movement that want to see men given a voice. They have fathers, brothers, sons, lovers, and friends who are men, and are tired of them getting a raw deal in society and being punished simply for being born male.</p><p>Secondly, whether it's men or women, straight or gay, we know people love the look of a beautiful woman. We know that this will be one of the main reasons someone buys our calendar, which is why we want to include facts about men's issues with each picture. Thus, when someone hangs this calendar up; others will see it, and be exposed to facts that are otherwise silenced in our society today.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Do these women know you're using their images?</strong></p><p>Yes, they know. We asked each one personally if they want to appear in this calendar. They are also aware that this is for Men's Issues, and all of them wanted to be part of this for that reason.</p><p> </p><p><strong>You are for Men's Rights and have a calendar full of women wearing almost nothing, do you hate women?</strong></p><p>No, we don't hate women. We in fact love women... that's why we are doing this. Being for Men's Rights doesn't mean we are against women having rights. This isn't a zero-sum game for us, and we believe both can be treated equally under the law and within society itself. That is our ultimate goal.</p><p>Furthermore, sexuality is very beautiful and what makes us human. Many of us are quite sexual, and enjoy the display of beautiful women in sexy poses. Whether one's sexuality is masculine or feminine, no one should feel ashamed for what they desire.</p><p>Additionally, a few women in the 2018 calendar chose to go for classy rather than overt. We support both and were happy that all the women went with their own interpretation, that allow people to have a little of everything.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Why are you asking for more money this year?</strong></p><p>It's fair to say that in 2017, there was a lot we didn't know going into this; we simply asked for enough money to do a very small run for the calendar with the ability to ship the product. Additional products came as we reached received more money, such as a wall calendar and photobook. We didn't quite expect the turnout we had received.</p><p>This year, having done this once before, we have a clearer idea of how to go about this. We are reducing the number of products we'll have, but also have the Calendar and Quick Reference Guide right from the start. Starting with a bigger pool will allow us to get both products and have the overhead to ensure it gets shipped out.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""> </p><p><strong>Why can't I just give my money to a Men's charity?</strong></p><p>You are welcome and encouraged to do so. There are many charities out there that does great things for men who need help. One such charity that we will give a portion of sales to is the Movember Foundation. Movember raises vital funds and awareness for men’s health and funds projects in prostate cancer, testicular cancer, and mental health and suicide prevention.</p><p>One advantage to helping us, is our products are aimed at educating the world about Men's Issues and the more we can get this out there, the more awareness we can raise, and potentially more people will want to help support men. Our calendars not only have the Lovely Ladies, but key facts that many are unaware of and are surprised to learn is an actual issue.</p><p>So in supporting this campaign, we can raise awareness of Men's Issues and help out a great cause... all at the same time!</p><p> </p><p><strong>Why are you taking advantage of Men's Issues for profit?</strong></p><p>Doing a calendar takes quite a bit of resources. It's not as easy as it seems. Additionally, doing other products and a meetup also takes resources. The money earned in 2017 might seem like a lot, but in truth, the creators of the project earned no profit from it. All money from the campaign went into products, overhead, and the meetup. Sales from our products went to charity and the overhead.</p><p>Understand that our goal in doing this is not to make money. If that were the case, we'd be doing as little as we could to keep as much for ourselves as possible. The work that we do is it's own reward, because we get the message out there. And believe me when I say, there is a lot of work involved.</p><p> </p><p><strong>I saw in 2018 calendar that you featured that one person, who is now a controversial person...</strong></p><p>As diligent as we are in interviewing and researching our models for our calendar, there is no way we can know who will be a controversial figure after we produce our calendar. If we tried to anticipate who would be controversial in the future, we probably wouldn't make a calendar as it would be safer to assume everyone is bad than to focus on who people are right now.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Is the calendar going 12 months or 16 months? What if I get the 12 months now, will I have to spend more money to get the 16 months?</strong></p><p>We aim to make a 16 month calendar. This will depend entirely on how many models we can get. We want to get 16 models so we can have a bigger product with more facts concerning men, plus the calendar is useful during our development period.</p><p>Right now we are set on a 12 month calendar. When you get the $15 tier, you are getting the 12 month calendar. If we get the chance to do 16 months, you will automatically be upgraded to the 16 month calendar, as that will be the only product available, for not additional charge.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Is the digital calendar a Macho Men calendar or a Modern Medusa calendar? When will it be released?</strong></p><p>One of the biggest criticisms we received was that we didn't do a men's calendar for Men's Issues. Last year we tried to do a 2019 calendar featuring men. Unfortunately, we didn't find enough men. We are hoping this year to find enough men to do a 6 - 12 month calendar. If, however, we are unable to do so once again, we will instead do a Modern Medusa digital calendar.</p><p>Given the challenge we had in putting this together, we want to try to make this happen. Ideally we'd like to release the digital calendar at the same time as we release the physical calendar in November, but we may need to push it back to give us more time to find men to be in the calendar. Unless stated otherwise later, we'll push back to May 2020 for the digital calendar release.</p><p>If you are a man and want to be featured in the Macho Men calendar, please reach out to us.</p><p> </p><p><strong>I'm interested in appearing in the calendar, what do I need to do?</strong></p><p>If you would like to be in our 2020 calendar, we are accepting submissions from women (and men) willing to get involved. It is best to find us on social media and contact us from there. We will take a look at all the submissions given and pick from those to be featured in our 2020 calendar.

This was in style of a pin-up calendar, where we took women of all shapes and sizes and let them define what sexy meant to them. They ranged from overt to classy. Within one day, we reached our goal, and by the end of the campaign, we reached over $2000. Months following, we gained over $3000.The 2018 calendar was released and it had made an impact. We got lot of attention, including the press covering it's release, and many people who really loved what we had done and a few people angry at us. All in all, we consider the calendar a success, and we are doing the same for 2020.It's important we do this, as we see every day how much the world cares more about women and their issues, claiming they have nothing and men have everything. When men try to bring up anything in conversation of what is obviously overlooked by Feminists and SJW's, they are silence by being called a bigot or a woman-hater. We're not here to debate what women do or do not have. We are here to address how the world is leaving men and boys behind. Unfortunately, most don't hear about this, and are shocked with the information we have. They're even more shocked to learn that we are not misogynists and that there are women who are part of this movement.What it comes down to is that we believe in equality for everyone. Many attack us saying, that in fighting for men means we want to turn back the hands of time to a point in history where women were chattel to men. This is not what we want. Helping men doesn't mean we must take away from women, and helping both can be achieved where both are treated fairly, both socially and legally.Our message is that men are the greatest victims today, as they are forced not to speak up about their issues, and when they try, they're attacked. Men are required to keep quiet, deny their masculinity, and do as they're told. Males are told quite often, especially as young boys, that they are the gatekeepers for all things evil in the world and they must feel shame for how they were born.Just like 2018, this calendar will bring to light many of the issues men face. mad_cat and Modern Medusa continue to work to bring awareness to men and give a voice to their problems. We see every day the challenges they face. While many have done great things in the name of giving men a voice, we are making a calendar full of women who want to express their passion in helping men.We are asking for $1000 to get this project off the ground. If you're curious why we have raised the amount, please look in our FAQ further down.This year a portion of proceeds from the sale of our merchandise will go to Movember Foundation. The Movember Foundation is the leading global charity changing the face of men’s health. The Movember Foundation encourages men to raise vital funds and awareness for men’s health by growing a mustache during the month of November. Movember is addressing some of the biggest health issues faced by men: prostate cancer, testicular cancer, and mental health and suicide prevention.We are looking this year to do a 16 month calendar, so we can have more models and have more facts about men's issues. Additionally, we are looking to do a digital Men's Calendar.

This will be done on the weekend of November 2nd, to raise awareness of men's issues and to invite people to sport a mustache (possible mustache stickers of our own design). This will be held in North Carolina. Details to follow. $2500 - Making the Lovely Ladies Calendar Documentary.Planned release in November 2020, we want to do a documentary that covers us making the calendar and all the challenges we face in doing so. Additionally, we want include the Release Party to be part of our documentary. This will be released on YouTube $3000 - Documentary Release and Screening.While we will be releasing the Documentary on YouTube, we want to hold a special event for the release of our Documentary, potentially in a theatre or other private screening, and making a Movember Foundation event. Details to follow. $4000 - 2020 Conference MeetupUndecided which Conference we will go to, we want to go to a conference as the Lovely Ladies. This will include setting up a booth at the conference and selling merchandise. We have our eyes set on ICMI or Vidcon, but open to other conferences as well. This will be included in our Documentary. FAQHow big will the calendar be?The calendar, when open, will be 8.5 x 11. I'm outside the US, why am I being charged more?This is an extra charge for shipping. Since we are based in the United States, shipping overseas requires additional fees. This is only for the tiers that have physical items. How are you supporting Men's Issues with pictures of women?First off, there are many women within the Men's Movement that want to see men given a voice. They have fathers, brothers, sons, lovers, and friends who are men, and are tired of them getting a raw deal in society and being punished simply for being born male.Secondly, whether it's men or women, straight or gay, we know people love the look of a beautiful woman. We know that this will be one of the main reasons someone buys our calendar, which is why we want to include facts about men's issues with each picture. Thus, when someone hangs this calendar up; others will see it, and be exposed to facts that are otherwise silenced in our society today. Do these women know you're using their images?Yes, they know. We asked each one personally if they want to appear in this calendar. They are also aware that this is for Men's Issues, and all of them wanted to be part of this for that reason. You are for Men's Rights and have a calendar full of women wearing almost nothing, do you hate women?No, we don't hate women. We in fact love women... that's why we are doing this. Being for Men's Rights doesn't mean we are against women having rights. This isn't a zero-sum game for us, and we believe both can be treated equally under the law and within society itself. That is our ultimate goal.Furthermore, sexuality is very beautiful and what makes us human. Many of us are quite sexual, and enjoy the display of beautiful women in sexy poses. Whether one's sexuality is masculine or feminine, no one should feel ashamed for what they desire.Additionally, a few women in the 2018 calendar chose to go for classy rather than overt. We support both and were happy that all the women went with their own interpretation, that allow people to have a little of everything. Why are you asking for more money this year?It's fair to say that in 2017, there was a lot we didn't know going into this; we simply asked for enough money to do a very small run for the calendar with the ability to ship the product. Additional products came as we reached received more money, such as a wall calendar and photobook. We didn't quite expect the turnout we had received.This year, having done this once before, we have a clearer idea of how to go about this. We are reducing the number of products we'll have, but also have the Calendar and Quick Reference Guide right from the start. Starting with a bigger pool will allow us to get both products and have the overhead to ensure it gets shipped out. Why can't I just give my money to a Men's charity?You are welcome and encouraged to do so. There are many charities out there that does great things for men who need help. One such charity that we will give a portion of sales to is the Movember Foundation. Movember raises vital funds and awareness for men’s health and funds projects in prostate cancer, testicular cancer, and mental health and suicide prevention.One advantage to helping us, is our products are aimed at educating the world about Men's Issues and the more we can get this out there, the more awareness we can raise, and potentially more people will want to help support men. Our calendars not only have the Lovely Ladies, but key facts that many are unaware of and are surprised to learn is an actual issue.So in supporting this campaign, we can raise awareness of Men's Issues and help out a great cause... all at the same time! Why are you taking advantage of Men's Issues for profit?Doing a calendar takes quite a bit of resources. It's not as easy as it seems. Additionally, doing other products and a meetup also takes resources. The money earned in 2017 might seem like a lot, but in truth, the creators of the project earned no profit from it. All money from the campaign went into products, overhead, and the meetup. Sales from our products went to charity and the overhead.Understand that our goal in doing this is not to make money. If that were the case, we'd be doing as little as we could to keep as much for ourselves as possible. The work that we do is it's own reward, because we get the message out there. And believe me when I say, there is a lot of work involved. I saw in 2018 calendar that you featured that one person, who is now a controversial person...As diligent as we are in interviewing and researching our models for our calendar, there is no way we can know who will be a controversial figure after we produce our calendar. If we tried to anticipate who would be controversial in the future, we probably wouldn't make a calendar as it would be safer to assume everyone is bad than to focus on who people are right now. Is the calendar going 12 months or 16 months? What if I get the 12 months now, will I have to spend more money to get the 16 months?We aim to make a 16 month calendar. This will depend entirely on how many models we can get. We want to get 16 models so we can have a bigger product with more facts concerning men, plus the calendar is useful during our development period.Right now we are set on a 12 month calendar.

If we get the chance to do 16 months, you will automatically be upgraded to the 16 month calendar, as that will be the only product available, for not additional charge. Is the digital calendar a Macho Men calendar or a Modern Medusa calendar?

<h2>About the Project:</h2>
<p>In our travels we often come across places that mean more to us than others. Places we find our selves drawn to. I fell in love with my Elizabeth street apartment immediately. To me there is nothing like natural light and usually that means I shoot in nature. But when I moved in to my apartment just outside downtown Denver in 2016 I was blessed with a beautiful old building built in the 1890s, with old radiators and big windows. And great neighbors. In this book there are over 10 sets, over 50 images, all taken in this apartment building. All with vintage radiators, including the upstairs and downstairs neighbors'. </p>
<p>Despite the repetition of theme, by capturing different moods and different people in these same locations, I was able to put together a raw display of the human form and its beautiful relationship with light. I'm leaving Denver now. And in celebration of the 4 years spent in these walls I'm making this book and sharing it with you. It's more than just pictures. It's a memoir and a journal of the people that have come in to my life for moments or years and trusted me with their most vulnerable selves. I need your help to make this a reality. I know art books aren't a life necessity and times are hard right now for a lot of people, but a little art can make our lives warmer and brighter. Especially when you have big windows and the warmth of a vintage radiator.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To make this quality hard cover book more affordable to my friends, family, and art lovers I need to buy in bulk and have enough interest to make it worth it.  A lot of these images have never been posted anywhere due to censorship so this is your chance to own and see my art like never before.</p>
<ul>
<li>$600 is not the goal but the lowest initial amount I need to fund buying in bulk.</li>
<li>I'll be offering smaller items to those who want to contribute but can't afford a book</li>
<li>Funds will be used for printing and shipping of post cards, small prints and fine art books</li>
<li>I am also in the process of moving so your contribution will help me get myself back to New England and creating again.</li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><i>Forbidden Memory</i> brings a group of rare, historically important photographs of the Cultural Revolution in Tibet to an American audience.  The photographer, Tsering Dorje, was a native Tibetan and an officer in the Peoples’ Liberation Army stationed in Lhasa.  As a PLA official photographer, he was permitted to photograph many key events:  marches and parades, “struggle sessions,” the destruction of the Jokhang Temple, and much else. He died in 1991.  His daughter, the writer and poet Tsering Woeser, assembled over 300 of his photographs into a book, first published in Taiwan in 2006 and scheduled to appear in the U.S. in 2020 in a translation by Susan Chen.   This is the only known body of photographs of Tibet during the Cultural Revolution. </p>
<p>The exhibit is scheduled for October 2019 at City Gallery in New Haven.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>My budget for the project is this:</p>
<p>$3,000 for materials, framing, preparation of captions and hanging the show.</p>
<p>$1,500 for publicity (I want people to know about it!)</p>
<p>$500 for a public reception and to defray travel expenses for guest speakers.</p>
<p>Each donor will be thanked by name in the exhibit program.  In addition:</p>
<p>$75 gets you an 11"" x 17"" archival inkjet print on the same paper used in the exhibit.</p>
<p>$150 gets you a 17"" x 22"" archival inkjet print on the same paper used in the exhibit.</p>
<p>$500 gets you three 17"" x 22"" archival inkjet prints on the same paper used in the exhibit.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>These are extraordinary, compelling images of a time and place the Chinese government has tried very hard to erase from history.  They might not have survived at all if not for a long chain of improbable events.  But however unlikely, they're here, and I want people to know about them and see them.</p>

Unterstützer,</p>
<p>
</p><p>unsere ""A World in Distress“ Crowdfunding Kampagne auf Indiegogo ist nun vorüber.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alle
Unterstützer sollten zu diesem Zeitpunkt bereits eine
Dankeschön-Postkarte erhalten haben und auch unser Fotokalender
wurde bereits ausgeliefert.* Der Bildband wird weiterhin, wie
versprochen, pünktlich zum Mai 2015 verschickt, obwohl wir unser
Wunsch-Ziel von 25.000€ nicht erreicht haben. Um dies zu
ermöglichen, werden wir weitere eigene finanzielle Mittel einbringen
und unsere Kampagne ab dem 25. Dezember auf
<u><a href=""http://worldindistress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://worldindistress.com</a></u>
fortführen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Die letzten
zwei Monate des Fundraisings haben uns gezeigt, dass durchaus reges
Interesse an unserem Projekt besteht, wir aber mehr Zeit benötigen,
um eine größere Zahl an Unterstützern zu finden und mehr
Medienpräsenz zu akquirieren. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dank
eurer Hilfe haben wir es bisher geschafft, mehr als 8.000€ zu
sammeln und somit einen guten Anfang zu machen, um den Druck und
Vertrieb unseres Buches zu finanzieren und drei ausgewählte
Hilfsorganisationen zu unterstützen. Wir wollen euch für euer
Vertrauen danken und uns erkenntlich zeigen, indem wir euch
Unterstützer der ersten Stunde namentlich in unserem Buch und auf
unserer Website aufführen wollen.** Zusätzlich werden alle
<i>„Unterstützer+“</i>
natürlich ein signiertes Exemplar unseres Bildbandes erhalten.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Damit
wir möglichst viele Menschen mit unserer Arbeit erreichen können,
führen wir unsere Kampagne ab dem 25. Dezember auf
<u><a href=""http://worldindistress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://worldindistress.com</a></u>
fort. Dort wird es möglich sein, unser Projekt weiterhin zu
unterstützen und unseren Bildband als Print- oder als
Digital-PDF-Version bis zum Erscheinen im Mai 2015 vorzubestellen.
Dabei wollen wir ein neues Gesamt-Fundingziel von 15.000€ anpeilen,
um somit auf eine Auflage von mindestens 300 gedruckten Exemplaren zu
kommen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wie
versprochen werden wir alle Bestellungen ausliefern und auch den
Hilfsorganisationen ihren  Anteil von 20% der Erlöse zukommen
lassen. Die Auszahlungen werden wir so transparent wie möglich
gestalten und in unserem Netzwerk, beispielsweise auch auf Facebook,
entsprechende Beweise liefern, dass die Gelder auch tatsächlich bei
den Organisationen angekommen sind. Zusätzlich wird sich in den
nächsten Wochen auch entscheiden, ob wir die Spenden sogar
persönlich bei den Hilfsprojekten abliefern können.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wir danken
euch herzlichst für eure Unterstützung und wünschen euch ein
frohes Fest und einen guten Rutsch ins neue Jahr.</p>

Wir wollen Menschen, mittels Fotografie, für die Umstände sensibilisieren, die Fortschritt und Entwicklung in den ärmsten Ländern der Welt hemmen oder gar verhindern.</p><p>Neben dem Fotobuch im Vorverkauf sind ab dem 25.

Oft werden sie unter falschen Versprechungen in die Städte gelockt und von dort in die Untergrundbordelle Kathmandus und Indiens geschleust. Maiti Nepal hilft diesen Menschen, aus ihrer Lage zu entfliehen und einen Neuanfang zu starten. </p><p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/938250/files/20141017095552-Young_boy_in_Cit__Soleil__Haiti_-_Weinert_Brothers.jpg?1413564952"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h4>

</h4><p>Die Organisation Restavek Freedom hat sich die Abschaffung der in Haiti weitverbreiteten Kindersklaverei zur Aufgabe gemacht. Tausende Kinder werden jährlich von ihren Eltern an wohlhabendere Haitianer abgegeben, um dort im Gegenzug für häusliche Arbeiten eine ausreichende Ernährung und Schulbildung zu bekommen.

<p>We are Dennis and Patrick Weinert, freelance filmmakers and photographers and since January 2014 we are working on our first documentary photography and charity project, which deals with the issue of poverty in a global context.</p>
<p>Our previous work in the slums of Manila has motivated the creation of the “A World in Distress” campaign.</p>
<p>With exemplary anecdotes and photo essays from Burkina Faso, Nepal and Haiti, we want to show the various facets of extreme poverty and shed light on the practical implications of the development aid system and advancing globalization.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/950369/files/20141022023751-A_Haitian_refugee_receives_his_daily_ration.jpg?1413970671"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The goal of our project is to raise awareness of the circumstances that inhibit progress and development in the poorest countries in the world, by using a crowdfunding campaign to finance the distribution of our photo book and to collect donations for local and sustainable aid organizations.</p>
<p>In addition to the pre-sale launch of our photo book, the German startup company <a href=""http://goo.gl/ah20rO"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">arrangio.de</a> will commence distributing our fine art print portfolio „Marginal Notes“ on 25th October 2014.</p>
<p>All profits generated by book and art print sales will be donated to the aid organizations <b>Maiti Nepal</b>, <b>Restavek Freedom</b> and the <b>Katrin Rohde Foundation.</b></p>
<h3><b><br/></b></h3>
<h3><b>What we need &amp; what you get</b></h3>
<p>We want to collect 25,000€ in order to be able to fund the print and distribution of the photo book, to cover a fraction of our production costs and to simultaneously support three sustainable aid projects.</p>
<p>All profits that will be earned with our photo book, now or after the campaign, will be donated. Our private expenses of 20,000€, which we have previously invested in the production of the content of this book, will not be recovered by this campaign. Our financial plan dictates that we can only regain a maximum of 50% of our expenses with this project.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we want to support our selected organizations, even though we will lose a big portion of our investment. Therefore, we have decided to donate a share of 20% of the sales price of <b>every book or perk</b> sold, which  represents our profit margin.</p>
<p>In case our campaign is successful, we would not only get the chance to publish our first book, but could also send 5,000€ to our supported charitable organizations.</p>
<p>Should our campaign exceed its funding goal, the donated amount would of course increase.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/950389/files/20141022025317-Aufsteller_Drucke.jpg?1413971597"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> In addition to our bilingual photo book with more than 160 pages and 80 photographs, we want to offer you a range of other perks that will give you the chance to support our campaign in a way that suits your wallet.</p>
<p>In addition to 5€ and 10€ perks and a calendar including a PDF-version of the photo book, we also offer higher-priced perks that will allow you (or your company) to become a partner of our project.</p>
<p>As Supporter+ or Partner we will feature you or your company in our book and on all of our channels and websites, thereby connecting your brand with our artistic &amp; charitable project.</p>
<p>If our campaign does not reach its funding goal, we will bear all additional costs incurred by the smaller print runs, so that all supporters can obtain their ordered perk and the aid organizations receive their promised share.</p>
<p>We think this is fair, since we are not looking to make a financial gain with “A World in Distress”. Getting the chance to do good with our work is a reward in itself - and at the same time we will certainly benefit professionally from this project in the future. In combination with the experiences we made during the production process, this is already more than we could ever ask for.</p>

<p>In case of a wire transfer payment, we will transfer the money from our bank account to the Indiegogo campaign in your name, so that your support will contribute to the campaign counter.</p>
<p>Once your payment has arrived, we will send you an ""A World in Distress"" postcard to your physical address. A detailed receipt will be shipped to you together with your perk.

Human trafficking is a massive problem in Nepal, affecting tens of thousands of young girls, especially from the poorest rural regions of the country.

<h4><b>Restavek Freedom - Haiti | <a href=""http://restavekfreedom.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.restavekfreedom.org</a></b></h4>
<p>The Restavek Freedom Foundation works to abolish child slavery in Haiti. Every year, thousands of children are sent to wealthier Haitians by their impoverished parents, where they are supposed to receive adequate nutrition and education in return for domestic work. Many of these so-called ""Restaveks"" are not only exposed to long hours of physical labor, but have to endure violence and sexual assaults. Frequently, the promised education and nutrition are withheld from these domestic servants. Restavek Freedom works to prevent these abuses by providing transition homes for the children and raising awareness about this issue in Haiti's rural areas.</p>

<h4><b>Katrin Rohde-Stiftung - Burkina Faso | <a href=""http://www.katrin-rohde-stiftung.de/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.katrin-rohde-stiftung.de</a></b></h4>
<p>The Katrin Rohde Foundation maintains a variety of facilities for the accommodation of vulnerable children and teenagers and provides them with social and medical assistance. Burkina Faso's population not only has to suffer from extreme economic and climatic conditions, but is also affected by the conflict in the neighboring country of Mali. The increasing threat of terrorism and the rampant Ebola epidemic in West Africa further deepen the economic crisis. The Katrin Rohde Foundation is fighting on many fronts to alleviate the plight of the people of Burkina Faso and to offer them a perspective. Disability projects, the operation of an agriculture school and a multi-generational farm are also part of the foundation's activities.</p>

<p>In cooperation with the German online-startup arrangio GmbH we are also offering fine art prints of our portfolio <a href=""http://goo.gl/ah20rO"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">“Marginal Notes”</a>. “Marginal Notes” deals with the ambivalence in our creative process. Where normally poverty and misery, illness and death, violence and crime are the main focus of our work, in this series we want to honor the beauty we encounter on our travels. The works in this portfolio are visually appealing and at the same time socially relevant. We see “Marginal Notes” as an extension of ""A World in Distress"", which is why all profits from fine art print sales will also go to <b>Maiti Nepal</b>, <b>Restavek Freedom</b> and the <b>Katrin Rohde Foundation</b>.</p>
<p>Please note that the sale of the <b>""Marginal Notes"" fine art prints</b> is handled by <b><a href=""http://goo.gl/ah20rO"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">arrangio.de</a></b> and the revenues generated are not displayed as part of the crowdfunding campaign. However, a share of 20% of the sales price is also donated to our selected charitable projects.</p>

</div><h3><br/></h3></div>","Unsere Indiegogo-Kampagne ist vorüber - jetzt geht es auf http://worldindistress.com weiter!Liebe
Unterstützer,

unsere ""A World in Distress“ Crowdfunding Kampagne auf Indiegogo ist nun vorüber.

Alle
Unterstützer sollten zu diesem Zeitpunkt bereits eine
Dankeschön-Postkarte erhalten haben und auch unser Fotokalender
wurde bereits ausgeliefert.* Der Bildband wird weiterhin, wie
versprochen, pünktlich zum Mai 2015 verschickt, obwohl wir unser
Wunsch-Ziel von 25.000€ nicht erreicht haben. Um dies zu
ermöglichen, werden wir weitere eigene finanzielle Mittel einbringen
und unsere Kampagne ab dem 25. Dezember auf
http://worldindistress.com
fortführen.

Die letzten
zwei Monate des Fundraisings haben uns gezeigt, dass durchaus reges
Interesse an unserem Projekt besteht, wir aber mehr Zeit benötigen,
um eine größere Zahl an Unterstützern zu finden und mehr
Medienpräsenz zu akquirieren. 


Dank
eurer Hilfe haben wir es bisher geschafft, mehr als 8.000€ zu
sammeln und somit einen guten Anfang zu machen, um den Druck und
Vertrieb unseres Buches zu finanzieren und drei ausgewählte
Hilfsorganisationen zu unterstützen. Wir wollen euch für euer
Vertrauen danken und uns erkenntlich zeigen, indem wir euch
Unterstützer der ersten Stunde namentlich in unserem Buch und auf
unserer Website aufführen wollen.** Zusätzlich werden alle
„Unterstützer+“
natürlich ein signiertes Exemplar unseres Bildbandes erhalten.

Damit
wir möglichst viele Menschen mit unserer Arbeit erreichen können,
führen wir unsere Kampagne ab dem 25. Dezember auf
http://worldindistress.com
fort. Dort wird es möglich sein, unser Projekt weiterhin zu
unterstützen und unseren Bildband als Print- oder als
Digital-PDF-Version bis zum Erscheinen im Mai 2015 vorzubestellen.
Dabei wollen wir ein neues Gesamt-Fundingziel von 15.000€ anpeilen,
um somit auf eine Auflage von mindestens 300 gedruckten Exemplaren zu
kommen.

Wie
versprochen werden wir alle Bestellungen ausliefern und auch den
Hilfsorganisationen ihren  Anteil von 20% der Erlöse zukommen
lassen. Die Auszahlungen werden wir so transparent wie möglich
gestalten und in unserem Netzwerk, beispielsweise auch auf Facebook,
entsprechende Beweise liefern, dass die Gelder auch tatsächlich bei
den Organisationen angekommen sind. Zusätzlich wird sich in den
nächsten Wochen auch entscheiden, ob wir die Spenden sogar
persönlich bei den Hilfsprojekten abliefern können.

Wir danken
euch herzlichst für eure Unterstützung und wünschen euch ein
frohes Fest und einen guten Rutsch ins neue Jahr.

Beste Grüße

Dennis und
Patrick Weinert

Scroll down to see the English version of this campaign!Das ""A World in Distress"" ProjektWir sind Dennis und Patrick Weinert, selbständige Filmschaffende und Fotografen, und seit Januar 2014 arbeiten wir an unserem ersten sozialdokumentarischen Foto- und Spendenprojekt, das sich mit dem Thema Armut im globalen Kontext beschäftigt. Den entscheidenden Impuls für die Entstehung von „A World in Distress“ gab uns unsere Arbeit in den Slums von Manila im Jahr zuvor.Anhand exemplarischer Anekdoten und Bilderserien aus Burkina Faso, Nepal und Haiti, wollen wir die verschiedenen Facetten extremer Armut beleuchten und über die praktischen Auswirkungen von Entwicklungshilfe und fortschreitender Globalisierung berichten.Ziel unseres Vorhabens ist es, mithilfe einer Crowdfunding-Kampagne den Druck und Vertrieb unseres Bildbandes zu finanzieren und Spenden für lokale und nachhaltige Hilfsprojekte zu sammeln. Wir wollen Menschen, mittels Fotografie, für die Umstände sensibilisieren, die Fortschritt und Entwicklung in den ärmsten Ländern der Welt hemmen oder gar verhindern.Neben dem Fotobuch im Vorverkauf sind ab dem 25. Oktober zusätzlich auch hochwertige Kunstdrucke aus unserem ""Randnotizen""-Portfolio über das Online-Unternehmen arrangio.de verfügbar.Sämtliche Gewinne aus dem Buch- und Kunstdruckverkauf kommen zu gleichen Anteilen den Hilfsprojekten Maiti Nepal, Restavek Freedom und der Katrin Rohde-Stiftung zugute.Was du uns gibst & was du bekommstWir möchten 25.000€ sammeln, damit wir den Druck und Vertrieb des Bildbandes finanzieren, einen Teil unserer Produktionskosten decken, und gleichzeitig drei nachhaltige Hilfsprojekte unterstützen können.Alle Gewinne, die auf kurz oder lang mit diesem Projekt erwirtschaftet werden, wollen wir spenden. Unsere privaten Aufwendungen von 20.000€, die wir vorab in die Produktion der Inhalte dieses Buches investiert haben, werden wir dabei maximal zur Hälfte zurückgewinnen können.Nichtsdestotrotz, wollen wir auch bei Verlust unseres Einsatzes die von uns ausgewählten Projekte unterstützen. Deshalb haben wir uns dazu entschieden, schon ab dem ersten verkauften Buch einen Anteil von 20% des Verkaufspreises zu spenden.Im Falle eines Erfolges unserer Kampagne, würden wir nicht nur die Chance bekommen, unser erstes Buch zu veröffentlichen, sondern könnten auch 5.000€ an die von uns unterstützten gemeinnützigen Projekte senden.Falls unsere Kampagne über ihr Finanzierungsziel hinausschießt, steigt natürlich auch die Spendensumme.Neben unserem zweisprachigen Bildband mit mehr als 160 Seiten und 80 Fotografien, bieten wir dir auch eine Reihe von anderen Produkten an, sogenannte Perks, mit denen du uns und die gemeinnützigen Projekte unterstützen kannst.Angefangen bei einem Fotokalender und einer Ebook-Version des Bildbandes, bis hin zu höherpreisigeren Perks, bei denen du (oder dein Unternehmen) als Partner unseres Projekts fungieren kannst, gibt es zahlreiche Möglichkeiten, unser Vorhaben zu unterstützen.Als Unterstützer+ oder Partner nennen wir dich bzw. dein Unternehmen in unserem Buch und auf all unseren Kanälen und Websites, und bringen somit deine Marke mit unserem künstlerisch-gemeinnützigen Projekt in Verbindung.Sollte unsere Kampagne das Finanzierungsziel nicht erreichen, werden wir alle Mehrkosten, die durch die geringeren Druckauflagen entstehen, selbst übernehmen. Somit kann jeder sein bestelltes Produkt erhalten und auch die von uns unterstützten Projekte bekommen ihren versprochenen Anteil.Wir halten dies für fair, da es uns bei diesem Projekt nicht um einen finanziellen Gewinn geht, wir die Chance bekommen, mit unserer Arbeit Gutes zu bewirken und gleichzeitig auf lange Sicht sicher auch beruflich von diesem Projekt profitieren können. Die Erfahrungen, die wir im Rahmen von „A World in Distress“ machen durften, sind ohnehin schon unbezahlbar.Als Zahlungsmöglichkeit steht dir, neben der PayPal Funktion auf Indiegogo, auch Barzahlung (bspw. wenn du aus Rheda-Wiedenbrück kommst) und Banküberweisung zur Verfügung. Kommt PayPal für dich nicht in Frage, möchten wir dich bitten, uns per Email zu kontaktieren:sales@weinertbrothers.com Im Falle einer Barzahlung oder Banküberweisung, übernehmen wir in deinem Namen den Weitertransfer auf die Indiegogo-Kampagne, damit deine Unterstützung hier dokumentiert und sichtbar wird.Nachdem deine Zahlung bei uns eingegangen ist, erhältst du von uns innerhalb weniger Tage einen Beleg in Form einer „A World in Distress“ Postkarte. Eine detaillierte Quittung liegt dann später beim Versand deines Produktes bei. Leider können wir keine rechtsgültige Spendenbescheinigung ausstellen, da wir selbst nicht im Rahmen eines gemeinnützigen Vereins organisiert sind.Die Spendenprojekte
Maiti Nepal – Nepal | www.maitinepal.org
Die Organisation Maiti Nepal bietet den Opfern von Menschenhandel und Zwangsprostitution einen Ort der Zuflucht und ermöglicht ihnen durch schulische und berufliche Ausbildung eine Zukunft. Menschenhandel ist ein massives Problem in Nepal, das zehntausende junge Mädchen, vor allem aus den ärmsten, ländlichen Regionen des Landes, betrifft. Oft werden sie unter falschen Versprechungen in die Städte gelockt und von dort in die Untergrundbordelle Kathmandus und Indiens geschleust. Maiti Nepal hilft diesen Menschen, aus ihrer Lage zu entfliehen und einen Neuanfang zu starten. 
Restavek Freedom – Haiti | www.restavekfreedom.org
Die Organisation Restavek Freedom hat sich die Abschaffung der in Haiti weitverbreiteten Kindersklaverei zur Aufgabe gemacht. Tausende Kinder werden jährlich von ihren Eltern an wohlhabendere Haitianer abgegeben, um dort im Gegenzug für häusliche Arbeiten eine ausreichende Ernährung und Schulbildung zu bekommen. Viele dieser sogenannten „Restaveks“ sind nicht nur stundenlanger körperlicher Arbeit ausgesetzt, sondern müssen auch Gewalt und sexuelle Übergriffe erdulden. Die den leiblichen Eltern versprochene Schulbildung für ihre Kinder wird oft nicht gewährleistet. Restavek Freedom versucht diesen Zuständen durch die Bereitstellung von Auffangheimen und durch Aufklärungskampagnen entgegenzuwirken.

Many of these so-called ""Restaveks"" are not only exposed to long hours of physical labor, but have to endure violence and sexual assaults. Frequently, the promised education and nutrition are withheld from these domestic servants. Restavek Freedom works to prevent these abuses by providing transition homes for the children and raising awareness about this issue in Haiti's rural areas.


Katrin Rohde-Stiftung - Burkina Faso | www.katrin-rohde-stiftung.de
The Katrin Rohde Foundation maintains a variety of facilities for the accommodation of vulnerable children and teenagers and provides them with social and medical assistance. Burkina Faso's population not only has to suffer from extreme economic and climatic conditions, but is also affected by the conflict in the neighboring country of Mali. The increasing threat of terrorism and the rampant Ebola epidemic in West Africa further deepen the economic crisis. The Katrin Rohde Foundation is fighting on many fronts to alleviate the plight of the people of Burkina Faso and to offer them a perspective. Disability projects, the operation of an agriculture school and a multi-generational farm are also part of the foundation's activities.

The “Marginal Notes” Gallery Prints

In cooperation with the German online-startup arrangio GmbH we are also offering fine art prints of our portfolio “Marginal Notes”. “Marginal Notes” deals with the ambivalence in our creative process. Where normally poverty and misery, illness and death, violence and crime are the main focus of our work, in this series we want to honor the beauty we encounter on our travels. The works in this portfolio are visually appealing and at the same time socially relevant. We see “Marginal Notes” as an extension of ""A World in Distress"", which is why all profits from fine art print sales will also go to Maiti Nepal, Restavek Freedom and the Katrin Rohde Foundation.
Please note that the sale of the ""Marginal Notes"" fine art prints is handled by arrangio.de and the revenues generated are not displayed as part of the crowdfunding campaign. However, a share of 20% of the sales price is also donated to our selected charitable projects.

<p class=""MsoNormal"">A great photo can bring joy to the worst situations, a happy memory in a moment of sadness, hope when all someone sees is despair.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">My name is Beau and I love taking photos! I have been involved in photography for 10+ years. Having shot hundreds of portraits, weddings, and events, it has been my great pleasure to capture memories of so many. This past November, my home, New Jersey, was devastated by Hurricane Sandy. So many of my friends, myself, and family lost so much. To help contribute back, I started offering Free Portraits to those who lost their family portraits to the flooding, wind, rain, looting, and other storm damage. The response and outpour of joy it gave people was overwhelming. So much so, we were recognized by several media outlets, and had appointments into the following year. It really showed how a simple photo can bring joy and hope to the worst and most dire situations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">This got me thinking, how else can we bring joy with photography? Though we are still rebuilding, I have noticed that a number of weddings, schools, and families have cut photography from their budgets due to economic hardships caused both by the storm and general financial hardships.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">My goal is to give those people the photos they deserve!</p>
<p> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">We plan on using all funds received to offer FREE and discounted services to those who otherwise couldn't afford them. We will be working with students and like-minded photographers, in hopes of teaching both better technique and the sense of humanitarian duty to the world around them. We will be purchasing equipment, renting space, and offering free training to those who want to help bring smiles to those who don't have much to smile about, one photo at a time!</p>
<p> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Whether it be replacing a family portrait lost to a natural disaster, giving a less fortunate bride and groom a beautiful photo to put on their wall as they start a life together, or allowing a child who's family cannot afford school portraits the chance to have that photo to look back, years later, and smile, we believe that everyone deserves the chance to capture and relive the good times in life. With your help, we can bring this joy to others.</p>

<h2>My Goal:</h2>

</div></div>","Hi! Thanks for stopping by my fundraising page! Since I'm a photographer, and this is about a photo-jouney that we are going to take together, you're going to see lots of my pictures.


Call me DREAD. I'm the dude with the camera, fedora and gasmask on. I'm the dude who will be exploring the Odd, Quirky and Downright Bizarre Side of the Greater Cincinnati Area.



My Mission: 
Starting in October I will spend one year exploring the various dark and gritty cities and towns of the Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana Tristate Area. Also known as Greater Cincinnati. I will photograph and journal my findings for you to explore. Trust me, there are some real oddities!!

My Goal:
I will record my findings into an independant magazine (or ""zine"") called Agoraphobic Dream, which will be dropping this coming November, giving you a monthly update on my progress as I seek out and extract those things you didn't even know were all around you...

Who Am I?
I'm DREAD. I'm a photographer, writer and artist. But the real twist is that I'm agoraphobic, which means it is very difficult to leave my own house. It gives me panic attacks (get it? DREAD?). If it were up to my own brain, I'd never leave the house. But what a boring life that'd be! So I am heading out to explore!! And I'm taking you with me!

Struggles
So not only will you be getting my photography and travelogue in the zine, but you'll also get a look into the internal workings of someone rising above a disability. And once the year is up and we've taken it as far as it can go, I will reveal myself so that we may have that human connection we deserve.

Many Forms of Photography
I enjoy taking part in many popular forms of photography. The fun faces found in Street Photography, those captured moments that are so precious. The stories within the objects of Urban Decay photos. And don't forget the pulse-pounding excitement and voyeurism of Urban Exploration. These are some of the styles of images I plan to take for you, and many more!

So What Do You Get?
Is it just about me?
No!

It's filtered through me, but it's about everything else!
We're going to meet weird people. Explore odd regions. Dream about the far-off future. Interview those who know the street better than I do. Find those stories!

Now I work on the book. It will be published during summer 2017. All contributors will receive the book not later than the end of September. You can still pre-order the book HERE.I am a self-taught professional photographer, born on April 13 1984, based in Prague, Czech Republic. My distinctive vision of photography is etched as a unique space located in a balance and serenity, while my sophisticated and rewarding images exist in that narrow window of a few seconds between dreaming and awakening. I am grateful I have won over 50 major international photography awards from different competitions, including Professional Photographer of the Year, Nikon International Photo Contest, Prix de la Photographie Paris, Sony World Photography Awards and International Photography Awards eleven times in a row. My solo and group exhibitions have been seen from South and North America, through Europe, all the way to Asia. My photographs have been exhibited in places such as New York, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Tokyo, Milan, London, Miami, Paris, Prague, Hong Kong, Kiev and many more. I feel flattered my work stood proudly alongside the likes of Andy Warhol, Annie Leibovitz, Banksy, Damien Hirst or Helmut Newton. I love the smell of autumn and the sparkling grains of dust floating in the sunset.Here are some photographs from the book ""10 YEARS"":Until You Wake UpSomebody Told Me This Is RealIt Is YouEverytime You GoWe Missed YouI Wish I Was SpecialI Found The SilenceFar From The Rivers Ten years. Ten years since I first fell passionately in love with photography: a love affair that completely consumed and overwhelmed me. It’s impossible now to imagine my former life without it. Photography for me began as a kind of therapy, but ironically it became a powerful, addictive compulsion. This love affair, this deep love and passion, has brought me many worldwide exhibitions, and I have won a great number of international photography awards. Nothing in our lives compels us or shapes our life decisions more powerfully than passion does. Throughout that decade, I encountered characters who shaped the narrative of my life; now those people are powerful memories. There were moments and events too that changed my perspective on life and on my own self. I began recording these events in order to capture my own perception of reality in photographic form, only to realise that in doing so, I was creating episodes chronologically like entries in a journal. Even though these moments were personal and very intimate, I decided to gather them together and publish them in book form. I traveled a lot  and visited many unique places. I took there many photos I can put together in one Book ""10 YEARS"" now. My goal is to publish the 800 copy limited edition book ""10 YEARS"" through fundraising platform. It will be a high quality art photobook containing my photos from the years 2007-2017, a hardcover gem that will really hold its own on bookshelves and coffee tables. Many details during printing and binding separate a good book from a great book and I want this to be a great book. I need your help to reach a goal of 15,000 USD to publish the book and ship all books and prints to you.While the book itself will be the main goal I am also offering a Portfolio One (set of small signed prints) and beautiful museum archival prints up to 180x100cm (71x39in) of your own choice from my portfolio, personally signed and numbered (limited edition of 25). All prints will be immediately sent till the end of May. All books and Portfolio One sets will be sent immediately after publishing it during this September. Here are the perks you gain if you become a part of this journey: THE BOOK ""10 YEARS""After ten years of work as a photographer and a hundred of exhibitions around the world, I would like to celebrate it by creating high quality art photography book called ""10 YEARS"", 800 copy limited edition book, a hardcover gem that will really hold its own on bookshelves and coffee tables. It will be really big 28x28cm (11x11in) 100-page hardcover book, silk-finish 200g premium paper, personally signed, features all of my favorite photos 2007-2017. And because I appreciate your support each book will contain 3 extra signed prints (only for books purchased during the crowdfunding campaign). PRINTSEveryone who gets a perk with any kind of print will be personally contacted via email with all details.

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>I started at KU in the Art &amp; Design school from the beginning.  From my first day as a freshman 'til my last day as a senior, I'll be a part of KU's Design department.  I switched into the Photomedia major in the spring of my sophomore year after realizing how well a camera fit into my hands.  The major is practically still a newborn as it began in 2008.  There have been a lot of growing pains as a result of that, but I have learned so much from my teachers and fellow students.  Unfortunately, the major still does not offer a senior show, unlike the other majors in the Design department like Graphic Design and Illustration.  I have developed a really great body of work, however, as a result of the time and creativity that I have poured into school.  So I asked myself, ""Why can't I have a show too?""  The answer is that... I can!</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Art</h3>
<p>The work that will be shown is a series of photographs printed at 13x19"".  The photographs are a commentary on heroes in American culture, and they question how we view and value them.  The series was shot digitally with a macro lens.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The costs for this project are derived completely from printing and promotional costs.  A senior show is a great way to lure in potential employers, and therefore everything must be well publicized and well planned.  Prints are the most expensive part of this project because gallery level prints are archival, beautiful works of art.  They require the best paper and the best printers.  Luckily, my status as a student allows me access to professional printers on campus, but the ink and the paper add up quickly.  Promotional materials are also a smaller percentage of the costs simply because Facebook doesn't always cut it.  I respond best to a physical item in my hand or purse when it comes to any advertising.  I will be sending out event postcards to potential employers, as well as placing them strategically around Lawrence and campus.  </p>

<h3>Background:</h3>
<p>From a very young age I have had a deep love for all things wildlife, especially some of the stunning animals that call Africa home. That love and passion eventually turned into to a fairly successful hobby in nature and wildlife photography which has taken me to many beautiful places in the Western United States. Naturally, an African Photography Safari has long been at the top of my list for places to visit if I were ever able to travel outside of the country. I have recently been given an opportunity with the company that I work for to travel to our office in South Africa. So my dream of one day visiting Africa is going to come true! Safari's aren't cheap though, and not something I'd easily be able to get away with adding to my expense report to my employer ;) So I've creating this campaign in hopes that I can raise the funds necessary to make this happen.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Looking into the cost of Safari's, guides, local transfers and travel within South Africa I've come up with a goal of $2500 to make this happen. I leave for Cape Town on May 10th so I'll only be running this campaign for 2 weeks. Asking for money is not something I'm very comfortable with at all, especially when there are so many other campaigns and charities and causes that are far more worthy of people's resources than mine, which is why I've decided to set up some perks for donations made. </p>
<p>As mentioned above, I have been blessed with the opportunity to see and photograph some beautiful places and animals in the Western United States. So I will offer perks of signed prints in various sizes depending on how much you donate of any of my existing photographs from my online portfolio at <a href=""http://www.ericreeder.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.ericreeder.net</a>.

<h3>A collaborative writing and photography project by Nika Knight and Alex Nelson</h3>
<p>Places like Fort McMurray, Fort Chipewyan, or Fort McKay might not ring many bells. But whether you know it or not, you’re intimately connected to these Canadian communities: every time you turn on a light or press your foot to the gas pedal, there’s a good chance you’re using energy extracted from the soil of Northern Alberta.</p>
<p>There is a layer of black, sticky earth spread out in a deposit with a surface area greater than that of England, where a dense form of petroleum called “bitumen” is mixed in with sand and clay. Many people in the U.S. know these sands as “tar sands.” But most members of the communities at the heart of the industry in Alberta, whether they are for or against the mining operations, almost uniformly refer to them as “oil sands.” We’re going to refer to them here as “oil sands” because this is what the almost everyone in Northern Alberta -- whether they are for or against the industry -- call them.</p>
<p>The oil sands are controversial, to put it delicately. Bitumen trapped in the oil sands can only be turned into usable crude oil through a complicated process that involves removing the earth and steaming the molasses-like bitumen out of the sandy soil. While settlers have dreamed of striking black gold in Canada’s north for over a hundred years, it wasn’t until high oil prices and improved technology combined to make oil sands minding highly profitable: over 21 billion dollars was invested in the oil sands in 2011.</p>
<p>An entry-level, on-site worker at an oil sands plant will make around $100,000 per year to start, no college degree required. With so much money at stake, it’s likely no surprise that once relatively quiet, isolated communities in Canada’s far north have been inundated with industrial activity, transient laborers, and, even in the midst of a global recession, millions and millions of dollars.</p>
<p>What is it like to live in Canada’s oil country?</p>
<p>I want to tell you the stories of people like Flora Grandjambe, who, as the oldest member of the Fort McKay First Nation, remembers hunting for furs and living off the land in the boreal forest until she was 17; or Melissa Blake, the mayor of Fort McMurray, who hopes to transform Fort McMurray’s image into that of a beacon of sustainability in Canada’s North; or T.J, an engineer and refugee from Durundi’s civil war, who calls the oil sands “the world’s dirtiest oil” but also plans to work on-site as a truck driver for as long as he can, because, as he told me, the money is so good.</p>
<p>The politics and climate impact of the oil sands have been covered extensively in media around the world. But what I think is missing from this coverage is a deep, penetrating look at individual’s lives in the place where the mining is happening. I want to give these people’s voices a platform. With that goal, I am traveling to Fort McMurray for the third time with my friend Alex Nelson, a talented photographer, to conduct further interviews with those living under the shadow of the oil industry.</p>

<p><strong><em>What we need and what you get</em></strong></p>

<h3>Why This Book and Campaign?<br/>

Photographs of the difficult-to-find ringtails, baby cliff chipmunks, pronghorns, coyotes and so much more sat on his computer screen. Renowned wildlife photographer, Bruce D. Taubert, thought, “What I can do with these images to help other photographers enjoy Arizona’s wildlife as much as I do?”Then, a thought crossed his mind, “What if I shared my abundant knowledge and inspiring photographs of the most spectacular Arizona wildlife in a guidebook?"" That was his life's dream...but how?Bruce’s friend, Stan Bormann, encouraged him, ""Why don't you contact Colleen [Miniuk-Sperry] to publish it?""Karma struck and world’s collided! Colleen and Paul Gill had originally hoped to expand the “Wild in Arizona” book series.  So when Bruce called Colleen, it made perfect sense to expand our “Wild in Arizona” series to include wildlife. Let’s go for it! After almost three years of laboring and collaborating with a very talented wildlife photographer, Bruce's life dream is about to come true...
COMING SOON! The new guidebook:""Wild in Arizona: Photographing
Arizona's WILDLIFE!""But, We Won’t Be Able To Do It Without YOU!You can make it happen.  With your support, you will:
First and foremost, help make Bruce's dream come true!
Help you and other photographers, nature lovers, and students learn about, find, and photograph Arizona’s most spectacular animals.
Educate wildlife lovers about the important rules, regulations and etiquette required by Arizona Game and Fish, BLM and other agencies at various wildlife locations.
And finally, help pay for publishing.
How?  As valued supporters, you will received discounted books, eBooks, and exciting workshops by pre-ordering today!  With printing costs increasing, the cost for printing the book will be expensive—about $15,000.  We are turning towards our remarkably generous friends who enjoy photography and Arizona’s wildlife to help us cover $5,000 of the printing costs (a mere 1/3rd of the actual costs) so we can publish Bruce's book. THANK YOU sincerely for pitching in!  We will say it again: we won’t be able to do this without you!What's
This Book About?
Birds, butterflies, bison, and more,
oh my!
Our beautiful wildlife book features:

50 spectacular locations to find a broad diversity of
     animals to photograph across Arizona

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Napier Photo Collective involves fourth year photography students who, every year, come together to plan out an ambitious exhibition as part of the Free Range festival in London.<br/><br/>We are final year BA (Hons) Photography students, currently developing our degree show projects. These individual undertakings will encapsulate the last four years of our study at Edinburgh Napier University, incorporating the technical practice as well as critical skills acquired throughout our course. <br/>At the end of this academic year, we intend to take our graduate work to exhibit in London at The Free Range Graduate Art and Design exhibition, the largest of its kind, where universities from all across the United Kingdom will showcase their work. Throughout June and July, this space is host to graduates from creative degrees and, from the 21st to the 25th June 2018, we intend to display our work alongside other photography graduates from across the country. Free Range holds invaluable networking and exposure opportunities for both ourselves as individuals, as well as a group collectively representing Edinburgh Napier University.<br/>The work that will be exhibited at Free Range will offer a variety of stylistic approaches that represent the members of the collective, as well as the university as a whole, at the highest possible standard.</p>
<p>The funds raised during this campaign will be used to finance the production and transportation of our exhibition.</p>

<h3>Why We're Doing This</h3>
<p>LinaPilchard has been the voice of Betty since the first FNAB flash game was going to be a mere one-off parody. Then FNAB grew to it's own little cult phenomenon, and Lina's work progressed as a voice actress. We funded the Betty fursuit with the idea of making her a regular staple of who we are as a team, not just as a game parody character, but as a mascot. We always had the idea that, if we built her, Lina could potentially make a career out of being her. Photos, videos, collaborations with other sexy fursuit celebrities, Audio dramas, live video panels, and more.<br/>TFF is our starting boost, getting her out there in the fandom's public eye, meeting them, talking with them, and most importantly filming content for Lina's Patreon to keep them interested in her work long after the convention is over, and becoming a part of their lives in a positive way.<br/> </p>

<h2>Who The Heck Are You?</h2>
<p>My name is Cam Evans and I am a concert photographer born and raised in Sacramento, California. I got my start into photography when I was in high school and going into college. I photograph many subjects in between those times, but in my heart, I still felt lost into what I really wanted to do with photography until early 2017 I decided to take my camera to a local punk show and photograph said show. This was the point in my life where I knew I wanted to photograph concerts. Since then, I have photographed many do-it-yourself bands within the Sacramento and Bay Area music scene and much bigger acts like<i> KISS and Del The Funky Homosapien </i>(just to name a few); my work being featured in music magazines and blogs like <i>Sacramento News And Review, Maximum Rocknroll, and New Noise Magazine</i>. </p>
<h2>What The Heck Are You Doing With This Indiegogo?</h2>
<p>I am doing this Indiegogo to promote my new photo magazine <i>Girls Burn Boys</i>. It's a follow up to my last photo magazine <i>Sacramento Is Burning</i>, that focused on some the punk scene in Sacramento, California with bands and some of the crowd of the shows. <i>Girls Burn Boys </i>focuses on female musicians that I photographed within last year including both local and touring bands that come through Sacramento and the Bay Area.  <strong>The reason for the Indiegogo is to provide funding for the overhead cost of printing the magazine, the prints for those that pledge for it, and any Indiegogo fees</strong>. Like the last photo magazine, the printing of the magazine is going to be done through Blurb while the prints will be done through Mpix.</p>
<h2>When Is Girls Burn Boys Coming Out?</h2>
<p>For those that pledge Girls Burn Boys and all the rewards will be sent out around late November/ early December.  For everyone else, the link to order through Blurb's market place will be up <strong>early December</strong>.

<p>The destination will be announced within the coming days, but if by chance you do run a restaurant in Sacramento and you are willing to host people get in contact with me.  The dinner itself will take place on November 23. </p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Analogue Luxury is a brand that produces fine art, home goods, and merchandise inspired by the practice of taking authentic Polaroids and shooting 35mm disposable film. Our goal is to produce goods and content that will keep you inspired, intrigued,  and motivated. </p>
<p>My name is David Butler (DavehasWingz) - Over the past 7 years I have embarked on a journey in photography that has led me to this moment. Creating a brand and a space to bridge the gap between my past and present to create the future. I first began taking photos with a point and shoot digital camera in high school. Once in college I began to approach the craft as an art form and knew it would become a permanent part of my life. I graduated with a business degree in 2013 and returned home to Charlotte, NC and began working to positively contribute to the creative culture of the city. </p>

<p>I am looking to open the Analogue Luxury studio as a space that will be used not only as a proper showroom and design office for the brand but a place that gives business tools to creatives.

<p>Home decor and fine art can be tricky to sell - Patrons like to experience these items in a way to help the envision pieces in their space.

<p><strong>2. Workspace // Design Studio</strong></p>
<p>The future of Analogue Luxury is not limited to the production and distribution of tangible goods. There is an opportunity to provide creative services with a novel twist as we plan to apply the thought processes and aesthetic developed through working with analogue mediums. This space will serve as a headquarters for these operations. </p>
<p><strong>3.  Workshops // Gallery Space</strong></p>
<p>Artists and creatives need the opportunity to grow. Currently, Charlotte has no space that fosters the education and experiences for emerging artists.

<h3>Tanzania In-Focus </h3>
<p>The Tanzania In-Focus project is a collaborative photographic mission between United Planet, Photographers Without Borders and photographer Joshua Hobson.  All money raised will go towards the task of photographically documenting United Planets’ work in Tanzania.  </p>
<p>I have been selected and invited by Photographers Without Borders to participate in their Global Photography Service Program.  This specific program will take place for three weeks in Tanzania this fall. My task will be to travel to Tanzania, shadow an in-country volunteer for United Planet and document the important work they are doing there.  I will be documenting the development project of the volunteer, the interaction between the volunteer and their host family as well as the impact the project is making in the community of Dar es Salaam.

<h3>About the Charity</h3>
<p><strong>One of the largest foal rescue facilities in the US</strong>, Last Chance Corral (LCC) has been rescuing mistreated, unwanted, and misunderstood horses and foals for over 30 years.  Their work is absolutely critical for the 150+ foals that come into their care every year. As Victoria, the founder of LCC, <a href=""https://mashable.com/2015/06/14/last-chance-corral/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">puts it herself</a>, “We wanted to put our efforts into something that people don’t want to work with, which is newborns. <strong>We needed to at least give them a chance</strong>.” </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1556494518/nbmuzf5lgg7lhoxsr34b.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>LCC does amazing work and we are honored that they chose to partner with us at <a href=""https://artworktee.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ArtworkTee.com</a> to create this campaign. They were the official partner of Anthrohio last year, and so they have experience working with furries, and jumped at the chance to do so again.</p>

<p><strong>Your donation makes a real difference</strong> - The foaling season (lasting through June) is the most important time of year and the time of greatest need for the organization.  Your donation at this critical time means that they can <strong>rescue more foals and find them homes with loving caregivers</strong>.

<h3>Fundraising Goals</h3>
<p>Our initial goal is to raise $30,000 USD for Last Chance Corral. This enables them to hire additional staff, buy much-needed supplies, and save even more horses in need. </p>
<p>With this campaign, we are donating all profits to the charity, i.e. the amount raised minus the costs. These costs include things like card processing, fees which go to Indiegogo, and the costs to produce the rewards. We are keeping these costs as low as possible so that the maximum amount can be donated to LCC.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1555822562/cdf0ums51sii50qa6cjf.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The estimates in our graph are based on a quantity sold of approximately 1000 calendars.  The exact percentage will depend on a number of factors, such as number of units sold, the amount of stretch goals reached, and the number of calendars sold vs number of shirts. The percentage could vary up or down by about 10% depending on these factors. The graph above does not include shipping, because of the large variation in shipping costs to different regions. Regardless, we will work tirelessly to keep costs as low as possible so that LCC gets all the help we can give. Whenever there is an opportunity, we will reduce costs without compromising quality.</p>

<ul></ul>
<h3>Stretch Goals</h3>
<p>As we raise more money for Last Chance Corral, each calendar purchase will include even more great merch sponsored by several furry businesses (please note, this is for calendar purchases, not tshirt purchases). The more we raise, the more rewards you get, so make sure to share the campaign with your friends!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559889910/bpdslp8wriw0n4kslvtz.png"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559962707/xvhlxypmqqurngozclxv.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>For the stretch goals, depending on how many goals are reached, a number of small, fun items will be added to each calendar order. For each milestone, an additional item is added, like a sticker or postcard. The more we raise, the more you get!</p>
<p>Important: Please note that because the tshirts are fulfilled from a different location, the tshirt orders will not be affected by stretch goal rewards.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>To help keep problems to a minimum, we have completed the design work and made sure that all potential rewards are ready even before starting the campaign. The team of 5+ people who work for ArtworkTee.com are ready and willing to meet challenges that happen during the production or shipping process.  One of the most important considerations is keeping costs as low as possible - our goal is to keep the total costs of rewards to approximately 21% of the total donation amount or less. If unforeseen circumstances arise, such as a much higher price than quoted for the printing by our third party supplier, it is possible that the cost of rewards may be higher. If that is the case, we will do everything we can to lower the costs.  </p>
<p>We have made our estimates based on approximately 1000 calendars sold, and one risk/challenge is if a significantly lower or higher amount is sold. If a significantly lower amount (for example, 50-100 donations), then the cost per piece will be, unfortunately, higher than expected. If a significantly higher amount is sold, then even though it will result in much more money for LCC, it may take longer to fulfill the rewards, because of the small size of our team. If that is the case, we will bring on temporary workers and volunteers who can help package and ship the rewards to the donators.  Our team is highly skilled and experienced, having experience in inventory management and packaging from many years working at conventions. Whatever challenges arise, we will be able to overcome them.</p>

About the Charity
One of the largest foal rescue facilities in the US, Last Chance Corral (LCC) has been rescuing mistreated, unwanted, and misunderstood horses and foals for over 30 years.  Their work is absolutely critical for the 150+ foals that come into their care every year. As Victoria, the founder of LCC, puts it herself, “We wanted to put our efforts into something that people don’t want to work with, which is newborns. We needed to at least give them a chance.” 

LCC does amazing work and we are honored that they chose to partner with us at ArtworkTee.com to create this campaign. They were the official partner of Anthrohio last year, and so they have experience working with furries, and jumped at the chance to do so again.

Your donation makes a real difference - The foaling season (lasting through June) is the most important time of year and the time of greatest need for the organization.  Your donation at this critical time means that they can rescue more foals and find them homes with loving caregivers. You can learn more about the charity by visiting their website: http://lastchancecorral.org
Edit: The Last Chance Corral website is experiencing some server overload - We recommend that you take a look at their Facebook page while their server gets back online: https://www.facebook.com/LastChanceCorral/

 THE CHICken SERIESMatteo has always been fascinated by the beauty of birds and since boyhood has had a dream of flying. In 2013 he decided to go in search of a Cochin as a pet for his studio garden in Milan. He met a farmer who invited him to an aviary exhibition...That very same day, the Cochin hen Jessicah (cue Unchained Melody) stole his heart.Thanks to her, Matteo and Moreno surprisingly found themselves on this journey. That’s when the CHICken project was born.Beautiful Coffee Table Book
 The CHICken series was photographed in Italy at the Milano aviary exhibition. Many of the breeders were worried that the birds were not posed according to the breed standard. Instead, what they didn’t understand was just how well the birds had done their homework, they were natural born posers.
 
All of the chickens and roosters in this book are exemplary show birds. The photographic collection consists of more than 200 photos of 100 diverse types of chickens.The photographers wanted to capture them in their natural state of being with all its elegance.They were just themselves and had a natural ability to move in front of the camera. Some of them were photographed from the side, from behind or with only a glance over the shoulder. A NATURAL TALENT.

<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get </h2>
<h3><b>Impact of Your Support<br/></b></h3>
<p>By purchasing a copy of the book through this campaign, or otherwise supporting this project, you will help in the book's creation (and in the creation of the Geocaching Trail) for yourself and for others to enjoy too. </p>
<p>Funds will primarily cover:</p><ul>
<li>the cost of printing the book</li>
<li>the cost of aerial and ground photo missions</li>
<li>the costs of conducting historical research</li>
<li>as well as covering the expense associated with setting up the geocaching trail for others to follow. </li>
</ul><h3><b>About the Limited Edition Signed Books</b></h3>
<p>The photo books will be 200 to 300 full color pages, large format 12”H x 14”W, hardcover (with full-color dust jackets) with foil-stamped covers and spine. As of this writing, we plan to have the books produced by “EditionOneBooks.com”. They not only produce a high quality product, but were the only book publishers  we could find that would let us produce a limited run book this large at a cost that allows us to provide a reasonably priced product to sponsors, and to keep both of our arms and legs. ;-) </p>
<p>If we get 1 to 749 orders for physical books, they will be printed on digital presses. If we get over 749 orders for physical books, they will be printed on a traditional offset press – which further enhances the quality. </p>
<h3><b>About the Signed Photo Prints</b></h3>
<p>You will get to choose your favorite museum quality image for printing from a selected set of project images. The photo print will be about 20”x14” (exact size will vary a little bit in either or both dimensions, depending on image). </p>
<p>All of our prints are produced on state-of-the-art, professional-grade printers. Current print company, as of this writing, is Fine Art America (subject to change without notice). Acid-free papers and archival inks are used to guarantee that your prints last a lifetime without fading or loss of color.   Paper prints include a 1"" white border around the image to allow for future framing and matting and will be shipped in durable cardboard tubes. </p>
<h3><b>About the T-shirts</b></h3>
<p>T-shirts will be white, short sleeves, made of 100% cotton pre-shrunk with the image on the front. Size of your choice. </p>
<p>See below for image example:</p><p></p><p></p><p>

</center>
<p></p>This T-shirt Pic is for illustrative purposes only. Final Design(s) for the ""perk shirts"" will most likely differ from the above.<br/><br/><p></p>
<h3><b>Sponsor Recognition</b></h3>
<p>Campaign Sponsors, at all levels, will be recognized by a ""sponsor listing"" (with the exception of those that wish to remain anonymous) in the digital book and on the project website. ""Arts Patrons Sponsors"", will receive additional recognition in the printed book as well.</p><br/><p></p>
<h3><b>About the Geocaching Trail</b></h3>
<p>As we explore New Mexico 's sacred sites, churches, ceremonies, and the like we will leave a geocaching trail (all appropriate etiquette for establishing geocaches will be followed) with coordinates and hints provided in the digital materials. Geocaching coordinates will also be provided in the hard copy book too. Aside from being contained in the digital materials, coordinates and hints will be part of the regular email updates for paid-up customers, so you can start your adventures right away if you wish. </p>
<p>The caches will contain hand-made, glazed, clay tokens, and other things, and will be of varying levels of difficulty to get to, and to find – some will be very easy, some a little challenging, and some very hard. </p>
<p>Just as gold was a motivating factor for the Spaniards in their travels, so too will it be for our geocaching trail. Hidden amongst the geocaches will be 5 viles of <b>placer gold dust </b>. Each vile will contain about 1/10 of a gram of placer gold dust (worth about $5 each, as of this writing). Some of the caches will also contain <b>physical Bitcoin cards</b> of varying denominations as well.<br/></p>
<p>There will also be an <b> online database &amp; blog </b> that paid-up participants can log into to log their discoveries and share their stories – even if you aren't on the trail, you can log in an see what adventures are being had by other participants. </p>

<h2><b>Project Time Line </b></h2>
<h3><b>Collecting Information, Imagery, &amp; Laying the Geocaches </b></h3>
<p>Though some work has already been done, there is still much to do. We estimate 7 to 11 months will be needed (depending on weather, and in some cases getting permissions) to complete our travels, finish the photography, and lay the geocaches. </p>
<h3><b>Book Production </b></h3>
<p>After the photo-expeditions are finished, and the geocaches are laid, it should take about 6 to 9 weeks to finish up the book and get a proof copy back from the printer. If all goes well with the proof, then it should take about 3 to 9 weeks after the proof is approved (depending on # of copies) to get delivery of the print run. After which I will sign and mail out books as quickly as possible for those that purchased the hard cover photo book. </p>
<h3><b>Signed Prints </b></h3>
<p>After the travels are finished, participants that paid for the Signed prints will receive an email with a link to a selection of photos to choose from. Orders for prints will be placed as responses are received. Photo Print orders are generally received from the printer within 5 to 10 business days. We will sign the backs of print orders as they come in and mail them back out as quickly as possible, generally in a “first in first out” basis. </p>
<h3>
<b> </b><b>You will Receive Stuff throughout the Duration of the Project! </b>
</h3>
<p>There will be regular online updates throughout the life project, ranging from geocaching coordinates and hints, to photos &amp; videos, as well as the option to purchase neat little project related products like mugs, T-shirts, cards, stamps, etc… </p>
<h3><b>What if the Desired Funding Goal is not Reached? Every bit helps!</b></h3>
<p>If the desired funding goal is not met, it will simply limit the scope and coverage of the project. So, there will still be an adventure to be had, a geocaching trail laid, digital materials produced, as well as a book, it will simply be at a different scale of coverage if the desired funding level goal is not reached. We also have a ""Plan-B"" -- i.e. we will also  be seeking some commercial advertising sponsors along the way, so that should also help move the project along as well if the desired funding goal is not reached.</p>

</center></div>","Summary: 
Photography and travel is a gateway to learning about the world around you. “New Mexico Gods” (NMG) is a geocaching, photo-safari adventure exploring New Mexico 's spiritual places – from ancient Native American Indian sites, to old Christian Churches , to outdoor ceremonies that connect past and present. 
The materials collected and developed from our travels throughout New Mexico will culminate in a limited edition, high quality, hardcover photo book  with digital supplementary materials  containing even more photos, videos, and historical information. 
For the adventurous, and curious . . . along the way, we will  leave a geocaching trail ; to better share the journey with those that may wish to follow and explore the wide open spaces, the ancient ruins, the buildings, the churches, the cities and towns, and last but not least connect with the past and the people of the present to better share in the wonder of all that is.

<h3>Photography By MacGregor : A dude reborn</h3>
<p> I'm Andrew MacGregor and this is my rags to riches and back to rags story. I didn't really have the best childhood. I was bullied, isolated, Didn't have many friends and thus kept to myself a great deal. I felt the call of the artist but had never really found the medium that best suited me.  I picked up my first camera simply to put photos of my paintings (which were terrible, btw) online. After that it went back into the box where the dust started to gather. Took it back out to document a pretty spectacular winter we were having and a few weeks later I was getting money for my first commissioned gig. Shortly after that I was living in my car setting out on one hell of an adventure to rebuild my life. My camera and small bag of gadgets were all i had. After two years i was moving into my first apartment.  Photography was paying my bills and keeping a roof over my head.  What else it did was give me a reason to exist. Finally i found my medium. I could express myself artistically in a way that truly benefited others.  Let me share a little story.  When I was younger, maybe 13 years old, all i wanted was to be a writer. That didn't change for nearly 15 years.  Sure I came up with few story ideas, but i never got further than a few chapters into any project. I was an aspiring writer that could never find the time or energy to actually.... write.  Then I found photography. And for 8 years not a day went by where I didn't actively partake in something photo related. Whether it was going out on a shoot, reading a book/magazine, or watching a video tutorial on how to better my craft. Going to workshops, galleries, following others in the field to both learn from and appreciate.  I saturated myself with it. Any chance i could, I'd drink up more and more knowledge. It became the most important thing in my life.</p>
<ul>
<li>This campaign came about because everything above did not have a happy ending. 2-3 years ago I left the entirety of my gear unattended and it was stolen. I loved working for myself but I was no businessman. I focused on the clients and the photos. It never dawned on me to get insurance on my equipment.  That is a mistake i've lived with all this time.  To struggle your entire life being told you're not good enough. Being treated as inferior. Having a story to tell but no one that would listen. Then to finally find the thing you were meant to do. The thing that made you feel validated and confident. The thing that gave you a voice to express yourself with. To suddenly have that taken...Kinda sucks. Suffice it to say i feel in to a dark depression and have been barely getting by since.  The reason for this campaign is twofold. One, to get back my successful business and do the work i was put here to do. Two, to get back the confidence, happiness, and sense of purpose that was taken.</li>
<li>I think its important to emphasize that people donating  aren't just helping a guy get back his picture gadgets, You're helping to restore his church, his spirit, his creativity , his mental health. Photography wasn't just a job. it was my religion, my zen, my art, and my therapy.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>In order to explain what I'm asking for, i feel its important to explain what was stolen.<br/>In my Photog crate was about $13,000 worth of gear. Nikon D4 ($6k) a couple 2.8 Lenses ($2k each) Lighting set ($2k) and another 1,000+ in random accessories.</li>
<li>What I'm asking for is not $13,000. I'm asking for $6,000. Flexible Funded which i'll explain in a moment.</li>
<li>The Perks are going to be a work in progress. <br/>Its difficult to assess perks when your campaign isn't about producing a finished product. BUT,  i got some good news on that front. I've enlisted the help of some of my best friends who happen to be incredible tattoo artists to design some super cool merch (a first for Photography by MacGregor) We're talkin T-shirts, Buttons, Stickers,  Posters.<br/>Speaking of posters, Contributors will be able to select images from a catalog and have posters made and sent right to there door.  That takes care of the people in the nose bleed sections. Maybe i can go a little further for my locals , im thinking  discounted or even FREE photo shoots based on amount donated.  Like I said, lots of details to hash out. This is a start.</li>
<li>As i mentioned earlier, I'm doing Flexible Funding on this campaign. I chose this because my goals can be broken up into intervals. While i am setting my sights on that $6000.00 mark. A lot can be done for less.  <br/>Full disclosure, It took me 3 years but I've saved up $2k. If i can hit $1800.00, I get a Nikon D850, <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1510393361/zfpmpvswuprlkpcgeryf.jpg"" src=""""/>

</div></div>","Photography By MacGregor : A dude reborn
 I'm Andrew MacGregor and this is my rags to riches and back to rags story. I didn't really have the best childhood. I was bullied, isolated, Didn't have many friends and thus kept to myself a great deal. I felt the call of the artist but had never really found the medium that best suited me.  I picked up my first camera simply to put photos of my paintings (which were terrible, btw) online. After that it went back into the box where the dust started to gather. Took it back out to document a pretty spectacular winter we were having and a few weeks later I was getting money for my first commissioned gig. Shortly after that I was living in my car setting out on one hell of an adventure to rebuild my life. My camera and small bag of gadgets were all i had. After two years i was moving into my first apartment.  Photography was paying my bills and keeping a roof over my head.  What else it did was give me a reason to exist. Finally i found my medium. I could express myself artistically in a way that truly benefited others.  Let me share a little story.  When I was younger, maybe 13 years old, all i wanted was to be a writer. That didn't change for nearly 15 years.  Sure I came up with few story ideas, but i never got further than a few chapters into any project. I was an aspiring writer that could never find the time or energy to actually.... write.  Then I found photography. And for 8 years not a day went by where I didn't actively partake in something photo related. Whether it was going out on a shoot, reading a book/magazine, or watching a video tutorial on how to better my craft. Going to workshops, galleries, following others in the field to both learn from and appreciate.  I saturated myself with it. Any chance i could, I'd drink up more and more knowledge. It became the most important thing in my life.

This campaign came about because everything above did not have a happy ending. 2-3 years ago I left the entirety of my gear unattended and it was stolen. I loved working for myself but I was no businessman. I focused on the clients and the photos. It never dawned on me to get insurance on my equipment.  That is a mistake i've lived with all this time.  To struggle your entire life being told you're not good enough. Being treated as inferior. Having a story to tell but no one that would listen. Then to finally find the thing you were meant to do. The thing that made you feel validated and confident. The thing that gave you a voice to express yourself with. To suddenly have that taken...Kinda sucks. Suffice it to say i feel in to a dark depression and have been barely getting by since.  The reason for this campaign is twofold. One, to get back my successful business and do the work i was put here to do. Two, to get back the confidence, happiness, and sense of purpose that was taken.
I think its important to emphasize that people donating  aren't just helping a guy get back his picture gadgets, You're helping to restore his church, his spirit, his creativity , his mental health. Photography wasn't just a job. it was my religion, my zen, my art, and my therapy.


What We Need & What You Get

In order to explain what I'm asking for, i feel its important to explain what was stolen.In my Photog crate was about $13,000 worth of gear. Nikon D4 ($6k) a couple 2.8 Lenses ($2k each) Lighting set ($2k) and another 1,000+ in random accessories.
What I'm asking for is not $13,000. I'm asking for $6,000. Flexible Funded which i'll explain in a moment.
The Perks are going to be a work in progress. Its difficult to assess perks when your campaign isn't about producing a finished product. BUT,  i got some good news on that front. I've enlisted the help of some of my best friends who happen to be incredible tattoo artists to design some super cool merch (a first for Photography by MacGregor) We're talkin T-shirts, Buttons, Stickers,  Posters.Speaking of posters, Contributors will be able to select images from a catalog and have posters made and sent right to there door.  That takes care of the people in the nose bleed sections. Maybe i can go a little further for my locals , im thinking  discounted or even FREE photo shoots based on amount donated.  Like I said, lots of details to hash out. This is a start.
As i mentioned earlier, I'm doing Flexible Funding on this campaign. I chose this because my goals can be broken up into intervals. While i am setting my sights on that $6000.00 mark. A lot can be done for less.  Full disclosure, It took me 3 years but I've saved up $2k. If i can hit $1800.00, I get a Nikon D850, 

not as high end as my D4 (well techincally today it would be a D5 ) but a stellar piece to get me up and running.  With just the Camera a fair amount of jobs open to me. 
If I hit another $1800.00 then I can get my main work horse lens, Nikon 24-70 f2.8  (if i don't quite hit the second 1800 tier, i'd go for a third party equivalent. Tamron or Sigma) 

Camera + Lens opens up even more job opportunities.And if i can reach the goal then I'd also purchase a lighting set up and I'd be back to where i was 2-3 years ago just using less expensive versions of everything.  
Trying to keep things in perspective, Its daunting to think I'm trying to raise 2k or 4k or 6k. But I can rap my head around 240 people with $25 of disposable money to help a guy reclaim his dream.


The Impact
I made my career and reputation around giving high quality work for an affordable price. I undercut most locals.  And aloud people that couldn't typically afford the services of a professional photographer a break. I lile to think I improved the quality of life of most if not all of my clients by showing them how beautiful they were.

Over time, these blind spots enlarge and merge to produce tunnel vision. In some cases of Usher Syndrome, vision is further impaired by clouding of the lens of the eye (cataracts).

<p>A little back story:</p>
<p>Okay rewind back to 2005 I was 19 and doing my own thing, my wife had just moved to Canada from China and was with her mother and father. Once they got to Canada they took her mother straight to the hospital as she wasn't feeling good just before they left China and that is when they found out she had ovarian cancer, after about 3 weeks her mom started getting extremely sick so her dad flew her back to China figuring that it would be the best solution, about 2 years later her mom passed away in hospital. <br/><br/>Fast forward 2010 my wife and I had just gotten married and were planning on making a trip out to China, so I could finally meet her dad and the rest of the family. It was in October during the world fair and golden week (big nation holiday in China that lasts 2 weeks....a lot of people have time off during that time) when we got there to do a traditional Chinese reception (for the grooms that means you get very drunk and very fast) anyways back to the story, that is when we found out her dad had just gone through leukemia treatment for having hodgkin lymphoma type B (yes that is a type of cancer for those of you who don't know). Now her dad is still alive but the cancer has come back which is a big concern for us and this is what type of dilemma I deal with on my own personal basis everyday.<br/></p>

My name is Joseph Richardson and I work with Triple J Revealed Imagery when this Idea just came to my mind.

The main cost is getting the calendars made which is about $10 per calendar, the other $5.00 will be going to the Canadian Cancer Society and Alberta ride to conquer cancer.  The biggest perk is your helping a great cause and you get a calendar full of very talented cosplayers.  The funds will still be going to the same place, naturally as we get more of these calendars sold the cheaper the calendars become for manufacturing.

  The Impact 
It gets the word cosplay out there more and it's going to help a great cause! 
  Risks & Challenges 
The biggest challenge that I have faced so far is getting the cosplay models to work around their schedules to help out. There really is no risks unless my camera randomly breaks then that could pose a slight problem......
Making the Deadline seems like a tough task with organizing all the photo shoots with these cosplayers!

<p>During one week in March of 2017, I was having problems with my sleep schedule and kept waking up at 4 A.M.. Each morning I would wake to this incredible stillness, seeming like all life and activity had been halted or something. This reoccurrence caused me to think about 4 A.M.. After pondering, asking a few friends, and looking up information about it, it is the hour of day in which the most people are asleep. It is the hour in which both the night owls (who typically fall asleep by 3) and the early birds (who wake at 5) are asleep. Even if one is awake at 4, like I was during that week of insomnia, they are usually inside or in bed. The only people who are awake at this hour, are the individuals who have to be (farmers, postal workers, etc.), so most of us probably do not know what is happening at this time of day.</p>
<p>I have been developing my skills as a photographer for about 8 months now, and I am at the point in which I am ready to make my first body of work. I want to show people what they may not normally see. I am planning to create multiple 4 A.M. series, in which I go out between the times of 4 and 5 a.m. and shoot photos of what is going on in different places. For my first, I want to make it in the town of Sharon Springs, NY. Sharon is a unique town that I grew up going to, so it is sentimental to me. It is a place that has the combination of small town kitschiness and beautiful scenery, and I think it is the perfect first place to capture what is happening at this unique time of day.</p>
<p>My timeline for this series goes as follows:</p>
<p>-Shoot photos between the times of 4 A.M. and 5 A.M. in Sharon Springs during June of 2017.</p>
<p>-Design the book that compiles this first photo series during July and the first few weeks of August of 2017.</p>
<p>-Manufacture copies of the book by the end of September of 2017.</p>
<p><strong><u>Funds</u></strong></p>

<p>As far as funding goes, I am putting everything that I can into making this project happen. </p>
<p><strong>I am looking for funds to:</strong></p>

<p>-Create high quality <strong>prints</strong> of these photographs to <strong>display</strong>,</p>
<p>-Provide a well-designed and well-printed <strong>book</strong> of my first formal photo series (Hopefully Hard-cover)</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>With <em>Rebellion</em> festival being the world’s largest punk rock music festival I feel it would make an excellent subject for a “coffee table” style book combining my photographic output with a history of Rebellion and interviews with the artists and fans that make this such an important event on the Punk Rock calendar. Also, with the world climate the way it is at the moment, punk rock is making a huge comeback which warrants such a publication for the punk community to have their say!</p>
<p>Having always wantied to attend this festival, I’ve found it next to impossible to fund from my Antipodes home in New Zealand. But I am determined to make it for 2013 through a crowd-funding effort and with the anticipated support of the festival organisers. And, if I’m going to do it, why not do it in style and produce a book about it?</p>
<p>I’m blessed with the fact that, having been on the local Punk scene for many years, I’ve already met many of the artists as they toured New Zealand and we’ve always got on famously. I feel they would be highly supportive of a documentary book on the festival.</p>
<p>I am currently researching an independent publishing house to provide the physical publication and anticipate it could be distributed world-wide through  various independent DIY distros such as<em>Profane Existence</em> in the US, Sudden Death in Canada (I’m sure Joey Shithead will throw his weight behind it) and maybe someone like Shellshock or Rough Trade in the UK/Europe. If the project comes to fruition, 50% of the proceeds from sales would go to Rebellion Festivals or their nominated charity in the punk community.</p>
<p>Thanks to phase I of this campaign I've essentially covered most of my airfares so this phase I'm looking for funds to offset publishing costs!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><span>Essentially, I need travel expenses and publication costs covered and, depending on your contribution, you'll get a credit in the book minimum. See the perk list.</span></p>

I need to upgrade to a Nikon D500 camera which I am buying used for 1400$ from Ebay.
This is one of the best wildlife cameras on the market.
If I don't reach my goal I will sell some of my possessions to make up the difference.


The Impact
 

During the Pandemic we all need a little joy. Your contribution will help me capture even better images to share with the world.
I successfully had a campaign last year that allowed me to upgrade my lens

But, does photographers make money there when we look at their awesome shots? No, no one is paying them for viewing their photos! I want change this by launching Photo Monetization Network PicsRox.com - a photo sharing and influence marketing platform allowing photographers and influencers monetize photos from native advertising sharing posts via their followers and using hashtags to reach worldwide audience. Proof of Concept is available now at PicsRox.com!What is the concept of #PicsRox startup?

Let photographers tell stories to engage people to action: - go for offers, like, share, discuss or see more related photos

Let photos work for money - get paid each time photo has been viewed and engaged people to action

Let photos engage people on different social networks who- follow photographers and influencers- follow or browse hashtags
How it will work?
Advertiser set budget, register hashtag and offers

Photographers take and share photos with personal messages and hashtags to influence engagement of followers

Influencers share posts made by photographers to influence engagement of followers

Followers and their friends discover offers in shared photos and messages
Explorers search points and topics of interest by hashtags and discover offers in amazing pictures and engaging discussions
For example?
Photo I taken at Lido restaurant with my personal message to friends and followers on Tumblr


post shared by me for my friends on Facebook
Pin on PinterestWhy native advertising?Interest to native advertising is growing and I believe that advertisers in partnership with photographers and influencers who have many followers could easily benefit from this. What I did so far?
I created proof of concept website and filling it now with photos. The website is blog on Tumblr.com so you can access posts from Tumblr's apps for Android and iOS mobile devices as well. Please visit PicsRox.com and PicsRox blog using Tumblr's mobile apps to learn more.
What I will do with collected funds even don’t reach my entire goal?
spend on development of platform for counting hits and billing (major part of funds) and also native mobile apps for Android and iOS to interface directly with created blog on Tumblr.com.
How much time development may take?
about 4 months if I reach entire goal, but may take longer if notI would appreciate you for sharing PicsRox.com campaign that help spreading the word about new PicsRox's way of monetizing photos.I believe your contribution and spreading the word to your friends will help me introduce to the world the new, fair and helpful way of native advertising.Thank you for your help.Your Germans Ribakovs and PicsRox.com#PicsRox#LetYourPhotosWorkForYou#NativeAdvertising#RevenueSharing",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>We are two people from different backgrounds: Oxalis from Indonesia and Maarten from the Netherlands. In our project “Supper Snapshots”, we both took a photo of our food every day and posted them on our blog. The project was started as an experiment: to see how our backgrounds influenced our eating patterns. Inevitably, our backgrounds did not only influence our culinary preferences, but also our photographic styles.<br/><br/>In the beginning we merely documented our meals, but as time went on we explored both more gastronomic and photographic possibilities. Some photos are staged, others highly improvised, and most of them have a playful and spontaneous character. Have a look at <a href=""http://suppersnapshots.blogspot.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">suppersnapshots.blogspot.com</a>!<br/><br/>This project ran for two full years, and resulted in a collection of 1,468 photos. Among them are some gems that deserve better presentations than merely being 400x300-pixel images on the blog... After a small and successful photo exhibition in Bandung’s Common Room last year we will exhibit our finest selection of Supper Snapshots in the near future: in That’s Life Coffee cafe in Jakarta and the C2O library in Surabaya.<br/><br/>Two centrepieces of the exhibition are cooperations with Studiomili, a design studio from Jakarta, who will enrich the photos with their drawings - creating two mixed-media artworks where photography and illustration meet. <br/><br/>We need you to realise those exhibitions, but we’re not simply asking for money: by contributing, you can receive all kinds of rewards. Depending on the donation amount you can buy postcards, quality photo prints to hang on your wall, photobooks and more -- all of them are carefully selected from the best photos in our collection. Additionally, the names of all contributors will be mentioned in the best-of photobooks.<br/><br/>We will start sending rewards to all contributors after the opening of the first exhibition early February.<br/><br/>Don't have a paypal account? You can donate with your credit card via paypal without requiring a paypal account. Take the following steps:</p>
<p><span>&gt; When you get to the PayPal screen, you'll see up top ""Choose a Way to Pay""</span><br/><span>&gt; Select the second option: ""Pay with a debit or credit card""</span><br/><span>&gt; Complete the form</span><br/><span>&gt; When you get to the checkbox that says: ""Save this information with a PayPal account..."", **uncheck** the box.</span><br/><span>&gt; Click ""review and continue"" to continue with a payment using a credit card.</span><br/><span>&gt; Click on the ""continue without logging in"" link</span></p>

<p> </p></div>","About the project
We are two people from different backgrounds: Oxalis from Indonesia and Maarten from the Netherlands. In our project “Supper Snapshots”, we both took a photo of our food every day and posted them on our blog. The project was started as an experiment: to see how our backgrounds influenced our eating patterns. Inevitably, our backgrounds did not only influence our culinary preferences, but also our photographic styles.In the beginning we merely documented our meals, but as time went on we explored both more gastronomic and photographic possibilities. Some photos are staged, others highly improvised, and most of them have a playful and spontaneous character. Have a look at suppersnapshots.blogspot.com!This project ran for two full years, and resulted in a collection of 1,468 photos. Among them are some gems that deserve better presentations than merely being 400x300-pixel images on the blog... After a small and successful photo exhibition in Bandung’s Common Room last year we will exhibit our finest selection of Supper Snapshots in the near future: in That’s Life Coffee cafe in Jakarta and the C2O library in Surabaya.Two centrepieces of the exhibition are cooperations with Studiomili, a design studio from Jakarta, who will enrich the photos with their drawings - creating two mixed-media artworks where photography and illustration meet. We need you to realise those exhibitions, but we’re not simply asking for money: by contributing, you can receive all kinds of rewards. Depending on the donation amount you can buy postcards, quality photo prints to hang on your wall, photobooks and more -- all of them are carefully selected from the best photos in our collection. Additionally, the names of all contributors will be mentioned in the best-of photobooks.We will start sending rewards to all contributors after the opening of the first exhibition early February.Don't have a paypal account? You can donate with your credit card via paypal without requiring a paypal account. Take the following steps:
> When you get to the PayPal screen, you'll see up top ""Choose a Way to Pay""> Select the second option: ""Pay with a debit or credit card""> Complete the form> When you get to the checkbox that says: ""Save this information with a PayPal account..."", **uncheck** the box.> Click ""review and continue"" to continue with a payment using a credit card.> Click on the ""continue without logging in"" link

My photo topics are often People, Nature, Sports and in a broad sense, cultural and social diversity.

Walking Around - The Journey 
The main goal from this campaign will be traveling around the world during a year minimum and cross North America, Central and South America, Oceania, Asia, Africa and at last Europe, starting from February, 2014.
To accomplish this plan I must reach the 16000€ goal. If i get 100% funded or more I will be able to make this trip last longer, until 2 years. If not, the journey will be made in less time and cross less countries/continents but I'LL ALWAYS BE MADE!

<h3>
<span style=""font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: 0px;"">Lets start from the beginning.</span><br/>
</h3>
<p>Roughly 9 years ago I was diagnosed with Cystic Fibrosis. I was considered, to put it mildly, a very unique case since I was quite older and never really presented any major symptoms.</p>
<p><b>Since CF is a fatal disease with NO KNOWN CURE,</b> I was a bit of a medical anomaly. It’s only until VERY recently that half of all CF patients are now over the age of 18.</p>
<p>As a few years went by, I became increasing frustrated that the dialogue of CF was very juvenile, focusing more on parents and children. I realized I’m probably not alone in felling this way, <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">so I embarked on my first photography project: JUST BREATHE. This focused on adults living with CF, and their particular issues, problems, emotions, etc. <b>Book #1.</b></span></p>
<p>It was during the making of this first book I started hearing about other issues among adults, specifically among WOMEN with Cystic Fibrosis. It was after hearing enough of these stories that <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I decided to work on the second book: SALTYGIRLS. Well now… at first this caused quite a stir, because a small few just didn’t quite get the concept yet. But as the project grew, it became</span></p>
<p>a snowball that turned into a massive avalanche. By the summer of 2015 - even before the book was out - the SaltyGirls Idea went viral around the world (just see the list of media outlets below <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">that covered it). We are all extremely proud of what we accomplished. <b>Book #2.</b></span></p>
<p>Like a good movie trilogy, it’s now time to move on to the 3rd book. Officially, its called FAMILIES: THE SALTYKIDS PROJECT FOR CYSTIC FIBROSIS.</p>
<p>But we’ll just refer it as <b>SALTYKIDS</b> from here on in.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.saltykidsproject.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.saltykidsproject.com</a><br/></p>
<p>(fyi - new video coming soon)</p>

<p>AND HOW MUCH PRESS DID WE GET IN 2015???? Check out just some of the media outlets that covered SaltyGirls. I think SaltyKids can be even bigger!!! We got over 1 million hits on Buzzfeed!!!!</p>

<br/><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p>The fundraising will be divided into 2 parts. The first will be THIS initial campaign to raise a bit of funds to get on the road to get some families photographed. Like the SaltyGirls, there is a critical mass of photos that have to be attained before people REALLY pay attention. Thats what this initial push will be for.<br/></p>
<p>Cystic Fibrosis is usually diagnosed right at birth. It is a lifelong disease. In the US, the median age of someone with CF is their early 40s. But with the advancement of current <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">treatments and the promise of genetic cures coming, we are literally on the cusp of an actual cure. Those diagnosed with CF today have a bright future ahead. But that future is still filled </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">with bumps along the way… bumps that the entire Family has to endure. And taking a large brunt of this - emotionally, financially - are the parents raising a child with CF. </span></p>
<p>That is what this project will be focused on. The daily trials and tribulations - as well as hopes and dreams - of those Families.</p>

Después de esa oscura noche, Estamos buscando todas las maneras posibles para poder recuperarnos. Es aquí donde necesitamos su ayuda. 

Somos Josue Bonilla y Jacob Valencia, (@josuebonillaph y @jakes_tapes) dos jóvenes fotógrafos que perdieron todo excepto la esperanza de seguir adelante y cumplir nuestros sueños.
Buscamos la forma en la que nos puedan ayudar a seguir adelante y demostrarle al mundo que no nos vamos a rendir.
Cualquier contribución, por más pequeña que sea, nos impulsa a trabajar más duro por nuestra meta. Cada grano de arena se puede convertir en una inmensa playa.

 
 

En lo que nos pueden ayudar y lo que damos a cambio.

Las perdidas estan alrededor de los 15.000 dolares, nuestra meta es llegar a los 12.000
El 10% de todo lo que sea recaudado será donado.
Le ofreceremos a cada donante un retrato profesional en muestra de agradecimiento.
Así recaudemos 1 peso, el 10% se irá a una fundación y el resto se invertira en en la recuperacion de los equipos para poder seguir trabajando con la mejor calidad.

<font size=""2"">I

project  with the working title ""Selling and Making"".</font><br/><font size=""2"">I
am a photographer based in London, UK and from 2007 until 2013 I
worked on this project photographing small scale, specialist
businesses and their owners here in this city. It was a personal
project to which I added slowly whenever I came across another person
or business that made me curious and which I wanted to let people
know about. <br/><br/></font><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/54800/files/20130905095315-indiegogosample.jpg?1378399995"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<font size=""2""><b>Why<br/></b>In our mass consumption chain store culture individual craftsmanship and personal attention are rare. Nonetheless London’s specialist businesses survive persisting in a way of doing business which is in stark contrast to impersonal corporate culture. The long term dedication and often hard and mundane day to day of these businesses does not correspond to the life and career aspirations of many in our fast paced society. But here shop room, goods and shopkeeper, workshop, tools and artisan merge their characteristics in time and personal histories have a tangible connection with the physical spaces inhabited. This linking between identity, space and occupation is at the heart of this book I want to make. I believe this type of small, individualist commerce is necessary and valuable and want to draw attention to it's decline but also to it's survival despite the odds.<font size=""2""></font><br/></font><br/><font size=""2""><b>The
project so far<br/></b>I have photographed close to 30 businesses and am
working on an edit of about 24 for the book. There are portraits and
interior photographs as well as a short text about each person and
business based on my conversations and observations gathered during
my visits to the shops and workshops. </font>
<br/><br/><font size=""2""><b>The
Plan<br/></b>The most important part of the work, the gatheri<font size=""2"">ng of the content</font>, is done but making a
book is expensive and I need to raise money in order to pay for the
production. I have great team of people involved who will help me
make this a beautiful and relevant book that will resonate in this
time when the places as well as the people I have photographed are becoming more and more of a
rarity: Dawn Lyon will contribute an introduction which will put the
images and stories into the wider context of the changing nature of
work and commerce. Mel Duarte will do the design beautifully and
elegantly. And the wonderful Karen McQuaid, curator at The
Photographers' Gallery, will help with the final edit of the images.</font> The book will be printed in an edition of 500 and will be published through my publishing platform Paper Tigers Books.<br/><br/><br/><h3><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></h3>

only a small part of the money I need to produce this book the way I

<br/>The costs I need to cover over all are mainly for

have received a few quotes and from these the estimated cost for the

this project a fair fee for their work. This is the part I am hoping
to cover with the funds raised here.<br/><br/><b>What happens if I raise less money?</b><br/>There are of course ways to produce this book with

WhyIn our mass consumption chain store culture individual craftsmanship and personal attention are rare.
