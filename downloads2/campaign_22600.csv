<h3>The Idea.</h3>
<p>We want to create a colorful and artistic dance cover of the song Boy With Luv by BTS. Taking stylistic inspiration from the ARMY with Luv music video version, we will film in beautiful locations around the Seattle area. This Indiegogo campaign will help offset costs for equipment and permit fees for our crew, who are donating their time &amp; expertise to the project to add to their film portfolios.</p>
<h3>The Crew.</h3>
<p>Our director and cinematographer for the video are Shelby Bowen and Preston Standiferd - two local filmmakers in the Seattle area. Each attended Seattle Film Institute and have experience working on several different types of projects - from short films to dance covers.<br/>""Our ultimate goal with everything we create is to share human stories and connect the people around us. We'll be bringing on people we've both worked with in the past in order to make this project successful!""</p>
<h3><strong>The Dancers.</strong></h3>
<p>The dance project is led by Mitch LeSage, who has performed in many kpop dance covers and competitions and has led dance workshops and other events in the Seattle kpop community. Joining Mitch are Samantha and Vanessa, who have been a part of dance covers and workshops in the past, and have worked long and hard to bring Boy With Luv to life.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need.</h3>
<p>Now it's time for the nitty gritty. The budget. We sat down and planned out three different tiers, depending on how much funding we're able to work with -- a base, a median and the ideal. We're obviously hoping to be fully funded so that we can make this project everything we want it to be, but we're prepared with back-ups in the event that doesn't happen. Your donations will be going toward the following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Equipment rentals</p></li>
<li><p>Location permits/fees</p></li>
<li><p>Insurance</p></li>
<li><p>On-set food &amp; water for dancers and crew</p></li>
<li><p>In the (miraculous) event that we are over-funded, all residual funds will be donated to UNICEF in BTS' name.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>What You Get.</h3>
<p>Every single person that makes a donation toward this project will be listed in the credits of our project, as well as a video message from the crew to say thank you. We'll also be looking for extras, so if you're in the Seattle area, keep your ear out for our casting call!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>If you aren't able to donate, you can help by simply spreading the word about our campaign!</div></div>","The Idea.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>This play is something one could call a culmination of our friendship so far: we've always been united by our common philosophical and artistic interests, especially where really weird abstract stuff is concerned, and we've worked on many theatrical projects together, but this is the first one that's totally us. <br/><br/>""Cataclysms"" is a play about two friends trying to connect to each other while a seemingly insurmountable gap, filled to the brim with surrealistic horrors, spreads out between them. With it, we are marking what our friendship has achieved, and imagining what human connection, in general, can achieve.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Obviously art is expensive: theatre especially so because it so often has a menagerie of moving parts attached to it. We have over twenty props and costume pieces to use throughout this show, and the purchase of all those props is right now coming out of our own pockets. Our hope with this campaign is to defray the cost of these props and also to save money for future artistic projects like this one.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Both of us have put out weird works that have to do with people on the margins of society, and we feel like people suffering from Mental Health definitely count in that category. Our hopeful impact with this is to chip away at the stigma surrounding mental health conversations and encourage the people who see it to reach out to others, regardless of what side of this issue they stand on.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you're broke like us, no biggie! You can help us in these ways:</p>
<p>1. If you live in ABQ: Help us out with props or costumes! Hit us up by email and we'll let you know what small items we are currently lacking and you let us know where we can find 'em.</p>
<p>2. If you don't live in ABQ: Share this with your friends! HELP US DROWN IN FAME or whatever.</p>

Since 2007, founders Liz White, Sky Seals &amp; Kristin Skye Hoffmann (all alumni from the University of Northern Colorado) have been driving Wide Eyed to produce terrific independent theatre for the artistic community of New York City.  Producing prolifically from day one, the company is currently dedicated to the exclusive focus upon new works by emerging playwrights.  So committed are we to this cause that we decided to go back to our roots and bring some of our work to the Denver theatre community.  </p>
<p>This fall, we will proudly present the Colorado premiere of <em><strong><em>theMumblings</em></strong></em> by Dan Kitrosser, Wide Eyed's Resident Playwright.  This beautiful two-person production follows JODIE and ALLEN, a charming couple with a bit of an unconventional arrangement.  You see, JODIE is straight and ALLEN is gay. They are best friends and they are married.  Join them as they show you what events in their lives led to this most perfect union as they play out other characters from one another's past. This subtly dark and very funny tale first premiered at the New York International Fringe Festival (FringeNYC) to critical acclaim.  </p>
<p>Starring original Wide Eyed Productions company member and current Denver resident Lauren Bahlman, UNC alumnus Lanny Boyer, and directed by Wide Eyed's Artistic Director, Kristin Skye Hoffmann, this production is sure to be a special addition to the artistic landscape of the great city of Denver.  </p>

</div>
<h3>A Note from the Director <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">about theMumblings </span>
</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>Playwright Dan Kitrosser gets people.  I’ve known him for a while and, in that time,
I’ve been privileged enough to work on several of his plays. In each play, the
evidence is there: Dan understands what
humans are all about, and he puts that divine understanding in all his
work.  He is sneaky about it,
though.  He distracts you with humor or a
story or a theatrical device that makes you think you’re in for something
usual, something you’d expect to see at the theatre.  Then, with stealth and strategic methodology,
he holds a mirror up to each individual audience member and reminds them who
they really are.  It is my great honor to
be one of Dan’s devices, a tool to help him hold up the mirror.  </p>
<p>I love <i>theMumblings.</i>  It is as special and dark and beautiful as
life tends to be.  Certainly JODIE and ALLEN
are unique individuals in an unconventional situation, but the more I work on
this play, the more I realize that they are everyone.  Perhaps that is why they portray so many
people from one another’s past.  Truly,
who among us is immune to fear?  Who is
so strong that they are able to side step it completely?  I’ve yet to meet that person, but I so wish I could
because I would convince them to tell me their secret.  I believe that we as humans are worthy of
everything life has to offer.  We each deserve
support, companionship, success and romantic love.  Allowing trauma, dread, worry and fear to box
us in is cheating ourselves and the people around us.  If I do my job right, both actors will travel
deep into the truth of each and every character they portray, and mine out
moments that will help every audience member access a feeling loneliness and fear
so they may see it clearly before releasing it.  Or maybe, if we don’t inspire that level of
self-reflection, perhaps we will just encourage a new level of acceptance for people
who are living life a little differently than we are, and remember that not
everything is as good or bad as it may seem from the outside. </p>
</div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>What it will cost to produce theMumblings </h3>
</div>
<p><i>Putting
up a play is hard work, but more than that, it costs a little bit to fully realize the work.  Below, you’ll find a general
breakdown of what we estimate it will cost to make theMumblings happen in Denver in fall of
2016 with a little breakdown of where that money actually goes. </i></p><p><i></i></p><p><i>With these estimated costs, our show will require approximately $18,220 to realize full production.  It is a large number, but it is not impossible to reach - not with the help of our community and supporters. Thank you for taking the time to look this over!</i></p><p><i>  -theMumblings Team</i></p>

<p><b><u>Renting our theatre for a 4-week run - $7367</u></b></p>
<p>We will be
performing our play at The Bakery Arts Warehouse in the heart of downtown Denver. This
is a small venue without many fancy frills but, artistically, it is perfect for
what we are doing.  The cost of rent is
based entirely upon our use of the space, and gives us exclusive rights to the
venue. </p>
<p>(In comparison, a
venue like this in New York would cost about $16,000 to rent for a 4-week run.)</p>
<p><b><u>Rehearsal space - $100</u></b></p>
<p>Something that
Denver has plenty of is space and, with our small cast, we are able to
make use of private residences and donated free space from different locations
around the city.  We did put aside a bit
of money just in case we are in desperate need of a legitimate rehearsal space.
Most companies in Colorado have their own theatre in which they may
rehearse.  This independent production
company does not yet have their “home” in Denver, so we may have to invest a
little in this area. </p>
<p><b><u>Marketing Fees - $1500</u></b></p>
<p>Since we are a new
company to the Denver theatrical scene, it is important that we get the word out
as best we can!  That means marketing. In addition to
printing posters and postcards and putting them up all over town, we must purchase ad space in publications
like The Westword, The Denver Post, and more. 
We have even budgeted for a Press Representative to help us with this
process so we can receive reviews from our colleagues in the industry.  We want this production to be well-attended
and well-received, and that means we must get the word out in every way we
can. </p>
<p><b><u>Concessions costs - $200</u></b></p>
<p>Not only do we want our audience
to have a great night at the theatre, we want to bring in a little extra money to pay for all of this fun stuff. 
We satisfy both objectives by providing beer, wine and snacks available for a suggested
donation.  The way we begin this process is by
buying candy, chips and soda in bulk at Costco or Sam's Club so we can get the lowest cost per unit.  If we are really lucky, we will be able get a beer
sponsor - and that is definitely on our search list as we move into our next
phase of production. (Would you like to be our beer sponsor? Do you know someone who would? Please let us know!)</p>
<p><b><u>Set design materials - $1000</u></b></p>
<p><i>theMumbings</i>
takes place in an apartment, and so we must transform The Bakery into said
apartment.  Set Designer, Anshuman
Bhatia, a graduate of DU and now resident of New York City, is thrilled to be
able to make use of a beg, borrow and steal sensibility to make our set design as
clean and impressive as possible.  We
will be spending money on furniture, paint, lumber and more. </p>
<p><b><u>Costume design materials - $400</u></b></p>
<p>While there are only
two  actors in our production, they play a great many characters.  When this convention is used in a play, it can
sometimes come off as being silly or campy.  That
sort of sensibility does not work for <i>theMumblings</i>.  Instead, we will use a basic outfit for each
actor on which to build clear, clean, character-motivated pieces for each new
persona.  Although this is not a period
piece set in, say, the French Revolution or Renaissance England, sometimes
contemporary pieces can be equally costly. </p>
<p><b><u>Sound and Lighting design materials - $200</u></b></p>
<p>Since The Bakery
offers limited lighting instruments, much of our play will be lit with
“practicals” or lights that are a part of the set, like lamps.  The items must mesh well with our set design
concept and do their job at the same time. 
We also have a top notch sound designer who may have to purchase rights to copyrighted sound files in order to create the world of the play with audible sound. </p>
<p><b><u>Transportation costs - $1400</u></b></p>
<p>Since this play
brings our Director in from New York, transportation costs may seem a bit
higher than most production budgets. 
Getting to and from the east coast for auditions and rehearsals can cost a
pretty penny.  We are lucky enough
to have a playwright who is allowing us to do his play for only the cost of a
plane ticket so that he may come see the show. In addition to airfare, the cost of gas and
transportation for moving the set in and out of the theatre before and after our run adds up. Where we will save on rehearsal space, we will likely spend on
transportation. </p>
<p><b><u>Designer Fees - $1550</u></b></p>
<p>Designers can make
or break a production.  Luckily for us, we
have an amazing team of talent to make our show visually and aurally effective
before the actors even open their mouths. 
The figure listed above is well under what professional designers usually get, but
each of these artists are investing their time and talents into <i>theMumblings</i> because they believe in the
work.  If it turns out we can pay them
more, we certainly will. While designers are not required to be at every
rehearsal, they do spend quite a bit of time drafting up design ideas and
gathering pieces to make their vision a reality.  The investment of time is why their fees are
smaller than that of the actors or directors who are required to be at
every rehearsal and performance.<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""> </span></p>

<p></p></div>","Wide Eyed loves Colorado!  Wide Eyed Productions was conceived in Colorado and born in New York. Since 2007, founders Liz White, Sky Seals & Kristin Skye Hoffmann (all alumni from the University of Northern Colorado) have been driving Wide Eyed to produce terrific independent theatre for the artistic community of New York City.  Producing prolifically from day one, the company is currently dedicated to the exclusive focus upon new works by emerging playwrights.  So committed are we to this cause that we decided to go back to our roots and bring some of our work to the Denver theatre community.  
This fall, we will proudly present the Colorado premiere of theMumblings by Dan Kitrosser, Wide Eyed's Resident Playwright.  This beautiful two-person production follows JODIE and ALLEN, a charming couple with a bit of an unconventional arrangement.  You see, JODIE is straight and ALLEN is gay. They are best friends and they are married.  Join them as they show you what events in their lives led to this most perfect union as they play out other characters from one another's past. This subtly dark and very funny tale first premiered at the New York International Fringe Festival (FringeNYC) to critical acclaim.  
Starring original Wide Eyed Productions company member and current Denver resident Lauren Bahlman, UNC alumnus Lanny Boyer, and directed by Wide Eyed's Artistic Director, Kristin Skye Hoffmann, this production is sure to be a special addition to the artistic landscape of the great city of Denver.

A Note from the Director about theMumblings 



Playwright Dan Kitrosser gets people.  I’ve known him for a while and, in that time,
I’ve been privileged enough to work on several of his plays. In each play, the
evidence is there: Dan understands what
humans are all about, and he puts that divine understanding in all his
work.  He is sneaky about it,
though.  He distracts you with humor or a
story or a theatrical device that makes you think you’re in for something
usual, something you’d expect to see at the theatre.  Then, with stealth and strategic methodology,
he holds a mirror up to each individual audience member and reminds them who
they really are.  It is my great honor to
be one of Dan’s devices, a tool to help him hold up the mirror.  
I love theMumblings.  It is as special and dark and beautiful as
life tends to be.  Certainly JODIE and ALLEN
are unique individuals in an unconventional situation, but the more I work on
this play, the more I realize that they are everyone.  Perhaps that is why they portray so many
people from one another’s past.  Truly,
who among us is immune to fear?  Who is
so strong that they are able to side step it completely?  I’ve yet to meet that person, but I so wish I could
because I would convince them to tell me their secret.  I believe that we as humans are worthy of
everything life has to offer.  We each deserve
support, companionship, success and romantic love.  Allowing trauma, dread, worry and fear to box
us in is cheating ourselves and the people around us.  If I do my job right, both actors will travel
deep into the truth of each and every character they portray, and mine out
moments that will help every audience member access a feeling loneliness and fear
so they may see it clearly before releasing it.  Or maybe, if we don’t inspire that level of
self-reflection, perhaps we will just encourage a new level of acceptance for people
who are living life a little differently than we are, and remember that not
everything is as good or bad as it may seem from the outside. 

    What it will cost to produce theMumblings 

Putting
up a play is hard work, but more than that, it costs a little bit to fully realize the work.  Below, you’ll find a general
breakdown of what we estimate it will cost to make theMumblings happen in Denver in fall of
2016 with a little breakdown of where that money actually goes. With these estimated costs, our show will require approximately $18,220 to realize full production.  It is a large number, but it is not impossible to reach - not with the help of our community and supporters. Thank you for taking the time to look this over!  -theMumblings Team
***
Renting our theatre for a 4-week run - $7367
We will be
performing our play at The Bakery Arts Warehouse in the heart of downtown Denver. This
is a small venue without many fancy frills but, artistically, it is perfect for
what we are doing.  The cost of rent is
based entirely upon our use of the space, and gives us exclusive rights to the
venue. 
(In comparison, a
venue like this in New York would cost about $16,000 to rent for a 4-week run.)
Rehearsal space - $100
Something that
Denver has plenty of is space and, with our small cast, we are able to
make use of private residences and donated free space from different locations
around the city.  We did put aside a bit
of money just in case we are in desperate need of a legitimate rehearsal space.
Most companies in Colorado have their own theatre in which they may
rehearse.  This independent production
company does not yet have their “home” in Denver, so we may have to invest a
little in this area. 
Marketing Fees - $1500
Since we are a new
company to the Denver theatrical scene, it is important that we get the word out
as best we can!  That means marketing. In addition to
printing posters and postcards and putting them up all over town, we must purchase ad space in publications
like The Westword, The Denver Post, and more. 
We have even budgeted for a Press Representative to help us with this
process so we can receive reviews from our colleagues in the industry.  We want this production to be well-attended
and well-received, and that means we must get the word out in every way we
can. 
Concessions costs - $200
Not only do we want our audience
to have a great night at the theatre, we want to bring in a little extra money to pay for all of this fun stuff. 
We satisfy both objectives by providing beer, wine and snacks available for a suggested
donation.  The way we begin this process is by
buying candy, chips and soda in bulk at Costco or Sam's Club so we can get the lowest cost per unit.  If we are really lucky, we will be able get a beer
sponsor - and that is definitely on our search list as we move into our next
phase of production. (Would you like to be our beer sponsor? Do you know someone who would? Please let us know!)

This was not an easy decision for us, and we are sure that you might have questions to ask. Please do not hesitate to contact us at: las5estaciones.circo@gmail.com. We will be looking forward to give you an appopriate response.

<p><strong>Hello beautiful people of the Internet.</strong></p>
<p>We are members of the Devised Theatre class of 2013 at York University.</p>
<p>It's very nice to meet you.</p>
</div>
<div>Over the past few years, our class has created pieces canvassing such topics as:  cannibalism, rave culture, Canadian serial killers, nuclear family dynamics, the surrealist movement, the Earths carrying capacity and general raging against the machine.</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Still with me?</strong></p>
<p>We are a brand new program, which means that the budget for Theatre@York has not yet been fully expanded to accomodate 4 more fully-fledged productions. We have access to studio space, which is a blessing, but the rest of... well, everything, comes from us.</p>
<p>So where will the money go you wonder? The answer, dear internet, is simple. It will go straight into making these shows as thrilling as humanly possible.<br/>That means:<br/>creating costumes <br/>building the set<br/>lighting the show<br/>LOUD NOISES (sound design)<br/>advertisements/ flyers/ posters (we love posters, posters are key... I'm gonna say posters one more time... POSTERS)<br/>and all of our many props!</p>
<p>As you can see, this is quite a feat. We could do it alone, but only if we all gave up food and shelter for the next few months so please, help us out.</p>
<p>If you can't donate at this time, please feel free to share the campaign via facebook, twitter, email, carrier pigeon, smoke signal, interpretive dance, or however your little heart desires. Everything helps.</p>
<p>THANK YOU SO MUCH FROM THE BOTTOM OF ALL OF OUR HEARTS (we have very deep hearts, so that is a lot of love coming your way)</p>

These funds will go towards the cost of the venue, hiring a publicist so the show can get the attention it deserves, and paying our dancers.</p>
<p>When you give to this campaign we are offering rewards, such as limited edition 10th anniversary posters signed by the dancers, tickets to the show in June, and of course, a receipt for a charitable donation as we are a registered non-profit company. </p>
<p>With your help, we can reach a larger audience than ever before.  Part of our mission statement is to share our love of dance with our audiences and you will be helping to do this in a very real way.  We believe that dance connects with people in a way few other art forms can, and with your help we can prove it. </p>

<h3><span>What is LA VOCE TO ME?</span></h3>
<p>LA VOCE TO ME is an original play about the interconnection of Hans Christian Andersen (author of the original story of The Little Mermaid), Howard Ashman (lyricist and composer for Disney's The Little Mermaid), and the local playwright Jeremy Pace. The experiences portrayed in the original fairy tale are echoed in the lives of these three men across time. Each of their own stories reflect the others in themes of love, sacrifice, death, and rebirth while also dealing with the gay experience, addiction, HIV and AIDS, and recovery.</p>
<h3>
<strong>What does LA VOCE TO ME mean?</strong> </h3>
<p>The phrase ""la voce to me"" is a lyric from the song ""Pour Unfortunate Souls"" in Disney's The Little Mermaid. Literally, it means ""the voice to me"" and represents the moment that Ariel's voice was taken in sacrifice by Ursula the Sea Witch. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Impact of your Support</h3>
<p>Participation in the Capital Fringe Festival 2013 is a priceless experience, but it still has its costs. This IndieGoGo campaign will allow us to pay for registration and insurance fees required by the festival as well as costumes, set, and modest compensation for our actors and crew. </p>
<p>In return, you will be rewarded based on the level of your support. From written recognition of your name or a name in memoriam in our program, to an invitation to share your own story in our LA VOCE TO YOU project, to a handmade piece of art or jewelry, to a Q&amp;A coffee session with the writer, and even a bound copy of the original script. Check the right hand side of this page for a list of potential rewards for your contribution. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Boosting the Signal</h3>
<p>While financial support ultimately pays the bills, this is a play about sharing our stories and regaining our voices! If the idea of this play touches you, please boost the signal and share it with others. </p>
<h3>Showtimes &amp; Location</h3>
<p>Thursday, July 11th — 5:30-6:45pm<br/>Sunday, July 14th — 5:15-6:30pm<br/>Saturday, July 20th — 5:15-6:30pm<br/>Wednesday, July 24th — 6:30-7:45pm<br/>Saturday, July 27th — 3:45-5:00pm </p>

The phrase ""la voce to me"" is a lyric from the song ""Pour Unfortunate Souls"" in Disney's The Little Mermaid. Literally, it means ""the voice to me"" and represents the moment that Ariel's voice was taken in sacrifice by Ursula the Sea Witch. 


Impact of your Support
Participation in the Capital Fringe Festival 2013 is a priceless experience, but it still has its costs. This IndieGoGo campaign will allow us to pay for registration and insurance fees required by the festival as well as costumes, set, and modest compensation for our actors and crew. 
In return, you will be rewarded based on the level of your support. From written recognition of your name or a name in memoriam in our program, to an invitation to share your own story in our LA VOCE TO YOU project, to a handmade piece of art or jewelry, to a Q&A coffee session with the writer, and even a bound copy of the original script. Check the right hand side of this page for a list of potential rewards for your contribution. 


Boosting the Signal
While financial support ultimately pays the bills, this is a play about sharing our stories and regaining our voices! If the idea of this play touches you, please boost the signal and share it with others.

<p>Ladies, lovers, and gentlefolks,<br/><br/> Your friend and humble narrator comes before you today to beseech your aid. As some of you may know, in its 3rd year, the Steampunk Industrial Revolution has come to an end. This was a convention that many members of Karnevil were present for its mythic birthing, and are quite sad to see it go..</p>
<p>BUT like a mighty phoenix, another New England Steampunk convention, the Air City Expedition, has risen to take its place, and we at the Karnevil Krewe want nothing more than to be there to help it be a rousing and arousing success! Sadly, though the folks at Air City have been more than accommodating, they have reached the limit of what they can provide us with, we will still need the help of you, our loving fans and members of the steam community, to help us get there. As poor travelling performers, in a gas hog of an '87 dodge van, we need some start up capital to get us from Southern New Jersey to New Hampshire.</p>
<p>We are asking for the minimum amount of money this site will allow, we do not necessarily need to meet the goal, but every penny contributed will help us immensely with gas, tolls, food, and any other travel expenses that may occur. We beg that you graciously open your hearts and your wallets to give us a hand and help us make the first year of this amazing new event everything that it can be. We promise to work our hardest to make every single patron of Air City have the most splendid weekend in the history of future past. So please, if you be a fan of ours, vaudeville, steampunk, the arts, or New England, we hope that you can find it in you to spare a few dollars and help us help others make dreams come true.</p>
<p>Thank you,<br/>Arson of Karnevil</p>

<p>I currently enjoy working as Program Director for the Milagro Center, a non-profit arts-enrichment afterschool and outreach center for at-risk youth in Delray Beach, FL.</p>
<p><em><strong>Florida Flow Fest 2012</strong></em> is my most ambitious undertaking, and a true labor of love. The fest offers hour-long workshops in each of the following object manipulation, circus art and movement disciplines: <em>poi spinning, hoop dancing/hooping, staff spinning, juggling, belly dance, African dance, Tai Chi, Capoeira, and yoga</em>.  Additionally, this year a number of freshly emerging prop practices will be taught, such as: <em>puppyhammer, rope dart and acro yoga combined with slackline balancing, a practice known as ‘slackro’.</em> </p>
<p>This year, the festival is in its second year, and has drawn upon tremendous support as a result of the joy generated by last year’s inaugural event.  The fire spinning, yoga and dance community state-wide relish this opportunity to learn and share together, and to broadcast the benefits of participating in the FLOW ARTS.  Many participants have been waiting ALL YEAR to rejoin this incredible community, a small slice of tropical bliss on the first weekend of Flow-vember!</p>
<p><strong>We adore our sponsors: SpinBalls, Groovolution Dance Studio, Elemental Expressions Entertainment, The Kwak, Gratitude Training, Expand the Love, Master Ong's Prop Shop, Alternative Movement, Jai Healing Arts, All En Academy of Dance, Capoeira Karkara and Wisdom Method School of Yoga</strong>!!!</p>

<p><strong>We need cash!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Because FloridaFlowFest is a PUBLIC festival, we are in need of financial support from the community to have it be OPEN to the general public.</strong></p>

<p>WHAT ARE FLOW ARTS?</p>
<p>Flow arts are forms of movement and dance that utilize props to enter a state of flow, described by psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi as an exhilarating transcendent way of being in which effortless control and peak skill seem to erase a sense of time. Flow arts props include poi, staff and hoops; dancers manipulate props to add to the expressive qualities of their dance. The result is an awe-inspiring visual spectacle of improvised movement that inspires an audience to reconsider kinetic possibilities.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our eventual goal for the Florida Flow Fest is convert it into a major fundraiser and programming element of a South Florida based FLOW ARTS non-profit that delivers cutting-edge curriculum in the flow arts to K-12 classrooms statewide, inviting young people to achieve higher levels of critical thinking, coordination and balance, while allowing them to explore the physical world through the lens of play and discovery.  Accessing the flow state of consciousness is a key element in developing a harmonious connection with all of life, and in expressing one’s purpose in life.</p>

<p>My name is Samantha Duff and I'm a graduate of Mount Royal College's theatre diploma program and I have a bachleor of fine arts in acting from the University of Alberta. I recently started my own theatre company, Goodger-Pink Productions, and our debut production is an outdoor, all ages, ""re-mix"" version of<em> Rumpelstiltskin</em>, to be performed at Kinsmen Park in Okotoks.</p>
<p>This debut project is especially important to me because I grew up in Okotoks, a small town just south of Calgary and when I was 7 years old an improv troupe came to town and performed outdoors in the park by the library.  It was one of my first experiences with live theatre and I remember feeling so inspired by what these ""cool kids"" were doing. My mum took me to almost every show they put on that summer. They performed on a ""Pay What You Can"" donation basis, which made it financially accessible to everyone in town. It was an opportunity to share quality time with my family, out of the house, and to be exposed to something really unique in an otherwise small prairie town. Outdoor donation-based all-ages theatre builds community, creates opportunities for families to connect and is a fun way to spend a summer evening.</p>
<p>And that's where my project comes in...</p>
<p>A lot has happened since that improv troupe came to town. I've grown as an actor and a person. I moved away to Edmonton for school, started my professional acting career and traveled a great deal of the world. Okotoks has grown considerably too. New businesses have opened, the population continues to rise and it's become a bustling, vibrant place. Despite its growth one thing that hasn't changed is how much the people of Okotoks and the surrounding areas value community, family, and a welcoming small town feeling.  Since moving back I'm excited to re-connect with my hometown by offering the community something I'm passionate about, theatre.</p>
<p>My cast, including myself and fellow U of A acting graduates Holleay Rohm and Matthew McKinney, have a great deal of experience performing for children on a professional level, including Shakespeare school touring shows and residences in schools all over the province. To the best of my knowledge, nothing quite like this has been offered to the children and families of the Okotoks area since that improv troupe came to town more than 20 years ago. With your help I'm hoping to change that!</p>
<p>I am embarking on this project with no government grant money and with the intention to make theatre financially accessible for everyone by selling tickets on a ""Pay What You Can"" donation basis. Because of this I am relying soley on the generosity of others.</p>
<p>I have settled on a fundrasing goal of $700, the breakdown as follows...</p>
<p>$180- script and payment of royalties for script</p>
<p>$260- price of rental for Kinsmen Park for the four performances</p>
<p>$260- advertising costs: posters, handbills, space in local newspapers, ect.</p>
<p>We plan to be creative and thrifty with our set and costumes to keep the costs down, but if we are able to raise more money, it would go towards production costs like that.</p>
<p>Anyone who donates (any amount of money at all, we can use all the help we can get) will have their name posted on our show board at every performance, with a huge THANK YOU next to it. If donating money is not a possibility, we will thank you just as much if you support us by either coming out to see our show, or spreading the word to friends and families you think might be interested!</p>
<p>Show details...</p>

</div></div>","My name is Samantha Duff and I'm a graduate of Mount Royal College's theatre diploma program and I have a bachleor of fine arts in acting from the University of Alberta. I recently started my own theatre company, Goodger-Pink Productions, and our debut production is an outdoor, all ages, ""re-mix"" version of Rumpelstiltskin, to be performed at Kinsmen Park in Okotoks.
This debut project is especially important to me because I grew up in Okotoks, a small town just south of Calgary and when I was 7 years old an improv troupe came to town and performed outdoors in the park by the library.  It was one of my first experiences with live theatre and I remember feeling so inspired by what these ""cool kids"" were doing. My mum took me to almost every show they put on that summer. They performed on a ""Pay What You Can"" donation basis, which made it financially accessible to everyone in town. It was an opportunity to share quality time with my family, out of the house, and to be exposed to something really unique in an otherwise small prairie town. Outdoor donation-based all-ages theatre builds community, creates opportunities for families to connect and is a fun way to spend a summer evening.
And that's where my project comes in...
A lot has happened since that improv troupe came to town. I've grown as an actor and a person. I moved away to Edmonton for school, started my professional acting career and traveled a great deal of the world. Okotoks has grown considerably too. New businesses have opened, the population continues to rise and it's become a bustling, vibrant place. Despite its growth one thing that hasn't changed is how much the people of Okotoks and the surrounding areas value community, family, and a welcoming small town feeling.  Since moving back I'm excited to re-connect with my hometown by offering the community something I'm passionate about, theatre.
My cast, including myself and fellow U of A acting graduates Holleay Rohm and Matthew McKinney, have a great deal of experience performing for children on a professional level, including Shakespeare school touring shows and residences in schools all over the province. To the best of my knowledge, nothing quite like this has been offered to the children and families of the Okotoks area since that improv troupe came to town more than 20 years ago. With your help I'm hoping to change that!
I am embarking on this project with no government grant money and with the intention to make theatre financially accessible for everyone by selling tickets on a ""Pay What You Can"" donation basis. Because of this I am relying soley on the generosity of others.
I have settled on a fundrasing goal of $700, the breakdown as follows...
$180- script and payment of royalties for script
$260- price of rental for Kinsmen Park for the four performances
$260- advertising costs: posters, handbills, space in local newspapers, ect.
We plan to be creative and thrifty with our set and costumes to keep the costs down, but if we are able to raise more money, it would go towards production costs like that.
Anyone who donates (any amount of money at all, we can use all the help we can get) will have their name posted on our show board at every performance, with a huge THANK YOU next to it. If donating money is not a possibility, we will thank you just as much if you support us by either coming out to see our show, or spreading the word to friends and families you think might be interested!

<h2>Our History</h2>
<p>Nicole Schalmo and Christina Sheehan met while performing together at The American Theatre of Actors.  In June of 2011 they had a crazy idea to mount their own minimalist production of A Midsummer Night's Dream.  Thus began an ambitious new company as well as a beautiful new friendship!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""spotlight lazy"" data-src=""http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-snc6/224937_762217503216_1375687150_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 520px; height: 347px;""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>In our first year we have put up four successful productions, following A Midsummer Night's Dream with Romeo and Juliet, The Comedy of Errors, and Othello. Along the way we have built a company of talented, committed actors who repeatedly come back to us; while we continue to grow and always bring in new blood.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""spotlight lazy"" data-src=""http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/36554_312100418862934_1195114734_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 520px; height: 330px;""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What We Do</h2>
<p>What Dreams May Co. is dedicated to making the classics accessible to all.  Simple, minimalistic productions leave the focus on the language and characters, challenging the actors in the company to reach new levels and expand their knowledge of the classics. Passionate performances delve to the heart of the text, bringing the story to life in a way that connects with and immerses modern audiences.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""spotlight lazy"" data-src=""http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-snc7/315828_180788391994138_3327122_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 520px; height: 418px;""/></p>
</div>
<p> </p>
<p>We strive, above all, to bring the text to life; capturing the energy and excitement the plays had when they were first performed.  These plays were the popular entertainment of the day!  When a production is really true to Shakespeare's text, you begin to see that the plays are really full of outragous humor and bawdy sexuality. Ultimately, we make Shakespeare accessible, because we remember that it was always intended for the masses.  This author knew how to shock and excite his audience, and four hundred years later there are still surprises to be found.  There is never an excuse for making these plays stuffy or boring.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""spotlight lazy"" data-src=""http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/524650_312089355530707_1376935355_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 331px; height: 520px;""/></p>
<p>Our productions always have a modern sensibility, leaving the text untouched but presenting the action as if it was happening in today's world. We bring an immediacy and relatability to texts that could otherwise appear old and stale. We often employ gender swapping in our productions, giving actresses the chance to explore traditionally male roles and bringing a whole new take to both the individual role and the production as a whole.</p>

<p> </p>
<h2>What We're Up To Now</h2>
<p>As we enter our second year of bringing Shakespeare to the people, we are tackling the big one, our namesake, Hamlet!</p>

<h3> </h3>
<p>We want this production to be bigger and better than ever!  We are looking to give this production a longer run, giving our audiences more chances to come and see it!  We are also planning to grow our marketing program, so everyone knows where to find us!  Help us get people into those seats!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The Somerville High School Drama Club are a group of 18-30 teenagers who, against all odds this year, managed to participate in the state play festival in March. With zero resources from their school, we're turning to our community to ask that you help us cover the expenses we incurred to attend Fest, and also help us make it on a field trip to see a professional play this spring!</p>
<ul>
<li>We only need to raise about $500.</li>
<li>This covers the cost of props and sets, the busses we've rented and need to rent to get to shows, and the tickets for our field trip. Please help in any way you can!</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Many kids who struggle academically, socially, or emotionally are drawn to theater as a place where they can be themselves and learn how to work collaboratively on a long term project. The ""drama program"" at SHS is really the personal efforts of English teacher Curtis Eames, and the little attention and resources we are allowed officially are on the chopping block.</p>
<p>If we can show the school that our community wants us to exist, it will set a precident for the rest of the school year and into the future. The club particpants were thrilled to make it to the state festival this year, and hope to come back in 2014 as even stronger competitors.</p>

<p>Liars &amp; Believers is collaborating with a dozen of our favorite performers to bring a new, unpublished short story by author Neil Gaiman to the stage on February 13, 2013 at Oberon in Harvard Square. Each collaborator is taking a part of the story and bringing it to life using music, dance, aerial performance, puppetry, poetry, storytelling, and more.</p>
<p>Neil’s short story is just shy of 3000 words, and we’re blowing it up into a feast for the senses. Director Steven Bogart is guiding the performers in unpacking meanings and themes – memory, identity, healing – and will put together all the pieces during our four day rehearsal period.</p>
<p>This talented group of artists includes Mali Sastri, Phillip Berman, Mary Bichner, Brett Cramp, Claire Davies, Jennifer Hicks, John J. King, Eileen Little, Corianna Moffatt, Masha Obolensky, April Ranger, and Karin Webb.

<p><strong>Boston Actors Theater</strong> has been producing since 2004 and is comprised of a group of Bostonian artists who come together to produce mostly new works by local playwrights. Our mission is to support the community; meaning producing local, hiring local designers, directors, and actors; as well as raising funds for a local charity during the run of our productions. We often take on challenging works for the audience and our artists. This production is one of those special works that needs the communities help to put up. Due to the technical demands and intense themes of this production BAT needs your help! With your donations we can reach this wonderful script’s potential!</p>
<p><strong>What is Paper City Phoenix about?</strong></p>
<p>Brenna’s soul mate is missing, but finding him is hard when she can’t stop mentally channeling Google searches. Gale tries to help her, but she’s got her own problems and her printer’s out of toner. Both women, an anti-tech cult, the FBI, and the Internet itself will be involved before it’s over, and the city will never be the same. <strong>PAPER CITY PHOENIX</strong> is an explosive comedy that looks at how we connect when we’re always connected, and what’s left when the universe hits the delete key.</p>
<p>“This is a big, crazy comedy,” says playwright McGough, “with big production demands and a comic-book aesthetic. But at its core is a character-driven story about the need for connection. I’m extremely lucky to work with such talented artists, bringing it all to life.”</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>We are hoping to raise $2000 to put towards our $3000 budget for this production. This will cover stipends for all the artists working on this project, as well as the costumes, sound, sets, and a complicated paint design elements. We will not only be creating a world of paper, but one inside of technology and a burnt out post-apocalyptic city, not to mention a very electrifying opening!</p>
<p>You can see some of the costume sketches in the gallery section! All the costume sketches are by our costumer <span>Cara Chiaramonte, see more of her work at </span><a href=""http://carachiaramonte.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">http://carachiaramonte.com</a></p>
<p>Every amount helps no matter how big or small to help us achieve our goal of creating a high quality production for everyone to experience!  In exchange we have some great things to offer you, from our gratitude, to tickets, to signed scripts, pieces written by Walt just for you, and coaching from Director Melanie! Everyone will be thanked on facebook no matter how large or small the donation. Even if it's $1! Check out everything and please give to this amazing project!</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>If you can’t help at this time please we understand. Still want to help? Spread the word to those who may be able to help out. Every little bit helps when approaching a work as big as this and every piece of help is truly appreciated!</p></div>","Who we are:

<h3>The Show</h3>
<p>'Catch the Wall' is a new play that playwright Gabrielle Reisman and The NOLA Project have been passionately developing for three years.  This is a vibrant, fun, and passionate New Orleans story that doesn't deal in easy cliches, but tells the story of New Orleans today, in our post-recovery, back-to-life world.  The play will open at Dillard University's Cook Theatre on March 14 and run for two weeks.  Our hope is not only to tell our immediate community this amazing story, but to bring a well-deserved national spotlight on the first-rate theatre that has been growing in New Orleans since 2005.</p>
<p>This production will employ a team of twenty-two talented artists:</p>
<ul>
<li>9 New Orleans actors</li>
<li>5 innovative designers (sound, video, scenic, lighting, costumes)</li>
<li>2 stage managers (the hardest-working folks you might never see!)</li>
<li>4 production specialists (the amazing folks that handle all the administrative needs)</li>
<li>1 visionary director</li>
<li>1 incredible playwright that made this whole thing possible</li>
</ul>
<p>And that doesn't even include the dozens of people that have already lent their hands and souls as precious volunteers!</p>
<p>Needless to say, this is our largest production of a new play ever, and we need and want you, our supporters to have a monumental hand in seeing it come to life!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In additional to paying all of our working artists we need to pay for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Theatre Rental.  Dillard's Cook Theater is a beautiful theater, but it ain't free!</li>
<li>Building Materials: lumber, nails, paint, caulk, scenic furniture...</li>
<li>Lights and gels (the things that make the lights cast pretty colors)</li>
<li>Projection technology.  We are using a new form of projection called 3-D mapping.  It's pretty awesome, and we can't wait to show it off!</li>
<li>Advertising like posters, postcards, ads, and emails so folks know about us</li>
<li>Sound equipment and music.  This is a Bounce play after all!</li>
<li>Costume materials.  We're building Mardi Gras indian suits y'all.</li>
<li>Insurance.  You know, in case a light falls on our head.</li>
</ul>
<p>And for helping us meet these needs, please select from our great variety of donation perks!  Also remember that The NOLA Project is a 501c3 non-profit organization and your philanthropy is tax-deductible.</p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Your contribution promotes not only the health of this production, but is a major impact to the cultural economy of New Orelans. New Orleans is a city defined by our culture, much of which can be contributed to our incredible artists.</p>
<p>Every year, The NOLA Project provides paying work for over 100 artists.  We believe that the artistic contributions of all our theatremakers is worthy of remuneration, and we continue to try and increase pay in order to promote professional working conditions for all the extremely hard-working and deserving artists.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Angel Tucker and as an Expert Personality Profiler I have helped 10's of thousands of people realize the benefits of understanding different personality types. My best-selling book titled: Stop Squatting With Your Spurs On teaches people how to read personality types in less than 60 seconds. I am also the creator of the Award Winning children' book series titled: Four Pals. This project is based off the characters in these books. The purpose of this project is to perform a live show in the San Antonio, TX area for the children of our military families serving at three local military bases to include Randolph Air Force Base, Lackland Air Force Base. and Ft Sam Houston. We want to teach the children the importance of eating healthy and staying fit. These children, many of whom deal with challenges on a daily basis to include deployed parents, wounded parents, and sometimes parents who sadly never return from deployment rarely think about the importance of health and fitness. We want to show them how to make sure they take care of themselves physically. When children feel better physically, they are better equipped to deal with emotional things. We want to give them the tools they need to feel good about themselves, encourage others to feel good about themselves, and have a healthy mental outlook on life as well. By supporting this project, you are saying ""thank you"" to all the children who have sacrificed for our Country. This show will be free to all who attend. The seating capacity for the theatre is nearly 1000 and we want to perform for a packed theatre of well deserving children, many of whom their parents can't afford much in the way of extra entertainment. This project will have a positive impact on the lives and morale of thousands of people directly, and countless people indirectly who are giving every day to protect our freedoms.</p>
<h3><strong>What We Need and What You Get</strong></h3>
</div>
<p>All the funds raised for this project will be used towards the printing costs of flyers, posters and tickets as well as hiring actors, audio/visual staff, and providing props as well as tshirts for the volunteer staff on site and also for the kids chosen to participate in the show. The amount we are requesting is the minimum we need, but every bit - even the amount above the requested funds will be used towards the show. The more we raise, the more we can promote the show to get the word out and also provide tshirts for children attending.</p>
<p>Here is a breakdown of what you receive in exchange for your support. Support of ANY amount is greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>$10.00+  mp3 of Angel's Couples Communication seminar</p>
<p>$25.00+ Autographed copy of Angel's best-selling book: Stop Squatting With Your Spurs On!</p>
<p>$50.00+ Autographed copy for you AND an Active Duty Member who is deployed! We will not only send you an autographed copy, we'll send one to someone serving our country and put a note that the book was paid for by you!</p>
<p>$75.00 Augraphed set of Angel's Four Pals children's book series.</p>
<p>$200.00+ 20 minute coaching/consulting session with Angel Tucker OR all the items listed for lesser donation amounts.</p>
<p>$400.00+ Your business listed as a sponsor for the event on all flyers, posters and show website.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I wish I could measure the impact that such a project has. The benefits are limitless. The military family benefits from being able to attend a free event that emphasizes habits that can increase their quality of life, the people in the lives of the military benefit from having someone with a positive outlook on life, and the people who donate benefit from knowing they have helped in immesurable ways to improve the lives of many.</p>

<p>The premiere reading of the Indigo Theatre Project took place in January 2013 with <em>Intimate Apparel </em>by Pulitzer Prize winning playwright, Lynn Nottage at the Pershing Square Signature Center in New York City.

With a star-studded dream cast (Quincy Tyler Bernstine, Joshua Henry, Ari Graynor, Tonya Pinkins, Condola Rashad, and Morgan Spector, with Dominique Morisseau reading stage directions), an up-and-coming director (Jade King Carroll), and accessible ticket prices, we sold out the 199-seat theater and made over $5,000 (read more about <em>Intimate Apparel</em> <a href=""http://www.playbill.com/news/article/173065-Intimate-Apparel-Benefit-Reading-Will-Feature-Quincy-Tyler-Bernstine-Ari-Graynor-Joshua-Henry-Tonya-Pinkins"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>). Being a relatively small organization, DDA's staff was overwhelmed by the support and publicity they received. Lynn, who was present to introduce the reading, expressed her gratitude for the reading by saying, “Your generosity of spirit is a gift. Please continue to do the work that you're doing, it is necessary and greatly appreciated.” Through the development of the Indigo Theatre Project, that is exactly what we intend to do.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We at Théâtre Sans Fond are convinced that we have created an original and innovative form of theatre, a result of 5 years of hard work during which many shows have been developped, each one presenting a new aesthetic to fit with the subject of the performance. ""Zeppelin Was a Cover Band"" having become a cult hit in Montreal, we are aiming to better that show with this new performance. We have evolved as artists and are getting better at what we do, so we are hoping to reach a larger audience than before. But, as is the case with the arts in general, funding is often lacking, and consequently, so many quality shows have been stuck in the underground, with limited visibility, because the artists are unable to rent a well known, well attended venue, or can't afford to pay for adequate promotional material that would give them extra visibility.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are confident in our work and in our capacity to deliver the goods, but we are also aware that we need better publicity to get the word out, to get people in the seats, to get the media interested, and, ultimately, get the positive response we've worked so hard for, in order to eventually reach a larger market by performing in larger venues or by touring.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mainline Theatre has proven over the years to be one such launchpad, as many artists who have performed there have gotten enough audience and media attention to move on to larger Montreal venues, eventually making a name for themselves in other cities, provinces, and countries.</p>

Théâtre Sans Fond
Théâtre Sans Fond produces theatrical performances inspired by rock music history. The first performance of the series, “Zeppelin c’t’un cover band”, was first produced in French in November 2006 at Mainline Theatre (Montreal), and remounted for the 2007 Montreal Fringe Festival.

The company’s most recent production, ""Autobiomusicograph(y)ie"", was nominated for the Cirque du Soleil « Best Original Production » award at the 2010 edition of the Montreal Fringe. In 2011, ""Autobiomusicograph(y)ie"" has been adapted into a series of shows that are performed regularly in various Montreal resto-bars. 
 
All I Want is U2
After telling the story of the blues through the music of rock group Led Zeppelin, the creator of ""Zeppelin Was a Cover Band"" presents a new theatrical chapter of rock history, taking over where Jimmy Page’s mythical rock band began to disintegrate. In 1976, in the midst of the punk revolution, four high school boys from Dublin started a band. In 1987, a thirteen year old teenager discovered the music of U2. Mixing lecture, storytelling and theatrical performance, featuring a live DJ, and directed by Stéphanie Pelletier (""Ombilic"", ""Terre confite""), ""All I Want is U2"" is the story of Irish rock band U2 as seen and heard through the eyes and ears of writer/performer Stéfan Cédilot.        
 
The embryo of « All I Want is U2 » was first produced at Université du Québec à Montréal (UQÀM) in May 2009, as part of Stéfan Cédilot’s thesis in theatre. Firmly planted in a university context, the performance that came out of it was a testimony to the intellectual process of a masters’ thesis, and exposed the results of the author’s analysis of the conceptual evolution of U2’s concerts. 
 
From this chronological analysis of a rock group’s live use of iconic imagery, which left little room for the writer’s own biography, « All I Want is U2 » has become an intimate performance in which the visual explosion of the U2 concert contrasts with personal anecdotes from Stéfan Cédilot’s own biography. A new performance for a new stage and a new audience. 
 
""All I Want is U2"" is scheduled to perform at Mainline Theatre, from September 28th to October 1st 2011.  
 


The Impact
We at Théâtre Sans Fond are convinced that we have created an original and innovative form of theatre, a result of 5 years of hard work during which many shows have been developped, each one presenting a new aesthetic to fit with the subject of the performance.

Mainline Theatre has proven over the years to be one such launchpad, as many artists who have performed there have gotten enough audience and media attention to move on to larger Montreal venues, eventually making a name for themselves in other cities, provinces, and countries.



What We Need & What You Get
Mainline Theatre has offered to co-produce the show, cutting the $2000 rental fee for five performances in half. We still need to pay $1000 in order to perform at Mainline, and this is where your financial contribution comes in!
 
We are already working hard to get money from various corporate and cultural sponsors, which has so far allowed us to rent a space where we have been rehearsing full-time since June. As we now enter the second phase of production, the money we have can either be used to pay for the Mainline rental, or pay for better publicity and a higher quality set design, but we cannot afford both!
 
Our objective is to raise as much money as we can on Indiegogo so as to divert as little as possible of our current budget to the venue rental fee. The more money you give, the more we can spend on the show's design and promotional material.
 
One of the coolest scenes of ""All I Want is U2"" is when Stéfan Cédilot describes U2's 1997 Pop Mart Tour, using what has come to be called the ""U2 POP MART '97 ACTION FIGURE SET"", which consists of a scale model of the Pop Mart tour's stage (6' wide x 3 1/2' high with the arch) and hand-made U2 action figures, created by our awesome designers, Jean-François Morel and Anne-Marie Taillefer.
 
Depending on your level of contribution to this production, we will send you a signed poster, tickets to the show at Mainline Theatre from September 28th to October 1st 2011, one of our hand-made U2 action figures, or a package including all 4 action figures with their instruments: the Bono action figure comes with a mic stand, The Edge and Adam come with a miniature guitar or bass, and Larry comes with a mini drum kit. (The action figures are actually modified '""80's G.I. Joe"" type action figures and are very cool!)
 
To anyone crazy enough to give us the full $1000 we need to perform at Mainline, we are crazy enough to send you THE WHOLE ""POP MART '97 ACTION FIGURE SET"", with the stage, the action figures, and a mirror ball lemon!!! (The mirror ball lemon is made out of a Nerf football! Very very cool!!) 
 
What can you do with a 6' x 3 1/2' U2 stage? When it is not being used in an ""All I Want is U2"" performance, Stéfan has already turned his into a bookshelf!!
 
Other Ways You Can Help
 


Please share this page with friends and anybody you know who might be interested in encouraging and financing innovative, cutting edge theatre! Also, if you know any hardcore U2 fans, tell them about the hand-made ""Pop Mart '97 Action Figure Set"". You can't get those on ebay!",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Flower to Flower was immaculately conceived in Stan Denman's playwriting
 class at Baylor University in 2006 as a young woman's rant against the 
status quo. Several years and an MFA later, it was reopened 
with the Brimmer Street Theater Company in Los Angeles, and the idea

still a whole lot to figure out. </p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p> We are 2 dancers/performance-artists from Denmark, who have been working together for several years. Through this project, we want to address both the question of originality within art (what is original, is originality needed to create artistic quality and is anything truly original) as well as the need for spreading the open-source mentality into the arts; in our case, the performing arts.</p>
<p> Through all of 2012, we keep an online video-notebook, where we upload 1 idea per person and day. These ideas are rough sketches for characters, choreographies, situations and other performance-related things. In addition to the vide-notebook, we also upload at least one short text per day, with a minimum length of one sentence.</p>
<p> All of the material we upload is open-source, which means that anyone can use it, copy it, re-make or re-work it and be inspired by it for their own work. We demand nothing in return, other than that we be mentioned as inspiration and are told if you use the material.</p>
<p> We also welcome comments, either written or in the form of video-comments. All comments will also become a part of the project, and will be free for us and others to use.</p>
<p> In the beginning of 2013, we will collect all of the material and create a performance using it. This performance will open in Copenhagen, Denmark, but we also hope to take it to other countries if it is a success here. The process of creating the performance will also be documented and will be uploaded as an open-source video for others to use or be inspired by.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p> We hope that this will open more artist to the idea of sharing their work and methods with others so that the performing arts can progress more and keep developing. We want our performance to be everybody's performance, with the chance of all the material we use, to have already been used by others.</p>
<p> We will finish the project no matter the amount of money we manage to raise. But of course, the finished performance will only be able to go as far as the funds allow.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> We are asking for USD 10.000,-. In addition to this, we are funding through a Danish web-site, and are applying for funding through the Danish Arts Council as well as some private donors.</p>
<p> The entire project has a budget of USD 38.000,- which are to cover the following expenses during the production period in the beginning of 2013:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Renting a rehearsal space</p>
<p>Wages for 2 performers (during rehearsals)</p>
<p>Wages for a stage technician</p>
<p>Renting a stage</p>
<p>Paying for costumes</p>
<p>Paying for set-design</p>
<p>Paying for the building of sets, including materials</p>
<p>Transport of materials to/from workshops and stage</p>
<p>PR, including web-design, adds in newspapers and online, posters and flyers</p>
<p> </p>
<p> We will create the best possible performance, using the funds we raise, and anyone supporting us, who is in Copenhagen when we open will receive free opening-night tickets.</p>
<p> In the event that the performance is a success and we go abroad with it, any funders, regardless of the amount of money they have contributed with, will receive free tickets if we are in their home-country or a country where they happen to be at the time.</p>
<p> Anyone who contributes, will get his/her name on the poster, even if this means that the poster has to be enormous:-). And if you don't want us to mention you, just say so and we won't.</p>
<p> We will, as stated above, create a performance, no matter how much money we raise. But, the finished performance will be easier to create, and have more production time, the closer we get to our total budget.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

We need your help. Our main mission is to provide professional theater experiences for teens who don't have access to theater, music, or the arts. We work in a unique manner in which we provide thorough education and training in a variety of theater and performance skills. We do this through a multidisciplinary educational process that includes workshops that focus on teaching skills, group dynamic activities, vocal and acting training, and multiple performances to give our cast a realistic experience of theater. Our casting process targets LGBT teens, students of various socioeconomic backgrounds, and diversity in culture.<br/></p><p>Project Arts chooses alternative musicals that deal with social justice issues and address those issues throughout our production. This gives our cast a unique understanding of their characters and the context of the show. Avenue Q, in fact, is a version of Sesame Street that delves into topics more relevant to adults. <br/></p><p>We have completed three musicals in our seven years of existence. We are currently producing ""Avenue Q School Edition"" at The Rotunda. The experiences of the kids who were in our last production, ""Rent School Edition"" were life-changing. The experience changed my life profoundly as well: I witnessed the teens hard at work, spending hours learning and rehearsing and, as a result, performing at a professional level. <br/></p><p>Inspired by Rent's success, I completed graduate school at Drexel University with a Master's of Education and a certificate in Special Education so that I could run Project Arts as a teaching professional and offer additional opportunities for youth. I also worked for Spiral Q Puppet Theater and performed independently as a puppeteer. Hence, upon graduation, I decided to begin a third production.<br/></p><p> We need enormous support for this endeavor. Massive budget cuts to schools in the Philadelphia region eliminated arts programs. Even the High School for Creative and Performing Arts (CAPA) almost canceled their yearly musical due to lack of funds. This is why our program is essential and we're seeking your financial support.<br/></p><p>Please give if you can. A contribution of even $5 would help us a great deal.<br/></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>How you can help us and what the money will be used for<br/>
</h3>Our minimum goal is to raise $5,000. If we exceed this amount, however, it will further support our endeavor. We have a budget of $21,000 dollars.

I am the executive director and founder of Project Arts. We need your help. Our main mission is to provide professional theater experiences for teens who don't have access to theater, music, or the arts. We work in a unique manner in which we provide thorough education and training in a variety of theater and performance skills. We do this through a multidisciplinary educational process that includes workshops that focus on teaching skills, group dynamic activities, vocal and acting training, and multiple performances to give our cast a realistic experience of theater. Our casting process targets LGBT teens, students of various socioeconomic backgrounds, and diversity in culture.Project Arts chooses alternative musicals that deal with social justice issues and address those issues throughout our production. This gives our cast a unique understanding of their characters and the context of the show. Avenue Q, in fact, is a version of Sesame Street that delves into topics more relevant to adults. We have completed three musicals in our seven years of existence. We are currently producing ""Avenue Q School Edition"" at The Rotunda. The experiences of the kids who were in our last production, ""Rent School Edition"" were life-changing. The experience changed my life profoundly as well: I witnessed the teens hard at work, spending hours learning and rehearsing and, as a result, performing at a professional level. Inspired by Rent's success, I completed graduate school at Drexel University with a Master's of Education and a certificate in Special Education so that I could run Project Arts as a teaching professional and offer additional opportunities for youth. I also worked for Spiral Q Puppet Theater and performed independently as a puppeteer. Hence, upon graduation, I decided to begin a third production. We need enormous support for this endeavor. Massive budget cuts to schools in the Philadelphia region eliminated arts programs. Even the High School for Creative and Performing Arts (CAPA) almost canceled their yearly musical due to lack of funds. This is why our program is essential and we're seeking your financial support.Please give if you can. A contribution of even $5 would help us a great deal.How you can help us and what the money will be used for
Our minimum goal is to raise $5,000. If we exceed this amount, however, it will further support our endeavor. We have a budget of $21,000 dollars. This may sound like a lot of money, but for a show of this magnitude it covers only the basics. We have costs for a full set, puppet rentals, rights for the performance, and hiring professional teachers for our workshops. (Here is a link to our wonderful staff: http://projectarts.info/aboutstaff.html).We believe in paying our employees a fair wage, because mostly people in theater work for free or very little money.

<p><i>The Bacchae</i> is one of the great Greek tragedies. A central figure is the young Greek God Dionysus,known by the Romans as Bacchus, the wine god. His parties were so wild the term bacchanalia was coined to describe them, and <i>The Bacchae</i> includes gods with mommy issues, wild Maenads, drunken revelry, lust, jealousy, revenge, cannibalism, cross-dressing, sex, drugs, rock and roll, and blood.</p>
<p><b>When the script calls for blood, we always feel more is better</b>.</p>
<h3><b>Our goal: $5,000</b></h3>
<p>GreenStage aims to raise $5,000 through this Indiegogo
campaign to cover the productions costs of <i>The
Bacchae</i> so that our performances can remain FREE and accessible to all who
wish to enjoy a play, regardless of their financial means. </p>
<h3><b>What we need</b></h3>
<p>Our $5,000 goal will cover two main expenses:</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span><b>Rent of
Stage One Theatre</b> at North Seattle Community College, where we will perform
<i>The Bacchae</i> from Oct. 12–Nov. 2. It
costs a lot more to rent a theater with walls and a ceiling than it does to
show up in a park!</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span><b>Stage Blood</b>—lots

  Blood Drive for

The Bacchae is one of the great Greek tragedies. A central figure is the young Greek God Dionysus,known by the Romans as Bacchus, the wine god. His parties were so wild the term bacchanalia was coined to describe them, and The Bacchae includes gods with mommy issues, wild Maenads, drunken revelry, lust, jealousy, revenge, cannibalism, cross-dressing, sex, drugs, rock and roll, and blood.
When the script calls for blood, we always feel more is better.
Our goal: $5,000
GreenStage aims to raise $5,000 through this Indiegogo
campaign to cover the productions costs of The
Bacchae so that our performances can remain FREE and accessible to all who
wish to enjoy a play, regardless of their financial means. 
What we need
Our $5,000 goal will cover two main expenses:
· 
Rent of
Stage One Theatre at North Seattle Community College, where we will perform
The Bacchae from Oct. 12–Nov. 2. It
costs a lot more to rent a theater with walls and a ceiling than it does to
show up in a park!
· 
Stage Blood—lots
of it, for rehearsals, performances, and to splatter on anyone crazy enough
to sit in the first row or to wear white to the show.
Amounts raised beyond the $5,000 goal will help us build sets
and props, wash all of that blood out of the costumes every day, compensate our
cast and crew, and support our educational programs.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>For over 13 years now, Freeplay Dance Crew has performed as a company.  We started out as just a bunch of people who wanted more dance in our lives than weekly dance classes offered.  We wanted to choreograph, create, pick out music, find places to perform and people to share it with.  After a few years of making fun pieces and challenging ourselves to perform alongside some incredible local hip hop companies, we began evolving in a new way.  Instead of just creating pieces that were cute and high energy, we started creating work that held meaning to us, personally, and communally.  We began making performances around our personal expressions – of gender, sexuality, relationship, race, culture, heritage, and very intimate personal experiences.  And we started putting these things on stage.  And as a company we evolved from short hip hop performances that made statements about gay marriage, to evening length shows that explored the cycles of death, dying and rebirth, the relationship of gender to political activism, and the interconnectivity of human experience.  And what we found along the way was that not only were WE as a company more invested in the work we created, but that the authenticity of our voices coming through our work resonated with the people who came to see us perform.  We weren’t trying to make an impact, we just DID.  Because it was real, and honest and true.</p>
<p>Along the way, we met and befriended <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/pages/Prince-On-Point-Dance-Company/165784236777622?fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>P.O.P.</strong> (Prince On Point)</a>, a collective of eclectic dancers with roots in everything from Ballet and Modern to Old Skool Funk and House. Founded in 2009 by lead choreographer, Shereen Prince, these dancers share a fondness for getting down and bringing their whole selves to the work. From speech therapist to neurobiologist, from fierce activist to nurse practitioner, from life coach to students of life and love, these dancers rock it on the dance floor and off. We are so excited to be dancing with P.O.P.!</p>
<p>So here we are in 2013.  And now it makes sense why we’re doing this show about spirituality.  Because Freeplay doesn’t just make shows around abstract concepts, we make shows about what is needed and happening in our lives right now.  And right now the world is disconnected from its spirit.  In a place where connection is defined by updated statuses and tweets, we are more isolated than ever, and struggle to find true connection with one another; we’re grasping for the thread that connects us all as human beings, globally, universally.  That thread is our spirituality, literally, our spirits.<br/><br/>This is the idea behind our upcoming show, “Re/Genesis” -- a performance on the re-discovering and re-claiming of spirituality.  Spirituality as every individual experiences for themselves.  And each experience, different and diverse from someone else’s, still comes from the same heart space which we all have. That space in our chest that leaps when we hear certain kinds of music, or words, or when we meditate, or when we  move. <br/><br/>This isn’t a show about religion, it’s a story about how we are all spiritual beings no matter how that manifests, and this spirituality which, no matter how hard we try to use it divisively against one another behind a curtain of religion, is in fact a connective tissue between us all as living things.</p>

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>In February 1944, a 2nd Lt. American bombardier named Warren Arieux was shot down and taken prisoner by the Nazis. He was taken to Barth, Germany to the Stalag Luft I POW camp.  Upon arrival, the YMCA gave each prisoner a journal called the Wartime Log.

Based on the rich material found in this journal—and other information collected about the Stalag Luft I camp—a new play has been developed by myself and an ensemble of four men.<br/><br/>The ensemble has transformed a seemingly disjointed, jumbled book into a story of brotherhood, loss, love, greed, hope, and sacrifice. <br/></p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We are rapidly losing the men and women who served in WWII.  Each day more and more of The Greatest Generation die.  It's vital we tell this story, share this experience while they're still here.  Bring your grandparents to see the show with you!  Talk to them about their WWII experience before it's too late.<br/><br/></p>
<p>I was struck by how rare this story is.  We've all seen movies or plays 
set in the WWII era covering the holocaust, the battlefield, death 
camps, Nazis and occasionally the horrors of the Japanese POW camps.  
But how often do we see or hear about the Allied POWs in Germany?  This 
play provides a rare view inside the day-to-day life of a Stalag Luft.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This money will go directly to the production designers and actors in the show.  Each designer and actor will receive a $500 artistic fee.  Additional funding comes from a grant from the City of Houston through the Houston Arts Alliance.  The grant primarily covers the production costs of renting the theater space, equipment and promotions.  We need your help to pay the artists! <br/><br/></p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Tom Lee, the main character in Tea and Sympathy, is a school boy ostracized for being different.  Because he often plays the female character in plays and tends to have a sensitive side, the school culture labels him as a homosexual.  Society’s tendency to stereotype, hate and fear that which is different takes center-stage in this drama that explores sexuality, ethics, and the power of mob-mentality.  We, as a theatre company, are dedicated to bringing to life this story, while asking the question ""What does it mean to be a man?""</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Rehearsals are beginning in January and the show plans to open Mid-March in a quaint venue space in Manhattan.  There is already a driector, stage manager, and marketing professional hired.  Everyone on the production team is dedicated to creating a phenomenal production.  </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This show will be presented to those in the local community in addition to many schools groups.  We are committed to creating a dialogue amongst teenagers to address how they can show the utmost compassion to their classmates and what hatred, ridicule, and mob mentality can do.  In addition, a portion of the box office proceeds will be benefitting the Trevor Project: an organization for preventing teen suicide amongst LGBT youth.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Without theatre to raise awareness, the local community may not be aware of how much an issue this is and students may engage in hateful/violent activities without being aware of the impact of their actions.   </p>

<p><strong><em> --<strong>Ben Harney  BAMSS Founder/Director - Tony Award Winner-Dreamgirls      </strong></em></strong></p>
<p>""For the last 14 years, we have helped transform the lives of children through their participation in our artistic programs. This summer is no different.</p>
<p>Through our <strong>Fund-a-Child</strong> campaign, you can help a child attend our summer theatre workshop.</p>
<p>Did you know theatre skills teach life skills? BAMSS Theatre Works uses multiple theatre disciplines to help young people and adults gain an understanding of their value and service to their community as creative communicators.</p>
<p>In our summer workshops, participants sing, dance and act as we engage them in the exciting process of storytelling. Young people explore who they are, through a theatrical experience they will never forget<em>."" </em> </p>
<p>“<em>This company has taught me that I can do great things. I was offered so many academic summer internships but I turned them all down because I wanted to come back to BAMSS."" --Brittney</em></p>
<p>Join BAMSS Theatre Works <a href=""http://www.bamsstheatreworksny.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.bamsstheatreworksny.org</a> in helping Britney and others like her grow through an amazing musical theatre workshop. Youth and young adults spend 5 weeks singing, dancing and acting. The workshop culminates in a production that a great time for the entire family. This year is no different! We are producing a summer workshop of <strong><em>The WIZ </em></strong>a time honored story that teaches us the value of family and friends and to believe in ourselves.</p>
<p> <img alt=""WIZ Summer 2012 flyer"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://sphotos.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/11828_441000765912707_1482682996_n.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title='BAMSS Inc. Presents ""The Wiz""'/>                      </p>
<p><strong>We Need You To Help other Boys and Girls like Britney!</strong></p>
<p>BAMSS prices are kept low to include as many young people as possible. Our tuition is only $650 plus a $25 registration fee. That’s $28 a day for a 5-week program. This is a deal that is like nothing else in NYC, and yet, every year there are kids who want to participate in our program, but can't because money is an issue for their families.</p>
<p>THIS year, you can help!</p>
<p>Here on Indiegogo, you have the opportunity to sponsor a child for our summer workshop. Here are the testimonials of three young people who's lives have been changed by our programs:</p>
<p>""...<em>This program challenged me in so many ways. Even though I've been in plays before, this program was different. I met so many new and interesting people. Working with so much talent in one place challenged me to work even harder throughout the program and my life.""</em></p>
<p><em>- Brittney</em></p>
<p><em>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- </em></p>
<p><em>""...When I entered BAMSS...for a summer theatre workshop, it totally changed my whole perspective of performers and performing... I went back in 2008 to do their junior production of Annie. I really have been blessed to be able to work with these incredible people. I am going to be a senior this fall because of the foundation...that I've gotten being in this program (BAMSS) , I am going to pursue it in college and as a career."" </em></p>
<p><em>- Dakota </em></p>
<p><em>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</em></p>
<p><em>""What BAMSS means to me is pretty much everything. Acting and singing is my life, so to have both of them put together (and I don’t get this a lot) is pretty awesome. I first joined BAMSS when I was 10 years old, and I never left. I was really shy back then, but now I have made a lot of new friends and I'm a lot less shy now. BAMSS is my happy place.""</em></p>
<p><em>- Kristiana</em></p>

<p><strong>What We Will Do For You!</strong></p>

<p> </p></div>","Who BAMSS is and What We Do! 
 --Ben Harney  BAMSS Founder/Director - Tony Award Winner-Dreamgirls      
""For the last 14 years, we have helped transform the lives of children through their participation in our artistic programs. This summer is no different.
Through our Fund-a-Child campaign, you can help a child attend our summer theatre workshop.
Did you know theatre skills teach life skills? BAMSS Theatre Works uses multiple theatre disciplines to help young people and adults gain an understanding of their value and service to their community as creative communicators.
In our summer workshops, participants sing, dance and act as we engage them in the exciting process of storytelling. Young people explore who they are, through a theatrical experience they will never forget.""  
“This company has taught me that I can do great things. I was offered so many academic summer internships but I turned them all down because I wanted to come back to BAMSS."" --Brittney
Join BAMSS Theatre Works www.bamsstheatreworksny.org in helping Britney and others like her grow through an amazing musical theatre workshop. Youth and young adults spend 5 weeks singing, dancing and acting. The workshop culminates in a production that a great time for the entire family. This year is no different! We are producing a summer workshop of The WIZ a time honored story that teaches us the value of family and friends and to believe in ourselves.
                       
We Need You To Help other Boys and Girls like Britney!
BAMSS prices are kept low to include as many young people as possible. Our tuition is only $650 plus a $25 registration fee. That’s $28 a day for a 5-week program. This is a deal that is like nothing else in NYC, and yet, every year there are kids who want to participate in our program, but can't because money is an issue for their families.
THIS year, you can help!
Here on Indiegogo, you have the opportunity to sponsor a child for our summer workshop. Here are the testimonials of three young people who's lives have been changed by our programs:
""...This program challenged me in so many ways. Even though I've been in plays before, this program was different. I met so many new and interesting people. Working with so much talent in one place challenged me to work even harder throughout the program and my life.""
- Brittney
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
""...When I entered BAMSS...for a summer theatre workshop, it totally changed my whole perspective of performers and performing... I went back in 2008 to do their junior production of Annie. I really have been blessed to be able to work with these incredible people. I am going to be a senior this fall because of the foundation...that I've gotten being in this program (BAMSS) , I am going to pursue it in college and as a career."" 
- Dakota 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
""What BAMSS means to me is pretty much everything. Acting and singing is my life, so to have both of them put together (and I don’t get this a lot) is pretty awesome. I first joined BAMSS when I was 10 years old, and I never left. I was really shy back then, but now I have made a lot of new friends and I'm a lot less shy now. BAMSS is my happy place.""
- Kristiana

<h3>69 Love Scenes</h3>
<p>Austin's performance community is known nationally for two things--exciting, innovative new plays and improv. Gnap! Theater Projects is the only company in Austin doing both.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Last year, we did a workshop production of a new show called 69 Love Scenes. The play is inspired by the Magnetic Fields' triple album 69 Love Songs, and each scene in the play drew it's title from one of the titular songs on that album, drawing from elements of the album such as the space between sincerity and insincerity, wry humor, and an effortless ability to slip into any genre. It's a whirlwind of a play about love, love songs, and the use and abuse of both.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We learned a lot from that production, we've rewritten and revised a lot, and now we're remounting the full production. It's by far the biggest show we've ever undertaken, and we're asking for your help to make sure we can pull this show off at the level it needs to make it not just good,  but perfect.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What Your Contribution Would Mean to Us</h3>
<p>We'll be honest with you--we're a lot more used to doing improv shows whose technical needs are modest to non-existent. A scripted show relying on tons of costumes, props, and a set is not cheap. We're in a position where we can and already have made the production come together out of our normal operating budget. By gaining your financial support for this show, though, we can make sure that our other, less expensive shows later in the year aren't hampered by too much of our budget going for this one. Kind of twofer, really--help this show and you help other shows, too!</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The money we're raising is all going toward the production costs of this show--things like the props, costumes, and set construction costs. And if we make our goal, this will allow for the money we make at the box office to be used to pay for our lovely cast, not just for lovely objects.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>In exchange, you get access to all kinds of great stuff, including tickets and print materials from the show, to season passes to Gnap! Theater Projects shows, and more.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Whether you give or not, we'd also love it if you passed on word of our endeavors to any fans of theater, improv, or the Magnetic Fields in your life. It's easy to share links for the campaign on Facebook and other social media outlets. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Thanks a million!!</p>

<h3>About us.</h3>
<p>What does it mean to be a Beast?<br/><br/> We all have something to say. We all have something to fight. We all have something to hate. We all have something to love. We are human; we are animals. We live in a polite, confined society where we avoid<span class=""text_exposed_show""> conflict, fear physical contact and communication, and our Prime Minister shakes his own children's hands when he drops them off at school. We're taught to repress what is natural to us so much that what is primal instinct now feels unnatural and strange. To be a beast of the theatre is to explore the animal that lives inside all of us, to go back to square one, how we all started, and journey through the things that truly make us human without the social constructs of society. Our work is to encourage each other to set that beast free. Feel everything. Repress nothing and truly discover what makes us more alike than we think.<br/><br/> There is a beast inside all of us, the question is — will you let it roar?</span></p>
<p>Beasts of the Theatre is an emerging theatre collective stemming from a group of graduates from the University of Guelph. In September 2011, Lindsay Finnie and Andrew Cromwell met for coffee to discuss the ever-so-popular question, ""what do we do with theatre degrees now that we've graduated?""</p>
<p>Within hours, we decided to create rather than wait for an opportunity to find us. In the months to follow, Adam Pellerine, Meredith Henry, Robin Wright and Erika Thompson joined and completed the Beasts Production Team. Together, we are striving to develop and promote the works of new Canadian artists and are currently producing our first play<em> 'Grey Ground</em>' at the 2012 Toronto Fringe Festival.</p>
<p>In an effort to help raise money for our upcoming production we would like to ask you for a donation that will go directly towards the costs of the project.</p>
<h3>So what's <em>'Grey Ground</em>' all about?</h3>
<p>Molly has attacked someone. She is a loner, a loser, and now a monster. Standing hated on the outskirts of life, she has no one. There are two sides to every story and Molly is caught in the grey ground in between. <span class=""messageBody""><span class=""text_exposed_show"">Blending traditional dialogue based theatre with choreographed movement and physical storytelling</span></span>, 'Grey Ground' examines when is the right time to stand up for yourself in a place where everyone listens, but no one really sees?</p>

<h3>Where the Money is Going.</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Our participation in the Toronto Fringe Festival is being done entirely not-for-profit. Many of the costs associated with putting on this production are currently coming out of pocket. Your donation would go directly towards the production and will help us to recover some of our costs. </p>
<p><strong>Our expenses include:</strong></p>
<p>Rehearsal Space.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is where the bulk of the proceeds will go. Many rehearsal spaces in the city range in price from $15 to $20 an hour to rent. The average theatre production has between 60 and 80 hours of rehearsal.</li>
</ul>
<p>Publicity</p>
<ul>
<li>Printing of Posters and Postcards, Web domain maintenance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Set. </p>
<ul>
<li>Though we will have a minimal set, there are certain props that we will need to purchase.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we don't reach our goal, we will still take what our donors have generously donated and apply it towards the costs of production.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution has several benefits. On the one hand it will help us as we work through the creative process of bringing our production to the 2012 Toronto Fringe Festival. On a larger scale it demonstrates your support for the arts, and your support for Canadian artists.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are unable to make a donation, that's ok. There are other ways you can help. One of the most effective ways to lend a hand to us is by word of mouth. Spread the word about our show. Come show your support during the Festival (July 4th - 15th, 2012). Or tell your friends and family to look us up online. With your help, we can encourage people to support Canadian theatre.</p>
<p>Theatre is about the relationship between theatre creators and the audience. Without you, the audience, theatre couldn't happen. </p>
<p>Thank you for your support. We really appreciate it.</p>

<p>A Breaking Through The Box Production</p>
<p>World Premiere at Luna Stage in West Orange, NJ</p>
<p>November 11-13, 2016- Friday and Saturday at 7:30 pm, Saturday and Sunday at 2:00 pm</p>
<p>Half Hour Talk Backs with the Writer/Director and Cast after Every Performance</p>
<p>Tickets: $15 for Students and Seniors and $20 for Adults</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are Breaking Through the Box, a new non-profit theater company making a name for ourselves in the tri-state area. Founded and run by young professional artists in the summer of 2016, BTTB has a simple yet strong mission statement: to produce new work, or new takes on old work, utilizing the skills and talent of young, up and coming artists. In tandem with this vision, BTTB would like to establish ourselves as a place for education. We plan to create an environment of artists from all aspects of theatre to encourage and teach children and young adults to follow their passions- and embrace their individuality while doing it. </p>
<p><br/> </p>
<p>BTTB made our official debut this past August at the Flea Theater in NYC with the original play Inferno: A New Work About Sin. This season, we have returned to our home base of NJ to produce three shows and share with the immediate theatre community what we represent. Please like Breaking Through the Box Theater Company on Facebook to stay up to date on all of our season information and for opportunities to work with the us. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>As a start-up company and a non-profit, any and all donations are sincerely appreciated. Your generosity helps pay for the rental of our space, our props, costumes, and technical equipment, and most importantly to pay the amazing artists who dedicate their time and talent to this company. Once these funds cover our initial budget for this production, they will go on to support the other productions of this season: Almost, Maine in February 2017, and Titus Andronicus in June 2017. </p>

<p>It is with much gratitude that we thank every single donor for their support, and their belief in us and the art we are creating.</p>

What Is The Show?
 
Nolan is being watched. Only, the past and present have gotten so foggy since she moved from Vancouver to Toronto, she can’t tell whether the eyes on her back are real or imagined. Birdwatching moves seamlessly between dance and dialogue as Nolan struggles to ground herself in the here and now.
Birdwatching was the first full-length play Jack Hayes had ever written, and, shortly after completing it, he was lucky enough to have it produced by the Phoenix Theatre's Student Alternative Theatre Company as a part of its 2015 spring season! In the year and a half since then, Birdwatching has grown and developed along with its author, transforming from a first to a second and then third and final draft during its Fringe rehearsal process.

</h3></b></h1><i></i>
<p><i><b>How Can I Keep from
Singing</b> </i>pays tribute to the music of Eva Cassidy – A North American
treasure. Featuring the talented and versatile vocalist, Cayla Brooke, the show
takes you on a journey from Eva Cassidy’s humble beginnings in Washington DC,
to some of her most magical moments on stage and ultimately her untimely death
in 1996.</p>
<p>“People have either heard of Eva – and are devoted fans,”
commented Cayla Brooke. “Or they have yet to be! For both groups, this show is a
magical experience.”</p>
<p>Featuring over 25 songs it’s an audible feast of musical
styles ranging from jazz and blues, to gospel, country and folk. “Just none of
that pop crap,” as Eva would say. Where else can you hear Songbird, Over the
Rainbow, Wayfaring Stranger, Fields of Gold and Danny Boy all in setting? Cayla
deftly blends these songs together seasoning them with her own brand of wit and
sparkle.</p>
<p>Cayla is joined on stage by the charismatic and gifted
vocalist Tom Pickett adding some funk and good old fashioned soul to the mix.
The four piece band is led by Bill Sample on piano and featuring Rene Worst on
bass, David Ivaz on guitar and Buff Allen on drums. </p>
<p>We are not backed by a big theatre company or corporation. Its just us. A Group of musicians and performers who believe in this project. The
money donated will go towards the start up costs of putting on another run of
the show in the Spring of 2014. It is during this very important run that minor
changes to the script and music will be made in an effort to get the show tour

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Daniella Khoury and I am the Logistics Director of the Roswell High School Theatre Troupe. Our troupe is devoted to creating amazing shows and has plans of producing a few shows soon such as A Midsummer Night's Dream and our own student-written student-directed festival called Short Attention Span Theatre. A main component to our productions is our amazing lighting design. Our lighting expert has created amazing designs for shows such as Hairspray, Antigone and Crimes of the Heart, all with a lighting board around 23 years old. We would like to replace the old board with a new Element lighting board and buy a Macbook Air to use as a monitor. </p>

<h2><strong>***STRETCH GOAL***</strong></h2>
<p>Thanks so many, we reached our goal in one week! A HUGE thank you to our 58 backers for their amazing donations, and appreciation for helping spread the word, liking our posts on FB, or telling us that you believed in our artistic voice.</p>
<p>With 20 days left in the campaign, and lots of excitement, we'd like to announce a stretch goal. If we can raise $5250 total (an extra $1500), we will be able to document TaikoWorks 2017 show documented by a professional videographer, and create video excerpts of the performance that can be shared with all. </p>
<p>We hope you will join this exciting journey with us!</p>
<h3>Goodbye, Hello: A new artistic leap for Unit Souzou</h3>
<p>As we emerge into our 3rd year of sharing relevant stories through drum and dance, we are excited to break new ground in our work. We ask for your support to activate our first-ever annual TaikoWorks show. Beginning a new yearly tradition, TaikoWorks will be an opportunity to celebrate and showcase our most current ruminations of both finished and unfinished work.</p>
<p>This 3rd year represents big transitions in the life of our company in which we leave behind the start up nature of our “youth” and bloom into a new phase of growth and beginnings. Help us say goodbye to the past, and hello to a new era in Unit Souzou’s artistic journey. Your contribution towards our Goodbye, Hello campaign will truly bring to life the multiple meanings of souzou - “creation,” “imagination,” and “noisy” in new and exciting ways.</p>
<h3>About TaikoWorks 2017</h3>
<p>On August 30th, Unit Souzou will present TaikoWorks 2017, our first-ever annual showcase of current artistic ruminations. As our inaugural year, we will ignite our creativity and imagination by hosting a site-specific performance exploring themes of goodbye from sacred formal farewells, casual everyday parting, and unforeseen, sometime tragic transitions.</p>
<p>The site of this work has deep and layered significance for Unit Souzou. It will take place at the Jade APANO Multicultural Space (JAMS), which has been our home since our inception. In the fall, JAMS will close down in its current form as it begins transformation into a new affordable housing and community space. While we are excited for this important new community project, it will be a bittersweet goodbye to our artistic home of the last three years. Using the unique shape and layout of the building, this performance will span three rooms, inviting the audience to physically embody the act of parting. It will also be a symbolic and meaningful goodbye to this gathering space, allowing us to create a sacred and intentional farewell for all attending.</p>TaikoWorks will feature exciting artistic milestones:<ul>
<li>Debut of the Unit Souzou professional ensemble in Portland</li>
<li>Premiere of new composition, Entangled, composed by ensemble member, David Wells for the Unit Souzou community group</li>
<li>Performance of thematic works inspired by the sacredness of goodbye created by the Unit Souzou professional ensemble</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>TaikoWorks 2017 will take place Wednesday, August 30th 8:00 pm at the Jade APANO Multicultural Space (JAMS), 8114 SE Division Street, Portland, OR.</i></p>
<h3>It takes a village to make art!</h3>
<p>We love to create new work, but we can't do it without community support. Contributions to the Goodbye, Hello campaign will allow UNIT SOUZOU to fully embrace and realize a new artistic milestone. We hope you will join us on this journey.</p>
<h3>About Unit Souzou</h3>
<p>'Souzou' can be written in three ways meaning 'creation' (創造), 'imagination' (想), or 'noisy' (騒々), alluding to a force by which new ideas are born and take shape in the world. Inspired by these words, the mission of Unit Souzou is to build creative, imaginative works while honoring the history and roots of the taiko art form. The core of Unit Souzou’s artistic voice is personal and authentic, sound shaped and inspired by form and by movement. The essence of Unit Souzou is an expressive blend of taiko and Japanese folk dance, forging new traditions for evolving communities. In addition to creating groundbreaking professional theatrical works, Unit Souzou is deeply committed to share taiko through community performances and collaborations, public classes for adults and youth, and school-based education programs.</p>
<p>Unit Souzou was founded in 2014 by co-directors Michelle Fujii and Toru Watanabe, relentless innovators at the forefront of a growing artistic movement within the worldwide taiko community. Fujii and Watanabe met at Warabi-za, Japan’s foremost traditional folk dance troupe based in Northern Japan. The two have worked with premiere North American taiko groups including San Jose Taiko, On Ensemble, Portland Taiko, TAIKOPROJECT, and Shasta Taiko</p>
<p>Unit Souzou has received support from Regional Arts &amp; Culture Council and the National Performance Network (NPN), and was a featured showcase performer at NPN’s 2015 Annual Meeting. UNIT SOUZOU has toured across the west in Oregon, Washington, California, Montana, Utah, Arizona, and Wyoming, performing professional theatrical work and teaching taiko workshops. They are founding teaching artists with the Right Brain Initiative and are on the teaching artist roster with Young Audiences of Oregon &amp; SW Washington.</p>

<strong>Take care of the Venue</strong> --- We have a wonderful arrangement with the curators at Arete Gallery in Greenpoint who are doing a lot to make this show a reality. $300 of our budget will go towards transforming this non-traditional space. </li>
<li>
<strong>Help us reach new audiences</strong> --- We work fiercely to promote our shows. We put the word out through guerilla techniques like wheatpasting or enlisting bar patrons to vandalize art for instagram, as well as more traditional means like paid advertising. While paying artists is always our highest priority, throwing $650 into Return-On-Investment doesn't hurt. </li>

<p><em>“I had decided to allow no room in the universe for something which shamed and frightened me. I succeeded very well—by not looking at the universe, by not looking at myself, by remaining, in effect, in constant motion.”</em></p>
<p>James Baldwin, <em>Giovanni’s Room</em></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>My name is Andrew Skeels and I am a dancer and choreographer with Les Grands Ballets Canadiens de Montréal.  I am starting work on a new choreographic project: a dance adaptation of James Baldwin’s <em>Giovanni’s Room.</em>  Published in 1956, <em>Giovanni’s Room</em> is a provocative and controversial work well ahead of its time, which explores sexuality, repression, isolation and masculinity in society.  In order to distance himself from his family and society, David, an American too ashamed to accept his sexuality, moves to Paris where he meets—and falls in love with—Giovanni.  His intense love for another man deeply frightens David, leading him to make a decision to leave Giovanni in order to marry an American woman.  What ensues is Giovanni’s downfall and subsequently David’s.  Many of the book’s themes remain profoundly relevant, and I am convinced that this emotionally charged storyline will make a very stirring ballet.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The piece will be developed over a five-week intensive rehearsal process beginning late May 2013.  Featuring five dancers from Les Grands Ballets Canadiens de Montreal, the work will premiere in September as part of Montreal’s Festival TransAtlantique.   </strong></p>
<p><strong>I am asking for help to bring this project to fruition.  I am seeking to raise $3,000 in this fundraising campaign, enough to pay one of the five dancers involved with this project.  Exceeding this goal, of course, would greatly help in the subsequent fundraising phases.  </strong></p>
<p><strong>This production has the potential to be truly exceptional.  The dancers, all current and former soloists of Les Grands Ballets, are well acquainted with and thoroughly invested in my creative process.  These artists are distinguished by their professionalism and matchless talents, and I know each one of them will deliver a riveting performance.  Andrei Przybytkowski, a Montreal-based composer whose striking music has been used by a number of contemporary dance choreographers, is composing the score for the ballet.</strong></p>
<p><strong>As a donor, you will be supporting a unique dance project.  </strong><strong>Choreography has been my vehicle of artistic expression for 15 years.  My works have been presented by dance companies, festivals, universities, and museums throughout North America, including Colorado Ballet, Festival Ballet Providence, WestWave Dance Festival San Francisco, Museum of Contemporary Art Denver, and Colorado State University.  It is my hope that you will consider supporting this project. </strong></p>

My name is Andrew Skeels and I am a dancer and choreographer with Les Grands Ballets Canadiens de Montréal.  I am starting work on a new choreographic project: a dance adaptation of James Baldwin’s Giovanni’s Room.  Published in 1956, Giovanni’s Room is a provocative and controversial work well ahead of its time, which explores sexuality, repression, isolation and masculinity in society.  In order to distance himself from his family and society, David, an American too ashamed to accept his sexuality, moves to Paris where he meets—and falls in love with—Giovanni.  His intense love for another man deeply frightens David, leading him to make a decision to leave Giovanni in order to marry an American woman.  What ensues is Giovanni’s downfall and subsequently David’s.  Many of the book’s themes remain profoundly relevant, and I am convinced that this emotionally charged storyline will make a very stirring ballet.
The piece will be developed over a five-week intensive rehearsal process beginning late May 2013.  Featuring five dancers from Les Grands Ballets Canadiens de Montreal, the work will premiere in September as part of Montreal’s Festival TransAtlantique.   
I am asking for help to bring this project to fruition.  I am seeking to raise $3,000 in this fundraising campaign, enough to pay one of the five dancers involved with this project.  Exceeding this goal, of course, would greatly help in the subsequent fundraising phases.  
This production has the potential to be truly exceptional.  The dancers, all current and former soloists of Les Grands Ballets, are well acquainted with and thoroughly invested in my creative process.  These artists are distinguished by their professionalism and matchless talents, and I know each one of them will deliver a riveting performance.  Andrei Przybytkowski, a Montreal-based composer whose striking music has been used by a number of contemporary dance choreographers, is composing the score for the ballet.
As a donor, you will be supporting a unique dance project.  Choreography has been my vehicle of artistic expression for 15 years.  My works have been presented by dance companies, festivals, universities, and museums throughout North America, including Colorado Ballet, Festival Ballet Providence, WestWave Dance Festival San Francisco, Museum of Contemporary Art Denver, and Colorado State University.  It is my hope that you will consider supporting this project. 
I invite you to search my name on www.youtube.com to view some of my recent works or visit my website, www.andrewskeels.com.
Warmly,
Andrew Skeels

</h4></span></span></div>","LET US TELL YOU A STORY

When actors Smith and Jones take on the seemingly innocuous roles of Hal and Hubble, respectively, the stage runs red with more than dramatic lighting. A totalitarian regime, eponymously named the Party, has run roughshod over the politics of the day, taking over the theaters while threatening the very fabric of life and artistic certainty. But is it just the nation's minds that are threatened? A black comedy by Tim Ginley SO2SPEAK pulls back the curtain on a deadly realm where art and politics collide, and body counts mount. Directed by the frenetic mind of Stewart Matthew (Die Zombie Die, Lonely Bear) this dark comedic journey is a movement piece that meets the Pinteresque toe to toe, never letting up until the final curtain cull is complete.
WHO WE ARE


S02SPEAK is the debut piece from an new theatre company in the Ottawa area, incite:LAB.  We have mandated ourselves as a new creation collective that intends on building a healthy competitive theatre community: one new play at a time. 
WHY SHOULD YOU HELP
Herein lies the importance of this campaign to me. My name is Tim Ginley and this is my company. I am a writer/actor/director impassioned by the creation of new and challenging theatre, but more than that I wish to create cohesion and  community among creative theatre practitioners. A successful show, with paid actors, director and stage manager and no debts to move forward brings my company one step closer to creating a community of creating individuals.
In light of economic realities and in the spirit of DIY theatre incite:LAB seeks merely the money required to pay for our stage and fees for our director and stage manager. Thereby increasing a net profits for the actors to share. 

$1000 will pay for the venue

$300 will pay the director and stage managers their nominal fee


$200 will pay for advertising and with that a company moves forward without debt.  


And a community gets stronger because one company has made good. Thanks to contributors like you. 
WHAT DO YOU GET
As a contributor to incite:LAB and the success of SO2SPEAK each kind and generous heart gets:
             * automatic membership to incite:LAB which will feature an emailed    newsletter and free admission to reading and draws for tickets to staged events
Seeing as anyone who has given to a new work collective must be interested in seeing new playwrights write contributors will be offered judging privileges at future readings and directed presentations. Further perks include

free tickets
invitation to all incite:LAB events
signed posters

good karma


But the reality of theatre is an expensive one. Should incite:LAB not makes its $1500 goal it shall then be left to move forward as all theatre does. Judge on the success of the piece itself, alone and the funds from the producers pocket will severely restrict the future.
WHAT DO WE GET
I have self produced plays before and while it is a labour of love, it is economically intensive. Shortfalls come out of the pocket, and failure wears away the ability to continue to create. Audience can only help so much. It is the one of the realities of the marketplace. And while I would love to brag of success after success, but as this is the first, I cannot. I do however believe it will be the first of many. Reaching out to the world makes the communal spirit of theatre more real, more palpable. Sadly not every one can get out to see what the world of theatre provides so contributing a few dollars helps to grow the world of creation.
TELL SOMEONE WHO CARES
And if you cannot help financially then tell those who can. Tell those interested in theatre that a company needs help to build a community of story tellers. Share with them our request and encourage them to give what they can to make small dreams into big realities.
AND THANKS SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME.

<h3 style="""">Our Story</h3>
<p style="""">We are Bandwagon Productions - a small entertainment start-up founded by husband and wife team, Charlotte Cohn &amp; Jason Odell Williams. This play, BALTIMORE IN BLACK AND WHITE, is our first production under Bandwagon, but we know it will not be our last. The play is an outrageously hilarious, laugh-out-loud comedy about racism, set against the backdrop of Baltimore, Maryland in 2007 and 1987. Eight actors play 17 different roles in a tapestry of scenes that focus on a Jewish girl and a black guy who reconnect after 20 years, date, fall in love, and get married. Their friends and family however are not all excited for the impending nuptials. The play deals with what you can and can't say when it comes to race and and how far we've come (and how far we haven't come) over the past 20 years. If you haven't already, we recommend watching the video above, and then visiting our website, <a href=""http://www.baltimoreinblackandwhite.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.baltimoreinblackandwhite.com</a>.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b></b>Vanport, between Portland and Vancouver, was built
in 110 days in 1942 to accommodate the influx of wartime shipyard workers,
becoming the second largest city of Oregon. At its peak, it was home to
40,000 people, including 6,000 African Americans, three times as many as had
lived in all of Portland two years before. It was one of the first integrated
communities in North America and its largest wartime public housing project.
The town included a number of noteworthy institutions, such as K-12 schools,
24-hour day care, grocery stores, a health-care facility for shipyard workers,
and the Vanport Extension Center, which became Portland State University. </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">On Memorial Day
in 1948, a flood wiped out the entire city within a matter of hours, displacing
12,000 residents. This tragedy forced the overwhelmingly homogeneous city of
Portland, and the state of Oregon, down the path toward interracial progress.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Today, Vanport
is memorialized with only a few interpretive signs to mark what was once the
second largest city in Oregon. During the dialogues following the screening of
our short documentaries, people of all generations consistently say they were
never taught this chapter of history. Those who have heard of it usually are
only aware of the flood.  </p><h1 style=""text-align: justify;"">

The History of Vanport
Vanport, between Portland and Vancouver, was built
in 110 days in 1942 to accommodate the influx of wartime shipyard workers,
becoming the second largest city of Oregon. At its peak, it was home to
40,000 people, including 6,000 African Americans, three times as many as had
lived in all of Portland two years before. It was one of the first integrated
communities in North America and its largest wartime public housing project.
The town included a number of noteworthy institutions, such as K-12 schools,
24-hour day care, grocery stores, a health-care facility for shipyard workers,
and the Vanport Extension Center, which became Portland State University. On Memorial Day
in 1948, a flood wiped out the entire city within a matter of hours, displacing
12,000 residents. This tragedy forced the overwhelmingly homogeneous city of
Portland, and the state of Oregon, down the path toward interracial progress.Today, Vanport
is memorialized with only a few interpretive signs to mark what was once the
second largest city in Oregon. During the dialogues following the screening of
our short documentaries, people of all generations consistently say they were
never taught this chapter of history. Those who have heard of it usually are
only aware of the flood.  
  2016VanportMosaic Festival 
The Vanport
Mosaic Festival is 4-day multi-disciplinary event that memorializes a unique
sociological experiment that forever altered Oregon’s racial history. On the
68th anniversary of the Vanport Flood, Memorial Day Weekend 2016, the Festival
will unite Portland area residents via historical and artistic tributes,
including screenings of oral histories, a play, poetry, music, tours,
educational and community dialogues, and exhibits of photos and artifacts. We
will honor former Vanport residents with a reunion and archive their oral
histories, photos, and artifacts.
We are a collective of storytellers, media makers,
artists, historians, educators, long-term Portland residents and newcomers who
seek to understand the construct of our social memory about this seemingly forgotten
piece of Oregon history. -- www.vanportmosaic.org.

“FURY
Factory redefines live theater.” San
Francisco Arts Monthly. 
Inspired
by New York festivals such as the ones hosted by PS122, HERE, and Under the
Radar, the FURY Factory is the only event of its
kind in the Bay Area.  For two jam-packed
weeks in July, 24 innovative theater
companies from all over the country will converge in San Francisco’s Mission District to create an outpouring of performance, artistic exchange, cross
pollination, panel discussions, and training events open to everyone -- but we simply cannot do it without your help.What We Need // Where The Funds Will Go
In order to bring these amazing artists and all of their energy to the Bay Area, a meeting ground must be provided. The FURY Factory is the only festival of its kind in
the Bay Area, and this is an
event about artists and community coming together in one place for a national dialogue.Providing the space for all these artists to perform in is no small feat, and with big spaces come big costs. The funds we are seeking to raise will pay for the rental of the 3 festival venues, and provide an amazing canvas for the participating artists to come play on.Help us bring these wonderful, innovative and
creative companies to the audiences of the Bay Area!We need to raise at least $10,000 by July 6 to be make this festival possible.If you can't make a donation at this time, there are many other ways to contribute to this campaign which are just as helpful!  * Email the link to this campaign, and information about the
festival, to friends, family, colleagues, etc.* Post the campaign link to your Facebook page,
Twitter feed or other social media.* Come see the work! There are so many shows to see, people to meet, and discussions to have; your presence is important to us!

donation will help fund the performance venues for the festival, without which this event would be impossible. You are bringing fantastic works to the Bay Area with your donation. You can find the full schedule and descriptions of all the shows here!

</h3> Billy est sourd de naissance. Ses parents ne lui ont jamais permis d'apprendre le langage des signes, de peur qu'il s'isole au sein de la communauté sourde et malentendante. Sa rencontre avec Sylvia, une malentendante en voie de devenir sourde, bouleversera son existence et éveillera en lui un désir d'expression par le langage des signes. Cet épanouissement soudain déstabilisera la cellule familiale et exacerbera des travers peu reluisants de sa personnalité. <br/><br/>Tribus est une pièce sur la communication et les subtilités du langage.

<h3>Who We Are...</h3>
<p>My name is Rainey Rowan and I am helping produce a new short play written by Alex Krasser with direction by Glenn Giron, an up and coming director here in NYC. The production is an original one-​act play called Waiting for the G in which Trey and Quint are on their way to an important job interview and waiting for a train that may or may not show up. As they are emotionally and physically worn down by circumstance and eccentric subway denizens, they struggle to find some sense of control, pushing their sanity and friendship to the brink.. This ​one-act is being produced at The Hudson Guild Theater as part of their NY WinterFest in January starring, Lori Bodinizzo, Eric Cotti, Sean Evans, Michael Maricondi, and Chase Slovak and WE NEED YOUR HELP to make it happen!  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need...</h3>
<p>We have set a goal of $2500 for our production costs and artists fees, which include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Artists Fees</li>
<li>Scenic Elements (like a REAL SUBWAY BENCH)</li>
<li>Props (like a REAL PHONE BOOTH)</li>
<li>Rehearsal Space</li>
<li>A HAND DRAWN Program</li>
</ul>
<p>If we don't reach our entire goal, we will divide the funds up evenly, with special regard to the needs of our artists, first and foremost.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Impact, Risks &amp; Challenges...</h3>
<p>Our biggest aim is to pay our creative team. Yes, having a fabulous set and ahmazing props is important, but it's invaluable to the integrity of our actors, scenic designer, sound designer, and the rest of our team to pay them for their artistry, effort and time. It is our utmost priority and our biggest challenge. We would like to set a high standard as an emerging production team, in an industry that oftentimes does not pay artists what they are owed. It is a challenge, but one we are ready to face head on.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help...</h3>
<p>If you can't monetarily contribute, that's okay! We get it, we are all starving artists to different degrees (at least metaphorically, eh?) BUT, that doesn't mean you can't help... you could:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share our campaign on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, ALL dating sites, and Gypsy Housing (May have been kidding about the last two, but maybe not!)</li>
<li>Talk about our campaign with your friends, family, co-workers, cab drivers, subway man-spreaders, and ex-best friends.</li>
<li>Use the Indiegogo share tools! It's super user friendly.</li>
<li>And, of course, come see the show!</li>

My name is Rainey Rowan and I am helping produce a new short play written by Alex Krasser with direction by Glenn Giron, an up and coming director here in NYC. The production is an original one-​act play called Waiting for the G in which Trey and Quint are on their way to an important job interview and waiting for a train that may or may not show up. As they are emotionally and physically worn down by circumstance and eccentric subway denizens, they struggle to find some sense of control, pushing their sanity and friendship to the brink.. This ​one-act is being produced at The Hudson Guild Theater as part of their NY WinterFest in January starring, Lori Bodinizzo, Eric Cotti, Sean Evans, Michael Maricondi, and Chase Slovak and WE NEED YOUR HELP to make it happen!  

What We Need...
We have set a goal of $2500 for our production costs and artists fees, which include:

Artists Fees
Scenic Elements (like a REAL SUBWAY BENCH)
Props (like a REAL PHONE BOOTH)
Rehearsal Space
A HAND DRAWN Program

If we don't reach our entire goal, we will divide the funds up evenly, with special regard to the needs of our artists, first and foremost.

Impact, Risks & Challenges...
Our biggest aim is to pay our creative team. Yes, having a fabulous set and ahmazing props is important, but it's invaluable to the integrity of our actors, scenic designer, sound designer, and the rest of our team to pay them for their artistry, effort and time. It is our utmost priority and our biggest challenge. We would like to set a high standard as an emerging production team, in an industry that oftentimes does not pay artists what they are owed. It is a challenge, but one we are ready to face head on.

Other Ways You Can Help...
If you can't monetarily contribute, that's okay! We get it, we are all starving artists to different degrees (at least metaphorically, eh?) BUT, that doesn't mean you can't help... you could:

Share our campaign on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, ALL dating sites, and Gypsy Housing (May have been kidding about the last two, but maybe not!)
Talk about our campaign with your friends, family, co-workers, cab drivers, subway man-spreaders, and ex-best friends.
Use the Indiegogo share tools! It's super user friendly.
And, of course, come see the show!

<h3>Testimonials </h3>
<p><i>“Morir Sonyando, Power Street’s most recent production puts a focus squarely on a topic that is both universal and incredibly personal to our community. Morir Sonyando looks at the very complicated subject of domestic violence seen through the lens of a Latino family. Along its heartbreaking journey Morir Sonyando investigates incarceration, substance abuse, immigration, hope and the irrevocable damage that the silence surrounding domestic violence often breeds. We watch a family, full of love and expectation, crumble and rebuild itself after a lifetime of violence leads to one choice that changes everything. Unlike so many other works on this topic there are no sinners or saints here. Each character is a beautifully drawn image of a mother, a daughter, a father, a son, complicated and shaped by the limitations and dreams that too often accompany being Latino in the United States. The play’s blending of culture, taboos, healing, and questions about what it means to be loving and free open up such an important dialogue about domestic violence in an attempt to look at it as a symptom of larger problems - like painful immigrations practices and incarceration that overwhelmingly punishes people of color - that plague so many American cities today.”</i></p>
<p><b>Tamanya Garza Director, Producer and Digital Marketing Specialist President of the Board of Directors, Azuka Theatre</b> </p>
<p><i>“The opportunity to attend Morir Sonyando was incredible for our students from Olney Charter High School. The students had never seen a play performed live, and it exposed them to a new area of art. Several of the students who came are English Language Learners who are emergent bilinguals. Seeing a play performed in Spanish and English was eye-opening for them--they expressed excitement about seeing a professional play performed in multiple languages. The subject matter was also compelling. Immediately after the play, students started talking about their own experiences witnessing domestic violence. Seeing professional actors take this subject matter seriously opened the door for them to see their own experiences as part of larger structural issues, and allowed them to share with each other. They left the theater feeling bigger and seeing themselves as the tellers of stories. Seeing my students react so enthusiastically to the play also inspired me as their teacher. It gave me ideas about how to lead our unit on Theater of the Oppressed and what topics would be of interest to students. I look forward to how students who saw the performance will be able to use what they learned to bring their own experiences and ideas into the limelight to share important topics with others.” </i></p>

Power Street ensemble tackles what it means to be a minority, what it means to be a community, and just how deeply our words and actions can affect those around us. When the local university begins buying up houses in an integrated black and latino community, residents are pushed out, and the very fabric of the community is ripped apart. <i>MinorityLand</i> attracted to North Philly more than 500 people through its 2 weeks run.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The<i> SHINKA</i> Project started in 2013 to explore the theme of evolution. It evolved into a 20 minute trio piece in 2015. Then in 2016, it became an ensemble 60 minute piece. Finally, we can share this project with the world! </p>
<p>This is my passion project, and I have been working with several different wonderful performers to develop it over the past 4 years.  </p>
<p>Evolution of SHINKA: </p>

<p>This is an original story that I have been choreographing in order to communicate with the world. We are evolving every single moment. We may not see it physically, but mentally, we are evolving all the time. That was the starting point for me. Then I thought of the history of humans, the history of earth- the history of living beings. When I see what is going on in the world today, I believe it is a reflection of our minds- then what if-- what if we can change our minds? The world we see might be different. We might be able to create a society for our children, grandchildren and future generations, where we would want to live - We can transform. These ideas have been evolving in me for the past 4 years. I have been learning, performing, teaching, and creating for years now, and I have found amazing collaborators who can share our common passion. And I feel now I am so lucky that I have people who can create something together- share a vision together. This project is my love letter, and is our prayer to you- our dear friends, family, co-workers, our loved ones- and all living beings on this planet. After 4 years of exploration, I applied to the Capital Fringe Festival, and we received the opportunity to premiere this work in Washington DC!! And I found my team! I am so thankful to the people who are on board with me to go on this journey together.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I do believe this type of show and story needs to be told more. It may be a small single action in the beginning, but one stone creates a ripple and it will get bigger if we keep doing something. We all can do something. And your contribution is a huge part of our action!  Your love, your energy, your prayer is in that contribution, and we carry that into our show! So we do super appreciate your love and support! </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We will do 5 shows plus tech in 3 days. And this is a Butoh &amp; dance &amp; physical theatre show where we put ourselves 120% into every single show to transform. We all will be challenged physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. This is our prayer. </p>
<p>We will perform at Elstad Auditorium – Gallaudet University,  and we are making the piece is accessible and inclusive of  the non-hearing community by using American Sign Language. None of us have not done that, and this is our challenging!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Karlan Judd. I moved to NYC 10 years ago to pursue my dream of becoming a writer of Broadway shows! I've had lots of ups and downs, but the highlight of my time here was when I was given the Richard Rodgers Award for Musical Theatre by Stephen Sondheim. </p>
<p>I was inspired to write The Real Actors of NYC by Nicholas Barnes, Jacob McKenna and Jennifer Anderson, three actors in NYC. As I listened at our dinner dates to their stories about being an actor in NYC, I decided to write a show that would give them what they wanted, the chance to star in a Broadway show! </p>
<p>We have received generous donations in order to put this show up in an Off Broadway Theatre for a six week run. We are most of the way there, but we need your help to raise the remaining $15,000 so this production can happen.</p>
<p>The budget for the show goes primarily to actor, director and designer salaries, sets, props, insurance and advertising. We are working with Actors Equity and the Stage Directors and Choreographers Society Unions and meeting all of their minimum requirements. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I have been working to become a musical theatre writer for 20 years. I always have to choose the topic for my shows carefully, as it is a huge commitment to write a full length musical. I usually end up writing a show about an underdog - someone who's story needs to be told but isn't. That's the case with <i>The Real Actors of NYC</i>. Here are three mega-talented actors, but they just aren't finding the jobs that will help them build their careers.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Mounting an Off Broadway show is always a gamble. Investors are always wary of whether or not they will get their money back. Truth is, the majority of Broadway and Off Broadway shows don't make their money back. However, when they do, they do VERY WELL! Just look at Wicked! With your donations, we will be able to lessen the risk to investors, and create a financial model that will give them some assurity that their investment in our show is a good one! </p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
My name is Karlan Judd. I moved to NYC 10 years ago to pursue my dream of becoming a writer of Broadway shows! I've had lots of ups and downs, but the highlight of my time here was when I was given the Richard Rodgers Award for Musical Theatre by Stephen Sondheim. 
I was inspired to write The Real Actors of NYC by Nicholas Barnes, Jacob McKenna and Jennifer Anderson, three actors in NYC. As I listened at our dinner dates to their stories about being an actor in NYC, I decided to write a show that would give them what they wanted, the chance to star in a Broadway show! 
We have received generous donations in order to put this show up in an Off Broadway Theatre for a six week run. We are most of the way there, but we need your help to raise the remaining $15,000 so this production can happen.
The budget for the show goes primarily to actor, director and designer salaries, sets, props, insurance and advertising. We are working with Actors Equity and the Stage Directors and Choreographers Society Unions and meeting all of their minimum requirements.

Our story is not set in London or in any specific time period, but rather explores the general dynamics of rigid order, society, conformity, and the anarchy inherent to the communities we all know. In this, we are leaning into the feeling of the concept album: broad sweeps of plot, emotional storytelling, and using musicality to illustrate changes in time, identity, and place.</div><div><b><br/></b></div><div><b>Where Your Money Will Go!:</b></div><div>

<li>Set: Our set designer is one of the most talented and creative designers Northwestern has seen in years. His designs are ambitious and creative and will challenge everyone as they come to life. His set will be our first introduction into Tommy's world</li>
<li>Costumes: One of the most crucial parts of any character is their costume. This helps build their identity and give the audience more of an insight into who they are and what their role in the world is. </li>
<li>Props: From items as small as a pen to as large as a pinball machine, the props are the finest of details that round out our world. They are what make a room into Tommy's room. They are what make a stage into Tommy's stage. </li>
<li>Lights: Lights are one of the most crucial parts to any show. They set the mood, highlight the subtle, and dazzle an audience wherever they go. A great set needs great lights to highlight all of its magic. </li>
<li>Projections: Tommy seeks to push the boundaries on what Northwestern productions can do and will be experimenting with projections for the show.

This is an invitation to invest in a project that shines a light on what a lived experience of ALS can look and feel like: beautiful, scary, wild, loving, painful, awesome, sensual, slow, deep, heavy, and changing every day. BLOOM is a dance of transformation that is made possible by the love and support of the people in our communities. We are asking you to join us in making this possible.HOW CAN I HELP?Every dollar given helps connect the dots between Lindsay, her story, her vision, and its reach. There are rewards at every level that are designed to foster this connectivity. For $5 you can subscribe to email updates that document the show as it unfolds. For $25 you can receive a custom made medicine bag filled with ephemera from the show. For $50 you can receive a DVD of the first two performance of BLOOM with handmade artwork by Lindsay. Exclusive Packages offering a whole suite of rewards connecting you to the show start at $150 and include audio and video recordings from the show, original artwork by Lindsay, a limited edition letterpress book of Lindsay's poetry, original photographic prints, and much more! Support in the form of helping us spread the word about BLOOM is just as important as each and every financial contribution to the production. Every single person that this show reaches is one more point of connection bringing Lindsay, BLOOM, and its audience closer together in the fullest possible realization of this work. Help us connect BLOOM with the world by sharing this campaign on social media and email using the links on this page. Follow us on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Tumblr, and share your support with your networks as BLOOM digs deep and reaches far to share this work with the world.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>The History Of Moving Arts</h3>
<p>Founded by Lee Wochner and Julie Briggs in 1992, Moving Arts has been producing and premiering original and inspired plays for two decades. For the 20th Anniversary Season - 20/20 Vision, Sara Wagner, the company's current Artistic Producer, choose to remount Wochner's The Size of Pike, originally produced in the same theater in 1994. While performing in various other venues over the years, Moving Arts has always held onto the intimate space on Hyperion. However, the attached seating has restricted the ability to alter the staging or set-up of this precious little black box. By contributing to this campaign you can help restore and transform the quality of Moving Arts' home base for years to come.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Here is exactly what your contribution will do for us and what you will get in return:</p>
<p>Our Goal of $3,000.00 will buy comfy new seats and collapsable risers, that can be placed in any configuration needed for any production. Funds raised will also go towards the painting of the risers and a gorgeous new sign outside out theater.</p>
<p>We have all kinds of goodies to express our gratitude. You can get Can Coolers, T-shirts, get your ticket in advance for the show, have your name engraved one of the few chairs that will be a part of this theater for years to come, or maybe even get to have your beautiful face used onstage during The Size Of Pike!</p>
<p>A contribution of any amount is appreciated, adored and as always, tax-deductible.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This campaign will not only enhance the immersive experience of Moving Arts' production of The Size Of Pike, but will open up possibilities and improve the quality of our space on Hyperion for the next 20 years. </p>
<p>Moving Arts is one of the longest running non-profit theaters in LA. It's a warm, welcoming place for actors, writers, directors and producers alike to create adventurous new theater. Your contribution will allow us to continue to evolve and accommodate even more work.</p>

<h3>Hello...</h3>
<p>   Thank you so much for visiting my IndieGoGo fundraising page! My name is Vivian MirAnn, and I'm a burlesque performer from Albuquerque, New Mexico. I've been involved in burlesque as a solo performer since 2009, and have had the honor to perform at festivals and events across the United States and Canada. In late 2010, I formed the Gilded Cage Burlesk &amp; Varieté, a performers guild of burlesque artists, aerialists, fire performers, belly dancers, Vaudevillians and circus/sideshow artists of all stripes. We have since become a troupe, hosting shows five times per year as well as producing ""ABurlyQ! Burlesque &amp; Sideshow Spectaculár!"", a weekend-long event held every summer. While many groups across the country focus strictly on burlesque, our troupe recreates historically accurate shows featuring burlesque alongside the Vaudeville and circus-style acts as seen at the turn of the last century.</p>
<p>   The fundraising campaign that I have created will help fund my travels across North America over the winter of 2013. This tour is important both for myself and for the Gilded Cage troupe, as well as New Mexico's burgeoning burlesque scene, as it helps to raise awareness of the existence of our alternative performance art community here in the Southwest. Many people in the country are unaware that there is a thriving burlesque and Vaudeville community here, but we aim to change that! Burlesque and sideshow are uniquely American forms of theatrical art, and the goal of Gilded Cage Burlesk &amp; Varieté and our supporters is to see these art forms thrive again, reaching new audiences that are unaware of the medium's resurgence and importance in American history. In addition, travel forges new contacts for members of the community at large. We bring many performers from across the continent to our home venue, and this tour is sure to expand our talent pool from which to create exciting new shows for our audiences.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>On the road again...</h3>
<p>   In the past, I have paid for all travel expenses on my own either from my paychecks or from show payouts. Requesting financial help is new to me, but in order to meet the goals of our troupe and continue to expand our community, help is needed to offset gas and hotel expenses. The money raised from this campaign will go strictly to travel expenses. Anything left over from the tour, including payouts and tips, will go toward the Gilded Cage performer fund with the express purpose of paying performers to travel to New Mexico and expand our community.</p>
<p>   In exchange for contributions to this campaign, I'll be offering several perks based on contribution amounts. Most of these items will only be available on IndieGoGo, and won't be found anywhere else! Just select your contribution amount, tell me what you'd like to receive from the list, and I'll send it to you!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Why should you help?</h3>
<p>   This isn't just about performances, it's about people. The folks involved in burlesque and Vaudeville work hard to create a visceral experience for audience members. The medium does not exclude based on appearance, physical features, weight, gender or creed. It's a loving community that accepts performers for the unique individuals that they are. Our troupe works to expound on these tenets, providing a safe, welcoming environment for people to explore their creativity free from negativity. Your contributions will help spread the word of our existence. Since I began traveling out on my own, our network has grown by leaps and bounds, making our events the largest and most-inclusive in New Mexico. But there's still many more miles to go...</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Can't donate?</h3>
<p>   It's a tough economy out there, and we know it! Please feel free to help in smaller ways...sharing this fundraiser with friends and fans of the theater will surely help! IndieGoGo has tools to help share, and word-of-mouth can do miracles!</p>
<p>  Thank you so much for your time, consideration, and assistance. It means the world to me and the gang of the Gilded Cage!</p>

<h3>OUR PROJECT AND US</h3>
<p><em>Lord Blackberry's Apocalypse</em> is the story of a delightfully demented owner of a puppet factory in Los Angeles who imprisons his workers inside the factory to save them from the impending apocalypse. Caitlin Bower's psychosexual puppet play explores the ways in which we deceive ourselves in order to survive the tragedies of reality. </p>
<p>Bower, a graduate of UCLA's School of Theater, Film, and Television where she studied acting and directing, is now making her playwriting debut with the Illyrian Players.</p>
<p>Who are the Illyrian Players? Why would she pick us? The Illyrian Players are a rising LA theater ensemble committed to:</p>
<p>unveiling the relevance of classics,  </p>
<p>creating a haven for artists  and opportunities for women in the theatre,  </p>
<p>promoting a message of sex-positivity and tolerance, </p>
<p> and reclaiming the power of theatre  as a subversive art form  with which to change the world!</p>
<p>PLUS: past productions have been given sterling reviews with ""GO!"" ratings from the LAWEEKLY!! (we produce great work)</p>
<h3>WHY WE'RE FUNDRAISING</h3>
<p>Bower has been putting money away for a long, long while but theater is always more expensive to produce than originaly conceived and thus we are asking you for help! Our goal of $1500 will cover the rent of the theater, the construction of the puppets (marionets, hand puppets, and full body puppets!!), costumes, props and whatever is left over will go to our fringe campaign!</p>
<p>The Illyrian Players believe whole heartedly in bringing GREAT THEATER TO EVERYONE at recession proof prices. The more we can raise the richer the experience. </p>
<h3>ALL MONEY DONATED GOES DIRECTLY TO THE PRODUCTION!!!</h3>
<p>We are truly inspired by Lord Blackberry's Apocalypse and are dedicated to bringing it to full fruition regardless of the fact that no one is getting paid. Your money goes where it counts: to the play. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you love the arts but are in a bind and can not contribute NEVER FEAR! There is more than one way to trim an impecable Blackberry beard: get the word out about our production! Let your lovers, friends, family, coworkers, frenimies (and hey! even your enemies) know about our production and its needs!</p>
<p>We thank you so much for your time and consideration! You rock :)</p>

</div><p><span>Hello!</span></p><p>I’m Rebecca Lazier, a Canadian-born choreographer based in Brooklyn, New York.  </p><p>After 20 years of creating and producing dances here and abroad, I am excited to announce that my newest dance, <i>There Might Be Others</i>, will be presented at <b><a href=""http://www.newyorklivearts.org/event/rebecca_lazier_there_might_be_others"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">New York Live Arts</a></b> March 16-19, 2016!</p><p>It is a great honor to be included in <b>NYLA’</b>s 2016 season. <i>There Might Be Others</i> is my most ambitious project to date and features over <b>25 amazing collaborators from four countries: 15 dancers and 10 percussionists.</b></p><p>I hope you will collaborate with us as a backer of this project.  We need to raise <b>$13,000</b> to support the stellar cast artists and help pay for production costs.  Any donation will make a difference and all are fully tax-deductible.  </p><p><b>The Story:</b></p><p>This project began in 2014 with a self created challenge to develop a choreographic adaptation of composer Terry Riley’s <i>In C</i>.  I found this prompt compelling because I have long been interested in open works, emergent forms, and collaborating with performers as co-authors.  Slowly the project grew in scope and took on a life of its own.  Last year I travelled with members of the New York cast to develop the piece through residencies with local dancers in Canada, Turkey, and Poland.  We were able to secure funding to invite performers from each country to be part of the NYLA premiere. I am excited to explore ways the size and diversity of the cast will allow the performance to reflect our global society and contribute to broader conversations about culture and the world at large. </p><br/><p><b>My amazing team:</b></p><p><b>Music Collaborators: </b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">This summer I began collaborating with composer </span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><a href=""http://www.manyarrowsmusic.com%20"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dan Trueman</a> </b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">to develop the music score.  He is creating the piece with the inimitable ensembles  </span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><a href=""http://sopercussion.com%20"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sō Percussion</a> </b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">and </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><a href=""http://www.mobiuspercussion.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-weight: bold;"">Mobius Percussion</a>, in addition e</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">ach performance will feature guest percussionists to form a wild and robust sound.  This summer we were all in residence at</span><a href=""http://sopercussion.com%20"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> Sō Percussion</a><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">’s Summer Institute at Princeton University.  It was fantastic to fill the studio with all of the performers and dozens of </span>instruments<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> and develop a score together.

</div></div>","Hello!I’m Rebecca Lazier, a Canadian-born choreographer based in Brooklyn, New York.  After 20 years of creating and producing dances here and abroad, I am excited to announce that my newest dance, There Might Be Others, will be presented at New York Live Arts March 16-19, 2016!It is a great honor to be included in NYLA’s 2016 season. There Might Be Others is my most ambitious project to date and features over 25 amazing collaborators from four countries: 15 dancers and 10 percussionists.I hope you will collaborate with us as a backer of this project.  We need to raise $13,000 to support the stellar cast artists and help pay for production costs.  Any donation will make a difference and all are fully tax-deductible.  The Story:This project began in 2014 with a self created challenge to develop a choreographic adaptation of composer Terry Riley’s In C.  I found this prompt compelling because I have long been interested in open works, emergent forms, and collaborating with performers as co-authors.  Slowly the project grew in scope and took on a life of its own.  Last year I travelled with members of the New York cast to develop the piece through residencies with local dancers in Canada, Turkey, and Poland.  We were able to secure funding to invite performers from each country to be part of the NYLA premiere. I am excited to explore ways the size and diversity of the cast will allow the performance to reflect our global society and contribute to broader conversations about culture and the world at large. My amazing team:Music Collaborators: This summer I began collaborating with composer Dan Trueman to develop the music score.  He is creating the piece with the inimitable ensembles  Sō Percussion and Mobius Percussion, in addition each performance will feature guest percussionists to form a wild and robust sound.  This summer we were all in residence at Sō Percussion’s Summer Institute at Princeton University.  It was fantastic to fill the studio with all of the performers and dozens of instruments and develop a score together. Watching the musicians and dancers become equal participants in the creation of the work was electric.   Dance Collaborators:  The New York cast is an extraordinary mix of artists: Natalie Green, Simon Courchel, Christopher Ralph, Raja Kelly, Saul Ulerio, Asli Bulbul, Cori Kresge, and Anna Schon!  Turkish collaborators include Tan Temel, the artistic director of TORK Dance and professor of dance at Yildiz Technic University. The Canadian collaborators, Sara Coffin and Rhonda Baker,  are members of Mocean Dance, a Nova Scotia based repertory company dedicated to improvisational forms. The Polish participants, Pawel Sakowicz, Agnieszka Kryst, Ramona Nagabczynska, and Jan Lorys, have presented work independently in Poland, Europe, and New York.Designers: I am thrilled to be collaborating again with Mary Jo Mecca for the costume design and Davison Scandrett for lighting and visual design.  They are the superb team that designed Coming Together/Attica.The Ask: We have secured several grants but we still need funds to bring this work to life. It is a big vision. To give you an idea of how your contributions will be put to work, consider that: $20 pays for rehearsal space for one hour, $100 pays for the truck to move instruments to and from rehearsal, $160 pays for 8 dancers to rehearse for one hour, $900 pays for one five-hour rehearsal with 8 dancers in a studio with musicians for 5 hours. When we achieve our goal of $13,000 we will have raised enough to pay for 50 hours of rehearsal for everyone.  With so many different expenses, we simply cannot do this without you. Creating this piece has taken us to the far reaches of Turkey and northern Poland and to the forests of Nova Scotia and the sweltering summer studios at Princeton. My favorite moments have been savoring the laughter and joy that arises from building a community of collaborative, interdisciplinary artists.  I am overwhelmed with gratitude for the people who are coming together to make this project a reality. When we previewed the piece in Poland in June a critic said “The performers, who masterfully employ both technique and rhythm in a whimsical and energetic way, created a one-of-the-kind masterwork.”I hope we can share it with you.Tickets are available here.

With love and gratitude,Rebecca

<p></p> <p>Helen Newman and Stephanie Glickman have spent many years in the creation of Developing Daisy, <em>a musical in 3 acts with 15 original songs. DAISY is</em> a lesbian love story set in the present, with lengthy flashbacks into the 1970’s, reflecting all that decade’s passion, idealism, politics and drama.</p>
<p><i style=""font-weight: bold;"">Meet Daisy Frank... </i>an aging photographer, who, reluctant to participate in a retrospective that will bring back memories from her youth, is being urged on by a young hip assistant, Jamie Lerner.  From radically different perspectives, they relive the spirit and politics of that earlier decade while making transformative discoveries about themselves and each other.  Through their unlikely collaboration, and their journey through the ""great mother-daughter divide"", Daisy comes to terms with the long suppressed pain of her first lesbian love, dispelling the ghosts of her past and embracing her future.</p>
<p>Helen and Stephanie have been working tirelessly to present the first staged reading of the entire play. It will be presented by the <b>Theater for the New City</b> in Manhattan on January 24th and 25th, 2015. With a cast of 10 equity actors and 15 musical numbers, the two performances not only promise to be entertaining and uplifting, but allow you an opportunity to be part of this developmental process.</p>

</div></div>","About Developing Daisy 
THIS CAMPAIGN IS CLOSED.  OUR NEW CAMPAIGN IS TITLED DEVELOPING DAISY IS HERE!  
WE THANK THOSE OF YOU WHO CONTRIBUTED TO THIS CAMPAIGN.  THOSE FUNDS ARE GOING TOWARDS THE STAGED READINGS RESCHEDULED FOR JUNE 20 AND 21ST.  
PLEASE GO TO OUR NEW PAGE.  
NEW LINK: http://igg.me/at/developingdaisyishere
 Helen Newman and Stephanie Glickman have spent many years in the creation of Developing Daisy, a musical in 3 acts with 15 original songs. DAISY is a lesbian love story set in the present, with lengthy flashbacks into the 1970’s, reflecting all that decade’s passion, idealism, politics and drama.
Meet Daisy Frank... an aging photographer, who, reluctant to participate in a retrospective that will bring back memories from her youth, is being urged on by a young hip assistant, Jamie Lerner.  From radically different perspectives, they relive the spirit and politics of that earlier decade while making transformative discoveries about themselves and each other.  Through their unlikely collaboration, and their journey through the ""great mother-daughter divide"", Daisy comes to terms with the long suppressed pain of her first lesbian love, dispelling the ghosts of her past and embracing her future.
Helen and Stephanie have been working tirelessly to present the first staged reading of the entire play. It will be presented by the Theater for the New City in Manhattan on January 24th and 25th, 2015. With a cast of 10 equity actors and 15 musical numbers, the two performances not only promise to be entertaining and uplifting, but allow you an opportunity to be part of this developmental process.

 WE NEED YOUR HELP!
The Theater for the New City is providing us with rehearsal space as well as their largest theater for the two performances.
In order to take advantage of this generous opportunity and to bring this important historical musical to the next step, we need to raise $10,000. The majority of funding will go towards ensuring that we can put on the most professional quality reading possible with a highly experienced director,  music director, and 10 talented actors/singers.  The  funds will also allow us to hire design consultants and technical support.  We hope to bring in producers and backers can take Developing Daisy on to a full production.

Please Note: If you would like your donation to be tax deductible, please visit our website for instructions on how to mail a check.

  


 Why is it important to bring Daisy's story to the stage? 
 Developing Daisy is more than just a musical. Your contribution helps fund something bigger, and here are just a few examples of the benefits of donating to fund this production: 
To keep the memory of this important decade for feminism andLGBTQ rights alive To document some of the radical changes that have occurred in those communuties in the last 40 years To add to the stories already on film and the stage which portray marginalized individuals and relationships

To be entertained!  To enjoy the experience of music, drama, and humor expressing women's love and connections

<div>Black River Dance is a beautiful space in Central Harlem with two spacious dance studios.  Currently, it is primarily being used as a rental space for parties.  The neighborhood and the space itself are begging to become a consistent arts and community space, offering dance classes to children and adults.  Black River Dance Academy (<a href=""http://www.blackriverdanceacademy.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.blackriverdanceacademy.com</a>) now offers ballet, modern, jazz, African, yoga, and fitness classes to teens and adults, dance classes to children ages 4-11 on Saturdays, and a Friday Afternoon Arts Academy for the charter school students who dismiss early on Fridays.  They receive lunch, homework tutoring, and a dance class from 1-5:30pm.  Eventually the venue will also present up and coming artists of all genres in a cabaret style with catered food and wine included in the price of the ticket: ""Picnic at Black River.""  We are interested in outreach among the community, local artists, and educational groups.</div>

<p>I am Jonette Mungo. I am a mother, teacher, actress, and
playwright.  This play, <u>Mirror, Mirror
on the Wall,</u> is an amazing tale of survival, love, and forgiveness. This is a unique story as it is my story.  I call it autobiographical fiction.  I am a country girl.  I am the granddaughter of farmers who grew up
cultivating an acre garden from which my uncles, aunts and grandparents all
gathered.  It was a humble life but it
was by no means poor.  I am not your cliché
and neither is this story.  The main
character in this story is Aurhora.  She
had it all growing up and still her life was no fairytale.  She lost her virginity to rape, her self-esteem
before that had been destroyed from family and she entered young adulthood as a
broken person.  That brokenness caused
her to spiral into out of control abusive relationships that almost end her
life.  She sees her life as a cruel joke
that God plays on her and she can’t seem to get it right.  But in the end-there is the constant. Herself.
No matter what- it is Aurhora who must decide, change, or continue on living this
way.</p>
<p>The uniqueness of this show is also
in how the story is told.  <u>Mirror,
Mirror on the Wall</u> is told through monologue, dialogue, spoken word, dance,
video re-enactments, original song and multiple character portrayal both on
stage and on screen.  There is no other
one-woman show that has delicately and craftily combined so many storytelling
mediums to effectively reach its audience. 
This show does that!</p>
<p>It has taken me four years to write and re-write this
show.  The women and men I shared its
content with encouraged me to finish it. 
They could all see a piece of themselves or someone they knew in what
Aurhora’s story is.  They all wanted to
see and know how it would end as if Aurhora’s story could help them figure out
how to get out of the darkness and onto a better path.  That is why this show must take the
stage.  Your help is needed to reach,
teach, and help women and men come through the rough places and find their
place of peace.  Afterall, what is good
theatre if it doesn’t make you feel something? Good theatre impacts its
audience.  <u>Mirror, Mirror on the Wall</u>
is good theatre!</p>
<p>The Crispus Attucks Theatre is the birthplace of this
show.  This theatre was first home to
local black performers who had nowhere else to share their talents and
gifts.  It is still giving life to new
artists and children of all walks of life. 
This theatre is one of the oldest historically black theatres in the
country.  Since its renovation and
restoration in 2005 it is yet to establish ongoing seasons of shows.  That is what gave rise to the writer’s
workshop.  To develop new writers so the
Attucks Theatre Stage can once again be alive with new artists and new
works.  <u>Mirror, Mirror on the Wall</u>
is the show to establish the inaugural season of shows at this magical place.</p>

About the Piece
In the summer of ’91 (1891 that is) Johan Nagel
comes upon a small Norwegian coastal town. The town enchants him, and he elects
to spend the summer there. He falls madly in love with Dagny, a woman whose
fiancé is currently stationed far away. Despite the protestations and warnings
of others, Nagel falls in deep with Dagny’s seductive social circle. Little
does he know that Dagny is not unaccustomed to breaking hearts and his new
friends might not have his best interests in mind.
This new musical is
currently having its first developmental workshop at Standard Toykraft in
Williamsburg, Brooklyn. The workshop runs September 6th-12th,
culminating in an invited rehearsal on the evening of the 12th to
share the week’s work with collaborators, supporters, and curious community
members.

Why We Need Your Support
Writing a new musical
is solitary work and we are excited to have the opportunity to explore the
piece in collaboration with real bodies and voices in the room. We’ve reached
the point in our process where it is no longer useful to murmur in living rooms
and endlessly email---it’s time to get the piece into a space where it can
breathe.
While this workshop
doesn’t require fancy costumes or other production elements, it does
require a few main costs:
*Rehearsal Space*
Finding a space to
rehearse an amplified electro-pop musical for a reasonable rate in New York is
challenging. We are lucky to be working in Standard Toykraft’s beautiful
Williamsburg space for the entirety of our workshop with ample space to sing,
dance, and explore.
*Sound Equipment*
Since we are at the
point in our process where a keyboard just won’t cut it we do have to use
microphones, amps, and a sound system in order to really explore this musical’s
unique electro-pop score.
*Artist Compensation*
We are very fortunate
to have an outstanding croup of innovative young artists working on this piece.

Music and Lyrics by Jeremiah Ginsberg and Book by Wendy Ross Ginsberg and Jeremiah Ginsberg.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>For over 2 years, Jeremiah &amp; Wendy Ginsberg have been pouring all their creative juices into writing this new operetta (their 4th musical), and now they have been invited to produce the show at Maranatha Church in Paramus, NJ. The first public performances of “Esther, Sweet Esther” in Concert are scheduled for August 16, 17 &amp; 18, 2013. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>This will be an outstanding theatrical event! Admission is Free! All are welcome! The producers desire that as many people as possible be given the opportunity to experience this great end-time work as it makes its way to Broadway.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The Ginsbergs were invited to present 2 arias from “Esther, Sweet Esther” at The Presidential Inaugural Prayer Breakfast in Washington, DC on January 21, 2013. The cast received a standing ovation with thunderous applause!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Rabbi Jonathan Cahn, the keynote speaker at the Prayer Breakfast, wrote: “Congratulations on your success at the Inaugural Prayer Breakfast. The rendition of the two songs from ‘Esther, Sweet Esther’ was wonderful!”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The authors pray that this musical will bring hope and joy in the midst of the prevailing climate of prejudice towards the Jewish people, the nation of Israel, and the Christians who have come under persecution throughout the world today.</div>
<div> </div>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
The budget is broken down into 2 phases. For Phase 1, we need money to buy airline tickets to fly the team into NJ from all over the country. Airfare will cost approximately $3,825.00. The second most important budget item in Phase 1 is the cost of 7 hotel rooms for 6 nights: $4,956.00. The third item is the pre-pay cost of renting a 12-passenger van at Newark Airport: $889.00. These items must be paid for as soon as possible before the rates go up by double or triple!</div>
<h3>History</h3>
<div>
<p>The Ginsbergs are pioneers in the creation of award-winning Biblical musicals. They wrote and produced “Rabboni,” a Messianic Gospel musical on the life of Yeshua, at the off-Broadway Perry Street Theatre in 1985 to rave reviews:</p>
<ul>
<li>""Ebullient Joy!"" - Richard F. Shepard of <em>The New York Times</em> </li>
<li>""An Up-Tempo Captivating Success!"" - <em>The Jewish Telegraphic Agency</em>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The 700 Club brought their camera crew into the theatre and produced a feature story on “Rabboni” which aired in December of 1985.</p>
</div>
<div>The Ginsbergs wrote and produced their second award-winning musical, “Mendel &amp; Moses,” dramatizing the life of Moses and the Exodus from Egypt, in 1997 at The Century City Playhouse in Los Angeles and at The Canon Theatre in Beverly Hills. The critics raved:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>“Charming and Full of Wit &amp; Wisdom!” - Ed Kaufman, <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em>
</li>
<li>""Mendel brings humor and high spirits to the story! Rousing laughs along the way!"" - Don Shirley, <em>The Los Angeles Times</em>
</li>
<li>""Excellent music! With its feet on the ground, its heart in the heavens, and that irrepressible twinkle in its eye, 'Mendel &amp; Moses' is on the side of the angels and good for what ails a sickened society! Critic's Choice!"" - Polly Warfield, <em>Drama-Logue</em><em><br/></em>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>They wrote and produced a third musical, “The Time of Mendel’s Trouble,” about the end-times and the Two Witnesses in the Book of Revelation, in 2008 off-Broadway at The Beckett Theatre.
<ul>
<li>""Music and lyrics are clever. And when it's funny, it's very funny!"" - Laurie Lawson, <em>The Electronic Link Journey</em>
</li>
</ul>
