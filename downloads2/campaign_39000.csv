These two young adventurers set out to visit each province and territory from coast (east) - to coast (west) - to coast (north) across Canada, to learn about many breathtaking and unique waterways, rich with a myriad of history, landscapes and people.This book is specifically written for children up to 11 years old (up to grade 6) to learn about water through a fictional story featuring real Canadian waterways and facts. This is a story about curiosity, a desire to learn more, a connection with nature and water, and a deep respect for cultures and traditions. Who is behind this storybook? Canada’s Great Water Adventure is being brought to you by Waterlution and was written by four of its very dedicated Youth Advisory Board volunteers- Dorothy Graham, Ellen Stitt, Jill Pelkey and Stephanie Woodworth. These youth volunteers were inspired by amazing children from across Canada who participated in the Great Waters Challenge (hence the name - Canada’s Great Water Adventure!)What is the Great Waters Challenge? The Great Waters Challenge is an interactive and gamified educational program, launched in 2016, and designed to immerse children and youth in water education throughout Canada, through a series of fun challenges that get them out into their watershed! From Vancouver, to Gjoa Haven, to Charlottetown and all communities in between, students and youth learned the names of the Indigenous territories on which they live, explored the history of water in their community, connected through workshops and webinars, and showcased their discoveries with us in various ways (including through blog posts, photos and videos!). Check out the interactive map here What’s so special about Canada’s Great Water Adventure children’s book? It’s packed with cool features!Interactive! All the beautiful illustrations are artfully created by a young emerging artist, who drew on her imagination and knowledge of this vast and diverse country to bring this story to life! She left a few illustrations for the imagination of our little readers to colour, and feel part of the story and book!Ageless! Though this book is specifically written for grades 1-6 to learn about the great water bodies of Canada, we guarantee there’s something in it for you to learn too!35 pages! (+glossary) Of imagination-triggering adventure and exploration across waterways, learning about local traditions and different water practices in Canada!Real facts for deeper learning! Canada’s Great Water Adventure is a fictional story filled with real Canadian waterways and facts, including references to indigenous language and traditions all designed to deepen care and learning around Canada’s great waters.Waterless! Though it is filled with water stories, the book itself is printed through a waterless printing company (most print shops use a ton of water for printing! See more below**). It makes perfect sense to raise awareness about water consumption while being an environmentally-conscious gift.Glossary! With the focus on educating children on water, the glossary at the back highlights new and unfamiliar terms.Bilingual! This book is available in both English and French!Our goal with this fundraising campaign is to share this educational story with as many young learners as possible, to inspire them to connect with water, and to care for its future! Join us in making this possible!  How will the funds be used? Our first goal in this campaign is to distribute 400 books. To achieve this goal, we need to raise $10,000 to cover the cost of production, printing and distribution. One of the reward categories also allows contributors of the campaign to support this book in reaching libraries, schools and families in need.Anything above our initial goal will go directly towards offering school-based workshops through the Great Waters Challenge - the program that inspired this book and campaign - in classrooms across the country!Ready to support Canada’s Great Water Adventure?Thank you for supporting this campaign!

If you’d like this book before Christmas, please place your order by December 13th at midnight (Eastern Standard Time)! We have gone to print. All those who place orders by the deadline will receive a campaign update by December 14 regarding the status of the shipment.With your support we trust we will achieve our campaign goal, and all books will be shipped by mid-January.We want to thank all those who helped us in the process of writing this book, including those who helped cross-check cultural references. Thank you to those who contributed.**Note on waterless printing: Yes, it costs more, but it is the right - and environmentally conscious - thing to do. Many large presses can consume hundreds of thousands of litres of water per year as part of the normal printing process. Waterless printing takes advantage of modern technology to reduce these environmental impacts. It eliminates chemicals and water altogether. Waterless presses are also praised for their high-quality colour reproduction and the reduced paper set-up waste for each job. Ordering multiple books for a Canadian library?

<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We submitted a 31 page letter of comment to the JRP detailing our technical arguments.  NG responded to this letter.</span><br/>

</li>
</ul><p></p><p>We have also been featured in numerous radio and print interviews.</p><h4>Our Concerns</h4><p>We have numerous concerns about the tanker aspects of the Northern Gateway, but they can be roughly summarized by the following three main arguments:</p><p></p><ol>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The estimated risks are too high and this project enjoys a substantial ‘risk premium’ that the public is underwriting.  In other words, why would this project be allowed to proceed when the stated risks are far higher than what is considered acceptable for other large projects, like bridges, for example?</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The consequences of dilbit spills and the possibility of cleanup are unknown.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">It is unclear who is ultimately responsible for the costs of cleanup in the event of a tanker spill. For large spills it will probably be the people of Canada.</span><br/>
</li>
</ol><p></p><p>Each of these arguments is supported by considerable testimony from a variety of expert panels convened during the Joint Review Panel hearings.  It is this testimony and evidence that we feel needs to be made more accessible to Canadians.</p><p><br/></p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); line-height: 40px; font-size: 36px; font-weight: bold;"">We Need Your Help</span><p>We believe that we need to appeal to Canadians across the country to state that export of natural resources is not bad for Canadians if it is done in a safe manner. Unfortunately the Northern Gateway proposal to ship dilbit through the Port of Kitimat and Douglas Channel does not meet those requirements.</p><p>I am writing to ask you to consider making a donation to support an awareness campaign to bring our message to Canadians.  This campaign will consist of an informative video, a website, a petition, a social media campaign and recruiting of new members.  We anticipate that the costs for this campaign will be in the range of $20,000.  Please give this request for funding assistance your careful thought and consideration. </p><p>Thanks and regards,</p><p>Brian Gunn</p><p><br/></p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); line-height: 40px; font-size: 36px; font-weight: bold;"">Incentives</span><p>To acknowledge your generous support we are offering a number of incredible vacation packages from wilderness resorts in British Columbia.  Experience firsthand the wildlife and supernatural beauty that has made this Province famous around the world.</p><p></p><p><i style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></i></p><p><i style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/220918/files/20131124191628-Incentives.png?1385349388"" src="""" style=""""/></i></p><p></p><p><i style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">(Courtesy of Grizzly Tours and Strathcona Park Lodge)</i></p><p></p><p><br/></p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); line-height: 40px; font-size: 36px; font-weight: bold;"">Our Members</span><h4>Dr. Ricardo O.

Although we have extensive experience in the engineering of large projects like the Northern Gateway, we are unfortunately lacking in experience with modern media.  We are raising $20,000, the majority of which will go towards hiring young people who are experts in videography, animation, web development and social media.  Our goal is to create a more substantive debate about Northern Gateway.  We would like to provide Canadians with access to the facts that have been presented in support of, and in opposition to, this project so that they feel empowered to decide for themselves whether or not they support Northern Gateway.Our StoryDear Backer,In the summer of 2012 I took a trip up to Douglas Channel with another professional engineer.  We spent three weeks in an open-top zodiac touring the proposed tanker routes through which Enbridge’s Northern Gateway project will ship 525,000 barrels of diluted bitumen (dilbit) and 193,000 barrels of natural gas condensate (diluent) every day for 50 years.  We wanted to see firsthand the challenges and risks posed by this project.(Brian Gunn in Port Simpson)I became interested in this type of work as a natural extension of my role in the Wilderness Tourism Association, a group that I helped create in order to build a common voice for the many remote tourism operations in their negotiations with industry and government, particularly in land-use planning.  Oftentimes I have found that this work pits my passion for the environment and sustainable wilderness tourism against my background as an engineer in the bulk materials handling industry.  I understand that the development and export of natural resources is central to Canada’s economic success, and to the future of this country.  I also understand, however, that our environment in its untouched state is a significant natural resource in itself, and that its proper stewardship is just as important to our future.  Northern Gateway marine shippingThis trip left both of us with a lasting impression of the immense challenge of the undertaking.  The proposed route to the open ocean is nearly 300 km (186 miles) long through constrained channels, some of which are less than 1400 m (4600 ft) wide.  This may seem large until you realize that the proposed ships are more than 300 m (1,000 ft) in length and can take several kilometers to slow down or stop.  Furthermore, the route is on the northern BC coast, a place famous for its challenging weather, winds, waves, and heavy fog.(Proposed marine shipping routes - Enbridge Quantitative Risk Analysis)Our actions to dateWe came away from this trip with a deep sense of concern for future generations and felt that we had to contribute to the debate.  Together with five other engineers, we formed the Concerned Professional Engineers group and participated in the National Energy Board’s Joint Review Panel as follows:

We submitted a 31 page letter of comment to the JRP detailing our technical arguments.  NG responded to this letter.


We submitted a letter to APEGBC that was published in the Sept/Oct 2012 issue of their Innovation magazine.


In order to respond back to NG, we were able to join C. J. Peter Associates Engineering, who had been accepted as interveners by the NEB, to question NG’s consultants about their work in the March 2013 JRP hearings in Prince Rupert and the June 2013 JRP Final Argument hearings in Terrace.

We have also been featured in numerous radio and print interviews.Our ConcernsWe have numerous concerns about the tanker aspects of the Northern Gateway, but they can be roughly summarized by the following three main arguments:

The estimated risks are too high and this project enjoys a substantial ‘risk premium’ that the public is underwriting.  In other words, why would this project be allowed to proceed when the stated risks are far higher than what is considered acceptable for other large projects, like bridges, for example?


The consequences of dilbit spills and the possibility of cleanup are unknown.


It is unclear who is ultimately responsible for the costs of cleanup in the event of a tanker spill. For large spills it will probably be the people of Canada.

Each of these arguments is supported by considerable testimony from a variety of expert panels convened during the Joint Review Panel hearings.  It is this testimony and evidence that we feel needs to be made more accessible to Canadians.We Need Your HelpWe believe that we need to appeal to Canadians across the country to state that export of natural resources is not bad for Canadians if it is done in a safe manner. Unfortunately the Northern Gateway proposal to ship dilbit through the Port of Kitimat and Douglas Channel does not meet those requirements.I am writing to ask you to consider making a donation to support an awareness campaign to bring our message to Canadians.  This campaign will consist of an informative video, a website, a petition, a social media campaign and recruiting of new members.  We anticipate that the costs for this campaign will be in the range of $20,000.  Please give this request for funding assistance your careful thought and consideration. Thanks and regards,Brian GunnIncentivesTo acknowledge your generous support we are offering a number of incredible vacation packages from wilderness resorts in British Columbia.  Experience firsthand the wildlife and supernatural beauty that has made this Province famous around the world.(Courtesy of Grizzly Tours and Strathcona Park Lodge)Our MembersDr. Ricardo O.

<h3>Mission</h3>With your help, I hope to join an expedition that proposes to conduct a preliminary archeological survey in the Andes mountains near Cusco, Peru (elevation 16,000-19,000+ft) in the area of our discovery. This project is a timely matter as the region is being actively threatened by mining in sensitive watershed areas that will cause damage to the fragile alpine ecosystem and to a sacred Incan ceremonial complex. By capturing this piece of history we can act to protect both a truly remarkable landscape and an important piece of history, saving it for future generations and educational opportunities.<br/><span><span><br/></span><h3>Impact</h3></span>A multidimensional project, there is a little something for everyone:<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><b>- Archeological Discoveries in Foreign Lands!</b><span><br/></span>Who hasn't dreamed of being Indiana Jones for a day?

<p><b>- Environmental Preservation</b><span><br/></span>The mountains in this region are currently being threatened by new, active mining. In fact, mine prospecting is now occurring only a half mile from the watershed.

</div></div>","Short Summary During ongoing climate and ecological research in the Peruvian Andes, a team of experts have uncovered ancient history, and with it, the means to protect one of the world's natural treasures.


MissionWith your help, I hope to join an expedition that proposes to conduct a preliminary archeological survey in the Andes mountains near Cusco, Peru (elevation 16,000-19,000+ft) in the area of our discovery. This project is a timely matter as the region is being actively threatened by mining in sensitive watershed areas that will cause damage to the fragile alpine ecosystem and to a sacred Incan ceremonial complex. By capturing this piece of history we can act to protect both a truly remarkable landscape and an important piece of history, saving it for future generations and educational opportunities.ImpactA multidimensional project, there is a little something for everyone:- Archeological Discoveries in Foreign Lands!Who hasn't dreamed of being Indiana Jones for a day? Located in the mountains just outside of Cusco, Peru, we will be exploring a newly identified Incan ceremonial complex. This complex is thought to include lost temples, burial grounds, ceremonial sites, artifacts, etc. All sites and finds will be thoroughly documented, including by video, adding to the rich history of the region and our understanding of pre-existing cultures. 

                 
- Environmental PreservationThe mountains in this region are currently being threatened by new, active mining. In fact, mine prospecting is now occurring only a half mile from the watershed. The fragile alpine eco-systems of these areas cannot sustain the practice of mining, and the sensitive watershed may be destroyed if the mining advances. By documenting this incredible history (as outlined above) we will be able to submit this area for historical protection from the mining that so threatens the landscape. Don't let this natural beauty be wasted!
        
- Adventure - Mountaineering, Rock Climbing, Diving, Kayaking and more! Due to the nature of location, all of this work will have to be done at elevations up to ~19,500ft, many parts of which are largely unexplored. Moreover, much of the lost remains are situated under current lakes and our work will be conducted during the Winter season. Using advanced technologies, gear, and highly skilled mountaineers, climbers, divers, and more, we are more than prepared to tackle these conditions head-on. In fact, we have documented success having led scouting trips to the region in several previous years, one of which set a World Record for diving depth at altitude. (2013)



- Biomedical ResearchDue to the extreme nature of these conditions, and unexplored effects of diving at altitude, with our team of physicians and medical researchers we will be able to monitor the physiological effects and responses to such conditions. Additionally, we may continue to explore biological effects at elevation.   What We Need  This expedition is run on volunteers, and in order to join the crew as one of the mountaineers/kayakers and research assistants I need to raise funds to cover the associated costs.- Airfare/cargo to Peru, $1400.00- Local travel (in Peru), $350.00- On site land costs (horses, horse/cargo handlers, food, shelter, etc.), $1850.00- Specialized gear for high altitude, mountain and water expeditions, $750.00- Administrative costs (covers % to Indiegogo, photography, etc.), $850.00Total: $5200.00 
Please keep in mind 100% of my time is volunteered! My credentials: Medical Researcher, Former Wilderness Guide, Photographer

Save the sea turtle is relevant as never before. Thanks to efforts like conservation program in 2009 a total and permanent ban on the use, possession and sale of eggs, and any other product of sea turtle was declared. But the job of keeping them does not end there. Every dollar raised is used directly for the protection and conservation of sea turtles, are constant and needs more care and support can save more turtles.</p><p>Please visit us on the beaches, to learn about our work and participate in a release of sea turtle hatchlings, to experience, to know its beauty and importance in ecosystems, and to understand the urgency of preventing their extinction.</p><p><br/></p><h3>Why Should I Help?</h3><p>Only about 1 in 1000 hatchlings survive their first days of life. Some deaths are from natural causes, but many are caused by humans. Throughout his life embark on journeys of thousands of miles, traveling between countries, oceans and international waters, this makes them one of the few global animal. Are exposed to many hazards, such as fishing nets, poaching and pollution of the seas. Sea turtles have lived on Earth for over 150 million years, but if we do not act soon, may disappear.</p><p><br/></p><h3>Risks and Challenges</h3><p>Currently our greatest challenge is to continue the marine conservation program along the Salvadoran coast turtle. There are many organizations doing similar projects in some beaches but none achieved such a impact nationally and us. We want to go ahead and consolidate these efforts, we know that with the support of many we can make a real impact and allow hawksbill continue visiting the Salvadoran coast.</p><p>Thanks to the support of people like you, and companies that understand the importance of preserving the hawksbill, we achieved overcome many challenges, and we trust you today to continue our hard but rewarding work.</p><p><br/></p><h3>Other ways you can help</h3><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Beside donations, there are other ways to help:</span><br/></p><ul>

somos?</b></h1>
<p>La Fundación Zoológica de El Salvador (FUNZEL), es una
organización no gubernamental sin fines de lucro fundada en 1992. Nuestro
propósito es el de proteger y conservar la fauna silvestre en El Salvador,
desarrollando programas de investigación, rehabilitación de especies, atención
médico-veterinaria, educación ambiental y sensibilización de diversos sectores
de la población con el propósito de evitar el tráfico y tenencia de animales
silvestres como mascotas y/o en cautiverio.</p>
<p>En los últimos años, FUNZEL se ha especializado en la
ejecución de programas y proyectos de conservación de vida silvestre y sus
ecosistemas, enfocando especiales esfuerzos en los recursos costero marino del
país, orientados a la conservación de las 4 especies de tortugas marinas que
anidan en las costas salvadoreñas: Carey (<i>Eretmochelys
imbricata</i>), Golfina (<i>Lepidochelys
olivácea</i>), Baule (<i>Dermochelys
coriácea</i>) y Prieta (<i>Chelonia mydas
agassizii</i>).</p>
<p>FUNZEL trabaja en toda la costa salvadoreña, desde la Playa
El Maculis, La Unión hasta Barra de Santiago, Ahuachapán. Durante la temporada
2012-13, la cobertura alcanzó a 19 corrales con la incubación de 969,372 huevos
de las cuatro especies de tortuga marina y liberando 871,698 crías, lo que
significó el 90% de éxito de eclosión.</p>
<p>El Maculis es una playa que durante la marea baja se puede
encontrar una superficie rocosa expuesta, en las cuales se forman pozas
intermareales, lo cual lo vuelve un hábitat ideal para el desove de tortugas
carey. En los últimos años hemos liberado 2,947 neonatos de carey, teniendo un
éxito de eclosión del 78%. Así mismo, estudios realizados recientemente han
confirmado que el 70% de las tortugas carey del pacifico oriental anidan en la
costa salvadoreña. Debido a esto queremos reforzar nuestros esfuerzos con la
tortuga carey en dicha playa durante esta temporada.</p><p></p><p><b><br/></b></p><h3><b>¿Cómo
operamos?</b></h3>
<p>Se construyen corrales de incubación en distintas playas a
lo largo de la costa salvadoreña. Un staff de biólogos certificados les lleva
capacitación técnica gratuita a las comunidades costeras, en las áreas de
conservación y desarrollo comunitario. Durante la época de anidación, se
reciben los huevos de parte de los recolectores en los corrales, y se les
reconoce económicamente por el trabajo realizado, según la cantidad de huevos
entregados a los viveristas, y de acuerdo a las normas y disposiciones de las
autoridades de medio ambiente, esto con el objetivo de reemplazar el
tradicional modelo de comercialización de huevos de tortuga para consumo
humano, el cual históricamente significaba una fuente de ingresos para los recolectores
y sus familias.</p><p></p><h3><b><br/></b></h3><h3><b>¿Que necesitamos?</b></h3><p></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">A pesar de las ventajas que supone trabajar en conjunto con
las comunidades costeras, siempre hay necesidades vitales para el éxito de los
corrales de incubación en cada temporada de anidación y liberación. Para la

Our purpose is to protect and conserve wildlife in El Salvador, developing research programs, rehabilitation of species, veterinary medical care, environmental education and awareness of various sectors of the population in order to avoid traffic and tenure of wild animals as pets and/or in captivity.FUNZEL has a very wide experience in the field of wildlife conservation, it is the only NGO focused on the conservation of species and also with the great contribution of including veterinary medicine as a biology tool for conservation. As such, FUNZEL has made efforts to conserve birds, mammals, amphibians and reptiles.In recent years, FUNZEL has specialized in the implementation of programs and projects for the conservation of wildlife and their ecosystems, focusing special efforts on coastal marine resources of the country for the conservation of the 4 species of sea turtles that nest on the Salvadoran coast: The hawksbill sea turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata), The olive Ridley sea turtle (Lepidochelys olivacea), The leatherback sea turtle (Dermochelys coriacea) and the green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas agassizzi). The Maculis is a beach at low tide you can find exposed rock surface, where tide pools form, which makes it an ideal spawning habitat for hawksbill turtles. In recent years we have released 2,947 hawksbill hatchlings taking a hatching success of 78%. Also, studies have recently confirmed that 70% of the eastern Pacific hawksbill turtles nest on the Salvadoran coast. Because of this we want to strengthen our efforts in that hawksbill beach this season.How do we operate?Hatcheries were built at different beaches along the Salvadoran coast. A staff of certified biologists leads them free technical training to coastal communities in the areas of conservation and community development. During the nesting season, eggs from collectors in the pens are received, and are recognized for their work economically, as the number of eggs supplied to the growers, and according to the rules and regulations of the authorities environment, this in order to replace the traditional marketing model of turtle eggs for human consumption, which historically meant a source of income for collectors and their families.What do we need?Despite the advantages of working together with coastal communities, there is always vital needs for the success of hatcheries in each nesting season and liberation. For the 2014 season is no exception, so we need the following resources:Material for the construction and maintenance of hatcheries.Fuel for transport construction material, technical personnel, veterinary staff and equipment, and volunteers.Maintenance of vehicles of the foundation.Money to pay for the eggs collected by collectors of communities.Payment of salary for a nursery-man, who is responsible for receiving, planting and care of hawksbill nests in the hatchery, as well as keep track of them.What will you get?By helping us you can choose any of the following perks,""De carey somos todos"".Save a hawksbill hatchling one by one. With your donation of USD$25 you will receive a special thank you by email and we will release a hatchling in your name.""Yo soy de playa y
ellas también"".Because only one is not enough for you, and you want to give a gift to the sea. With your donation of USD$50 you will receive a special thank by email, a virtual certificate, and we will release six hatchlings in your name.""El club de amigos de las tortugas marinas""Because you feel so attached to sea turtles that they are like your family. With your donation of USD$100 you become part of FUNZEL´s friends club, and you'll receive: a membership card, special thanks by email, a virtual certificate and we will release 12 hatchlings in your name, or you can participate in a public release (transportation not included).""Tortuga carey, la joya del mar""Because for you hawksbills are so beautiful and valuable as a jewels of the ocean. With your donation of USD$500 you become part of FUNZEL´s friends club and you'll receive: a membership card, special thanks by email, a virtual and printed certificate, a T-shirt with turtle design, we will name and release a hatchling nest in your name (we will send photos), and/or you can participate with your family and friends in a private release (transportation from San Salvador included).""¡Yo, el mar, soy vida!""Because your love for sea turtles is so deep and infinite as the ocean itself. With your donation of USD$1000 you become part of FUNZEL's club of friends and will receive: a membership card, a special thanks video from our team, a FUNZEL kit that includes: two T-shirt for adults and two for childs, two turtle stickers and two turtle buttons. We will name and release a hatchling nest in your name (we will send photos), and/or you can participate with your family and friends in a private release (transportation from San Salvador included).Note: Virtual releases are with hawksbills, if you choose to assist and participate in a release, these will be with olive ridley or green turtles, depending on availability, on a beach of you choice where a hatchery is working.e.
ImpactIn the past 3 years we have managed to achieve a change in attitude unprecedented not only in coastal communities but also in the general population. Save the sea turtle is relevant as never before. Thanks to efforts like conservation program in 2009 a total and permanent ban on the use, possession and sale of eggs, and any other product of sea turtle was declared. But the job of keeping them does not end there. Every dollar raised is used directly for the protection and conservation of sea turtles, are constant and needs more care and support can save more turtles.Please visit us on the beaches, to learn about our work and participate in a release of sea turtle hatchlings, to experience, to know its beauty and importance in ecosystems, and to understand the urgency of preventing their extinction.Why Should I Help?Only about 1 in 1000 hatchlings survive their first days of life. Some deaths are from natural causes, but many are caused by humans. Throughout his life embark on journeys of thousands of miles, traveling between countries, oceans and international waters, this makes them one of the few global animal. Are exposed to many hazards, such as fishing nets, poaching and pollution of the seas. Sea turtles have lived on Earth for over 150 million years, but if we do not act soon, may disappear.Risks and ChallengesCurrently our greatest challenge is to continue the marine conservation program along the Salvadoran coast turtle. There are many organizations doing similar projects in some beaches but none achieved such a impact nationally and us. We want to go ahead and consolidate these efforts, we know that with the support of many we can make a real impact and allow hawksbill continue visiting the Salvadoran coast.Thanks to the support of people like you, and companies that understand the importance of preserving the hawksbill, we achieved overcome many challenges, and we trust you today to continue our hard but rewarding work.Other ways you can helpBeside donations, there are other ways to help:

_______________________________________¿Quiénes
somos?
La Fundación Zoológica de El Salvador (FUNZEL), es una
organización no gubernamental sin fines de lucro fundada en 1992. Nuestro
propósito es el de proteger y conservar la fauna silvestre en El Salvador,
desarrollando programas de investigación, rehabilitación de especies, atención
médico-veterinaria, educación ambiental y sensibilización de diversos sectores
de la población con el propósito de evitar el tráfico y tenencia de animales
silvestres como mascotas y/o en cautiverio.
En los últimos años, FUNZEL se ha especializado en la
ejecución de programas y proyectos de conservación de vida silvestre y sus
ecosistemas, enfocando especiales esfuerzos en los recursos costero marino del
país, orientados a la conservación de las 4 especies de tortugas marinas que
anidan en las costas salvadoreñas: Carey (Eretmochelys
imbricata), Golfina (Lepidochelys
olivácea), Baule (Dermochelys
coriácea) y Prieta (Chelonia mydas
agassizii).
FUNZEL trabaja en toda la costa salvadoreña, desde la Playa
El Maculis, La Unión hasta Barra de Santiago, Ahuachapán. Durante la temporada
2012-13, la cobertura alcanzó a 19 corrales con la incubación de 969,372 huevos
de las cuatro especies de tortuga marina y liberando 871,698 crías, lo que
significó el 90% de éxito de eclosión.
El Maculis es una playa que durante la marea baja se puede
encontrar una superficie rocosa expuesta, en las cuales se forman pozas
intermareales, lo cual lo vuelve un hábitat ideal para el desove de tortugas
carey. En los últimos años hemos liberado 2,947 neonatos de carey, teniendo un
éxito de eclosión del 78%. Así mismo, estudios realizados recientemente han
confirmado que el 70% de las tortugas carey del pacifico oriental anidan en la
costa salvadoreña. Debido a esto queremos reforzar nuestros esfuerzos con la
tortuga carey en dicha playa durante esta temporada.¿Cómo
operamos?
Se construyen corrales de incubación en distintas playas a
lo largo de la costa salvadoreña. Un staff de biólogos certificados les lleva
capacitación técnica gratuita a las comunidades costeras, en las áreas de
conservación y desarrollo comunitario. Durante la época de anidación, se
reciben los huevos de parte de los recolectores en los corrales, y se les
reconoce económicamente por el trabajo realizado, según la cantidad de huevos
entregados a los viveristas, y de acuerdo a las normas y disposiciones de las
autoridades de medio ambiente, esto con el objetivo de reemplazar el
tradicional modelo de comercialización de huevos de tortuga para consumo
humano, el cual históricamente significaba una fuente de ingresos para los recolectores
y sus familias.¿Que necesitamos?A pesar de las ventajas que supone trabajar en conjunto con
las comunidades costeras, siempre hay necesidades vitales para el éxito de los
corrales de incubación en cada temporada de anidación y liberación. Para la
temporada 2014 no es la excepción, por lo cual necesitamos los recursos
siguientes:


Material para la construcción y mantenimiento
del corral de incubación.


Combustible para transporte del material de
construcción, personal técnico; personal y equipo veterinario; y voluntarios.


Mantenimiento de los vehículos de la fundación.


Dinero para la remuneración por los huevos
recolectados por los recolectores de las comunidades.

Pago del sueldo para un viverista, quien es el
encargado de la recepción, siembra y cuidados de los nidos de carey en el
corral, así como de llevar un registro de los mismos.

<p class=""idea-title""><strong>Was bieten wir unseren Crowdfunding-Unterstützern als Dankeschön für ihre finanzielle Unterstützung an?</strong></p>
<p class=""idea-content"">Da viele hochrangige Wirtschaftsexperten der Meinung sind, dass sich mit dem „Bioboom“ auch das sozialverantwortliche Unternehmertum stark entwickeln wird, sehen wir gerade jetzt die große Chance, uns in diesem Marktsegment zu etablieren. Unser Ziel wäre eine Kooperation/Allianz bestehend aus Lieferanten, Erzeugern, Händlern, Organisationen/Verbänden, Gästen bzw. Kunden und Medien zu erschaffen, aus welcher win-win Situationen entstehen. Der immaterielle Konsum steigert das persönliche Glück mehr als der materielle. Deshalb steht in unserem Konzept die Erhöhung der Lebensqualität und die Förderung der ressourcenschonenden „Konsumartikel“ wie Kultur, Kunst, Naturerleben, Persönlichkeitsbildung usw. im Mittelpunkt. Die direkte Investition und Mitbestimmung der Lieferanten, Händler und der Bürger (welche im Konzept näher beschrieben werden) dient nicht der Profitmaximierung, sondern der direkten Erhöhung der Lebensqualität der Bürger und der Region. Durch den effektiv-nachhaltigen Einsatz von Sachkapital, Naturkapital, Humankapital, Sozialkapital und Finanzkapital versuchen wir einen ständigen Strom an Gütern und Leistungen zu erbringen, die zum Wohlbefinden der Bürger beitragen. So entsteht ein soziales Wachstum, welches nicht auf Kosten des Natur- und Sozialkapitals entsteht. Im Gegenteil, Human- und Sozialkapital werden ausgebaut und Naturkapital wird erhalten. Diese Art des Wirtschaftens gibt dem Sach- und Finanzkapital eine vollkommen neue Rolle und Wirkung.</p>

Was möchten wir tun?
Mit dem Aufbau eines Restaurants via Internet, durch die User und dem Fach-Personal, unter Berücksichtigung sozialer und ökologischer Aspekte, wollen wir die Demokratisierung der Wirtschaft, die Erhöhung der gemeinsamen Lebensqualität und die Lösung gesellschaftlicher Probleme erreichen.
Welches Problem lösen wir damit?
Wir präsentieren auf einer Internet-Seite das Grundkonzept eines sozial-ökologischen Restaurant. Jeder Interessierte kann dann dort, bis zu einem festgelegten Termin, seine Ideen und Wünsche in Bezug der Einrichtung, Dienstleistungen, Lage, Speisen, Getränke usw. loswerden. Für ein Sponsorengeld (welches ein Teil des Kapitals des Restaurants werden wird) von 10 bis 50€, kann dann nun jeder „Mitunternehmer“ mit abstimmen. Bei dieser Abstimmung wird auch festgelegt, wie viel des Gewinns des Restaurants, in welches soziale oder ökologische Projekt fließt. Die Ideen und Kreativität der User entscheiden wie erfolgreich das Unternehmen werden kann und sie sind gleichzeitig an der Lösung sozialer und ökologischer Probleme mit beteiligt. Dieses Projekt stellt die Demokratisierung der Wirtschaft, unter Berücksichtigung sozialer und ökologischer Aspekte, via Internet dar. Ziel ist es in möglichst vielen Gemeinden Restaurants aufzubauen.
Welche Vorteile vor anderen Produkten/Dienstleistungen/Projekten bringt unser Konzept? Was ist der USP?
Vorteile unseres Unternehmens:-aus der Sicht der Arbeitenden: die Sicherheit der Beschäftigten die egalitäre Einkommensverteilung die Teilhabe am Eigentum des Produktivvermögens die gleichberechtigte Teilnahme an den betrieblichen Entscheidungen der kooperative, demokratische, freundschaftlich Geist untereinander die Einbettung in die Lebensräume-aus der Sicht der Planung: die weitsichtige und zukunftsorientierte Politik des Genossenschaftsrats die hohe Produktivität die Dynamik die Transparenz die effektive Kontrolle aller Arbeitsbereiche durch die Werktätigen und „Aktionäre“die straffe Entscheidungsstruktur des Betriebs und ihrer Vernetzung-aus der Sicht der Kunden und Verbraucher: die entsprechend ihrem gebrauchszielfachlich, ökologisch bzw. biologisch hohe Qualität das gute Gefühl, dass das ausgegebene Geld nicht nur einer Elite zu Gute kommt, sondern unter den Arbeitenden gerecht aufgeteilt wird, um dann wieder in den Wirtschaftskreislauf zurückzukehren und so eine gemeinsame hohe Lebensqualität der Gesellschaft zu gewährleisten das soziale Engagement des Betriebs Ein weiterer Kundennutzen besteht darin, dass wir den Bürgern über das Restaurant, eine Möglichkeit einräumen aktiv in das Wirtschaftsleben und in die Gestaltung ihre Region einzuwirken.

Der Landwirt erhält:


Eine Gemeinschaft: Planungssicherheit und die Möglichkeit der Unterstützung


Ein gesichertes Einkommen: Möglichkeit eines planbaren Einkommens und sich daher einer gesunden Form der Landwirtschaft widmen können


Freude an der Arbeit: Zu wissen für wen die Lebensmittel bestimmt sind


Der Hof:


ist geschützt vor Schwankungen des Marktes


ist geschützt vor schädlicher landwirtschaftlicher Praxis


Die Region:


wird durch die Vielfalt in der Landwirtschaft ein Ort mit höherer Lebensqualität


wird gestärkt durch das Zusammenbringen von Menschen, die gesunde Bedenken über unsere Zukunft teilen


erfährt einen ökonomischen Wandel, da die Wertschöpfung verstärkt in der Region bleibt

<h2><strong><em>What's awesome about Oroeco?</em></strong></h2>
<p>Hi Indiegogoers! Welcome to <a href=""http://oroeco.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Oroeco</a>, the app that tracks how your personal values link to your everyday life, then rewards you for improving upon the things you care about most. </p>
<p>What exactly do we mean by that? Well, we're building a system that automatically links your spending and investment transactions to scientific data that calculates the impacts of each decision. You'll be able to see how your personal impacts compare to your neighbors, as well as your Facebook friends, and even (we hope) celebrities. AND (even better), you'll be able to compete to improve vs. yourself and your friends, get personalized tips, and earn ""oro"" points to cash in for both virtual and real world prizes.</p>
<p>We're aiming to empower you with information to sort out big choices from small. We think you deserve to get rewarded when you put your money where your heart is, and the more information and incentives you have for making better choices, the more companies will be encouraged to make more sustainable products (since they won't get your money if they don't).</p>
<p><img alt=""oroeco = your $ + your $'s impacts + tips, games &amp; rewards"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://oroeco.com/assets/external/1_oroeco_overview.png"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;""/></p>

<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<h2><strong><em>Oroeco 1.0 &amp; OPTIMUM</em></strong></h2>
<p>What we're launching through Indiegogo is our first web app. This app will automatically track your spending and investments (initially through <a href=""http://mint.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Mint.com</a>), then add social and environmental impacts, starting with greenhouse gas emissions. So our first app will essentially be a fun, social, real-time carbon calculator that shows how all aspects of your life impact global climate change. Then you'll get rewarded for helping us refine your figures, reducing your impacts, and sharing and competing with friends. </p>
<p>All <a href=""http://oroeco.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Oroeco</a> users will get the ability to track their spending impacts for <strong><em>free. </em></strong>Oroeco OPTIMUM subscribers will also be able to track the impacts of their investments.

<h2><strong><em>Our Master Plan (and why we need your $$$)</em></strong></h2>
<p>Climate change is just the first of many personal value-related impacts that we plan to eventually let you track through Oroeco. We're also looking at some great databases that will link your spending and investments to a bunch of other important social, environmental, and personal health indicators (like living wages, forced labor, local sourcing, water quality, air pollution, biodiversity, health impacts related to your diet and exercise habits, and the influence of corporate money in politics).</p>
<p>We're focusing on climate change because we have to start somewhere, and it's an important issue our team is passionate about. We also already have all the climate data we need to make a very cool proof-of-concept product. </p>
<p>So what we've got now is <a href=""http://oroeco.com/team"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">a solid team of scientists and engineers</a> who have already linked up a spending data feed from <a href=""http://mint.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Mint.com</a> to climate change data. And we just added Facebook friend comparisons, along with personalized improvement tips. </p>
<p>What we're lacking is the ability to pay a user-interface (UI) designer to make our app fun, intuitive, and utterly gorgeous. What you see above are just mockups to give a sense of the functionality we're initially going for, so please don't hold the clunkiness of the current design against us! Our current alpha product has most of this functionality illustrated above, but we're planning to substantially improve the aesthetics and UI before our 1.0 launch (we just need $$ to do it). </p>
<p>We'd also like to raise enough funding for a mobile design specialist who can turn our web app into a sexy little portable package (initially HTML5, then native iOS, Android, and Windows Mobile). There are also server hosting fees we'll need to cover as we grow, and plenty of other development costs that have been piling up.</p>
<p>So that's why we're reaching out to all y'all Indiegogoers to help turn our Master Plan into reality. We're fully ""bootstrapping"" at the moment, so all our costs have been coming out of our own (quite limited) pockets. We're hoping to far exceed our $15k goal, but that's the minimum amount we need to launch our first version of Oroeco. The more money we can raise, the more resources we'll have to add in other environmental, social and health impact indicators, and the more useful (and fun!) Oroeco will become.</p>

<h2><strong><em>What you get out of the deal</em></strong></h2>
<p>All of our Backers who pledge $5 or more get access to our private beta. So you'll get to start using Oroeco before we launch it to the public, and you'll also have the opportunity to tell us how to improve our functionality and design to suit your needs and aesthetic sensibilities.</p>
<p>Those of you who pledge more will get access to Oroeco OPTIMUM, which tracks impacts from your investments, as well as your spending decisions (see above for more info on Oroeco 1.0 vs. Oroeco OPTIMUM). We'll be launching Oroeco OPTIMUM as a paid subscription service, so our Backers will get a discount (that varies based on how much you pledge).</p>

<p><em><a href=""http://www.oroeco.com/team"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">A few of the faces bringing Oroeco to life. [click for more info]</a></em></p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<h2><strong><em>Our Story (as told by Ian)</em></strong></h2>
<p>The idea for Oroeco started brewing slowly, and it's grown through hundreds of conversations, personal experiences, and technical experimentation. </p>
<p>I've been working around the globe for much of the past decade. From Asia and Africa, to Latin America, Europe and all over the US, I've gotten a chance to poke my head into many of the complex supply chains that make up our global economy. I've seen plenty of companies exploiting workers and the environment. But I've also seen a growing number of companies that take corporate responsibility quite seriously, spurred on by both aware consumers and internal champions for change.</p>
<p>The piece that's still missing though, is better information transfer, particularly information that makes it all the way from raw materials production and manufacturing to individual shoppers and investors (i.e. <em>all of us</em>). While many companies have realized it can pay to be ""green,"" many just go far enough to get a label (organic, fair trade, etc) then blow the rest of their budgets on marketing. Governments can force companies into better practices, but politics and conflicts of interest keep much from happening, and globalization makes it easy to sweep unsightly images under someone else's rug.</p>
<p>Seeing this made me wonder whether the best way to drive a real, systemic shift towards sustainability would be to create a system that empowers all of us with better information and incentives. The easiest way to do this is to track the impacts of how we spend and invest our money, since many of the things we care about (both big and small) are ultimately driven by the collective power of our wallets.</p>
<p><img alt=""oroeco = your $ + your $'s impacts + tips, games &amp; rewards"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://oroeco.com/assets/external/oroeco_lifecycle.png"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;""/></p>
<p><em>Oroeco estimates full ""life cycle"" impacts of products and services.</em></p>
<p>Around the same time these thoughts were bubbling to the surface, I started doing research on environmental <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-cycle_assessment"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">life cycle assessment</a>, a scientific method for evaluating net impacts. This research made me realize that there are already huge databases that calculate the impacts of our choices, from how we get to work and power our homes, to what we eat for lunch. The problem has been that this data sits tucked away in the nooks and crannies of academia, industry, and high-priced consultants. Even when data is publicly available, it's generally not packaged in a way that's relatable, and it's certainly not automatically linked to our decisions in a way that's engaging.</p>
<p>The idea for Oroeco really clicked when I realized we can now combine life cycle data with smart phones, online banking (via <a href=""http://mint.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Mint.com</a>, and similar sites), social networks, and gaming mechanics to create a service that's informative, rewarding, and (most importantly) FUN! </p>
<p>So ""Oroeco"" (""oro"" for gold, ""eco"" for both ecology and economics) was born in the spring of 2011, and I set off on a quest to round up teammates. First was my friend David, a Stanford physicist and journalist who had <a href=""http://rideforclimate.com/blog/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">just biked 21,000 miles around the Americas researching and talking about climate change</a>. A few months later I reconnected with Kirstin, another college friend with a passion for personal sustainability, and the tech skills to turn ideas into actual app development.</p>
<p>Yang enthusiastically joined our crew last winter, adding more app developer mojo and life cycle assessment experience to the team (from her research at MIT and UC Berkeley). Then Yang roped in her friend Dav, a Berkeley+MIT guru of behavioral psychology, climate informatics, and database programming, who's PhD research is a perfect fit for what we're building.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.oroeco.com/team"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Team Oroeco</a> has now evolved from a network of friends into the first version of a product we hope takes the world by storm. We're mostly scientists and engineers, with some artists and (do-gooder) lawyers tossed in for good measure. We are all passionate about this project, and we're convinced we've got the technical skills to pull it off. Now we just need your help to fund us along the way!</p>
<p><img alt=""oroeco = your $ + your $'s impacts + tips, games &amp; rewards"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://oroeco.com/assets/external/oroeco_world.png"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;""/></p>

<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<h2>
<strong><em>you + Oroeco + your friends = a better world                   </em></strong><strong><em>(cheesy, but we're convinced it's true)</em></strong>
</h2>
<p>We've got all the data and tech we need to breathe life into Oroeco. The more money we raise, the better our first version of Oroeco will be. But even more fabulous is the fact that each one of you who pledges your support is demonstrating that you care about the impacts of your everyday decisions, and that you're willing to help create a system that makes these impacts more transparent.</p>
<p>Once we launch Oroeco 1.0, our biggest challenge will be finding and engaging users. Ultimately, Oroeco's positive influence on the planet will depend on 1) the number of users we have, and 2) the amount our users use Oroeco to inform their decisions. Thus, we'll constantly be looking for ways to improve our user experience, beautify our UI, create more enticing rewards, and spread the word far and wide. We hope you and our other first users from Indiegogo will play a large role in all these endeavors. The more you encourage your friends to use Oroeco, the more our impacts will scale, and the more leverage we'll have for shaping the world we really want to live in.</p>

What's awesome about Oroeco?
Hi Indiegogoers! Welcome to Oroeco, the app that tracks how your personal values link to your everyday life, then rewards you for improving upon the things you care about most. 
What exactly do we mean by that? Well, we're building a system that automatically links your spending and investment transactions to scientific data that calculates the impacts of each decision. You'll be able to see how your personal impacts compare to your neighbors, as well as your Facebook friends, and even (we hope) celebrities. AND (even better), you'll be able to compete to improve vs. yourself and your friends, get personalized tips, and earn ""oro"" points to cash in for both virtual and real world prizes.
We're aiming to empower you with information to sort out big choices from small. We think you deserve to get rewarded when you put your money where your heart is, and the more information and incentives you have for making better choices, the more companies will be encouraged to make more sustainable products (since they won't get your money if they don't).

oroeco = your $ + your $'s impacts + tips, games, & rewards

Our Master Plan (and why we need your $$$)
Climate change is just the first of many personal value-related impacts that we plan to eventually let you track through Oroeco.

We're focusing on climate change because we have to start somewhere, and it's an important issue our team is passionate about. We also already have all the climate data we need to make a very cool proof-of-concept product. 
So what we've got now is a solid team of scientists and engineers who have already linked up a spending data feed from Mint.com to climate change data. And we just added Facebook friend comparisons, along with personalized improvement tips. 
What we're lacking is the ability to pay a user-interface (UI) designer to make our app fun, intuitive, and utterly gorgeous. What you see above are just mockups to give a sense of the functionality we're initially going for, so please don't hold the clunkiness of the current design against us! Our current alpha product has most of this functionality illustrated above, but we're planning to substantially improve the aesthetics and UI before our 1.0 launch (we just need $$ to do it). 
We'd also like to raise enough funding for a mobile design specialist who can turn our web app into a sexy little portable package (initially HTML5, then native iOS, Android, and Windows Mobile). There are also server hosting fees we'll need to cover as we grow, and plenty of other development costs that have been piling up.
So that's why we're reaching out to all y'all Indiegogoers to help turn our Master Plan into reality. We're fully ""bootstrapping"" at the moment, so all our costs have been coming out of our own (quite limited) pockets. We're hoping to far exceed our $15k goal, but that's the minimum amount we need to launch our first version of Oroeco. The more money we can raise, the more resources we'll have to add in other environmental, social and health impact indicators, and the more useful (and fun!) Oroeco will become.

<h3></h3>El Camino Real de los Tejas means “the royal road of the Tejas Indians.”  Historically the road connected Mexico City to Los Adaes, the first capital of Texas.  This allowed Spanish influence to spread into the province.  The road also allowed Anglo settlers to head west into Texas in the 1800s, and was a major artery of trade and culture.  The trail created the cultural diversity of Texas that we know today. <br/><br/>El Camino Real is composed of many famous sites and segments.  These include places such as <a href=""http://www.thealamo.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the Alamo</a> and the <a href=""http://www.nps.gov/saan/index.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">San Antonio Missions</a>, <a href=""http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/state-parks/mission-tejas"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mission Tejas</a> and <a href=""http://www.visitcaddomounds.com/index.aspx?page=2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Caddo Mounds</a>, and <a href=""http://www.crt.state.la.us/parks/ilosadaes.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Los Adaes</a>.<br/><br/><p>On October 18, 2004, El Camino Real de los Tejas was

<div>We feel this campaign is incredibly important because there is so much at stake.

<div>Northfield Area Community Solar (NACS) is currently in the process of creating a solar garden to provide Northfield residents the opportunity to access solar energy to power their homes! In order to participate in the community solar garden, residents must purchase a ""leaf"" (a subscription to the solar garden). However, this can be difficult to afford for many households and families. To make solar energy accessible to all, the Community Action Center of Northfield (CAC) is teaming up with students to create a campaign to provide low income housing complexes in Northfield access to solar energy!</div> <p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p><b></b></p>
<p><b>Where your money is going:</b></p>
<p>Your donations will go directly to the CAC. The CAC will then use this money to purchase as many leaves as possible for meters attached to low income housing complexes. The CAC will then use the money saved to subsidize heating expenses equally throughout the low income housing complexes because the CAC actively subsidizes for heating expenses for all of the complexes but only pays for electricity for a select few residents. In the end, this campaign functions as a means to support the community and promote solar energy locally, while also making renewable energy accessible to parts of the community that would not otherwise have the ability to purchase a subscription. </p>
<p><b>Why $930?</b></p>
<p>We need to raise approximately $930 to afford one leaf subscription. Each leaf costs $889, but IndieGoGo requires a portion of the money. If we are able to raise enough money for multiple, then the CAC will purchase as many leaves as possible. If the donations do not add up to a full leaf subscription, the CAC will use a portion of their own budget to afford an additional leaf. </p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>

This campaign is a crowd funding effort to rally outdoor and environmental communities to support the future of this incredible national scenic trail. Federal funds for land preservation and trail maintenance are drying up due to sequestration and federal spending cuts. Improving the quality of the Arizona Trail, protecting its corridor, and taking the necessary steps to ensure its long-term preservation is not a priority of state or federal decision makers. We know it’s important to those who use and love the trail. Funds from this campaign will directly support: 

trail maintenance and protection 

repairing segments of trail damaged by wildfire and erosion 

installation of steel gates that keep motorized vehicles off the trail 

map printing and distribution 
Working together we can sustain the AZT for future generations.What is the Arizona National Scenic Trail?The Arizona Trail is an 800+ mile recreation trail from Mexico to Utah that connects mountain ranges, canyons, deserts, forests, wilderness areas, historic sites, trail systems, points of interest, communities, and people. It serves dayhikers, backpackers, equestrians, mountain bicyclists, trail runners, nature enthusiasts, cross-country skiers, snowshoers, and mule and llama packers. The Arizona Trail Association's mission is to build, maintain, promote, protect and sustain the Arizona Trail as a unique encounter with the land.  The Arizona Trail Trek is an interactive thru-hike from March 14th to May 31st with 14 Gateway Community events, selected hikes and backpacking trips highlighting the best the trail has to offer, and on-the-trail updates as Sirena hikes up the state.Who is Sirena Dufault?Sirena is the Gateway Community Liaison for the Arizona Trail Association and an avid hiker/backpacker.  In 2007 she began volunteering with the ATA, helping to build many miles of trail near Tucson. In 2008-2009 she section-hiked the Arizona Trail to raise awareness of Fibromyalgia, a chronic pain condition she has had since 1997.  The adventure kindled a passion for the trail and the wild lands of Arizona.  She became the Trail Steward for Passage 16c, responsible for maintaining 5.5 miles of trail along the Gila River.  Now, as the Gateway Community Liason, she has cultivated a relationship between trail users and the 33 Gateway Communities along the trail while promoting area tourism to stimulate local economies.  Learn more about Sirena and follow her adventure on the AZT through her blog at: http://desertsirena.wordpress.com/.Urgency to Support the ATA
In 2011 we celebrated the completion of the 800+ miles of trail from Mexico to Utah, but there is still a lot of work to do.  
120 miles of trail need reconstruction to meet the standards of a National Scenic Trail, including moving the tread away from roads and creating a more sustainable trail. 
Many gates and crossings require upgrading to better accommodate equestrians.The ATA needs funds to protect the corridor in the face of land management changes such as mining projects, utility development and exploratory natural gas drilling. The cost of routine trail maintenance by professional trail crews (who do the work volunteers cannot) is $150,000 annually. The Forest Service budget is shrinking dramatically, and this is impacting how the AZT is managed and supported by our federal agency partner. The ATA is the leading organization in the building, maintenance, protection and promotion of the Arizona Trail. The ATA works hard to protect the trail in ways federal agencies can’t to ensure the trail experience won’t be compromised and the AZT will be here for future generations.

<h2><b>The Story:</b></h2>
<div>We're a group of residents living in Norfolk, VA who are affected by coal dust from Norfolk Southern's (NS) Lambert's Point coal export facility. We're mothers, fathers, sisters, daughters, sons, brothers, grandmas and grandpas and everything in between.  We've been campaigning <b>for over a year</b> to get NS to take <b>simple, common-sense </b>measures to stop their toxic coal dust from blowing into our neighborhoods: enclose the dumpers and the conveyances to the ships and cover the coal cars. These are commonplace practices in similar facilities, but <b>NS, a Fortune 500 giant</b>, refuses to act on the 1973 recommendation of their own consultant and resident complaints made over many years. They have even spread misinformation about the issue in local media and have publicly proclaimed that their coal dust is harmless, contrary to documented links to respiratory and heart diseases and premature death. We have met with and asked NS directly to take the requested mitigation measures. Also, over 500 people signed a petition asking the Norfolk City Council for a resolution to the same effect. The Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) granted NS an exemption to the Clean Air Act 50 years ago and refuses to take any regulatory action, despite the threat to public and environmental health. The <b>Norfolk City Council refuses to act on the resolution. </b>
</div>
<div><b>We can't stand by while NS continues to dump 90,000 or more pounds of coal dust into our neighborhoods each year.  </b></div>
<h2><b><br/></b></h2><h2><b>The Goal:</b></h2>
<div>This fundraising campaign is to raise money for print, online, and billboard advertising. This would enable us to recruit more people into the campaign and put more public pressure on NS. </div>

The Story:
We're a group of residents living in Norfolk, VA who are affected by coal dust from Norfolk Southern's (NS) Lambert's Point coal export facility. We're mothers, fathers, sisters, daughters, sons, brothers, grandmas and grandpas and everything in between.  We've been campaigning for over a year to get NS to take simple, common-sense measures to stop their toxic coal dust from blowing into our neighborhoods: enclose the dumpers and the conveyances to the ships and cover the coal cars. These are commonplace practices in similar facilities, but NS, a Fortune 500 giant, refuses to act on the 1973 recommendation of their own consultant and resident complaints made over many years. They have even spread misinformation about the issue in local media and have publicly proclaimed that their coal dust is harmless, contrary to documented links to respiratory and heart diseases and premature death. We have met with and asked NS directly to take the requested mitigation measures. Also, over 500 people signed a petition asking the Norfolk City Council for a resolution to the same effect. The Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) granted NS an exemption to the Clean Air Act 50 years ago and refuses to take any regulatory action, despite the threat to public and environmental health. The Norfolk City Council refuses to act on the resolution. 

We can't stand by while NS continues to dump 90,000 or more pounds of coal dust into our neighborhoods each year.  
The Goal:
This fundraising campaign is to raise money for print, online, and billboard advertising. This would enable us to recruit more people into the campaign and put more public pressure on NS. 

Here is how our fundraising goal breaks down for a 6 month period: 

Facebook/Online Ads: $4,800
VA Pilot Online Ad: $5,000
Radio Ads: $2000
Billboard: $25,000
Total: $36,800

Here is how our perks break down: 

Any donation amount: You'll receive a confirmation email for your donation. We'll also list you on our Facebook Page in a ""Thank You"" post, unless you opt out.

<h3>What's At Stake</h3>
<p>Hawaiian rain forests are globally unique: 90% of our plants and animals are found nowhere else on the planet. For that same reason, the threat to our native ecosystems from invasive species is greater than anywhere else in the world. We need your help to protect our precious forests by ""firing up"" our local fight against one of the worst forest threats, an alien weed called kahili ginger.</p>
<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>On Kohala Mountain, on the north end of Hawaii Island (AKA the ""Big Island""), the Kohala Watershed Partnership (KWP) is working to protect 50,000 acres of tropical rain forest, perpetuate Hawaiian biodiversity, and ensure the water supply for native ecosystems and human populations. Our nine partners represent a diverse coalition of land managers, including 5th-generation ranching families, land trusts from the Hawaiian nobility, as well as conservation organizations and State Natural Area Reserves. This partnership works together to address common threats to the forest of Kohala Mountain. </p>
<h3>What's a Ginger Ninja?</h3>
<p>Here's the story behind our name: A group of local middle school students were volunteering with KWP to control invasive ginger in our forest this year. As you might imagine, it's pretty fun to swing a machete and hack down weeds. However, this group realized that the ""samurai"" approach was probably more destructive to the forest than it needed to be, so they coined the term ""Ginger Ninja"" to describe their stealthy but deadly assault on ginger, one of the most invasive weeds in our forests. The name stuck!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Culprit</h3>
<p>Native Hawaiian forests don't fit typical expectations of tropical rain forests elsewhere in the world; we have no monkeys, mice, panthers, or pythons. Here in Hawaii we have colorful tree snails, carnivorous caterpillars, curvy-beaked honeycreeper birds, and flowering plants of every size and shape. Native species in Hawaii evolved from plants and animals that made their way to our distant shores during the life time of our volcanic islands. Due to our remote location in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, the rate of new species introductions was about one new plant or animal every couple thousand years. In the 21st century, our ecosystems are being flooded with invaders from all parts of the globe, and we now measure the rate of introduction in weeks or months rather than millenia.</p>
<p>Kahili ginger is one of the worst invaders of all. It is a colorful, robust, sweet-scented flowering relative of that yummy stuff we put in stir-fry and cookies. It was originally brought here from northern India 100 years ago as a garden flower, but it spread into our forests, out-competing native species, and changing the flow of water through the ecosystem. It needs to be controlled, or we may lose our unique forests forever.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What's Being Done</h3>
<p>KWP has a field crew of six, built over the years from people who have a passion for our native forests. Our funding comes from private foundations, government grants, and donations. We also have a corps of almost 300 volunteers, who come from all over the island and the world to help us with our work. Students from seven local schools also contribute their enthusiasm, time and sweat to protect Kohala's forests.</p>
<h3>The Plan and The Imperative</h3>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>We are seeking funding through this campaign to accelerate our kahili ginger control efforts. There are more than 50,000 acres of forest that have already been invaded by ginger, and we are a crew of six, spread across the mountain building fences, controlling feral animals, killing weeds, and planting trees. If we are to make a difference in this war on ginger, we need to deploy a team of ginger ninjas, to fight one battle at a time, to whittle away at the invasion, and protect the forest before it's too late.</p>
<p>Our goal is to raise at $20,000, which is half of what we need to win the first battle: to remove the ginger from at least 100 acres of native rain forest.If we raise more, we will do more! We will attack the ginger with our field crew and volunteers, and hire a team of local high school student interns this summer to ramp up the efforts. When we demonstrate the effectiveness of this effort (documented and mapped for everyone to see!), we can scale it up to more battles, in more areas, to protect more forest!</p>

<h3><span style=""color: #1e979e;"">WHERE are the funds going?</span></h3>
<p>Four of us will be on the ground late December into early January for about 12 days. <b>Everyone is volunteering their time and gear for the project</b>, and while an initiative like this would normally price out at $75k, we’re aiming to keep our entire travel and production budget to around $15K. Here’s how it breaks down:</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><b>Flights (long, economy class hauls)</b>: $8k <br/></span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><b>Lodging (sleeping on floors if we have to)</b>: $2k <br/></span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><b>Food &amp; Water (grocery stores, not fancy restaurants)</b>: $2k <br/></span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><b>In-country transportation (interviews are spread across islands)</b>: $2k <br/></span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><b>Insurance &amp; miscellaneous</b>: $1k </span></p>
<p>We have some other projected costs including hiring a translator, specialty shots, and more, but we’re starting with a $15k goal to cover basic expenses (which it really won't, because of the costs we'll incur fulfilling perks!). We’ll of course cover all personal expenses out of our own pockets; <b>every dime raised from this campaign will go 100% into the project or fulfilling perks</b>.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><span style=""color: #1e979e;"">PRE-ORDER TODAY &amp; get perks!</span></h3>
<p>We unconventionally decided that instead of raising private funds we wanted to invite our friends, family, and the broader Indiegogo community to JOIN us on this project.  We’ll be blogging the experience at <a href=""http://www.lastglimpse.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">lastglimpse.org</a>, sharing updates from on the ground and doing what we can to make it feel like YOU'RE THERE  as part of the team. In exchange for your donations, we’ve got some great perks. Check ‘em out, pick what sings to you, and let's go capture a #LastGlimpse!</p>
<hr/>
<h3><span style=""color: #1e979e;"">FAQ</span></h3>
<p><i><b>Are you a non-profit?</b></i><br/>Not yet, but we intend to be. If you’re looking to come in at a high value perk and would like a tax-deductible receipt, email us at lastglimpsedoc (at) gmail. We’re currently working to identify a Fiscal Sponsor.</p>
<p><i><b>How long will the documentary be?</b></i><br/>We’re aiming for a 30-minute piece, but will cut various shorter lengths for as wide distribution as possible. We see the documentary as the cornerstone of a larger movement, and storytelling will be a big part of it.  </p>
<p><i><b>I know someone in the Maldives who can help; who should I contact?</b></i><br/>Fabulous! Please drop us a note at lastglimpsedoc (at) gmail and we’ll get in touch.</p>
<p><i><b>When can I expect to receive my perks?</b></i><br/>We’re expecting to have a final cut of the documentary sometime in March or April. Our backers will be the first to receive it around then, at the same time as t-shirts, postcards, or anything else pre-ordered. We expect our initial screenings will take place at that time.</p>
<p><i><b>What if I buy a ticket to a screening but the date changes?</b></i><br/>If we change the date and you can't make it, upon request we'll send you ""The Doc PLUS"" perk instead; if you ordered a VIP ticket, upon request we'll send you ""The Home Viewing Party"" perk and refund the $24 delta. </p>
<p><i><b>How do I win a free perk by sharing on Facebook or Twitter? </b></i><br/>We'll be watching Facebook &amp; Twitter for people sharing this campaign with the tag ""#LastGlimpse"" --  and when the campaign ends, we'll identify 3 winners for whom we’ll bring back a special something from The Maldives. </p>

The stark reality is that the science says it is going to happen -- and already, groundwater supplies are being polluted and portions of the coastline are eroding away. A national identity, a rich culture, an entire country could potentially be lost at sea.
Let's marvel at modern Atlantis in bittersweet beauty. Join us as we head to The Maldives this December to capture a #LastGlimpse!

WHAT is #LastGlimpse?
Our plan with this travel documentary is to not only show what makes this area so unique, but also raise awareness around the plight of the Maldivian people as the cornerstone of a global action-oriented campaign around climate change.
It's a bold idea to celebrate Maldivian culture, the people, the stories of this island nation before it may very well disappear. Along the way, we’ll introduce you to the restaurateur and her family, the fisherman and his boat, the traditions and the dance – the people whose lives are on the front-lines of climate impact. We seek to highlight each story through a lens of authenticity, as well as through a prism of hopeful futures.

Flights (long, economy class hauls): $8k Lodging (sleeping on floors if we have to): $2k Food & Water (grocery stores, not fancy restaurants): $2k In-country transportation (interviews are spread across islands): $2k Insurance & miscellaneous: $1k 
We have some other projected costs including hiring a translator, specialty shots, and more, but we’re starting with a $15k goal to cover basic expenses (which it really won't, because of the costs we'll incur fulfilling perks!). We’ll of course cover all personal expenses out of our own pockets; every dime raised from this campaign will go 100% into the project or fulfilling perks.

PRE-ORDER TODAY & get perks!
We unconventionally decided that instead of raising private funds we wanted to invite our friends, family, and the broader Indiegogo community to JOIN us on this project.  We’ll be blogging the experience at lastglimpse.org, sharing updates from on the ground and doing what we can to make it feel like YOU'RE THERE  as part of the team. In exchange for your donations, we’ve got some great perks. Check ‘em out, pick what sings to you, and let's go capture a #LastGlimpse!

FAQ
Are you a non-profit?Not yet, but we intend to be. If you’re looking to come in at a high value perk and would like a tax-deductible receipt, email us at lastglimpsedoc (at) gmail. We’re currently working to identify a Fiscal Sponsor.
How long will the documentary be?We’re aiming for a 30-minute piece, but will cut various shorter lengths for as wide distribution as possible. We see the documentary as the cornerstone of a larger movement, and storytelling will be a big part of it.  
I know someone in the Maldives who can help; who should I contact?Fabulous! Please drop us a note at lastglimpsedoc (at) gmail and we’ll get in touch.
When can I expect to receive my perks?We’re expecting to have a final cut of the documentary sometime in March or April. Our backers will be the first to receive it around then, at the same time as t-shirts, postcards, or anything else pre-ordered. We expect our initial screenings will take place at that time.
What if I buy a ticket to a screening but the date changes?If we change the date and you can't make it, upon request we'll send you ""The Doc PLUS"" perk instead; if you ordered a VIP ticket, upon request we'll send you ""The Home Viewing Party"" perk and refund the $24 delta. 
How do I win a free perk by sharing on Facebook or Twitter? We'll be watching Facebook & Twitter for people sharing this campaign with the tag ""#LastGlimpse"" --  and when the campaign ends, we'll identify 3 winners for whom we’ll bring back a special something from The Maldives. 
Share this campaign on Facebook or Twitter (use links up top) with #LastGlimpse for a chance to win free perks. THANK YOU!

<p>My name is Lauren, and I want to bring an educational beehive enclosure and pollination garden to my green neighborhood in Seattle, Washington.</p>
<h3><strong>Why?</strong></h3>
<p>High Point is home to many Somali, Cambodian, and Vietnamese families, and cultivating honey bees is part of our shared heritage.</p>
<p>Being part of the solution is a good thing. Bees are in trouble; we need them, and they need our help.</p>
<p>Pollination – West Seattle has beautiful plants and lush P-Patches– let’s keep them happy and pollinated</p>
<p>Honey to share and enjoy</p>
<p>Increased educational opportunities for kids and adults alike</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Background</strong></h3>
<p>Honey bees pollinate 30% of all the food we eat and 80% of all fruits and vegetables. The global honey bee population has suffered a dramatic decline in recent years. Wild honey bee populations in the US have decreased by 50% over the past 50 years, and bee colonies maintained by beekeepers have decreased by about two thirds. This is due to a variety of reasons - most of them man-made. Without intervention, the continued demise of these incredible pollinators would have a dramatic effect on our ecosystems and food supply.</p>
<p>I had heard about the plight of the honey bee, but I wasn't fully aware of the situation and importance until I saw the film <em>Vanishing of the Bees</em>. I posted my idea on the <a href=""http://westseattleblog.com/2012/05/laurens-idea-saving-bees-through-education-but-she-cant-do-it-alone"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Lauren's Idea on West Seattle Blog"">West Seattle Blog</a> asking how my neighbors felt about installing an educational beehive in a local P-Patch. The response was incredible and truly inspiring! So here we are, after more than a year, with a beautiful space for the bees and a pollination garden, a huge level of community support, local beekeepers to help us out (one has even taken me under her wing as an apprentice), pledged labor and funding from the <a href=""http://www.highpointneighborhood.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""High Point Neighborhood"">High Point Neighborhood</a> Association and Seattle P-Patch for sustained maintenance into the future, and a Department of Neighborhoods grant to get things rolling.</p>
<h2>How you can help</h2>
<p>We've come so far, but <strong>we need your support</strong> for the final push. We've gotten here thanks to the excitement and support of people just like you- friends who offered their time, money, expertise, and dedication. <strong>Will you join us? </strong></p>
<p>Every bit counts towards our goal. A donation of <strong>$5 buys one square foot of mulch</strong> for our garden- <strong>$250 fully outfits a novice beekeeper</strong>.  </p>
<p>So <strong>spread the word</strong>! Donate what you can, and tell friends and family. Best of all, come join us! <a href=""http://www.westseattlebeegarden.com/events.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sign up to volunteer</a> at an upcoming work party, and we'll see you in the garden.</p>

<p><strong>What is the money for?</strong></p>
<p>Thanks to the Seattle Department of Neighborhoods and other contributions, here is what we have:</p>
<p>- Fence for the pollination garden ($3,000 for material and labor)</p>
<p>- Polycarbonate to enable a transparent and secure beehive enclosure ($4,000)</p>
<p>- Remaining materials for the 9' tall beehive enclosure and shed ($3,000)</p>
<p>- Landscaping and grading, etc. ($2,000) - (this includes wood chips, gravel, compost, and plants for gardens, much of this is being donated as well)</p>
<p>- 2 traditional beehives and stands, butterfly house and mason bee structure ($500) - actual cost is $1250, but $750 worth is being donated)</p>
<p>- Equipment rental ($2,000)</p>
<p>- Materials to install a waterline, spigot and sink ($500)</p>

<p>- Colorful educational signs ($5000) </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>How your contributions will be spent:</strong></h3>
<p>- Beekeeping equipment, enough to share ($1,500)</p>
<p>- Food and drinks for volunteers during work parties ($1,000)</p>
<p>- 2 additional beehives with frames from Shipwreck Honey -local hive carpenter ($1000)</p>
<p>- WiFi webcam to place at entrance of hive - would create interactive component for visitors, and research opportunities for local educators ($250)</p>
<p>- Small solar panel for basic power ($500)</p>
<p>- Live demonstration supplies ($500)</p>
<p>- Additional educational signs for demonstrations (would purchase with any additional funding left over)</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>The West Seattle Bee and Pollination Garden will teach visitors, residents and school children about bees and pollination. The beehives will be enclosed inside a primarily transparent enclosure. This enclosure heightens the flight path of the bees, minimizing direct human interaction and protecting curious children from getting too close to the hives. The space will be surrounded by beautiful flowers and trees, illustrating the symbiotic relationship of bees and plants.</p>
<p>Schools will be welcome to take field trips to the hives and see demonstrations with the bees. Visitors will learn about bees and pollinators through posted signs and observing the hives. Our community, families and local groups will be welcome to host meetings in the space. Seattle residents and community members will learn new skills and share experiences by being part of this great project.</p>

Our mission is to make a documentary on the advanced methods and techniques found on the self-sufficient farm of Rio Muchacho in Ecuador. Afterwards, we will distribute our documentary across schools in Quebec so that younger students can learn and acquire the knowledge to do compost and help save our planet. Of course, we will help the owners of the farm by doing various tasks on the farm and working hard!

Matthew Amechi Onyeanula is a Nigerian born (Citizen from Lagos, Nigeria) was educated in Nigeria and Ghana. He is a certified Permaculturist and has had the opportunity to work and volunteer with different organisation in Nigeria and Ghana.


Innocent Kelvin Coffie is a Ghanaian, born and raised in the Volta region. Once a teacher in Akosombo Estern Region he is now a Farm Manager/Permaculturist.

VISION
Our vision is of humanity living in harmony with a functioning ecosystem. Our goal is to establish a regenerative agriculture and permaculture demonstration center within the Kyrehi community of Kintampo South in the Brong Ahafo Region in Ghana.

MISSION

Our earth ecosystem is in shambles. Healthy ecosytems are fundermental to sustainable business and vibrant and social communities; indeed peoples health and well being are intricately linked with the Earths health and well being. These issues need to be addressed. Our Mission is to address this by:
Experimenting with and demonstrating possible solutions to problems faced by poor Kyrehi community farmers such as degraded land, dependency on erratic weather patterns, and lack of resources(capital, education, tools, etc.) 

Increase soil fertility and biodiversity in the broader community landscape , making the land moreproductive for future generations by sharing and spreading techniques and technologies we are currently working with to achieve our mission including the following:Natural building, bee keeping and agro-forestry systems, chickentractors, greenhouses, micro terraces, contour ditches, edible forest gardens, sustainable animal management, rainwater catchment, low cost irrigation systems, intensive gardens, greywater systems, composting, passive solar energy, value added product development, etc. 
What We Need 


We are are looking for all possible support/sponsorship/collaboration from local and foreign organizations wishing to help us combat land degradation, restore and protect the environment, encourage sustainable agriculture, and aid rural inhabitants (common people) in achieving self-reliant and well improved living standards.

We are seeking $20,000 USD to kickstart this project. Funds raised in this campaign will be allocated to the following items in order of Priority:
Registration of Ngo, bank account.: $1000
Land : $7000-10000 USD
Water: Creation of Bore/Well: $5000
Farm Tools/Inputs: $500
Structures: $3500
The Impact

 Poverty is the greatest issue people are facing here (in our region) as almost 70 percent here are living below the poverty line. Many youths have remained unemployed for years and are fast loosing hope of getting out of the grips of poverty. The situation is very critical and needs urgent attention in the form of capacity building and the creation of employment opportunities.
Risks & Challenges
  
One of our greatest challenges is the
socio-economical difficulties that Africa faces. Deforestation and land degradation creates food security issues for many Ghanaians . Often However, the
individuals who would benefit most from what we are teaching are also those who
are least able to afford a permaculture education. We are meeting this
challenge by offering the most affordable education we can. As a non-profit organization, we also intend to minimize
our expenses and reinvest our profits to further improve the accessibility of a
permaculture education.
A potential risk that our project faces is a
downturn in the local and global economy. Ghanaians and internationals alike
are less likely to invest in self-education or consider other techniques in trying times. Ironically, if this happens what we are teaching is even more valuable (i.e.
making home, garden and business more resilient and productive). Thus this risk also comes with great opportunity,
Other Ways You Can Help
  We are also seeking for foreign youths wanting to come for internship as part of their university degrees/ studies or wishing to do volunteer service here inGhana (West Africa) with us for 3, 6 to 12months.  Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about your campaign. Remind them to use the Indiegogo share tools!   And that's all there is to it.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>What
is GreenByBlue?</b></p>
<p>The world is witnessing an economic, social and
environmental crisis. Fortunately, a growing number of people and communities
across the globe are taking action to make the world a more sustainable,
equitable and prosperous place. They are doing so through entrepreneurship,
collaboration and innovation.</p>
<p>GreenByBlue is our one-year long project
investigating the transformational power of green and sustainable initiatives
on people, cities and natural environments around the world. Our focus is on
action and policy, challenges and opportunities. GreenByBlue will meet the
people behind these initiatives, whether they are sustainable businesses, community-based
projects, green start-ups, cleantech companies, renewable energy cooperatives,
green tourism, green design, or ecological projects. </p>
<p>The two-person team will travel around the world
by land and sea (no planes) to visit these initiatives. Travelling this way
ensures that we integrate fully with the communities and environments at every
stage of the journey. It also ensures we minimise our carbon-foot print. Departing
from Amsterdam on 1 May, 2014, our route will take us eastwards through Europe,
Central Asia, China, South East Asia, Australasia, across the Pacific, into
Latin America, North America, across the Atlantic and back to Europe.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p></p>
<p>My name is Joe Bik and I am the Founder &amp; Director of
Voice of Yongos (VOY), a community based organization involved in
reforestation, environment and community development projects in the Yongomugl Sub-District
of Simbu Province, Papua New Guinea.  </p>
<p><b>E</b>verything we do daily like the use of
electricity, use of office equipment, driving a car, travelling in bus or in a
train or in a plane or in a ship we all contribute to emit carbon dioxide (CO2)
into the atmosphere which cause global warming and creates climate change that
brings misery and disastrous destruction to many lives around the globe so we as
global citizens living on this planet we should be responsible for our own
actions. </p>
<p>The simple thing we all need to do now is to plant trees
because the battle against climate change cannot be won without trees; the
potential contribution for re-balancing the carbon equation is to more plant
trees as it will sequester carbon and play a major role in mitigating the
effects of global climate change.</p>
<p>With this understanding, VOY had
initiated a community driven tree planting project in 2012 and had so far raised
and planted 16,519 trees already but the target is to plant 50,000 trees by 2014
so we need donations from generous people, charity groups and corporate
citizens to expand our seedlings production and planting to meet the target. </p>
<p>Planting trees also creates
employment for rural people to support their families and also it provides cash
income to women and children and with this small income they are able to get
basic needs to sustain their livelihoods.</p>
<p>We would like to raise US$5000 to
purchase project materials and here is a small budget (Seeds - $1000.00, Poly
Bags - $1500.00, Shade Cloth - $500.00, NPK Fertilizer - $500.00, Stipend -
$1500.00).</p>
<p>Your donations will help us to increase our production
capacity to raise and plant 50,000 or more trees by 2014 to reduce global carbon
emissions, restoring local ecosystem services, alleviating poverty and sustaining
rural livelihoods of the people. </p>
<p>As a contributor, you are part of the project team and co-own
the trees so we request that you encourage your friends, your family and your
work mates to contribute, participate in tree planting activities and involve
in local environmental awareness education programs in your area. </p>
<p>All contributors will receive certificates, posters, updates
on the project and also we offer special local hand weaving hand bags to first
10 generous people who contribute $100 and local hand weaving cap to first 20
people who contribute $50, these perks will be delivered, three weeks after the
campaign ends. </p>
<p>As a contributor, you can also claim 100% credit for contributing
to the reduction of global carbon emissions and at the same time you should be
proud that you are creating cash income opportunities for local families in
this remote part of the world <b>so become
a partner, make a donation and let us work together to raise and plant more trees
and make earth a cooler place to live. </b></p>

potential contribution for re-balancing the carbon equation is to more plant
trees as it will sequester carbon and play a major role in mitigating the
effects of global climate change.
With this understanding, VOY had
initiated a community driven tree planting project in 2012 and had so far raised
and planted 16,519 trees already but the target is to plant 50,000 trees by 2014
so we need donations from generous people, charity groups and corporate
citizens to expand our seedlings production and planting to meet the target. 
Planting trees also creates
employment for rural people to support their families and also it provides cash
income to women and children and with this small income they are able to get
basic needs to sustain their livelihoods.
We would like to raise US$5000 to
purchase project materials and here is a small budget (Seeds - $1000.00, Poly
Bags - $1500.00, Shade Cloth - $500.00, NPK Fertilizer - $500.00, Stipend -
$1500.00).
Your donations will help us to increase our production
capacity to raise and plant 50,000 or more trees by 2014 to reduce global carbon
emissions, restoring local ecosystem services, alleviating poverty and sustaining
rural livelihoods of the people. 
As a contributor, you are part of the project team and co-own
the trees so we request that you encourage your friends, your family and your
work mates to contribute, participate in tree planting activities and involve
in local environmental awareness education programs in your area. 
All contributors will receive certificates, posters, updates
on the project and also we offer special local hand weaving hand bags to first
10 generous people who contribute $100 and local hand weaving cap to first 20
people who contribute $50, these perks will be delivered, three weeks after the
campaign ends. 
As a contributor, you can also claim 100% credit for contributing
to the reduction of global carbon emissions and at the same time you should be
proud that you are creating cash income opportunities for local families in
this remote part of the world so become
a partner, make a donation and let us work together to raise and plant more trees
and make earth a cooler place to live.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

Buri - the Amazonianspiritual retreat
Buri Buri is located at about 20 km from
Tarapoto. The location is reachable by boat, motorbike or four-wheel drive
vehicle. Buri Buri is centered next to the river:  Rio Mayo, so convenient for swimming, showering, etc.The pergola
is stationed for the practice of yoga, meditation, massage, reiki, ceremony,
etc.
Hernan lives next to
the retreat center (in the house of his father) during the diet where he does
cooking and preparing medicines.

<p>The goals of the project are to build 10 biogas plants in the area to reduce deforestation caused by the need for firewood, to educate the local population about this technology, and to relieve women and children from the work of collecting firewood, and the long time spent cooking, so that they may be involved in other economic activities, thus improving their families' situations, and allowing children to attend school. <br/><br/>For more details, please see <a href=""http://kihobiogas.weebly.com/more-information-about-biogas.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">More Information About Biogas</a> and the project's <a href=""http://kihobiogas.weebly.com/index.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_parent"">main website</a>.</p>

<p>We can begin work on our project! While the entire project budget is $5,300, $2000 is enough for us to get started. It will be enough to install the first 3 biogas plants.

 conclude the crowd-sourced campaign, WaterWealth has teamed up with 
Major League 2 Pub in Chilliwack to host a celebration event on Friday, February 7th. Everyone is welcome to attend, however donors through the Indiegogo 
campaign will receive a complementary drink or dinner ticket! If you live close to the Fraser Valley we need you to come out and join the team that cares about ensuring long-term, effective protection for the region's waterways. Great news... We've secured some amazing home-water inspired works of art to offer as perks! Thanks to the generosity of Gary Haggquist -- a talented Fraser Valley artist and good friend of WaterWealth -- we will be offering prints of his original works at the donation levels of $500 (The Mighty Fraser) and $1000 (A Watershed Moment), 12""x36"" paper backed prints and 24""x36"" canvas backed prints respectively. You can also receive Gary's art as postcards at the level of $50 (Stream On).How fantastic, right? Not only would donors at these levels be super-star supporters of our efforts here at the WaterWealth Project, but they will also have a beautiful piece of artwork to enjoy and remember us by! Thanks to all who have generously given so far, and remember to help us spread the word -- please tell all your friends, family, and colleagues about The Home Waters Campaign!OUR WEALTH IS IN OUR WATER, LET'S PROTECT IT!Hey, I’m Sheila and I work as the Director of The WaterWealth Project with Larry, Nat and Ian. The WaterWealth Project’s goal is “100% Community Control over Our Local Home Waters.” We've made it our mission to empower our local residents to regain control over decisions that affect their home waters - the rivers, lakes and aquifers that are the lifeblood of our towns, cities and regions. We are non-partisan, but we engage in the political process to amplify 
the need for more local control. We encourage our fellow community members to engage alongside us as we work to make the political conversation more accessible for everyone.We want to demonstrate for communities across North America that taking action to protect our freshwater can unite a democratic movement to shift power back to where it belongs - our communities.OUR CAMPAIGN:
We focus on what brings us together, rather than what keeps us apart, but we are not shy to speak up on the critical issues. Our core values are respect for First Nations' Rights & Title, the human right to water, and local people having the power to say 'yes' or 'no' to proposals that affect them and their home waters. We believe in a sustainable economy based on businesses that plan to stay in our region, as opposed to those that extract our precious natural resources to make a quick buck, get out of town, and leave long-term costs for our children and grandchildren.We take our work very seriously, but we use creative tactics - like our blue water lycra suits -  to make water issues visible and maintain a level of fun that ensures we can stick with our mission for the long haul. How we'll winOur communities and our water wealth are facing an onslaught of threats -- pipelines, Nestle, gravel mining, diversions (see below for more detail). Fighting each of these battles individually will only get us so far. So we've decided the only way to truly succeed is by getting proactive and transforming our decision-making structures. We're going to put the power back into the hands of local people and ensure that our communities have the ability to say 'yes' or 'no' to the decisions that affect them (and their children and grandchildren).By using a strategy of community organizing and tactics of community engagement we will build a team of residents equipped with knowledge and skills to mobilize effectively. With leadership from the Sto:lo First Nations, we will support our communities in working together to develop a powerful vision and protection plan for our rivers, lakes and aquifers. With the support of tens of thousands of local residents we will ensure that government works for our communities, and in the process set a precedent for British Columbia and the rest of the continent.
Where will your donation go?


Our goal is $10,000. If we achieve our goal this will allow us to support two of our local organizers, Nat and Ian, to develop our ground game and get out on the streets engaging and mobilizing our community. This means:1) Recruiting volunteers. We know they're out there because everywhere we've gone in our communities people have been excited to be part of what we're building. But we need to be in more places and talking with more people. Hey, by the way, do you want to volunteer? If so, click here. 2) Training our volunteers. We want our volunteers to become change agents and enthusiastic practitioners of community organizing at its finest.3) Developing materials and getting these on the airwaves, in the papers and on social media. We want to ensure our volunteers are armed with the materials they need and that our campaign is reaching every household in our region.Your donation will allow us to do these things. It gives us chills just thinking about it!

We're huge fans of the Korean pop band ""B.A.P"" and thought it was a good idea to call BABYz, kpop fans or just regular good hearted to donate in the name of B.A.P. You will be getting some rewards depending on how much you donate. <br/></p><p></p><p></p>Many of us Babyz know that the members are donating things to funds, especially Yongguk.  He has been encouraging us for donating and so on. So I wanted us Babyz to do our fair share of the helping.

Hi, the project leaders on this project found the news of the terrible typhoon in the Philippines horrible and we wanted to do whatever we can to help. We're huge fans of the Korean pop band ""B.A.P"" and thought it was a good idea to call BABYz, kpop fans or just regular good hearted to donate in the name of B.A.P. You will be getting some rewards depending on how much you donate. Many of us Babyz know that the members are donating things to funds, especially Yongguk.  He has been encouraging us for donating and so on. So I wanted us Babyz to do our fair share of the helping. This is for a good cause, it might save lifes. It both saves lifes and will bring the Baby fandom and B.A.P’s name a better reputation. You don’t have to be a B.A.P fan to donate, you might be a K-Pop fan or just want to help with the things happening there right now as I write this message and you’re reading this.I will collect money for 20 days, and I want to bring in about 500$.

<p><b>Before we begin, here is the back story… </b></p>
<p>“In Spring 2011, I discovered Rainmaker Organization in Japan founded by Masanobu Fukuoka, which promotes a simple, sustainable way to plant various seeds. The organization discovered that covering the seed with clay protects the seed from exterior damage. These clay balls naturally collect water from the air to nourish the seeds inside and can be placed on any soil without the need for water. The structure of the clay ball only allows the seeds that are compatible with the soil underneath to start growing.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/170252/files/20131102001006-Rainmaker_clayballs.jpg?1383376206"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>During the 1990s, Rainmaker Organization helped grow more greens in Africa, Greece, India, and other dry lands in the hope to produce more green in the world. This was the original Rainmaker Project.</p>
<p>This sophisticated agricultural method has huge potential for sustainably revolutionizing agriculture in developing countries and also to foster interest in sustainable projects in the first world. </p>
<p>Rainmaker Organization needs effective supporters to bring about more awareness of the Rainmaker Project to continue their dream to spread more green in the world, on a personal level and at a global level. However, currently there are not enough supporters. This is especially true when the majority of Japanese people are focused on high-end goods and luxury life styles. The idea of sustainability is still taking time to penetrate into their identity.</p>
<p>After discovering Rainmaker Organization, I emailed them and they invited me to their facility where they told me more about their history and taught me how to hand-make clay balls. I left there wanting to produce new project ideas that would bring support to the organization as a visiting designer and was inspired to help draw more attention to this project. I told the organization that I would love to be a change maker and that there will be a day when I can share my vision with them.</p>
<p>So the reincarnation of the Rainmaker Project is my design gift to Japan and the rest of the world.”</p>

<p><em><strong>レインメーカープロジェクトのバックストーリー</strong><span><span></span></span><span></span></em></p>
<p><em><span><span>
</span></span></em></p>
<em><span><span><p>レインメーカー協会の基盤は、様々な植物を育てるためのシンプルで、継続可能な方法を考案した、今はなき福岡正信氏によって設立されました。</p></span></span></em><p><em><span><span>
</span></span></em></p>
<p><em>福岡正信氏は、植物の種をオーガニックな養分でできた粘土で覆う事によって外部の損傷から種子を保護することを発見しました。</em></p>
<em>
<p>これらの粘土団子＝クレイシードは種を養うために自然に空気から水を吸収し、化学肥料を必要とせず、蒔かれた土地と相性のよい植物を、自力で発芽し発育することができます。</p>
<span></span></em></span></span><p></p>
<p><em><span><span>
</span></span></em></p>
<p><em>1990年代、レインメーカーのオリジナルプロジェクトは、世界中（アフリカ、ギリシャ、インド、その他多くの乾燥地帯）で多くの<span>緑を育てることに成功。</span><span>そのシンプルで洗練された手法は、持続的に発展途上国での農業に革命を起こしました。</span></em></p>
<em>
<p>そして今、地球温暖化や気候変動への関心が高まるなか、先進国でも、大きな可能性に新たな注目が集まっています。</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>レインメーカープロジェクトの夢は、世界により多くの緑を広めることによって、地球温暖化や気候変動に立ち向かうこと。その継続のためには個人レベルの支援をグローバルに広げていくことが、効果的であることは間違いありません。</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>ところが現在は十分な賛同者が存在しません。日本人の大半は、環境へ影響を無視したローコスト製品にばかり焦点を当てているのも理由の一つです。</p>
<p>サステイナビリティの考え方は、ハイエンドなデザイン・クオリティを志向し、自然体でラグジュアリーなアイデンティティを持つ層にのみ、浸透し始めたばかりです。</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
</em></span></span><p></p>
<p><em><span><span>
</span></span></em></p>
<p><em>地球温暖化や環境への危惧を感じていた私が、レインメーカー協会の存在に気づいたとき、すぐにレインメーカー団体にメールでコンタクトをとりました。</em></p>
<em>
<p>その後、施設に私を招待していただき、そしてクレイシードの作り方と彼らの歴史について説明を受けました。<span>私はその場で、デザインとファッションをベースとしたコンセプトと共に、この協会に協力できるようなプロジェクトの提案をすることを決意しました。</span></p>
<p>私はチェンジメーカーになりたいことと、そしていつか私達のビジョンを共有できる日が来るであろう事を協会の代表者へ伝えました。</p>
<p>さらに多くのみなさんに、レインメーカープロジェクトへの関心を抱いてほしいと考えています。<span><span>今回ご紹介するレインメーカープロジェクトの新たなアプローチは、日本とまた世界へ、私からのデザインの贈り物です。</span></span></p>

<p><strong>So how do you play the game?</strong></p>
<p>Rainmaker Project teaches Rainmakers about clay balls and invites them to grow seeds as their own personalized projects and assignments while documenting and recording their activities to share amongst other fellow Rainmakers. Rainmakers earn game points through their projects. Rainmakers can send seeds to and exchange seeds with other users. Mystery seeds and bonus seeds add to the sense of play and keep the drive going. An online catalogue of seed and plant information will help Rainmakers research and identify the various seeds that they are planting and watching grow. </p>

<p><b>How do you become a Rainmaker?</b></p>
<p>The moment you support and participate in the project, you become a Rainmaker. Rainmaker Project consists of Rainmaker objects/products and fashion that serve to<br/>identify the participants as Rainmakers. Rainmaker products come individually or in a kit: the RP soil, RP seeds, RP original T-shirt, RP project instruction book and an “identity code” for each user.</p>
<p>Identity codes --like sports jersey numbers-- are used online and in person. They help to identify Rainmakers, to allow access to the online hub, to track seed exchange and user participation, and to foster connection to other Rainmakers in the game. </p>
<p>Rainmaker Fashion is exclusively available to participants in the global game. Limited Edition T-shirts will be awarded to Rainmakers with high scores. During collaborative assignments, T-shirts function as game jerseys. Participants across the globe will be able to recognize each other through their fashion and through other Rainmaker products. </p>

The game brings continuous support to the Rainmaker Organization.
“Rainmaker is a person whose influence can initiate progress or ensure success.” –Merriam Webster

（2014年には5,000人に拡大する予定です）





I am a Rainmaker


Rainmakerであることを認定された賛同者だけに提供されるファッションアイテム。
それぞれのカラーによって世界共通のステイタスを表現します。
 

 

Before we begin, here is the back story… 
“In Spring 2011, I discovered Rainmaker Organization in Japan founded by Masanobu Fukuoka, which promotes a simple, sustainable way to plant various seeds. The organization discovered that covering the seed with clay protects the seed from exterior damage. These clay balls naturally collect water from the air to nourish the seeds inside and can be placed on any soil without the need for water. The structure of the clay ball only allows the seeds that are compatible with the soil underneath to start growing.
During the 1990s, Rainmaker Organization helped grow more greens in Africa, Greece, India, and other dry lands in the hope to produce more green in the world. This was the original Rainmaker Project.
This sophisticated agricultural method has huge potential for sustainably revolutionizing agriculture in developing countries and also to foster interest in sustainable projects in the first world. 
Rainmaker Organization needs effective supporters to bring about more awareness of the Rainmaker Project to continue their dream to spread more green in the world, on a personal level and at a global level. However, currently there are not enough supporters. This is especially true when the majority of Japanese people are focused on high-end goods and luxury life styles. The idea of sustainability is still taking time to penetrate into their identity.
After discovering Rainmaker Organization, I emailed them and they invited me to their facility where they told me more about their history and taught me how to hand-make clay balls. I left there wanting to produce new project ideas that would bring support to the organization as a visiting designer and was inspired to help draw more attention to this project. I told the organization that I would love to be a change maker and that there will be a day when I can share my vision with them.
So the reincarnation of the Rainmaker Project is my design gift to Japan and the rest of the world.”
Michelle Moriyasu - Designer

レインメーカープロジェクトのバックストーリー


レインメーカー協会の基盤は、様々な植物を育てるためのシンプルで、継続可能な方法を考案した、今はなき福岡正信氏によって設立されました。

福岡正信氏は、植物の種をオーガニックな養分でできた粘土で覆う事によって外部の損傷から種子を保護することを発見しました。

これらの粘土団子＝クレイシードは種を養うために自然に空気から水を吸収し、化学肥料を必要とせず、蒔かれた土地と相性のよい植物を、自力で発芽し発育することができます。



1990年代、レインメーカーのオリジナルプロジェクトは、世界中（アフリカ、ギリシャ、インド、その他多くの乾燥地帯）で多くの緑を育てることに成功。そのシンプルで洗練された手法は、持続的に発展途上国での農業に革命を起こしました。

そして今、地球温暖化や気候変動への関心が高まるなか、先進国でも、大きな可能性に新たな注目が集まっています。


レインメーカープロジェクトの夢は、世界により多くの緑を広めることによって、地球温暖化や気候変動に立ち向かうこと。その継続のためには個人レベルの支援をグローバルに広げていくことが、効果的であることは間違いありません。


ところが現在は十分な賛同者が存在しません。日本人の大半は、環境へ影響を無視したローコスト製品にばかり焦点を当てているのも理由の一つです。
サステイナビリティの考え方は、ハイエンドなデザイン・クオリティを志向し、自然体でラグジュアリーなアイデンティティを持つ層にのみ、浸透し始めたばかりです。





地球温暖化や環境への危惧を感じていた私が、レインメーカー協会の存在に気づいたとき、すぐにレインメーカー団体にメールでコンタクトをとりました。

その後、施設に私を招待していただき、そしてクレイシードの作り方と彼らの歴史について説明を受けました。私はその場で、デザインとファッションをベースとしたコンセプトと共に、この協会に協力できるようなプロジェクトの提案をすることを決意しました。
私はチェンジメーカーになりたいことと、そしていつか私達のビジョンを共有できる日が来るであろう事を協会の代表者へ伝えました。
さらに多くのみなさんに、レインメーカープロジェクトへの関心を抱いてほしいと考えています。今回ご紹介するレインメーカープロジェクトの新たなアプローチは、日本とまた世界へ、私からのデザインの贈り物です。
Michelle Moriyasu – Designer



So how do you play the game?
Rainmaker Project teaches Rainmakers about clay balls and invites them to grow seeds as their own personalized projects and assignments while documenting and recording their activities to share amongst other fellow Rainmakers. Rainmakers earn game points through their projects. Rainmakers can send seeds to and exchange seeds with other users. Mystery seeds and bonus seeds add to the sense of play and keep the drive going. An online catalogue of seed and plant information will help Rainmakers research and identify the various seeds that they are planting and watching grow. 



Rainmakersになったあなたに起こること


レインメーカープロジェクトは、Rainmakersにくれいしーど緑化について教え、実際に育てていただきます。その成長を記録したものを他のRainmakersとの間で共有しながら独自のプロジェクトの発案や、テーマをもって種を育てるプロジェクトに招待します。
プロジェクトを通じてRainmakersはゲームのポイントを獲得できます。Rainmakersは、他のユーザーに自分の種を送る事や、相手の種と交換することもできます。ミステリーシードやサプライズシードでは驚きと遊びの感覚を育てられるでしょう。オンラインシードカタログはRainmakersが育てている種の情報を提供し、あなたの新しい挑戦を支援します。





Rainmaker Objects

レインメーカーオブジェクト

 
How do you become a Rainmaker?
The moment you support and participate in the project, you become a Rainmaker. Rainmaker Project consists of Rainmaker objects/products and fashion that serve toidentify the participants as Rainmakers. Rainmaker products come individually or in a kit: the RP soil, RP seeds, RP original T-shirt, RP project instruction book and an “identity code” for each user.
Identity codes --like sports jersey numbers-- are used online and in person. They help to identify Rainmakers, to allow access to the online hub, to track seed exchange and user participation, and to foster connection to other Rainmakers in the game. 
Rainmaker Fashion is exclusively available to participants in the global game. Limited Edition T-shirts will be awarded to Rainmakers with high scores. During collaborative assignments, T-shirts function as game jerseys. Participants across the globe will be able to recognize each other through their fashion and through other Rainmaker products. 



もうあなたはRainmakersの一員


あなたがこのプロジェクトに参加した瞬間、もうあなたはRainmakersの一員です。レインメーカープロジェクトはRainmakersとして参加者を識別するために役立つアイテムやファッションで構成されており、Rainmakersのためのオリジナルアイテムは、１つずつ、またはトータルで提供されます。
たとえばRP土、RP種子、RPオリジナルTシャツ、RPプロジェクト取扱説明書、そして、あなただけの ""識別コード""です。


識別コードは、スポーツの背番号のようにあなただけのナンバーとして、オンライン上で使用します。Rainmakersを識別し、クレイシードの交換の記録やオンラインのwebサイトへアクセスするために必要となります。


レインメーカーのファッションアイテムは、グローバルゲームの参加者に特別に提供されます。限定版Tシャツは貢献度の高いRainmakersだけのステイタス。
グループプロジェクトではTシャツが識別コードとして機能します。世界中の参加者は、お互いのファッションとアイテムを通じて、チームとしての連帯感を感じることができます。（ぜひTシャツを着ている写真をオンラインにアップロードしてください）





The Rainmaker Hubs
Rainmakers primarily engage the global game online.
Online platforms such as Facebook and official Rainmaker website serve as hubs for Rainmakers to participate in the project. On the hubs, Rainmakers can read Rainmaker features, find out about local events, post photos, and track projects worldwide.  As part of the game, online sharing earns more points and encourages conversation, collaboration, meet ups, and seed exchange amongst fellow Rainmakers. Game sharing includes posting photos of: garden projects, group plant-a-thon activities, your latest mystery seed’s growth, Rainmaker Fashion or Productsightings, etc.

 the evolution of building codes and policy is a first step. It will open and familiarize
the minds of building officials, city government, contractors and

I build modern day ""cob"" buildings (using local clay, sand and straw), teach cob workshops, and consult.  I support the expansion of these hand-sculpted earthen living sculptures into our current building culture.  I support many many people in the realization of their dream to build their own unique natural homes or spaces for very little cost in materials.  These buildings are not only healthful, inexpensive and beautiful , they also represent a movement towards building shelter that supports the long-term health of the Planet and the well-being and housing needs of People.  How many more trees can we afford to fell and concrete can our Planet absorb?AWESOME 6 MINUTE VIDEO YOU MUST SEE!!!! (by my son Viva!)My mission is to LEGALIZE MY COB BUILDING making it the first permitted 
cob structure in Santa Cruz and in a US seismic zone, and one of only a 
few in the US.  This project, once completed, sets a precedent for and 
initiates the beginning of legal cob building.  My contribution to
 the evolution of building codes and policy is a first step. It will open and familiarize
the minds of building officials, city government, contractors and 
residents with COB as a new building option that is clean, simple, sustainable and affordable.  
Being the first to permit a cob building in the City of Santa Cruz , I ask for your financial support to make it happen for all of us.  I am 
helping to make it possible, cheaper and easier for the next cob builders, until 
cob eventually becomes an approved building material on its own and cob houses will paint the landscapes and neighborhoods .  A beautiful uplifting energizing sight.Cob buildings require a minimal financial outlay for materials, which are often found on site or nearby.  They are rot-, fire-, termite-, wind-, mold- and even rodent-proof, and perform extraordinarily in earthquakes. Shake Test at Univ of British ColumbiaThey outlive wood, and can return back to Earth cleanly, unlike concrete, steel or treated wood, and do not create any waste material.  They outperform standard conventional building materials (that have strong lobbies behind them) in their overall cost/benefit and pros/cons analysis for the well-being of their inhabitants/builders and that of the Planet. Not even a question. Check out the hundreds of years old buildings that dot the Planet...even the California missions still standing after all the earthquakes...In addition to feeding the Soul's need for unique, beautiful, personable, natural spaces to reside in, cob buildings support society's call for stimulating visual experiences...Don't you smile every time you drive on the 280 North towards San Francisco and stretch your neck over to see that orange cob dome complex on the right?

Forest elephants were traditionally thought to be a subspecies of the African elephant, but recent research has identified them as a <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/12/22/us-elephant-african-idUSTRE6BK6I920101222"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">distinct species</a>, as different as Asian elephants are from mammoths.<br/><br/>That said, we know incredibly little about them.

In Central Africa, a <a href=""http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0059469"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">vast study</a> recently estimated that their numbers have declined by about 60% in just a decade, and the population now only occupies 25% of its potential range. In Ghana, forest elephants cling on in tiny remnant forests in protected areas. One of these is Kakum Conservation Area, which holds what is thought to be one of the best-studied and best-protected populations. But even here the signs are worrying - the population is small, possibly less than 200 individuals, and poaching may also be on the increase. My research uses acoustic methods, which are a non-invasive, high-rewards way to study Kakum's elephants. But although I have secured a small travel grant, there is little funding available for master's-level conservation research, so I'm asking for your help to cover the gap and make this project happen.<br/><br/></span></span></span></span></span><h3><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate"">The Goal</span></span></span></span></span></h3>

By knowing how the elephants' habitat preferences compare to places with higher levels of poaching or crop raiding, we can better protect Kakum's population. Acoustic monitoring will be particularly helpful because it will allow us to analyze whether the elephants' habitat preferences change, for example when a particular species of tree goes out of fruit.<br/><br/>To study these things, I will extend an acoustic study of Kakum's elephants that Cornell University's <a href=""http://www.birds.cornell.edu/brp/elephant/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Elephant Listening Project</a> (ELP) undertook over a decade ago.

In addition, I will record sounds of human activity in the park (particularly gunshots) to provide an ""unbiased"" estimate of hunting levels to compare to other indicators that park staff have, such as shell casings.

<h3>Why not directly reforest the whole mountain? / perché non riforestare direttamente la montagna?</h3>
<p>Well, this should be the first goal.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in these crazy times, it would be so complicated to get funding directly for it, so let's try with some tricks. Art is only an excuse to make it happen. If everything goes as we wish, after some years, Mount Olivella will have thousands of new trees and no human traces on it.<br/><br/>Chapter 01. We plant 5,000 trees</p>
<p><br/>Chapter 02. We plant, at least, 2,000 more trees</p>
<p><br/>Chapter 03. We let nature free to do what she knows better to do: grow freely and erase any human trace</p>
<p><font color=""#a6a6a6"">Questo dovrebbe essere il primo obiettivo.</font></p>
<p><font color=""#a6a6a6"">Sfortunatamente, in questi tempi folli, sarebbe complicato ottenere fondi direttamente per la riforestazione, quindi meglio provare con qualche trucco. L'arte è solo una scusa per realizzarla. Se tutto va come speriamo, dopo qualche anno, il Monte Olivella avrà migliaia di nuovi alberi e nessuna traccia umana.</font></p>
<p><font color=""#a6a6a6"">Fase 01. Piantiamo 5.000 alberi</font></p>
<p><font color=""#a6a6a6"">Fase 02. Piantiamo almeno altri 2.000 alberi</font></p>
<p><font color=""#a6a6a6"">Fase 03. Lasciamo la natura libera di fare quello che sa fare meglio: crescere liberamente e cancellare qualsiasi traccia umana.</font></p>

<h3>Project funding / Finanziamento del progetto</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>To achieve the 1st goal (chapter 01) of Breath project, we need a budget of around 60,000 €.</p>
<p>We already have at our disposal 30,000 € (half of the budget) that comes from territorial resources and the benefits from Damien Rice concert in Naples.</p>
<p>30,000 € more will come from this crowdfunding campaign. If we exceed this sum, we will try to achieve the second goal (chapter 02).</p>

</div></div>","Why this project now? / Perché questo progetto ora?We consume more water, air, flora and wildlife than the ecosystem is able to regenerate.The consequences are disastrous and there for all to see: climate changes, deforestation, hydrogeological instability, biodiversity loss.We want to plant trees to fight deforestation. We want help the environment and improve air quality by keeping the climate under control, reducing the risk of hydrogeological instability.We want to share a global consciousness message to the world. It's time to change. It's time to become aware. It's time to BREATH.Consumiamo molta più acqua, aria, flora e fauna selvatica di quanto l'ecosistema sia in grado di rigenerare.Le conseguenze sono disastrose e sotto gli occhi di tutti: cambiamenti climatici, deforestazione, dissesto idrogeologico, perdita di biodiversità. Vogliamo piantare degli alberi contro la deforestazione. Vogliamo modificare l'ambiente e migliorare la qualità dell'aria, regolando il clima e riducendo il rischio di dissesto idrogeologico.Vogliamo condividere un messaggio globale: è il momento di cambiare, è il momento di diventare consapevoli, è il momento di RESPIRARE. What's BREATH about? / Su cosa è BREATH?
Mount Olivella is a 1,025 mt. high mountain rising above the Gulf of Sapri, in Southern Italy.
It was partly deforested by the middle of 1700s, with serious consequences as the hydrogeological instability which still causes floods in the surrounding areas.
BREATH will revive Mount Olivella, bringing balance and protecting the environment. Each new tree will be a new breath for the mountain.
Il Monte Olivella si innalza per 1.025 metri sul Golfo di Sapri, nel Sud Italia.
Fu parzialmente disboscato nella seconda metà del '700 con conseguenze disastrose, come il dissesto idrogeologico che ancora oggi causa alluvioni nelle zone circostanti.
BREATH farà rinascere il Monte Olivella, riportando equilibrio e proteggendo l'ambiente. Ogni nuovo albero sarà un nuovo respiro per la montagna.
 BREATH will start with a huge organic drawing made of 5,000 new trees planted on Mount Olivella.
It is the result of a two-year long feasibility study, and it will cover a surface of 120,000 square meters, being visible from tens of kilometers away, from the sea and the surrounding towns.
Created by the Spanish artist Escif, BREATH is a battery which depicts the energy cycle.
It follows the rhythms of time and Earth, always renewing and regenerating itself and never staying the same. 
BREATH is absorbed by seasonal cycles and expresses them through the changing colors and the presence or absence of leaves.
BREATH inizierà con un grande disegno organico composto da 5.000 nuovi alberi piantati sul Monte Olivella.
Breath è il risultato di studi di fattibilità durati due anni e coprirà una superficie di 120.000 metri quadri, visibile da decine di chilometri di distanza dal mare e dai paesi limitrofi.
Ideato dall'artista spagnolo Escif, BREATH è una batteria che raffigura il ciclo energetico.
Segue i ritmi del tempo e della Terra, si rinnova, rinasce e non è mai la stessa.
BREATH è assorbita dai cicli stagionali e li esprime nel mutare dei colori e nella presenza o assenza delle foglie.

Why not directly reforest the whole mountain? / perché non riforestare direttamente la montagna?
Well, this should be the first goal.
Unfortunately, in these crazy times, it would be so complicated to get funding directly for it, so let's try with some tricks. Art is only an excuse to make it happen. If everything goes as we wish, after some years, Mount Olivella will have thousands of new trees and no human traces on it.Chapter 01. We plant 5,000 trees
Chapter 02. We plant, at least, 2,000 more trees
Chapter 03. We let nature free to do what she knows better to do: grow freely and erase any human trace
Questo dovrebbe essere il primo obiettivo.
Sfortunatamente, in questi tempi folli, sarebbe complicato ottenere fondi direttamente per la riforestazione, quindi meglio provare con qualche trucco. L'arte è solo una scusa per realizzarla. Se tutto va come speriamo, dopo qualche anno, il Monte Olivella avrà migliaia di nuovi alberi e nessuna traccia umana.
Fase 01. Piantiamo 5.000 alberi
Fase 02. Piantiamo almeno altri 2.000 alberi
Fase 03. Lasciamo la natura libera di fare quello che sa fare meglio: crescere liberamente e cancellare qualsiasi traccia umana.

 
Project funding / Finanziamento del progetto
 
To achieve the 1st goal (chapter 01) of Breath project, we need a budget of around 60,000 €.
We already have at our disposal 30,000 € (half of the budget) that comes from territorial resources and the benefits from Damien Rice concert in Naples.
30,000 € more will come from this crowdfunding campaign. If we exceed this sum, we will try to achieve the second goal (chapter 02).
 
Per raggiungere il primo obiettivo (fase 01) di Breath, abbiamo bisogno di un budget di 60.000 €. 
Abbiamo già a disposizione 30.000 € provenienti da risorse locali e dal ricavato del concerto di Damien Rice a Napoli.
Altri 30.000 € arriveranno dalla campagna di crowdfunding. Se andremo oltre questa somma, proveremo a raggiungere il secondo obiettivo (fase 02).
 

 
About us / Chi siamo
BREATH is a unique project in scope and typology, conceived and curated by Antonio Oriente and Incipit. On the process of this project, Escif had been invited to join it and think how could be able to reforest Mount Olivella.

OLIVELLA SKETCH STONE
Sketch of Breath Battery drawn on a stone coming directly from Mount Olivella. We are not really keen on taking stones from the mountain without her permission. But we firmly believe that the mountain would be happy if someone offered her 5,000 trees for this little stone.
Il disegno della batteria di Breath su una pietra del Monte Olivella. Non siamo entusiasti all'idea di portare via pietre dalla montagna senza il suo permesso, ma crediamo fermamente che lei sarebbe felice se qualcuno le offrisse 5.000 alberi nuovi in cambio di questa piccola pietra.

<p>We have
created this funding campaign so that we can establish a living tree zoo in the high altitude, cool climate region of Queensland, Australia known as the Granite Belt. </p>
<p></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">We will import coast redwood (sequoia sempervirens) tissue culture from Archangel Tree Archive in USA, via New Zealand laboratory
and into Australian Quarantine before being planted out into the Granite Belt
Arboretum. We are aiming at 200 trees in the ground. More information can be
found here: <a href=""http://www.ancienttreearchive.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.ancienttreearchive.org</a> </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This is a global preservation project to protect these endangered
and magnificent trees in a living library. We believe these clones of ancient
redwoods are genetically geared for resilience and as such, we want to
participate in the preservation of these iconic forest dwellers. Their growth
rate has been noted at up to 10 feet (3 metres) per year in the right
microclimate, and we know our skills and experience and dedication will provide
the best environment for them.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The clones
of 4,000 year old Californian Coast Redwoods will form the foundation of the
Granite Belt Arboretum. We want other people to experience the joy of an
evergreen forest of ancient majestic trees. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The
Californian Coast Redwoods are known as pest and fire retardant trees, with
their thick bark and high levels of tannin repelling both. Their ability to store carbon is noted at three times more than any other forest type in the world. These giants cannot be left to die out!</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A large
section of the Granite Belt Arboretum will focus on an organically managed ‘Food
Forest’ as a tribute to the agricultural roots of our region. It will become a
reference resource for sustainable orchard management techniques and a hive of
biodiversity and beauty.</p>
<p>We welcome
scientists, researchers and school students to access the forest for learning
opportunities.</p>

</div></div>","'Let's Create a Legacy!'                 OUR STORYWe all look
for a secluded space to regroup, refresh and rejuvenate. Granite Belt Arboretum
can offer this …plus a whole lot more.
We have
created this funding campaign so that we can establish a living tree zoo in the high altitude, cool climate region of Queensland, Australia known as the Granite Belt. 
We will import coast redwood (sequoia sempervirens) tissue culture from Archangel Tree Archive in USA, via New Zealand laboratory
and into Australian Quarantine before being planted out into the Granite Belt
Arboretum. We are aiming at 200 trees in the ground. More information can be
found here: www.ancienttreearchive.org 
This is a global preservation project to protect these endangered
and magnificent trees in a living library. We believe these clones of ancient
redwoods are genetically geared for resilience and as such, we want to
participate in the preservation of these iconic forest dwellers. Their growth
rate has been noted at up to 10 feet (3 metres) per year in the right
microclimate, and we know our skills and experience and dedication will provide
the best environment for them.
The clones
of 4,000 year old Californian Coast Redwoods will form the foundation of the
Granite Belt Arboretum. We want other people to experience the joy of an
evergreen forest of ancient majestic trees. 
The
Californian Coast Redwoods are known as pest and fire retardant trees, with
their thick bark and high levels of tannin repelling both. Their ability to store carbon is noted at three times more than any other forest type in the world. These giants cannot be left to die out!
A large
section of the Granite Belt Arboretum will focus on an organically managed ‘Food
Forest’ as a tribute to the agricultural roots of our region. It will become a
reference resource for sustainable orchard management techniques and a hive of
biodiversity and beauty.
We welcome
scientists, researchers and school students to access the forest for learning
opportunities.
We welcome people to revel in the sights, sounds
and smell of nature.

Our Budget
of $18,000 for plants only is as follows:



Our budget
is for plants only. Brett and Sonia will cover all costs including land, branding,
logo design and merchandise, landscape design, planting project costs including
site preparation (keyline ripping), soil preparation, digging of holes,
planting labour and long term watering costs as well as tree maintenance such
as pruning, thinning etc as required. We will use Brett’s mature, microbe rich
compost and our knowledge, skill, labour and passion to keep this project
alive!
Incentives
We want to
acknowledge the people who have shared in our vision with a host of once in a lifetime incentives as our way of thanking you for your support.
Incentives start from $25 for a leather notebook cover and notepad with the Granite Belt Arboretum Australia logo, and go right up to $10,000 for a unique arboretum, food, wine and provenance tour of the Granite Belt region with hosts Brett and Sonia!


Each
Coast Redwood will have a plaque dedicating the tree to the fund supporter at
the $250, $2,500 and $10,000 mark. Each of the 34 Oak Trees will also have a plaque dedicated to the supporter at the $150 Mark (Oak Tree Grove). The Koala Forest and Edible Food Forest will
have a plaque on the wall naming each supporter in the $100 (Koala Forest) and the  $125 (Edible Collection) incentive range. 
The plaques
represent a tangible form of cataloguing the Coast Redwoods for future
generations. It is a way for people to connect with the tree they have
supported. All of our trees will be catalogued and include various details in
our database as we hope to develop a map of the Granite Belt Arboretum Australia in due
course. 


Lunch for 6 people with the founders at $1,500, is a great way to get to know more about the Granite Belt Arboretum Australia, the story and effort behind it's formation and have a good laugh with some truly inspiring regional food and wine. We want to share the provenance of this region with you, so you will enjoy coming back to it for years to come.


Our Five Star Tour with Founders at $10,000 is a once in a lifetime opportunity to be treated with style! You will be collected by limousine from the Brisbane Airport and spend 4 glorious days sightseeing on the Granite Belt. You will have a personal tour of the Granite Belt Arboretum Australia by the Founders, Brett and Sonia and experience the culinary delights of this magnificent place.

The Impact
The forests of the world are disappearing fast.
If we don't do something soon, they will all be destroyed, taking away the
habitat of orangutans and other wildlife. In Indonesia alone, a forest the size
of 300 football fields is being cut down every hour - to make way for palm oil

What We Need & What You Get


If I can raise $5,000 & recruit 500 fans
(here, see below), I'll be able to join DeforestACTION this
summer! Any and all funds raised will go directly to securing and sustaining
land for reforestation and protection. Willie Smits has secured land from the Sultan

(photo: Proboscis Monkey, credit : Eric Somala)
This rainforest is the home of the proboscis monkeys, sun bears and hundreds of species of birds. We hope you can visit this amazing place.
To save the rainforest and these animals, the local community in Kalimantan must obtain income from the rainforest trees to financially survive. 
Our project will enable the village community make a  good income from growing high value Organic Rainforest Fruit. 
This will not only give them income but we will teach them about the value and importance of these rainforest trees and the wildlife that live there so they can protect  these animals and birds.
For every $10 you give we can grow 5 seedlings that will grow into Rainforest Fruit Trees. 
A community village house will be given 5 rainforest fruit tree seedlings to plant. 
A Rainforest Fruit Tree will generate over $500 per year when fully productive.
In 3 - 4 years these fruit trees will begin to produce substantial income for the local community. 
We welcome you at any time to visit our project location in Sungai Wain Forest, Kalimantan to see the progress of your trees. It is a fascinating place with many rainforest animals like sun bears, proboscis monkeys and wild birds.  
Thank you to help us spread the story of how you can save a small bit of the Indonesian Rainforest. 
WE NEED MONEY BUT MOST OF ALL WE NEED YOUR HELP TO TELL THE WORLD

What We Need & What You Get
We have already started the project with  funds from the Indonesian Rainforest Foundation. We need a total of $2500 to develop the nursery and grow these seedlings for 1 year before we give them free for planting in the community. We have already raised $300 but need another $2200 to reach our goal to supply and plant 1000 rainforest fruit trees.This means we can provide rainforest fruit tree seedlings to 200 village community homes supporting more than 1000 people. If we do not reach the final goal the funds committed will reduce the number of seedlings we can grow. Let us hope this does not happen!!(photo: Developing nursery in Sungai Wain Forest, credit : Rohim)

The Impact 


The project will have a major social impact on the community to ensure the survival of the Sungai Wain Forest area in Kalimantan and the animals that live in this forest.


The Indonesian Rainforest Foundation have similar success in our other project areas in Central Java in Brebes and Borobudur.


This project will ensure the long term protection of the rainforest fruit trees planted in the Sungai Wain Forest area.


The income from every rainforest fruit tree will help reduce the need for the local community to cut down other trees for their daily income. 


The rainforest ecosystem will become stronger and more diverse from these rainforest fruit trees.


 
  Risks & Challenges 


To reduce the loss risk in the seedling growing stage we will employ 2 experienced persons full time to maintain these seedlings during the first year.


To reduce the loss risk of fruit trees we will train a leader in each village to advise the village community on how to maintain these seedlings as they grow into rainforest fruit trees.


We will bring in nursery experts to train the community leaders in organic cultivation techniques so they do not have to rely on fertilizers and chemical at extra cost.


The advantages will be the community can get a higher price with more income from the sale of the organic fruit.

<h3><strong>Help Be Pawsitive raise $15,000 for our first production run! Check out our story, what we are about and our amazing dog treats below.</strong></h3>
<p><strong>IT ALL STARTED WITH LOLA. </strong>Lola is a former shelter dog, who is now the Chief Treat Tester at Be Pawsitive. I found Lola abandoned in a park in Arlington, Texas. Taking her to the local shelter to see if anyone had lost her, she had no microchip and after days with her picture on the lost dogs website she was put into the adoption system along with many other dogs. That is where I first saw just how many dogs are waiting for new homes, and that’s what gave me the idea to do something that can help. So I guess you can figure out by now that I adopted Lola and now we are working hard to provide a way to help bring a little happiness to dogs still waiting for homes in the form of great tasting nutritious dog treats.</p>

<p><strong>Easily Digestible Grains</strong></p>
<p>Whole spelt, millet, oats, barley, and brown rice flour are easily digestible. In addition, they are rich in nutrients, high in protein, and full of essential vitamins &amp; minerals. These grains are the foundation of our <strong>wheat free </strong>biscuit varieties.</p>
<p><strong>Whole-Wheat Flour</strong></p>
<p>Whole-Wheat Flour is used as a primary ingredient in our “original flavor” biscuits. It is an excellent source of protein and fermentable fiber. The fiber aids in intestinal health and is important for reproduction. We use coarse-ground high-protein flour, which contains the germ and bran. Wheat helps to stimulate liver functions and cleanse toxins from your dog’s body. Whole wheat contains B vitamins, folic acid, calcium, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, zinc and other minerals.</p>
<p><strong>Brown Flax Seed</strong></p>
<p>Rich in Omega 3, flax seed has been shown to possess qualities that promote good heart health, cancer prevention, and healthy skin and coat.</p>
<p><strong>Extra Virgin Olive Oil <em>(the only type of organic olive oil)</em></strong></p>
<p>Extra Virgin Olive Oil contains the optimal ratio of omega 6 and omega 3 fatty acids which play a vital role in healing inflammation, particularly in joints (arthritis), skin (allergies), and intestines (inflammatory bowel disease). Fats are also the most concentrated form of food energy providing your dog twice the energy of proteins or carbohydrates. Essential fatty acids must be added to a dog’s diet because their bodies cannot synthesize them in sufficient amounts. A deficiency of essential fatty acids may result in reduced growth or increased skin problems.</p>
<p><strong>Canola Oil</strong></p>
<p>Canola oil is high in lineolic acid (omega 6), an unsaturated essential fatty acid that plays an important role in the regulation and functioning of every organ and cell in the body. Linoleic acid also helps to balance and heal the immune system as well as reduce inflammatory reactions such as those seen in arthritis and allergic reactions.</p>
<p><strong>Eggs</strong></p>
<p>Eggs offer a host of vitamins and minerals beneficial to muscles, coat, skin, and joints. They are also an excellent source of protein, the building blocks of cells, antibodies, hormones, etc. Eggs are essential for growth, reproduction, and maintenance. They also contain essential amino acids, which cannot be synthesized by dogs and must be supplied to their diets.</p>
<p><strong>Non-Fat Dry Milk</strong></p>
<p>Milk in moderate amounts, is easily digestible, high in protein and contain amounts of vitamins &amp; minerals that are essential to your dog’s healthy diet. Vitamins B, D, and E, are necessary to help strengthen bones, fight anemia, prevent certain forms of dermatitis, and improve muscle actions. Iodine, a major mineral in milk, helps to regulate your dogs metabolism.</p>
<p><strong>Honey</strong></p>
<p>Honey contains many essential nutrients including B-complex vitamins. It helps fight colon cancer, is a natural antiseptic, promotes healing, and is a good source of energy for your dog.</p>
<p><strong>Garlic</strong></p>
<p>Garlic is an antioxidant, which in small amounts help fight infection and disease. It is a source of selenium, which aids in proper immune response, can help neutralize free radicals in your dog’s body, and minimize the effects of daily stress. Garlic also helps keep your dog’s coat healthy and is a natural repellent of biting insects.</p>
<p><strong><em>We donate the same great treats to dogs in animal shelters and rescue organizations that we sent to your dog.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>GIVING BACK TO SHELTERS. </strong>This is the part of our business that really gets us excited. Thanks to our customers we are able to provide our treats to dogs who are still waiting for homes and families. The adoption process can be long and arduous for some dogs and we want to provide something that can help during that waiting time. Not only can our treats be used to reward dogs for good behavior but also provide a way for people looking to adopt to warm up to dogs with a gesture of good faith (dog treat). Not all dogs let their personalities come out the first time you meet them so being able to give them a treat and show them your intentions are good allows for a better connection during a meet and greet and hopefully leads to more adoptions. They are also used as rewards during obedience training. Dogs that are leash trained and obedient have a higher rate of adoption. </p>

Extra Virgin Olive Oil (the only type of organic olive oil)
Extra Virgin Olive Oil contains the optimal ratio of omega 6 and omega 3 fatty acids which play a vital role in healing inflammation, particularly in joints (arthritis), skin (allergies), and intestines (inflammatory bowel disease). Fats are also the most concentrated form of food energy providing your dog twice the energy of proteins or carbohydrates. Essential fatty acids must be added to a dog’s diet because their bodies cannot synthesize them in sufficient amounts. A deficiency of essential fatty acids may result in reduced growth or increased skin problems.
Canola Oil
Canola oil is high in lineolic acid (omega 6), an unsaturated essential fatty acid that plays an important role in the regulation and functioning of every organ and cell in the body. Linoleic acid also helps to balance and heal the immune system as well as reduce inflammatory reactions such as those seen in arthritis and allergic reactions.
Eggs
Eggs offer a host of vitamins and minerals beneficial to muscles, coat, skin, and joints. They are also an excellent source of protein, the building blocks of cells, antibodies, hormones, etc. Eggs are essential for growth, reproduction, and maintenance. They also contain essential amino acids, which cannot be synthesized by dogs and must be supplied to their diets.
Non-Fat Dry Milk
Milk in moderate amounts, is easily digestible, high in protein and contain amounts of vitamins & minerals that are essential to your dog’s healthy diet. Vitamins B, D, and E, are necessary to help strengthen bones, fight anemia, prevent certain forms of dermatitis, and improve muscle actions. Iodine, a major mineral in milk, helps to regulate your dogs metabolism.
Honey
Honey contains many essential nutrients including B-complex vitamins. It helps fight colon cancer, is a natural antiseptic, promotes healing, and is a good source of energy for your dog.
Garlic
Garlic is an antioxidant, which in small amounts help fight infection and disease. It is a source of selenium, which aids in proper immune response, can help neutralize free radicals in your dog’s body, and minimize the effects of daily stress. Garlic also helps keep your dog’s coat healthy and is a natural repellent of biting insects.
We donate the same great treats to dogs in animal shelters and rescue organizations that we sent to your dog.
 
GIVING BACK TO SHELTERS. This is the part of our business that really gets us excited. Thanks to our customers we are able to provide our treats to dogs who are still waiting for homes and families. The adoption process can be long and arduous for some dogs and we want to provide something that can help during that waiting time. Not only can our treats be used to reward dogs for good behavior but also provide a way for people looking to adopt to warm up to dogs with a gesture of good faith (dog treat). Not all dogs let their personalities come out the first time you meet them so being able to give them a treat and show them your intentions are good allows for a better connection during a meet and greet and hopefully leads to more adoptions. They are also used as rewards during obedience training. Dogs that are leash trained and obedient have a higher rate of adoption. 
 
 
THE MONTHLY TREAT BOX. Our treats are shipped out at the first of each month via our monthly treat box subscription. When you sign up, you receive a different flavor each month and each box you receive provides treats for a dog in an animal shelter.

WE NEED YOUR HELP. To get started we need a little help from you guys. Be Pawsitive needs AT LEAST $15,000 to launch in June. The funding from you guys will go to help produce our wonderful treats, and help with the cost of our treat packaging and shipping boxes.
ALLOCATION OF FUNDS

PERKS FOR YOUR HELP. Your money is not just a donation; it's our seed funding to launch our product. So we want to give you back more than just a thank you, so we have come up with some great perks. Almost all of our perks give you at least one of our treat boxes, and of course for every treat box we ship out, we donate a treat box to a shelter. That includes the boxes rewarded on this campaign. Please comment with any suggestions you have on current or any future perks you would like to see. Continental US shipping only.

I want to pay them back, as well as put some money towards some much-needed equipment. And a bit of assistance towards my travel costs.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>My first goal in this project was to put together a rapid field guide. This is already done and featured on the <a href=""http://fm2.fieldmuseum.org/plantguides/guideimages.asp?ID=619"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Chicago Field Museum website</a>. It is downloadable for free. This is the first step in helping people to know what is around them.</p>
<p>A field guide will help people get in touch with their landscape so much more. The information it will share will open doors for people. I've done a lot of research both online and in academic libraries and spent a lot of time compiling information. I've talked with botanists from several countries doing my best to ensure accuracy of my identifications. In the States we are very accustomed to having easy access to knowing so much of our natural heritage. This is disappearing - quickly - in places like coastal Ecuador. While oral histories and local ecological knowledge are waning, deforestation is accelerating. <br/></p>

<p>In the

high profile proponents of a revenue-neutral carbon tax. We are building
consensus from the ground up, writing to media outlets, doing research,
collaborating with other environmental groups. Send us to DC: maybe we’ll talk
some sense into YOUR representatives.</p>

</ul></div>","Help Our CCL Group Get to DC to Lobby for a Carbon Fee and DividendHi, my name is Maria and I am the group leader of the all volunteer Citizens' Climate Lobby (CCL) in Santa Fe. I, along with many of our group members, am a long-time climate activist. We've joined CCL because we recognize the need for federal legislation on energy and climate issues- you just can't adapt to the moving target of human-induced climate chaos. And, we believe that CCL has the winning formula to succeed on this issue.Modeled after Gandhi's Satyagraha movement, Citizens' Climate Lobby's purpose is to create the political will for a livable world and to empower individuals to exercise their personal and political power. Economists across the political spectrum have said that CCL's proposed revenue-neutral carbon tax is the most efficient policy proposal to combat carbon emissions. 
At the Citizens' Climate Lobby conference in DC in June we will strategize how to be more effective catalysts of action, and to meet with our
legislators – including those who are not convinced of the need for action.
Your contribution will help us learn the best practices and messaging to
convince Congress of the need to take decisive, courageous action.

<br/><h3>Restore the Chinampas in México City
</h3>You can collaborate in <b>The Chinampa
'Tlicuili', a sustainable farm </b>inside of one of few green areas of
Mexico City. Even though the natural area were it stands is a <b>place
protected by federal and international laws, the urban pressure and
the abandonment of sustainable farming activities places it in danger
of extinction</b>. This fact compromises the ability to retain the rain
water, and mediate other environment impacts, like pollution,
breaking the city’s precarious balance. Our project aims for the
return to sustainable farming, being a model for restoring and
preserving the area.<br/><p>We have been learning to cultivate and
integrate the farm's work since 2011. By now we have built a room
with natural construction techniques, and activated four areas: a
medicinal garden, a greenhouse, a biointensive orchard, and a
circular orchard. Beside the work in this space, we have intervened
in another chinampa where we were hired to design and implement the
construction of a therapeutic garden and natural buildings. These
included a shade house, a bamboo salon, a filter channel, and a
composting toilet. Also we have collaborated in multiple educational
programs with different schools and universities and our professional
formation allows us to overcome all the inconveniences we found in
the way.<br/>At the same time we have consolidated us into a working
team, capable to perform this kind of projects with our own hands and
at low costs, while involving the community. We trust in the power of
the community because we experience that power each day on the
chinampa. That’s why we believe we can make miracles happen, with a
little help from you.<br/>If you want to see a more detailed

<br/><h3>
<b>Our Experience and the planning proccess </b><br/>
</h3>
<b>The project</b> of the Chinampa Tlicuilli
<b>started 10 years ago</b>, in the search of a more healthy and sustainable
way of living, without leaving the city, hoping there are solutions
in natural urban landscapes. <b>Permaciudad as a team has been working
in this area for 5 years</b>, and we have been getting close with
agriculture practices. Also part of the team has participated in
different workshops and university degree programs in agriculture,
natural building and permaculture. <br/><p>Last year we had various
activities that included a small internship (with 5 volunteers) in
natural building that re-built a room that now is used for multiple
purposes with ecological techniques (the entrance to the temazcal,
massage room, changing room for the guests and bedroom for the
guard). We also worked together with the Autonomous University of
Mexico City (UACM) developing the circular orchard and teaching the
students about agro-ecology, the chinampas and permaculture.

<p>We are
planning to use the economic resource of the<b> crowdfunding campaign </b>to
fund our efforts. After achieving this goal we are going to <b>work
without volunteers </b>for two weeks to be able to buy the material<b>,</b>
transport and prepare it, and set up the columns and the crossbars
that will support the walls and the roof. The other part of the
materials that are used for the construction are local and from
natural sources so when the volunteers come the first two days we
will spend this time on theoretic sessions and preparing the
materials (cow manure, straw, etc). We want to invite some friends to work that are a carpenter and a builder and that will support with wood tools and getting the foundation in place. After that, <b>with the volunteers</b>,
we are going to work the remaining 10 days on learning how to do the
mixture and build a wall. They would also be able to watch the
installation of the metal sheets for the roof. The last 4 days would
be spent on the details of the construction (plastering, construction
of the stove, installing the dishwasher, the doors and windows, the
stump floor, and the thatched roof). If you want to see a detailed

<p>Hola, somos un grupo interdisciplinario (formado en diferentes áreas: economía, psicología y ciencias biológicas) enfocado en proyectos ecológicos basados en el modelo de permacultura. Queremos que formes parte de nuestra comunidad y nos ayudes a construir la cocina y un salón de usos múltiples dentro de la Chinampa Tlicuilli (Fogón de tres piedras en Náhuatl) para poder brindar un mejor servicio cuando grupos escolares y visitantes vengan a la granja, así como para los campamentos y programas de aprendizaje que ocurran en la chinampa. Esto tendría un impacto positivo al involucrar a la comunidad local de la Ciudad de México y al generar un modelo para la recuperación del área.<br/>Si nos apoyas serás parte de un proyecto que está desarrollando un modelo para el desarrollo sustentable en una chinampa de 1.5 acreas (0.7 ha) que regenere el ambiente natural  y reviva las prácticas agrícolas ancestrales locales. Con tu apoyo  contaremos con las comodidades necesarias para involucrar a la comunidad local  y mejorar las condiciones de trabajo dentro de la chinampa. El proyecto está localizado en un área de bajos recursos económicos, pero que se desarrolla de forma acelerada dentro de la Ciudad de México y donde existe una necesidad  de trabajo dignos. Además es una de las ciudades más contaminadas y el área natural protegida al oriente de la ciudad, donde el proyecto se encuentra, tiene serios problemas de hundimientos e inundaciones mientras enfrenta una presión por parte del desarrollo urbano. Creemos que involucrando a la comunidad  y encontrando un uso económico para esta área permitirá preservarla con su ecosistema natural  como ha sido por cientos de años para producir comida. Al mismo tiempo  esto tendrá un efecto positivo en  en la polución del aire ayudando a mitigar el cambio climático mientras se mejora la economía local.<br/><br/>Convierte en un Guardián de la Chinampa</p>
<p>Queremos construir la cocina y un salón de usos múltiples con nuestra comunidad como un programa de integración. Por esta razón realizamos un diseño participativo involucrando a todos los que trabajan en la chinampa y algunos técnicos que nos guiaron en la parte arquitectónica y en los protocolos de construcción. Ahora estamos fondeando  los recursos económicos para la compra del material y los gastos del internado que se llevarán a cabo en la construcción e integrar a nuestra comunidad a las actividades de 2017. La cocina y el salón de usos múltiples consta de 112 m2 de construcción, lamina de metal, un techo natural, paredes de COB, piso de tocones, una alacena, estufa, lavadero, un sistema de captura de agua y un sistema híbrido con una celda fotovoltáica y un generador eólico que se encuentra en la granja para abastecer la cocina y el salón de usos múltiples.<br/>Si quieres ver nuestro gastos con más detalles haz click-<br/><br/>Recompensas para nuestros donatarios</p>
<p>La primera recompensa es nuestro cariño y gratitud por tu apoyo. También contamos con una memoria digital personalizada, un temazcal, un taller de agroecología, servicio de consultoría y la oportunidad de participar en un internado de construcción natural.<br/>El temazcal se realiza dentro de la chinampra tlicuilli y es una actividad que se va desde las 10:00 hasta las 18:00 horas que incluye la comida  y el baño de vapor prehispánico con plantas medicinales. En el taller de agroecología que ocurrirá en Febrero de 2017 en la chinampa vas a tener la posibilidad de aprender cómo cultivar tu comida y disfrutarás de una noche de campamento con todo incluido. <br/>Si alcanzamos el 50% de nuestro objetivo contruiremos la cocina sin el salón de usos múltiples. Si alcanzamos el 70% de nuestro objetivo haremos la cocina y el comedor sin el techo de tule ni el piso de tocones y eso lo instalaremos en otra ocasión.<br/><br/>Restaurando las chinampas en la Ciudad de México<br/><br/>Puedes colaborar en la Chinampa Tlicuilli, una granja sustentable dentro de una de las pocas áreas verdes dentro de la Ciudad de México. Aunque este lugar se encuentra protegido por leyes federales e internacionales la presión urbana y el abandono de las actividades agrícolas sustentables la ponen en peligro de desaparecer. Esto comprometería la capacidad para retener agua de lluvia y mediar otros impactos ambientales como la contaminación atmosférica. Nuestro proyecto busca el regreso a las actividades sustentables siendo un modelo para la recuperación y preservación del área.<br/>Nosotros hemos estado aprendiendo a cultivar y nos integramos al trabajo desde 2011. En estos momentos hemos hecho un cuarto con elementos naturales y hemos activado cuatro áreas de cultivo: un jardín medicinal, un huerto circular, un invernadero y un huerto biointensivo. Además del espacio en la chinampa hemos colaborado en programas educativos con diferentes escuelas y universidades. Nuestra formación profesional nos ayuda a sobrepasar los retos e inconvenientes que nos encontramos en el camino.<br/>Al mismo tiempo nos hemos consolidado como un grupo capaz de realizar este tipo de proyectos con nuestras propias manos y a bajo costo mientras involucramos a la comunidad. Creemos en el poder de la comunidad porque lo vivimos todos los días. Es por eso que consideramos que podemos hacer maravillas con un poco de tu ayuda y la de tus amigos.<br/><br/><br/>Nuestra experiencia y el proceso de planeación<br/><br/>El proyecto de la Chinampa Tlicuilli inició hace 10 años por la búsqueda de un estilo de vida más saludable sin dejar la ciudad,  creyendo que existen soluciones a los paisajes urbano-naturales. Como Permaciudad hemos estado trabajando 5 años  en el área y nos hemos familiarizado con las prácticas agrícolas ancestrales y las actuales. Además parte del equipo ha participado en programas educativos de permacultura, construcción natural, agricultura y agroecología.<br/>El año pasado realizamos varias actividades que incluyeron un internado (con 5 asistentes) en construcción natural, donde  reconstruimos un cuarto que hoy es usado para múltiples funciones (entrada al Temazcal, cuarto de masajes, vestidor y cuarto de vigilancia. Además participamos con la Universidad de la Ciudad de México (UACM) en el desarrollo del huerto circular como parte de un programa educativo en el que se les enseñó a los estudiantes de agroecología, las chinampas y permacultura.<br/>Estamos planeando obtener el recurso económico a través de la campaña de Crowdfunding. Después de lograr esta meta vamos a trabajar sin los voluntarios por 2 semanas para poder comprar, transportar y preparar todo el material para la construcción. La otra parte de los materiales son de origen local y van a ser recolectados durante los primeros días del internado. Queremos invitar a algunos amigos, carpintero y albañil  a trabajar para que nos apoyen con las herramientas para el trabajo de la madera y levantar los cimientos. Cuando lleguen los voluntarios vamos a dedicar los siguientes días a sesiones teóricas y la recolecta de materiales. Los asistentes van a poder observar la instalación de los travesaños y el techo. Los últimos 4 días se realizarán los detalles de la construcción  (revoque, construcción de la estufa,  puertas y ventana, el piso de troncos y el techo de carrizo). <br/><br/>Con un poco de tu ayuda y la de tus amigos<br/><br/>Si no tienes los recursos económicos para apoyar el proyecto de “Chinampa Helper” por favor ayúdanos a llegar a más personas. Juntos podemos cambiar el mundo, involucrando a la comunidad cercana a nosotros y cuidando la naturaleza en el desarrollo de un proyecto sustentable en una de las ciudades más grandes del mundo.<br/>Ayúdanos difundiendo para alcanzar nuestro objetivo, <br/></p>

dishwasher, a hybrid system mixing the wind generator we already have
with a solar panel to be able to power the kitchen and dinning room. 
If you want to see our expenses and our schedule for the
construction to get a clearer idea of where your money is going, take
a look here
Four our contributors we have different perks: The lowest is our Love and gratitude to your support. We also have a Personalized Digital Memory, a sweat lodge, an Agroecology workshop, individual consultancy services and you opportunity to be part of an internship in Natural building.
The sweat lodge takes part inside the chinampa and its a day long activity which also includes one meal and the sweat with use of therapeutic medicinal flowers. The Agroecology workshop will occur in February of 2017 in the chinampa where you are going to learn all about the chinampa ancient agricultural system, we will show you how to grow your own food and you will enjoy of one night camping with all meals included. The internship in natural building is going to take place in November 2016 during the construction of the kitchen and the community room, it includes all accommodation (camping) and meals during the internship.
If we
reach 50 % of the goal we will build the kitchen without the dinning
room. If 70% of our goal is funded we will construct the kitchen and
dinning room, but without the floor or the thatched roof, which we
will install another time.


Restore the Chinampas in México City
You can collaborate in The Chinampa
'Tlicuili', a sustainable farm inside of one of few green areas of
Mexico City. Even though the natural area were it stands is a place
protected by federal and international laws, the urban pressure and
the abandonment of sustainable farming activities places it in danger
of extinction. This fact compromises the ability to retain the rain
water, and mediate other environment impacts, like pollution,
breaking the city’s precarious balance. Our project aims for the
return to sustainable farming, being a model for restoring and
preserving the area.We have been learning to cultivate and
integrate the farm's work since 2011. By now we have built a room
with natural construction techniques, and activated four areas: a
medicinal garden, a greenhouse, a biointensive orchard, and a
circular orchard. Beside the work in this space, we have intervened
in another chinampa where we were hired to design and implement the
construction of a therapeutic garden and natural buildings. These
included a shade house, a bamboo salon, a filter channel, and a
composting toilet. Also we have collaborated in multiple educational
programs with different schools and universities and our professional
formation allows us to overcome all the inconveniences we found in
the way.At the same time we have consolidated us into a working
team, capable to perform this kind of projects with our own hands and
at low costs, while involving the community. We trust in the power of
the community because we experience that power each day on the
chinampa. That’s why we believe we can make miracles happen, with a
little help from you.If you want to see a more detailed

Our Experience and the planning proccess 

The project of the Chinampa Tlicuilli
started 10 years ago, in the search of a more healthy and sustainable
way of living, without leaving the city, hoping there are solutions
in natural urban landscapes. Permaciudad as a team has been working
in this area for 5 years, and we have been getting close with
agriculture practices. Also part of the team has participated in
different workshops and university degree programs in agriculture,
natural building and permaculture. Last year we had various
activities that included a small internship (with 5 volunteers) in
natural building that re-built a room that now is used for multiple
purposes with ecological techniques (the entrance to the temazcal,
massage room, changing room for the guests and bedroom for the
guard). We also worked together with the Autonomous University of
Mexico City (UACM) developing the circular orchard and teaching the
students about agro-ecology, the chinampas and permaculture. 


We are
planning to use the economic resource of the crowdfunding campaign to
fund our efforts. After achieving this goal we are going to work
without volunteers for two weeks to be able to buy the material,
transport and prepare it, and set up the columns and the crossbars
that will support the walls and the roof. The other part of the
materials that are used for the construction are local and from
natural sources so when the volunteers come the first two days we
will spend this time on theoretic sessions and preparing the
materials (cow manure, straw, etc). We want to invite some friends to work that are a carpenter and a builder and that will support with wood tools and getting the foundation in place. After that, with the volunteers,
we are going to work the remaining 10 days on learning how to do the
mixture and build a wall. They would also be able to watch the
installation of the metal sheets for the roof. The last 4 days would
be spent on the details of the construction (plastering, construction
of the stove, installing the dishwasher, the doors and windows, the
stump floor, and the thatched roof). If you want to see a detailed
schedule of the construction please click here.

With a little help from you and your friends
If you don't have the  economic funds
to support the Chinampa Helper project please help us reach more people. We can change the world together, 
involving the community around us, taking care of nature and
developing a sustainable enterprise  in one of the biggest cities on
earth.

 Please help us spreading the voice and achieving our goal.

Nosotros y las Chinampas
Hola, somos un grupo interdisciplinario (formado en diferentes áreas: economía, psicología y ciencias biológicas) enfocado en proyectos ecológicos basados en el modelo de permacultura. Queremos que formes parte de nuestra comunidad y nos ayudes a construir la cocina y un salón de usos múltiples dentro de la Chinampa Tlicuilli (Fogón de tres piedras en Náhuatl) para poder brindar un mejor servicio cuando grupos escolares y visitantes vengan a la granja, así como para los campamentos y programas de aprendizaje que ocurran en la chinampa. Esto tendría un impacto positivo al involucrar a la comunidad local de la Ciudad de México y al generar un modelo para la recuperación del área.Si nos apoyas serás parte de un proyecto que está desarrollando un modelo para el desarrollo sustentable en una chinampa de 1.5 acreas (0.7 ha) que regenere el ambiente natural  y reviva las prácticas agrícolas ancestrales locales. Con tu apoyo  contaremos con las comodidades necesarias para involucrar a la comunidad local  y mejorar las condiciones de trabajo dentro de la chinampa. El proyecto está localizado en un área de bajos recursos económicos, pero que se desarrolla de forma acelerada dentro de la Ciudad de México y donde existe una necesidad  de trabajo dignos. Además es una de las ciudades más contaminadas y el área natural protegida al oriente de la ciudad, donde el proyecto se encuentra, tiene serios problemas de hundimientos e inundaciones mientras enfrenta una presión por parte del desarrollo urbano. Creemos que involucrando a la comunidad  y encontrando un uso económico para esta área permitirá preservarla con su ecosistema natural  como ha sido por cientos de años para producir comida. Al mismo tiempo  esto tendrá un efecto positivo en  en la polución del aire ayudando a mitigar el cambio climático mientras se mejora la economía local.Convierte en un Guardián de la Chinampa
Queremos construir la cocina y un salón de usos múltiples con nuestra comunidad como un programa de integración. Por esta razón realizamos un diseño participativo involucrando a todos los que trabajan en la chinampa y algunos técnicos que nos guiaron en la parte arquitectónica y en los protocolos de construcción. Ahora estamos fondeando  los recursos económicos para la compra del material y los gastos del internado que se llevarán a cabo en la construcción e integrar a nuestra comunidad a las actividades de 2017. La cocina y el salón de usos múltiples consta de 112 m2 de construcción, lamina de metal, un techo natural, paredes de COB, piso de tocones, una alacena, estufa, lavadero, un sistema de captura de agua y un sistema híbrido con una celda fotovoltáica y un generador eólico que se encuentra en la granja para abastecer la cocina y el salón de usos múltiples.Si quieres ver nuestro gastos con más detalles haz click-Recompensas para nuestros donatarios
La primera recompensa es nuestro cariño y gratitud por tu apoyo. También contamos con una memoria digital personalizada, un temazcal, un taller de agroecología, servicio de consultoría y la oportunidad de participar en un internado de construcción natural.El temazcal se realiza dentro de la chinampra tlicuilli y es una actividad que se va desde las 10:00 hasta las 18:00 horas que incluye la comida  y el baño de vapor prehispánico con plantas medicinales. En el taller de agroecología que ocurrirá en Febrero de 2017 en la chinampa vas a tener la posibilidad de aprender cómo cultivar tu comida y disfrutarás de una noche de campamento con todo incluido. Si alcanzamos el 50% de nuestro objetivo contruiremos la cocina sin el salón de usos múltiples. Si alcanzamos el 70% de nuestro objetivo haremos la cocina y el comedor sin el techo de tule ni el piso de tocones y eso lo instalaremos en otra ocasión.Restaurando las chinampas en la Ciudad de MéxicoPuedes colaborar en la Chinampa Tlicuilli, una granja sustentable dentro de una de las pocas áreas verdes dentro de la Ciudad de México. Aunque este lugar se encuentra protegido por leyes federales e internacionales la presión urbana y el abandono de las actividades agrícolas sustentables la ponen en peligro de desaparecer. Esto comprometería la capacidad para retener agua de lluvia y mediar otros impactos ambientales como la contaminación atmosférica. Nuestro proyecto busca el regreso a las actividades sustentables siendo un modelo para la recuperación y preservación del área.Nosotros hemos estado aprendiendo a cultivar y nos integramos al trabajo desde 2011. En estos momentos hemos hecho un cuarto con elementos naturales y hemos activado cuatro áreas de cultivo: un jardín medicinal, un huerto circular, un invernadero y un huerto biointensivo. Además del espacio en la chinampa hemos colaborado en programas educativos con diferentes escuelas y universidades. Nuestra formación profesional nos ayuda a sobrepasar los retos e inconvenientes que nos encontramos en el camino.Al mismo tiempo nos hemos consolidado como un grupo capaz de realizar este tipo de proyectos con nuestras propias manos y a bajo costo mientras involucramos a la comunidad. Creemos en el poder de la comunidad porque lo vivimos todos los días. Es por eso que consideramos que podemos hacer maravillas con un poco de tu ayuda y la de tus amigos.Nuestra experiencia y el proceso de planeaciónEl proyecto de la Chinampa Tlicuilli inició hace 10 años por la búsqueda de un estilo de vida más saludable sin dejar la ciudad,  creyendo que existen soluciones a los paisajes urbano-naturales. Como Permaciudad hemos estado trabajando 5 años  en el área y nos hemos familiarizado con las prácticas agrícolas ancestrales y las actuales. Además parte del equipo ha participado en programas educativos de permacultura, construcción natural, agricultura y agroecología.El año pasado realizamos varias actividades que incluyeron un internado (con 5 asistentes) en construcción natural, donde  reconstruimos un cuarto que hoy es usado para múltiples funciones (entrada al Temazcal, cuarto de masajes, vestidor y cuarto de vigilancia. Además participamos con la Universidad de la Ciudad de México (UACM) en el desarrollo del huerto circular como parte de un programa educativo en el que se les enseñó a los estudiantes de agroecología, las chinampas y permacultura.Estamos planeando obtener el recurso económico a través de la campaña de Crowdfunding. Después de lograr esta meta vamos a trabajar sin los voluntarios por 2 semanas para poder comprar, transportar y preparar todo el material para la construcción. La otra parte de los materiales son de origen local y van a ser recolectados durante los primeros días del internado. Queremos invitar a algunos amigos, carpintero y albañil  a trabajar para que nos apoyen con las herramientas para el trabajo de la madera y levantar los cimientos. Cuando lleguen los voluntarios vamos a dedicar los siguientes días a sesiones teóricas y la recolecta de materiales. Los asistentes van a poder observar la instalación de los travesaños y el techo. Los últimos 4 días se realizarán los detalles de la construcción  (revoque, construcción de la estufa,  puertas y ventana, el piso de troncos y el techo de carrizo). Con un poco de tu ayuda y la de tus amigosSi no tienes los recursos económicos para apoyar el proyecto de “Chinampa Helper” por favor ayúdanos a llegar a más personas. Juntos podemos cambiar el mundo, involucrando a la comunidad cercana a nosotros y cuidando la naturaleza en el desarrollo de un proyecto sustentable en una de las ciudades más grandes del mundo.Ayúdanos difundiendo para alcanzar nuestro objetivo,",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

been working to protect and restore the ecosystems of Eastern Oregon for 24
years. We work to stop or modify projects on federal lands that threaten
ecological integrity and biodiversity, such as logging, road building,
livestock grazing, herbicide and biocide use, and mining. Our work area
includes the Blue Mountains in the Malheur, Ochoco, and Umatilla National
Forests, and the Eastern Oregon Cascades in the Deschutes National Forest. Our
work is important for the conservation of numerous species, including salmon,
wolves, lynx, rare woodpeckers, Pacific fishers, marten, and wolverine.</p><p>We<span>
field-check every major timber sale in our geographic work area. Getting to
look at timber sales and grazing allotments in person provides us with valuable
information including possible legal violations within the timber sale, specific
environmental conditions, and which areas to prioritize for defending. During
the upcoming field season we will field-check eight major timber sales and
three livestock grazing allotments. Volunteers are the backbone of our
field-checking efforts. </span>Through our summer volunteer program, we have trained over 200 interns in forest ecology and
activist skills.</p><p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1361465/files/20150406225926-tumblr_mnnc5g9DpB1srozyho1_1280.jpg?1428386366"" src="""" style=""width: 367px; height: 552px;""/></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(119, 119, 119); font-style: italic; background-color: initial;"">Photo of an intern in a stand of healthy Old Growth Ponderosa Pine Trees</span><br/></p><p><br/></p><h3></h3><h3>What are some of our accomplishments?</h3><p>We
have a proven track record of successfully defending forests from ecologically
destructive timber sales and other projects. We have stopped the logging of
many thousands of acres of forests, including ancient and never-logged forests,
post-fire and riparian areas, moist mixed-conifer forests, and potential
wilderness and roadless areas. In 2014 alone, we and our environmental allies saved
over 10,000 large trees and stopped logging on approximately 8,800 acres in the
Snow Basin timber sale. This legal victory in the Ninth Circuit Court upheld
the argument that the Forest Service could not move forward with their plans to
violate existing legal standards in the Snow Basin sale (such as those
protecting large trees), and set important precedent providing for increased
protections for other similar timber sales. In 2014 we also stopped logging on
1,300 acres in the Rocket timber sale. These are only a few of our
accomplishments! Please see our website to learn about some of our other many
accomplishments.</p><p><br/></p><h3></h3><h3>What is at stake?</h3><p>This field season will be one of our busiest yet. The timber
sales we will be field-checking pose threats to water quality, important
wildlife habitats, and numerous species. For example, the Tiger-Webb sale in the
Umatilla National Forest proposes logging in previously unlogged and pristine
forest, roadless areas, scenic canyons, and moist-mixed conifer forest. Logging
is also planned in steep areas over streams- potentially putting water quality
and fish at risk. The Ringo timber sale on the Deschutes National Forest proposes
to log in Northern spotted owl habitat,  other important wildlife habitats, and areas
with high recreational use. The Ringo sale would also log in magnificent mixed
conifer old growth forests containing Sugar pine, White pine, and rare Shasta
redfir, as well as Mountain Hemlock, Grand fir, Douglas fir, and Ponderosa
pine. The Magone timber sale on the Malheur National Forest plans to
extensively log beautiful forests around the popular Magone Lake recreation
area, manage inventoried roadless areas, and further degrades mixed conifer and
Ponderosa forests in already over-logged and over-grazed areas. Several of the livestock
grazing allotments we will be surveying pose threats to water quality and fish,
and may negatively affect Redband trout, rare Oregon spotted frogs, and
Columbia spotted frogs. </p><p><br/></p><p></p><h3>How will these funds be used?</h3><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Timber sales on National
Forests in eastern Oregon have greatly increased in size compared to recent
years. In past years, timber sales ranged from 2,000 to 6,000 acres per sale.
Average timber sale size is now 4,000 to 10,000 acres of commercial logging per
sale. Consequently, our workload in relation to
defending these areas from logging has also increased. In response, we have recently
expanded our paid staff from one to two people. In addition, over the last few
years our average volunteer force has increased from a dozen or so volunteers per
field season to 45 in 2014.</span></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><br/></span></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1361510/files/20150406233627-tumblr_mnncb6xd6z1srozyho1_1280.jpg?1428388587"" src="""" style=""width: 394.824175824176px; height: 589px;""/></p>

<p>It’s hard not to be impressed by the central Andean region in Ancash, Peru with its striking landscape at 3.000 meters above sea level (more than 9,000 feet). Here is where the mountain chains aptly named <em>Cordillera Blanca</em> for its snow and <em>Cordillera Negra</em> for its striking features run parallel, where<em> campesinos</em> crowd the markets in their colored clothes, where 4.000 varieties of potatoes grow to flavour any Peruvian dish. The area includes the town of Yungay, destroyed by an earthquake in 1970 and entirely rebuilt by the citizens themselves. Despite the pristine mountain setting, the Andean communities face daily challenges:</p>

<p>During this experience, a local association called <strong>""Charities of Yungay"" asked us to design and build a multi-purpose facility that seeks solutions to the many challenges facing the elderly and children in their community.</strong></p>
<p>We are taking on the design of this center with the aim of entrusting it to the local organization.

LIFE IN THE PERUVIAN ANDES

It’s hard not to be impressed by the central Andean region in Ancash, Peru with its striking landscape at 3.000 meters above sea level (more than 9,000 feet). Here is where the mountain chains aptly named Cordillera Blanca for its snow and Cordillera Negra for its striking features run parallel, where campesinos crowd the markets in their colored clothes, where 4.000 varieties of potatoes grow to flavour any Peruvian dish. The area includes the town of Yungay, destroyed by an earthquake in 1970 and entirely rebuilt by the citizens themselves. Despite the pristine mountain setting, the Andean communities face daily challenges:
PROBLEMS

Lack of drinking water
One of the main problems that impacts the “campesinos” livelihood and health, it involves:
- Inability to drink natural flowing water;
- Inability to eat raw fruits and vegetables;
- Inability to provide water sources for animals.


Abandoned Elderly
Life in the Andes is particularly difficult for the elderly whose lives are defined by hard laborious work in the fields that lead to :
- Inability to travel for long distances, to buy food and water, and to cultivate their land because of fatigue and illness;
- High cost of medication and treatment;
- Considerable distance between home and health posts;
- Absence of family support for cultural reasons and community understanding about this issue.


Lack of support for children
Alcoholism is a widespread problem for this community. Fathers of families frequently drink excessively and become aggressive towards their family members, especially their children. The youngest members of the family are forced to work the land, tend to the store or the market stand under the harsh treatment from their parents.
There are few options of assistance for these families and limited knowledge of child psychology issues.

These problems are the major reasons for us to design and realize this project.
ABOUT US AND OUR PERUVIAN PARTNERS
We are both 30-year-old Italian architects who have lived as volunteers with the movement, OMG (Operation Mato Grosso www.artesanosdonbosco.com), which has worked for more than 40 years in Latin America, and on behalf of an NGO IBO Italy (http://www.iboitalia.org/it/  and  http://www.iboitalia.org/it/progetti-nel-mondo).
During this experience, a local association called ""Charities of Yungay"" asked us to design and build a multi-purpose facility that seeks solutions to the many challenges facing the elderly and children in their community.
We are taking on the design of this center with the aim of entrusting it to the local organization. Our devotion for this place and its people is demonstrated in the work we’ve already done as volunteers with the OMG movement that organizes free schools and co-operatives of Peruvian artisans.

THE PROJECT:
A PLACE TO EAT, TO PLAY, TO REST AND TO FIND  THE SMILE AT LAST!

What do we want to accomplish?
Our whole project consists of a multi-purpose facility that will accommodate 50 elderly and 10 children. The structure will consist of several pavilions with different functions to be carried out in several stages. The remaining part of the land is designed for green spaces available to the whole community and gardens managed by the project’s collaborators who will seek to employ local residents.
The structure will be built on a plot of land in Yungay measuring almost 1300 square meters which has already been purchased by the ""Charity of Yungay"" (local association), through a fundraising activity.
This fundraising ($ 40,000) is aimed particularly for the completion of the first pavilion that includes the kitchen, dining hall and toilets.


Who is realizing the project?
The whole project will be coordinated and constructed by members of the cooperative ""Artesanos Don Bosco"" OMG.
THE PHASES OF CONSTRUCTION OF THE ENTIRE PROJECT (long-run goal)

Pavilion 1: kitchen, dining hall and toilet and arrangement of the outer (green spaces and gardens) _ SUBJECT TO THIS FUNDRAISING_ 
Pavilion 2: nursing care and clinics open to the entire community
Pavilion 3: rooms for seniors who need assistance
Pavilion 4: workshops and activities for children (bakery and tailoring)
HOW CAN YOU HELP US?

This is your chance to help those who truly need the help.
GIVE A SMILETO:


Children who have grown up to fast in the adult working world for lack of a place to play and feel safe;

Single mothers who have to work long hours to secure basic needs ;

Elderly persons who have little strength in them and few family around them for support.
ALL TOGETHER WE CAN HELP THEM!!!

We can be strong.
We can change people's lives.
With our experience we have understood that it’s possible to do it so that we believe strongly in this concrete possibility to provide these Peruvian people with a great joy and a better life.
We look forward to starting this project as soon as we receive your funds and keep you updated with the progress reached day by day.
We will do our best to achieve these results and even now we thank you so much for your contribution and for your ""GIVING SMILES"".

The smile of these people;
The satisfaction of giving them a better life;

New friends, because we will put you into contact with them and you could write them whenever you want

<p><span class=""notranslate""><strong>What We Need</strong></span></p>
<p>Like all Indiegogo creators I would love to exceed the amount that I aksed for and make a longer film than a short film.

<p><strong>Daphne is the most beautiful and happy dolphin living in her big blue ocean. She had lots of friends and is always very positive and optimistic until one day she spotted some dirty brown water in her ocean. She also comes across some friends tangled in plastic and covered in oil and she knows that she must do something. She decides to gather her friends to send a message with love because nobody listens to a message filled with anger.<br/><br/>This is a wonderful way to help teach children to be kind to everyone and to love themselves most of all. It also raises the issue of pollution and the dangerous effects it has on our friends in the ocean presented in a way children can understand and relate to. The most valuable lesson is to send your message with love not filled with anger so that others will listen and understand.<br/><br/>Daphne’s message is to teach children about our beautiful oceans and to show by example how to take care of our oceans and our planet by recycling and being aware and concerned for the future of our planet and our children.

The money will cover the cost of the stolen laptop, and help pay for programs and services that help Alison do her job: Microsoft office for writing scathing articles about the failure of government regulatory oversight; cell phone for interviewing executives and government officials; bike repair for sweltering summer rides down to court houses and libraries, and other features of the investigative life. 
More information
Check out Alison's recent picece in the Washington Monthly about the mismanagement of Atlantic menhaden by the regulatory agency charged with overseeing marine species in state waters.

Each solar system includes a light, a torch and a mobile phone charging function. For Kulangwa ca. 50 solar systems are needed.

</div></div>","Brief project description

What we want to achieve

We want to
inspire business and economic growth by providing African communities with
access to reliable and environmentally friendly electricity resources.
 The majority of Tanzanians uses kerosene as source of light.
However, this brings along many disadvantages such as the excessive
contribution to pollution through the CO2 emission from burning kerosene. We
provide people with high-quality solar systems by giving them loans in order to
pay for the product in installments. Hereby it is of utmost importance to
us that our African
partners are at eye-level with us and don't
receive donations but investment capital.


What you will assist us in



This campaign will enable electrifying the village Kulungwa near Dar es Salaam. Your investment will help us to provide the inhabitants with the possibility to acquire high-quality solar systems on credit. Each solar system includes a light, a torch and a mobile phone charging function. For Kulangwa ca. 50 solar systems are needed. This will provide ca. 300 people with solar energy and hence substitute 50 kerosene lamps. Eventually this will lead to a reduction of 5 tons of CO2 per year.



   Project details The solar system at stake is the so-called MB2-200 Omnivoltaic and costs ca. 50$. We will hence need 2500$ in order to acquire 50 solar systems for Kulungwa. Hereby, it is especially important to offer the solar systems on credit. You will provide us with the necessary working capital to make credits possible. The earnings of the payments in installments will go to a revolving solar fund which enables us to finance new solar systems for further households as well as to offer after-sales and technical maintenance. Additionally, 500$ will be needed for installation, distribution and training purposes. A total of 3000$ will therefore be needed for equipping Kulungwa with solar systems.


  

Our perks for you
To express our thanks for your support we want to offer you something in return. Ranging from the traditional Tanzanian music DVD to a guided tour through Tanzania, we came up with something for everyone. Experience our solar products yourself or get the change to visit us in Tanzania - it is your choice. Take a look at our perks and enjoy.




Your impact
The new solar systems in Kulungwa will lead to a reduction of 5 tons of CO2 per year - only just the beginning of many more equipped villages to come.
The credit model will enable also poor people to gain access to solar energy. With the help of your investment not only is clean solar energy brought to Tanzanians households but also new workplaces are created through the distribution of the solar systems - the basis for a sustainable economic development.







Challenges
When we give out the products on a credit basis, we see that we have very faithful customers who pay back their loan in time. However we need to pre-finance the products first which is a big challenge because there are so many people in need of solar energy. Should the crowd-funding goal not be reached, the amount so far collected will still be used for the purchase of solar systems and the subsequent distribution to Kulangwa. We will provide as many inhabitants as possible with solar energy. 



Our previous projects
We built up a solar training center, the Simba Solar Village, in which we train solar entrepreneurs and technicians in how to sell and install solar energy products to the rural villages in Tanzania.





Who we are
The campaign's project sponsor is SolarGrid Tanzania Ltd.,a local Tanzanian company, which was build up with the support of African Solar Rise e.V., a German non-profit organization.

<p><b>THE
BACKGROUND</b></p>
<p>The
Amazon basin is being threatened by an ever-increasing encroachment by
man.  More specific, the Amazon River and its tributaries are being
threatened by: loss of habitat due to development in and harvesting of the
forests; slash and burn agricultural practices; clearing of land for mining
purposes; introduction of exotic species for food purposes; drought; and over
fishing. Not only is the physical environment being affected, but so is the
aquatic life in the area. </p>

of the regions hardest hit by this encroachment is the Peruvian Amazon. 
Over 85% of the approximate 900 freshwater fish species of Peru are found
within the Amazon basin, with 30% found only in Peru.  Many of these fish are exported for the aquarium trade, further reducing their
numbers in the region </p>
<p>The
aquarium trade is a multimillion-dollar business for some of the poorest areas
of Peru where most other business opportunities do not exist.  In 2013,
over 400 metric tons of live aquarium fishes were exported out of the Peruvian
Amazon basin to the United States and Southeast Asia (primarily Japan) bringing
in $3.4 million.<span>  Money goes
directly into the local fishing communities, creating revenue that would
otherwise have to be sought by cutting down the forests.</span></p>

Sunspeed Enterprises is building the first 100%-renewable-energy-powered fast charging network of electric vehicle (EV) charging hubs along California's scenic, rural Highway 1 from Eureka to Malibu.
THE BACKSTORY
As a Californian, I've always loved the ocean and the beach.  After getting my Nissan Leaf, I discovered that driving to the beach required a lot of planning if I didn't want to get stuck.  That's if I could get there and back at all.  As a member of the local electric automobile club, I discovered that I'm not alone, but also that the government and business were busy building charging stations along the major highways and at workplaces.  The coast just isn't a priority.  So, I decided to do something about it.  And thus the idea of the Pacific Coast SunTrail Route was born.
Armed with the idea, I started looking at how to make it happen.  I joined forces with Ken Coker, an experienced architect and EV driver.  We started working on what to include in the hub and came up with these features:

Level-3, DC Fast Chargers (480v)
Level-2, AC Medium Speed Chargers (220v)
Accept standard credit cards, as well as RFID, QR code, and cell phone payments.
Compatible with multiple connectors - CHAdeMO and SAE
Security
24/7 access
Renewable energy supply, and ultimately emission free energy.
Located at unique and enjoyable destination sites along the route which offer something to do (i.e. inns, restaurants, resorts, towns, etc.)

These stations would be the ""champagne"" model of EV charging stations.
OUR FIRST LOCATION - Point Reyes Station
Point Reyes Station is located some 25 miles north of the golden gate bridge in western Marin County on Highway 1.

We've leased office space in the old Livery Stable in Point Reyes Station and plan to open our first Charging Hub in the parking spaces right outside the doors.  The video above shows where to eat and drink nearby, places to refresh while recharging.
There are quite a few places to eat and drink within walking distance of our Charging Hub.  Here's a list with links to their websites where available.



Tomales Bay Foods - Cowgirl Creamery and Cantina, for cheese tours and deli.  

Pine Cone Diner - Open breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Breakfast is a specialty.
Bovine Bakery - Organic coffee and fresh organic, handmade pastries.

The Plan
To start, we plan to install a single Level-2 charger and 20Kw Level-3 Charger with CHAdeMO connector which can charge a Leaf to 80% in less than an hour.  Phase II would replace this Fast Charger with a more powerful one that could charge a Leaf in less than 20 minutes and would have both CHAdeMO and SAE Combo connectors.  Phase III would add more chargers.  
Phase I of the project (Goal of $30k)



Level-3 DC Fast Charging (480V) 20Kw Single CHAdeMO Connector 
Level-2 AC Medium Speed Charging (240V) SAE J-1772 Connector
Accepts Standard Credit Cards, Greenlots RFID cards, QR code payment, and phone payments
Lights
Security

Phase II of the project (Stretch goal of $50k)



Upgrade the Level-3 DC Fast Charger to 50Kw Dual CHAdeMo/SAE connectors.
Phase III of the project ( Stretch goal of $90k)




Add a 2nd Level-3 DC Fast Charger with 50Kw Dual CHAdeMo/SAE connectors
Add up to 3 Level-2 AC Medium Speed Chargers



Risks and challenges

This is a construction project, so there is always the risk of schedule delays. These could be late deliveries, installation issues, weather, and inspection delays. For Phase II, supply of the SAE DC Fast Charging connector may cause delays.
Financing for Phase II and III are stretch goals of this project. Without reaching the stretch goal, installation of Phase II and III will be delayed until enough revenue is generated to cover the upgrade cost.



Other Ways You Can Help
Electric Vehicles are the cars of the future and Sunspeed Enterprises is adding another piece of the puzzle to complete the transition from gas cars to electric cars, the way electric lightbulbs eventually replaced gas lamps.  Whether you decide donate or not, you can help in many ways:

Tell your friends that Sunspeed Enterprises is building a fast charging network on California's coast.  They could drive an electric car and not get stranded.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We live and work near the precious mangrove ecosystems at the coast of
Kenya. From various researches and our experience we know that our fishermen
and many other local people are completely dependent on the mangroves. That´s
why, we have dedicated decades of our work to mangrove forest conservation and
livelihood creation with increasing success. In a long term we are succeeding. One
of the things we pioneer at the coast is marine aquaculture, which we call
Mariculture. We grow sea fish and other sea creatures such as prawns and crabs
in marine fish ponds. This is to help the fishermen to have their own food
source in case they come home from the sea empty handed. But this is not
helping us to maintain the populations of sea animals at healthy levels.
Overfishing, inadequate marine protection, unsustainable fishing methods or
pollution are all contributing to the depletion of the natural fish stock and
are damaging the ocean. The fish (at their juvenile stage), which the fishermen
grow in their fish ponds are also obtained directly from the sea (trapped in
nets in shallow waters). </p>

<p>I am a performance artist, theater-maker, and writer based in both Orlando, FL and New York, NY.

<p>I am ecstatic to receive a fellowship at the <i>Nature, Art, &amp; Habitat</i> Research Center in Val Taleggio, Italy. I am invited to Sottochiesa this June to ""explore ways to build dynamic relationships between the Valley’s ecological resources, socio-cultural practices, and the built environment."" The topic this year is Grasses and Pastures: Imagining a Regenerative Economy of Cheese. This fellowship is an amazing opportunity to not only explore what is the best future iteration of the northern Italian cheese economy, but also to practice tackling the universal question, how can we transition our systems towards wisdom and sustainability for the health and prosperity of all involved? </p>
<p>This work is important to me because the way most of our economies run now is not regenerative. Our unsustainable resource extraction is contributing to deforestation, holes in the ozone layer, polluted waters, excess CO2 in the atmosphere, and other havoc. It is urgent that we transform our systems, and what better way to test these ideas than through art? We can experience alternative ecologies through theater and public art, and imagine how we can improve our world. I hope to transfer whatever I learn in Italy to another project and then another, to keep tackling this issue that affects us all.

<p>Through my project, I propose to build on my recent collective work. In the original musical, Aniima Mundii, myself and eight other artists of various disciplines engaged in physical labs and historical research, in order to explore how the animals we fear may move through our increasingly polluted, shared Earth. Our work consisted in building anatomical and environmental containers in which to embody our animals on stage. While I understand that I cannot become a coyote, I recognize that they straddle the fence between ""the environment"" and we humans, and as such they face invasion of their territories by human waste just as we do. Aniima Mundii explored how and to what extent we can intersect the personal with the environmental, which we often feel so disconnected from. “The stronger we can make that connection between ourselves and the earth, the more intuitively we can start respecting the planet without it seeming so cosmically out of reach,” said my great director, Oliver De Mers. </p>
<p>In <i>Transmotions</i>, we practiced deep listening to environmental stimuli through improvised movement, responsive movement, solo movement, and group movement. Our incredible curator, Jacqueline Brockel, practiced painting the impossible (a moving body), and then we movement artists re-embodied our painted landscapes through choreographed scores. The end result in this process was six canvas landscape paintings, enlivened on stage by the bodies that inspired the paintings.</p>
<p>The hurdles of these projects were time and money, of course. There was also the awkwardness, at times funny and at times frustrating, of trying to capture something that can’t be captured, and of trying to embody a two-dimensional thing in a three-dimensional physical body. I am excited by these fruitful limits because they produce more questions and maybe helpful systems of thought along the way. When hiccups arise, reach out to others. Share what you have even if you don’t feel ready, because the exchange is important. These are mantras I continue to learn through collaborative art, and they are also foundational tools for building a healthier world.  </p>

</div></div>","The Jetlagged: divers, filmmakers, conservationistsThe Jetlagged travel around the world and film adventures over and under water. They focus on scuba diving, but don't exclude the ocean & beach lifestyle from their dynamic films that appeal with quick cuts, slow motion shots, time-lapses, light reflexion effects and modern soundtracks. They inspire young people to go out and explore the world and the oceans themselves, and create awareness for the fragility of the amazing underwater world. On their travels all over the world, The Jetlagged experience up close how the oceans and its inhabitants are in danger, how they are facing tremendous problems like overfishing & destructive fishing methods, pollution, acidification and global warming. But without healthy oceans, life on planet Earth cannot exist. With this campaign, The Jetlagged want to make a direct impact by helping damaged reefs to regenerate and become again a healthy ecosystem for many generations of reef fish, turtles, sharks and all kinds of marine animals.You can help us help Indonesias's reefsThe 3 Gili islands, Trawangan, Meno and Air, situated off the coast of Lombok, Indonesia, are a laid-back and popular travel destination for surfers, backpackers and scuba divers. Global warming and a strong El Niño did a lot of damage to the surrounding reefs, which are home to hundreds of reef fish species, turtles, reef sharks and bumphead parrot fish. Small critters like seahorses and different kinds of shrimp find a habitat here and occasionally even manta rays and whale sharks swim by. The Jetlagged want to help protect and regenerate the fragile and amazing underwater world by installing a new artifical BioRock reef on Gili Trawangan in September 2014, in cooperation with Gili Eco Trust and Manta Dive Gili Trawangan. What is a BioRock articial reef?
BioRocks are large submerged metal frames on the sea floor with a low voltage current running through the whole structure. Divers attach coral fragments to the frame. Hard and soft corals, sponges, tunicates, etc. are observed to grow on BioRocks faster than in natural conditions, hard corals 2-6 times faster! The shape of the BioRock also provides great hiding places for juvenile fish and other marine animals.  
The Jetlagged are raising money to build a new artificial reef in the shape of their logo, a paper plane, which will be submerged in the waters around Gili Trawangan in September 2014. 
This is your chance to participate in ocean conservation: build your own reef, the new home for many marine species. In the near future, you can travel there yourself and dive/snorkel on the reef you helped building!  

The Jetlagged in cooperation with Manta Dive Gili Trawangan will post pictures and updates about coral growth and development of the new reef regularly on the  internet.

Electricity lets corals grow up to 6 times fasterBioRock artifical reefs consist of metal structures that are placed on the ocean floor and have a low voltage current applied to them (safe to humans and all marine organisms). This initiates an electrolytic reaction in which the structure is being covered with calcium carbonate and magnesium hydroxide which was before diluted in the surrounding sea water. When divers attach coral fragments to the metal frame, the corals bond to that mineral substrate and start to grow at extraordinary rates, hard corals for example 2-6 times faster than in natural conditions.Dependent on the shape of the BioRock, large numbers of fish, especially juveniles, start populating the structures as they provide great hiding places. The shape of the paper plane structure will create a large cavernous area, where a lot of marine animals can hide. BioRock reefs are also great wave-breakers and have turned severely eroding beaches into 15 meters of beach growth in a few years. Strong partners: Gili Eco Trust & Manta Dive Gili TrawanganWith the money raised, The Jetlagged will work together with Gili Eco Trust and dive center Manta Dive Gili Trawangan to build a new BioRock artifical reef.The Gili Eco Trust was founded in 2000 by the dive shops on the Gili islands. In 2004 they imported the BioRock technology in Gili islands and launched a Coral Reefs Restoration Program with amazing success to regenerate and protect the reefs areound the Gili islands. The Jetlagged and Manta Dive Gili Trawangan will dive on the BioRock and transplant coral fragments to the new reef structure.www.giliecotrust.com  |  www.manta-dive.comFinancing & how to build a BioRock3,300 $ are needed to

</div></div>","Our StoryIn June of 2011, a team of four cyclists will ride across America to share the Alabamboo story. The Alabamboo initiative is a growing movement to bring sustainable bamboo production to Alabama, thus strengthening the economic and social fabric of the rural south.
We will converge in Greensboro, Alabama and build bicycles from Alabama-grown bamboo. We will then pedal west for two months, stopping at various locations to shed light on Alabamboo, sustainability, alternative transportation, and the benefits of bamboo all in the hopes of shaping a positive future.

The ImpactWe are planning to build a workshop in Greensboro, Alabama that will be the future home for building Common Cycles. This facility will create jobs and empower local residents with access to affordable and sustainable transportation options. The bamboo bike facility and cross-country bike ride is a small part of what Alabamboo is aiming to accomplish. We've partnered with Marsha Folsom, wife of former Alabama Governor Jim Folsom, to develop this ride as one part of a much larger bamboo initiative. Marsha is helping lead a movement to have bamboo grown as a sustainable agricultural crop in Alabama in partnership with Washington-based Booshoot Gardens. Booshoot has developed technology to produce bamboo tissue culture for propagating bamboo rapidly at a large scale—and Alabama is ripe for growing it. We branded the initiative ""Alabamboo"" as the first step to making Alabama mean bamboo the way Florida means oranges, Idaho means potatoes and Maine means lobsters.






Project M, Alabamboo and Common working togetherThe Alabamboo bike ride is a joint effort between these three initiatives. Our action is a living embodiment of the power of collaboration.

ABOUT PROJECT M
Project M is a collective of designers and creative doers who develop ideas to improve the world and work together to make them happen. We’ve delivered supplies to Hurrican Katrina victims, opened a pie shop and community center in rural Alabama, built a horseshoe park in Detroit, protested in Iceland, inspired bankers in Germany, and provided clean drinking water to homes in need—just to name a few. Many of these projects have been covered by the New York Times, GOOD, Fast Company, and numerous design publications.



ABOUT ALABAMBOO
The United States is the largest importer of bamboo in the world, with no domestic, commercially available supply of its own. Our goal is that Alabamboo will one day represent the largest domestically available resource. Bamboo is a valuable and sustainable alternative for many products including textiles, wood floors, furniture, and paper products. It is also one the most efficient carbon-sequestering plants in the world. There are many misconceptions about bamboo and the truths make it more of a miracle plant than a nuisance. There is already a growing movement taking place in Alabama and we want to be a part of sharing the story.



ABOUT COMMON
COMMON is one part community, one part business prototyper, and one part collaborative brand. COMMON is a living network of creative people rapidly prototyping dozens or hundreds of progressive businesses designed to solve social problems—connected to a brand that’s community designed, community owned, and community directed. We’re confident that benefiting people, communities, society, the environment and future generations is the new advantage in business. We’re launching the COMMON CYCLES brand in support of this transition from competitive advantage to collaborative advantage.





What We NeedWith 5 core riders, we are asking for enough money to complete the construction of our team bikes and to help sustain us on our journey. We are also looking for equipment, clothing and food sponsors, places to stay during our trip, and any other ways to help make our trip and its impact legendary (like an electric support vehicle).

</p><p>The organization responsible for developing a partnership and alliance with Sustainable Energy Corp. who's TCOM technology converts oceanic plastic and debris to usable fuel has announced an official
partnership with the founder of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, Captain
Charles Moore and his foundation, Algalita Marine Research Institute. The meeting
between Tom Hirshberg, founder of COORC and Captain Charles Moore, founder of
Algalita Marine Research Institute, marked a productive and progressive step
forward in the formation of the COORC strategy to clean up the Great Pacific
Garbage Patch.</p>
<p>The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is a
massive collection of plastic debris floating within the Pacific Ocean.
Estimates of the size of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch range from 270,000
square miles to more than 5,800,000 square miles.<br/><br/>
The first campaign COORC is focused on is bringing the awareness to the world. In doing so we will be joining Captain Moore on his July 2014 research voyage to the GPGP. We will film a documentary cultivating Captain Moore's 15 years of research into one report. We are very excited to be able to invite Classrooms from around the world to log in and interact ""LIVE"" via streaming video. A ship to shore date will be set for classrooms to organize and for students to ask the onboard scientists and marine biologists questions. This voyage will consist of 6 weeks aboard Captain Moore's Research vessel. For more info on this climatic voyage see <a href=""http://www.algalita.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.algalita.org</a></p>
<p>COORC’s new relationship with the
Algalita Marine Research Institute will bring legitimacy to the efforts of its
team and further inspire the developments of COORC and theTCOM technology Sustainable Energy Corp. has demonstrated. Founder of the
Algalita Marine Research Institute, Captain Charles Moore, was the first to
bring attention to the immensity of garbage debris floating throughout the
Pacific. Captain Moore’s 1999 research showed that there were six times more
plastic in this part of the ocean than there were zooplankton that feeds ocean
life. These numbers were significantly higher than expected and shocked many
marine scientists and oceanographers.</p>
<p>The mutual partnership between
Algalita and COORC will bring about more awareness to the dire situation of
that which is ""The Great Pacific Garbage Patch"" and its negative

A <strong>tervezőgrafikus</strong> Mimma és műszaki-<strong>környezeti szakmérnök</strong> Dávid közös vállalkozása a <strong>növénydekoráció</strong>val és <strong>környezetbarát grafika</strong>i termékekkel foglalkozó <strong><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/risoplant/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">RisoPlant</a></strong>, Niki pedig a <strong>vegán, fenntartható utazás</strong>ról blogol <strong><a href=""http://instagram.com/nikikonkoly"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Fly Unbound</a></strong> néven.</p><p>Mindhárman elkötelezettek vagyunk a fenntarthatóság és <strong>környezettudatosság</strong> iránt, és igyekszünk folyamatosan tanulni, fejlődni a témában. Imádunk <strong>utazni</strong>, új helyeket felfedezni, de a túlzsúfolt látványosságok helyett sokkal jobban szeretünk lelassulni, és parkokban, botanikus kertekben időzni, helyi finomságokat kóstolni a piacon, vagy éppen kávét szürcsölni, és amennyire csak tudunk, <strong>(környezet)tudatosan fogyasztani, étkezni, létezni</strong>. </p><h3>Budapest zöld térképe</h3><p>Saját példánkból kiindulva született meg az ötlet, hogy egy <strong>ingyenes</strong>en elérhető, kézzel fogható <strong>információs, tájékoztató anyag</strong>ot hozzunk létre, ami segítheti a budapestieket és az ide látogatókat, hogy <strong>tudatosabb</strong> és <strong>fenntarthatóbb</strong> módon fogyasszanak, pihenjenek, közlekedjenek és vásároljanak. Olyan <strong>kétnyelvű térkép</strong>et készítünk, ami <strong>több zöld témakör</strong>t egyesít és ajánl: olyan helyeket, illetve programokat, amelyek a <strong>fenntarthatóság</strong>ot, az <strong>egészséges életvitel</strong>t és a <strong>hulladékok minimalizálás</strong>át tartják szem előtt.</p><p>Ezeket a következő kategóriákra bonthatjuk:</p><ul>
<li>
<strong>Kikapcsolódás:</strong> parkok, botanikus kertek, zöldövezetek</li>
<li>
<strong>Vásárlás:</strong> piacok, bioboltok, ökotudatos ajándékboltok és concept store-ok, csomagolásmentes boltok és a hulladékmentes életmódot segítő eszközöket áruló helyek   </li>
<li>
<strong>Étkezés:</strong> vegán vagy vegánbarát kínálattal rendelkező étkezdék és kávézók, melyek fenntartható megoldásokat alkalmaznak (pl. lebomló/komposztálható csomagolás, helyi termelőktől való beszerzés, biciklis szállítás</li>
<li>
<strong>Közösség:</strong> család-, kutya- és biciklibarát helyek, valamint a környezettudatos életmódot népszerűsítő közösségi terek és rendezvények</li>
<li>
<strong>Hasznos információk: </strong>szelektív gyűjtőpontok, teherbicikli kölcsönző pontok</li>
</ul><p>A térkép ugyanazzal a tartalommal <strong>két verzióban</strong>, <strong>magyar</strong> és <strong>angol</strong> nyelven is meg fog jelenni.</p><h3>A térkép felépítése</h3><p>A térkép egy A3 méretű újrahasznosított lap két oldalára lesz két színnel nyomva, a már említett rizográf technikával. Az egyik oldala egy stilizált, egyedi tervezésű Budapest-térkép lesz kis illusztrációkkal és az ajánlott helyeket jelölő pöttyökkel, a másik oldalára pedig az információk kerülnek: a helyek listája és azok leírása.</p><h3>Miért offline?</h3><p>Jogosan merülhet fel a kérdés, hogy miért nem digitális verzióban, applikációban gondolkozunk. Mivel a RisoPlant egyik fő tevékenysége a <strong>környezetbarát rizográf nyomatok</strong>, ezen keresztül merült fel a térkép ötlete is. Egyáltalán nem zárjuk ki a lehetőségét annak, hogy a jövőben a térkép applikációként is megjelenjen, de jelenleg nem ez az elsődleges cél.</p><p>Hisszük, hogy nem egy farzsebbe gyűrt paprífecni - és ezáltal papírhulladék -  lesz a térképből, hanem akár a hazatérő utazók lakásának dekorációja, hiszen a térkép az <strong>egyedi design</strong>nak köszönhetően esztétikai értéket is fog képviselni.</p><p>Ezentúl úgy érezzük, most, a digitalizáltság csúcsán, egyre nagyobb népszerűségnek örvendenek a különböző nosztalgikus, <strong>kézzel fogható, analóg megoldások</strong>, mint például a polaroid képek. Egy papír alapú térkép a méltán népszerű <strong>slow life</strong> mozgalomba is illik: sokkal hangulatosabb egy szép illusztrációt bogarászni, mint a telefonunkat nyomkodni.</p><h3>Mire használjuk az adományokat? </h3><p>Mivel a térképet <strong>ingyenesen elérhető</strong>vé szeretnék, tenni, annak megvalósításához <strong>közösségi segítség</strong>et kérünk, illetve néhány, a térképre kiválasztott vállalkozástól támogatást kapunk. A térképek előállításának költségét nettó 1.200.000 és 1.500.000 Ft (4200-5200 USD) közé becsüljük.</p><p>Ez az összeg a következőket tartalmazza:</p><ul>
<li>
<strong>Gyártási költségek:</strong> 5000 db térképhez (és a tesztnyomatokhoz) szükséges papír és festék, a RISO nyomtató üzemeltetése</li>

A tervezőgrafikus Mimma és műszaki-környezeti szakmérnök Dávid közös vállalkozása a növénydekorációval és környezetbarát grafikai termékekkel foglalkozó RisoPlant, Niki pedig a vegán, fenntartható utazásról blogol Fly Unbound néven.Mindhárman elkötelezettek vagyunk a fenntarthatóság és környezettudatosság iránt, és igyekszünk folyamatosan tanulni, fejlődni a témában. Imádunk utazni, új helyeket felfedezni, de a túlzsúfolt látványosságok helyett sokkal jobban szeretünk lelassulni, és parkokban, botanikus kertekben időzni, helyi finomságokat kóstolni a piacon, vagy éppen kávét szürcsölni, és amennyire csak tudunk, (környezet)tudatosan fogyasztani, étkezni, létezni. Budapest zöld térképeSaját példánkból kiindulva született meg az ötlet, hogy egy ingyenesen elérhető, kézzel fogható információs, tájékoztató anyagot hozzunk létre, ami segítheti a budapestieket és az ide látogatókat, hogy tudatosabb és fenntarthatóbb módon fogyasszanak, pihenjenek, közlekedjenek és vásároljanak. Olyan kétnyelvű térképet készítünk, ami több zöld témakört egyesít és ajánl: olyan helyeket, illetve programokat, amelyek a fenntarthatóságot, az egészséges életvitelt és a hulladékok minimalizálását tartják szem előtt.Ezeket a következő kategóriákra bonthatjuk:

Kikapcsolódás: parkok, botanikus kertek, zöldövezetek

Vásárlás: piacok, bioboltok, ökotudatos ajándékboltok és concept store-ok, csomagolásmentes boltok és a hulladékmentes életmódot segítő eszközöket áruló helyek   

Étkezés: vegán vagy vegánbarát kínálattal rendelkező étkezdék és kávézók, melyek fenntartható megoldásokat alkalmaznak (pl. lebomló/komposztálható csomagolás, helyi termelőktől való beszerzés, biciklis szállítás

Közösség: család-, kutya- és biciklibarát helyek, valamint a környezettudatos életmódot népszerűsítő közösségi terek és rendezvények

Hasznos információk: szelektív gyűjtőpontok, teherbicikli kölcsönző pontok
A térkép ugyanazzal a tartalommal két verzióban, magyar és angol nyelven is meg fog jelenni.A térkép felépítéseA térkép egy A3 méretű újrahasznosított lap két oldalára lesz két színnel nyomva, a már említett rizográf technikával. Az egyik oldala egy stilizált, egyedi tervezésű Budapest-térkép lesz kis illusztrációkkal és az ajánlott helyeket jelölő pöttyökkel, a másik oldalára pedig az információk kerülnek: a helyek listája és azok leírása.Miért offline?Jogosan merülhet fel a kérdés, hogy miért nem digitális verzióban, applikációban gondolkozunk. Mivel a RisoPlant egyik fő tevékenysége a környezetbarát rizográf nyomatok, ezen keresztül merült fel a térkép ötlete is. Egyáltalán nem zárjuk ki a lehetőségét annak, hogy a jövőben a térkép applikációként is megjelenjen, de jelenleg nem ez az elsődleges cél.Hisszük, hogy nem egy farzsebbe gyűrt paprífecni - és ezáltal papírhulladék -  lesz a térképből, hanem akár a hazatérő utazók lakásának dekorációja, hiszen a térkép az egyedi designnak köszönhetően esztétikai értéket is fog képviselni.Ezentúl úgy érezzük, most, a digitalizáltság csúcsán, egyre nagyobb népszerűségnek örvendenek a különböző nosztalgikus, kézzel fogható, analóg megoldások, mint például a polaroid képek. Egy papír alapú térkép a méltán népszerű slow life mozgalomba is illik: sokkal hangulatosabb egy szép illusztrációt bogarászni, mint a telefonunkat nyomkodni.Mire használjuk az adományokat? Mivel a térképet ingyenesen elérhetővé szeretnék, tenni, annak megvalósításához közösségi segítséget kérünk, illetve néhány, a térképre kiválasztott vállalkozástól támogatást kapunk. A térképek előállításának költségét nettó 1.200.000 és 1.500.000 Ft (4200-5200 USD) közé becsüljük.Ez az összeg a következőket tartalmazza:

Gyártási költségek: 5000 db térképhez (és a tesztnyomatokhoz) szükséges papír és festék, a RISO nyomtató üzemeltetése

<p>Our transportation network is one of our most important resources, allowing us to access basic needs such as food, housing and employment. Yet we contribute a lot of time and money to a system that has been poorly designed and does not work well for anyone.Awareness is rapidly growing that a society dominated by cars is expensive, dangerous and unsustainable, and that we must take action to move in a new direction. We must now develop the political will to admit our mistakes and change course, making sure our actions and policies match the need to build safe, effective, interconnected, sustainable transport networks.<br/><br/>I am touring cities and towns across the US and Canada -- exclusively by bicycle or public transit -- to raise awareness of the role that sustainable transportation can and does play in supporting vibrant, livable communities. By understanding what is (and is not) working in other places we can address the challenges and opportunities to improving access and mobility anywhere. This information will help all of us be better planners, operators, advocates and activists -- ultimately improving the lives of countless others by working toward a shared vision of a safe, convenient, affordable transportation network that works for everyone.<br/><br/>I encourage you to participate in this project by sharing your experiences in the comments section, on <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/criticaltransit"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook</a> or <a href=""http://www.twitter.com/CriticalTransit"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Twitter</a>, or <a href=""http://www.criticaltransit.com/contact/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">contact me</a>, so that we can all learn from each other for the benefit of everyone.<br/><br/>Follow the tour on my blog and weekly podcast -- <a href=""http://www.criticaltransit.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.criticaltransit.com</a> -- and please share your questions and suggestions.</p>

<div> </div>
<div>Several years ago, while living in the Blue Ridge Mountains, we became aware of the environmental destruction being inflicted upon the people and the land in the coal mining areas by the coal industry: contaminated water, children endangered by slurry ponds, mountain top removal, etc. We discussed the need for a clean source of power, one that would produce enough power to make it attractive to individuals and businesses beyond the environmentally-conscious community. We created the Royal Wind.</div>
<div>The benefits of the Royal Wind include:</div>
<div>~ low capital cost</div>
<div>~short payback time</div>
<div>~high output</div>
<div>~reduced drag</div>
<div>~quiet operation and low visual impact</div>
<div>~storm-ready</div>
<div>~operates in a wide range of wind conditions, including coastal and high-wind mountain areas</div>
<div>~made of low-cost materials (when in full production a large percentage of materials will be recycled styrofoam)</div>
<div>~made in USA</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Our dream is to provide low cost, high output wind turbines to homeowners and businesses worldwide. With our turbine, many families will be able to provide for their economic futures by purchasing a Royal Wind 3.2 and selling excess electricity into the grid for decades to come. With this Indiegogo project we are seeking funding to build the forms (for which you can see the plugs in the video) for our 3.2 kW model, as well as to build and install a full-scale prototype. From this prototype installation we will be able to collect wind speed and weather condition specific data which is the first step toward getting the Royal Wind 3.2 certified as eligible for renewable energy tax credits and rebates.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We are offering preorders of the Royal Wind 3.2, $150-$3500 coupons toward the future purchase of a Royal Wind 3.2, as well as conversation-starting t-shirts, magnets and certificates of appreciation featuring the digital image you see at the top of this page. Supporters from the $250 level and up will be listed on the supporter page of our website.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We anticipate monthly output between 800-1000 kilowatt hours in average wind conditions, which is 2-3 times more than other small wind turbines of similar capacity. This make the Royal Wind an economically wise choice for business, industry, and residential use, even for those not concerned with their carbon footprint. For distributed generation scale wind power to make a significant positive environmental impact , it has to be attractive to a wider spectrum of customers. With longevity and warranty long exceeding payback time, the ability to operate in a wide range of wind conditions (which means more hours of production per day) and a storm-ready design, the Royal Wind is a renewable energy option that makes sense. The average payback time for many small-scale renewable energy sources is 20 years, before which many systems wear out. We expect our customers to have a pay back period of 3-7 years without rebates, and even shorter with rebates.</div>

The western quoll once roamed over 70% of the Australian mainland, but was extinct except for in a small pocket in south-western Western Australia.  
But in April 2014, 42 western quolls were released in the Flinders Ranges, in South Australia, where they had been missing for 130 years, as part of a groundbreaking re-introduction program. 
The western quoll has been thrown a lifeline, but it's not out of danger yet. It needs help to survive. 
In the last century, dozens of unique Australian mammals have been made extinct, and many others are perched precariously on the brink. But for the western quoll, we have this unique chance to save it, and undo some of the damage of the past.

The western quoll is being huntedThis precious colony needs to stay alive long enough for them to breed and multiply. But the large release area is unfenced, and feral foxes and cats are hunting the quolls. It is estimated that there are 15 million feral cats across Australia, each killing an average of five native animals a night. The quoll reintroduction team is battling to keep our quolls safe from these ferocious predators.

Why is this project important?

This is not just about the western quoll. Making the release area safe for the quoll will mean that it will be safe for many other native species, as well. 

Up until now, the concentration of the western quoll population in just one pocket of Australia made them vulnerable. Spreading the quoll population around is an important insurance policy for the survival of the species as a whole.

This is where we need your help

About the western quoll


The western quoll, roughly the size of a
small domestic cat, is central Australia’s largest remaining native carnivore. As a
predator at the top of the food chain, the western quoll helps safeguard the
health of the whole ecosystem. 
The decline of the western quoll has been
the result of many factors including: habitat alteration, land clearing,
bushfires, and disease. Other dangers are predation by, and competition
for food with, foxes and feral cats; being hit by motor vehicles;
illegal shooting, poisoning and trapping; accidental drowning in water tanks;
and entanglement in barbed wire fencing.

We fly for our bees!Important update: First flight and lesson on the 7th of November! Stay tuned!
We did it!!! Airborne! Details to follow soon! Thanks to you, the dream became true!


Progress:
We thank our first donators! And we feel grateful to the bee-companies which support our campaign:
-Vita (Europe) Ltd! Though their huge donation of 3000 euro does not appear at the campaign (due to PayPal problems) the money has been sent!
-ANEL Standard! The first huge contribution came from ANEL, Greece!
-Swienty! Donation from Denmark!
-Civan! Huge donation! Huge thank you!
THANK YOU!

The mission of our airclub ""Pigasos of Chalkidiki"" is to support the maintainance of honeybees and to educate people, especially young kids, about the importance of honeybees in our life. This will be obtained through a novel , inspiring idea, the ""air bee-school"".Our Airclub is located at the beautiful peninsula of Chalkidiki in Greece. One of our pilots, Dr. Alexandros Papachristoforou, owning a PhD on apiculture, intends to fly from Chalkidiki to numerous places around Greece, covering a total of 2000 miles on air, carrying an observation hive of 2000 bees next to him! At each stop he will be giving lectures at primary schools about honeybees. And he will offer short flights to students and teachers. Just imagine how impressive this experience will be for kids: watch the teacher arriving with the bees from the sky! An experience they will never forget.
            
                    

At every school we visit we will also carry honey for kids to taste and we will leave at their libraries two lovely bee-tale books (one in Greek and one in English):
                                                           ""Melifteri the honeybee"" by Dr. Fani Hatjina and                                         ""The honeybee castle"" by Dr. Asli Ozkirim


The aircraft we fly with is an ICP Savannah MXP 70. In order to make this dream come true, except from fuels (plenty of fuel!) we need service expenses, a new ballistic parachute, money for accommodation, internet facilities and much more... In simple words, we need your contribution! 
To contribute, please, select a Perk from the list on the right and make us happy by pressing the Contribute Now button.

What We Need & What You Get

The money we raise from your contribution will go on fuel, airplane's fuselage reinforcement, ballistic parachute, internet support during flight, accommodation, teaching materials and any other expenses might occur during flights. If by chance we get more money than we hope, we might use it to rent an aircraft in better condition or even buy a newer, used aircraft. If we make it, the project will continue in 2014 and 2015 and we will expand it to nearby countries.
As a reward for your support, we have a list of tempting perks such as jars of our own honey, amazing short or long-lasting flights and unforgettable visits to nearby islands! Though ultralight pilots can carry only one person as co-pilot, if you want to share this unique experience with a friend, we can operate parallel flights with two aircrafts. All you have to do is to visit us in beautiful Chalkidiki. Combine perfect flight and vacation! For you convenience, all flights are valid anytime you can until December 2015!
Note that we have the right to refuse contributions. So, companies producing products that are harmful to honeybees or to the environment are not exactly welcome (to say the least) at this campaign.

If we don't make it with crowed funding... oh, well, we'll do it anyway. With any money we have raised. At least for one trip, one place, one school and for limited miles. Not so good but so we hope for the entire project!

The Impact

We must thank honeybees for 1 in every 3 mouthfuls we eat! Bees are responsible for the pollination of numerous crops, for the maintenance of the biodiversity and for the environmental equilibrium of our planet. But their population is in decline. Bees are dying off or disappearing thanks to a still-unsolved malady called Colony Collapse disorder (CCD).

Any action designed to inform people about the importance of bees and attract the interest of public and press, is important for the recruitment of ""bee-supporters"". We intent to do both: Inform (mainly) kids and attract the interest of press about the project. Since our Dr. pilot, who is also the Vice-President of the European Professional Beekeepers Association, has published important scientific papers which have been reported by major mass media (including BBC, National Geographic, Le Monde, Telegraph, LA Times, Der Spiegel,  etc) this flight project is expected to receive great publicity. Be part of it!

<p>Have you ever thought about cashing it all in and getting out of the rat race?!</p>
<p>Well, we decided to do it! On April 28, 2013, we leave everything in LA to begin a year-long expedition, by RV, across the USA visiting low-impact organic farms and eco-villages to learn best practices in sustainable farming, construction, energy, water and waste management. We will be visiting and working on low-impact organic farms and eco-villages, educating and preparing ourselves for establishing a sustainable, low-impact, eco-retreat and training center of our own. <a href=""http://www.goodfootproject.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Good Foot Project website"">Good Foot Project</a> is our personal revolution – our immersive masters class in sustainability.  And we want to share it with everyone.</p>

<p><strong style=""font-size: 1.5em;"">Good Foot Impact</strong></p>
<p>When we tell people of our plans, most of them smile with bewilderment and a little envy and wish us well. We explain that more and more people are making similar decisions: People are turning to small-scale farming and craft businesses as a way of making a living. Intentional communities are growing every day, in every nation.  People across the planet are becoming more and more dissatisfied with the way their governments and institutions and societies operate.</p>
<p>That is why we decided to document our journey on our blog with photos, video and words - to show that change CAN happen. Change IS happening.</p>
<p>With your contribution, you can help inspire millions of people across the US and around the world to make smart changes - for themselves and the planet - RIGHT NOW.   </p>

<h3><strong>JC Jaress</strong></h3>
<p>JC Jaress is an artist. He paints, photographs and writes about things left unspoken or unnoticed, which, to him, are often more interesting than the things we talk about. He currently does this in Altadena, California, usually in the middle of the night in the company of his dog, Mattie, who does not speak much at all. Jaress once wrote an article in 45 minutes about the speed of life which was published a few days later in the Los Angeles Journal. His paintings and photographs have shown in over 70 exhibitions internationally and have made appearances on wine labels, book and CD covers, magazine illustrations. An active member of the arts community, Jaress served on the Board of Directors of the Los Angeles Art Association and as President and Chairman of the organization. Jaress readily admits to loving chocolate cake.</p>
<h3><strong>Anastasia King Jaress</strong></h3>
<p>Anastasia King Jaress is an award-winning media filmmaker and entrepreneur with hundreds of credits spanning the gamut of media platforms – from film and television, to interactive and live/ experiential. Her credits include work for Google, Ford, Chevrolet, Heineken, Red Bull, Amon Tobin, Drake, Alicia Keys, American Idol and the Marquee Nightclub in Las Vegas. In 2006, her first documentary, American Blackout – <a href=""http://www.americanblackout.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.americanblackout.com</a>, won the Sundance Film Festival Special Jury Prize among other film festival honors. The film is a controversial investigation into systematic voter disenfranchisement and the silencing of political dissent in America and has been used by dozens of political activists and civil right organizations to promote civic engagement.</p>
<h3><strong>Our Big Adventure</strong></h3>
<p>We grew up believing that if we work hard, follow the rules and play nicely with others, we will realize the American Dream – a nice house, good job, two cars and 40+ years of beachside vacations followed by an enjoyable and relaxing retirement. By most accounts, we’re more than halfway there. We own a beautiful home with a pool on a huge lot in the foothills of Los Angeles. We earn good incomes and set our own hours working mostly from home. Our free time is full of friends and family, great food, movies, music, trips, barbecues and parties. </p>
<p>We are also acutely aware that this Dream is not sustainable. Mortgage payments higher than the national median income, IRA accounts decimated by Wall Street melt-downs and food, energy and medical expenses on the rise. Each and every time we do the math the answer is the same - we will <em>never</em> be able to retire. In fact, we will have to work more, not less, the older we get. This fiscal reality, combined with our growing awareness of how our management of food, energy, water and waste are adversely affecting the planet, make it harder and harder to justify our lifestyle. We tell ourselves, ""We do our part"". Yes, we repair, reuse and recycle, we compost, we shop at the farmers market and we buy organic when we have a choice - but we know this is not enough.</p>
<p>So, rather than turning up the volume, putting our heads down, working harder and watching the months and years fly past in a soul-dulling blur, we decided to make a change.  A radical change.</p>
<p><strong>What we decided to do</strong> </p>
<p>We started thinking about how to address these challenges.  We chose to resist the gravity of familiar or comfortable choices. We challenged ourselves to let go of our pre-conceived notions of how things <em>should</em> be and we allowed for new possibilities about how things <em>might </em>be. We asked ourselves: What do we value? What do we enjoy? What is meaningful to us? How do we want to spend our days? The next five years? 20 years? The rest of our lives?</p>
<p>We aimed to create a way of life in sync with our values and driven by the labors we love. Plus, our answers had to be a part of a sustainable solution; economically, socially and environmentally. And it was far easier than we had imagined!</p>
<p>Our new life would be founded in fairness, compassion, and generosity. We love to spend our time cooking, entertaining, investing in personal growth, gardening and enjoying music, art, and community. With that in mind, we decided to build a community around a low-impact farm and retreat center – a sustainable eco-village where people will live and learn and contribute. A place to grow nourishing foods and focus on creativity, art, yoga, meditation and all of the things that make us wonderfully human.</p>
<p><strong>How we’re going about it</strong></p>
<p> We are both the type to build it without reading the instructions first, but we recognize we will need hands-on practical skills in organic farming, sustainable building, water and waste management practices and community building. JC researched a wealth of information on intentional communities, many of which seemed to have achieved what we dream of.  He also discovered WWOOF, Worldwide Opportunities on Organic Farms, an organization that helps organic farms across the globe connect with individual ""woofers"" offering their labor in exchange for training, room and board. With that, we put a plan in motion - April 2013 to April 2014 we will be living and learning at WWOOF farms, eco-villages and intentional communities across the USA. In 2014 we plan to spend a few months in Europe and several more in Central and South America before we settle down to the business of finding our own land.</p>
<p>We won't be marching in the streets or rising up in armed rebellion to overthrow any governments or regimes. We have simply done the math and choose to create a sustainable, more meaningful life for ourselves.  It is a personal revolution . . . but that's how they all start. </p></div>","CHANGE IS HAPPENING! START WHERE YOU ARE
Have you ever thought about cashing it all in and getting out of the rat race?!
Well, we decided to do it! On April 28, 2013, we leave everything in LA to begin a year-long expedition, by RV, across the USA visiting low-impact organic farms and eco-villages to learn best practices in sustainable farming, construction, energy, water and waste management. We will be visiting and working on low-impact organic farms and eco-villages, educating and preparing ourselves for establishing a sustainable, low-impact, eco-retreat and training center of our own. Good Foot Project is our personal revolution – our immersive masters class in sustainability.  And we want to share it with everyone.
We recently launched www.goodfootproject.com to document our journey, discoveries and even our mistakes. By sharing our experiences, we hope to empower people to make their own lives more sustainable. No change is too small. Everyone can start where they are! Can you help us?
We are raising money to purchase solar panels for the RV and to secure video equipment to help us make and share educational videos. Even though we have a lot on our plate with all of the changes and apprenticeship, we are committed to sharing what we learn on the road. The total cost for these items is $9,800 and every little bit makes a difference.
Here's how you can help:  First, spread the word about www.goodfootproject.com. Second, support our campaign by selecting 1 or 2 awesome perks from the list on the right!

Good Foot Impact
When we tell people of our plans, most of them smile with bewilderment and a little envy and wish us well. We explain that more and more people are making similar decisions: People are turning to small-scale farming and craft businesses as a way of making a living. Intentional communities are growing every day, in every nation.  People across the planet are becoming more and more dissatisfied with the way their governments and institutions and societies operate.
That is why we decided to document our journey on our blog with photos, video and words - to show that change CAN happen. Change IS happening.
With your contribution, you can help inspire millions of people across the US and around the world to make smart changes - for themselves and the planet - RIGHT NOW.

More About GFP and Our Big Adventure...
JC Jaress
JC Jaress is an artist. He paints, photographs and writes about things left unspoken or unnoticed, which, to him, are often more interesting than the things we talk about. He currently does this in Altadena, California, usually in the middle of the night in the company of his dog, Mattie, who does not speak much at all. Jaress once wrote an article in 45 minutes about the speed of life which was published a few days later in the Los Angeles Journal. His paintings and photographs have shown in over 70 exhibitions internationally and have made appearances on wine labels, book and CD covers, magazine illustrations. An active member of the arts community, Jaress served on the Board of Directors of the Los Angeles Art Association and as President and Chairman of the organization. Jaress readily admits to loving chocolate cake.
Anastasia King Jaress
Anastasia King Jaress is an award-winning media filmmaker and entrepreneur with hundreds of credits spanning the gamut of media platforms – from film and television, to interactive and live/ experiential. Her credits include work for Google, Ford, Chevrolet, Heineken, Red Bull, Amon Tobin, Drake, Alicia Keys, American Idol and the Marquee Nightclub in Las Vegas. In 2006, her first documentary, American Blackout – www.americanblackout.com, won the Sundance Film Festival Special Jury Prize among other film festival honors. The film is a controversial investigation into systematic voter disenfranchisement and the silencing of political dissent in America and has been used by dozens of political activists and civil right organizations to promote civic engagement.
Our Big Adventure
We grew up believing that if we work hard, follow the rules and play nicely with others, we will realize the American Dream – a nice house, good job, two cars and 40+ years of beachside vacations followed by an enjoyable and relaxing retirement. By most accounts, we’re more than halfway there. We own a beautiful home with a pool on a huge lot in the foothills of Los Angeles. We earn good incomes and set our own hours working mostly from home. Our free time is full of friends and family, great food, movies, music, trips, barbecues and parties. 
We are also acutely aware that this Dream is not sustainable. Mortgage payments higher than the national median income, IRA accounts decimated by Wall Street melt-downs and food, energy and medical expenses on the rise. Each and every time we do the math the answer is the same - we will never be able to retire. In fact, we will have to work more, not less, the older we get. This fiscal reality, combined with our growing awareness of how our management of food, energy, water and waste are adversely affecting the planet, make it harder and harder to justify our lifestyle. We tell ourselves, ""We do our part"". Yes, we repair, reuse and recycle, we compost, we shop at the farmers market and we buy organic when we have a choice - but we know this is not enough.
So, rather than turning up the volume, putting our heads down, working harder and watching the months and years fly past in a soul-dulling blur, we decided to make a change.  A radical change.
What we decided to do 
We started thinking about how to address these challenges.  We chose to resist the gravity of familiar or comfortable choices. We challenged ourselves to let go of our pre-conceived notions of how things should be and we allowed for new possibilities about how things might be. We asked ourselves: What do we value? What do we enjoy? What is meaningful to us? How do we want to spend our days? The next five years? 20 years? The rest of our lives?
We aimed to create a way of life in sync with our values and driven by the labors we love. Plus, our answers had to be a part of a sustainable solution; economically, socially and environmentally. And it was far easier than we had imagined!
Our new life would be founded in fairness, compassion, and generosity. We love to spend our time cooking, entertaining, investing in personal growth, gardening and enjoying music, art, and community. With that in mind, we decided to build a community around a low-impact farm and retreat center – a sustainable eco-village where people will live and learn and contribute. A place to grow nourishing foods and focus on creativity, art, yoga, meditation and all of the things that make us wonderfully human.

<h3>Summary:</h3><p>Project Green Ball's goal is to remove tennis balls from the waste stream and provide social benefit to people in need.  We do this by collecting tennis balls from clubs, tournaments, schools, teams, associations, and individuals.  Once the balls are collected we send them to an equestrian turf manufacturer. Together, IGK Equestrian and Project Green Ball have developed an equestrian turf based on ground tennis balls.  Once we deliver 200,000 balls, the manufacturer will donate an equestrian turf to a therapeutic riding program for people with disabilities.  Our goal is to donate as many balls as possible to the manufacturer, resulting in the donation of many equestrian turfs to therapeutic riding centers. </p><h3>Accomplishments:</h3><p></p><ul>
<li>PGB has collected over 145,000 balls to date. </li>
<li>PGB is the largest recycler of tennis balls in the United States</li>
<li>PGB facilitated the donation of an equestrian turf through a UPS grant to EquiCenter. </li>
<li>Wilson Sporting Goods has gotten behind PGB and supported the shipment of nearly 40,000 balls.  <br/>
</li>
<li>PGB currently has 62 organizations nation wide which have donated tennis balls and hosted 20 collection bins.</li>
<li>PGB has 8 volunteers and 4 ambassadors.</li>
<li>PGB has won 4 grants totaling in $3,500 and 2 awards, including a MassRecycle Innovation Award.</li>
<li>PGB has filed for 501(c)(3) status.</li>
</ul><h3>Impact:</h3><p>300 million tennis balls are manufactured worldwide each year (with over 125 million used in the US) and tons of balls are discarded into landfills each year. The balls decompose very slowly and take up space in landfills, producing methane gas and contributing to global warming.  Everyone is aware of reuse applications for tennis balls<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-family: Cambria;"">—</span>bottoms of chairs and walkers and as toys for dogs.  But there is a limit to how many balls each year can be put to this purpose.  And, even if reused, ultimately these balls still remain in the waste stream and wind up in landfills.  </p><p>There was no solution to recycling tennis balls until now. Project Green Ball removes tennis balls from the waste stream by incorporating them into ball-based turfs.</p><h3>FAQs:</h3><p>Please visit our FAQ page on our website: <a href=""http://projectgreenball.org/frequently-asked-questions/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Project Green Ball FAQ</a>.</p><p></p><h3 style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Arial, sans-serif !important; font-weight: bold; line-height: 30px !important; font-size: 24px !important; letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(42, 42, 42) !important; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;"">What your donation is going to:</h3><p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; background-color: initial !important; border-width: initial; border-color: initial; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-weight: normal;"">The more funds we raise, the more balls we will receive.  All funds raised through this project will be used to support the shipment of tennis balls.

Summary:Project Green Ball's goal is to remove tennis balls from the waste stream and provide social benefit to people in need.  We do this by collecting tennis balls from clubs, tournaments, schools, teams, associations, and individuals.  Once the balls are collected we send them to an equestrian turf manufacturer. Together, IGK Equestrian and Project Green Ball have developed an equestrian turf based on ground tennis balls.  Once we deliver 200,000 balls, the manufacturer will donate an equestrian turf to a therapeutic riding program for people with disabilities.  Our goal is to donate as many balls as possible to the manufacturer, resulting in the donation of many equestrian turfs to therapeutic riding centers. Accomplishments:
PGB has collected over 145,000 balls to date. 
PGB is the largest recycler of tennis balls in the United States
PGB facilitated the donation of an equestrian turf through a UPS grant to EquiCenter. 
Wilson Sporting Goods has gotten behind PGB and supported the shipment of nearly 40,000 balls.  

PGB currently has 62 organizations nation wide which have donated tennis balls and hosted 20 collection bins.
PGB has 8 volunteers and 4 ambassadors.
PGB has won 4 grants totaling in $3,500 and 2 awards, including a MassRecycle Innovation Award.
PGB has filed for 501(c)(3) status.
Impact:300 million tennis balls are manufactured worldwide each year (with over 125 million used in the US) and tons of balls are discarded into landfills each year. The balls decompose very slowly and take up space in landfills, producing methane gas and contributing to global warming.  Everyone is aware of reuse applications for tennis balls—bottoms of chairs and walkers and as toys for dogs.  But there is a limit to how many balls each year can be put to this purpose.  And, even if reused, ultimately these balls still remain in the waste stream and wind up in landfills.  There was no solution to recycling tennis balls until now. Project Green Ball removes tennis balls from the waste stream by incorporating them into ball-based turfs.FAQs:Please visit our FAQ page on our website: Project Green Ball FAQ.What your donation is going to:The more funds we raise, the more balls we will receive.  All funds raised through this project will be used to support the shipment of tennis balls. Currently, shipping is inhibiting our success.  We constantly have people calling us from all over the world asking how they can ship their balls and whether we will be able to pay for shipping.  Shipping can be very expensive, and often times we lose donations because the donors do not have funds to ship the balls.We are aiming for $500.  If we don't reach this goal, we'll still use all of the money to ship tennis balls.  Ultimately, we are grateful for each dollar and any amount of money will significantly benefit our project. Other ways you can help:If you can't support our project financially right now, that is all right.  You can help in a number of different ways.1.

</div><p><b></b></p><p><b></b></p><p><b></b></p><h2><b>THE MAGIC OF MANTAS!</b></h2>
<p>Manta rays are
mesmerizing and mysterious gentle giants, and under the sunlit water of Maui’s
Olowalu reef is a rare aggregation site visited by over 350 of them.  Here, curious mantas come together to
socialize, mate, and have a variety of cleaner fish remove unwanted parasites. These enchanting
creatures have captured the hearts and minds of people all over the world.  And they need YOUR help.</p>
<p>Mantas possess one
of the largest brain to body ratios of any fish, rivaling that of marine
mammals, and likely responsible for their very curious nature, often prompting
them to investigate boats, divers, and snorkelers.  </p>
<p>Sadly, recent
surveys of this manta population visiting Olowalu reveal that 1 out of every 10
mantas suffer from an amputated or severely damaged cephalic fin, an important appendage
used to guide plankton into their mouth. These injuries are the result of getting
entangled in fishing line. So despite laws in Hawaii protecting manta rays from
being killed or captured, entanglement in fishing line poses a serious threat
to this population. </p>
<p>In some parts of the world, well-managed manta ray commercial dive
operations have generated millions of dollars in sustainable revenue
for small communities instead of unsustainable short-term profits from hunting
and selling manta rays to the open market. But in many parts of the world,
mantas are being hunted and harmed, and the race to protect them is
urgent.  To do this we need to better
understand their population size, range, habitat needs, and threats. And we
need YOUR help to make it happen.</p><p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h2><b>WHY MUST WE ACT
NOW?</b></h2>
<p>Manta rays take a long time to reach sexual maturity and females
only have a single pup every 2-3 years.  As a result, populations grow very slowly and can be
severely threatened by removal of just a few individuals. In many
parts of the world where manta rays are hunted directly or killed as by-catch in
fisheries, these populations have been decimated in a matter of months. </p>
<p>In these special areas around where manta ray aggregations can
be reliably observed, commercial dive operations, if properly managed, can  generate millions of dollars in
sustainable annual revenue for these communities, ones that might otherwise hunt these graceful
animals to sell on the open market for much less money. The more we can learn
about the population and habitat needs of the mantas rays here in Maui, the
more we can champion the management and protection of manta rays in other parts
of the world, and to do that we need <b>YOU</b>.</p>
<p>If we don’t act soon, manta ray numbers in these small populations may
drop beyond a point at which recovery would be possible.  In light of the many environmental changes
impacting our global ocean, this is not a problem we can afford to overlook.</p><p><br/></p>
<h2><b>WHAT
WE WILL ACHIEVE WITH <i>YOUR</i> HELP</b></h2>
<p>In
short, we will be using the funds from this Indiegogo campaign and our other
contributors to begin a three-pronged plan: enhance our manta online database, track mantas with both acoustic and satellite tags, and outreach.  The money sought through this initial funding drive will be largely devoted to purchasing and implementing both the acoustic and satellite tags.  Funding from other sources and potentially a second crowd sourcing platform will be required to complete the project in full.<br/></p>

individual animals sited mostly from a single location.  </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We want to increase public access to our database and configure it to allow the public to add data and photographs, and search for (and find matches with) animals encountered in the wild.  This will serve to greatly increase our information about where these animals are being seen and other aspects of behavior and life history and also help us meet our objective of community engagement.</span></span>

ranges, mantas can focus heavily on specific areas for the removal of
parasites, social and reproductive behaviors, and for feeding. Identifying
those critical areas can be difficult. We will use two tagging techniques; acoustic tags that emit an individual signal to receivers already installed by the University of Hawaii and satellite tags that will provide us with a more detailed picture of their habitat range and dive profiles with instantaneously accessible results.  With tag
batteries lasting over a year, much can be learned about an individual manta
ray’s preferences and better understanding of which
habitats overlap with areas of high risk for entanglement.</span>

program known as Community-Based Social Marketing (CBSM) to target, engage, and
educate local fishermen to help protect Maui’s mantas from fishing line
entanglement. CBSM is a tool that identifies obstacles impeding desired behavior and identifies and implements incentives to motivate desired behavior, a proven technique
for achieving positive change and promoting sustainable habits.</span></span>

<h2><b>WHO ARE WE?</b></h2>
<p>The
Hawaii Association for Marine Education and Research (HAMER) is a 501(c)(3)
nonprofit organization that has been conducting manta ray research in Hawaii
over the last decade. We have produced several peer-reviewed scientific
publications that describe Maui’s manta population size, its range,
demographics, reproductive habits, and threats posed by humans.  HAMER also played a key role in establishing
a law that protects manta rays in Hawaii from being killed or captured and who's research helped with the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) voting to make it illegal to trade manta rays and their parts worldwide.</p>
<p>This information
is invaluable to the scientific community when we attempt to urge lawmakers,
governments, and businesses to consider how our everyday activities impact the
world we live in and the resources we will have (or won’t) in the future.</p>

Olowalu reef is a rare aggregation site visited by over 350 of them.  Here, curious mantas come together to
socialize, mate, and have a variety of cleaner fish remove unwanted parasites. These enchanting
creatures have captured the hearts and minds of people all over the world.  And they need YOUR help.
Mantas possess one
of the largest brain to body ratios of any fish, rivaling that of marine
mammals, and likely responsible for their very curious nature, often prompting
them to investigate boats, divers, and snorkelers.  
Sadly, recent
surveys of this manta population visiting Olowalu reveal that 1 out of every 10
mantas suffer from an amputated or severely damaged cephalic fin, an important appendage
used to guide plankton into their mouth. These injuries are the result of getting
entangled in fishing line. So despite laws in Hawaii protecting manta rays from
being killed or captured, entanglement in fishing line poses a serious threat
to this population. 
In some parts of the world, well-managed manta ray commercial dive
operations have generated millions of dollars in sustainable revenue
for small communities instead of unsustainable short-term profits from hunting
and selling manta rays to the open market. But in many parts of the world,
mantas are being hunted and harmed, and the race to protect them is
urgent.  To do this we need to better
understand their population size, range, habitat needs, and threats. And we
need YOUR help to make it happen.

WHY MUST WE ACT
NOW?
Manta rays take a long time to reach sexual maturity and females
only have a single pup every 2-3 years.  As a result, populations grow very slowly and can be
severely threatened by removal of just a few individuals. In many
parts of the world where manta rays are hunted directly or killed as by-catch in
fisheries, these populations have been decimated in a matter of months. 
In these special areas around where manta ray aggregations can
be reliably observed, commercial dive operations, if properly managed, can  generate millions of dollars in
sustainable annual revenue for these communities, ones that might otherwise hunt these graceful
animals to sell on the open market for much less money. The more we can learn
about the population and habitat needs of the mantas rays here in Maui, the
more we can champion the management and protection of manta rays in other parts
of the world, and to do that we need YOU.
If we don’t act soon, manta ray numbers in these small populations may
drop beyond a point at which recovery would be possible.  In light of the many environmental changes
impacting our global ocean, this is not a problem we can afford to overlook.
WHAT
WE WILL ACHIEVE WITH YOUR HELP
In
short, we will be using the funds from this Indiegogo campaign and our other
contributors to begin a three-pronged plan: enhance our manta online database, track mantas with both acoustic and satellite tags, and outreach.  The money sought through this initial funding drive will be largely devoted to purchasing and implementing both the acoustic and satellite tags.  Funding from other sources and potentially a second crowd sourcing platform will be required to complete the project in full.

Manta Database: Our database currently contains over 330
individual animals sited mostly from a single location.  We want to increase public access to our database and configure it to allow the public to add data and photographs, and search for (and find matches with) animals encountered in the wild.  This will serve to greatly increase our information about where these animals are being seen and other aspects of behavior and life history and also help us meet our objective of community engagement.


Manta Tracking (acoustic & satellite): Within their large home
ranges, mantas can focus heavily on specific areas for the removal of
parasites, social and reproductive behaviors, and for feeding. Identifying
those critical areas can be difficult. We will use two tagging techniques; acoustic tags that emit an individual signal to receivers already installed by the University of Hawaii and satellite tags that will provide us with a more detailed picture of their habitat range and dive profiles with instantaneously accessible results.  With tag
batteries lasting over a year, much can be learned about an individual manta
ray’s preferences and better understanding of which
habitats overlap with areas of high risk for entanglement.


Community Outreach: Once we identify habitats that are frequented by Maui's mantas that are also areas subject to high fishing pressure, we will be use a proven, effective outreach
program known as Community-Based Social Marketing (CBSM) to target, engage, and
educate local fishermen to help protect Maui’s mantas from fishing line
entanglement. CBSM is a tool that identifies obstacles impeding desired behavior and identifies and implements incentives to motivate desired behavior, a proven technique
for achieving positive change and promoting sustainable habits.

  
WHO ARE WE?
The
Hawaii Association for Marine Education and Research (HAMER) is a 501(c)(3)
nonprofit organization that has been conducting manta ray research in Hawaii
over the last decade. We have produced several peer-reviewed scientific
publications that describe Maui’s manta population size, its range,
demographics, reproductive habits, and threats posed by humans.  HAMER also played a key role in establishing
a law that protects manta rays in Hawaii from being killed or captured and who's research helped with the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) voting to make it illegal to trade manta rays and their parts worldwide.
This information
is invaluable to the scientific community when we attempt to urge lawmakers,
governments, and businesses to consider how our everyday activities impact the
world we live in and the resources we will have (or won’t) in the future.

Team
HAMER (and our amazing partners in the field):
· 
Dr. Mark Deakos is the Executive Director
and founder of HAMER, and has been conducting manta ray research in Hawaii for
the past decade. During this time he has produced several peer-reviewed

developer with over twenty years’ experience that will assist us with
streamlining the database in anticipation of our online, public release.
· 
Dr. Andrea Marshall is a world-renowned
scientist from the Marine Megafauna Foundation. 
She has been featured in several major documentaries concerning manta
rays, has successfully satellite-tagged more than 80 individual mantas, and is
the author of the first-ever doctoral dissertation on manta rays. 
· 
Jonathan Whitney is a doctoral candidate
from the University of Hawaii, and is an expert in molecular ecology who will
be assisting us with acoustic tag deployment and genetic analysis.· Julie Hartup a HAMER board
member, founded the Micronesion Manta Project and is currently the Manta Trust
Project Leader for The Federated States of Micronesia and the Marianas Islands.
For her Master’s Julie is describing a new feeding behavior with her manta rays
in Guam that target fish spawning aggregations to feed on the fish eggs.  In collaboration with several other
scientists Julie is currently tagging reef manta rays in Pohnpei, Micronesia, to
look at their patterns of habitat use and home range.

Hands Around Clear Lake is a yearly Healing Ceremony and Tribal Gathering, held on the shores of Clear Lake, geographically the largest lake in California and geologically oldest lake in North America. 


The purpose of Hands Around Clear Lake is to unite the community, honor the waters, share our healing intentions, and celebrate life. The “tribe” in “tribal gathering” refers to all of us, this growing and eclectic community of people learning to live together on this land, learning to steward the sacred waters and to share in authentic community.
We come together every year in a dynamic community expression of solidarity with the lake, with each other, and our wider human family and the community of LIFE. Hands Around Clear Lake is more than a sunrise ceremony — it is a sacred gathering of free people, coming together to co-create a better world. It features art, music, networking, co-inspiring, and co-creating this shift to a more just, peaceful and joyful world.
The gathering is FREE to all.
This Indiegogo campaign is part of how we're keeping it that way.
We are also using this campaign as a way to raise funds for a group of local nonprofits who are doing excellent work in building local resilience. (Scroll down for complete list.)
With your help, Hands Around Clear Lake will be a great success this year, and for many years to come -- and we will continue to transform Lake County into a healthier, happier, and ever more sustainable hub of peace, consciousness and natural abundance.   What We Need & What You Get
The goal of this campaign is to raise $2,000. Or more : )
The first thousand will be used to cover event costs, pay our musicians, and keep Hands Around Clear Lake free for everyone.
All additional funds will go to benefit the following valuable local nonprofits: Thrive Lake County, Transition Lake County, the Time Bank of Lake County, the Lake County Community Co-Op, Lake County Community Radio (KPFZ), Public Access TV8, The House of Living Rhythm, the Lucy Moore Foundation, and the newly formed Cobb Mountain Community Radio.
We have a growing selection of excellent perks to share with you for sharing your contribution. Take a look to the right to see our offerings, ranging from CD's and sage wraps, to healing sessions and sacred gems. The best perk, however, is knowing that you're a part of this movement, this celebration, this healing transformation taking place on our lands and in our waters. 
Money represents energy, and a contribution to this campaign represents a contribution of energy, toward the healing of Clear Lake, our communities, and our entire world.

  A Little More About Hands Around Clear Lake

On Sunday, September 21, 2014, we will be gathering at Library Park in Lakeport, CA, for a sunrise blessing of the water at 7AM, followed by a full-day Resilience Festival filled with free activities and workshops, speeches, a potluck, and live music by local favorites Righteous Vibrations, Without a Net, Maggie’s Farmers, and the nationally-recognized Human Revolution.


The Resilience Festival at Hands Around Clear Lake will include several free re-skilling workshops, with neighbors teaching useful skills like natural building, organic gardening, jewelry-making and yoga.


There will be an “Open Space” meeting allowing us to self-organize into discussion and action groups, working together on the things that matter most to us — like local food security, human rights, and improving the health of our beloved Clear Lake.


There will be engaging speeches from inspirational local leaders, as well as a “People’s Mic” for you to share your passion with the community.


We are also planning Peace Program for the 4 o'clock hour, to honor that September 21 is the International Day of Peace AND the day of the largest-ever “People’s Climate March” in New York, Washington, Oakland, and all around the country.

With military conflicts raging in far-off lands, police brutality erupting throughout the US, and so many other challenges and atrocities taking place in our world nowadays, it is more important now than ever for us to stand in solidarity — with our planet, with out people, with the waters.

  Risks & Challenges

We'll be running this campaign through Sunday, October 12, 2014.

The event itself is on September 21, 2014, just three days from the launch date of this campaign. We hope this will give event attendees ample time to visit this page after the gathering to make contributions. However, it would be optimal to reach our funding goal as quickly as possible.

Please consider making a contribution to this campaign now... There really is no time like the present, and you never know what's going to happen once you navigate away from this page.

Thanks for taking the time to learn more about this cause!
: )

  Other Ways You Can Help
Some people just can't contribute money, but that doesn't mean you can't help:

You can help get the word out and make some noise about this campaign!

You can share it on your Facebook or Twitter account... but don't stop there: Tag a few friends, email this page to your coworkers, your parents, your wealthy Aunt Milly... One of the best things about Hands Around Clear Lake is that, just by existing, it is doing healing work. The more people who know about it, and who are able to send positive intention, the better.

Visit  www.handsaroundclearlake.com for more info, and also check out our Facebook Page and Event Page. Share widely and invite your friends!
Send some prayers or healing visualizations to Clear Lake, to our planet, even to your own beating heart. We really are all one, and as long as you're vibrating LOVE, you're a part of the solution. So send light! Vote our victory, as we vote yours... If you're unable to attend the gathering, you can tune in for the 7AM Sunrise Ceremony LIVE on KPFZ 88.1 FM in Lake County, and streaming free on our website, www.handsaroundclearlake.com

<p>Until the last couple of years, villagers in Mbola did not have access to a protected water source.

<p>Between 2008 and 2012, dozens of boreholes and shallow wells were constructed by the MVP.

As suspected, water scarcity was not the issue. The real issue lie in weak management and the users' lack of understanding about the value of water beyond its immediate use.</p>
<p>I am now analyzing the supply and demand of this piped water scheme to support 7-day access at each of these taps and to ensure its sustainability. But I am hoping to raise money to cover the <strong>first month’s energy cost</strong> to get us started. With an average use of 1,300,000L per month, we need roughly <strong>Tsh 600,000 (US$375)</strong> to run the pump. This will <strong>benefit 3,500 villagers</strong> who will experience the value of reliable and safe water every day. In addition, the drilling of 3 boreholes was suspended in early 2012 due to a lack of funding. Each borehole costs <strong>Tsh 9,000,000 (US$5,625)</strong> to drill and <strong>supplies entire communities</strong>.

The Impact

Ordinary people face
challenges. Climate Reality Leaders embrace them. The Climate Reality
Leadership Corps is a global network of activists committed to taking on the
climate crisis and solving the greatest threat humanity has ever faced. The
program takes great leaders and makes them exceptional, providing the training
in climate science, communications, and organizing to tell the story of climate
change and inspire communities everywhere to take action. The result is a
dynamic group of world-changers shaping the conversation on climate in forums
from family dinners to international summits and building a 21st-century
movement for solutions. I am just one step away from achieving all these but
for the fund crisis.




I have already taken
several actions in a bid to protect the environment. As a journalist and
columnist, I will write, tell stories and engage in mass communication about global
climate movement. Using my experience from the summit I'll be able to inspire
action among the local communities. From the journalistic point of view,
this training will help me understand the existing policy framework on climate
change that is in practice and what has been so far. I will write about
the issues in my country's media as well as international communities and
inspire others to take action. The summit will be an opportunity for me to
refine my skills, share knowledge, build a network with people and communities
globally. I will use these skills to build movements involving people
and communities to tackle the climate crisis.
Within a year of completing the training with the Climate Reality
Leadership Corps I will be required to perform ten Acts of Leadership, which
come in a variety of forms and will involve my local community. It may include
giving a presentation, writing a blog, writing a letter to the editor,
organising a film screening, organising a climate change-related campaign,
meeting with local, state or national leaders and organising a day of action. I
will be required to take action.

<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
<p>The agricultural potential of the region of La Mixteca Alta is limited by its arid climate. Agricultural practices in the region since the second half of the twentieth century have exacerbated this problem, leading to poor soil conditions and limited productivity. For this reason, few community members can fully support themselves through agriculture alone. Many must seek work as transient laborers in nearby cities.</p>
<p>This project delineates a sustainable agriculture and water management program to be implemented in the region. The project focuses on transfer of knowledge while working in cooperation with local communities to develop and build best water management and agricultural solutions. These solutions include simple technologies such as rainwater harvesting and drip irrigation, and more complex solutions, like bio-drainage and wind-powered water pumping. All systems and devices will be constructed locally, utilizing local materials and labor.</p>
<p><br/> In the short term, the goal of this project is to develop solutions to current water management and agricultural issues and, through the implementation of these solutions to actively transfer practical knowledge to the communities. In the long term, the project aims to establish a platform where program members can continue to collaborate with the local community and NGOs, thereby cultivating rural water management and agriculture best practices in the region.</p>
<p><br/><strong>General Information and Current Conditions</strong></p>
<p> San Miguel Huautla is located in the Mixteca Alta region, in the state of Oaxaca, in Southern Mexico. It covers an area of about 36 square miles located at 17° 44’ latitude north and 97o 08’ longitude west. The community is 53 miles northeast of Oaxaca de Juárez and 20 miles northwest of Asunción Nochixtlán. The region is mountainous, with elevations ranging from 1800 to 2800 meters and characterized by steep slopes and escarpments. The landscape is marked by ridges, fissures, sinkholes and other features.</p>
<p> At higher altitudes the climate is temperate sub-humid with an average temperature of 18 degrees Celsius and little seasonal variation. The climate at lower altitudes is temperate semiarid. Rainfall ranges from 600 to 800 mm annually, falling primarily in the summer, June through October. Less than 5% of the annual precipitation occurs in the winter, November through May.</p>
<p> Two different agricultural practices are common in the region. During the summer months, rain-fed agriculture predominates. During the dry winter months, dry farming techniques are used to produce crops such as corn, wheat, and oats that have lower water requirements. Use of this technique enables communities in the region to maximize their production capacity by utilizing the moisture retained in the soil from the rainy months. When used, the most common irrigation method is flood irrigation.</p>
<p> Current agricultural practices in the region are constrained by lack of resources and technology. Most members of the communities are subsistence farmers, with families managing their own land plots without modern equipment, sometimes relying on the assistance of neighbors. Most farming techniques are passed on generation to generation and community members do not have sufficient access to new techniques and methods.</p>
<p> Income from activities within the community only partially covers the basic needs. During months of low agricultural productivity, heads of the household emigrate to look for jobs outside of the region, primarily to the cities of Oaxaca, Puebla, Nochixtlan, or Mexico City. This emigration brings most of the earnings into the community. Women stay in the community to take care of the household during this period.</p>
<p> San Miguel Huautla is favorably located within the regional watershed. A number of springs exist in the area, and are largely used as sources of gravity-driven water system for household consumption and agriculture purposes. In 2010, approximately half of the homes had direct access to water.</p>
<p> Approximately 80% of the homes currently have electrical energy through access to an energy distribution system. Current projects are expanding this network to include all of the homes in the community. Most homes have latrines or dry latrines, with a minority also having septic tanks. A health office is located in the center of town. Approximately 70% of the community is literate. Of the 30% of the community that is not literate, 70% are women and 30% are men.</p>
<p> The region of La Mixteca Alta is currently served by CEDICAM (CENTRO DE DESAROLLO CAMPESINO),  a local non-profit organization. CEDICAM currently engages communities in the region in an effort to create a holistic program for municipal development through improvements in agriculture. This organization will be a participant in this project, and their role will be discussed further below.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1>Methodology</h1>
<p> The Sustainable Agriculture in Mexico (SAM) Project consists of three phases. In the first phase, technical and community assessments were made. Based on data collected during the assessment, a number of recommended measures were developed to quantifiably improve the agricultural output of the region. In the second phase, these measures are implemented as recommended in this report, with priority based on the results of the report and community interest. In the third phase, success of the various implementations is measured and verified, and next steps are determined. If necessary, this will lead back to the first phase of the project.</p>
<p> The first phase of the project, currently in progress, consists of the following steps. Potential measures were evaluated after the site survey and related research. A physical survey conducted in January, 2013 included soil and water tests, as well as notation of topographical features, with locations of interest marked with a GPS system. Community focus groups were conducted to develop an understanding of cultural practices and community priorities.</p>
<p> The site survey was supplemented and informed by the research conducted through two means. Most importantly, through direct interviews and discussions with local NGOs and educational centers, a solid understanding of the region was developed. In addition, previous documentation by and conversations with these individuals were used to provide a more well-rounded description of the state of the environment and current projects in development in the region.</p>
<p> Additionally, general research was done on the various measures that was considered for the project. Current best practices in similar environments were considered, and all options that fit within the technological capacity of the region were investigated.</p>
<p> Based on the information gathered through this system, a series of measures were developed to address specific issues within the community. These measures were evaluated in terms of the cost of installation, the ease of maintenance, the community’s interest, the projected improvement in crop output, and possible negative impacts.</p>
<p> For each measure, feasibility and cost effectiveness were determined based on this evaluation. Measures were labeled either recommended or not recommended based on the results, and were prioritized.</p>
<p> In addition to measuring the impact on the community and the feasibility of the measures, environmental impact was considered. Potential negative impacts of each measure were considered, and details on necessary preventative education were determined. In cases where the negative impact or risk of failure was considered too high, the measures were not recommended.</p>
<p> A system to measure and verify the effectiveness of each measure is also described in the assessment report. Since it is essential to measure the impact and prove the sustainability of each measure after its implementation, a system for doing so was determined and was briefly described. These methods include environmental testing, technical functionality of systems and ongoing community assessments.</p>
<p> The following assumptions were made in developing this report:</p>
<ul>
<li>The local climate will remain the same into the near future.</li>
<li>Agricultural production needs will remain stable into the near future.</li>
<li>Community organizations will remain intact and available as resources.</li>
<li>Current costs provided by vendors are reasonable approximations</li>

<h1>Objectives</h1>
<p> As described above, the ultimate objective of this project is to create agricultural conditions that will support the community into the foreseeable future through the implementation of a series of solutions to current water management and agricultural issues. The objectives outlined in this section describe the scope of the project in terms of short and long term goals.</p>
<p> In the short term, rainwater catchment tanks will provide a source of water for community farms during the dry season. Drip irrigation systems will enable more efficient use of water, and increase productivity. Also, in the short term, small bio-drainage plots will alleviate water-logging issues in some parts of the community. Wind pumps will be used to bring water from natural sources to locations at higher elevations.</p>
<p>In the long term, better crop rotation and fertilization methods will lead to a gradual improvement of soil conditions. Targeted bio-drainage and crop selection will lead to a water table balance that is more conducive to agriculture and to improved soil conditions. And, most importantly, increased understanding of best agricultural and water management practices will enable the community to better manage their environment for health and productivity.</p>
<p>These objectives will allow crops to be produced year-round, bringing additional income to the region and reducing dependency on income from transient labor. This will allow families to stay together through the year and encourage the younger community members to stay in the region.</p>
<h1> </h1>
<h1>Plan of Action</h1>
<p>As described above, the objectives of this project will be accomplished in a series of phases. As each phase is completed, the details of following phases will gain further detail. In January of 2013, an initial assessment trip to the region was completed. During this trip, a number of communities in the region of La Mixteca Alta were visited. Community members were interviewed, and local conditions were evaluated. Based on the results of this trip, it was decided that San Miguel Huautla was most eligible for the initial focus of the project. This decision was based on the need of the community, the potential of the measures described above to meet those needs, and the interest of the community in engaging in the project. Also during this trip, relationships with local NGOs and institutions were developed. The team worked with CEDICAM to plan and execute site visits, and developed contacts with the Technical University of Mixteca’s Hydrological Institute (UTM) to share research on the region and technological expertise.</p>
<p>Currently, a first phase implementation plan is under development. In addition to detailed descriptions of the information found during the assessment trip in January, this document will contain in-depth evaluations of the objectives described above. Based on these assessments, a schedule for implementations will be prepared. Simpler measures that fit into the cultural values of the community, will be slotted for immediate implementation. More complex measures will be recommended for further study before implementation is begun.</p>
<p>In advance of the implementation trip, scheduled for August, a number of additional targets will be reached. Parallel to the development of the project report, an informational film is in production. In April, these two items will be used together to promote the project. The team will share details of the project in an effort to obtain both funding and implementation partners.  Concurrent to this fundraising effort, detailed implementation planning and scheduling will begin. Input from local NGOs and community leaders will be solicited and these opinions, in conjunction with the information in the project report, will be used to select measures to be implemented in August. Design and material needed for these recommendations will be further researched, and an implementation schedule will be determined based on this.</p>
<p>By June, all details for the implementation will be determined. At this point, practicalities of the trip will be finalized. Team members will then work with local community members to create a plausible schedule for material acquisition and construction. By the end of the month, a full plan for the work in August will be developed. July will be dedicated to handling any unforeseen issues.</p>
<p>The August intervention will have a number of goals. Measures that were deemed ready for implementation will be constructed. At this stage, the construction of rain water catchment systems and the installation of drip irrigation systems are seen as the most likely measures, as they provide the most benefit with the least risk and lowest capital requirements. Additionally, further assessment will be done on more technically complex measures. Currently, the team expects to do a full evaluation of the water table and to procure additional wind level research during the implementation. These activities will enable the project to continue forward with additional implementations as the project moves forward.</p>
<p>Interaction with the community will be another essential part of the first phase of the intervention. Building a fully developed relationship with community members is essential to the success of a project of this nature. By working with community members on a number of small-scale implementations, it will be possible to both strengthen this relationship and make sure that community members understand the value of the implementations, and know how to use and maintain them into the future. Also, the trust built through this collaboration will assist in laying the ground work for more complicated implementations that will follow.</p>
<p>Upon return from the first phase intervention, the team will begin work in preparing for the second phase. Higher level measures will be researched and developed based on the additional information obtained during the implementation trip. The process above will then be repeated for the new measures.</p>
<p>A key focus of the project will be on the sustainability of the systems developed. Measurement and verification will continue through periodic team monitoring trips to the country, which will overlap future implementations. Additionally, local monitoring will continue weekly as part of CEDICAM’s existing community outreach and concurrent project monitoring schedule.</p>
<p>As these monitoring visits continue, the team will develop a platform for continued, ongoing interaction between students and professionals from SAM and community and NGO members in Mexico. Through this continuing collaboration, sustainability will be assured, continued improvements will be made possible and implementation results will be measured.</p>
<p>This platform will enable a continuous transfer of knowledge between SAM and community members. Ongoing monitoring and implementations will enable sharing of ideas and experience, providing enrichment for students and professionals as well as community members.</p>

Executive Summary
The agricultural potential of the region of La Mixteca Alta is limited by its arid climate. Agricultural practices in the region since the second half of the twentieth century have exacerbated this problem, leading to poor soil conditions and limited productivity. For this reason, few community members can fully support themselves through agriculture alone. Many must seek work as transient laborers in nearby cities.
This project delineates a sustainable agriculture and water management program to be implemented in the region. The project focuses on transfer of knowledge while working in cooperation with local communities to develop and build best water management and agricultural solutions. These solutions include simple technologies such as rainwater harvesting and drip irrigation, and more complex solutions, like bio-drainage and wind-powered water pumping. All systems and devices will be constructed locally, utilizing local materials and labor.
 In the short term, the goal of this project is to develop solutions to current water management and agricultural issues and, through the implementation of these solutions to actively transfer practical knowledge to the communities. In the long term, the project aims to establish a platform where program members can continue to collaborate with the local community and NGOs, thereby cultivating rural water management and agriculture best practices in the region.
General Information and Current Conditions
 San Miguel Huautla is located in the Mixteca Alta region, in the state of Oaxaca, in Southern Mexico. It covers an area of about 36 square miles located at 17° 44’ latitude north and 97o 08’ longitude west. The community is 53 miles northeast of Oaxaca de Juárez and 20 miles northwest of Asunción Nochixtlán. The region is mountainous, with elevations ranging from 1800 to 2800 meters and characterized by steep slopes and escarpments. The landscape is marked by ridges, fissures, sinkholes and other features.
 At higher altitudes the climate is temperate sub-humid with an average temperature of 18 degrees Celsius and little seasonal variation. The climate at lower altitudes is temperate semiarid. Rainfall ranges from 600 to 800 mm annually, falling primarily in the summer, June through October. Less than 5% of the annual precipitation occurs in the winter, November through May.
 Two different agricultural practices are common in the region. During the summer months, rain-fed agriculture predominates. During the dry winter months, dry farming techniques are used to produce crops such as corn, wheat, and oats that have lower water requirements. Use of this technique enables communities in the region to maximize their production capacity by utilizing the moisture retained in the soil from the rainy months. When used, the most common irrigation method is flood irrigation.
 Current agricultural practices in the region are constrained by lack of resources and technology. Most members of the communities are subsistence farmers, with families managing their own land plots without modern equipment, sometimes relying on the assistance of neighbors. Most farming techniques are passed on generation to generation and community members do not have sufficient access to new techniques and methods.
 Income from activities within the community only partially covers the basic needs. During months of low agricultural productivity, heads of the household emigrate to look for jobs outside of the region, primarily to the cities of Oaxaca, Puebla, Nochixtlan, or Mexico City. This emigration brings most of the earnings into the community. Women stay in the community to take care of the household during this period.
 San Miguel Huautla is favorably located within the regional watershed. A number of springs exist in the area, and are largely used as sources of gravity-driven water system for household consumption and agriculture purposes. In 2010, approximately half of the homes had direct access to water.
 Approximately 80% of the homes currently have electrical energy through access to an energy distribution system. Current projects are expanding this network to include all of the homes in the community. Most homes have latrines or dry latrines, with a minority also having septic tanks. A health office is located in the center of town. Approximately 70% of the community is literate. Of the 30% of the community that is not literate, 70% are women and 30% are men.
 The region of La Mixteca Alta is currently served by CEDICAM (CENTRO DE DESAROLLO CAMPESINO),  a local non-profit organization. CEDICAM currently engages communities in the region in an effort to create a holistic program for municipal development through improvements in agriculture. This organization will be a participant in this project, and their role will be discussed further below.
 
Methodology
 The Sustainable Agriculture in Mexico (SAM) Project consists of three phases. In the first phase, technical and community assessments were made. Based on data collected during the assessment, a number of recommended measures were developed to quantifiably improve the agricultural output of the region. In the second phase, these measures are implemented as recommended in this report, with priority based on the results of the report and community interest. In the third phase, success of the various implementations is measured and verified, and next steps are determined. If necessary, this will lead back to the first phase of the project.
 The first phase of the project, currently in progress, consists of the following steps. Potential measures were evaluated after the site survey and related research. A physical survey conducted in January, 2013 included soil and water tests, as well as notation of topographical features, with locations of interest marked with a GPS system. Community focus groups were conducted to develop an understanding of cultural practices and community priorities.
 The site survey was supplemented and informed by the research conducted through two means. Most importantly, through direct interviews and discussions with local NGOs and educational centers, a solid understanding of the region was developed. In addition, previous documentation by and conversations with these individuals were used to provide a more well-rounded description of the state of the environment and current projects in development in the region.
 Additionally, general research was done on the various measures that was considered for the project. Current best practices in similar environments were considered, and all options that fit within the technological capacity of the region were investigated.
 Based on the information gathered through this system, a series of measures were developed to address specific issues within the community. These measures were evaluated in terms of the cost of installation, the ease of maintenance, the community’s interest, the projected improvement in crop output, and possible negative impacts.
 For each measure, feasibility and cost effectiveness were determined based on this evaluation. Measures were labeled either recommended or not recommended based on the results, and were prioritized.
 In addition to measuring the impact on the community and the feasibility of the measures, environmental impact was considered. Potential negative impacts of each measure were considered, and details on necessary preventative education were determined. In cases where the negative impact or risk of failure was considered too high, the measures were not recommended.
 A system to measure and verify the effectiveness of each measure is also described in the assessment report. Since it is essential to measure the impact and prove the sustainability of each measure after its implementation, a system for doing so was determined and was briefly described. These methods include environmental testing, technical functionality of systems and ongoing community assessments.
 The following assumptions were made in developing this report:

The local climate will remain the same into the near future.
Agricultural production needs will remain stable into the near future.
Community organizations will remain intact and available as resources.
Current costs provided by vendors are reasonable approximations
 
Objectives
 As described above, the ultimate objective of this project is to create agricultural conditions that will support the community into the foreseeable future through the implementation of a series of solutions to current water management and agricultural issues. The objectives outlined in this section describe the scope of the project in terms of short and long term goals.
 In the short term, rainwater catchment tanks will provide a source of water for community farms during the dry season. Drip irrigation systems will enable more efficient use of water, and increase productivity. Also, in the short term, small bio-drainage plots will alleviate water-logging issues in some parts of the community. Wind pumps will be used to bring water from natural sources to locations at higher elevations.
In the long term, better crop rotation and fertilization methods will lead to a gradual improvement of soil conditions. Targeted bio-drainage and crop selection will lead to a water table balance that is more conducive to agriculture and to improved soil conditions. And, most importantly, increased understanding of best agricultural and water management practices will enable the community to better manage their environment for health and productivity.
These objectives will allow crops to be produced year-round, bringing additional income to the region and reducing dependency on income from transient labor. This will allow families to stay together through the year and encourage the younger community members to stay in the region.
