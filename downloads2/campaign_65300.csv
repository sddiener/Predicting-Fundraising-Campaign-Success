<h2>Ellipso - The Age of Robots </h2>
<p>Ellipso is our first home robot design, where we combine <strong>state of the art robotic research and technology with very affordable pricing</strong>. We, at FRACH robotics, believe the robotic revolution will only help us, when the robots are <strong>affordable to all of society and especially to their most vulnerable parts</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>We need Your help to deliver this new and exciting technology to the World! And we want You to be the first to have access to this technology, the Age of Robots.  </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/o9z3E1zWwKE?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p> </p>
<p>Ellipso is an <strong>autonomous intelligent home robot, which is always online, listening to you and ready to execute your requests or just connect you with your loved ones.</strong>  The robot implements an animal like brain model, so it behaves almost like it is alive. Ellipso is also integrated with Google Assistant, Google Drive, Google Mail, YouTube and Microsoft Skype to let you stay in touch.</p>
<p>Ellipso design brings a <strong>large display</strong> to not only show just the robot's face, but also to <strong>show useful content on the screen, such as Google Assistant, YouTube or Skype</strong>. The robot is actively listening to all sounds and it <strong>automatically reacts to your verbal commands</strong>. Currently only English, but we will support other languages in the future.  </p>
<p>Ellipso comes with <strong>different personality profiles, faces and voices</strong>. But it is also fully customizable, if you are more on an artistic side. Ellipso remembers requests of different family members and also what happened in the past, so it <strong>behaves and provides specific feedback based on the situational and historical context</strong>.</p>
<p>Ellipso robot design includes the latest deep neural network frameworks for <strong>object and face detection to recognize you, your pets and other objects in your house</strong>. The robot uses <strong>optical recognition algorithms for understanding its location and map of your house</strong>, so it knows where is a kitchen, obstacles or a fall. Ellipso has also <strong>plenty of environmental sensors</strong> to fully understand what is happening in your house, such as people movements, sounds or alarms.  </p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>Robot Behavior</h2>
<p>The robot's role is <strong>not to replace your friends or pets, but rather to make your life easier</strong>. The robot will help you to <strong>stay in contact with your loved ones</strong> and automate tedious and boring tasks in your house.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1579436993/yeotiwzpaey8gqortvj7.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Our robot products come with these <strong>default behavior tasks so you can specifically instruct</strong> them, at home or remotely, to focus on the right job:</p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Personal companion</strong> - the robot will follow you in your house or look at you on a desk, ready to execute your commands. The robot will greet you from time to time and share the latest status with you. </li>
<li> <strong>Calling over Skype</strong> - you can ask the robot to call a person on Skype; from home or remotely. Or the robot will call you if it sees anything suspicious. </li>
<li> <strong>Search and share a message</strong> - you can remotely ask the robot to find your loved one (person or pet) in the house and deliver a message or take an action.</li>
<li> <strong>Taking a picture</strong> - ask your robot to take a picture for a memorable moment and store it in the Google Cloud.</li>
<li> <strong>Going somewhere</strong> - you can ask your robot to go to a specific room (e.g. a kitchen) and take an action there. </li>
<li> <strong>Google Assistant</strong> -  just ask the Google Assistant any tricky question you want. From weather to politics to science; or just for a joke.  </li>
<li> <strong>Youtube</strong> - you can ask your robot to play Youtube content of your choice.</li>
<li> Sharing the latest status - the robot will tell you how long you have been gone and what happened in your house in the meantime.</li>
<li> <strong>Sharing the latest weather info and news</strong> - every morning and when asked the robot will share with you the latest local weather forecast and news.</li>
<li> <strong>Teaching a foreign language</strong> -  the robot will teach you a foreign language, using simple, but effective active recall method. We start with Spanish, but more languages are coming. </li>
<li> <strong>Setting an alarm</strong> - ask your robot to wake you up when it is the right time. </li>
<li> <strong>Playing with pets</strong> - your pets can get a bit bored when they are left alone or perhaps you want to chat with them over Skype. Just ask your robot to be a messenger or entertainer. </li>
<li> <strong>Securing the property</strong> - be better safe than sorry. Our robots can watch your house for you when you are away and alarm you if they detect any suspicious sounds, movements or a human presence. Our robots store all the taken evidence in the Google Cloud and call you on Skype, so the bad guys will have a bad day whatever they do.  </li>
<li> <strong>Robot administration</strong> - creating its own map of rooms and obstacles; watching its battery status and automatically recharging when due; or just endlessly waiting for you to come back.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please do not worry if you are missing anything here. We will be <strong>releasing new functionality every 3 months</strong>. And we are going to <strong>listen to you on social media</strong> and our user forums to really understand your new requirements.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Robot Customization</h2>
<p>We, at FRACH robotics, understand that key to any successful product is a <strong>high level of customization for specific user needs and demands</strong>. <strong>We are all different and unique and therefore we require the same from our tools and gadgets</strong>. Our robotic technology supports comprehensive customization in both appearance and behavior. Our technology also supports user provided customization from our more DIY and artistically oriented customers.  </p>

<li> <strong>Robot behavior</strong> - you can customize hundreds of behavioral rules, how often the robot should interact with you or what particular activities to be temporarily disabled. </li>
<li> <strong>Face recognition</strong> - using the face recognition technology the robot is able to respond to each user with his/her own name and related history.   </li>
<li> <strong>Tyres</strong> - we will provide a rich selection of internal/outdoors tyres with different colors, so you can take your robot out on a garden and do some ""digging"".</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h2>Robot Models</h2>
<p>Our robot products come in 3 models to let our <strong>customers to choose the right tool for the job</strong>:    </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1579437368/czc8kxf3jcc9wjmhoecl.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Privacy and Security</h2>
<p>We, at FRACH robotics, consider the security and privacy as the most important functionality of our products. It is paramount that your personal data are comprehensively protected as our robots are present in your homes. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1579437557/drmgwvmw6xk8chmebd04.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Our technology use strictly only secure publicly available services from major SW providers for all robot external communication. Such as Google Android OS, Google Drive, Google Android Voice Recognition, Google Mail and  Microsoft Skype. There is no other robot communication with our company servers or any other 3rd parties. Users are also able to explicitly disable any robot interfaces such as camera or microphone for maximum privacy. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Robot App</h2>
<p> Obviously our <strong>robots will come with an app, both Google Android and Apple iOS</strong>.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1579437628/c3tfq2zcehyi5sppfg6e.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The app will enable you to connect and <strong>use your robot, when you leave your house</strong>. You can check the status of your robot, what action it is currently executing, its position in the house, see details of any security alerts and <strong>use the live Skype video/audio feed</strong>. Also it could be more comfortable to use the app to configure the robot's settings, instead of typing on the robot's screen or talking to it. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Robot Design </h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1579437746/mw85ajm4akjondat5hd3.png"" src=""""/></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>External shapes</strong> - Ellipso design is inspired by using a single geometrical shape (the ellipsoid) for the whole body and wheels, so the end result has a simple, but powerful and elegant impression.  </li>
<li>
<strong> Robot SW design</strong> - The robot's main control process is implemented as an Android long running background Service. The Service's thread cycles every 100ms and it implements integration with all external modules; such as camera, BlueTooth or Android's speech recognition API. The external modules translate their specific custom events to a generic logical language so the robotic brain model can simply analyse and command the robot based on the historical context and current events.  </li>
<li> <strong>Robot brain model</strong> -  our robot brain cortex behavioral rules model is based on the “Affordance Competition Hypothesis” research of University of Montreal. This enables the robot to behave like it is alive and us to simply add new rules and behavior with minimal impact on the current ones. The same way a child would learn new behavioral patterns. </li>

<p> </p>
<h2>Delivery Timeline</h2>
<p>It has been a long journey, but now we, at FRACH robotics, have a great and exciting technology ready to be shared with You:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1579438240/sevguqjpfn17uevdkwtk.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Total Quality Control</h2>
<p>We, at FRACH robotics, are obsessed with quality control of our products. Based on the IT industry DevOps best practices the <strong>continues multi-level testing with fully automated 24/7 regression</strong> is necessary to deliver stable, functional and long-term reliable products. Majority of the automated test cycles will run at least every 24h and each identified defect will be required to be fixed immediately.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1579438367/r0mjrck79vgciya22xj0.png"" src=""""/> </p>
<p><strong>Functional behavioral testing</strong> - unit testing of the brain behavioral rules in JVM to assure a proper sequencing and habituation of the behavioral actions; unit testing of interface modules in JVM; virtual functional testing of the assembled robot in the virtual environment; environmental functional testing in real habitats.</p>
<p><strong>None-functional electronic testing</strong> - unit testing of the off-the-shelf electronic modules (e.g. geared motors) before assembly; power consumption, endurance and self-charging testing; electronic interference testing. </p>
<p><strong>None-functional mechanical testing</strong> - unit testing of mechanical parts before assembly; mechanical functional stress, falls, vibrations and endurance testing; noise generation testing on different surfaces. </p>
<p><strong>User acceptance testing</strong> - testing the robot behavior and user interactions with small focus groups to assess simplicity, effectiveness and usability of the robot's user interfaces; both vocal and screen UIs.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Small Scale Production</h2>
<p>Small scale production of electronic gadgets has been always a concern for its high investment and operational costs. For example, the high-quality steel plastic injection molds for a small robot can easily cost upto £100000. Therefore we, at FRACH robotics, have developed the <strong>SASS (Smart Agile Small Scale)</strong> method to minimize the costs, focus on fast delivery of the business value to our customers and risk mitigation at it's core. Our SASS method covers comprehensively all aspects of design, manufacturing, testing and fulfillment and it is strongly inspired by the <strong>IT industry best practices such as Agile, DevOps and Micro-services</strong>.  </p>

</div></div>","Ellipso - The Age of Robots 
Ellipso is our first home robot design, where we combine state of the art robotic research and technology with very affordable pricing. We, at FRACH robotics, believe the robotic revolution will only help us, when the robots are affordable to all of society and especially to their most vulnerable parts. 
We need Your help to deliver this new and exciting technology to the World! And we want You to be the first to have access to this technology, the Age of Robots.  
 

 
Ellipso is an autonomous intelligent home robot, which is always online, listening to you and ready to execute your requests or just connect you with your loved ones.  The robot implements an animal like brain model, so it behaves almost like it is alive. Ellipso is also integrated with Google Assistant, Google Drive, Google Mail, YouTube and Microsoft Skype to let you stay in touch.
Ellipso design brings a large display to not only show just the robot's face, but also to show useful content on the screen, such as Google Assistant, YouTube or Skype. The robot is actively listening to all sounds and it automatically reacts to your verbal commands. Currently only English, but we will support other languages in the future.  
Ellipso comes with different personality profiles, faces and voices. But it is also fully customizable, if you are more on an artistic side. Ellipso remembers requests of different family members and also what happened in the past, so it behaves and provides specific feedback based on the situational and historical context.
Ellipso robot design includes the latest deep neural network frameworks for object and face detection to recognize you, your pets and other objects in your house. The robot uses optical recognition algorithms for understanding its location and map of your house, so it knows where is a kitchen, obstacles or a fall. Ellipso has also plenty of environmental sensors to fully understand what is happening in your house, such as people movements, sounds or alarms.  
 
Robot Behavior
The robot's role is not to replace your friends or pets, but rather to make your life easier. The robot will help you to stay in contact with your loved ones and automate tedious and boring tasks in your house.

Our robot products come with these default behavior tasks so you can specifically instruct them, at home or remotely, to focus on the right job:

 Personal companion - the robot will follow you in your house or look at you on a desk, ready to execute your commands. The robot will greet you from time to time and share the latest status with you. 
 Calling over Skype - you can ask the robot to call a person on Skype; from home or remotely. Or the robot will call you if it sees anything suspicious. 
 Search and share a message - you can remotely ask the robot to find your loved one (person or pet) in the house and deliver a message or take an action.
 Taking a picture - ask your robot to take a picture for a memorable moment and store it in the Google Cloud.
 Going somewhere - you can ask your robot to go to a specific room (e.g. a kitchen) and take an action there. 
 Google Assistant -  just ask the Google Assistant any tricky question you want. From weather to politics to science; or just for a joke.  
 Youtube - you can ask your robot to play Youtube content of your choice.
 Sharing the latest status - the robot will tell you how long you have been gone and what happened in your house in the meantime.
 Sharing the latest weather info and news - every morning and when asked the robot will share with you the latest local weather forecast and news.
 Teaching a foreign language -  the robot will teach you a foreign language, using simple, but effective active recall method. We start with Spanish, but more languages are coming. 
 Setting an alarm - ask your robot to wake you up when it is the right time. 
 Playing with pets - your pets can get a bit bored when they are left alone or perhaps you want to chat with them over Skype. Just ask your robot to be a messenger or entertainer. 
 Securing the property - be better safe than sorry. Our robots can watch your house for you when you are away and alarm you if they detect any suspicious sounds, movements or a human presence. Our robots store all the taken evidence in the Google Cloud and call you on Skype, so the bad guys will have a bad day whatever they do.  
 Robot administration - creating its own map of rooms and obstacles; watching its battery status and automatically recharging when due; or just endlessly waiting for you to come back.

Please do not worry if you are missing anything here. We will be releasing new functionality every 3 months. And we are going to listen to you on social media and our user forums to really understand your new requirements.  
 
Robot Customization
We, at FRACH robotics, understand that key to any successful product is a high level of customization for specific user needs and demands. We are all different and unique and therefore we require the same from our tools and gadgets. Our robotic technology supports comprehensive customization in both appearance and behavior. Our technology also supports user provided customization from our more DIY and artistically oriented customers.  


 Robot call name - the default robot call name is ""COMPUTER"", but feel free to change it to anything else.
 Robot personality profile customization - our robots come with plenty of different personality profiles so you can have fun every day: FRIEND, MEDIEVAL, TEENAGER, SERVANT, MILITARY, SCI-FI, ROMANTIC and obviously also your custom one. 
 Robot face customization - out of the box we provide 9 different faces for our robots, but feel welcome to upload your own creative designs.



 Robot voice -  you can chose tens of different voices, male/female speakers and different English accents. Later on our robots will also support other languages. 
 Robot behavior - you can customize hundreds of behavioral rules, how often the robot should interact with you or what particular activities to be temporarily disabled. 
 Face recognition - using the face recognition technology the robot is able to respond to each user with his/her own name and related history.   
 Tyres - we will provide a rich selection of internal/outdoors tyres with different colors, so you can take your robot out on a garden and do some ""digging"".

 
Robot Models
Our robot products come in 3 models to let our customers to choose the right tool for the job:    

 
Privacy and Security
We, at FRACH robotics, consider the security and privacy as the most important functionality of our products. It is paramount that your personal data are comprehensively protected as our robots are present in your homes. 

Our technology use strictly only secure publicly available services from major SW providers for all robot external communication. Such as Google Android OS, Google Drive, Google Android Voice Recognition, Google Mail and  Microsoft Skype. There is no other robot communication with our company servers or any other 3rd parties. Users are also able to explicitly disable any robot interfaces such as camera or microphone for maximum privacy. 
 
Robot App
 Obviously our robots will come with an app, both Google Android and Apple iOS.  

The app will enable you to connect and use your robot, when you leave your house. You can check the status of your robot, what action it is currently executing, its position in the house, see details of any security alerts and use the live Skype video/audio feed. Also it could be more comfortable to use the app to configure the robot's settings, instead of typing on the robot's screen or talking to it. 
 
Robot Design 



External shapes - Ellipso design is inspired by using a single geometrical shape (the ellipsoid) for the whole body and wheels, so the end result has a simple, but powerful and elegant impression.  

 Robot SW design - The robot's main control process is implemented as an Android long running background Service. The Service's thread cycles every 100ms and it implements integration with all external modules; such as camera, BlueTooth or Android's speech recognition API. The external modules translate their specific custom events to a generic logical language so the robotic brain model can simply analyse and command the robot based on the historical context and current events.  
 Robot brain model -  our robot brain cortex behavioral rules model is based on the “Affordance Competition Hypothesis” research of University of Montreal. This enables the robot to behave like it is alive and us to simply add new rules and behavior with minimal impact on the current ones. The same way a child would learn new behavioral patterns. 


 Robot Android AI frameworks - Google TensorFlow Lite deep neural networks for object detection (20 class yolo); Google FireBase ML framework for face/expression detection; OpenCV open sourced framework for face recognition. 

 Robot HW AI frameworks - HW accelerated Kendryte K210 deep neural network object detection and sound FFT to detect specific sound patterns (e.g. human voice or a fire alarm). 

 Robot SLAM mapping and navigation - ""Fast Semi-Direct Monocular Visual Odometry"" algorithm with IMU support to detect 3D obstacles and falls  based on research of University of Zurich; simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM) algorithm for robot's self-navigation and map generation.


 Robot HW capabilities - Android ARM quad/octa core 1300/2000 MHz CPU for high level cognitive behavior and integration with Cloud services; Kendryte K210 dual core 400/600 MHz CPU with dedicated deep neural networks HW acceleration (TensorFlow Lite) and FFT acceleration; ESP32 dual core 240 MHz CPU for Bluetooth, UART and GPIO connectivity. 
 Robot Android APIs - robot SW functionality and its behavior is tightly integrated with Android available public APIs and services. Such as Google Android Speech Recognition API; Google Android TextToSpeach API; Google Assistant and Google Youtube integration; Google Drive as Cloud based document storage; Google Mail as Cloud based communication API; Microsoft Skype as Cloud based IM service. 
 Robot sensors - 32/16/5MPx upward and 2MPx downward facing two cameras; GPS satellite position detection, two microphones with HW accelerated FFT; two 3W speakers; two Doppler radar modules for movement detection; red 5mW laser pointer, 3W RGB LED lights, 3W white LED lights, 6 DoF IMU with gyros and accelerators. 
 External connectivity - WiFi, Bluetooth, Android Cloud APIs. Our robots require only a standard Internet connectivity to access Google Mail, Google Drive and Microsoft Skype. No requirement to reconfigure your home or office WiFi routers to expose the IP ports or any other hassle. 
 SW API dependency - our robots are only dependent on publicly available free Google and Microsoft APIs. Therefore, there is no risk to the robots functionality if anything happens to our company servers.    
 Online SW updates - the robot's Android application (including its main behavioral rules and external interfaces) will be online updated every 3 months for new functionality and bug fixes; using Google Play market.   
 No monthly charges - there are no monthly or other charges for using our robots. Have a fun and enjoy the robot every day.
 Self-charging - our robots automatically monitor status of their batteries and when the charge is low the robot will automatically locate and recharge itself in a docking station. The robot can operate about 4h on a single charge when actively working; about 12h on standby with radar movement detection enabled.       
 Obstacle and voids detection - when on a table or facing down a staircase the robot will automatically detect dangerous voids (using the visual odometry algorithm) and reverse back. 
 User replaceable batteries - users can simply replace the robot's 18650 Li-ion batteries with minimal effort (2 x 2800mAh 18650 Li-ion cells). The batteries should last about 1 year if you use the robot every day.     
 4x4 all wheel drive - all wheel drive is a necessary design choice to support good locomotion across long hair carpets, floor bumps and clothing left on floor.

 Noise suppression - geared motors generated noise will be significantly reduced by 3 levels of sound insulation: geared motors rubber enclosure, rubber belt transmission to wheels and rubber tires.   

 DIY customization and hacking SDK - our robots comprehensively broadcast their status using Android Intents to support integration with the 3rd party custom applications and hacks. So you can extend the robot's behavior for your own custom actions and integrate it with your apps.

Ellipso, Barrel and Globe robots are our generic designs; Blocker (compatible with major brick play-sets), Froggy and Cubby robots are models for children; and in 2022 we want to introduce our first soft robot Gripper and also a robot drone FastAir. 

 
Delivery Timeline
It has been a long journey, but now we, at FRACH robotics, have a great and exciting technology ready to be shared with You:

 
Total Quality Control
We, at FRACH robotics, are obsessed with quality control of our products. Based on the IT industry DevOps best practices the continues multi-level testing with fully automated 24/7 regression is necessary to deliver stable, functional and long-term reliable products. Majority of the automated test cycles will run at least every 24h and each identified defect will be required to be fixed immediately.
 
Functional behavioral testing - unit testing of the brain behavioral rules in JVM to assure a proper sequencing and habituation of the behavioral actions; unit testing of interface modules in JVM; virtual functional testing of the assembled robot in the virtual environment; environmental functional testing in real habitats.
None-functional electronic testing - unit testing of the off-the-shelf electronic modules (e.g. geared motors) before assembly; power consumption, endurance and self-charging testing; electronic interference testing. 
None-functional mechanical testing - unit testing of mechanical parts before assembly; mechanical functional stress, falls, vibrations and endurance testing; noise generation testing on different surfaces. 
User acceptance testing - testing the robot behavior and user interactions with small focus groups to assess simplicity, effectiveness and usability of the robot's user interfaces; both vocal and screen UIs.
 
Small Scale Production
Small scale production of electronic gadgets has been always a concern for its high investment and operational costs. For example, the high-quality steel plastic injection molds for a small robot can easily cost upto £100000. Therefore we, at FRACH robotics, have developed the SASS (Smart Agile Small Scale) method to minimize the costs, focus on fast delivery of the business value to our customers and risk mitigation at it's core. Our SASS method covers comprehensively all aspects of design, manufacturing, testing and fulfillment and it is strongly inspired by the IT industry best practices such as Agile, DevOps and Micro-services.  
 


3D design - using inexpensive 3D CAD SW, such as FreeCAD or AUTODESK Fusion 360.

 Off-the-shelf HW design - component design based on reusing currently manufactured and easily sourced modules such as Android devices, geared motors, common DIY electronic modules, rubber transmission belts, etc. Focus on sourcing from multiple channels to minimize dependency risks and costs.   

 Off-the-shelf SW design - robot SW functionality and its behavior is tightly integrated with Android available public APIs and services. Such as Google Android speech recognition API, Google Android TextToSpeach API, Google Assistant, Google Youtube, Google Drive, Google Mail and Microsoft Skype. This design approach significantly extends robot's capabilities, but reduces the costs. 

 Rapid prototyping - using FDM 3D printers with 0.8mm nozzles for fast and 0.4 nozzles for more precise plastic parts prototyping; with PLA plastic for low environmental impact and recyclability. 

 Rapid mold patterns - using SLA/DLP 3D printers with UV resins to achieve high quality mold patterns with 50 microns resolution.

 Rubber plastic injection molds - using RTV silicone and thermoplastic PVC rubbers for inexpensive and recyclable injection molds; reinforced with fiberglass threads. 

 Aluminium plastic injection molds - using inexpensive aluminium mold production technique based on the sequence: SLA 3D printed mold pattern / rubber mold / refractory plaster mold / vacuum assisted melted aluminium mold; where the aluminium molds can be also used directly in the plastic injection molding machines. Also with the benefit of aluminium recycling.  

 Polyurethane plastics - low viscosity vacuum assisted injection molding without expensive injection molding machines for low production volumes. Adding chopped glass fibers for extra strength, durability and crack resistance.

 Outsourced plastic injection molding - renting local available capacity and using low cost aluminium molds for standard plastic injection molding for medium production volumes.

 Outsourced electronic PCB manufacturing and assembly - using online outsourced services, where a PCB is manufactured, assembled and delivered in 4 weeks. See bellow an example from our main PCB manufacturing partner; Seeed Studio.




 Self-assembling design - designing both plastic and electronic PCB parts to simplify, mechanically guide and speed up the assembly of the final product with focus on mitigation of wrong direction/parts assembly. 

 Batch assembly - using mass production techniques introduced by H. Ford to break down complex assembly processes to tens of simple assembly steps, which can be executed in batches of 100s. 

 ISO quality - quality method focused on reproducibility, where the assembler is provided with visual and video description of each simple assembly step and with all required assembly tooling. So, the assembly batch is executed in the continuously same quality and productivity. 

 SW Agile, DevOps and Micro-services - using the IT industry SW development best practices to continuously analyse, develop, test, deploy and assess business feedback in short monthly cycles. Breaking down complex SW packages to small components with defined interfaces to simplify, parallelize and de-risk the SW development. Totally automating repeatable processes, such as build, test and deploy.

 Agile delivery of the business value - iteratively deliver the latest functionality and bugfixes to the customer base every few months over the Internet.    

 Outsourced fulfillment - outsourcing fulfillment of the end product to global efficient professionals to minimize costs and environmental impact. Prefer local over global.  

 Customer feedback - support multi-channel customer feedback on social media and forums to truly understand customer wishes, desires and new trends. Involving the customer base in selection of new functionality, capabilities and products. Running small focus groups for simple and inexpensive product marketing research and product capabilities assessment. 

 Research & development - staying on the top of the latest University research and following the latest open sourced technologies from major SW companies. 

 
Prototyping
Agile delivery methods require a short iteration life-cycle of analyses, design, test, user feedback and improvement. It is necessary to innovate, test and accept/reject all parts of the design in fast and fine granular matter to maximize business value, mitigate delivery, quality and user acceptance risks and minimize the development, production and product costs. On the picture below you can see history of our prototyping cycle for last 2 years.  

 
Research & Development
We, at FRACH robotics, are fascinated with a prospect of having inexpensive humanoid robots at our homes. However to achieve this goal we need to first develop animalistic type of robot locomotion and also inexpensive and human safe robot muscles. As we are closely following the latest university research in these areas we believe we can develop our first soft-robot product (Gripper) in next 2 years. 
Utrecht University and University of British Columbia research of muscle based control with neural delay to simulate bio-mechanical constraints: 

Google DeepMind AI research of walking bi-pods using self-learning deep neural networks: 

Cornell University research of soft robotic muscles:

Harvard University research of small soft robots:

Risks and Challenges
Capital Investment - mitigated by our small scale production SASS delivery method, which enables small and medium manufactures to avoid high investment costs in tooling and machinery.
Design complexity - mitigated by using off the shelf SW , HW and mechanical modules in our designs. Significant reduction of complexity and costs and improvement of reliability and quality of our products.
Sourcing - mitigated by using off the shelf modules from multiple manufactures and sale channels to avoid single point of failure in our sourcing. Sourcing competition also significantly reduces the costs.
Quality - mitigated by continues 24/7 test automation of all aspects of functional and none functional scope. This enables 100% daily regression quality assurance and detection of any long term issues.
Privacy, security and dependency - mitigated by using only Google and Microsoft public Cloud services with no dependency or content share with FRACH robotics servers.
Product functionality - mitigated by listening to our customer base on the social media and our forums for new requirements, trends, issues and concerns. Releasing new functionality every 3 months.
 
Environmental Commitments
Long-lasting design - Reinforced plastic parts, regular online SW updates and user replaceable batteries assure our products life-span is maximized.
Reusability and recyclability - The whole product life-cycle (off-the-shelf modules, casting molds, plastic product parts and packaging) is designed with the recycling perspective within. Using recyclable and bio-degradable materials, clearly marking the part material for recycling and minimizing the waste is the key.
Sustainable materials - Carving the product design and functions around the already available off-the-shelf SW, HW and mechanical modules minimizes not just the product costs, but also the end to end environmental impact.
Environmentally friendly factories - With the small scale manufacturing in mind we have developed the SASS manufacturing method, which does not require high investment and operational costs and enables us to support local communities with local job creation.
Sustainable Distribution - Our SASS manufacturing method with focus on the local production reduces considerably the distribution environmental impact. Local manufacturing for local jobs for local communities with minimal global fulfillment logistical chains.",15.0,10,"1 Campaign

<p>Snug Energy is a home automation hub which monitors and helps control your electricity, gas and water consumption. This is made possible through the hub continuously reading consumption levels and transmitting that data (through your home Wi-Fi connection) to our cloud based platform - which then relays the real time data to your digital TV and mobile device. The hub also enables remote adjustment of your home's thermostat in response to weather conditions.</p>

 Directions
The blueprint works for all our walls. Consider if you’d like a vertical or horizontal installation.
Aligning the top right corner of the blueprint to where you would like the top right of the wall to be installed.
The A and C sections of the blueprint are for the Small Wall panel, A for vertical installation, and A and C for horizontal installation. The A, AB and C sections are for the Large Wall panel, A and AB for vertical installation and A and C for horizontal installation.
Insert one of the included pins through the upper left corner of the blueprint into the drywall to hold the left side in place.
Level the blueprint using the bubble level included by adjusting the left side up and down.
Once aligned, insert the second pin through the right upper corner.
Align the wall mounts onto the blueprint outline. 
Screw into the four corners of each wall mount.
Tear off the marked blueprint edges.
Place your N+-S wall panel onto the anchor of the wall mounts and center it.
If the panel is leveled, move on to step 13, if not, remove the bubble level from your blueprint and place on top of the wall panel.
Using the Allen key included, adjust the metal wall mount by removing the wall panel and turning the screw clockwise or counterclockwise the to lift or lower the left or right wall mounts until leveled and aligned with other wall panels.

<h3>The Pitch </h3>
<p>Pool Safe® was an idea that was dreamt up as a solution to protect kids and families from the tragedy of accidental drownings. Too many times in recent years there has been a spike in kids getting into backyard pools and falling in. Watching these stories on the nightly news and knowing the heartache this would cause the parents made me take stock and see if I could use my skills to come up with a solution to add a further layer of protection to the backyard pool. At the end of the day if Pool Safe® can save just one child's life and spare another family from the heartache of losing a child then it'll all be worth it. I'm hoping you can help get Pool Safe® to market by early 2018 and make this dream a reality. </p>
<h3>The Breakdown (Where your early contributions are going)</h3>
<p>To be honest I am unsure of the total cost to bring the final product to market but I have been given a 'ballpark' figure from the development team of $100000 as a good indicator of final development costs and initial production of 2500 units. This includes all software, hardware and manufacturing engineering, retooling of production machines, industrial design and Australian standards accreditation. The following components will be developed to full production levels should we reach the campaign goal. </p>
<ol>
<li>Silicone wristband with inbuilt proximity sensor and vibration motor<ul><li>The moulded silicone wristband will be developed with a local Australian wristband manufacturer (<a href=""http://www.aacidsolutions.com.au"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.aacidsolutions.com.au</a>) in conjunction with the development team from Genesys (<a href=""http://www.genesysdesign.com.au/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.genesysdesign.com.au/</a>). The final design will be lightweight, durable and comfortable to wear. </li></ul>
</li>
<li>Integrated, low voltage proximity pool lock and gate sensor <ul><li>The low voltage electronic lock, with incorporated electronics, solar charge and battery backup will be designed in conjunction with the wristband and Genesys to provide a proximity activated locking system. If the wristband is not within 2 metres of the gate then the electronic lock can not be opened. Also incorporated into the locking system is a sensor which will cause the wristband to vibrate if the door is opened or not correctly closed for whatever reason. </li></ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I am also investing every dollar I have to make Pool Safe® a reality which amounts to a further $25000.</p>
<h3>Perks</h3>
<p>This campaign provides contributors with access to the first Pool Safe® off the production line and the knowledge that your contribution might save a child's life. All money raised in this campaign will be used to get Pool Safe® to market. What I can guarantee you is that I will put my heart and soul into this product and will not stop until I get this product to you guys...whatever it takes!</p>
<h3>Please Help Get the Word Out!</h3>
<p>Share, share, share! Even if you can't contribute to this campaign but love the idea of Pool Safe® please tell your friends, family or anybody you think could help get Pool Safe® to market. The more people that know about Pool Safe® the more chance we have to improve pool safety and make Pool Safe® a great success story.</p>

<p>EAJY designers Eric and
Johnny were college buddies. They dreamed of having their own furniture brand
so they came to Germany to further their study and hone their skills. Along the
way their designs had been selected by 2012 and 2013 IMM Cologne [D<sup>3</sup>]
Contests. Their confidence grew and finally founded EAJY Design Studio in 2015.
Beams Chair is the first industrial style product that they put on the market.</p>

</div></div>","The Beams Chair is the first wooden I-beam chair in
the world. It is very lightweight (only 4.5kg) yet extremely strong, elegant,
and comfortable. Industrial style has been gaining popularity in recent years.
It brings an interesting touch to a living space with sharp lines and simple
form and with the appreciation of raw and rustic materials. With the Beams
Chair, transforming a space to more modern and sophisticated industrial style
becomes an easy task.Inspired by the steel I-beams of the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, the Beams Chair is made from wood I beams, which reduce the weight of the structure  while enhancing the strength of the chair.Why I-beams? It is not
a coincidence why we decided to use the I-beam as the main element in our
design. I-beams are not only one of the major elements in industrial style, but
they are also extremely strong and durable yet light-weight. Why wood? Metal is cold
and heavy; plastic is indifferent and artificial. However, wood is natural and
gives a welcoming sense of warmth.
 
Beams Chair 1.0 was
created in 2012. It was selected by the 2013 IMM Cologne [D3]
Contest, one of the most prestigious international furniture design
competitions for emerging designers in the world. At that time, the Beams Chair
was produced by Bächer Bergmann GmbH. The production process of the Beams Chair
1.0 is shown below.
 



We have taken three years to refine the design of Beams Chair with feedback from imm Cologne. Now, the Beams Chair is more comfortable and ergonomic than ever. 

MORE COMFORTABLE




Comparison between Beams Chair 1.0 & 2.0 - Small adjustments improve the experience
of Beams Chair.



MORE BEAUTIFUL















These elegant and beautiful chairs are mostly
constructed with solid wood.


QUALITY 














To achieve outstanding
quality we selected A Grade Ash from North America. Every part of Beams Chair
2.0 is precisely cut on 5-axis CNC machines. Our master craftsmen take pride in
their quality work. 
Now in the end of 2015, we have the confidence to say Beams Chair 2.0 is comfortable, beautiful, and also with high quality.







It is
easy to style your living space with Beams Chair. Here are a few examples. More
can be viewed in the gallery. 










Beams Chair will add clean lines and sophisticated feel to your living space and transform the dynamics of the interior to a modern and fluid feel. If you would like to decorate your home/office in industrial style, Beams Chair is an easy solution. Please support our campaign so we can keep producing quality furniture in industrial style for you.



EAJY designers Eric and
Johnny were college buddies. They dreamed of having their own furniture brand
so they came to Germany to further their study and hone their skills. Along the
way their designs had been selected by 2012 and 2013 IMM Cologne [D3]
Contests. Their confidence grew and finally founded EAJY Design Studio in 2015.
Beams Chair is the first industrial style product that they put on the market.

We created packages using hardware and software to make the best smart home surveillance system on the market. With our Arden,ai packages, we bundle real time person detection, animal and vehicle detection, intrusion detection and more. We also link Arden smart hubs to each television to overlay cameras once an ai rule is triggered. For example, if a person is detected on the driveway camera, Arden will instantly show the affected camera on any television in the home. Doing so autonomously allows your home to keep an eye out for welcomed and un-welcomed guests, even when you can't.</p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/DKXJIzsLYhk?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div><p></p><div>

Built using Sighthound, one of the most advanced ai sdk's on the market, Arden.ai ensure customers are always aware of whats going on around their home.

That is why we created Arden. Arden connects to any TV with an HDMI input and connects to 3rd party devices like cable boxes, AV receivers, and more. Allowing our device to overlay information, camera overlays and other content on whatever you are watching without interrupting viewing.  Arden can also interface with all your smart devices. With full Play Store access, customers can download all their favorite apps and interact with them natively on their television. This feature opens up a wide range of possibilities. Features like overlaying notifications when your smart alarm trips a sensor, to reminders on the screen when one is set using the Amazon Echo. We are also developing a way to overlay any app on  Arden unobtrusively, the same way we overlay cameras. Allowing you to control home automation platforms, individual devices and more while you watch tv.Next Gen Video Security VIDEO SURVEILLANCE OVERLAY USING ALEXAArden's home security features are unmatched. It allows users to see their surveillance cameras around the house without interrupting what they are watching. Heard a strange noise outside or just want to see a specific camera? Voice control each of your cameras by name using the Amazon echo or Google Home. Cameras display in a picture in picture window and do not block what you are watching. Each window can be resized and will display anywhere on the screen you want them to. You can also display multiple cameras simultaneously.  Allowing the system to actively track a persons movement as they move around your home.  Surveillance for the whole familyIts important to each parent that their loved ones are safe. When an Arden unit is connected to each television in the home, each family member can see whats going on around them. Now when the kids are watching cartoons, they too can see when a stranger walks on the property.

We have been working with many shipping services to try to get the best prices for global shipping and Container shipping is currently the best rate. We know it is pricey, and a big part of that is due to the weight (over 6 pounds!) of the cutting board plus the weight of the packaging. We are continuing to work with shipping companies and will change services if we find one with a better price. In the meantime, we have significantly discounted the ChopBox more than we originally planned to in order to make up for the higher shipping costs.</p><p>As a design company, we have gotten dozens of products through the production process helping third-party designers and retailers, and we’ve learned a lot about this process.

<li>What shipping service we are using?</li>
<li>Most of the rewards we have listed (except the SUPER FAST DELIVERY), will use Container shipping to ship to the destination country or city and then use the local post office or shipping services to get the ChopBox to your home. We are using Container to ship this product because it is not a small and light product, and including the packaging, it will be around 3.5kg (7.7 pounds), and the box is fairly large. We want you to have a cheapest shipping cost possible and this is how we can do that.</li>
</ul><p> </p><ul>
<li>How long does it take to ship to our place?</li>
<li>We will ship it via Container. For US residents, it will take 30 days for standard shipping. For the EU, it will take 40 days for standard shipping, plus another 3 - 5 days for local delivery to your door by local shipping services.</li>
</ul><p> </p><ul>
<li>Is there VAT, duties or fees related to shipping?</li>
<li>For container shipment order to US EU AU CA CN HK SG area, we will pay the tax.</li>
<li>Kickstarter rewards are gifts that you receive in return for your donations. They are different from ordinary sales/purchases. Our courier had worked on dozens crowdfunding projects which went smoothly through fulfillment. Under our arrangement, it won't entail additional costs for you under most circumstances. Despite that, the fact we're shipping directly from China may still impose a chance for further inspection and determination by the customs. The VAT, duties and fees vary by country. Please message us about the specifics.</li>

Will receive your Chopbox quite soon! PRODUCT REVIEW VIDEO BY SUPERBACKER @brollandboardgames  Instead of needing up to five single-use gadgets and tools in your kitchen the ChopBox combines all five into one amazing cutting board. You’ll never need to find or store smaller single-use tools like a food scale or kitchen timer again and will have more room for storage and organization in your kitchen.  Germs & Bacteria in the Kitchen Did you know that knife blocks, drawers, and even regular cutting boards harbor tons of bacteria and germs? It seems like no one talks about it, but the hidden germs in your kitchen is very real. The Doctors Eat This, Not That Daily Meal . Cooking Light, Dr. Oz, Yahoo! The revolutionary ChopBox makes sanitizing your knives and cutting surfaces easy and brings germ-free cooking to your kitchen with a built-in disinfecting UVC light in the cutting board.Here is some research from Columbia University Irving Medical Center on the efficacy of UV light on germs and bacteria:Article titled “Can UV Light Fight the Spread of Influenza?”: https://www.cuimc.columbia.edu/news/can-uv-light-fight-spread-influenzaNotable quote from this article: ​“Scientists have known for decades that broad-spectrum germicidal UV light, which has wavelengths between 200 and 400 nanometers (nm), is highly effective at killing bacteria and viruses by destroying the molecular bonds that hold their DNA together. This conventional UV light is routinely used to decontaminate surgical equipment.”Columbia University Irving Medical Center Video titled “Narrow Range of UV Safely Kills Drug-Resistant Bacteria”: ​https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSWhEubyRoYHere is an article by PhoneSoap, known for their bestselling UV light device cleaner: “How Does UV Light Kill Bacteria?”: ​https://www.phonesoap.com/blogs/news/how-does-uv-light-kill-bacteriaHere is an article from Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology News, “UV Light That is Safe for Humans but Bad for Bacteria and Viruses”: https://www.genengnews.com/topics/translational-medicine/uv-light-that-is-safe-for-humans-but- bad-for-bacteria-and-viruses/Here is a timelapse video from Sci-Inspi of UV effects on bacteria:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4qrnMlhbpE KILL 99.99% OF GERMS AND BACTERIA WITH EVERY USE.Traditional knife blocks and cutting boards with gouges and scrapes can harbor harmful bacteria and germs. But who thinks to sanitize their knife after grabbing it? Now you can place your knife in between the two cutting surfaces and activate the small but powerful 254nm UVC light to sanitize up to 3 knives at once AND both cutting surfaces at the same time! Just one minute of UVC light exposure is guaranteed to kill 99.99% of germs and bacteria.The 254nm UVC light used in the ChopBox is small and has a limited angle with only a small gap in the boards when in use. It is 100% safe for all humans to be around and near this light. The UVC light will automatically switch off when you separate the two boards or you can press the second button on the control panel to turn it off. You will receive no negative side effects from this UVC light    DOUBLE UP YOUR SPACE AND AVOID CROSS-CONTAMINATIONWith two cutting surfaces, you can switch between raw meat and seafood to other foods without ever having to worry about cross-contamination. You can also use the smaller cutting board for food scraps, as an area to store cut foods, and for transferring your chopped food to the stove.The main cutting surface is replaceable. Buy parts via Kickstarter, or You will receive a survey after the campaign is over to add on replacement parts. or form theyesco store /Amazon after the campaign.  BUILT-IN DIGITAL SCALE WEIGHS UP TO 6.6 POUNDSThe built-in scale is part of the cutting board on the left hand side. You can measure your ingredients in grams, ounces, pounds, kilogram and the scale weighs up to 6.6 pounds. Always get the exact right portion!The middle button on the control panel is used to switch between grams, ounces, pounds, kilogram with a single long-press. The scale features a tare function. To zero out the scale for a bowl or other vessel, just place the bowl on the scale and press the third (middle) button on the control panel to zero out the scale so that you're only weighing the goof, not the container.    9 - HOUR KITCHEN TIMERYour food will come out perfectly every time with our 9 -hour digital kitchen timer built-in to the ChopBox. Unlike traditional kitchen timers which can only go up to 59 minutes, the ChopBox timer has a longer readout and can be set for up to 9 hours, 59 minutes and 59 seconds, so even big meals and slow cooker meals can be set on this timer.  DUAL INSET KNIFE SHARPENERS It’s tough to remember where you put that small knife sharpener or know you’re using the honing steel type of sharpener correctly, so we made it easier than ever by putting two knife sharpeners right on the side of the cutting board. They are easily accessible and simple to use.There are two different knife sharpeners built into the ChopBox. One is made from diamond stone and the other is made of ceramic stone, so you can pick your level of sharpness.For more information on the diamond and ceramic knife sharpeners, see this from Wuesthof: https://www.wuesthof.com/international/knowledge/honing-und-sharpening/sharpening/index.jspThe sharpeners are replaceable. Buy parts via Kickstarter, or You will receive a survey after the campaign is over to add on replacement parts. or form theyesco store /Amazon after the campaign.   GROOVE FOR CATCHING RUNOFFThere is a groove surrounding the cutting surface on the larger cutting surface for catching any juices from falling off and onto your counter, clothing, or floor. Just another small feature to make this the best cutting board you’ve ever used.USE SECOND BOARD AS PRESENTATION PLATERIn addition to food preparation, this smart cutting board is a perfect food presentation platter for parties and guests! With two clean uniform surfaces, you can use it as two separate food serving surfaces or as the perfect cheese or charcuterie board with the second surface coming out from the bottom to hold cheese knives and catch any drips. THE BATTERY LASTS UP TO 30 DAYS ON A SINGLE CHARGEThe ChopBox has a large battery inside [3000 mAh] which charges quickly. With just one hour of charging you get up to 30 days of regular daily use of your smart cutting board.COMPLETELY WATERPROOF FOR EASY CLEAN UPIPX is a waterproof rating system that refers to the ability of an object to resist water. For example, IPX0 means something is not water resistant at all, such as a book. IPX2 means your object is protected from “some water drops when the device is tilted up to and including 15 degrees.” The rating goes up to IPX8, which means your object is protected even if it is dropped in over 3 feet of water and is fully waterproof.The ChopBox is rated IPX7, meaning it is fully waterproof and can withstand being in water up to 3 feet deep! We do NOT recommend putting the ChopBox in a dishwasher, as the high heat in dishwashers warp and break down all natural cutting boards over time
DURABILITY TESTED AND HIGH STRENGTH ChopBox is​ incredibly strong​!​ It holds up to 150 pounds of weight.Bamboo is completely natural and organic and is considered a “low maintenance wood,” meaning it is very hard and dense, so it keeps water out of the wood itself so it will not warp or crack as other woods can.Other woods like maple, walnut, or cherry require regular maintenance with mineral oil or beeswax to keep it from cracking and warping. Bamboo is also resistant to knife scarring, due to its hard density and is known for its durability and affordability.  
UPDATE OF CHANGED 100 % RECYCLABLE AND REPLACEABLE PARTSWe are listening to you! Because of comments and great ideas from our backers, we have made a couple of changes that will make the ChopBox even better! These changes should not delay the scheduled shipping dates and are already in process.Sustainability is a priority for our us, so to increase the lifetime of our products, we have redesigned the main cutting board to make sure some parts are replaceable.We are happy to announce that you WILL be able to purchase the following replaceable parts from either Kickstarter or from our Theyesco store on our website after the campaign is over.The following REPLACEABLE parts will be available for purchase SEPARATELY:*Main Cutting Board Surface*Knife SharpenersWe will be also creating tutorials to make the replacing process easy.Thank you to our backers for the great suggestions, we are excited to make the ChopBox even better and make it last for a lifetime.100 % RECYCLABLE AND REPLACEABLE PARTSNatural bamboo construction and easy-to-replace parts.We love the environment and want to be conscious of our environmental footprint, so the ChopBox is made out of completely recyclable bamboo and can be recycled after easily removing the internal electronic components.We also pack and ship in recyclable materials to make it easy for you to be socially conscious, too! Natural cutting boards are better for you. Sharp knives on plastic cutting boards create knicks in the plastic, which means that small pieces of plastic can and do end up in the food you are cutting.  See some of the pictures below from our molding and production process. We want to make sure we will be able to ship the ChopBox on time and have already begun the molding process before this campaign has even launched. It is now in the production stage and we can’t wait to get yours to your home.Our designer and mechanical engineer in PCBA factory

 


 
We've completed the design for manufacturing & assembly (DFMA) reviews for the product. The next step is to create the tools necessary to manufacture the different plastic parts of ChopBox. We plan to finish the whole tooling process by the end of September. We have will a trial production run in October and will be testing the product again before we do mass production. Our first batch of 2000 units will start in early November and we predict the larger production run of around 25000 -35000 units (depending on the orders from Indiegogo) will start shipping at end of November and beginning of December.Injection molding One of our top designers at The Yes Company is a skilled home chef, and as a designer and inventor, he is obsessed with efficiency and great design. He started to see smaller issues, like not being able to find the gadget he needed while cooking or having to buy and store more things to get the job done. Then he learned about the bigger problems: How many germs can live on a cutting board and on knives and the risk of cross-contamination when cutting raw meat.When sharing his story, our team went into overdrive to find a solution. If he was having these problems, there was no doubt in our minds that other home cooks were experiencing the same.So, we set out to solve every single problem he presented us with and more. In addition to solving common kitchen issues, we at The Yes Company decided to take it even further and create a smart kitchen appliance out of natural, organic materials - good for you, good for the planet, beautiful design. With a first of it’s kind bamboo-skin LED, we created a way to insert an LED backlight into bamboo without marring the gorgeous natural bamboo coloring so it blends right into the board until you’re ready to use it.We wanted to design a smart, creative, useful product to make cooking a delicious homecooked meal easier and more efficient, all while saving you time, money, and hassle. The key thing for us in the design process was to make something that was useful and had all the features you need while including the electronic components to give you the efficiency and smart capabilities. We love how the ChopBox came out and can’t wait for you to try it!Now you won’t have to buy and store a bunch of small gadgets, you can have one beautiful piece that has everything you need.  SHIPPING DETAILSMany people are asking about the high cost of shipping. We have been working with many shipping services to try to get the best prices for global shipping and Container shipping is currently the best rate. We know it is pricey, and a big part of that is due to the weight (over 6 pounds!) of the cutting board plus the weight of the packaging. We are continuing to work with shipping companies and will change services if we find one with a better price. In the meantime, we have significantly discounted the ChopBox more than we originally planned to in order to make up for the higher shipping costs.As a design company, we have gotten dozens of products through the production process helping third-party designers and retailers, and we’ve learned a lot about this process. This experience has led us to be more knowledgeable and have a better grasp on timelines. We promise to work our hardest to bring you the best possible product to you in the proposed time frame.    
What shipping service we are using?
Most of the rewards we have listed (except the SUPER FAST DELIVERY), will use Container shipping to ship to the destination country or city and then use the local post office or shipping services to get the ChopBox to your home. We are using Container to ship this product because it is not a small and light product, and including the packaging, it will be around 3.5kg (7.7 pounds), and the box is fairly large. We want you to have a cheapest shipping cost possible and this is how we can do that.
 
How long does it take to ship to our place?
We will ship it via Container. For US residents, it will take 30 days for standard shipping. For the EU, it will take 40 days for standard shipping, plus another 3 - 5 days for local delivery to your door by local shipping services.
 
Is there VAT, duties or fees related to shipping?
For container shipment order to US EU AU CA CN HK SG area, we will pay the tax.
Kickstarter rewards are gifts that you receive in return for your donations. They are different from ordinary sales/purchases. Our courier had worked on dozens crowdfunding projects which went smoothly through fulfillment. Under our arrangement, it won't entail additional costs for you under most circumstances. Despite that, the fact we're shipping directly from China may still impose a chance for further inspection and determination by the customs. The VAT, duties and fees vary by country. Please message us about the specifics.
 
What's the warranty?
We provide a 12-month warranty on Kickstarter orders, same as retail.
 
Why bamboo?
Bamboo is completely natural and organic and is considered a “low maintenance wood,” meaning it is very hard and dense, so it keeps water out of the wood itself, which also means it will not warp or crack as other woods can. Other woods like maple, walnut, or cherry require regular maintenance with mineral oil or beeswax to keep it from cracking and warping.
Bamboo is also resistant to knife scarring, due to its hard density and is known for its durability and affordability.

Do all cutting boards harbor bacteria?
Yes! The scars left on cutting boards can be a breeding ground for germs, and tht is especially dangerous with plastic-based cutting boards. No one wants bits of plastic in or on their food. Because of the way you use the two cutting surfaces to sandwiched together to sanitize your knives, it also sanitizes BOTH cutting surfaces.
 
Why are there two knife sharpeners?

We're Misen.We design and make premium kitchen tools at fair prices. To preorder our Dutch Oven and make it a reality, click Back It. Or read on!    All backers receive 7qt Dutch Oven base and their choice of grill OR traditional lid.    Why Remake a Classic?  The Misen Dutch Oven offers premium durability, updated features, and superior cooking — at a reasonable price. The dutch oven is a workhorse. It can sauté, sear, boil, fry, bake, and braise, from the stove, to the oven, to the table.Unfortunately, premium dutch ovens that last a lifetime are insanely expensive and overpriced. And cheaper, low-quality ones are prone to chipping and scratches — making them useless in just a few years.We think there should be a better option. Premium quality and durability that will last forever, but sold for a fair and honest price.     It's Built to Last a Lifetime  High-End Protection Against Chipping & CrackingWe used 4 layers of enamel (the strongest enamel available) to prevent chipping, scratching, and cracking. It’s the luxury brands’ secret to life-long reliability.Cheaper brands have hand-dipped enamel, creating uneven coatings that crack and chip more easily. Our modern spray application ensures an even coat that’s consistent down to 0.02 mm. Zero imperfections make for a lifetime of toughness.  Superior Durability: The Ball Drop Test  We dropped a 2 lb. metal ball from a 3 ft. height into each dutch oven to simulate metallic impact. We wanted to make sure that our dutch oven was the most durable on the market, so we put it to the test.We dropped a 2-pound steel ball from 3 feet in the air to simulate the dutch oven owner’s worst nightmare: a hard metallic impact. Cheap dutch ovens chipped and flaked almost immediately. But drop after drop, Misen's enamel coating remained chip-free and outlasted the competitors. Including the most expensive ones.   Our enamel outperformed the cheap brands, and matched or exceeded the expensive brands.  All-In-One Versatility  Grill Lid Makes This Dutch Oven Even More VersatileDutch ovens can already do almost anything in the kitchen. We wanted to make ours even more versatile.So we designed a grill top lid that provides the same tight seal as our traditional lid, but can also be used alone as an indoor grill. The same premium cast iron and enamel layers help create a nearly-nonstick grilling experience and perfect browning.If you prefer the traditional knob-style lid, don't worry — we offer those too.   Bonus Silicone Lid  Extra Versatility and ProtectionThis added silicone lid creates an airtight seal on your Misen Dutch Oven — handy if you’re using the grill top lid and base at the same time. It’s highly durable, PFOA-free, oven-safe, and made from platinum-grade silicone.Plus, it stacks neatly between the lid and base when you’re storing them away.    Compatibility   It's Honestly Priced   Premium durability, at a fraction of the price.We don't think you should have to choose between wildly expensive “premium” pieces and the lower-quality cheap dutch ovens.Luxury brands are durable, but carry unnecessarily high price tags thanks to clever branding. By working closely with our factories and selling directly to you, we're able to offer the same quality (or better!) at a much more reasonable price.Our goal was simple. Create the most durable dutch oven possible, and sell it for a price that’s fair and affordable.  It's Easy to Care For  Nearly Nonstick, Zero Maintenance Needed, Dishwasher Safe Our enamel is smooth enough to be nearly nonstick without any maintenance.Most messes just need a gentle soak and scrub to wipe away. Our dutch oven is also dishwasher-safe (though we’d prefer you hand-wash)!  Key FeaturesThoughtful design updates to a classic piece make this dutch oven even easier to use at home  Design Process  The Millimeters Matter We spent over 18 months researching and developing the Misen Dutch Oven.

It’s fully automated, so you don’t have to worry about babysitting your steaks. Finally, you can have high-end, steakhouse quality, premium dry-aged meat at home, without the hassle or risk. No ridiculous markups or complicated systems — just delicious, tender steaks. Age up to 100 lbs of meat safely, effectively, and professionally with only 3 sq feet of space.Primo Ager is fully automated and ensures your meat is always of the highest quality and safety standards. Temperature, humidity and air flow are strictly regulated and controlled by the integrated smart system and can be easily tracked and modified from the mobile app. Receive live updates directly to your phone and know exactly when your meat is ready to eat. No setup needed. Primo Ager is ready to go out of the box! It doesn’t need a water supply or even much space to operate. Simply plug it in and start aging. Professional dry-aging has never been this easy.Every professional chef agrees — dry-aged meat just tastes better. From the concentrated flavor to the unmatched tenderness, a dry-aged steak is what separates the ordinary from the extraordinary. Each bite will have significantly more flavor and better texture.Dry-aging works by naturally breaking down the meat in a hyper-controlled environment. Humidity and temperature are closely monitored and regulated to prevent the growth of health-hazardous bacteria and mold and allow beneficial internal enzymes and fermentation to break down the meat.Moisture is drawn out, concentrating the meaty flavor. Natural enzymes found in the meat disassemble the collagen and connective tissues that make the meat tough, tenderizing it without sacrificing its integrity. The fat also begins to oxidize, adding another layer of intoxicating umami, while the fermentation contributes exotic nutty, buttery, and aromatic flavors. The result is a beautifully dry and tender steak that boasts a highly concentrated flavor enhanced by the sweetness and umami of broken down fats.From Gordon Ramsay to 21 Michelin-starred chef, Alain Ducasse, top chefs around the world swear by a well-aged steak. There’s no denying it — dry-aging is the best way to prepare your meat.With all the hype around dry-aging, you’d expect people to try it at home. And they have. There is a problem though. The typical refrigerator isn’t built for dry-aging. There’s no ventilation, no humidity regulation, and the temperature fluctuates every time you open the door or change what’s inside. Plus, all the other food and fridge smells start to bleed into your meat. No one wants a steak that tastes like old fridge.All these factors combine to promote spoilage, rot, and the growth of life-threatening bacteria and mold that render your meat completely inedible. Some people have recommended wrapping your meat in cheesecloth or paper towels to absorb the moisture. However, this simply does not work. In fact, J. Kenji López-Alt, author of The Food Lab, conducted a very thorough experiment using this method to “dry-age” at home. The results? This is impossible with most typical home setups. The only way you could easily get a safe-to-eat dry-aged steak was at a high-end butcher shop or premium steakhouse. Till now.Primo Ager is a professional dry-aging system made for your home. It’s designed and engineered with professional-grade technology, materials, and processes to ensure you always get safe, high-quality, premium dry-aged meat with every use. Best of all, it’s fully automated — making the dry-aging process simple and easy.With Primo Ager, you can turn your locally bought ribeye into a tender, flavor-packed delicacy, transform your tenderloin into a rich, robust beefy beauty, and bring your T-Bone to its fullest potential.Enjoy the full density of meaty flavor, mouth-watering umami, and unique aromas that range from buttery corn to smooth cheese. Let your teeth sink into your steak like butter and experience the rare, pure sensation of zero resistance tenderness. Feel the blend of broken down fats and soft protein melt in your mouth. This is pure perfection in meat form. Why settle for supermarket meat? Now with Primo Ager, you can easily get steakhouse quality in your own home. No markups, no reservations, no crowds — just your kitchen, a bottle of wine, and some candles for the perfect date night. Serve up a quality steak that tastes just like Chef Ramsay would prepare himself, and save yourself hundreds to potentially thousands of dollars along the way.A steakhouse dinner for two, some sides and a nice bottle of wine can add up pretty fast at any quality restaurant. With the Primo Ager System, you will be able to save money by bringing quality meat into your home and letting Primo Ager prepare it perfectly at the touch of a button.Primo Ager is specifically designed and engineered to have every feature work together for the ultimate dry-aging experience at home. Every single aspect and detail is refined to ensure the highest quality meat and safest process. This is the Primo System. 24/7 Real-Time Monitoring & Self-Regulating SystemPrimo Ager’s smart self-regulating system measures and monitors the temperature, humidity, and airflow in real-time as well as how much meat is stored at any given moment. It will then automatically adjust as needed to optimize your aging process for the highest-quality meat, safest environment.Maximized Storage CapacityPrimo Ager boasts the largest dry-aging fridge capacity for its size. With only 3 feet of floor space, Primo Ager can store up to 100 lbs (45kg) of meat at a time, without compromising surface exposure. Combined with our exclusive optional patented partition racks, you get maximum dry-aging storage with minimal space.High Precision Temperature RegulatorA powerful, high precision temperature regulator prevents temperature fluctuations and ensures your meat stays at a safe and optimal temperature throughout its entire aging process.Smart Integrated Humidity ControlPrimo Ager’s smart integrated humidity control is fully automated and ensures proper drying occurs without the growth of unwanted bacteria or mold. Unlike other systems, no external water supply is needed — making setup a breeze.Commercial-Grade Air Jet Booster & CompressorPrimo Ager uses a high-powered air flow system meant for full, professional, large-scale operations. A commercial-grade real force, evaporator-type fan keeps air circulating at a healthy rate throughout the entire dry-aging process.The large-capacity compressor, jet booster, and condenser work together to ensure all the meat in Primo Ager always gets the proper air flow and oxygen exposure.UV-C Sterilization Air FilterPrimo Ager integrates a UV-C light to kill any bacteria and mold that might be floating around inside. The light sterilizes everything and purifies the air that circulates through the system, so your meat stays safe and unspoiled.Unlike low-quality DIY systems, our UV-C light is not actually visible to the user. We did this to maintain professional dry-aging standards and conduct. UV-C light can be harmful to humans if exposed directly and can also disrupt the dry-aging process. The UV-C light in Primo Ager is located in the internals where the air gets compressed, funnelled, and recirculated. From here, the light can completely sterilize the full air supply in Primo Ager without affecting the aging process or potentially harming you.Industry Standard Insulated DoorPrimo Ager’s industrial standard insulated door seals your meat for maximum control over temperature, humidity and air quality. The door keeps the circulating air contained and regulated. It also prevents external contaminants from entering. This ensures efficient energy usage and effective quality regulation.Automated Cloud-Enabled Logging & NotificationsPrimo Ager is also smart. Cloud technology inside Primo Ager logs all your meat and tracks their dry-aging process. When your meat is ready to cook, Primo Ager will alert you via the mobile app. You can also see on the app how long each individual piece in Primo Ager has been aging. Set timers and logs hands-free with Amazon Alexa and Google Home smart integration. Ask Alexa to tell you when your ribeye is ready. Primo Ager is fully integrated with the latest in cloud technologies. Check your meat anytime, anywhere. Always know when your steak is prime and ready to go. LED Notification Touch PanelAn external EZ-touch LED notification control panel allows you to check the air quality, temperature and humidity inside Primo Ager without opening it. Through the intuitive touch interface, you can fine tune details and specifications as needed to ensure your meat is aged how you want it.
Optional Proprietary Partition RacksOur advanced proprietary meat racks prevent cross-contamination while giving you flexibility in storing full or half-sized racks of steak. The unique design maximizes your meat’s surface area exposure to air while minimizing the space needed for storage. This allows you to age more meat simultaneously, while ensuring each piece gets the air exposure it needs to dry-age properly.Primo Ager’s high quality regulatory system isn’t just great for dry-aging meat. It creates perfect environments to store and age all your favorite cheeses and wines. Presets for each category are pre-programmed in Primo Ager, so you can switch settings instantly from the front door panel or the app whenever you want.

In our work life, we are business people. But once we get home, we are a group of enthusiastic home cooks. Like many home cooks, we are always trying to improve the way we cook, from experimenting with new recipes, to learning about technology that would help us make great meals for our families.A few years ago, we encountered something truly wonderful in a restaurant: dry-aged beef. However, we were shocked by the price; dry-aged steaks are truly a luxury product. We decided that we would put our heads together and look for a way to make dry-aged beef ourselves.One of the things we have access to is commercial kitchen products. We asked ourselves, “could we get a commercial-grade dry ager for our homes?” Unfortunately, we found that these machines are huge and would not be practical for our apartments. Even machines that were developed for home use would take up too much space. The other obstacle was price — we were not prepared to spend so much money on a machine that would take up so much space.Our solution was to put our professional knowledge to work: we built a space-saving, reasonably priced dry ager for the home cook. We created a dry aging refrigerator that gives the user an optimal amount of room for meat, while being small enough to fit in the room. Primo Ager is versatile enough to accommodate other functions. It is controlled through our phones and is hygienic. Most importantly, it is reasonably priced, so that any home cook will feel confident that they are buying a high-quality product at a great price point. We want Primo Ager to be affordable for anyone to enjoy restaurant quality dry-aged beef in the comfort of their home. Primo Ager was created in partnership with a professional kitchen equipment manufacturer with more than 30 years of experience and knowledge of equipment production for a vast variety of businesses across the US, Europe and Asia, covering global brands, chain hotels and restaurants. Using our design and engineering expertise and their manufacturing experience, we created an amazing unit that is not just beautiful to look at, but practical and effective for dry aging. Our philosophy is to create contemporary style appliances that are easy to incorporate into daily life. Whether you are a hardcore meat lover or just like enjoy a good steak, Primo Ager is perfect for you and your home. In the next 3 years, we want to be able to extend our product line from our dry aging fridge to other smart AI kitchen home appliances.1. Dashdorj D, Tripathi VK, Cho S, Kim Y, Hwang I.

<p>Shaving has been using essentially the same technology for 5000 years. To make any real progress, we needed to take a radical new approach. </p>
<p>2 Billion razors or razor heads are thrown away each year in the US alone! Due to the hazardous nature of the blades, they can't be sorted &amp; no individual municipality or district produces enough to make specialized collection cost effective. So they end up in land fills &amp; garbage dumps. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Many areas of the world are experiencing a drought &amp; paying high prices for water. As these droughts become more common &amp; severe, water usage becomes more restricted.</p>
<p>Even though the Skarp Razor can be used with water, for example in the shower, it doesn't require any water. Which will help you feel better about keeping that lawn green or having that next water balloon fight!</p>

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>Due to the size of the micro components involved, there will be un-known levels of fine tuning required for automated production in high volume. However we have taken this into consideration for our projected delivery of March 2016.</p>
<p>Similarly when ramping up delivery of key components, quality control could become a challenge &amp; is of high priority to us.</p>
<p>The special optical fiber we are ordering with your support is the first of its kind. Everything first time can have un-known risks.</p>
<p>Many have asked us to show a closer shave with the prototype shaver, and we would love to, but can’t. Here is why.</p>
<p>The prototype in the demo video can’t cut much closer because the hand-made fiber in the prototype breaks when lightly bouncing it off the skin. It’s made of glass and is very thin. It also can’t be mounted with the necessary support to prevent that. The hand drawn fiber that you see cutting hair in the videos has an un-even surface that doesn’t uniformly couple the laser light into the hair over the whole cutting region. </p>
<p>Your support will allow us order the new factory made fiber. Please see the time line in the campaign.</p>
<p>The new fiber design can be mounted rigidly &amp; supported to prevent breaking. It also couples the hair-cutting laser 'blade' evenly into the hairs.</p>
<p>The new fiber design has an extremely hard surface. We expect it to take several years to wear it out with normal use, but that can’t be tested until we have made it. </p>

Many have asked us to show a closer shave with the prototype shaver, and we would love to, but can’t. Here is why.
The prototype in the demo video can’t cut much closer because the hand-made fiber in the prototype breaks when lightly bouncing it off the skin. It’s made of glass and is very thin. It also can’t be mounted with the necessary support to prevent that. The hand drawn fiber that you see cutting hair in the videos has an un-even surface that doesn’t uniformly couple the laser light into the hair over the whole cutting region. 
Your support will allow us order the new factory made fiber. Please see the time line in the campaign.
The new fiber design can be mounted rigidly & supported to prevent breaking. It also couples the hair-cutting laser 'blade' evenly into the hairs.
The new fiber design has an extremely hard surface. We expect it to take several years to wear it out with normal use, but that can’t be tested until we have made it. 
Morgan Gustavsson & his team have decades of experience with bringing new technologies, cosmetic & medical products to market successfully.
Bio

Morgan Gustavsson, MBBS, is Co-Founder & CEO of Skarp Technologies.
He has been a pioneer in the medical & aesthetic laser device industry since working as a medical doctor in the 1980’s. This includes expanding clinical frontiers with medical and surgical lasers in the 1980's and 1990's & in 1989 inventing, patenting and in 1990 exhibiting the first IPL (Intense Pulsed Light) in the world, later becoming a multi billion dollar industry.
In the last decade he has invented the TRASER technology (light amplification by spontaneous emission of radiation) for laser surgery, on which he holds ten recent US patents and has published several articles in peer reviewed scientific journals.
Articles can be found at: http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0035899
His previous positions over almsot three decades include:
CEO Rockport Consulting Services, Inc. Innovation in new light sources. Clinical investigation. Strategic partnerships.
Chief Scientist Venus Concept Ltd
Director of Advanced Innovation Syneron, Inc
Head of special R&D Lasers and electro-optical medical device Full time inhouse Consultant Candela Corporation
CEO American Medical Bio Care, Inc. / Medical Bio Care, Int Manufacturer in EU and the US of Medical device and Cosmeceuticals
CEO Kings Clinic (laser surgery) 
President Gothenburg Laser Clinic (laser bio-stimulation and medicine)
Paul Binun Co-Founder & CTO of Skarp Technologies 
With an MS degree in Applied Physics. He brings with him over twenty four years of experience in lasers and optics starting in the field while still in college to make some extra money to pay for college expenses. This has turned into a career which involved laser engineering ranging from the highly powerful lasers to the low power precision lasers for instrumentation. 
In addition to lasers Mr. Binun has experience in designing various optical systems which employ lasers and other optical sources, fiber optics and other optical waveguides, and free space propagation of light.
Much of the work involves the physics of light interaction with organic tissue. His passion is to push the edge of that envelope where science meets the practical application.

FAQ
Is it safe?
Yes, the laser is low power & eye safe. Unlike Laser hair removal, the light from the Skarp Razor never enters the skin so there is no risk of damage.
How long will the laser last?
the laser has a life of 50,000 hours.
How long will the battery last?
The Skarp Razor uses a small battery that will last about a month with normal use.
Can we see a demo?


There is a demo above, you can also view it here. Also take the time to read the text first. It explains in detail why the production model will be vastly superior & capable of a full a proper shave.

Will it cause complications like laser hair removal can?
The wavelength we're using doesn't emit UV. The power of the laser is too low to cause damage. But more importantly, the laser doesn't enter the skin, it only enters the hair. So there is absolutely no risk of developing any complications or damage.
Does it produce a smell?
No. Because we're not actually burning the hair, it doesn't produce a burnt hair smell.
Is it waterproof?
Yes. It can be used in the shower if required.
Is it patented?
Oh yes!
Will it take longer to shave with the Skarp Razor?
No. Shaving with the Skarp Razor will be very easy & shave a little quicker than you current method.
Why do you all have beards?
We look more manly that way.....right?
Can I shave at normal speed?
Yes you can. You don't have to shave at slow speeds! You'll even finish a little quicker as you won't have to lather up!",6.0,2,"1 Campaign

<p>Keeping plants alive and flourishing is difficult when growing indoors due to lack of sunlight. To overcome this, an LED grow light is essential for adequate light. The LeGrow 2021 LED grow light will turn on when you switch it on and turn off 12 hours later automatically. This sets the autonomous lighting system, which will then automatically repeat the process daily to ensure proper lighting for your garden. LeGrow 2021 takes care of it for you!<br/> </p>

<p>Some plants need higher humidity to thrive. The humidifier can help you build an environment that is conducive to proper humidity so you can grow your plants better.</p>
<p>If you have ever visited a tropical garden or climates where plants thrive, you probably noticed the high level of humidity in the atmosphere. While watering plants is important, it is also essential to maintain consistent humidity. LeGrow 2021 adds a 360° diffusing mist humidifier as a solution.<br/> </p>

<h1>LeGrow Story<br/> </h1>
<p>Hi there! My name is Haobin Lin and I am originally from Mainland China. When I was a young boy I was fortunate enough to grow up in the magnificent Chinese countryside. Beautiful plants and animals surrounded me. This experience left me with a deep connection to nature. I always felt calm amidst its tranquility.</p>
<p>Unfortunately though, as I grew older and took on new responsibilities I was forced to leave my village. First I went to university, and then to the big city to earn an income for my family. Over time the longing for the natural world grew inside me, but it wasn’t until about 5 years ago that I finally had to act.</p>
<p>When my daughter was born I decided that if it was impossible for us to leave the city, I must bring the beauty of nature to my daughter. So began a 3-year journey to create the best indoor garden I could design.</p>
<p>One day I noticed my daughter playing with her favorite toys – “building blocks.” In that moment I realized that indoor gardens could be so much more than just a bunch of pots. By allowing you to stack and expand your pots everyone can create a unique garden just like my daughter's unique building creations.</p>
<p>The Lego-like design has the added benefit of fitting into smaller spaces like our apartment. However, it also provides flexibility, so that my daughter can move and expand her garden as she grows. Once I began to design the pot I realized that this garden could do even more.</p>
<p>I noticed that indoor gardens could be quite messy! This is because of the multiple ventilation holes on the bottom of traditional pots that allow excess water and soil to get everywhere. So as I designed our planter pots I added an internal water reservoir that can capture the excess water and an elevated ventilation hole to reduce soil escape.</p>
<p>With the mess taken care of, I quickly realized that we needed to improve the lighting in our apartment if we wanted anything to grow to its fullest. My wife and daughter were particularly keen on succulents and would often leave them on the windowsill to get light, yet that still was not enough. So I set about to design a lighting fixture that could provide for multiple plants at once and have an automatic shut-off so they don’t get too much light.</p>
<p>At this point, things were going well and our plants were getting better, but some still continued to struggle. After some research, I realized that many plants require moisture in the air to thrive.</p>
<p>Instead of buying an off-the-shelf humidifier, I decided to create something beautiful, compact and that would match our building block concept. This provided an especially difficult challenge for me and it took 23 designs before I finally created a 360° diffusing mist humidifier.</p>
<p>Not only do our plants get the moisture they need, but it also provides additional health benefits. My eyes are less dry and I sneeze far less often when I work next to the humidifier. At this point, our garden system was shaping up to be a beautiful, easy-to-use masterpiece, but there was still one more thing I wanted to do.</p>
<p>Since I spend countless hours at the office I wanted to add some greenery to my desk. Our system works perfectly for workspaces, but one day I thought ‘wouldn’t it be cool if I could charge my phone with the plant on my desk?’ I immediately started working on our Power Pot.</p>
<p>This mini power hub has 4 USB ports so that it can power the LED lamp and humidifier, plus my phone and tablet.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until we completed the Power Pot prototype that I realized how incredibly convenient it truly was. Any desk, end table, or countertop can now have a beautiful plant and a quick-charge station!</p>
<p>This whole project over the past 3 years has been an amazing experience. Not only was the LeGrow Garden born, but also, I was able to spend quality time with my daughter planting, growing, and expanding our home garden. Now we hope to share this experience with you.</p>
<p>The money we raise here on Kickstarter will provide us with the capital necessary to start full production of the LeGrow Garden. We hope someday it can help millions of people reconnect with nature and grow something beautiful. Thank you!<br/> </p>

Unboxing video of LeGrow Home Garden
 
If you need something to light up your life, there is nothing better than a desktop planter to beautify your room and refresh you. LeGrow 2021 is a planter system with a modern twist that makes growing plants easier than ever. The modular system is connected so that watering any plant, automatically shares the moisture equally with all the other plants. It’s fast, easy, and takes the hassle out of maintaining your garden. 4 years ago, we launched our first campaign on Kickstarter. It was a great success and now, after 4 years of development and feedback from the LeGrow community, we are back with the upgraded LeGrow 2021. Our new system is better than ever and ready to help your plants thrive while you experience the joy of indoor gardening.  
 
 

 
  Modular Designed Blocks 
 
LeGrow 2021 is a modular designed planter system. With every single LeGrow planter, a fun & functioning indoor garden can be built. Simply place different modules together for different uses. There are LED grow lamps, self-watering trays, specially made humidifiers, and other blocks in the LeGrow 2021 garden pack. Build your indoor garden as easy as playing with Lego, fun and creative. Super Easy To Build 
 
LeGrow 2021 makes building an indoor garden easy. As you place each piece, they connect together and your indoor garden comes to life. The system includes watering components, humidifiers and lights. You won’t need to worry about frequent watering and adequate sunlight for your plants. LeGrow 2021 includes everything you need for a thriving indoor garden wherever you choose to put it.
 
 

Low Maintenance 
 LeGrow Side Table Garden
Taking care of multiple plants can be a real hassle for busy people. Plants require careful watering for proper growth and it’s a task that is easily overlooked. LeGrow 2021 has an automatic watering system so that you don’t need to water the plants every day. Even if you leave for a trip, LeGrow 2021 will keep your plants happy and healthy while you’re away. How to water
 
Watering LeGrow 2021 garden is super easy. Simply pour water into the self-watering tray, it will distribute it to all the plants evenly. Therefore, you don’t need to water the plants one by one and you won’t water too much at once. You can save both time and water with a LeGrow 2021 indoor garden.
 
   Patent Pending
LeGrow 2021 developed a self-watering tray for its indoor garden system. The patented water pipe structure ensures that all the planters are connected and the plants can receive the water equally, while the roots are ventilated to encourage healthy grow. The water level is visible so that you’ll know when to water again. 
 
Keeping plants alive and flourishing is difficult when growing indoors due to lack of sunlight. To overcome this, an LED grow light is essential for adequate light. The LeGrow 2021 LED grow light will turn on when you switch it on and turn off 12 hours later automatically. This sets the autonomous lighting system, which will then automatically repeat the process daily to ensure proper lighting for your garden. LeGrow 2021 takes care of it for you! 
 
Some plants need higher humidity to thrive. The humidifier can help you build an environment that is conducive to proper humidity so you can grow your plants better.
If you have ever visited a tropical garden or climates where plants thrive, you probably noticed the high level of humidity in the atmosphere. While watering plants is important, it is also essential to maintain consistent humidity. LeGrow 2021 adds a 360° diffusing mist humidifier as a solution. 
 
 
You can connect your phone with the LeGrow 2021 Bluetooth speaker and enjoy music at home, playing some peaceful natural sounds and watch your lovely garden grow. LeGrow 2021 creates a calm and relaxing home garden.
 
 
 
 
 

Grow indoor herbs year-round 
 LeGrow Herb Garden -L
With LeGrow 2021 you can grow all the kitchen herbs you need and keep the harvest season going all winter long to flavor your favorite dishes and take your cooking to the next delicious level! 

Release your stress and anxiety 
 
Research has shown that indoor plants can reduce tension in people by almost 40 percent because they remind us of the outdoors, nature, and a slower pace of life. Indoor gardening releases your stress and calms your emotions. Why grow your own vegetable garden?
 
Having a vegetable garden for fresh organic food is more important than ever. Growing your own vegetable garden is an easy way to save money, stay active, and have fresh vegetables, herbs at your fingertips! No chemical pesticides, no food contamination. All you eat is clean and healthy. Better for mental health
 The design is inspired by Garden by the bay Singapore
For people who spend a lot of time indoors, healthy air quality should be a top priority. Some plants can remove pollutants such as formaldehyde, benzene, trichloroethylene, and carbon monoxide. With all these plants, your indoor air gets purified and you can breathe clean fresh air.

<p>We've worked really hard to make Flic as battery efficient as possible while still keeping it diverse for all sorts of applications. This is why we have prepared Flic to work in three different modes. In most use-cases Flic will mostly be turned off until it's pressed. In this mode the battery will last up to 60 000 clicks which is more than enough for anyone.</p>

We thought it might be good to share some of them so you know what we are dealing with.</p>
<p>Component supply: Flic, or any product for that matter, contains a significant amount of components. These components come from different suppliers which have different lead times for their components. If ONE of these suppliers has a short supply or a long leadtime this will delay the entire production, if a substitute is not found for that component.</p>
<p>Enhancements in production: When in production there are a couple of parameters that can be improved during the process such as the color, click feeling, translucence, IP class etc. Making such enhancements during the process will be in order to improve your experience with Flic. We will do everything we can to ensure that Flic ships with superior quality.</p>
<p>Shipping and customs: When we start shipping there's always a risk of the product getting stuck in customs, either when we are receiving the products from the factory or shipping them to you. We have prepared as well as we can and hopefully there won't be any delays.</p>

<p style=""font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;font-weight: bold;"">1. What is Flic?</p>
<p style=""font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;font-weight: 300;"">Flic is a wireless shortcut button that sticks to any surface and can trigger any function on your smartphone, such as your music or ordering a Taxi.</p>
<p style=""font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;font-weight: bold;"">2. How do I trigger my Flic?</p>
<p style=""font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;font-weight: 300;"">Flic connects to a smartphone (both IOS and Android) or similar. When flic is pressed, it uses the device to activate a function predefined by the user. This function can either be something directly on the device - such as make a loud sound so the user can find it - or something else such as turning on a light or starting music on the stereo.</p>
<p style=""font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;font-weight: bold;"">3. How many functions can I predefine my Flic with?</p>
<p style=""font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;font-weight: 300;"">You can predefine three different functions per Flic – <b>Click</b>, <b>Double</b> <b>Click</b> and <b>Hold</b>. These functions are easily changed in the Flic app.</p>
<p style=""font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;font-weight: bold;"">4. How does my Flic work?</p>
<p style=""font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;font-weight: 300;"">Flic uses Bluetooth Low-energy (BLE) to communicate with your smartphone.</p>
<p style=""font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;font-weight: bold;"">5. What is the range of my Flic?</p>

 How to start Flicing


Lets say I want Flic to skip to the next song when I Double Click:


 


Press the Flic in the center screen and it will show you the three ways to use Flic: Click, Double Click and Hold. Next, we choose Double Click, and select Music. 

The Music settings will be shown and we choose “Skip to next song”, that’s it! Now Flic will skip to the next song each time you Double Click. No need to have the phone around!




Designed for everyone
 




Technical Details Flic uses Bluetooth Low Energy to communicate with your device and is compatible with iPhone 4s & later, iPad 3rd generation & later and select Android devices with 4.3 and later with Bluetooth 4.0.
We've worked really hard to make Flic as battery efficient as possible while still keeping it diverse for all sorts of applications. This is why we have prepared Flic to work in three different modes. In most use-cases Flic will mostly be turned off until it's pressed. In this mode the battery will last up to 60 000 clicks which is more than enough for anyone.
There is more to Flic than you might think. To give you a better feeling here is an exploded view of the different parts.

Flic will come with a double-sided adhesive that allows you to stick it to any surface. You can easily peel it off and restick it again. 
 

The Journey Behind Flic.
 
We've gone through an immense journey to get to the design that we are offering today. Below you can see the different prototype steps we have gone through to finally bring you Flic.

In March we flew off to join the Hardware Incubator Highway 1 in San Francisco. While we were there, we decided to do a respin on the product design before bringing it to the market. 
Together with the amazing guys at P E O P L E   P E O P L E, We went through another design cycle as you can see below.

After finding the right design, we flew off to China to have a look at some factories while finding suppliers to start prototyping.

We assembled the prototypes and started the DFM work to prepare the product for manufacturing.

A lot of changes were made to the initial prototype design such as the LED which had too low intensity as you can see below.
And now, we are ready to bring the Flic to you...The Journey is yet to be over.

Why we need your help We can all agree that smartphones are a huge part of the 21st century. Everything is getting integrated around the smartphone and most recently even our homes and cars. With Flic we want to make all this fantastic technology which our smartphones enable accessible to everyone. The next step after Flic is even more exciting but first we need your help to bring Flic to the market.
  


Timeline 

  
 Where the Funds Will go The hardware is close to done with most of the DFM work already made. With a successful campaign we will start ordering the tools needed.
We have come this far and now we need your support to take the next step. We will be working closely with the manufacturers to make sure that everything runs as smoothly as possible and you getting your Flics in time.

Risks There's always risks that can delay the process before Flic gets into your hands. We thought it might be good to share some of them so you know what we are dealing with.
Component supply: Flic, or any product for that matter, contains a significant amount of components. These components come from different suppliers which have different lead times for their components. If ONE of these suppliers has a short supply or a long leadtime this will delay the entire production, if a substitute is not found for that component.
Enhancements in production: When in production there are a couple of parameters that can be improved during the process such as the color, click feeling, translucence, IP class etc. Making such enhancements during the process will be in order to improve your experience with Flic. We will do everything we can to ensure that Flic ships with superior quality.
Shipping and customs: When we start shipping there's always a risk of the product getting stuck in customs, either when we are receiving the products from the factory or shipping them to you. We have prepared as well as we can and hopefully there won't be any delays.

3. How many functions can I predefine my Flic with?
You can predefine three different functions per Flic – Click, Double Click and Hold. These functions are easily changed in the Flic app.

So instead of dreading shutting off the hot water, you’ll look forward to drying off in a luxurious cloud of warm air.   You’re wiping sh*t all over your clean body when you dry off with a towel. No, really.  On top of that, experts recommend that you replace towels (at least) every two years.   Learning how gross your towels are is unsettling, but there’s a solution.  BODYPLUV gives you a cleaner, more hygienic bathing routine by delivering a fresh, contactless drying experience that’s quick and feels amazing.  No need to call your electrician or remodel your shower. Anyone can install BODYPLUV in a minute! You simply apply it to your bathroom wall with included nano gel tape, plug it in and you’re ready to air dry after every shower. Installation Steps:
 Apply the nano gel tape to your bathroom wall by an outlet.
 Mount your BodyPluv to four round pins on each corner of the wall mount.
 Plug it in and dry off like never before!
     BODYPLUV powers on the moment you pull the handgrip downward off the wall mount and stops once you put it back or when the timer runs out.  Every other setting is controlled by a simple finger tap.    With BODYPLUV, you can dry every part of your body in 4 minutes with the extendable air hose. It stretches up to 78 inches and allows you to target those hard-to-dry places, like your underarms and privates.   Other body dryers are expensive and take long. They require you to stand on a fan platform and can’t target all your nooks and crannies (or the upper half of your body). No thanks!    BODYPLUV lets you manually target any area or enjoy a hands-free drying experience. You simply hang the air hose on the Hands-Free Holder and you can brush your teeth, shave and do your hair while drying off.    BODYPLUV has 4 temperature settings and 2 air speeds so you can find your perfect temperature during both humid summers and frigid winters.   Level one starts at 95℉ (closest to human body temperature) and Level 4 goes all the way up to 149℉. All you do is tap a button to switch between the 4 options.   In addition to temperature control, you can also change wind speed between Natural Wind Mode and Turbo Mode.    BODYPLUV helps you stay on schedule with a built-in Timer for 3, 6, 9 and 12 minutes. After 12 minutes, it automatically shuts off.  You can choose any of the time options but it defaults to 12 minutes, signaled by 4 lights over the Timer icon. Every 3 minutes one light goes out to show how much time is left before shut off.  It's easy to spend way too much time in a hot, steamy shower. Luckily for you, BODYPLUV has your back and won't allow you to waste time basking in a blanket of warm air. Showers could really use this feature...   Never wake partners, kids or roommates with BODYPLUV’s sleep-friendly sound levels.   Twenty-two percent of household water usage comes from doing laundry and about 5% of energy usage goes towards this as well.    BODYPLUV’s IPX4 rating means it stands up to the wettest environments, like your steamy, moisture-filled bathroom.  On top of that, it has a built-in safety system that automatically shuts it off after 12 minutes to prevent overheating and wasting energy.  Man’s best friend deserves hygienic drying too, which is why we include a soft, silicone brush  designed specifically for pets.  It won’t hurt your pet’s skin and it gives them the spa-like experience they deserve with every bath.   BODYPLUV’s made from the highest-quality materials so that it looks good, performs perfectly and lasts under moist conditions.    Using a hair dryer on your parts is a serious no. It takes minimal Googling to discover that while hair dryers have hot air that could dry your body, it’s not safe or healthy. You could end up with a burnt tip (you know the one) or crispy privates.  With that being said, people looove drying off below the belt with air because it feels incredible and thoroughly dries those hard to reach flaps and crevices. BODYPLUV gives you the same constant heat that feels amazing and dries every last drop of water, only it will never burn your skin. It’s safe on all of your body parts and makes your shower finale savor-worthy.  BODYPLUV makes drying off satisfying for everyone, regardless of age or ability. It’s warm and pleasant for kids after a bath, and you can use it to dry off your pet!   We all know how hard it is to get out of a really relaxing, hot shower or bath. Add winter to the mix and getting out of the shower becomes downright miserable.   BODYPLUV warms your body while drying it, so you step from one soothing temperature to another.  BODYPLUV’s ultra quiet air won’t scare kids or animals, and it feels so good, they’ll want drying off to take as long as possible.   BODYPLUV offers a more gentle drying alternative for sensitive skin with low temperatures and contactless drying.     One of the quickest ways to make a difference is to change just one thing that you do every day, like how you dry off after a shower.   Every time you dry off with BODYPLUV, there’s one less wet towel to wash and there’s less bacteria growing in your bathroom (and on your body). And the best part? It keeps you warm and feels incredible.  At BODYPLUV, our mission is to give you the most satisfying and hygienic way to dry your skin while helping the planet. Reducing water consumption and our dependence on towels is just the first step.   New to Indiegogo? No problem. Follow these simple steps to get your own BODYPLUV.  At the end of the campaign, we’ll send you a survey to get your BODYPLUV color choice and shipping information, and deliver your BODYPLUV when manufacturing is complete!              We have worked extremely hard to make this product ready for full-scale manufacturing and fulfillment, but here are what we see as the risks and our plan to assess them:MANUFACTURING: The manufacturer is lined up, and we have quality assurance people on site during production.FULFILLMENT: Sometimes things get a bit crazy and stuff happens that can’t be planned for: a supplier misses a deadline or a shipment gets lost.

The patented sensor and wi-fi enabled app allow you to monitor the humidity and water level, all at your fingertips. With multi-directional air intake and up to three different fan speeds, it is powerful enough to dehumidify your room, and quiet enough that you'll forget it's even there.Not all dehumidifiers are the same! It's no secret that using conventional units can have its downsides. With a smaller water tank, it can fill up within a few hours, meaning you have to pour out the water more often, or they stop working once the tank is full. They can be noisy, too large to store, and use a lot of electricity.The Midea Cube Dehumidifier fixes all these issues: with up to 3 times more water tank capacity (nearly 4.2 gallons/16L), multi-directional air intake for optimal dehumidification, and the ability to contract in half for flexible draining and compact storage. Furthermore, it enables streamlined and customizable humidity control through the mobile app: real-time water & humidity level monitoring, full-water alert and water level preset. This is much smarter than your old dehumidifier!   With Midea’s unique lift-and-twist extended design, the Cube dehumidifier has up to 3X more water tank capacity compared to a conventional unit. It sets a new standard for selecting the right dehumidifier: it's not just about the pint, but also the water tank that matches the needs of excess moisture and humidity removal. Up to 3 times longer than a conventional dehumidifier. That's how long the Midea Cube can run before you need to empty its 4.2 gallons water tank. We designed the Midea Cube with a water tank size up to 3X larger than most traditional dehumidifiers, so that it continues to operate until it reaches the desired humidity level at your home. That means fewer trips to the sink emptying out the water tank and more time for yourself. The Midea Cube's powerful multi-directional air intake system makes it ideal for whole-house dehumidification, effectively creating a safer and more comfortable environment anywhere – from your basement, bathroom, bedroom or living room when needed. With no tank, the Midea Cube is about half the size. This provides more flexibility when using the drain hose option. Simply place the unit above the sink or over a floor drain, using the included hose.Emptying buckets of water can be a hassle. That's why we gave the Midea Cube a drain hose option that saves you from constantly emptying the water tank. If you have a floor drain or sink available, you can empty the water directly without needing the bucket. This allows it to remove excess moisture around the clock without ever having to empty the water tank. With the smaller size, lower weight and easy to use the handle, you can place the cube anywhere. Midea Cube's nested design means you can easily find a place to store it when not in use and extend it to its full capacity whenever you need it again. Humidity control at your fingertips. The Midea Cube Air App allows you to monitor the real-time humidity level of your room and water level of your unit, adjust settings, and power the device on or off from your smartphone. You will receive a full-water alert and can check the status of your dehumidifier anywhere, so you can leave your home knowing it's in good hands. You can even personalize the settings depending on your needs and preferences. For example, if a full 4.2 gallons (16L) bucket is too heavy for you to lift up, you can preset the water level accordingly so it switches off when reaching your desired fill point, keeping it simple and easy for anyone to operate.  The Midea Cube uses a built-in sensor that allows you to monitor the water level in real-time, so you always know the exact status of your dehumidifier. Our algorithm can analyze the humidity level of your room and your unit settings and predict how long until the tank will be full. Equipped with a high-efficiency compressor, the Midea Cube offers a powerful yet efficient dehumidifier. The Midea Cube can effectively remove moisture in your home while conserving energy, helping create the perfect atmosphere for you and your loved ones to relax in. The Midea Cube is quiet. It gives off a mere 42-decibels (*test results under laboratory standard) while operating, meaning it’s quieter than your fridge!  Humidity in closets creates an environment where it leaves stored items smelling musty. The Midea Cube's Max mode is specially designed to dry clothes quickly. Just place it in your laundry room or closet, and let it do the work. The Midea Cube's sleek design fits in any room perfectly, not just the basement: its compact size makes it ideal for your home office; its silent operation will not disrupt your sleep when used in the bedroom. Moreover, the different humidity level settings make it suitable for any room from your bathroom to your home's hard-to-reach crawlspaces. Washable Dust Filter: Our filter can effectively reduce dust and other impurities in the air, plus it's easy to clean. Just rinse the dust filter in the sink every ten days. And no need to buy expensive replacement filters. Robust Handles: The handle is designed to comfortably lift the unit and carry a bucket of water, so you can whisk the excess water away without a worry. Tank Lock: The lock in the water tank helps ensure the unit orientation is always correct. It requires you to manually press the lock when storing the Midea Cube in the tank.    Are you still suffering from wet and rainy days? The quilts and sheets are too damp to fall asleep? Get allergic reactions more easily? Feel helpless with the mold in your house?  Actually, in a humid environment, bacterial growth increases quickly. It's very harmful to you and your family's health, especially for children and the elderly. All the problems mentioned above can be improved with the perfect antidote for a moist indoor environment. The solution is a dehumidifier! The primary function of a dehumidifier is to reduce the amount of humidity in the air, but it comes with plenty of additional benefits. Every home is different. Whether you’re in a studio apartment or have a two-story house, the Midea Cube will satisfy your current home needs. Take a look below to choose the best model for your home.

*give it time, it will play* Sorry about the beard??...?*All measurements are in MillimetersIt was important for us to consider all the functionalities of the everyday dental pick. In going from ""single use"" to a more durable and sustainable design, we wanted to make DuraPik eco-friendly and give it a more modern look. After intensive research and surveys, Durapik is the final result of all the work done by our team of eco-conscious engineers and designers, and our community!Your support will be funding:
 Injection moulding tools: The biggest investment required for DuraPik to go from a dream to a funky fresh reality is the making of the injection moulding tools. 
 First production runs: After setting up the manufacturing process, we’ll need to start the first production run. To do that, we will need to purchase various recycled raw materials as well as cover the costs of our manufacturing operations to produce the first-ever batch of DuraPiks. 
 Subscription service & online shop: To make your lifestyle easier and breezier, DuraPik will be offering a subscription-based service. To make that happen, we must set up an online shop and partner with the right logistics company to ensure our Durapik products get delivered on time and in good shape.
            We're happy to answer any queries you might have about the Durapik or if you need more details, please contacts us!                  Back us!",76.0,1,"1 Campaign

Heats Up 15% Faster
Uses 20% Less Pellets
Portable Design
Prepare your palate for a unique and flavorful experience. ASMOKE is the first portable (and versatile!) applewood grill that uses 100% all-natural applewood pellets.Other brands add harmful blends and unnatural fillers to their pellets. We don’t. We source our pellets from real fruit orchards. The apple trees are harvested, brought to our plant, and produced all in a few days to keep their freshness. By using only pure fruitwood, you’ll enjoy delectable, smoky-sweet flavors without the artificial taste. 


 
 
                                     

                                     
                                     

 


 

 


 

Flavors from the OrchardASMOKE fuels pure applewood pellets sourced from real orchards—infusing your meals with sweet and smoky undertones without the artificial taste. Our pellets do not contain any fillers, binding agents, chemicals, oils, or additives. Ever. More Ways to CookWhether you’re in the mood for prime rib roast or BBQ chicken pizza, ASMOKE’S versatility lets you grill, smoke, BBQ, bake, roast, braise, sear, and char-grill. Enjoy Longer CookoutsOther pellets burn quicker to maintain the same temperature. Our premium pellets, however, burn at about 8,500 BTU per pound. That means our pellets will reach 500°F 15% faster, stay hotter, and burn longer, so you don't have to go through bags of pellets constantly.ASMOKE also uses fewer pellets than other grills — saving up to 20%. That means less ash and fewer grill cleanups. Plus, you'll spend less money on pellets and spend more time perfecting your grilled recipes. Auto Pellet ReloadingWith the ASMOKE grill, you can still walk away when you need to, as it will maintain the desired temperature for you by automatically reloading pellets to regulate heat. No need to babysit! Perfect Precision Go low and slow, or fast and hot with a temperature dial ranging from 180° to 500°F. Color LED digital temperature display makes it easy to set the temperature you want so that you can cook with confidence. And with a programmable meat probe port, you'll get quick and accurate temperature readings to know when the meat is fall-off-the-bone ready. Great Pairs​Applewood pairs well with anything. Create a light, fruity-smoked flavor that enhances beef, lamb, chicken, pork, seafood, vegetables, and wild game. You’ll never need any other flavorings again.   Bring the Flavor Anywhere​Share your love of flavors anywhere that has a power outlet. From camping to tailgating, to your backyard, ASMOKE has you covered with its super portable design. It's also compact enough to be stored in any space—whether you have a backyard, patio, or deck. ASMOKE grills are great for camping and tailgating. However, it will require an inverter to convert the electricity from 12V to 120VC AC.

<p>The bulb has no internal batteries and it turns on via electromagnetic induction. The bulb uses warm light.

<p>Levia uses about 3 watts, which equates  to about 2 cents a day, and the LED light has a lifecycle of about 50000 working hours . So, if you used it for 8 hours a day for 365 days, the life span would be around 17 years.</p>

Levia is a unique design product! It’s a desk lamp that uses the magnetic levitation system, a method by which one object is suspended on another, thanks to a magnetic field which can combat the gravitational pull effect.
It allows the levitation of an LED filament lamp with a very high energy efficiency.
Levia’s advanced technology, combined with its amazing design, will blow you away!
 
 
 
The Levia desk lamp is the result of painstaking Italian craftsmanship. The base is made of Genuine Carrara or Black Marquina, which is cut by cnc and hand-finished for a polished and beautiful look..
 


 
 
Everything at an affordable price to everyone!
 
 
 
Simple Shapes, Amazing Design!
 
Levia ’has been painstakingly crafted to the finest detail.
The stem’s length allows the LED filament bulb to levitate at a height of about 20 cm from the ground above marble base: the effect is a perfect balance between the shapes and the levitation distance.
 

 
The centre of gravity is completely unbalanced, because of the metal stem’s extension outwards with the levitation system and the floating bulb at the end. However, it’s perfectly counterbalanced by the marble base.
 

 
The marble base has also an anti-slip and anti-scratch rubberized support, to avoid scratches and protect the support surfaces.
 

 
The touch sensitive button allows you to switch off the LED filaments with a single touch, by keeping the light bulb in levitation at the same time.

 
The fabric wire makes what has always been considered a disturbing element, an integral part of the design.
The meticulous attention to detail, the stem's colors and the different types of marble give Levia a high-level design, suitable to any kind of environment and furniture.


 

With the Highest Quality Materials.
 
The metal stem gives structure strength and support.

 
The base is made of genuine Carrara marble or black Marquina marble.


Carrara marble is a high quality type of white or blue-grey marble,  quarried in the city of Carrara located in Tuscany, Italy.
 

Black Marquinia marble  is a high quality, black stone marble extracted from the region of Markina, Basque Country in the North of Spain. 
 

 
Every single piece is cut by cnc and then hand-finished, according to the age-old tradition of Italian craftsmanship, a process that makes the product unique and inimitable.
 
 
 
 
 
With an integrated anti-fall system and very high energy efficiency.
 
Levia is managed by 3 electronic boards: one placed in the marble base, one in the levitation system and one in the light bulb. The levitation of the light bulb is very effective and extremely stable, thanks to a bi-directional and automatic management of the device. It makes its use simple, preventing any destabilization at the same time.
 
 
 
We asked passers-by to try to levitate the light bulb to prove the ease of its use. This is the result!
 
  
 
 Levia also has an anti-fall system that forces the light bulb to attach itself to the upper part in the event of a blackout, accidental shocks or interruption of the current flow.
 
 
​
The bulb has no internal batteries and it turns on via electromagnetic induction. The bulb uses warm light. Unlike cold light, this warm light is often associated with positive feelings and the human mind perceives it as soft and enveloping. Furthermore, it reduces eye strain and it greatly improves the sleep quality.
 

 

 
Levia uses about 3 watts, which equates  to about 2 cents a day, and the LED light has a lifecycle of about 50000 working hours . So, if you used it for 8 hours a day for 365 days, the life span would be around 17 years.

As mentioned above, the light bulb has no batteries and it turns on via electromagnetic induction!
 
 
 
If you just want to switch the led filaments off , you just have to touch the touch sensitive button on the marble base: that way, the bulb will continue to float.
 

 
The bulb is pulled up into the socket instead of falling and breaking if the current is shut off, thanks to the anti-fall system.
 

 
 
 

 

 

Levia is available in 5 different versions. 
 

 

 




Basic Version - Black or White metal stem and Carrara or Black Marquinia marble base.

Special Versione - Brass-lacquered metal stem and Carrara or Black Marquinia marble base.

Deluxe Version - Gold-plated copper stem and Portoro marble base.



 
The Levia Deluxe Portoro version has a real gold-plated copper stem and a Portoro marble base.
 

The gold-plated copper stem emphasizes the golden veins of the marble. The golden touch sensitive button fits perfectly to the base. The advanced technology, combined with the highest quality materials, makes Levia Deluxe Portoro something totally new and never seen before: it isa high-class design object, with a very high investment value.  
 

Portoro is a very precious variety of dark brilliant black marble with golden veins. Portoro marble can be found only in the province of La Spezia in Liguria, Italy.

It uses innovative nano-purification technology to detect and destroy allergens, bacteria, odors and toxic chemicals — turning them into water, carbon dioxide and harmless base compounds in the process.ALBERO’s 18dB ultra-silent cleaning mode is quieter than a whisper — allowing you breathe clean air without disturbance, so you can get a perfect night's sleep. Finally, wake up every morning feeling fully recharged, rested and refreshed.With the average American expected to spend over 90% of their lives indoors, we need effective air purifiers now more than ever before.Traditional HEPA and activated carbon filters collects contaminants rather than destroy them.  Bacteria and mold can easily accumulate, multiply, mutate and spread from the filter cartridges. Overtime, the filters can easily become a source of contamination themselves.ALBERO’s advanced PCO filtration offers a much better alternative to traditional HEPA filters. ALBERO vaporizes contagions even as they attempt to multiplyBacteria trapped in HEPA filters can grow and be released back into the air you breathe. ALBERO was tested and showed a 83% abatement of bacteria within the first three hours.Results: 83% reduction of bacteria within the first two hours of use has been reported during the experiment. The microbiological test has been conducted according to norm UNI EN ISO 14698 – 1: 2004 and UNI EN ISO 14698 – 2: 2004​.Results: 84% reduction of NOx has been registered during the test in just 2 minutes. This test was evaluated with a certified test according to norm UNI 11247:2010.Many harmful pollutants are under the 0.3-micron and are too small for HEPA filters to capture. ALBERO showed a 78% abatement of PM 0.3 (size under 0.3 micron) within the first two hours.Results: 78% reduction of PM 0.3 (size under 0.3 micron) within the first two hours of use. The PM abatement test has been conducted according to norm UNI EN ISO 14644-1.Photocatalytic oxidation (PCO) is a NASA-tested innovative nano-scale process that has been under research, testing and extensive development for the last 25 years. Now, the ALBERO team has finally reached a place of effectiveness and safety to proudly present it to the public. Destroy allergens, VOCs, formaldehyde, dust, dander, bacteria, mold and combustion gases, quickly and efficiently.Best of all, you never need to replace the nano-filter! Because ALBERO’s nano-filter vaporizes contaminants instead of collecting them, it doesn’t need replacements.Simply rinse it off every 6 months and you’re good to go for at least 5 years.The protective exterior nano-coating keeps ALBERO clean and protects it from corrosion, bacteria, dust, scratches and aging.Avoid the hidden costs of filter replacements that you would normally face in HEPA filters. You could be saving $100-$400 a year just by this feature alone! Plus, ALBERO comes with 3 years worth of nano-silver pre-filters, so you don’t have to worry about changing those out either!ALBERO’s patented air quality sensors, smart AI and mobile app lets you know what you’re breathing anytime, anywhere. ALBERO follows your habits while detecting and cleaning your air.If it detects anything harmful, ALBERO automatically sends you a notification and turns on to immediately start cleaning your air and reach the desired air quality. It then turns off or switches to silent mode depending on your air quality, energy consumption and overall preferences.ALBERO is always ready at your fingertips. With WiFi connectivity and an intuitive mobile app for iOS and Android, ALBERO gives you full control and smart capabilities from anywhere, even when you’re not at home.4 control modes let you control how fast and how often you want ALBERO to run.Connect it with Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa to control ALBERO with voice or hook it up to your smart home network. ALBERO is fully compatible and ready to automate with your existing setup.Don’t want to use the app? You can still easily control ALBERO manually through the touch button on the top of the device.Our proprietary titanium-coated ceramic nano-filters maximizes the effect of the photocatalytic reaction unlike any other filter tested. The patented alveolar design creates maximum surface area and ion exposure to ensure your air is fully purified quickly, efficiently and effectively.Unlike other PCO filters, ALBERO uses a highly calibrated, selected range of UV-A light near the visible spectrum that does not generate harmful ozone.Our non-woven pre-filter blocks large particles like pollen, dander and dust, and the antibacterial nano-silver treatment naturally kills bacteria and mold.ALBERO’s patented micro electrical mechanical system (MEMS) is the most advanced and precise sensor on the market. When ALBERO detects a decrease in air quality or presence of a dangerous compound, it automatically starts purifying your air and can continue to cycle your air to hit 100% purity.ALBERO’s ceramic nano-filters don’t need to be replaced. They can be rinsed and washed in tap water when needed. This means no hidden costs or wasteful expenses.ALBERO is the quietest filter on the market! Boasting an incredible 18dB noise output on silent mode, ALBERO is quieter than a whisperALBERO is 8x more efficient than traditional purifiers. It only uses 20W - 56W of energy for up to 540 sq ft of coverage!A LED light illuminates ALBERO and acts as a soft ambient lamp for your room. Easily control and change the intensity and temperature of the lighting via the included app.ALBERO holds an exclusive patent on its nanotechnology, air quality sensor and design — making it the only air purifier with all these benefits!ALBERO’s patented photocatalytic oxidation process uses a proprietary doped titanium dioxide (TiO2) ceramic filter as the base catalyst material. The filter’s specialized design maximizes the surface area of effect.A precisely calibrated, powerful UV light blasts the filter and also prevents the production of ozone. The light activates the catalyst and sends out charged ions to then attack and destroy any contaminants passing through the filter. This is the most optimal, effective and energy efficient method of air purification and eliminates more pollutants than any other available method.ALBERO is 8x more efficient than traditional air purifiers and uses significantly less energy. In fact, it only uses 20-56W of energy. That’s less than a single incandescent light bulb! Save hundreds of dollars per year on your energy bill alone.The low energy consumption doesn’t inhibit ALBERO’s efficacy. ALBERO has a maximum range of up to 540 sq ft and can filter up to 236 sq ft of space 90% cleaner in 2 hours!Plus, since you don’t need to change filters and get a 3 year supply of pre-filters, you don’t have to worry about hidden costs in filter replacements!Save money and energy while quickly and effectively purifying your home air.80% of ALBERO’s materials (bamboo wood, aluminium) are premium, eco-compatible and recyclable with less than 12% made from plastic.ALBERO was designed and engineered in Italy. We gave it a clean aesthetic and modern, minimalist design to reflect the purity of your air. Every detail was accounted for with painstaking Italian craftsmanship and thought.The compact, modern shape blends ALBERO with your home decor and enhances your space as ALBERO cleans it.ALBERO is not just a powerful home appliance, it’s a piece of art — worthy of your carefully curated space and designed to fit perfectly in your home.When you use ALBERO, you’re not just cleaning your own air — you’re stepping into a global community dedicated to improving our world’s air quality.ALBERO’s app lets you see how many pollutants you’ve removed from our planet and how your part adds up with all other ALBERO users to contribute to a much larger picture around the world. Stay connected and join the initiative to creating a healthier, cleaner world together.The air you breathe affects you in every facet of life. From work to home life, we spend too much of our lives inside.With ALBERO, you can enjoy the invigoration of fresh air even through your busy days.Clean air is a necessity of life. It’s time we can breath clean and breath free, every time, anywhere.

<p>We were craving a perfectly frozen coffee from our favorite cafe, but had zero desire to step out in the humid summer heat to go get it. After a few [failed] attempts with a blender, instant coffee and a bunch of ice, we had the idea for ICEY.</p>
<p>Making an icy drink with your blender at home is never quite the same as the refreshing frozen drinks you get at a restaurant. We wanted to recreate the smooth texture and the satisfying feeling of that first sip. And now that we have, we’re excited to share ICEY with you all.</p>

<p>E-Prism smart lamp is made by a Boston-based tech startup company called E-Green LLC founded in 2012. We design high tech, interactive, and innovative smart lighting technology. We’re a team of entrepreneurs who have a passion for technology but limited resources. Our purpose: facilitate the way people interact with light.</p>
<p><strong>About our CEO, Chia Ming Chen:</strong><br/>Chia Ming Chen was a principal system engineer at Raytheon and United Technologies before becoming an entrepreneur. He worked on missiles and multispectral sensors for airborne reconnaissance. He graduated from Columbia University with BS and MS in applied physics 1990.   </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Our Story</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1595889421/iuwntc9xszogphoh2kc8.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Our founder, Chia Ming Chen, grew up in a small village in rural China. There was no electricity and when going from place to place at night, he had to carry a kerosene lamp. Since he was just a child, sometimes he would trip over an unseen object and create a small fire. Due to his childhood experience with kerosene lamps, he wanted to create a lighting system that was safe, convenient, and cool. <br/>After 20 years working in aerospace industries, he decided to start a lighting company in 2012 called<strong> E-Green. </strong>He wanted to use the latest sensor technologies to make lighting more interactive, flexible, comfortable, and beautiful. To get there, he needed some luck and also some color... During a failed light mixing uniformity test in late 2017, a dazzling color mixing pattern not seen anywhere had been discovered. The<strong> E-Prism</strong> smart lamp was born!<br/>Our company filed a patent for this new technology in early 2018 and then built our first prototype. We learned from testing and analysis of the prototype that the colorful display had 7 colors, 16 color regions, twice that of the traditional color mixing method! We also learned the illumination angle was 120° degrees. We also found out its colors changed colors and created multiple color shadows when encountered an object. Finally, it could project multiple color images from the user-designed pattern. Based on these properties, we optimized our new prototype and phone app for various applications. We tested it in homes, hotels, restaurants, churches, wedding parties, and other venues. We were amazed when we watched how the E-Prism created a new world of light and shadow in these spaces, and we want to share this world with you.</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""> </h2>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">How will funding be used?</h2>

Finally, it could project multiple color images from the user-designed pattern. Based on these properties, we optimized our new prototype and phone app for various applications. We tested it in homes, hotels, restaurants, churches, wedding parties, and other venues. We were amazed when we watched how the E-Prism created a new world of light and shadow in these spaces, and we want to share this world with you.

We feel strongly that your information, even when it’s not personally identifiable, such as demographics, is not ours to share.So when we approached agencies about marketing the Beam campaign and they wanted information that we weren’t comfortable gathering, we knew we had to rethink our strategy. This invasive push from companies to gather user data goes against our core beliefs, and we feel that this type of parasitic relationship between companies and consumers is not necessary for success.As a matter of fact, we believe that the incredible success of our last campaign is proof that there is a way for companies to thrive without cannibalizing their users’ data. So in keeping our beliefs aligned with our business model, we have decided to forego a marketing agency and offer a FREE GIFT to the backers that share our campaign on social media. We’re sticking with what we know works for us, and for you too. Just comment to let us know if you've shared and we'll include the USB key with your order.  ""share the campaign and get a free key-shaped water & shock proof USB thumb drive with your pledge""   How do I connect Beam?Beam’s setup is strikingly simple, although it works best as a standalone router, it can work with any network configuration and internet service provider. The app will help guide you through setup process and Beam has built-in diagnostics.All of Beam’s security features will be on by default and be configured within the app. It really is that easy.We have 24/7 live support, we’re always here to help. FAQDo you allow peer-to-peer torrenting? Yes, you can download torrents on every single server!Do you log VPN traffic?For our VPN service, Forcefield, we have purposefully designed our server software to not log any traffic through our network. If we were subpoenaed we would not have any information to give. You can read more about our privacy policy here: https://forcefield.passel.io/privacyWill your lifetime Forcefield VPN subscription be available later?Due to popular demand the lifetime subscription is available to purchase on Indiegogo again. This is the last time you will be able to purchase a lifetime subscription and it will not be available after this campaign ends. What are Beam's specs? We have a full list of specs that can be viewed: https://passel.io/specsWill Beam work with my internet service provider?Yes, Beam will work with any network configuration and internet service provider.Can I use a third party VPN service with Beam?Beam will work with other VPN services just like our first device did, however, more advanced features like remote access and VPN filtering will not work since we aren't able to edit a third party VPN configuration.",30.0,1,"3 Campaigns

You receive your order and enjoy your new towels! Bath towels may be the hardest working members of your household. After all, we expect our towels and washcloths to keep us clean, dry us off and add to the look of our bathroom.  However, despite their versatility, towels are often underappreciated, with many people putting little thought into which type of towel they buy and bring home. Sento towels look, last and perform better.The right towel  If you think about it, you use a towel everyday. Whether after your bath, shower, washing your hands or at the beach. However, your choices at the store are confusing.  Cheap towels won't stay soft after a only few washes and fray apart easier. Even if you're willing to spend more, unfamiliar features and a wide spectrum of prices can make the options overwhelming. Finding the right towel can be a frustrating experience, but we don’t think that needs to be the case.Traditional towels are bulky, heavy, trap dirt, and take forever to dry. These inconveniences are something that we’ve all dealt with, and this led us to create the ultimate towel.  Say Hello to Sento....  That's where Sento comes in, introducing the towels as soft as a cloud.  After experimenting with dozens of towels, fabrics & types of cotton we’ve created an incredible towel that feels right in your bathroom. Combining the best elements of western and Japan towel making, and putting them into one great towel.The most absorbent, luxuriously delicate, odor resistant & 100% Japanese cotton towel. Welcome into your life fine craftsmanship in the pursuit of excellence in towel making. We know you'll love it!  JAPANESE CRAFTSMANSHIPThe Japanese have been perfecting the art of towel making for hundreds of years. Used by the high class of society in the 17th Century including the Samurai. They still carry on this tradition focusing on superior craftsmanship and simplicity.In modern Japan bath houses are a large part of the culture and we have taken inspiration from both the fine experience and the name 'Sento' which is Japanese for bathhouse.Composed of two textured sides stitched together in the traditional Japanese style. A cotton front with a gentle texture and a looped terry pile in the back. Using a premium woven stich rather than low grade sewing knit that regular towels use.  ""Created with painstaking attention to detail""Sento features:  
Larger size than your regular towel 
Dries 3x quicker 
Absorbs 3x its weight 
Soft & Durable 
100% Japanese Cotton 
Style and Decor 
Minimalist Design 
Anti-bacterial to eliminate odors  
Inspired by our passion for the finer things in life, Japanese craftsmanship and attention to detail. Many towels are made of cotton, but the look and feel of towels largely depends on what type of cotton is used. Towels designed and priced for everyday use are made of sub-standard cotton.Sento is made with 100% Japanese cotton which use longer, more-fibrous threads, meaning that each towel will have more moisture-wicking loops per inch. Sento fabric is ultra-soft, super-fluffy and designed for high-end spas and hotels with it's luxurious look and feel. “A better experience with every touch”Unlike mircofibre, which is a man made fabric, we use organic cotton which has a looser, velvety-soft texture. Unlike towels made from engineered fibers these natural fibers are better for your skin and extra absorbent. Best used for wringing water from wet hair without being too heavy.Sento towels are woven to create lots of little loops with high quality yarn allowing for a better spun affect. Giving the soft, silky and fluffy feel.

Worry-Free Watering. Sustainable Gardening.Precise peristaltic pumps and level sensors prevent flooding and ensure there is always liquid resting at the base of the farmbed, regardless of rotation. If the sensors ever detect low water levels, Rotofarm will alert you via the app so you can refill the base. Because Rotofarm is a fully enclosed system, there is minimal water loss from evaporation or drainage. Your plants get just the right amount of water they need — any excess returns to the reservoir and is recycled for the next rotation. As a result, Rotofarm uses 95% less water than traditional farming techniques. Nothing is wasted. ​The rotating farmbed maintains the perfect balance of water, nutrients and oxygen for your plants. No more root rot or dried out leaves. Rotofarm has your watering regiment completely covered. Never worry about watering your vegetables ever again.​
No Soil. No Mess. No Waste. 
The soilless Seed Podsare made from 100% biodegradable, plastic-free, soil-free coconut fibre. The coconut fibre retains moisture and humidity extremely well and doesn’t lose its integrity when wet or dry. These features help your plants stay hydrated and secure, even when they’re upside down. No soil also means no mess, no waste and no runoff! Grow your plants in the most efficient way possible without any hassle.
Easy To Access. Easy To Harvest.Rotofarm features a 180° swivel head that allows you to access it without strain. Simply move the garden opening towards you to harvest your herbs. The large opening and flexible head makes it easy to pick out your plants and prepare your meal for the day. Premium Luxury Materials. Designed To Last.Rotofarm is made with the highest-end quality materials for durability, longevity and aesthetics. Polished anodized aluminum and BPA-free silicones and plastics make up a majority of the base, internals and stand — creating a clean and strong build that holds the full density of your garden with stability and safety.A durable, beautiful white silicone shell protects the farmbed and keeps a modern, minimalistic aesthetic. Eclipse Cover — Maximize Light w/o Eye StrainThe optional Eclipse Cover is an innovative acrylic and aluminum cover that reflects light back into the farmbed, retains internal humidity, optimizes plant health and decreases eye strain as you enjoy your Rotofarm. The Eclipse Cover easily snaps on to Rotofarm through hidden neodymium magnets. The magnets auto-align the cover and securely attach it in an instant — no locks or latches needed. The cover keeps air moisture and humidity from escaping the enclosed environment. This helps conserve water, maximizes leaf respiration and maintains an optimal growing state.  The reflective interior mirror bounces and reflects light back to smaller, covered crops. This ensures all your herbs and vegetables, including those that may be blocked by larger plants, get the adequate lighting they need to thrive.The exterior smoked tint on the cover cuts out 60% of glare coming from the extra bright Sun+ light — reducing eye strain from the growth-optimized lighting. With the Eclipse Cover, you can conserve even more water, keep leaves healthier, and view your plants with ease.Rotofarm Pass — Continue The HarvestEach Rotofarm comes with a starter package of Seed Pods and Nutrient Concentrate. This is enough to get your first batch of produce growing and ready to eat. But what happens after?Don’t worry, we've got you covered! Before you checkout, be sure to add the Rotofarm Pass to your order. The Rotofarm Pass is a monthly subscription for Seed Pods and Nutrient Concentrate optimized for Rotofarm. Get your next batch started immediately after you harvest!Always be ready for the next cycle and keep the growth going! Traditional farming is terribly inefficient and wasteful. As a global community, we want to find ways to conserve our Earth’s precious resources while helping humanity thrive. With Rotofarm, we believe we can get one step closer to a more sustainable, more efficient, healthier future. Bace is an Australian-born biotechnology company comprising of horticultural and engineering experts that bring novel tech hardware and software to fruition whilst helping save the planet.",70.0,0,"1 Campaign

 Countless rounds of sketching, paper studies, rapids prototyping and metal 3D printing took Crownes from napkin sketch to feasible solution. Failing was not an option, but it took numerous attempts to succeed! Exploring different materials and testing different manufacturing techniques helped validate the idea and plan. 
*Plastic&Metal parts are not representative of final texture and color *These parts are for tooling and part quality tests.
These are images of the Leather Carry Case & Wooden Storage Case prototypes. We are testing size, manufacturability, material composition & construction methods. The Crownes Logo is a gold stamp embossed into the leather & the leather carry case magnetically closes along the metal edge trim.

You can even use this with foods that come in pre-packaged bags!         Let’s be honest.. how many times have we let the bulk of our groceries go bad in the fridge? That’s a waste of good food and precious money. Proper food storage with the help of our SEALVAC will allow you to buy in bulk and keep it fresh for much longer!     Our vacuum bags have been designed to completely seal your food from being exposed to oxygen and moisture in the air. This helps prevent oxidation which is one of the primary contributors to food spoilage. This means that your foods will stay fresh for 5 or even 10 times longer with SEALVAC.   * Duration of freshness may vary depending on the environment you are in when you use the SEALVAC.     How many times have we used unnecessarily clunky storage containers that make it super annoying to reach the food in the back? By vacuum sealing your foods with SEALVAC, you’ll save up to 3 times the amount of fridge space and make it easier to navigate around each shelf.       We launched the 1st generation of SEALVAC on a South Korean crowdfunding platform and raised $120,000. After our Korean backers received their SEALVAC’s and had a chance to test them out, they came back and gave us a 5 star rating! With their feedback, we’ve created the 2nd generation SEALVAC to share with the world through Kickstarter!     We get it. With the rise of other kitchen appliances like the air fryer, you’ve probably noticed that there’s less countertop space for you to cook or prepare your foods on.Not only is SEALVAC compact in size, it’s completely wireless which means that you can take it out, use it, and store it without having to compromise on long-term countertop space.       SEALVAC uses two Samsung SDI 18650 battery cells typically used in electric vehicles to power the vacuum mechanism. Experience the power of wired performance and wireless convenience in SEALVAC!     SEALVAC uses a low-noise motor that maxes out at 75db which is the same noise level as an average person to person conversation. After all that blender use, it’ll be nice to let your ears a break.     The SEALVAC features three different UV-C lights that will activate to sterilize while it’s vacuum sealing your food.   Have you ever noticed that plastic food storage bags and containers usually look like a mess near the opening because it makes contact with the food you’re putting in? SEALVAC goes one step further with the sealing process by using it’s three UV-C LED lights to sterilize the bag so that you can get that extra peace of mind when storing your food.            We used industry-leading 3D mechanical design techniques and mold technology to secure all of the main parts of the SEALVAC so that it stays intact even if it falls off your kitchen counter.   In the average vacuum sealing device, the temperature of the heating wire can rise to 300℉. We’ve discovered that when those devices are used in consecutive sessions, the plastic bags end up melting and causing the device to malfunction. That’s why with the SEALVAC, we chose to include a silicon plate with very low thermal conductivity under the heating wire in order to block any residual heat so that you can use the SEALVAC multiple times in a row without any risk to the device, the bag, or the food.      SEALVAC can also be used to elevate your cooking to a whole new level. By sealing your choice of food and marinade, you’ll lock in and intensify the flavors.You can also use a wine stopper to vacuum seal your wine as well.For your convenience, our device is compatible with third party food containers and sealing bags.Once you incorporate SEALVAC into your routine, you’ll experience a new paradigm of food storage and cooking.   SEALVAC sealing bags will be available both online and offline. You can also use other commercially available sealing bags as well.   With third party sealing bag rolls, you can create a sealing bag with your preferred length and seal it with the SEALVAC’s Sealing Mode.      The SEALVAC contains four intuitive buttons (MANUAL/AUTO/STOP/SEAL) that allow you to control the device with extreme ease. For normal foods, press the AUTO button and within seconds your food will be completely vacuum sealed and Sterilize. For finer control over the vacuum sealing process press and hold the MANUAL button until your desired amount of air has been extracted. Then, press the SEALING button to seal the bag. You can even store soups and other liquids by simply placing them in the bag and pressing the SEALING button. The UV LED lights will activate automatically during the sealing process. If you wish to activate the UV LED lights again after the sealing has completed, press and hold the STOP button for 3 seconds.   

 


 
         You can use any USB-C Type charging cable to charge the SEALVAC.    It takes a lot of energy to create an artificial vacuum. Because of this, it’s extremely difficult to create a vacuum packaging device that’s wireless. However, we made this possible by using two Samsung SDI 18650 battery cells which are used in Jaguar EVs to provide a power and stable output. With each full charge you’ll be able to seal 80 bags. Why go wired when you can go wireless now?    Since the SEALVAC isn’t necessarily a tall device, the ideal way to store it is to have device upright. This allows the device to be stored easily without taking too much kitchen space. Place it in any cabinet, or if you want to show it off SEALVAC’s beautiful design for your next dinner party, consider keeping it on your countertops.            Last year, we launched a crowdfunding campaign for the 1st generation SEALVAC (KUV-1) on a Korean crowdfunding platform and raised $120,000 in funding from 971 backers.After our supporters had a chance to properly test out the SEALVAC they came back and gave us an overall score of 5 out 5 stars for product performance. We’ve perfected the quality assurance of the SEALVAC and we’re confident that you’ll be satisfied with the 2nd generation SEALVAC!    After our first crowdfunding campaign for the 1st generation SEALVAC, we also used the opportunity to get feedback on how we could improve the product. We took the feedback and immediately spent the next several months to make drastic improvements. Click here to see a list of upgrades made from the 1st generation SEALVAC to the 2nd generation SEALVAC  Click here to see the Supplier's Declaration of Conformity for the 1st generation SEALVAC Click here to see the Supplier's Declaration of Conformity for the 2nd generation SEALVAC  Click here to see the test comparison results between the 1st generation and 2nd generation SEALVAC         In order to develop a product that meets the highest of standards, we applied for and received an FCC certification for our electrical components and a UL certification for battery stability.                       Through the collaboration of our CEO and product designers who collectively have over 20 years of product design experience and 30 years of hardware/software engineering, we were able to create a prototype of SEALVAC. During the modification phase, the SEALVAC went through 3 major instrument design modifications, countless quality tests, and hundreds of drop tests. Our team members worked tirelessly day and night to create a final version of the 2nd generation SEALVAC that would not disappoint our supporters. Now, with your help we will have the honor of sharing SEALVAC with the rest of the world.      Altos is a product launch consulting agency that specializes in helping b2c tech startups launch their products in the global market!

<strong>Why I Made Slim Caddies</strong>: With anything in life, being organized is the first step to being efficient. The first step in the right direction to living an efficient way of life is to get organized in the place you are daily — your home, your domain...  This is where it all starts... <strong>An organized home is the start to an optimized life</strong>... I created Slim Caddies out of necessity to be able to get rid of cabinet clutter (especially lids) but not take up valuable shelf space. I found bulky organizers to be counterintuitive to storage space. I then discovered door storage and shelf space don't have to be mutually exclusive (discovery of the slender, ""empty gap"" created by the face frame). That's when I decided to make an organizer that optimized your cabinet space but still provided enough room to accommodate a variety of potential items to be stored, looked great while being reliable at the same time, and could easily be attached without the worry of tools.  I then found out what was possible when you make an organizer as versatile as this. </li>

<strong>The Struggles and Going for It</strong>: Truth be told, I have actually been working on this project for several years, licensed it to large companies twice to only have the deals fall apart (maybe didn't see the full potential; who knows)...but still keeping the dream alive for a product I still believe brings a ton of value to a lot of people. This is the final test to see if others feel the same way about it. </li>
<li>
<strong>A Deeper Purpose</strong>: Sometimes it's all about taking a chance, putting yourself out there and going for it, seeing what happens and see if something great comes out the other side.

The Versatility - Use Slim Caddies anywhere, in any arrangement, for whatever it may be for your organizing needs.

The Ease of Attachment - No tools required! Quality double-sided adhesive provides easy, secure attachment.
  While there are numerous organizers meant for your cabinet door, we took the time to fully analyze the space provided by a cabinet along with potential items desired to be stored on your cabinet door. This helped us design an organizer optimized for your cabinet door with these considerations in mind. After doing this, we looked at problems with every other organizer on the market. The result was Slim Caddies, a door organizer made above the rest.

No bulkiness like other organizers that take up too much shelf space and take away valuable storage room (counterintuitive?) — leaving you unable to close your cabinet doors as well. 

No permanent holes or damage to your cabinets/desired attachment surface unlike other organizers on market. Slim Caddies make for a great solution when attaching to thinner surfaces such as a thin, cabinet door.

No unsightly hangers exposed when your cabinets are closed! 

No adhesive visible versus clear plastic organizers on the market as well.
      Slim Caddies are great for easy storage and accessibility to drink lids (Tervis, Tumbler, coffee lids, and many more) — all while taking up minimal/no valuable shelf space! Great for food storage containers as well! If we hit our stretch goal, we will come up with a larger Slim Caddy for those super large lids! Slim Caddies are great for organizing  spices boxes and smaller spice containers, without taking up valuable shelf space! Great for easy access to your favorite snack bars to keep you going through the day, all those koozies from over the years for parties, and many more pantry items!   Great for your bathroom cabinets too! Slim Caddies are great for your smaller accessories that can get lost in those jumbled storage bins! Great for storing note pads, pens, stationary, and other offices accessories in a cabinet where space can be a premium! Medicine cabinets as well for convenient access to those smaller medications and other accessories that otherwise get lost in a jumbled storage bin (especially when needed in an emergency).   Great for convenient access to all your smaller laundry stain accessories, your workbench, and many other areas as well! Organize Your Home, and Optimize Your Life! Quality Materials: Quality is #1.

My adorable whiskers never brush against it and never hurt because of whisker stress!  Enough Water Every DayKittySpring ensures I satisfy my daily need for a cup of freshwater (0.8 oz/lb) for 2 looong days. Now Mom and Dad don’t need to fill up my bowls and refresh the water in them several times a day. It’s a lifesaver for both of us!
 
 
Pawesome addition to any home interiorI simply can’t stop admiring the sleek design of my new fountain! It can be placed in almost any corner of the house and still look great. 
 
 Hard to knock overI’ve already paw-tested KittySpring. After hitting the light yet stable fountain a few times, it never flipped over! The fountain stands strong against any of my paw attacks. No more puddles of water, I promise.
 
KittySpring vs Regular bowls

 


 
Just watch world-known influencer Nala enjoying KittySpring. Simply in love with it … just like me, meow! 

 
 
 

 

 
 
 
 
The safest beverage of my life
Thanks to its built-in stainless steel filter, KittySpring constantly purifies my water serving it to me in the cleanest, freshest and tastiest form. Merely looking at this water makes my mouth water, murrr.

 
 Purremium, safe materialsKittySpring is made of FDA and RoHS certified materials, which means all of its components are  100% non-toxic, safe, and me-friendly. 
 
 

 
 

 
 
 Non-electric, just gravity I never knew what gravity was until I got my KittySpring. Meow I know — it’s a kind of thing that fills up my dish automatically once I lick a few drops … and it never adds to Dad’s bills. Meowgic!
 
 Silent like a sweet napKittySpring has no motor, which means no scary noises for a fluffy like me and a quiet night’s sleep for Mom & Dad. 
 
 
 
 

 
   Hard  to destroyThe durable materials make KittySpring my long-term water fountain: time and even naughtiest of tricks will never put it out of order.   No need to replace the filterThe built-in stainless steel filter lasts for years. This actually means 2 things: no troubles for me and no extra expenses for Mom and Dad.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Easy to installSimply unbox it, fill the bottle with water and place it in any corner of your house. No plugs, no cables needed!Track the water level easily With the transparent water bottle, Mom and Dad always knows when it’s time to refill the bottle of my favorite water. Easy to clean Cleaning KittySpring is super easy and super important. Make the dish and the bottle bacteria-free in seconds by simply taking them apart and washing in tap water using a brush or sponge and soap. Everything is also completely dishwasher-safe.   
 
  Single size. RRRight sizeKittySpring is purrfectly suited for both large cats like me and small kittens. Depending on the size of my fellow cats, KittySpring offers enough to drink for 1-2 days. And it will always stay fresh!
 
 Good for many cats  With its ultra-large dish, KittySpring can serve water not only to one but even two cats. The second cat is often my friend, Max. We just love drinking together from this fountain! Designed with comfort-loving cats in mindEach component of KittySpring is designed to combine useful with pleasant and comfortable. Thanks to its ergonomic design, drinking water from this fountain is almost like drinking from a natural spring.
 
 
 
  Two pawesome color options for your cat 
Crystal White
Emerald Green  
  

 

 

 

 


 
  

      Absolutely cat approvedKittySpring is approved by all representatives of my cat family. This means British shorthairs like me, Bengal and Persian cats, Sphynx, Scottish folds and all the rest just love KittySpring. 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 Dimensions and Weight    
 Our Pawesome StoryLast year my cat, Oscar, suddenly fell ill. The vet diagnosed the fluffy with dehydration and resulting kidney problems. The poor thing had to go through lots of pain and long treatment to regain his kitty self. We all worried about him pretty much as he was our team’s absolute favorite. And fortunately one bright day he started meowing happily again. We all sighed with relief and decided to join our efforts and design a water fountain that would help cuties all over the world avoid such problems and always stay hydrated. In designing KittySpring, we considered each detail of feline physiology to turn our fur friends’ drinking experience into the most enjoyable and comfortable one. We also tried to balance cats’ preferences for running and still water, creating an amazing gravity fountain perfect for any cat. With KittySpring, we hope to improve the life of our fluffies, keep them healthy and help loving cat parents like you take better care of them.

The new hand-held power scrubber effortlessly cleans even the most stuck up grime on any surfaces in your home. Hyper Lychee’s engineering and technology has been razor-focused on developing the most powerful compact scrubber that delivers impeccable cleaning results. 
The lightweight ergonomic design lets you catch a comfortable hold, while the three rotating power scrubbers make scrubbing fast and fun!

Press the ""on"" button on the bottom and attack that nasty grime. Achieve hyper-clean surfaces with zero effort!

Skadu comes with three different attachments, to cover a wide range of surfaces and levels of ingrained dirt and help you adjust to the most diverse requirements.


The Triple Head: 

Our PDT system (Planetary Distribution Technology) distributes the motor's power evenly to the three scrubbers while allowing them to rotate in opposite directions. And that powerful opposite rotation is exactly what helps you scrub stubborn grime so much faster with zero effort.

Scratch Free - Triple Head: 
A set of scratch-free pads ensures a thorough and safe cleaning of your delicate appliances.

The triple head Scrubbing pads can be easily interchanged as they are attached using industrial-grade velcro:

The Bottle Brush: 
Say goodbye to the grime at the bottom of your bottles - baby bottles, protein shakes, coffee travel mugs, soda stream (one of our beta testers loves it because he can clean the base of the soda stream bottle that never gets clean enough in the dishwasher), and about any container that you can think of. The bottle brush attachment is the extra power you need to give a thorough cleaning right to the bottom rim and scrub off that greasy grime build up. 

(This is an animated GIF - give it a second to load)
The bottle brush has a total length of 20cm and can reach the base of bottles, glasses, and containers of all types up to 35cm! 
 

The Copper Scrubber: 

The copper scrubber attachment is here to effortlessly remove burnt food from your BBQ and oven grill plates. When you need that extra level of toughness, this is the attachment. Why copper? Because it is incredibly tough and durable while being gentle to all surfaces and 100% recyclable.

We have been using this pan on a gas stove for the past years, without once cleaning the backside of it. So enough time for layers of oily hardcore grime to build up. Perfect! Challenge accepted, let's see Skadu's Copper Scrubber Attachment take on this scrubbing nightmare:


 
 

This is our secret breakfast recipe - Eggs, Marshmallows, BBQ Sauce & Tomatoes! Yum, we burnt it nice and long on our brand-new Stainless Steel Pan just to take up the challenge of cleaning it up without soaking the pan. Let's see Skadu clean this burnt grime up in under 60 seconds:


 
 

 
Since we couldn't find the perfectly up-to-the-task motor, we engineered our own. The Hyper Lychee motor technology can drive immense power (8kg.cm), just what you need to take the effort out of scrubbing tough jobs.

(This is an animated GIF - give it a second to load)
Skadu uses Hyper Lychee’s advanced Planetary Distribution Technology (PDT), which delivers the power of three scrubbers in one device. By enabling the scrubber disks to rotate in opposite directions, a multiplier effect is created to remove even the toughest grime with great speed. It channels 5x the scrubbing efficiency compared to its competitors. We have engineered this special motor for Skadu to have enhanced performance driving an on-load torque of 8 kg.cm. This motor combined with our PDT system, and even the nastiest grime vanishes fast without you having to lean in and apply pressure.
 

 

Visitors and industry experts at CES 2020 got their hands on Skadu and gave in their thoughts. It was the validation that Skadu and the team needed to move towards market launch.

 
Hyper Lychee's Skadu has been turning heads with its innovative approach. Silicon Valley-based accelerator Motwani Jadeja Foundation selected Hyper Lychee as one of the Top-5 most Innovative Technology Startups to exhibit at CES 2020. 
We were covered by various media publications and outlets for our work and participation

 

 
This April, We sent prototypes to beta testers to get real feedback and work out initial kinks. The results were amazing! We heard how it was super easy to clean up garden pots. We heard about how Skadu scrubbed clean a dirty bike. We heard about how it made cleaning therapeutic instead of a dreaded chore. More than anything, we heard time and again how simple Skadu was to use. We can't wait to spread the cleanliness and hygiene and see Skadu in many more households across the world.


 
 


 


 
 Unleash the full potential of Skadu using Skadu's App. The App features a community section where you can ask questions and share cleaning tips, tricks and experiences with all fellow Skaduers! The Skadu Store makes it convenient to purchase extra attachments, consumables, and get in touch with us for any query or request! Shipping, Taxes (and VAT) will be calculated and paid for towards the end of the campaign before we ship out to you. During these uncertain times, shipping costs have gone up significantly, however, we do believe that the prices will go down as the situation gets better globally.We have an internal, dedicated logistics team to ensure you get your Skadu without any errors and at the best price.Hence, we do not charge shipping right now, upon pledging is at the interest of our supporters as the prices today might be more expensive than that in a few weeks time.Here are our estimates of what shipping would be:If your country or region is not listed above click here:  Worldwide Shipping Estimates * Prices do not include taxes and VAT. That will be subject to the laws and regulations of each individual country.** We use customs friendly shipping and we ship worldwide.*** Please note that these are estimates and the actual costs of shipping may vary slightly depending on the circumstances.     At Hyper Lychee we are a family - literally! The two co-founders Hannan and Juzer are cousins and they've roped in their most talented friends and close family to build this company.One day Hannan walked into the kitchen of his great uncle and aunt who are both 60 years old in New Jersey and saw them scrubbing/cleaning by hand and they were struggling, he realized that this is a painful task not just for him but even worse for seniors - a task that we've just given into. After trying out various products that didn't work because they were either too slow or weak, he decided to build Skadu.He first ran the idea by Juzer and he said: ""Bro, let's do this - let's change the way everyone scrubs clean, this can really improve people's quality of life!"".And so Hyper Lychee was born!A 100 prototypes later the team is finally ready to bring the ultimate power scrubber to your homes.For business & press enquiries contact: juzer@hyperlychee.com ENVIRONMENTAL COMMITMENTSLong-lasting designWe have designed Skadu with the highest quality engineering processes - the top and bottom body of Skadu is ultra-sonic welded and shows no screws. This makes it absolutely impossible for water to seep through the body line making it secure from water damage. We use an official license of Solidworks 2020 Premium (Entrepreneurship Grant) to run various simulation tests on the durability of the product. We check for stress on gear assemblies, motor performances, and also for unexpected falls to the ground. We have also chosen the highest quality electronics in the market. We have tested a large range of electronics and ensured that the components chosen to build Skadu have survived and surpassed levels of usage that is way above that of the final product.Reusability and recyclabilityAll packaging for Skadu is made using environmentally friendly fiber paper and we only use vegetable ink for printing. All Skadu users will have the option of sending us back the copper scrubbers are exhaustion as they are 100% recyclable. All Skadu units can be sent back to us once their life-term ends so we can appropriately recycle and dispose what is not recyclable in a responsible way.Sustainable materialsAll cosmetic plastic parts in Skadu are made using recycled plastic. For instance, the main body & all the attachment exteriors. The scrubbing pads (tough & scratch-free) are made from recycled plastics The bottle brush is made from recycled plastics The copper scrubber is 100% recyclable All packaging Is eco-friendly fibre and vegetable ink.Environmentally friendly factoriesWe have made sure that the factory that we are working with are all abiding by the rules and regulations of the government to ensure that all waste is either recycled or disposed off correctly.Sustainable DistributionOur distribution partner is one of the largest crowdfunding fulfilment companies that take into account various factors towards sustainable shipping practices, one of them being optimizing the best routes to the last mile delivery.Questions about this project? Check out the FAQ section.",52.0,4,"1 Campaign

Ultimately, however, we all pull together and remain highly motivated in putting our joint mission of creating a greener world into practice.  Our aim is to produce sustainably at all levels. For us, ""producing properly"" starts with product development and goes all the way through to customer service. Pursuing fairness and ecology is important for us from start to finish, as is inclusion of all participants. Our ideas and products should be meaningful, clever and innovative, bring great pleasure to people, and they should be good for the environment. For example, we select companies for production that work as sustainably as possible and adhere to high social and ecological standards. The eco-friendly print shop ""Druckwerk"" in Nuremberg is such a gem for us – we have been working with them since our foundation. We source our seeds from various suppliers, almost all of which are based in Germany. And only organic-certified and open-pollinated seeds are used in our calendars, so we contribute to biodiversity. Plastic – no way José – not with us.   Besides sustainability, social fairness is also an integral part of our mode of production. That’s why we work together with the “Lebenshilfe Nuremberg”, a charitable association committed to the inclusion of people with disabilities in school and in the workplace. The collaborators support us in the production of our children’s book ""Emi Brillenbiene"" and our Plant Growing Kit.   Nothing more left to say than: Pot it like it's hot",31.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><strong>Risks and challenges</strong></h3>
<p>Our team has invaluable industry experience bringing hardware products to market from concept through manufacturing. Over our 20+ years in the industry, we’ve learned first hand about the challenges, and rewards, at each step in the process.</p>
<p>From Day 1, we stated our desire to ONLY launch a crowdfunding campaign if we were 100% confident in our ability to deliver the product we had envisioned. We are proud to say that our prototype has been through several iterations of testing and is now in the final stages of refinement. We have also engaged all the necessary partners to bring OneClock to life - musicians, parts suppliers, assembly, fulfillment and everything in between. </p>
<p>As with any hardware product - particularly when mass manufacturing - there is always a risk of delays, with possible issues arising in any point of the design, manufacturing and certification processes. However, we have identified risk areas, mitigated against these, and accounted for adequate testing time at every stage of our upcoming process. And, no matter how much we try and control all the variables, things can still go awry. If they do, we promise to give you full transparency into the issues and solve them in a way that leaves our backers happy and proud to support our company.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Environmental commitments</strong></h3>

We’re matching our high end materials and hand built quality with a robust and straightforward policy. Our 20-year warranty ensures OneClock will be free from defects in materials and workmanship and operate as advertised.</p>

All units will be shipped in a custom container engineered from high density cardboard and recycled protective foam.  Packages will be sent via UPS Ground, tracking included, for 1-5 day delivery at a cost of $14/clock. 
If state sales tax is applicable on your purchase, we'll follow up with you post-campaign with the cost and a method of payment.

Risks and challenges
Our team has invaluable industry experience bringing hardware products to market from concept through manufacturing. Over our 20+ years in the industry, we’ve learned first hand about the challenges, and rewards, at each step in the process.
From Day 1, we stated our desire to ONLY launch a crowdfunding campaign if we were 100% confident in our ability to deliver the product we had envisioned. We are proud to say that our prototype has been through several iterations of testing and is now in the final stages of refinement. We have also engaged all the necessary partners to bring OneClock to life - musicians, parts suppliers, assembly, fulfillment and everything in between. 
As with any hardware product - particularly when mass manufacturing - there is always a risk of delays, with possible issues arising in any point of the design, manufacturing and certification processes. However, we have identified risk areas, mitigated against these, and accounted for adequate testing time at every stage of our upcoming process. And, no matter how much we try and control all the variables, things can still go awry. If they do, we promise to give you full transparency into the issues and solve them in a way that leaves our backers happy and proud to support our company.
 
Environmental commitments
Lifetime warranties typically come with a lot of fine print that often amounts to nothing more than a marketing ploy. We’re matching our high end materials and hand built quality with a robust and straightforward policy. Our 20-year warranty ensures OneClock will be free from defects in materials and workmanship and operate as advertised.",26.0,7,"1 Campaign

These communications are encrypted using bank level 128-bit AES via an embedded hardware coprocessor.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493058759/mcye1urqyrfcbkddesus.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>The second layer of protection is the Dynamic Key.

Approved guests can unlock using fingerprint ID, key fob, or smartphone. You'll never have to wonder if you forgot to lock the door again.</p><p><strong>Privacy Lockout</strong>: In this setting, UL1 can only be unlocked by an administrator.

<li>
<strong>Ultraloq UL1: </strong>The simple UL1 perks is best for interior doors and standalone use, like home office, wine cellar, or private closets. This perk is great for Airbnb hosts that rent a single room in their house or want to keep certain rooms from being accessible by their guests. </li>
<li>
<strong>Ultraloq UL1 + Bridge: </strong>For those that want remote access and monitoring, the Bridge accessory is best. Smart home fans will want this connectivity.

www.u-tec.com!  Ultraloq UL1 Smart LockOpen your door through fingerprint identity, key fob or smartphone Bluetooth proximity sensor. Versatile, affordable & user-friendly smart home security allows multiple ways to access and the flexibility to grant access remotely to completely control who comes and goes in your home.  With the Ultraloq UL1 Smart Home Lock, we've used our experience from our previous generations of key-less entry systems and kept everything from installation to daily use simple, convenient and user friendly.  As Seen In:   Ultraloq Features at a GlanceUL1 is sleeker and smarter than our previous keyless entry system and packed with more technology.  Ultraloq UL1 is engineered with the patent pending technology for the newest and highest grade security:  An Upgrade From Our First GenerationWe've taken our first generation UL3 BT smart lock (pictured below) and packed more technology into a smaller design.  We've used our experience from retailing the UL3 model in Walmart and Home Depot to design our second generation key-less smart lock entry system with a few notable upgrades:

​SIZE  - Smaller, more compact and discretely disguised as a traditional lock.


PRICE - Cost half the UL3 and packs much more tech into a smaller body.


SETUP - Install with 5 screws on nearly any door in your home or apartment.

 $50K Stretch Goal Unlocked: AutoBolt Ultraloq AutoBolt provides you with heavy duty dual security through deadbolt and latch which is different than any other lock. AutoBolt (requires your existing deadbolt) is a smart deadbolt interior part that connects wirelessly to your UL1 and grants access with one touch for convenience. When you gain entry through fingerprint, key fob, or Bluetooth, your AutoBolt will automatically unlock. Check the lock status at any time with the smartphone app, so you'll never worry about leaving the door unlocked again.  AutoBolt is designed to fit both the UL1 colors beautifully with black color and satin nickel highlights.      Use Your Unique Fingerprint Your fingerprint is completely unique to you. It cannot be stolen, forgotten, or impersonated, making for the utmost security. Ultraloq uses the most sophisticated biometric fingerprint technology available today for identification in half a second!  The fingerprint sensor will wake automatically once you place your finger on it and is conveniently positioned to accompany your natural hand position. One seamless action allows you to wake the sensor, read your fingerprint, and unlock your door.   Bluetooth Proximity DetectionThe Bluetooth compatibility allows you to ditch your keys for your smartphone! Because you already carry your phone with you everywhere, we've made it even more useful. You'll never have to worry about losing your keys, forgetting combinations or unauthorized duplicating of your key.     Quick Tap Entry For those who don't use a smartphone, UL1 can be unlocked with a contactless key fob. Once you present the key fob in the vicinity of handle, the door will instantly unlock. This key fob utilizes 13.56MHz frequency smart technology for fast and accurate identification. If you ever lose your key fob, you can easily delete in the app so it will no longer have access.     Monitor Access RemotelyThe Ultraloq app is designed for iOS and Android devices and gives you easy door access and tracking abilities. You can view the access logs in the app for detailed information about who has opened your door, at what times, and how they gained access.  Add or delete users any time with the ability of adding up to ​100 users.   5 Screws & Done!Ultraloq UL1 is a painless installation process with no wiring and no drilling. The simple installation takes minutes and only five screws. The handle is reversible for compatibility with both left handed and right handed doors.   UL1 fits any standard American door of regular thickness, regardless of material.     When Safety is ParamountWe don't take security lightly, on our homes or in our data storage. That's why Ultraloq uses a dual encryption process. The Ultraloq uses Bluetooth 4.0 to communicate between your smartphone and the UL1 lock. These communications are encrypted using bank level 128-bit AES via an embedded hardware coprocessor.  The second layer of protection is the Dynamic Key. This key code is randomized for every single data transfer. Even if somebody were able to capture the AES encrypted data, the Dynamic Key protection would make it impossible to for them to unlock your door.    Bridge Your Home to Your LifeWith the optional Ultraloq Bridge upgrade, you can control entry to your UL1 or previous generation, UL3. Simply plug the Bridge into an outlet in your home, and you can grant access to guests and visitors via an eKey for specific dates or periods of time with no monthly fees! Bridge is ideal for granting temporary access in any situation. You never have to leave work to rush home again. With the Bridge accessory, you can even receive smartphone notifications when someone opens your door for ultimate safety and peace of mind.    Specify Your Level of SecurityUL1 features three different locking statuses for your convenience. You can set your lock to one of the following settings:Auto Relock: UL1 will automatically relock after every time the door is used. Approved guests can unlock using fingerprint ID, key fob, or smartphone. You'll never have to wonder if you forgot to lock the door again.Privacy Lockout: In this setting, UL1 can only be unlocked by an administrator. This setting is ideal for when you leave on vacation or business trip.Free Passage: When you're entertaining or know that there will be people in and out of the house frequently, you can set your UL1 to this setting for free passage.      Resilient Enough for Outside DoorsThe UL1 is designed to be weather resistant so that you can use it on in and outside facing doors. The fingerprint sensor is completely waterproof, scratch proof, and dust-proof, protected by a layer of quartz with high hardness. The solid zinc alloy lock body can endure harsh winters and rainy monsoons. The fingerprint sensor and the outside lock body is completely sealed to keep water and dust from penetrating any electronics.     Match Your Home AestheticUltraloq UL1 is thoughtfully crafted with style and functionality in mind. This handle looks clean and compact on any door with smooth surfaces, curved edges, and narrow size. While the main function of UL1 is safety, we wanted to create a lock that brings usability, simplicity and elegance together.    UL1 Fits Any Door, in Size & Style!     One Year Battery LifeTo ensure that you're never locked out because of a dead battery, UL1 operates on a dual battery system as well as sends your phone warnings if the battery is low. Thank to Bluetooth 4.0's ultra low power consumption technology, Ultraloq can be powered by four AA batteries with more than one year of battery life through regular use.   Two AA batteries are in the indoor door handle & two AA batteries are in the outdoor handle.    Real Time Light ResponseThe tricolor LED indicator shows authorized or denied access, Bluetooth connectivity, and locking status.    Use Cases

Hands Full: Never worry about fumbling around for your keys again. Ultraloq is completely keyless, so you don't have to worry about carrying anything with you. 

Forgot to Lock Your Door: No worries! Ultraloq UL1 can auto lock your door for you so your home is always safe.

Any Room: Ultraloq UL1 is ready for indoor or outdoor use but also can be used on any room inside your house that you want to keep private, like offices, wine cellar, or storage room.

Guests: With UL1 and Bridge, you never have to leave work to let in the maintenance worker or your dog walker. Bridge lets you grant access to to guests, the babysitter, or a service provider from anywhere for any amount of time.

Airbnb Home Owners: UL1 and Ultraloq Bridge are the perfect accessories for Airbnb hosts, giving you the ability to grant access to your guests for the period of their stay without physically being there. You can save time and money, while keeping your guests happy and your home safe.

<h3>Awake but motionless</h3>
<p>Most modern dogs do not get enough mental stimulation. Yes, it’s bad. And the worst is not as you may think, chewed up furniture or excessive barking and whining. These are of course bad, but no, the worst part is that the majority of dogs don't manifest at all. They simply give up. They become passive, bored and depressed - awake but motionless. The condition has been coined by scientists as learned helplessness, and it leads to poor life quality, obesity and premature death. What makes this particularly bad is that we - the otherwise good and loving dog owners - are pretty much unaware that our dogs are in fact unhappy. We may even be saying: ""I am so proud, my dog is so obedient and calm - he/she's relaxing all day long and can stay home alone for hours without any problems"". And truth be told, he/she is more likely to be slowly but literally dying from boredom and stress from being alone. Ouch.</p>

<p>This is what keeps us up at night, this is why we work so hard and this is why we have created Go Dogo!</p>
<h3>Why you will want it</h3>
<p>The best thing you can do to mentally stimulate your dog is positive-reinforcement training, which means: Teach your dog tricks for positive rewards. Activity toys such as the Kong and brain-games made out of wood or plastic or cloth are also good - and you should use them as much as you can too. They are good because your dog can work for treats independently of you, which as mentioned above builds a solid self-confidence. They may also be used to help teach your dog that being alone can be nice. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the existing solutions give no feedback and they have only limited (if any) progression - they are either too easy or too hard. On top of that they all have physical parts that must be pushed, pulled, licked or chewed, which potentially can become hazardous - such as splinters in the belly or mouth. So, it is usually not recommended to allow your dog to interact with them during home-alone time. </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/_lwx5uHylNU?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></h2>
<p>Go Dogo is all about the right level of difficulty, feedback and no-touch gaming! Our secret is: Computer vision! The game constantly registers what your dog is doing, and in combination with the intelligent play-logic this enables your dog to learn how to “trick” the system to deliver a treat. In the beginning it is extremely easy - the sweet AI instructor simply says “Dogo” and out comes a treat. Slowly it becomes harder, and in the end your dog will know a lot of different tricks and combinations. On top of this, new levels will be added remotely via the system updates - so Go Dogo will continue to be interesting and stimulating. </p>
<h3>Will it work for your dog?</h3>
<p>If your dog likes treats: YES! Go Dogo will work for all dogs - young or old, big or small, fluffy or not. It adapts to your dog's learning pace and preferences. But, the game can only be used by one dog at a time. If you have more than one dog, you will have to create a profile for each of them and make sure that only one dog at a time is playing Go Dogo. Otherwise the non-playing dog(s) may be in the way and perhaps even steal a treat that was earned by the playing dog. Believe us, we have seen it happen more than once! </p>

<h3>How to use Go Dogo</h3>
<p>Go Dogo will be connected via HDMI to your home TV - in this way the AI instructor can give your dog visual and audible cues and feedback. The front and the side-camera in combination will make sure that your dog is ""seen"" in the game zone.</p>
<p>As mentioned above the majority of dogs get a lot out of performing tricks for treats, and this is why Go Dogo uses treats or food as the motivational factor. Every time your dog completes an exercise, the main unit will release a treat, while the AI instructor praises your dog. Many dogs will, like Cooper in the movie above, gradually begin to like the game so much, that they are gladly playing for their normal food. And while the game becomes harder your dog will have to work a bit more to earn a reward. </p>

<p>According to experts in dog training the need for mental stimulation is highly individual, but each time you want to teach your dog something brand new, you should not over do it. Playing Go Dogo around 10-20 minutes a couple of times a day is fine for most dogs.</p>
<p>The game can become frustrating - but that is normal during learning. Your dog is anticipating a treat - and will spend a lot of mental energy trying to figure out how to get. It is important that you, the owner, allows this. Also, do not worry - the game is designed in collaboration with experts, so frustration is guaranteed to be short-lived. The game always ends on a high - which is your dog doing an exercise that it knows. Your dog will first learn to wait (a few minutes), and gradually - or in some cases all of a sudden - he/she figures out what to do to get the treats to come out faster. </p>

<h3>How we got to Go Dogo</h3>
<p>In the summer of 2016, CEO Hanne Jarmer, realized that she was finding it increasingly difficult to keep coming up with new ways to entertain her two whippets, Leo and Louis. This motivated her to create a solution - and after some simulations, research and searching for suited co-founders. Go Dogo was officially founded in the summer 2017. Less than 5 months later the first prototype was ready. </p>

<p>Having our office in FutureBox on campus at the Technical University of Denmark has given us access to relevant technologies such as 3D printers. This makes prototyping a lot easier. We have printed and tested several versions of the system to get ready for production.

</div></div>","Go Dogo is an Artificially Intelligent (AI) interactive activity toy that will help you exercise your dog's mind - using treats as motivation.

 
Dogs enjoy and build self-confidence by earning their food. Go Dogo will allow them to solve stimulating challenges in exchange for food rewards. The game revolves around positive reinforcement-based training - mental enrichment and treats.

Go Dogo will help you keep your dog mentally healthy - and happy!
Awake but motionless
Most modern dogs do not get enough mental stimulation. Yes, it’s bad. And the worst is not as you may think, chewed up furniture or excessive barking and whining. These are of course bad, but no, the worst part is that the majority of dogs don't manifest at all. They simply give up. They become passive, bored and depressed - awake but motionless. The condition has been coined by scientists as learned helplessness, and it leads to poor life quality, obesity and premature death. What makes this particularly bad is that we - the otherwise good and loving dog owners - are pretty much unaware that our dogs are in fact unhappy. We may even be saying: ""I am so proud, my dog is so obedient and calm - he/she's relaxing all day long and can stay home alone for hours without any problems"". And truth be told, he/she is more likely to be slowly but literally dying from boredom and stress from being alone. Ouch.

This is what keeps us up at night, this is why we work so hard and this is why we have created Go Dogo!

<p>The quest for the perfect water skimmer started many years ago. We have a 55-gallon aquarium with plants and fish, and the surface was always coated with an oily residue. We tried several store-bought solutions, but none of them seemed powerful enough. Then we moved on to do it yourself innovations that we discovered on YouTube. While we finally found one that worked, it was not attractive, and it was difficult to clean.</p>
<p>We decided to create a Black Hole Skimmer® to keep the surface water in our aquarium clear and beautiful. So, we miniaturized our swimming pool model and used a Marineland MaxiJet 400 Powerhead as the pump. Wow, did this work. It was much more elegant than our Do It Yourself model and we were also able to easily clean the filter and change the media.</p>

<p>We are doing Indiegogo to introduce ourselves and our products. We are hoping to find out that you find our Black Hole Skimmer® for Aquariums as fascinating as we do, and of course are hoping that you purchase one or back us. While we currently have enough funds to manufacture and package skimmers before summer 2021, we also want to get the community involved. We want everybody to be excited about our skimmers, so we can later move into swimming pools and other bodies of water. We even eventually want to build a model to clean oil and chemical spills.</p>
<p>We are hoping that this is just the start, and we are hoping that you will be part of our goal to clean water everywhere. We also want to know that people are happy to have our Black Hole Skimmer® in their aquariums, and this is not something that we will take for granted. To show our appreciation, we will include precut filter media with your purchase. We are currently testing media and we will also accept and appreciate your suggestions.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;color: blue;""><strong>Environmental Impact</strong></h3>Your contribution and belief in our Black Hole Skimmer®, will help us to not only create very effective aquarium water skimmers, but will also help us to apply these designs to saving energy. Swimming pools consume a lot of energy because of the way traditional water skimmers operate. Our Black Hole Skimmer® can clean the entire surface of a swimming pool using only a fraction of the energy of current solutions. When you purchase our skimmer for your aquarium, you will also be helping us to prove the technology will also work well in pools and other larger bodies of water.<div style=""text-align: center;""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/GL9vqXtK418?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<div>We believe that our skimmers could be very effective at cleaning up oil or chemical spills in our our oceans and lakes. We also believe that that using our skimmers in swimming pools will greatly reduce the amount of energy needed to clean the surface of swimming pools. </div>

<div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;color: blue;""><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h3>
<p>We have been working on the Black Hole Skimmer® design for aquariums for quite some time. We have a final prototype, and we are engineering the parts for manufacture. We also have the funds lined up to get up to 2,000 skimmers manufactured and packaged, so there is little risk. We are positive that everybody that orders a skimmer will receive their skimmer. The biggest risk is that the manufactured part may not behave as well as the prototype, in which we will have to modify the part. Modifying the part may delay the delivery of your skimmer, but be assured that we will deliver the highest quality device.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;color: blue;""><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3>
<p>Our current designs work with Marineland Maxi Jet 400 Powerheads. We chose Marineland because they have high quality products and have been around for many years. If you feel that we should work with other powerheads, then please let us know the brand and model. We will strive to create an adapter that will allow you to use the Black Hole Skimmer® with your requested power head. Also, please let us know what types of media may work well in our skimmer. The skimmer body is about 2.7 inches (68.5 mm) in diameter and around 3.18 inches (81 mm) deep. We hope that these dimensions will allow the use of a variety of filter media.</p>

<p>If you are a company that provides high quality filter media, then please let us know what filter media products that you can offer for use in the Black Hole Skimmer.</p>

 Instead of telling you how to sit, BeYou transforms so you can finally sit comfortably in any position that feels great… to be you.Sitting on your BeYou is just as intuitive as tossing and turning while you sleep. Your body will naturally tell you when it’s time to switch positions.Then, all you have to do is listen to it. BeYou does the rest. Simply adjust and in only a few seconds, the possibilities are endless!With your BeYou transforming chair, you can do waaay more than just sit.You’re free to work on your laptop, play on your phone, lounge to relax, take a zen moment to yourself, do a few yoga poses and even take a power nap.  BeYou is more thoughtful than a glass of wine on a bad day and more versatile than a Swiss army knife.    Your BeYou comes with... wings. Yeah, for real. Kinda! They support you no matter how you choose to sit. They are plush and comfy like grandpa's favourite armchair, yet look super sleek and modern.  They’re incredibly easy to adjust. It only takes one click! And you can do it all while sitting down. Put them all the way up, open them flat or anything in between. Whatever works for you.Each wing can be set in 5 positions. Use them as armrests, backrest, support for your knees, the perfect place to put up your feet or even as yoga blocks.   The adjustable backrest lets you slide it up and down so you get additional back support, even for taller people. Plus, this lets you adjust the height when you're using it as a seat or table.  The backrest adjusts in all the right places to make sure BeYou feels like home. Move it backwards or forwards, up or down and even tilt it slightly.But this is so much more than a backrest. When horizontal, it unlocks a whole new list of ways you can sit, relax or work on your BeYou.   Use it as a laptop stand or a table that’s perfect for your lunch. Or what might be the world's comfiest elbow pad. It fits under your desk and makes typing on your keyboard much easier.No, we’re not done. You can use the backrest as a seat and finally sit comfortably with your legs crossed in a chair made for you. Rest your knees or feet on the seat and play around to find what feels good.    With so many of us working remotely now, you can trust that BeYou is perfect for your home or office setup.The minimalist and timeless design looks great in any room. BeYou transforms to help you sit better no matter if you’re working or relaxing... or both.When you can change your position easily so you feel more comfortable, your level of focus and productivity skyrockets.   At home, you can relax and put your feet up, take a moment to unwind and meditate or simply sit comfortably while watching a movie.BeYou is also perfectly tailored for your home office. Now you don’t have to move from the couch to the bed then to the floor, trying to find the perfect work spot.To stay focused and productive, it's best to stick to a dedicated work space in your home. But you don't have to stick to one position. With BeYou, you can sit however you want.BeYou fits under your desk no matter how you like to sit: lounge, cross legged and even backwards.  Your chair is made with top quality oak veneer. This makes your BeYou very strong, stable and durable. Because mother nature is part of the BeYou, we are committed to do our part for mother nature. That's why we will plant 1 tree for every chair sold. The custom built quick release hinges are at the heart of BeYou’s design. They’re super easy to use and help you transform your chair in a matter of seconds. Bums and backs around the world will be thrilled to sit on BeYou’s extra comfortable high-quality foam cushions.We made BeYou so you can use it for years to come. That's why we use a special cushion fabric that’s stain resistant and withstands wear and tear exceptionally well. BeYou comes with a wide base and heavy duty auto-locking wheels that adapt to your weight placed on the chair. When you’re sitting down, it’s easy to move around with just a push of your legs. When you get up to get a coffee, the chair stays put because the wheels automatically lock in place.The wheels work great on both carpet and hard surfaces. And you can use the wheels or the fixed casters (included in your package).   The BeYou wheel base is up to 40% wider than traditional chairs. Plus, we shifted the piston 4x further back compared to traditional chairs, which also shifts its centre of gravity, giving it excellent stability.   That way, you can rely on the base and backrest to support you without compromise, even when using the backrest as a seat in the highest positions. You probably googled ""ergonomic"" at some point. But do you actually know what it means? It's actually pretty simple. It's something designed for efficiency and comfort in a working environment. BeYou easily checks all the boxes, which is why it's a truly ergonomic chair made for how you sit.  When you're sitting for long hours every day, back pain is quite common. Because on BeYou it's so easy to change positions, you get a lot of variety. You're not forced to sit in one position, so there's no more stiffness.BeYou's special backrest is a natural prompt for you to stay mindful of your posture. It's a great reminder to sit up straight on your own, without leaning back on a backrest that usually prompts us to slouch a little bit in our chairs.And for those intense deep work sessions when you need the perfect support, the curved cushions frame your body better and the backrest goes up as high as 43cm / 16.9"". We believe your peace of mind is important. BeYou comes with a 1 year warranty, so you can focus on making the most of it and discovering your favourite positions. Watch The Video!

<img class=""lazy"" data-pin-nopin=""true"" data-src=""http://i64.tinypic.com/9fzh8n.png"" src=""""/><p><br/><strong>What is Caia 2.0?</strong><br/>After our original Indiegogo campaign in Fall 2016 we got as much input from our backers as we could. We realized the original Caia design needed to be more flexible, so our amazing engineering team put all of their time and effort into developing a design that would truly reflect the needs of our customers. Introducing Caia 2.0! Our new and improved Caia design boasts a wider range of angles to redirect sunlight, metal instead of plastic housings for better outdoor durability, no external sphere, a reflective mirror made of safety glass, a more accurate sensor for pointing Caia, a foldable design that lowers shipping costs, and an even more beautiful look and feel (at least, in our opinion).</p> <p><strong>How durable is Caia?</strong><br/>Caia has strong metal housings to protect her delicate robotic systems and sensors. She is weather resistant and can handle a reasonable amount of rain and snow during the winter months. Her reflective mirror is also made of safety glass, so even if it does get broken it will stay in place and continue to reflect sunlight (though in a slightly more ‘disco ball’ manner) until you have time to replace it.<br/> </p>
<p><strong>How much sunlight does Caia need to work?</strong><br/>Caia works best with direct sunlight however, she will redirect any available light so even diffuse light or cloudy skies can provide some illumination to a dark room.<br/> </p>
<p><strong>How far can Caia reflect light?</strong><br/>In tests, Caia has illuminated areas up to over 100 feet away (30 meters). It’s entirely possible to go further, but Caia’s reflected light diffuses the further she has to go.<br/> </p>
<p><strong>How many hours of light can expect from Caia?</strong><br/>8-16 hours a day depending on the available sunlight hours, time of the year and local geography.<br/> </p>
<p><strong>Will Caia provide heat or just light?</strong><br/>Caia uses a flat mirror so the light reflected is not concentrated like a magnifying glass. The light Caia sends would be equivalent to the light that shines in through your window so your home will feel natural warmth but she can’t fry ants or start fires.<br/> </p>
<p><strong>How is shipping and tax handled?</strong><br/>We are shipping to backers all over the world so taxes or duties vary from country to country. All of the shipping fees may be assessed during and after the campaign. We will follow up with our backers before shipping to confirm mailing address as well as shipping costs. Please note that the backer is responsible for all local taxes including but not limited to sales tax, VAT, GST, and import duties, as apply to them in their respective countries. We will do our best to reduce those fees to keep your costs down.<br/> </p>
<p><strong>What kind of warranty do you offer on Caia?</strong><br/>Caia comes with a 1 year warranty that covers software, mechanical and component failures. Should you encounter any of the above problems just contact our customer support and we are happy to do everything to address the problem, even sending you a brand new Caia. Unfortunately, however, we cannot cover issues related to normal wear and tear or accidental damage.<br/> </p>

Email us at information@solenica.com</li></ul></div>","Caia is a smart natural lighting robot that brightens up your home with real sunlight, sending the sun where you need it most - all day long.Just set her in a sunny spot inside or out, point in the direction you want to light, and Caia does the rest. And you never need to plug her in or recharge because she’s solar-powered!   UPDATE: Production Has Begun! Production and preliminary delivery have begun! We are now going through final fixes with the help of feedback from our earliest supporters (including custom part color, as you can see in the photo on the left).   


Most of us spend over 90% of our lives inside. Some have the privilege of sunny homes but many of us don’t have enough natural light during the day to day.



Winters can cause seasonal depression and cold weather often lasts longer than we’d like. Who wouldn’t want to boost their Vitamin D and serotonin levels with more sunlight?



The trade off of living in a big city is having to rent small apartments where there just isn’t enough natural lighting and we don’t have the option to install skylights or solar tubes.



Interior designers suggest lots of decorating tricks to brighten dark rooms, from using vibrant paint colors to even more artificial lighting, but nothing can beat real sunlight.



We love growing plants indoors but we don’t always have the natural light available for them to thrive in certain areas of our house. That herb garden you’ve always wanted doesn’t have to be out of reach.

 

Caia is a long-term, low-maintenance solution for bringing real sunlight into your home. No installation, no construction, no supervision necessary — a powerful, cost-effective solution to your low-light problem.

And don't forget Caia's Universal Mount! Our Universal Mounting System makes Caia easier to use than ever before. With wall, balcony, and pole configurations, you can place Caia exactly where you need her.
 

 
   
 

 Maybe one Caia is not enough to solve your home's illumination problems? Maybe your room is too large, or you simply have too many rooms to light up with sunlight. We've got this! This is why we created the Caia 3-pack, order two Caia's and get one FREE so you can enjoy three times more sunlight at a reasonable cost to you. Redeem and enjoy!

 

Caia’s elegant design has an expert Italian eye behind the aesthetics. Clean, minimal and won’t detract from your home decor. Great engineering never looked this good.
 

Who makes Caia special? Our incredible robotics engineering team, of course! With experience at the European Space Agency, Singularity University, and Cambridge, they are working day and night on Caia so she's ready to illuminate your home or office.
 
    
 

Beta testers seeing Caia’s magic for the first time. Wow. 

Our beta testers have nothing but incredible things to say after watching their homes and workspaces transformed.
 
 
Caia constantly takes light intensity readings using her sensor array, or ‘pointer’. Once you aim the pointer where you want to redirect sunshine, Caia's proprietary algorithm uses the light intensity values to position her motorized mirror at the correct angle to illuminate your chosen destination. As the light source (aka the sun) moves through the sky, Caia makes micro adjustments to the mirror position to maintain the perfect angle of reflection that keeps the natural light flowing to the same place all day. And the best part…the sunlight she reflects also powers her. No external energy source required!
 
Last but not least, she was designed with a foldable design that allows for easy, inexpensive shipping. And who doesn't like to pay less for shipping?

What about the Universal Mounting System? This part of the design is an add-on but feels like a natural extension of the core Caia design. Safety was our first and foremost focus while developing the design and our Mechanical Engineers spent months crafting out the best and safest mechanical solution.

<p>The clogging of filters and other common vacuum cleaner problems can lead to a loss of vacuum suction. Cyclone suction involves spinning air at a very high speed up to 145,000 RPM per minute to separate dust from the airflow before it gets anywhere near the filters, then throw dirt and dust out of the airflow and into the collection bin. This technology doesn't clog and lose suction that you don’t even have to replace the filter, but it’ll still maintain the highest efficiency and cleaning performance continuously. </p>

<p>When dust enters the vacuum cleaner at high speed, it rubs against the inner wall of the vacuum cleaner and the roller brush, etc. to generate static electricity. As the material of the vacuum cleaner itself has a certain degree of insulation, the generated static electricity cannot be released.

</div></div>","SHUNZAO MOW (Z12 Pro) is the world's first lightweight cordless vacuum cleaner with hair self-cutting technology, bringing you the world-class cleaning power to best meet all your cleaning needs. The 5-layer filter system effectively improves the filtration without reducing the airflow and losing suction, saves you from buying additional filter replacement. Remember we aim to provide the cleaning solution for the problem that plagues you for many years, instead of selling accessories. SHUNZAO MOW (Z12 Pro) comes with multi-functional accessories for carpets, bedding, car seats and corners, etc., easily clean everywhere needed! Save you time and effort! It also has an advanced LCD screen display that monitors system performance and shows available power, suction and blockage reports in real-time.
 

 

    
Long human or pet hair easily gets wrapped around the traditional brush roll while it is rotating, which will damage the brush roll. The cutting hair design patent of SHUNZAO MOW (Z12 Pro) is equipped with horizontally opposed blades that can cut tangled hair quickly and efficiently. It prevents long human and pet hair from wrapping around the roller and clogging the hose. SHUNZAO laboratory has launched the first hair self-cutting cordless vacuum cleaner after 4 years of research and repeatedly testing of more than 7,000km of hair.


There is a pair of ""scissors"" on our roller brush, cut and suck all the hair debris anytime anywhere. 

 
  
  
The 190AW ultra-strong suction power provides more thorough and efficient cleaning. It produces a maximum of 27,500PA suction power which is more effective in getting rid of stubborn dirt and grime hidden away in your carpets and tricky corners, in between pieces of furniture, under your bed and so on.
 
  

The clogging of filters and other common vacuum cleaner problems can lead to a loss of vacuum suction. Cyclone suction involves spinning air at a very high speed up to 145,000 RPM per minute to separate dust from the airflow before it gets anywhere near the filters, then throw dirt and dust out of the airflow and into the collection bin. This technology doesn't clog and lose suction that you don’t even have to replace the filter, but it’ll still maintain the highest efficiency and cleaning performance continuously. 
 
  

This SHUNZAO MOW (Z12 Pro)'s original 3-in-1 brush roller easily cleans and works well on different floor types: low pile carpets, long pile carpet, hardwood floor, tile and marble, etc., leaving no dirt behind.

More Real Test About SHUNZAO MOW

In addition, an intelligent power management system ensures the battery is used to its full capacity each time.

Once the category is identified, the AI engine will further analyse the intent and the classification by working tightly with the Media Indexer. As a result, the content AI engine will create 20 to 25 parameters on an average for any given query and hands this off to the Deep Search Engine.

A sheep's foot design essentially draws the spine (""backstrap"") down to the front, with very little clearance above the horizontal cutting plane when the blade is resting naturally from heel to forward cutting edge. Providing a more linear cutting edge, the Santoku has limited ""rocking"" travel (in comparison to a German/Western-style chef's knife). The Santoku may be used in a rocking motion; however, very little cutting edge makes contact with the surface due to the extreme radius of the tip and very little ""tip travel"" occurs due to the short cantilever span from contact landing to tip. An example of this limitation can be demonstrated in dicing an onion—a Western knife generally slices downward and then rocks the tip forward to complete a cut; the Santoku relies more on a single downward cut and even landing from heel to tip, thus using less of a rocking motion than Western-style cutlery.  </p><div data-id=""15698816""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p style=""text-align: center;""><img alt=""Titanium Santoku"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://www.youkauf.net/images/projects/sternsteiger-titanium/titanium-santoku-knife.gif"" src=""""/></p></figure></div><h1>Technical details: </h1><ul>

The unique characteristic of a hollow edge is several small cavities that get hammered into the blade in close proximity to each other. The purpose of these cavities is to prevent the adherence of particularly thin, greasy or otherwise sticky clippings, such as ham or cheese, on the knife and thus also to cut very thin slices without damage. </p><div data-id=""15763222""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1492454846/dy6qqvzxshrh5yfeov54.jpg"" src=""""/></p></figure></div><p>This property is due to the reduction of the blade surface which comes into contact with the cut material. In the case of pure cheese knives, there are even holes in the blade instead of the cavities, which achieve the same effect. However, since the soft or very thin material can be entangled in the holes, holes are not universally applicable. Cavities, on the other hand, are a good compromise between reducing the surface of the blade and stabilizing the cut material. </p><div data-id=""15912664""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p style=""text-align: center;""><img alt=""Sketch with old angle on the left, new angle on the right"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1492454847/lhvgbllqbubbfsk5etyz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

These characteristics make this material irreplaceable in the aerospace industry, but it reached out much further than that. Sternsteiger has combined this unique material with a core of stainless steel, crafted in the city of blades, therefore creating a unique kind of knives that totally change the game. The new Titanium Series is Sternsteiger's 2nd generation of titanium knives. The original series launched in 2015 and received a lot of positive customer recommendations, but the design had a lot of room for improvements.We are proud to launch this 2nd generation here on Kickstarter and share these unique knives with our backers.All these Prototype Titanium knives feature a full tang design. Meaning that the steel core reaches from the knives Point to the knives Butt. The steel core is made of a high wear resistant Carbon Stainless Steel (Type 5Cr15MoV) and the blade is coated with a 0.1 micrometer layer of titanium.This thin layer of titanium bonds with the steel core increasing the blades overall strength. The hardness of the blade without the titanium coating is 58 Rockwell, with the added titanium layer and bonding the blade reaches 61±2 Rockwell.
Unpolished old series blade on the left, new series blade on the rightCompared to the old series blade, which had only a hardness of 55 Rockwell at best, the blades of the new Titanium Series are not only thinner but also feature a reduced height. Both leading to a weight reduction of up to 12% in the case of the chef's knife version.
Unpolished old series blade on the left, new series blade on the rightAfter the coating process, the blade is mirror polished by hand using a new nano-particle buffing technique. This buffing technique improves the blades resilience against sticky clippings, leading to a lotus effect on the blades surface. Therefore giving the knives their unique look while enhancing their cutting and slicing ability with greatly reduced friction.Titanium knife getting its Solinger DünnschliffIn contrast to the old series, which were mechanically sharpened, the new blade is hand-sharpened with the unique Solinger Dünnschliff, which is a traditional diamond sanding technique unique to the German city of Solingen. 
Development sketch of the new handle with new rivet orientation,whereas Letter E in Diagram stands for Ergonomie AngleThe Titanium knives come with a new special ergonomic handle designed for every hand shape or size. It's slightly angled inwards to your palm, providing a strong grip for any cuttings and improved grip in case the handle gets soaked.
Old series fine wood handle on the left, new series handle on the rightThe scales are now made of an anti-bacterial composite called Micarta, instead of fine wood, which features a nice wooden finish. The scales are joined with the tang using newly oriented 3 rivets.

Due to its very light weight and eye-catching design this knife is also perfect for heavy duty work like cutting thicker vegetables and meat. Technical details:

Santoku blade geometry incorporates the sheep's foot tip. A sheep's foot design essentially draws the spine (""backstrap"") down to the front, with very little clearance above the horizontal cutting plane when the blade is resting naturally from heel to forward cutting edge. Providing a more linear cutting edge, the Santoku has limited ""rocking"" travel (in comparison to a German/Western-style chef's knife). The Santoku may be used in a rocking motion; however, very little cutting edge makes contact with the surface due to the extreme radius of the tip and very little ""tip travel"" occurs due to the short cantilever span from contact landing to tip. An example of this limitation can be demonstrated in dicing an onion—a Western knife generally slices downward and then rocks the tip forward to complete a cut; the Santoku relies more on a single downward cut and even landing from heel to tip, thus using less of a rocking motion than Western-style cutlery.  Technical details:

This knife features the same design as the Titanium Santoku Knife but adds another unique feature: a hollow edge. The unique characteristic of a hollow edge is several small cavities that get hammered into the blade in close proximity to each other. The purpose of these cavities is to prevent the adherence of particularly thin, greasy or otherwise sticky clippings, such as ham or cheese, on the knife and thus also to cut very thin slices without damage. This property is due to the reduction of the blade surface which comes into contact with the cut material. In the case of pure cheese knives, there are even holes in the blade instead of the cavities, which achieve the same effect. However, since the soft or very thin material can be entangled in the holes, holes are not universally applicable. Cavities, on the other hand, are a good compromise between reducing the surface of the blade and stabilizing the cut material. 
Sketch with old angle on the left, new angle on the rightBased on the 1st generation our engineers improved the design of the hollow edges angle, which increases the cavities effect. The new cavities and edge angle dramatically improved the blades resilience against sticky clippings.In our 2nd generation, blades cutting curves has been decreased, which results in more sliding effect through the cuts. (Please see markings, inch sketch RIGHT )Technical details:

<h3><b>Indirect Light To Create The Perfect Mood</b></h3>
<p>Direct light can sometimes be too bright or create unpleasant glare. Indirect lighting via the ceiling can create a very pleasant light ambience. However, currently available solutions can be very expensive and difficult to install. Our lamp is the first where you can easily upgrade any room to get indirect light with just one lamp! You can even choose multiple colors for the indirect light, to create the perfect mood for any situation and you don’t need additional colored mood lights anymore.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1452381091/txwb1fk7vhnoz6ynqurt.png"" src=""""/></p>
</div><h3>""Paint Your Light"" For Intuitive Adjustment</h3><div>
<p>The adjustment of the light is very easy with the free companion app. Just pick a color and paint the light in the desired direction. The more you paint, the brighter it gets, while the other parts of your room will stay dimmed. To give you a real-time feedback, the lamp will light-up immediately while you paint.</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">We use so-called “light scenes” to store your favorite light settings. You can store any setting as a light scene and come back to it with just one swipe in the app. The app also allows you to control several of our lamps and switch between them easily.</span></p>

<p>We believe that smart lighting products must be visually appealing and built with high quality materials. This is why we put a lot of effort into the design. The heat sink is made from anodized Aluminium and the powerful LEDs are covered behind a durable anti-glare diffuser. The lamp is designed and manufactured in Europe. The design already won the Silver Award at the 2015 London Design Award.</p>

<p>The lamp uses LED technology and has up to 4200 lumen output when fully illuminated. This is about as much light as a 300W incandescent bulb provides.</p>
</div><div>
<p>We use high-quality white LEDs that provide adjustable warm to cool light with one of the highest color-rendering index (CRI) on the market. In addition, it’s uplight has red, green, and blue LEDs to provide a full color mood light to the ceiling. The LEDs have a lifetime of up to 60.000 hours at full power, so that it will easily last over 10 years.</p>
<p>Installing the lamp is easy. It comes with a specially designed ceiling mount to fit it to any kind of flat ceiling surface. It has an universal power supply, so that it can be directly connected to any outlet on the ceiling.</p>

<h3>Smart Home Functionality</h3>
</div><h4>Smart Learning</h4><div>
<p>The lamp learns from your behavior by analyzing which light scenes you use during the course of a day. This helps it to predict the most likely light scene whenever it is turned on (automatically or using the light switch). For example, when you are going to the bathroom during the night, it will turn on the appropriate “dimmed” light scene to illuminate your way without blinding, or, when you watch TV most days at 8pm, it turns on your favorite TV light scene when you enter the room. If you are not satisfied with the lamp's suggested light scene, you simply swipe to the desired scene, which will improve the next prediction. You can, of course, turn this feature off, if you would like to use it in places where it is not desired.</p>
<h4>Presence Detection</h4>
</div><div>
<p>The lamp uses presence detection sensors to turn itself on when you enter the room in the dark. Whenever you leave the room, it turns itself off to save energy and protect the environment.</p>
<h4>Click Detection</h4>
</div><div>
<p>When you don’t have your phone with you but want to change to another light scene, you can do so by simply turning the light switch off and on again. The lamp recognizes this “click” and switches to the next light scene.</p>
<h4>System Integration</h4>
</div><div>The lamp is truly smart by itself and does not require additional devices such as hubs or switches. Nevertheless, we want it to be able to communicate with other smart home products and are therefore working on integrating it into 3rd party smart home systems. Our initial set of systems that the lamp will be able to communicate with “out of the box” is: <a href=""https://www.athom.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Homey</a>, <a href=""http://guh.io"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Guh.IO</a> and <a href=""http://www.openhab.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">openHAB</a>. Several others are already planned and will be announced in the upcoming months.</div><div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1452382396/p5udqvbr9efnzjakyb4m.png"" src=""""/></p></div><h4>Whats's Next</h4><div>
<p>This is all just the beginning! We have carefully engineered the lamp to include all relevant sensors and a future-proof bluetooth wireless module, so that we can add new features through our regular software updates. We have many great ideas on our roadmap and are eager to bring them in your hands as soon as possible!</p>

<h3>What Makes The Lamp Unique?</h3>
</div><div><p>Our lamp is much more than just another smart lamp. We have put thousands of hours of engineering into the development to make it the ultimate smart lamp.

<div>We offer the lamp with cable lengths between 1 and 4 meters (3.3 to 13.2 ft). The preferred cable length will be collected after the end of the campaign in the fulfillment survey. Furthermore, the ceiling mount will allow to wind-up and hide up to 1m (3.3 ft) of cable. So if you select, e.g. a 2 m cable, you can adjust the height between 1 and 2 meter from the ceiling. The minimal recommended distance from the ceiling is 20 cm (0.7 ft).</div>

Place The Light Where You Need It
An award winning design pendant lamp that allows you to move the light in any direction using simple paint gestures on your phone!
Instead of dimming the light in your room, you can adjust the direction of your light to place it where you need it. This allows to create any light setting with just one pendant lamp!
 

 
Indirect Light To Create The Perfect Mood
Direct light can sometimes be too bright or create unpleasant glare. Indirect lighting via the ceiling can create a very pleasant light ambience. However, currently available solutions can be very expensive and difficult to install. Our lamp is the first where you can easily upgrade any room to get indirect light with just one lamp! You can even choose multiple colors for the indirect light, to create the perfect mood for any situation and you don’t need additional colored mood lights anymore.

""Paint Your Light"" For Intuitive Adjustment
The adjustment of the light is very easy with the free companion app. Just pick a color and paint the light in the desired direction. The more you paint, the brighter it gets, while the other parts of your room will stay dimmed. To give you a real-time feedback, the lamp will light-up immediately while you paint.
We use so-called “light scenes” to store your favorite light settings. You can store any setting as a light scene and come back to it with just one swipe in the app. The app also allows you to control several of our lamps and switch between them easily.


 
 

We believe that smart lighting products must be visually appealing and built with high quality materials. This is why we put a lot of effort into the design. The heat sink is made from anodized Aluminium and the powerful LEDs are covered behind a durable anti-glare diffuser. The lamp is designed and manufactured in Europe. The design already won the Silver Award at the 2015 London Design Award.
 



 

The lamp uses LED technology and has up to 4200 lumen output when fully illuminated. This is about as much light as a 300W incandescent bulb provides.

We use high-quality white LEDs that provide adjustable warm to cool light with one of the highest color-rendering index (CRI) on the market. In addition, it’s uplight has red, green, and blue LEDs to provide a full color mood light to the ceiling. The LEDs have a lifetime of up to 60.000 hours at full power, so that it will easily last over 10 years.
Installing the lamp is easy. It comes with a specially designed ceiling mount to fit it to any kind of flat ceiling surface. It has an universal power supply, so that it can be directly connected to any outlet on the ceiling.

 
Smart Home Functionality
Smart Learning
The lamp learns from your behavior by analyzing which light scenes you use during the course of a day. This helps it to predict the most likely light scene whenever it is turned on (automatically or using the light switch). For example, when you are going to the bathroom during the night, it will turn on the appropriate “dimmed” light scene to illuminate your way without blinding, or, when you watch TV most days at 8pm, it turns on your favorite TV light scene when you enter the room. If you are not satisfied with the lamp's suggested light scene, you simply swipe to the desired scene, which will improve the next prediction. You can, of course, turn this feature off, if you would like to use it in places where it is not desired.
Presence Detection

The lamp uses presence detection sensors to turn itself on when you enter the room in the dark. Whenever you leave the room, it turns itself off to save energy and protect the environment.
Click Detection

When you don’t have your phone with you but want to change to another light scene, you can do so by simply turning the light switch off and on again. The lamp recognizes this “click” and switches to the next light scene.
System Integration
The lamp is truly smart by itself and does not require additional devices such as hubs or switches. Nevertheless, we want it to be able to communicate with other smart home products and are therefore working on integrating it into 3rd party smart home systems. Our initial set of systems that the lamp will be able to communicate with “out of the box” is: Homey, Guh.IO and openHAB. Several others are already planned and will be announced in the upcoming months.Whats's Next
This is all just the beginning! We have carefully engineered the lamp to include all relevant sensors and a future-proof bluetooth wireless module, so that we can add new features through our regular software updates. We have many great ideas on our roadmap and are eager to bring them in your hands as soon as possible!
 
What Makes The Lamp Unique?
Our lamp is much more than just another smart lamp. We have put thousands of hours of engineering into the development to make it the ultimate smart lamp. Specially designed electronics control over 300 white and colored LEDs individually and several sensors interact with the environment. Our patent-pending optics realize the directional lighting effect without any moving parts in the lamp. The carefully crafted heat sink is integral part of the overall product design, keeping the LEDs cool and ensuring a long lifetime.


Some Of Our Prototypes
We have spent the past year designing, prototyping, coding, testing and iterating to develop our lamp. With each iteration we were able to improve the design as well as the technology.

Incandescent ? Smart Bulb ? Smart Lamp
Due to the ban on incandescents, most light bulb manufacturers started developing smart LED bulbs. At Luke Roberts, we think that these bulbs are only a transitional technology that will vanish soon and that LED lamps, such as ours, are the future of smart lighting.
Smart Bulbs:

 

Smart bulbs require additional fixtures for each bulb
Light output of a single smart bulb is rather low
One smart bulb can only produce one color and brightness at a time
Smartness and advanced features require a hub and Internet connection

Smart Lamp:
 

Full LED fixture - not just a bulb
About as bright as 4 smart bulbs to illuminate even larger rooms
Independently controllable up- and downlight gives you unprecedented flexibility
Allows you to place the light in different directions
Heat sink is big enough to keep LEDs cool and ensure long lifetime
Smartness is in the lamp, it does not require a hub nor internet connection

<p>Revolutionary design for maximum air exposure to UV-C light. The longer the air is exposed to UV-C light, the more cleaning power. That’s why our engineers created a vertical chamber to slow down the air and increase dosage time. The result? An industry leading 75% product height to UV-C light ratio while in the chamber.</p>

Recent UVC break-throughs in manufacturing have made it possible for high quality UVC bulbs to enter the consumer market. Clean-tech's 2-Stage air purification rethinks the fundamentals by focusing on maximum UVC exposure time rather than just collecting pollution and maximizing air volume. <br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1609198130/mrggzzv2tfvciorr2pfh.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Stage 1</strong></p>
<p>Full room air purification begins with a HEPA 10 air filter removing larger particles and allergens to optimize the UVC effectiveness. Large particles will block the UVC light rays from deactivating microorganisms. This first stage is critical to cycling and purifying air at scale.</p>
<p><strong>Stage 2</strong></p>
<p>Air flows into the purifying chamber coated with ReflectTech mirror coating the optimal 360 degree equidistance from the bulb for a amplified UVC dosage at extremely high intensity. The mirror coating both reduces particles from adhering to the side of the chamber, but bounces and focuses the UVC 254μm wave length into the chamber. All air flowing through the device is sterilized.</p>

Revolutionary design for maximum air exposure to UV-C light. The longer the air is exposed to UV-C light, the more cleaning power. That’s why our engineers created a vertical chamber to slow down the air and increase dosage time. The result? An industry leading 75% product height to UV-C light ratio while in the chamber.
 

Clean-tech uses an ultra powerful and high efficiency 254 nm UVC wavelength bulb that provides the right intensity, dose and duration that's needed to inactivate and destroy the outer proteins of microorganisms. (see FDA article here). 

Filters that collect or trap particles and dust rather than destroying them. Airborne particles are much smaller than droplets and can linger in the air for longer. Air currents can also carry them longer distances.  


Invisible to the eye, there are harmful particles suspended in the air. These airborne particles cannot be removed with hand sanitizers and masks.  

 

Access the 9/16/2020 Lab Result 1
Access the 9/16/2020 Lab Result 2 HEPA and UVC light technology has been a trusted technology for air purification from hospitals to airports for decades. Recent UVC break-throughs in manufacturing have made it possible for high quality UVC bulbs to enter the consumer market. Clean-tech's 2-Stage air purification rethinks the fundamentals by focusing on maximum UVC exposure time rather than just collecting pollution and maximizing air volume. 
 
Stage 1
Full room air purification begins with a HEPA 10 air filter removing larger particles and allergens to optimize the UVC effectiveness. Large particles will block the UVC light rays from deactivating microorganisms. This first stage is critical to cycling and purifying air at scale.
Stage 2
Air flows into the purifying chamber coated with ReflectTech mirror coating the optimal 360 degree equidistance from the bulb for a amplified UVC dosage at extremely high intensity. The mirror coating both reduces particles from adhering to the side of the chamber, but bounces and focuses the UVC 254μm wave length into the chamber. All air flowing through the device is sterilized.

 
UV LIGHT IS A PROVEN TECHNOLOGY USED IN HOSPITALS FOR YEARS
It’s used on Airplanes, Bus Terminals, and other Public Spaces. It cleans better than chemicals without damaging fabrics. The FDA (link to article) confirms that UV-C light at 254 nm is a trusted technology that is effective at inactivating microorganisms.


 






Our unique ReflectTech mirror coating when applied to stainless steel increases the reflectiveness by 30%. This means that the UV-C light is magnified inside of the sterilizing chamber.  The widened chamber slows down the air flow while exposing particles to maximum UV dosage. The coating also prevents particles from attaching to the sides of the chamber.

UVC light has been a proven cleaning technology trusted by hospitals, airports, bus terminals, and other public spaces. In fact, it cleans better than chemicals that damage fabrics. Safely sanitize the air around you with medical grade ultraviolet light that destroys microorganisms at the molecular level.

The ultraviolet rays destroy the molecular structure of DNA or RNA in the cells of microorganisms. 


Within the ultraviolet light, wavelengths known as UV-C, from 200 to 280 nanometers (nm) have been shown to be the most effective for disinfection. Reference: ies.org

<p>Petit Qoobo is a new sibling of Qoobo, Yukai Engineering's popular robotic pillow that wags its tail in response to one's touch. Petit Qoobo, which is one size smaller than Qoobo, reacts not only to the user's stroking but also to the surrounding natural soundscape – be it the sound of clapping or one’s voice. In addition, when you are cuddling Petit Qoobo, you'll be able to hear its ""heartbeat.""  We hope that this little one, reminiscent of skittish, young animals, will provide you with comfort and enrich your life. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1590652580/vdnbqbgsrkgrisvu6o6d.jpg"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://static.camp-fire.jp/uploads/editor_uploaded_image/image/558407/Petit_06Office.gif"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://static.camp-fire.jp/uploads/editor_uploaded_image/image/558190/Petit_08knee.gif"" src=""""/> </p>
<p>Qoobo was inspired by a Yukai designer’s wish for a healing presence at home that could comfort her at the end of a long day. When she proposed to create a pet-like robot during the company's internal makeathon camp in March 2017, we immediately decided to make it a reality by focusing on the animal's tail. This is how the Qoobo project began.</p>
<p>We paid particular attention to Qoobo's weight, size and texture, so it would feel comfortable and natural when you put it on your lap and cuddle it in your arms. We researched actual tails and developed a mechanism that reproduces lifelike movements. A year after the product's general market release in November 2018, Qoobo had already exceeded cumulative sales of 15,000 units, including the presale, in Japan and internationally. </p>

<p>Then in July 2019, we launched the Petit Qoobo project in response to a fan's feedback that they wished to have a smaller, portable version of Qoobo that they could carry around wherever they go.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Wags its tail in response to one's touch</strong></li></ul>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>A design that leaves a “blank space” for the imagination​</strong></p>
<p>In designing Qoobo, we removed all of an animal's physical elements but the tail to leave room for users to freely imagine their Qoobo's appearances and personalities.</p>
<p>In the user's mind, Qoobo could be a “dog,” a “cat,” or even a “rabbit.”</p>
<p>When creating Petit Qoobo, we focused on designing the short tail reminiscent of those of young, skittish animals. There are four color variations: Gris (gray), Marron (brown), Noir (black), and Blanc (white).</p>

<p>We created Qoobo as a robot that you want to actively play and have fun with. But, we realize you don't always have to consciously try to interact with your pets – or robots, for that matter.</p>
<p>You don't need to be looking at your pets directly to feel their presence. You may feel their heartbeat when holding them. Or, you may feel a connection with your pet when it reacts to a sound or voice that you also hear. We want Petit Qoobo to be that unassuming and comforting presence – a robot that's always with you, both physically and emotionally. This is why we decided to give Petit Qoobo its heartbeat and the ability to respond to sounds and voices.</p>
<p>It's our hope that Petit Qoobo will be the robot you develop a bond with and want to keep by your side, whether at home or on the road.</p>

Petit Qoobo, which is one size smaller than Qoobo, reacts not only to the user's stroking but also to the surrounding natural soundscape – be it the sound of clapping or one’s voice. In addition, when you are cuddling Petit Qoobo, you'll be able to hear its ""heartbeat.""  We hope that this little one, reminiscent of skittish, young animals, will provide you with comfort and enrich your life. 
  
Qoobo was inspired by a Yukai designer’s wish for a healing presence at home that could comfort her at the end of a long day. When she proposed to create a pet-like robot during the company's internal makeathon camp in March 2017, we immediately decided to make it a reality by focusing on the animal's tail. This is how the Qoobo project began.
We paid particular attention to Qoobo's weight, size and texture, so it would feel comfortable and natural when you put it on your lap and cuddle it in your arms. We researched actual tails and developed a mechanism that reproduces lifelike movements. A year after the product's general market release in November 2018, Qoobo had already exceeded cumulative sales of 15,000 units, including the presale, in Japan and internationally. 

Then in July 2019, we launched the Petit Qoobo project in response to a fan's feedback that they wished to have a smaller, portable version of Qoobo that they could carry around wherever they go.

 

Wags its tail in response to one's touch
When caressed, it waves gently. When rubbed, it swings playfully. It occasionally wags just to say hello. Users can interpret Qoobo's varying responses however they like, and enjoy ""heart-to-heart"" communication with their robot.

We researched real tails and built a program which reproduces lifelike movementsFor Petit Qoobo, we redesigned the mechanism to create tail movements that mimic those of small animals.
 
A portable size
We made Petit Qoobo small enough for you to keep it with you wherever you go. It fits perfectly in your bag or basket. You can even take it to the office!

 
Tail that reacts to sounds or voices
Petit Qoobo can get startled by loud sounds, or may wiggle its tail when it hears your voice.

Petit Qoobo's internal circuitry and programming are designed to produce varying tail movements based on the volume of sounds or voices.
 
A subtle heartbeat
You can feel Petit Qoobo’s subtle heartbeat. Cuddle it, put it on your lap, or by your bedside. You can feel the presence – or subtle vibrations – of Petit Qoobo, even if you are not looking directly at it.

Fine controlled actuator to replicate a heartbeat
 

A design that leaves a “blank space” for the imagination​
In designing Qoobo, we removed all of an animal's physical elements but the tail to leave room for users to freely imagine their Qoobo's appearances and personalities.
In the user's mind, Qoobo could be a “dog,” a “cat,” or even a “rabbit.”
When creating Petit Qoobo, we focused on designing the short tail reminiscent of those of young, skittish animals. There are four color variations: Gris (gray), Marron (brown), Noir (black), and Blanc (white).

 

“You can be together with Petit Qoobo all the time.　We want it to be a presence that feels closer both mentally and physically.”

We created Qoobo as a robot that you want to actively play and have fun with. But, we realize you don't always have to consciously try to interact with your pets – or robots, for that matter.
You don't need to be looking at your pets directly to feel their presence. You may feel their heartbeat when holding them. Or, you may feel a connection with your pet when it reacts to a sound or voice that you also hear. We want Petit Qoobo to be that unassuming and comforting presence – a robot that's always with you, both physically and emotionally. This is why we decided to give Petit Qoobo its heartbeat and the ability to respond to sounds and voices.
It's our hope that Petit Qoobo will be the robot you develop a bond with and want to keep by your side, whether at home or on the road.

We first jotted down many different ideas on sticky notes, describing various tail movements. 
They included the spinning of the tail – as if Petit Qoobo felt dizzy – in reaction to the user spinning Petit Qoobo around. 
We carefully whittled down these multiple ideas before deciding on a select few.
 

Mechanical prototypes of Petit Qoobo.We went through trial and error to create a lifelike tail mechanism that moves expressively.
 

We experimented with different actuator designs for the ""heartbeat.""
We tagged each actuator with a number before checking them for movement inconsistencies and noise levels.
 

In the early stages of development, the tail was a little longer than it is now.
 

We sewed fur covers in various colors and compared the shades.
 

There was a time when we sewed a cover and realized the fur was flowing in the wrong direction...
 

We also considered putting together the body and tail in different colors.
 

Sometimes, we enjoyed sweets together.

<p>We are happy to send out so many towels to the world (32 countries to be exact ...and counting) and change the way people shower! For many who never tried <strong>K-25</strong> before, the problem stays yet the same:</p>
<ul>
<li>Perpetually wet towels that take forever to dry, and develop moldy stinky smells, even after wash. </li>
<li>Towels that become so wet and heavy you feel uncomfortable to wrap around your body. </li>
<li>Poor quality scratchy towels that irritate your skin...</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Who can relate? What can you do about it? </strong></p>
<p>You may do laundry every day - using tons of energy &amp; water. On top of losing time &amp; money, that's not eco-friendly, right?... AND You will end up buying new towels every month in. </p>
<p>Disappointing conventional towels on the market inspired us to invent a unique towel technology - <strong>K-25.</strong></p>

<p><strong>K-25 towels</strong> solve the biggest consumer pain. We applied scientific approach to tackle the problem. It was a long creative process with three variables in hand: fabric weight, pattern and weaving technique. After developing many prototype samples we achieved a perfect balance - our Patent pending SECRET SAUCE.</p>

</div></div>","We are happy to send out so many towels to the world (32 countries to be exact ...and counting) and change the way people shower! For many who never tried K-25 before, the problem stays yet the same:

Perpetually wet towels that take forever to dry, and develop moldy stinky smells, even after wash. 
Towels that become so wet and heavy you feel uncomfortable to wrap around your body. 
Poor quality scratchy towels that irritate your skin...

Who can relate? What can you do about it? 
You may do laundry every day - using tons of energy & water. On top of losing time & money, that's not eco-friendly, right?... AND You will end up buying new towels every month in. 
Disappointing conventional towels on the market inspired us to invent a unique towel technology - K-25.

K-25 towels solve the biggest consumer pain. We applied scientific approach to tackle the problem. It was a long creative process with three variables in hand: fabric weight, pattern and weaving technique. After developing many prototype samples we achieved a perfect balance - our Patent pending SECRET SAUCE.






+ do some math how much you save on laundry and new towels...

 


The combination of ALL-in-1 features creates a towel perfect to follow you on any activity such as gym, spa, trails, travel, pool, beach.






 


 


 


 

Believe it or not, but textile is one of the World leaders in ocean pollution. When you support K-25 Smart Bath Towels we will donate to our charity partner focused on saving whales and dolphins.",31.0,0,"5 Campaigns

It even worked wonders with pet hair. We're ready to provide you with the solution to make clogged drains a thing of the past in your household. Pet Owners RejoiceThe ShowerShroom works great with dog and cat hair alike. Bathing a shedding furry friend can yield a ton of hair, but ShowerShroom handles it with ease. Yes, really! We're pet owners ourselves and we know how quickly drains can clog when you've got animals that shed whenever you bathe them. Keep your pets clean and your drains clear... for good.Designed to WorkDuring the entire design process, our #1 focus was on making sure that the ShowerShroom did its job extremely well. We never want to settle for just ""alright"" performance on any design. It has to do what our customers expect it to do and it has to do it in a simple and intuitive way. Every decision made on design was made with that overriding purpose in mind. Take a closer look for yourself. Easy to UseOur patent-pending ShowerShroom is designed to not only do its job flawlessly, it's also made to work with as little effort on your part as possible. The last thing we want is for our backers to have to bend over backwards to get it working or to have to clean it on a daily basis. With ShowerShroom, you set it and forget it for quite some time depending on how much long hair you or your fellow shower-takers shed at a time. Some testers have gone months without having to clean the ShowerShroom!       The Perfect GiftJust like we've done in the past, we make sure you receive beautifully-packaged finished products that you can give to a special someone whose life you'd like to make just a little easier. Whether it's for Mother's Day, Father's Day, or a special birthday, the ShowerShroom (or any of our products!) makes for a unique and problem-solving gift that your loved ones will appreciate. ShowerShroom will be available in three colors: Clean White, Neutral Gray, and Marina Blue.TubShroom® for Your Bath TubDon't stop at your shower drain... our very first wildly successful product is called TubShroom and it was designed to protect your standard-sized bath tub drain from clogging. It catches your hair neatly out of sight without blocking the flow of water. TubShroom is currently available to bundle with your pledge in six fabulous colors: Clean White, Neutral Gray, Marina Blue, Organic Green, Autumn Orange, and Titan Clear.        SinkShroom™ For Bathroom Sink DrainsFor those of you who brush your hair over the sink drain, you know just how quickly these often-used drains can start slowing down.

<br/>A vacuum attachment that cleans everything.</h1>
<p>Dirt is to be found everywhere, so naturally also on delicate objects or in areas that are difficult, if not impossible to clean.</p>
<p>We also had that problem. So we began to think of ways to solve it! How can one construct a vacuum cleaner attachment that has the advantage of combining several methods of cleaning?</p>
<p><b>And then we had the idea: “What is not possible to do alone will be possible to do by many together.”</b></p>

<h1> Our Story</h1>
<p>The <b>Dusty-Brush Team</b> is a young start-up with its place of business in Kreuzlingen, Switzerland. We are united with our enjoyment of <b>technology, innovation</b> and everything concerning our daily lives. We had the idea of <b>Dusty-Brush</b> in <b>June 2015</b>, and have been working on it since then, to make our vision a reality.</p>

<p>We have been involved with the evolution of development for many years. We work with machines that create a lot of dust. Our toolboxes and general objects were always getting dirty, and could only be cleaned with a lot of effort. In the search for a solution for a way to speed up this annoying work, we came up with the idea of Dusty-Brush. As with an ant colony, it takes working together to get the job done well. We transferred the idea to Dusty-Brush. “Many manage more than one” , was followed by considerations and drawings.</p>
<div data-id=""14006001""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1477426423/ohc7h6cgcqdmimuimtcw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></figure></div>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The results were surprisingly good. And suddenly we discovered the hidden potential in Dusty-Brush. We involved our neighbors, friends and relatives as testers, and received very positive feedback. Encouraged by the feedback, we then went on the search for a manufacturer. That the manufacturing process is not as easy as one would think, in looking back, we found this work to be very time consuming. We eventually had success and found an absolutely dependable and professional production location we could now use.</p>
<p><b>Dusty-Brush is 100% Made in Germany.</b></p>
<p>Dusty-Brush is <b>100%</b> completely <b>developed</b> and <b>tested</b>. All of the production processes and chains of delivery have been organized and are waiting to be set into action.</p>
<h1>Why you should become a part of Dusty-Brush</h1>
<p>We want to show Dusty-Brush to the world. We want opinions and suggestions, especially from you Indiegogos. Everyone can find a use for Dusty-Brush.The potential is almost infinitely large. With your support we can bring our project to life, and really make a difference in our cleaning efforts.

<h1> How it works</h1>
<p>“The brush that vacuums” was our idea.</p>
<p>From this idea grew a simple and genial principle.</p>
<p>The main thought behind this invention is, that instead of a <b>single large </b>opening there would be <b>many small</b> suction areas through many tubes. Through these the suction would be optimally distributed. <b>Very small, fine areas could be cleaned and small parts and objects would not get lost.</b></p>
<div data-id=""14006199""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1477426434/qhvsek4axnexyrb6rn0e.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></figure></div>

<p>Dusty-Brush is based on the principle of <b>a brush. With a brush,</b> you can clean almost <b>any area.</b> It fits onto all uneven surfaces and can be used anywhere.</p>
<p>The only <b>disadvantage is</b>, a <b>brush cannot vacuum up dust.</b></p>
<div data-id=""14006214""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1477426436/n4fco3aboxi96nrpxzkb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></figure></div>

<p>It is important to us that with the<b> number of the tubes, using a standard vacuum cleaner</b>, the <b>air flow remains the same</b>. That creates the advantage that the vacuum cleaner is not unnecessarily <b>overburdened</b>. At the same time, the power of the vacuum cleaner is distributed evenly.</p>

<p><br/>First, the <b>high number</b> of <b>tubes</b> makes everything possible. Just like a brush, they attach themselves to every <b>uneven surface</b>.They can also vacuum the dirt out of the <b>smallest grooves</b>, <b>cracks and hidden edges.</b></p>

<h1>Optional</h1>
<p>Adapters can be added to as needed. Because just one size is not needed for every area, we can offer three different diameters for the tubes.</p>
<p>These are:</p>
<ul><li>1,8 mm - this is for very fine and delicate objects. Because of the small tube diameters, it has more tubes. The suction is very evenly distributed with this adapter.</li></ul>
<ul><li>2,3 mm - This is the all-rounder. The suction is somewhat stronger and is distributed among fewer tubes. This is good for <b>standard dirty areas.</b>
</li></ul>
<ul><li>2,8 mm - This is the strongest. It has a very strong suction and is especially meant to be used for very dirty areas. It is ideal for <b>cars and workshops.</b>
</li></ul>

<p> </p>
<p>So that you do not have to buy three completely different adapters, these are separable. That way, you can exchange to whatever adapter is needed for the different situations and areas of dirt.</p>
<p>It is also possible for us to offer adapters for different vacuum cleaners like Dyson and Vorwerk, without having to create a completely new nozzle.</p>

</div></div>","A vacuum attachment that cleans everything.
Dirt is to be found everywhere, so naturally also on delicate objects or in areas that are difficult, if not impossible to clean.
We also had that problem. So we began to think of ways to solve it! How can one construct a vacuum cleaner attachment that has the advantage of combining several methods of cleaning?
And then we had the idea: “What is not possible to do alone will be possible to do by many together.”

 Our Story
The Dusty-Brush Team is a young start-up with its place of business in Kreuzlingen, Switzerland. We are united with our enjoyment of technology, innovation and everything concerning our daily lives. We had the idea of Dusty-Brush in June 2015, and have been working on it since then, to make our vision a reality.

 

 

We have been involved with the evolution of development for many years. We work with machines that create a lot of dust. Our toolboxes and general objects were always getting dirty, and could only be cleaned with a lot of effort. In the search for a solution for a way to speed up this annoying work, we came up with the idea of Dusty-Brush. As with an ant colony, it takes working together to get the job done well. We transferred the idea to Dusty-Brush. “Many manage more than one” , was followed by considerations and drawings.

 
We developed our first prototypes………

……and began.

 
 
The results were surprisingly good. And suddenly we discovered the hidden potential in Dusty-Brush. We involved our neighbors, friends and relatives as testers, and received very positive feedback. Encouraged by the feedback, we then went on the search for a manufacturer. That the manufacturing process is not as easy as one would think, in looking back, we found this work to be very time consuming. We eventually had success and found an absolutely dependable and professional production location we could now use.
Dusty-Brush is 100% Made in Germany.
Dusty-Brush is 100% completely developed and tested. All of the production processes and chains of delivery have been organized and are waiting to be set into action.
Why you should become a part of Dusty-Brush
We want to show Dusty-Brush to the world. We want opinions and suggestions, especially from you Indiegogos. Everyone can find a use for Dusty-Brush.The potential is almost infinitely large. With your support we can bring our project to life, and really make a difference in our cleaning efforts. Become a part of Dusty-Brush and help a father and his son to enable their vision of the future to become true.
Bring Dusty Brush to life!

Cleans delicate objects effortlessly 

Is very sturdy. Can be deployed universally Lessens dust pollution in the home
Is antistatic



The standard cleaning products available today often have many limits and are not universally suitable to be used in many areas.

 

Areas of application
Dusty-Brush makes it possible for you to clean areas that were unthinkable before, from delicate objects to hard-to-reach corners, edges and grooves. Each one of us has his own special problem areas.
Convince yourself!

 

 

 

 

 How it works
“The brush that vacuums” was our idea.
From this idea grew a simple and genial principle.
The main thought behind this invention is, that instead of a single large opening there would be many small suction areas through many tubes. Through these the suction would be optimally distributed. Very small, fine areas could be cleaned and small parts and objects would not get lost.

 

Dusty-Brush is based on the principle of a brush. With a brush, you can clean almost any area. It fits onto all uneven surfaces and can be used anywhere.
The only disadvantage is, a brush cannot vacuum up dust.

 

 

 

 
It is important to us that with the number of the tubes, using a standard vacuum cleaner, the air flow remains the same. That creates the advantage that the vacuum cleaner is not unnecessarily overburdened. At the same time, the power of the vacuum cleaner is distributed evenly.

What creates the difference

First, the high number of tubes makes everything possible. Just like a brush, they attach themselves to every uneven surface.They can also vacuum the dirt out of the smallest grooves, cracks and hidden edges.
 

 

 

 

 

 Heavy-duty
Thanks to the special high-molecular weight thermoplastic polymer, it is possible to use much pressure. Dusty-Brush will not break and returns back to its original position. You can use it to get to the hard-to-reach places.

 

 

 

Universal
Our integrated adapter makes it possible to fit onto the current vacuum cleaner tubes.

 

Optional
Adapters can be added to as needed. Because just one size is not needed for every area, we can offer three different diameters for the tubes.
These are:
1,8 mm - this is for very fine and delicate objects. Because of the small tube diameters, it has more tubes. The suction is very evenly distributed with this adapter.
2,3 mm - This is the all-rounder. The suction is somewhat stronger and is distributed among fewer tubes. This is good for standard dirty areas.

2,8 mm - This is the strongest. It has a very strong suction and is especially meant to be used for very dirty areas. It is ideal for cars and workshops.


 
So that you do not have to buy three completely different adapters, these are separable. That way, you can exchange to whatever adapter is needed for the different situations and areas of dirt.
It is also possible for us to offer adapters for different vacuum cleaners like Dyson and Vorwerk, without having to create a completely new nozzle.

 

 

 Dyson - Adapter

 

 

Antistatic
Our plastic does not create static electricity; therefore sensitive electronic devices are also protected. But because there is always a slight risk, we offer Dusty-Brush with an extra feature in the form of a grounding cable, when attached, to discharge this electricity. The electricity charge will be safely diverted and the electric machines will be kept safe.

 

 

 

 Cleaning

A non-stick coating prevents it from clogging. In case the tube does get clogged, you can clean it with a thin rod or stick. As an alternative, Dusty-Brush can also be rinsed out under running hot water. A cleaning rod is included in every package.

Ergonomic 
A comfortable position as well as an optimal coverage is guarantied through an angle of a minimum of 45 degrees.

The tapered end has the advantage that, just as with a feather duster or dusting product, one can also vacuum on smooth surfaces.

 

 For our best friends
There is enough suction when used in the hair growing direction to remove the dead skin cells without the Dusty-Brush attaching itself to the skin.
The tubes remove loose hair from your dog or cat, before they get distributed into the room. The hair just gets sucked into the vacuum cleaner instead.

It’s really great!

 

Dusty-Brush is also perfect for allergic and asthma sufferers. Combined with a vacuum made especially for the removal of fine dust, the fine dust pollution is greatly reduced. The dust is directly sucked into the vacuum without being stirred up, which has a positive effect in a hygienic household.

Disappointed with the battery performance? Angered about not getting clear images all the time? Annoyed with the setup that could take forever? Tired of the expensive subscription fee? Finally, here comes a video doorbell you can trust -- 360 Video Doorbell X3.        Featuring four detection technologies, 360 X3 only reports you what matters. Radar sensor offers ultra-precise detection to pick up movement and track object trajectory, to avoid false alarms from traffic or pedestrians. This is complemented by a suite of passive infrared sensors, human detection, and facial recognition technologies to allow extremely accurate and fast readings while maintaining optimum battery life. And the 360 X3 let you customize the detection zone, so you can make sure it’s watching only the areas you intend it to, without recording vehicles or pedestrians passing by.            Our proprietary algorithms can use our cutting edge image-recognition technology to distinguish between human and other sorts of movement, so you won’t get false alarms from falling leaves, vehicles, or animals. We provide a wifi base station with Chime (worth $39) FOR FREE! It provides free 8GB local storage that is capable of storing up to 120-day videos or snapshots* for you to review, download and share at your convenience. You have free and full access to the local storage! And it also serves as a dual-band Wi-Fi amplifier with up to 984ft range*, extending your Wi-Fi coverage throughout your home, and ensuring two-way audio and visual calls through your doorbell are never dropped. The Chime comes with a US Standard plug, but we also provide both the UK and European standard conversion plugs.   *The 120-day is tested when the doorbell records 10 motion clips every day and records for 15s every time.*The range is tested in an open and unobstructed environment.   The 360 X3 comes with a rechargeable battery (5000mAh), with a 6 months battery life* on a single charge. You can also choose the hardwired connection for continuous charging. Multiple means of preventing false-positives will help the doorbell to avoid burning through its battery on unnecessary recordings - saving only the most important interactions. Moreover, 360 provides an add-on battery pack that can be used to recharge the doorbell without disassembling or can be mounted to it for an astonishing 18 months of battery life* in total.*The battery life is tested when the doorbell detects motion 20 times every day and records a 20s video clip every time.     A video doorbell is only as good as the view it gives you, and the 360 X3 is top of the line. It features a state-of-the-art 5 Megapixel High-Resolution Camera to capture and preserve video in stunning 2496*1920 resolution so that you can even see the license plates on cars!   Our award-winning WDR (wide dynamic range) technology balances contrast, capturing startlingly clear details even in low light conditions or when figures are backlit. With the 360 X3 you’ll never be stuck guessing at backlit silhouettes again- you’ll always know what’s outside your door. Never be left in the dark! Crystal clear night vision ensures you’ll always know who's come knocking at night. Online shopping has never been more important, but your packages are vulnerable when they’re dropped off and you aren’t home. That’s why the 360 X3 features package arrival detection and pick up notification. The 360 X3 can automatically detect when there’s a package at your door and send you real-time notifications. And when someone picks up that package, you’ll be instantly notified, too.Featuring facial recognition, the doorbell can actually distinguish between friends, family, or strangers, so you always know who’s been to your home. Once something sets off the motion sensors, the 360 X3 immediately activates, capturing 10 to 30 seconds clips and sending them to you, instantly viewable in real-time and available for replay later. If necessary, you can share them or download them to your phone.  When passive protection isn’t enough, get active! The 360 X3 features the auto-siren to deter suspects that arrive where they aren’t supposed to be while you’re asleep or away. The 360 X3 will also send you real-time notifications when the siren activates. Concerned about keeping your data safe? All clips are encrypted with Banking Level Security (Chacha20) before being stored locally, or via cloud if you need more space by using the Amazon AWS server. Although the 360 X3 only takes seconds to install, it’s almost irremovable without the right pin to uninstall it. And the doorbell will sound a siren and send an alert to your phone if anyone attempts to remove or disable it without authorization. Additionally, it will record any such attempts as evidence, so there’s no chance a criminal can get away. Worried about installation? Don’t be! The 360 X3 can be installed in just seconds even by children and does not require professional help. You can choose between easy 3M adhesive installation to avoid damaging your wall, or drill installation for rough all surfaces.   Link your 360 X3 account to a digital assistant like Alexa or Google Assistant for easy hands-free use! Check your front door, message, or video chat with your visitors all via voice control. Your digital assistant will instantly notify you when someone approaches and show a live view of your front door on your device whenever someone presses the doorbell.   We already finished the development of hardware, and entered into mass production. Here are some demo videos we prepared as you requested. Please note the app UI surface is not totally finalized yet, and we will keep updating more videos and product updates to you.

<p><i>*Water contributes to the maintenance of normal physical and cognitive function, when consumed at least 2,0 L per day.</i></p>
</div></div>","Mitte is the first of its kind smart home water system that purifies and enhances water through a process inspired by the natural water cycle. It works in two simple steps: first, it purifies water with a proprietary distillation-based method, then it enhances the purified water with essential minerals. In 2015, Co-founder and CTO Faebian explored methods of water purification and mineralization as a side project to his university career. Inspired by the natural water cycle, he replicated the process in a machine. Two years later, that idea became the beautiful Mitte you see today.   ""Some 21 mineral elements are known to be essential for humans."" - World Health Organization, Report on Nutrients in Drinking Water, 2005. Water can be an essential source of minerals for the human body, and many minerals have higher bioavailability in water than in food, such as calcium and magnesium. However, other water purification systems remove important minerals in water along with the contaminants, creating water that’s only pure, but not mineralized. Mitte solves this problem by using mineral cartridges to replicate the process that occurs in nature when water flows through rocks, picking up minerals along the way. This unique process adds back all the minerals and trace elements that other water purifiers remove, giving you water that’s not just clean, but also full of essential nutrients. 
  Our replaceable patent-pending mineral cartridges come in three varieties, creating waters with different mineral properties. Now you can personalize your water to suit your lifestyle and taste. Whether you prefer a clean balanced everyday water, a sophisticated high mineral hit, or high PH water for detox and fitness. There’s a Mitte to suit every need.You can even specify the exact temperature (between 5 to 100 degrees Celsius, 41 to 212 Fahrenheit) and amount dispensed (between 50 to 1000 ml, 2 to 34 fl oz), effectively replacing your water kettle. A soft water with a balanced neutral taste and zero sodium, mitte® Balance is an everyday water, perfect for baby food preparation and tea or coffee brewing.  A crisp drinking water with a high mineral content and complex flavor profile. mitte® Vitality is great for those looking to benefit from essential minerals for improved physical and mental performance.  A high-PH water rich in minerals and antioxidants, mitte® Alkaline helps combat acidity and fights free radicals in your body. It also eases recovery after intense physical activities, leading to increased energy levels and better health.The Mitte app allows you to monitor current cartridge usage and set up (optional) demand-driven automatic ordering of new mineral cartridges. We will only send you a new cartridge when your current one is running low. 
 The truth is that our tap water is not as clean as we might like to think. It can contain contaminants such as bacteria, viruses, hormones, nitrates, fluorides and microplastics.As a case in point, The Guardian recently published an article on the widespread contamination of microplastics in our tap water. ‘Billions of people globally are drinking water contaminated by plastic particles with 83% of all samples - and 94% of US samples - found to be polluted’. These microplastics remain in the body for years after consumption, with unknown consequences.  The contamination is made very apparent with our machine. After purification, about 3% of the water that enters Mitte is collected as waste water. A brown cocktail of dirt, which otherwise ends up in our body. A side note: next to high concentrations of lead, Uranium (3x above the maximum allowance!) was discovered in our office’s tap water.
 Our patent-pending (EU patent n° EP17154125) distillation chamber is based on the principle of a thermoelectric heat pump, driven by two Peltier elements. We have termed the system Peltier-driven-Distillation (PDD). Catchy, right? 
Compared to other filtration-only systems such as pitcher filters or filters integrated into fridges, Mitte purifies water of all contaminants, such as harmful hormones, nitrates, fluorides, and microplastics. The result is perfect, pure water as the basis for re-mineralization. 
 Your Mitte machine is part of a connected ecosystem. Mitte syncs up with the mobile app to further personalize the experience, giving you additional control and insights.  The app enables you to:
Dispense water with specific water temperature and amount
Get real-time information on water quality and machine usage
Monitor mineral cartridge levels and manage cartridge ordering
and much more...
   With Mitte in your kitchen you have your bottling facility for mineralized water at the push of a button. In fact, as you can choose different mineral cartridges, it’s more like having three. Each cartridge produces 400 liters of mineralized water, enough to last around 3 months for a family of four. At a price of €40, €45, and €50 for mitte® Balance, Vitality, and Alkaline respectively, your Mitte water will cost between €0.10 ($0.12) and €0.13 ($0.15) per liter - cheaper and better than your overpriced bottled water brands. 
 The insatiable demand for bottled water is a huge problem. Plastic bottles are finding their way into the human food chain and polluting every natural system on the planet. A million plastic bottles are bought around the world every minute and the number will jump another 20% by 2021, creating an environmental crisis that will be as serious as climate change.Mitte eliminates the need for plastic bottles, leading to a fundamental reduction in plastic waste, water waste, and carbon dioxide emissions. Furthermore, we are looking at options of how to minimize our environmental impact by using bioplastics for our mineral cartridges and having a circular system, in which users send back their used cartridges.  Using the initial technology (based on the water cycle) as a starting point, Faebian and CEO Moritz began the process of turning the prototype - which was the size of a kitchen table - into a compact and efficient machine. They were soon joined by a passionate and experienced team from all over the world. The result is the high-performance Mitte that you see today. For those who enjoy geeking out on the tech please click here.  Design is at the heart of what we believe in. We consider design not just the pretty shell (yes that’s also important), but also an elegant and user friendly solution to an important problem.Mitte has been through hundreds of iterations over 18 months, from sketches and ideas to cardboard mocks-ups, 3-D prints and prototypes, all leading to our fully operational model.  Mitte Specs Sheet

And with a dual charging and wall-mounted storage dock, you’ll be able to charge both batteries at once, so you can always have a full backup ready to go. Our homes are full of different types of surfaces, each with different cleaning needs. But who wants to spend their time worrying over that? The Dreame T20 features four distinct cleaning modes that you can switch between at the press of a button, changing the suction level to fit any surface. Struggling with mites, or deep-cleaning shag carpeting? Max mode can clear it up in a snap. Curtains, car seats, or cushioning? Strong mode is what you need. Doing some light dusting? Try the Long-Lasting mode. And for everything else use our Automatic mode to adapt to your needs. By switching cleaning modes and brushes, you can optimize your power and cleaning time for any situation.Our electronic lock trigger offers continuous or non-continuous modes, to suit your needs. Continuous mode activates at the press of a button, and stops until you press it again. Just tidying up here or there? Switch to non-continuous mode, and the motor works only as long as you’re pulling the trigger, and will stop as soon as you release.Have a bad spill? Take care of it without getting your hands dirty! The Dreame Dust Cup is 0.6L larger in capacity than comparable models, and can be emptied with just one press before being washed. You can keep your hands clean the whole time. Need to clean the house, but afraid you’ll wake up your neighbour? The Dreame features 7-Stage noise reduction technology, so you can tidy up without fear of disturbing others in the next room. The advanced, lightweight design of the Dreame T20 weighs only 3.68lbs! This makes it easy to use, and easy to carry from room to room or floor to floor. Want to pack up the Dreame and take it in your trunk? Not a problem!  We offer a 2-year warranty for the main components of the Dreame T20. Please note that the warranty period complies with the applicable consumer laws in different countries or areas.

And that is the reason why Dreame has won the heart of consumers around world. So far Dreame has delivered over 1 million vacuum cleaners to happy owner all over the world. Since 3rd quarter of 2019, Dreame has become the NO.1 best-selling vacuum cleaner brand on Aliexpress, Spain. We strongly believe that more customers across the globe will join us in this vacuum cleaning tech revolution. Traditional vacuum cleaners with cords are heavy and not user-friendly. However, upgraded cordless vacuum cleaners often fell short on power when comparing to their chunky counterparts. Dreame has been committed to develop a cordless vacuum cleaner with the strongest power among its peers. Earlier this year, we firstly published Dreame V11 with 150AW suction power and 125000 RPM motor in Europe, which has been widely praised by our customers. This time we are excited to announce that its global version is launching on Indiegogo. Based on the same strong suction power as V11, Dreame T20 packs with smarter technologies, the intelligent all-surface brush can automatically adjust the suction according to different types of surface. Its swappable battery also doubles the runtime, helping you thoroughly clean the whole house with ease. During the campaign. We sincerely hope that many of you can join our Dreame Community from our Indiegogo campaign, where we could establish a strong and close connection through this platform, we are excited to hear all of your feedback and comments, so that we can constantly improve the product and provide you with better services.Dreame T20 products have entered the mass production stage.

Likewise, automatic toys often intimidate pets. TREATOI has proven to be the perfect solution: a feature-packed interactive pet care toy that keeps your pets entertained with rewards every few hours whether you're at home or not! Interactive Solo PlayTREATOI loves to play with your pet almost as much as you do, but unlike you, it can give your pet attention every few hours. Program TREATOI to gently release its play and sensory treat balls regularly.  Your furry friend will be stimulated to play with them and will appreciate the attention.Keeping your pet active and stimulated is only helpful if it can be done throughout the day. That’s why TREATOI is designed to be an interactive pet toy that can be customized to automatically dispense treat balls in intervals of 1-4 hours. According to the results of the survey on Kickstarter, we decided to offer one more time option of 30 minutes.  So TREATOI will have 5 LED lights as below: 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4 (30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours) Regular Physical Exercise TREATOI’s unique balls are meant to be played with, and your friend will want to.  Choose from a selection of rope tugs, bells, or treat dispensers to keep your pal worked out.TREATOIs unique exercise balls are a workout themselves.  They are as safe and robust as we could make them, and they need to be. Their exciting range of smells, sounds, and activities keep your pet busy, which in turn will keep your pet in great shape.TREATOI offers you another possibility for keeping your pet busy without using too many treats. The treat balls are not just for treats — they can also be used for any of the four play accessories (rag, rope, mini bell, LED ball).
 These play accessories are designed to stimulate and satisfy the pet’s five senses – sight, taste, touch, smell, and hearing.  *Both the transparent and mint balls can be deconstructed while the blue ball is one cohesive unit. Regular Mental Exercise TREATOI’s comes with all the smells and bells your pal could want.  TREATOI will keep them exploring, guessing, and thinking, e.g., fully mentally active. This might surprise you, but while humans only have 5 million sensors in their noses (also known as olfactory receptors), dogs have 220 million sensors, and cats have 200 million sensors. As a result, research tells us that sense of smell is how dogs interpret the world, in the same way that humans use their vision. That’s why sniffing keeps them busy and prevents them from being bored.TREATOI helps to activate their brain functions by allowing them to smell treats in the treat ball—a stimulus that naturally addresses their instinctive needs while also relieving stress, preventing dementia, and reducing the effects of separation anxiety. Happy Daily RoutineWith TREATOI balls having great smells, fun activities, and giving snacks, it’s as stimulating as your pet playpark. They’ll help your pet go from missing you to looking forward to playing time with TREATOI as it gives your pet attention. TREATOI will become a regular, positive part of their day, building their physical and mental health.TREATOI can make your pet feel loved when you’re working or away.  TREATOI plays and stimulates your pet exactly as you would want to because you program TREATOI. TREATOI will get them active in mind and body, as it becomes a vital part of how they spend their day. Perfect Slow Feeder TREATOI also helps prevent scarf-and-barf with food. It is superior to a multi-compartment timed feeder because cats and dogs have to work at getting all the food out of the balls so it can't eat it all immediately. Strong, Durable & Eco-friendlyTREATOI has been created to be strong and durable— using a rigid material, polycarbonate for the structure, these balls are ready to roll and endure!We also use a natural rubber material for the rubber interactive balls that is neither harmful to the environment nor the pet. This material is slip-proof and chewable which prevents pets from swallowing the balls. It’s also not harmful to the environment and our pets.Our treat balls have holes on the top and the bottom, just in case. Product Review  1) German version (English subtitles)2) English version How It Works TREATOI is designed to be quick and easy with only two simple steps. STEP 1. Fill each ball with your furry friend’s favorite treats and play accessories (rag, rope, mini bell, LED ball).STEP 2.Place the balls into the dispenser and set the timer.That’s it! TREATOI will dispense a treat ball at your set intervals for your pets to play with. Easy To CleanCleaning is simple. Treat balls can be washed in warm water, and the dispenser can be wiped down with wet wipes.COVID-19 has altered our daily lives and routines. Walking your dog outside is suddenly not as accessible as it once was. So whether you’re working from home and need a way to keep your pet entertained during the workday or simply trying to keep your dog active during the pandemic, TREATOI has you and your pet covered. Playing with TREATOI is just as fun and stimulating as going outside.     ROICO is a pet startup headquartered in Seoul, South Korea.

Vektor works with your existing router to provide enhanced privacy and protection features that it lacks. How Vektor Works  Click to Expand Features    Advanced Firewall Protection At its core, the Q-Branch Vektor acts as an advanced firewall. It blocks incoming internet connections to devices on your home network unless you allow them. It watches what these devices are sending to the outside world, learns their expected behavior, and then raises an alarm when the device deviates from this pattern or connects to known bad sites. You can also easily restrict a device so that It can’t communicate with or compromise other devices In your home.   Secures Core Network ServicesVector secures the core services of your home network so that attackers and observers cannot modify them in the background. It provides a secured DNS server that uses strong encryption to hide the sites you are visiting from observers, your ISP and other applications. Malware sites are blocked and you receive notification if any device on your network starts connecting to suspicious networks.   Protects Your Smart DevicesInternet-connected ‘smart’ devices like security cameras and TVs have a horrible record of security vulnerabilities and are more likely to be under the control of an outside hacker than the person who purchased the device. Limit what these devices can connect to and who can connect back to that device: allow your connected device to communicate only with the manufacturer, or maybe prevent it from talking to systems outside your home network. We put you back in control of these devices!   Transparent VPN Router and VPN ServerWe enable you to send specific devices or your entire network through a Virtual Private Networking tunnel for privacy protection or to get around geo-blocking. No additional software to set up on your devices. Just flip a switch and the device uses the VPN tunnel for all connections. The built-in VPN server also lets you connect to your home network when you are out of the house, so even if you are traveling or in a coffee shop you get a secure tunnel back to your home network.   Ad Blocking and Privacy ProtectionAds and web trackers can be blocked per-device or across your entire network without needing special browsers or extensions. The web trackers that follow you from site to site disappear and malware delivered through ad networks is no longer something that you need to worry about. This doesn’t just remove annoyances from your web browsing sessions, it speeds them up!   Child-Safe Restrictions and Time LimitsSet restrictions and time limits on your child’s internet access. You can easily limit a tablet or laptop to kid-safe domains and know that they are protected. With scheduled access hours you can prevent a late-night Minecraft session, no more watching YouTube under the covers or after school. You can also set a weekly limit on total online time to help enforce screen time limits for your child.   Continuous Network MonitoringVektor is constantly watching your home network 24/7 looking for problems. It notices when new systems are connected and give you the option of isolating these systems. In addition to scanning traffic Vektor is constantly checking all of the devices on your network to detect known vulnerabilities and will notify you if something needs to be blocked or updated for your safety.   App Controlled and Easy to UseInstallation is as easy as plugging it into your network hub. There is no annoying web site to navigate to in your browser. Vektor is controlled via an app on your smartphone or tablet. A simple Interface lets you accomplish most standard security tasks, with advanced features available if you want to dig deeper. Push notifications inform you when a problem is noticed or a new device tries to connect to the inside of your network so that you can make the choice before bad things happen whether your at home or on the road.
 
How Do We Compare  You Need Counter-Intelligence on Your Side 24/7.  Your New Safe Setup 
Controlled by Smart App for iOS and Android The free iOS and Android app let you easily set up and manage Vektor.Enable Safe, Private Browsing On All Devices In addition to powerful cybersecurity features, the Vektor provides a virtual private networking router that uses your existing VPN account to extend protection to any device in your home—even those that normally do not support VPN software—such as a Smart TV or security cameras.Create Temporary and VPN-Only WiFi Networks On Demand With one click you can create a temporary network for guests so you don't need to share your home WiFi password. The Vektor can also create secure VPN-only WiFi networks to make the use of VPN tunneling as easily as switching WiFi networks. See All Connected & Previous Connected Network Devices Vektor shows you all devices that have access to your network, including devices you may have forgotten about.
