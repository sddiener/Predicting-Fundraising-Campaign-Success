<ul><li><strong>Premier Stepper  Motor</strong></li></ul>
<p>High quality motors result in high quality prints. A big problem for many printers is ripples after corners and having finer resolution steppers helps reduce that. Instead of a standard 1.8° stepper motor, Rose Go uses a 0.9° motor with twice the precision. This significantly improves fineness and accuracy.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Silent Stepper Motor Driver</strong></li></ul>
<p>One of the most common complaints about 3D printers is the loud noise that they make during printing. Rose Go has come up with an ingenious silent drive solution. Our StealthChop2 ultra-quiet technology can keep the motor sound under 10dB, much lower than typical printers.  </p>

<ul><li><strong> PEI Bed</strong></li></ul>
<p>Rose Go adopts the platform scheme of PEI+ steel plate. The detachable steel plate platform makes it easy for users to detach the model. PEI (Polyetherimide) has excellent high-temperature stability and can be used under -160° to 180° operating temperatures for a long time. Compared with the normal frosted bed surface, PEI material provides a better underside effect. It can make sure the bottom surface of the model is smooth enough and makes the stripping of the model easier than ever.</p>

</div><div> </div></div>","In today’s fast-moving, high tech world, 3D printers are crucial for the development of designers, engineers, entrepreneurs and a new generation of young people. So we concentrated on ease of use, reliability and performance in the creation of Rose Go.
Rose Go is the culmination of our long-term research and development work. It combines both aesthetic design and engineering performance along with user-friendly features. It looks great, works great, and delivers affordable 3D printing performance for everyone. 
  
 
 

 
 

 


 
 20-300μm Layer Resolution Delivers High Printing Quality 


 
 70mm/s Print Speed Makes it Print 2 Times Faster than Normal 3D Printer 


 High precision         The core components of Rose Go are metal, which ensures machine stability. And it’s Z-axis clearance gal assembly greatly improves print quality and accuracy.    

 
Premier Stepper  Motor
High quality motors result in high quality prints. A big problem for many printers is ripples after corners and having finer resolution steppers helps reduce that. Instead of a standard 1.8° stepper motor, Rose Go uses a 0.9° motor with twice the precision. This significantly improves fineness and accuracy.


 
 
Silent Stepper Motor Driver
One of the most common complaints about 3D printers is the loud noise that they make during printing. Rose Go has come up with an ingenious silent drive solution. Our StealthChop2 ultra-quiet technology can keep the motor sound under 10dB, much lower than typical printers.  

 
 PEI Bed
Rose Go adopts the platform scheme of PEI+ steel plate. The detachable steel plate platform makes it easy for users to detach the model. PEI (Polyetherimide) has excellent high-temperature stability and can be used under -160° to 180° operating temperatures for a long time. Compared with the normal frosted bed surface, PEI material provides a better underside effect. It can make sure the bottom surface of the model is smooth enough and makes the stripping of the model easier than ever.


 

 
Auto-Leveling
Rose Go uses the most advanced 16-point leveling algorithm. The induction sensor in the automatic leveling machine detects the distance between the print head and the bed. Leveling is easier than ever, making print set up fast and simply for beginners.  
 Filament Run Out Detection
For most 3D printers, the accidental disconnection of material often results in failed prints. However, with Rose Go, you don't need to worry about this. The printer includes a system to detect run out filament that constantly monitors the material and avoid such errors.  

 
Plug & Play
Rose Go is plug & play and can be set up in minutes. It is designed to be easy enough that even beginners can quickly get started and begin their creations in 3D. The screen allows the user to pause and save during the print process. Real-time adjustment of printing speed, printing nozzle temperature for better printing tasks.

 
Software Supported
Rose Go includes its own easy to use software - Rose3D. To begin your creation you simply drag and drop a print file onto Rose3D to preview the Gcode. The printer is also compatible with other popular slicer software if you prefer, such as CURA or Simplify 3D.


 
 


 
 

 Reliability is the issue that people care about the most. So we put a lot of effort into that. For the main structure of the equipment, we use the aluminum-plastic composite plate, which is composed of two aluminum sheets sandwiched by polyethylene. After the assembly, we used three integral injection parts to form the body resulting in excellent overall stability and stable, reliable printing. 
 
 Design Philosophy 
We asked ourselves the question…” what makes a good 3D printer?” We know from years of experience using various printers on the market that low cost and high quality are difficult to achieve simultaneously. Low cost printers require higher maintenance and lack durability while higher quality printers cost more and are more difficult to learn to use.  
 

Our summation of the perfect combination for a high value 3D printer is… 
""Engineering performance + Aesthetics design + Ease of use""
A good 3d printer has to perform with a high level of detail and quality, have features that are the most essential to users, and have a unique and pleasing aesthetic design that makes it intuitive and easy to use for better user experience. 

For the main structure of the equipment, we use the aluminum-plastic composite plate, which is composed of two aluminum sheets sandwiched by acrylic. The material is easy to manufacture even if it meets the requirements of structural engineering. After the assembly, we used three integral injection parts to package, and the whole after the transfer was loaded tightly for the second time. Get the overall stability, output stable printing effect.

ImageAI - An AI Commons Project
          The ImageAI library is a free and open source Python library that was first released 3 months ago to provide students, researchers and developers of every level of expertise and in any where in the world  state-of-the-art Computer Vision technologies to build applications and systems that has high performance artificial intelligence, working completely off the internet and in their control. The ImageAI project has been embraced by undergraduate and graduate students, researchers, developers and experts in big corporations from around the world who are using the incredible features contained in the library to easily create state-of-the-art  artificial intelligence products and solutions with the few and simple to use codes that ImageAI provides. 
          Current version of ImageAI provides implementations of deep learning algorithms which allows you to perform Image Recognition, Object Detection,  detecting objects in Video and Live-feeds, Video and Camera feeds analysis, training Custom Recognition models and recognizing objects with the models. All of these is possible with ImageAI by just installing the dependecies, ImageAI  itself and run codes as few as  5 simple lines of code and not more than 15 lines of code. ImageAI provides incredible abstractions to algorithms like SqueezeNet, ResNet, InceptionV3, DenseNet, RetinaNet and YOLOv3. ImageAI  saves you the herculean tasks of writing implementations of these algorithms using thousands of lines of code and the need to study the complex mathematics involved.
 
 

We need your Support to provide more powerful features.
We have started work on adding more advanced features to ImageAI as well expand its reach by providing versions for the Android Development Platform, iOS Development Platform and .NET Development platform. We will be using the funds raised to do the following:

Train a wide range of recognition and detection models that cover many fields of practice
Provide equivalent models of all features for Android, iOS and .NET platforms
Run performance and compatibility tests on a wide range of devices for each platform.

          We have provided flexible contribution options to fit whatever amount you can provide to support this project. We will be providing an exclusive, free and fully packed E-book that contains lots of code samples and full codes for many projects that will be powered by ImageAI for all contributions from $200 and above by December. Also, we are providing exclusive and free tickets to all future events on ImageAI for all contributions from $500 and above. Find all details in the perks section.
          We are really looking forward to achieving our target goal to raise the full amount we need to ensure all the features we promised can be achieved. We encourage everyone to contribute to this campaign and also share it to friends and family to help us achieve the target amount so that we can provide all we have mentioned for the project.

<p>My name is Michael (Mike) McAleer and I’m a 55 year old idea
man. I say idea man because there is always some idea running through my head
but I don’t usually have the means to make them come true…until now. I came
across a problem and had an idea. Then came a Christmas present from my wife, a
membership to TechShop Pittsburgh and there I found a way to make an idea a
product but first I have a little story to tell.</p>
<p>Way back in the olden days, you know, dial phones, 45 RPM
records and black and white televisions, (at least we had television even
though there wasn’t cable) cars had big trunks, real bumpers and plenty of
openings to run a piece of rope or twine through. Then came push button phones,
cassette tapes and color television. (We still didn’t have cable.) The cars
still had nice size trunks, real bumpers and plenty of openings for that rope
or twine. Now we have cell phones, digital music and High Definition flat
screen televisions (and cable). What we don’t have are big trunks, real bumpers
(those things molded onto our cars aren’t really bumpers) and anyplace to run
rope or twine through our trunk lids. Making cars lighter, more fuel efficient
and quieter has pretty much done away with all of that. Now comes the problem,
if I can’t run rope through my trunk lid and around my bumper, how am I going
to keep my trunk lid held down while carrying a large object in my trunk?</p>
<p>This very problem drove me nuts. I’d go to the lumber yard,
get some 2X4’s for a project but, I don’t have a truck or a van, just a two
door coupe. My rear seats fold down to expand the space but the entire 8 foot
length doesn’t fit in the car. There is always some, maybe a foot that hangs
out the back. I’d stand there with a long piece of rope in my hand wondering
where am I supposed to put this? Somehow I’d get it tied down but it was more
luck then anything else. The entire time that I’m looking for a place to tie my
rope, one thing kept staring me right in the face. It was the trunk’s own lock.
There should be a way to use that to tie down my trunk lid. So, not knowing of
one I had to make one myself.</p>
<p>Introducing the<strong> “Cloz-it trunk securing system”.</strong> (Pat.
Pending) This handy little box works with just about any existing trunk lock on
the market. The molded loop on the top of the box pushes into the lock causing
the lock to close around it. Extend the hook on the retractable cable and
attach it to the other part of the trunk lock. Now, just close the trunk as far
as you can and lock the cable in place with the slide lock on the bottom of the
box. You are now ready to go. When you reach your destination, unlock the slide
lock, unhook the cable and open the trunk. To release the box just unlock the trunk
and the box is free to store away until the next time.</p>
<p>Sound like a great idea? I know that I think it is but of
course, I invented it. Now I need your help to make it a reality. I’m trying to
raise enough money to finish the patent process and get it out of the prototype
phase and into production. Get in on the ground floor of what I think is a
fantastic product.</p>
<p>There it is. You’ve met me briefly and now you’ve read about
my idea and product. I’m very excited about the possibility of seeing this idea
come to life and hopefully become a real product out on the market. There is no
guarantee that no matter how fantastic I think <strong>Cloz-it</strong> is that it will take
off. But there is only one way to find out. Keep moving forward and here is I
need to raise money for the phases that are coming up. Here is how I’m seeing
the breakdown:</p>
<p>To move forward to a full patent (<strong>Cloz-it</strong> it currently
protected by a Provisional Patent) and that involves Patent Attorneys and of
course they are not cheap. I’m estimating <em><strong>$5000 - $7000</strong></em>.</p>
<p>I need to continue to work out the design. I think I have a
pretty good one now but everything can be improved. Currently I’m on version
5.1 but I’m always looking to make it better. I’m also working on a <strong>Cloz-it</strong>
plus, a trunk securing system that includes LED lights to alert drivers behind
you of an open trunk and the possibility of something extending over the normal
bumper. Estimate for this is about <em><strong>$1500</strong></em> to continue working at TechShop and purchasing
materials.</p>
<p>The third part of this fundraising push is moving <strong>Cloz-it</strong>
from prototype to an actual demonstration project. The 3D printed model is good
but it isn’t the best way to proceed. First of all, each one takes about 4 ½ hours
to make. Secondly, there are faster and cheaper ways to make it so that the
sale cost is more favorable to consumers. I’d like to see a price point of
$14.99 - $19.99. To begin working on this I’m estimating a start of <strong>$1500</strong>. I’ll
probably need more but I’m hoping that the patent won’t be that costly and I
can put some of that money towards the production.</p>
<p>If my math is correct this is a total of <strong>$10,000</strong> (minus
fees) and I put the goal at 30 days. I guess I’m using this as a barometer of
interest. If <strong>Cloz-it</strong> is as fantastic as I think it is then funding should come
rolling in. If the money doesn’t then maybe I need to look at it again, back to
the drawing board as it were. Please help me see this happen. Donate as much as
you can, spread the word or just give me some positive feedback. I even welcome
constructive criticism and ideas that you might have to make <strong>Cloz-it</strong> better. My
email address is at the bottom. I also welcome any inquiries about me, my
background and/or the product.</p>
<p>Thank you all for your support and interest. I figure if you
are still reading at this point you must have some interest. As I said, I’m
working on version 5.1 and when I have a finished, working prototype I’ll make
a video of <strong>Cloz-it</strong> in action and post that here so check back.</p>

The advantage of printing on mold surface

Increase of surface quality and printing speed was already mentioned. Next advantage of printing on mold surface will

<h3>So.. what's the back story?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>That's a good question. Well, let me start off by introducing myself. My name is Donna, the awkward introvert.  At an early age, I noticed something very unique about myself which was that I struggled to articulately put my thoughts into words. People would ask me questions, which I could perfectly answer in my head, but trying to put those thoughts into words... well that's when I sorta got stuck and fumbled for words. Growing up, I was very jealous of people who confidently spoke in a large crowd. I would imagine myself giving an inspiring speech in front of thousand people. Ha! I know I had big dreams.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1501342836/s0srhixz73pymzkvl0jc.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>I convinced myself that maybe I was just slow and not smart enough, so I decided to shut myself down especially in front of other people. Instead of following my passion, I chose a course at university which I thought would prevent me from speaking a lot(accounting). Ugh! I can't wrap my head around how many presentations I avoided in school. I got a job which I hated. It was obvious that I settled in life and wasn't living up to my fullest potential.I hindered myself from following my dreams and kept silence.<strong><i> But hey! at least I had a job right?</i></strong>  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Fast forward three years later. On a usual boring Sunday afternoon, I was casually browsing through Facebook when I came across a quote which changed my life forever. The quote said:</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>""Consult not your fears but your hopes and your dreams. Think not about your frustrations, but about your unfulfilled potential. Concern yourself not with what you tried and failed in, but with what it is still possible for you to do."" </i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>-Pope John XXIII </i></p>
<p><i>I'm not kidding you</i>, literally, a light bulb went off in my head! At the age of 24, I decided to eagerly focus on finding <i>my purpose in life</i>. I have always wanted to become an entrepreneur but my fear and lack of self-confidence hid me away. I may never become the best public speaker but what if there was a possibility of helping myself and others who suffer from the same problem? This is when <strong>Hey You, Help</strong> was born.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>What exactly is Hey You, Help? </h3>
<p><i><strong>Wait wait.</strong>.. First, why did you choose the name Hey You, Help?!  </i></p>
<p>Well! I  just wanted to come up with a name that sounded <i>friendly</i>, <i>non-intimidating,</i> <i>casual </i>and most importantly <i>welcoming</i>.  I want the website to represent a comfortable and a friendly community.</p>
<p>Hey You, Help (HYH) is an online community using video and voice call to connect customers with coaches to develop their public speaking and communication skills in their specific areas.</p>
<p>The official website is <a href=""http://heyyouhelp.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.heyyouhelp.com  </a>It will be officially launched in 2 months after enough funding is raised, however, you can still visit the site and follow our social media icons for future updates.</p>

<p><i>This is our homepage</i></p>
<p>Hey You, Help is run by two users</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>The customer</strong> - Can sign up and purchase services from coaches to improve themselves. (Like myself)</li>
<li>
<strong>The freelance coach</strong> - sign up, post jobs and get paid for their services. They are called freelance coaches because we are looking for self-employed coaches who can flexibly offer their services.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong><i>HYH is not just a marketplace!</i></strong></h3>
<p><strong><i> </i></strong>But it is a community designed for users to network, share ideas and build relationships with each other. The platform offers a forum where users can share information. We offer support to our freelance entrepreneurs through training, we offer freelance contests to inspire our amazing coaches.

</div></div>","So.. what's the back story?
 
That's a good question. Well, let me start off by introducing myself. My name is Donna, the awkward introvert.  At an early age, I noticed something very unique about myself which was that I struggled to articulately put my thoughts into words. People would ask me questions, which I could perfectly answer in my head, but trying to put those thoughts into words... well that's when I sorta got stuck and fumbled for words. Growing up, I was very jealous of people who confidently spoke in a large crowd. I would imagine myself giving an inspiring speech in front of thousand people. Ha! I know I had big dreams.  

I convinced myself that maybe I was just slow and not smart enough, so I decided to shut myself down especially in front of other people. Instead of following my passion, I chose a course at university which I thought would prevent me from speaking a lot(accounting). Ugh! I can't wrap my head around how many presentations I avoided in school. I got a job which I hated. It was obvious that I settled in life and wasn't living up to my fullest potential.I hindered myself from following my dreams and kept silence. But hey! at least I had a job right?  
 
Fast forward three years later. On a usual boring Sunday afternoon, I was casually browsing through Facebook when I came across a quote which changed my life forever. The quote said:
 
""Consult not your fears but your hopes and your dreams. Think not about your frustrations, but about your unfulfilled potential. Concern yourself not with what you tried and failed in, but with what it is still possible for you to do."" 
-Pope John XXIII 
I'm not kidding you, literally, a light bulb went off in my head! At the age of 24, I decided to eagerly focus on finding my purpose in life. I have always wanted to become an entrepreneur but my fear and lack of self-confidence hid me away. I may never become the best public speaker but what if there was a possibility of helping myself and others who suffer from the same problem? This is when Hey You, Help was born.

 
What exactly is Hey You, Help? 
Wait wait... First, why did you choose the name Hey You, Help?!  
Well! I  just wanted to come up with a name that sounded friendly, non-intimidating, casual and most importantly welcoming.  I want the website to represent a comfortable and a friendly community.
Hey You, Help (HYH) is an online community using video and voice call to connect customers with coaches to develop their public speaking and communication skills in their specific areas.
The official website is www.heyyouhelp.com  It will be officially launched in 2 months after enough funding is raised, however, you can still visit the site and follow our social media icons for future updates.

This is our homepage
Hey You, Help is run by two users


The customer - Can sign up and purchase services from coaches to improve themselves. (Like myself)

The freelance coach - sign up, post jobs and get paid for their services. They are called freelance coaches because we are looking for self-employed coaches who can flexibly offer their services.

 
HYH is not just a marketplace!
 But it is a community designed for users to network, share ideas and build relationships with each other. The platform offers a forum where users can share information. We offer support to our freelance entrepreneurs through training, we offer freelance contests to inspire our amazing coaches. We also support other users who may not have public speaking anxiety.  For example,  those whose first language is not English and may need support in a job interview, speeches, school projects etc.
 
  
Image above shows examples of  some of the jobs freelance coaches can post on the platform

This shows the freelancer's order statistics, jobs completed with ratings and feedbacks from customers.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I have been drawn to the siren song of the markets for a long time.  And, just like the song of the sirens, the markets can be deadly.  The first stock I bought was Ryan's Steakhouse, from a cold call by a stock broker.  That was just a couple of weeks before the crash of October, 1987.  I was a contrarian indicator!</p>
<p>In the late 90's, I took a course called Optionetics and proceeded to create a piece of software named <a href=""http://optioninsight.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Option Insight</a> that was rather popular at the time.  I even had a couple of offers to buy my source code for $100,000.  I still kick myself for turning them both down.</p>
<p>Since then, I have studied so many trading systems, markets, and gurus that I have a swirl of ideas in my head from every chart I analyze.  I have spent tens of thousands of dollars trying to find an edge to beat the markets.  And I have driven myself batty in the process.  Many of you reading this have also traveled these roads.</p>
<p>Finally, this spring, I took a combination of things I had learned about the markets and started trading a system that I now call Nanotrades.  To be honest, it has exceeded my expectations.  It is by far the easiest, most successful trading I have ever done.  It is really easy to do, and I almost never have losing trades.  I know, it sounds too good to be true.  So I will have to prove it to you.</p>
<p>I have been trading this retirement account of my father's since May 30, 2017.  (Your father's retirement account is not something you want to lose!)  I have posted every day's statement at the <a href=""http://tradeunafraid.com/category/tradeunafraid/sfad/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Trade Unafraid blog</a>, but I will hit the highlights for you here, so you can see how this amazing system makes about 3% each month.</p>
<p>Here is the first daily statement, before I had place any trades.  So the account starts with $99,750.03 in cash.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503272992/pbcp8nnap0nauni8ffku.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>By the end of May, two trading days later, the cash balance was nearly $101k, and the net liquidating value was up slightly.  Net liquidating value is what the account would be worth in cash if you were to close all open trades at their current price.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503273153/l2i0xgsge9eygamkbb8k.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>By the end of June, the cash balance was over $104k, and the net liq value was over $102k.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503273241/pmf0k2ujd6wjakryrdj5.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>By the end of July, the cash balance was just under $106.7k, and the net liq value was $106k.</p>

<p>As of Friday's close on August 25, the cash balance is over $109k, and the net liq value is $108.7k.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503855971/xansaqtmf5zhbjtzuu2h.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>At the end of September, the cash balance was $113.5k, and the net liq value was $112k.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506886200/rxbwyyakv3k61dkotxk7.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Here is the daily net liquidating value chart since inception:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506886609/ck3trry9polxri1jai3c.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>And that performance is even after two pretty nasty drops in the market in the past two weeks, as you can see in the chart below.  Because Nanotrading does not force you to pick a direction or predict what the market will do, all but the most dramatic market moves will have no effect.  That's the beauty of scalping <i>from a distance</i>!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503273959/jfyrxe2vhc8l7wfz8ebg.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Why did I just go through all of that proof?  Because, I -- perhaps like you, too -- have looked under every rock in the trading education industry for the Holy Grail of trading.  There are so many claims, so many empty promises, that I thought it was important to show you exactly what I'm doing for my parents with their real money.</p>
<p>Trading is not a joke.  This is your hard-earned money you're playing with.  Your future, your kids' future (or your parents' future!), your financial well-being are all at stake.  You don't want to lose it.  You really want to succeed at this enticing game called trading.</p>
<p>So many marketers make it look so easy to make money in the markets.  But you spend money on their products, and then maybe you have some success, maybe not.  The amount that I've lost on disappointing trades is even greater than what I've spent on all of the education, tools, and indicators.  It adds up to a lot of hard-earned money lost, a lot of heartache, and a lot of stressful, disappointing trades.</p>
<p>That's not to say that there are not worthwhile educators out there.  I've actually had an excellent experience with several.  Sure, there are rip-offs out there.  But for the most part, I've found value with many, many courses I've taken.</p>
<p>The thing is, just like a broken clock is right twice a day, any trading system wins sometimes.  That's really what makes a market.  For every trade, there is a buyer and seller.</p>
<p>And that's what makes trading so frustrating.  You win some, you lose some.  Over and over.  For me, over the years, it's been three steps forward, roughly three steps back.  Sometimes two steps back, sometimes four steps back.  But, overall, it's been a lot of activity, work, and stress for not a lot of reward.</p>
<p>But finally, I can do <i>this</i>.  <i>With real money</i>.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503274768/ugrovusjyvucpzrlacij.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Now that I've created this system, this long-sought triumph, I want to share it with others who have struggled as I have.  Look at that equity curve.  Isn't it beautiful?  Isn't that what you've been searching for all these years?  It is a steady climb up and to the right.  No dramatic drawdowns, and you don't have to have a crystal ball to pull it off.  It's based on probabilities and option greeks.  Simple and beautiful.  And profitable.</p>
<p>The thing is, it's going to be a lot of work to put this training together.  And I have a lot to learn to produce such a training.  So, rather than ""build it and [hope that] they will come,"" I am turning to you fine folks to take a leap of faith.  If you buy it, I will build it.  :-)  Hopefully, with the evidence that I have provided here and at <a href=""http://tradeunafraid.com/category/tradeunafraid/sfad/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Trade Unafraid</a>, you can see how worthwhile it will be.</p>
<p>You're probably wondering what it takes to trade this system.</p>
<h3>What You Need To Know</h3>
<p><strong>Time</strong>:  I place trades two or three times per week.  I would estimate that I spend about twenty minutes during each session.  Time of day does not matter.  You can place these trades day or night, though I prefer to place them during the day session between 9:30am and 4:15pm Eastern.</p>
<p><strong>Money</strong>:  We are trading options on the S&amp;P eMini futures contract (ES).  <a href=""http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/equity-index/us-index/e-mini-sandp500_performance_bonds.html?foi=O&amp;optionProductId=138#sortField=exchange&amp;sortAsc=true&amp;clearingCode=ES&amp;sector=EQUITY+INDEX&amp;exchange=CME&amp;pageNumber=1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The margin on each contract is $4200</a>.  I have used this same strategy in a much smaller account, and it still works.  Even if you can only trade one contract at a time, you can still have an equity curve that slopes up and to the right.</p>
<p><strong>Trading Permissions</strong>:  You will need the ability to trade futures and options in your account.</p>
<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>To get to know me professionally, take a look at <a href=""http://linkedin.com/in/leegrey"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">my Linkedin profile</a>.  Read the recommendations that my colleagues and bosses have written about me.  I am a sincere, decent, hard-working person who has created a legitimate trading system that can help you regularly take money out of the markets.  It has done that for me.</p>
<p>By funding me, you will help get this important strategy into more decent, hard-working peoples' hands.  You will help the small retail trader supplement their income, provide for their kids, and have an enjoyable retirement.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So what's in this for you, the contributor?</p>
<p>As I've already said above, this is a trading system that you can do.  It is not complex.  It is not stressful.  It makes steady, impressive returns.  I can teach it to you.  And, for the higher tiers, I can provide additional support, as well.</p>
<p>I am not a certified or licensed financial adviser, so I cannot give personal advice.  And, of course, all of the standard disclaimers are very appropriate.  Trading is definitely risky, and you can definitely lose money.  What I have to teach you <i>is no exception</i>.  And past performance is no guarantee of future results.  All of that is absolutely true.  Don't take my enthusiasm and past success to mean that there is no risk.  We get paid by taking risk.  But these are calculated risks that have proven to be well worth it, even in the past two weeks with a couple of significant sell-offs.</p>
<p>Every contributor from $500 and up will receive the full Nanotrading training.  You will also get my awesome Excel spreadsheet that I use to track my positions, evaluate risk, and know exactly where I stand at any time.</p>
<p>Contributors at the $1000 tier will get a number of additional perks including access to a private Facebook group and notifications of my orders as I place them.  There is no better way to get up to speed on Nanotrading than to learn of my orders as I place them and to be able to confer with me and other traders in the Facebook group.</p>
<p>In addition, I've made progress on several other trading systems over the past year.  It's been a year of intense R&amp;D.  So being part of the inner circle means you will be the first to hear of new successes, such as automated trading systems and other things I've been working on.  There's some very exciting stuff in there.  As an example of the kinds of things I have been working on, take a peek at the original strategy at <a href=""http://tradeunafraid.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Trade Unafraid</a>, which I have yet to offer for sale.  It is a much slower process than Nanotrading, but it demonstrates the kind of trading systems I have been working on.  </p>
<p>I hate losing money, and <a href=""https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/n/nielsbohr130288.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">I hate having to rely on predicting the future correctly</a> in order to win.  So my strategies revolve around alternative approaches to the markets.  If you're a Star Trek fan, this is my solution to the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobayashi_Maru"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kobayashi Maru</a>.  :-)</p>
<p>Creating this training is going to be a significant effort to fit into an already busy life.  Your support will ensure that the effort and sacrifice is worthwhile.</p>
<p>And if you are not a trader, please spread the word to any traders you know.  They will thank you for it!</p>
<p>Thank you for your support!</p>

So many marketers make it look so easy to make money in the markets.  But you spend money on their products, and then maybe you have some success, maybe not.  The amount that I've lost on disappointing trades is even greater than what I've spent on all of the education, tools, and indicators.  It adds up to a lot of hard-earned money lost, a lot of heartache, and a lot of stressful, disappointing trades.
That's not to say that there are not worthwhile educators out there.  I've actually had an excellent experience with several.  Sure, there are rip-offs out there.  But for the most part, I've found value with many, many courses I've taken.
The thing is, just like a broken clock is right twice a day, any trading system wins sometimes.  That's really what makes a market.  For every trade, there is a buyer and seller.
And that's what makes trading so frustrating.  You win some, you lose some.  Over and over.  For me, over the years, it's been three steps forward, roughly three steps back.  Sometimes two steps back, sometimes four steps back.  But, overall, it's been a lot of activity, work, and stress for not a lot of reward.
But finally, I can do this.  With real money.

Now that I've created this system, this long-sought triumph, I want to share it with others who have struggled as I have.  Look at that equity curve.  Isn't it beautiful?  Isn't that what you've been searching for all these years?  It is a steady climb up and to the right.  No dramatic drawdowns, and you don't have to have a crystal ball to pull it off.  It's based on probabilities and option greeks.  Simple and beautiful.  And profitable.
The thing is, it's going to be a lot of work to put this training together.  And I have a lot to learn to produce such a training.  So, rather than ""build it and [hope that] they will come,"" I am turning to you fine folks to take a leap of faith.  If you buy it, I will build it.  :-)  Hopefully, with the evidence that I have provided here and at Trade Unafraid, you can see how worthwhile it will be.
You're probably wondering what it takes to trade this system.
What You Need To Know
Time:  I place trades two or three times per week.  I would estimate that I spend about twenty minutes during each session.  Time of day does not matter.  You can place these trades day or night, though I prefer to place them during the day session between 9:30am and 4:15pm Eastern.
Money:  We are trading options on the S&P eMini futures contract (ES).  The margin on each contract is $4200.  I have used this same strategy in a much smaller account, and it still works.  Even if you can only trade one contract at a time, you can still have an equity curve that slopes up and to the right.
Trading Permissions:  You will need the ability to trade futures and options in your account.
About Me
To get to know me professionally, take a look at my Linkedin profile.  Read the recommendations that my colleagues and bosses have written about me.  I am a sincere, decent, hard-working person who has created a legitimate trading system that can help you regularly take money out of the markets.  It has done that for me.
By funding me, you will help get this important strategy into more decent, hard-working peoples' hands.  You will help the small retail trader supplement their income, provide for their kids, and have an enjoyable retirement.

What We Need & What You Get
So what's in this for you, the contributor?
As I've already said above, this is a trading system that you can do.  It is not complex.  It is not stressful.  It makes steady, impressive returns.  I can teach it to you.  And, for the higher tiers, I can provide additional support, as well.
I am not a certified or licensed financial adviser, so I cannot give personal advice.  And, of course, all of the standard disclaimers are very appropriate.  Trading is definitely risky, and you can definitely lose money.  What I have to teach you is no exception.  And past performance is no guarantee of future results.  All of that is absolutely true.  Don't take my enthusiasm and past success to mean that there is no risk.  We get paid by taking risk.  But these are calculated risks that have proven to be well worth it, even in the past two weeks with a couple of significant sell-offs.
Every contributor from $500 and up will receive the full Nanotrading training.  You will also get my awesome Excel spreadsheet that I use to track my positions, evaluate risk, and know exactly where I stand at any time.
Contributors at the $1000 tier will get a number of additional perks including access to a private Facebook group and notifications of my orders as I place them.  There is no better way to get up to speed on Nanotrading than to learn of my orders as I place them and to be able to confer with me and other traders in the Facebook group.
In addition, I've made progress on several other trading systems over the past year.  It's been a year of intense R&D.  So being part of the inner circle means you will be the first to hear of new successes, such as automated trading systems and other things I've been working on.  There's some very exciting stuff in there.  As an example of the kinds of things I have been working on, take a peek at the original strategy at Trade Unafraid, which I have yet to offer for sale.  It is a much slower process than Nanotrading, but it demonstrates the kind of trading systems I have been working on.  
I hate losing money, and I hate having to rely on predicting the future correctly in order to win.  So my strategies revolve around alternative approaches to the markets.  If you're a Star Trek fan, this is my solution to the Kobayashi Maru.  :-)
Creating this training is going to be a significant effort to fit into an already busy life.  Your support will ensure that the effort and sacrifice is worthwhile.
And if you are not a trader, please spread the word to any traders you know.  They will thank you for it!
Thank you for your support!",9.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div><p> </p><p> </p></div>","What is M.A.P.?The M.A.P. (Miniature Automotive Project) consists of lifelike 1:6 scale models that represent the fundamental systems that make up an automobile.The project consists of four kits to assemble and the combination of the four kits results in the formation of a generic model of the internal structure of an automobile and its main elements. In addition to the four kits to be assembled, a pre-assembled version of a 16-valve engine on the scale of 1:6 is also part of the project.   The body of the subassemblies is transparent, which enables visualisation   of the internal parts of the system. It is also possible to see the movement of each part inside the system, a feature that realistically reproduces the real movements of the internal part of an automobile. 
 
Once the campaign is complete and we are launched, we will be able to make each piece available separately You will be able to observe and compare the movements of each structure individually and together. In addition, the structures are transparent allowing a clear and objective view of the observed system. Complete Kit - Demonstration

 It shows what happens when the gear-shift lever is set to the desired gear. The repercussion of the movement is transformed into other movements through the “shifting level” shafts resulting in the synchronizer coupling of the chosen gear.  Note: In the video demonstration, the shaft is disconnected to be able to better show the movement, because it is very short, and almost imperceptible.
 
The movement of the shaft illustrates the entry of air and fuel into the cylinders as well as the exhaust gases from the explosion. It is 16-valve control (16V), i.e., 4 valves per cylinder.  The shafts are made of metal alloys, the valves of ABS or worked metal and the body of the cylinder head of transparent PC plastic.
 
 This image shows the crankshaft connection to the camshafts by a serrated belt. It is possible to observe an axle-shaft coming from the transmission gearbox connected to the engine. It also shows part of the intake manifold system and injector nozzles.  The serrated pulleys of the camshaft are made of a metallic material.   Engine System +Transmission System + Suspension System +Brake and Steering Systems

Engine System - Kits of parts that assemble a generic, transparent engine block that allows you to see the internal parts.
Transmission System - Kit of parts that assemble a front-wheel drive transmission system. The entire system is assembled in a transparent casing, allowing you to see the internal parts.
Suspension System - Kit of parts that assemble the front and rear axles of a modern vehicle.  The suspension is multi-link and is suitable for the front-wheel drive model.
Brake and steering System - Kit of parts that assemble the four-wheel disc braking system.   The Complete Kit is the combination of all of the above kits!  Complete Kit (Perk) Complete kit is the combination of 4 kits: : Engine System, Transmission System, Suspension System, Brake and Steering Systems. When you choosee the Complete Kit, you will recive each kit in 4 differents packages with spaces to store each piece.  You also will recieve a tool kit for free(only during crowdfunding period). All of the kits are made of injected ABS and PC plastic with metal alloy parts. Once all of the modules have been assembled, you will have a 1/6 scale model of a car. 
   
 

  Individual KitsIf you don't need the Complete Kit (Engine System, Transmission System, Suspension System, Brake and Steering Systems)  but you want a Miniature Model in 1:6 scale to assemble, you can choose the individual kit you prefer (Engine System, Transmission System, SuspensionSystem, Brake and Steering  Systems). 
Each individual kit includes instruction      manual and a special packaging with    space to store each piece. Assembled Engine 16-valve (Perk) In addition to the kits to be assembled, the already assembled electric version of a 16 V engine is also part of the project. Although it is a miniature, its clear material and scale allows a clear and objective visualization of the system being studied.Besides being recreational, it is an enriching activity very useful in the mechanical field. The video below shows the Motor Assembled Engine (Scale 1:6) : Once the campaign is complete and we are launched, we will be able to make each piece available separately M.A.P applications HobbyThe niche of technical modelling is a commonly practised activity. It encompasses a very large range of professionals from different fields.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Major profit is to be made on crypto currency and forex fiat, but the risks are high.</p>
<p>This project will allow me to adapt my highly profitable, but low risk forex triangular arbitrage strategy to work on cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Problem with forex is that it moves to fast with very few and short lived arbitrage opportunities.<br/>Crypto moves much slower, but in huge leaps, which creates big and regular arbitrage opportunities not seen in forex fiat currencies.</p>
<p>Triangular arbitrage work by buying 3 currencies in a circular fashion.</p>
<p>Example : You take your 1 bitcoin and buy ethereum, then take the ethereum and buy litecoin, then take the litecoin and buy back bitcoin.</p>
<p>You would expect to end with 1 bitcoin (minus transaction costs) seeing that you just bought in a circle, but because of market inefficiencies you will end up with either 1.1 or 0.9 bitcoins (exaggerated example) and therefore you can make 0.1 bitcoin profit every time you trade this circle during a profitable run by just playing the inefficiencies.</p>
<p>In theory you can not lose seeing that you will know ahead of time that you will make profit and only trade when you can make profit, but in practice there can be multiple problems like a slow internet connection, your pc the program runs on restarting, ex.. , but even then the amount you could lose during these unforeseen problem times is far outweighed by the overall profit and these problems are so few and far in-between that the drawdown is almost negligible for very low risk.</p>
<p>You also remain unaffected by price spikes and drops not connected to the base currency you use for even less risk.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I plan to make this program a fire and forget program that automatically generates a passive income for its users.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I want to create an automated program that will trade on a cryptocurrency exchange.</p>
<p>This program will run with the minimum to no settings so that it can be fully automated, without blaming the user of the wrong settings like other systems.</p>
<p>I have already partially created an automated EA/program for the forex fiat currency market, which I will adapt for use on a cryptocurrency exchange.</p>
<p>I need funds to allow me to take off work for 4 months while I develop and test this new program.</p>
<p>I also need funds to pay for my development tools. (laptop, internet, power, Online Servers, exchange testing funds, api licences if any for fast crypto exchange connection)</p>
<p>Once the project is complete and properly tested I will update this campaign with all the results and supply all people that donated more than $100 with the program for their own use.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Major profit is to be made on crypto currency and forex fiat, but the risks are high.
This project will allow me to adapt my highly profitable, but low risk forex triangular arbitrage strategy to work on cryptocurrencies.
Problem with forex is that it moves to fast with very few and short lived arbitrage opportunities.Crypto moves much slower, but in huge leaps, which creates big and regular arbitrage opportunities not seen in forex fiat currencies.
Triangular arbitrage work by buying 3 currencies in a circular fashion.
Example : You take your 1 bitcoin and buy ethereum, then take the ethereum and buy litecoin, then take the litecoin and buy back bitcoin.
You would expect to end with 1 bitcoin (minus transaction costs) seeing that you just bought in a circle, but because of market inefficiencies you will end up with either 1.1 or 0.9 bitcoins (exaggerated example) and therefore you can make 0.1 bitcoin profit every time you trade this circle during a profitable run by just playing the inefficiencies.
In theory you can not lose seeing that you will know ahead of time that you will make profit and only trade when you can make profit, but in practice there can be multiple problems like a slow internet connection, your pc the program runs on restarting, ex.. , but even then the amount you could lose during these unforeseen problem times is far outweighed by the overall profit and these problems are so few and far in-between that the drawdown is almost negligible for very low risk.
You also remain unaffected by price spikes and drops not connected to the base currency you use for even less risk.
 
I plan to make this program a fire and forget program that automatically generates a passive income for its users.

 
 
What I Need & What You Get
I want to create an automated program that will trade on a cryptocurrency exchange.
This program will run with the minimum to no settings so that it can be fully automated, without blaming the user of the wrong settings like other systems.
I have already partially created an automated EA/program for the forex fiat currency market, which I will adapt for use on a cryptocurrency exchange.
I need funds to allow me to take off work for 4 months while I develop and test this new program.
I also need funds to pay for my development tools. (laptop, internet, power, Online Servers, exchange testing funds, api licences if any for fast crypto exchange connection)
Once the project is complete and properly tested I will update this campaign with all the results and supply all people that donated more than $100 with the program for their own use.
People that donate more than $2000 will also get the source code of this program for their own use or just to verify that the code is clean with no hidden features like some other scaly programs out there and put your mind at ease.
As a stretch goal I still want to complete my Forex triangular arbitrage EA/program and if this campaign goes above $50000 then I will also complete the forex EA and supply the EA to those that contributed and also the source code to those above $2000.
For more detail about what I am planning then please look at a forexfactory thread I have created some time go that goes into a bit more detail and it also showcases the partial forex ea that I created to test the strategy long ago.

The globellColor team has carefully evaluated and mitigated all foreseeable risks and challenges, but may face unforeseen events. We have already successfully designed, created and shipped globellColorSuites without the additional stand. Each of the final sensors will be individually calibrated and checked to fulfill the highest quality standard.

Our delivery dates, as outlined in the campaign, are based on careful planning and our manufacturing experience with other crowdfunding campaigns, but may change due to materials, suppliers and unforeseen events. We will ensure that we keep each of our supporters fully updated. Conversely, it is important that all backers keep us updated of their address before we ship the final rewards. Any reshipping will require additional payments.",22.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Why back this project?</h3>
<p>My name is David Pavelsky and I am Active Duty Army until I retire next year. I designed this spinner as something I could play with at work, while in meetings, or just sitting watching TV. I always needed something to do with my hands. The initial design for the Tri-Spinner Fidget Toy™ came out great and was more spectacular than I could have imagined. After showing a few friends, they convinced me to try and see if I could sell a few. I did and that was the end of it. This was in May 2016. Come July I had more requests than I could possibly keep up with but I tried anyway. I have been super limited on how many I could produce and a lot of people have gone without or gone to products that they were not satisfied with and paid way too much money for.</p>
<p>With this campaign I want to be able to ramp up production to 40-50 spinners a day and keep the price point right where it is. My ultimate goal is to have 5 3D printers running non stop and be able to come up with more designs that the public will love. </p>
<p>I am currently running on 2 printers and have no time to prototype new products. If I can add 3 more printers to my workshop, I can provide all the spinners you all need and want and I can get you the new designs I have been promising.</p>
<p>Each spinner comes 100% complete with a 3D printed body (high quality ABS plastic is all I use for durability), a ceramic hybrid center bearing for the smoothest and longest spins, steel outer bearings of equal weight to get balanced spins every time and a set of finger pads already installed to allow for balance and holdability.</p>
<p>The hurdles I am currently trying to overcome is having my design taken as public property and folks trying to make their own but with lower quality and less attention to detail. I have overcome some of this by applying for a trademark on the name and currently in the process of getting a design patent filed for the design. </p>
<p>Every little bit will help make this dream a reality and get every one a spinner for their ever restless hands.</p>
<p>Help me help you, get the word out, let every one know that this is the one and only original Tri-Spinner Fidget Toy™. With your help, I can keep high quality fidget toys in the hands of the masses.</p>
<p>Thank you for all of your support!</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>microMighty is a simple to use embedded processor board for many applications.  It was designed to be easy to use and require no tools or libraries to install, nor does it require additional hardware to purchase, install and configure to get going. microMighty is Windows, Mac and Linux compatible, and can even be used directly from an Android phone or tablet.</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/9rfxP2lPbgo?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>microMighty contains Lua version 5.4.0, and special built in libraries that directly interface with the embedded hardware wich make working with the hardware simple without diluting the powerful capabilities of the embedded processor.</p>
<h2>Connectivity Simplified</h2>
<p>microMighty has a flexible pin library with which only one line of code is required to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Communicate with an I2C or SPI  sensor</li>
<li>Change the frequency or duty cycle of any PWM output</li>
<li>Control one or many neoPixel LEDs</li>
<li>Generate a pulse with microsecond pulse width resolution</li>
<li>Read an analog input</li>
<li>Many, many more things...</li>
</ul>
<p>microMighty can use ANY pin as an I2C or SPI port and almost every pin can have a PWM output. There is also up to 29 digital IO, 6 UARTs, 4 LEDs and 6 analog inputs.</p>
<h2>Parallel IO revised</h2>
<p>Any group of pins on microMighty can be used to make a parallel port of up to 32 bits wide. The pins can be arranged in any order of any length up to the 32 bits, and can even be the same pin in multiple positions.</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/FtGYT_TIJfE?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>Wondering what you would do with the same pin in multiple positions of a parallel port? When writing the same pin multiple times microMighty will split the parallel write at the duplicate! The example video above generates a pulse by toggling a 2 bit port that has both bits the same.  Two nibbles can be written to an 8-bit port by using the same 4 pin group two times in the same port group.  </p>
<h2>High-performance embedded processing</h2>
<p>microMighty uses the most powerful microcontroller available, the ARM Cortex-M7. The processor core runs at 216 MHz and includes hardware floating point operations! With this horsepower and math capacity, microMighty is perfect for processing data from sensors and embedded applications.</p>
<p>And, when the data is collected and processed, it can be streamed directly to a file on the 8 MB flash disk that is onboard using simple calls to the Lua IO Library.</p>

<p>microMighty was built on hardware that is powerful like Pi, but easy to use with embedded sensors and motors like an Arduino.  The simple to use Lua based interface makes quick work of interfacing with sensors, and building applications. Enabling the maker to spend less time typing in the IDE and more time in the lab experimenting with the hardware.</p>

<h3>Goal 1: Meet Our Funding Goal $30,000</h3>
<p><strong>microMighty </strong>will be configured to run Lua v5.4.0, with the base features planned for the project.</p>
<h3>Stretch Goal 1: $33,000</h3>
<p>When we reach $33,000 in funding I will complete the  <strong>microMighty </strong>enhanced version of the Arduino environment, and all backers get to choose if <strong>microMighty </strong>is delivered to you programed as an Arduino or with the Original Lua environment.</p>
<h3>Why we need funding</h3>
<p><strong>microMighty </strong>has been built in small batch quantities already, and has demonstrated a real potential as both a learning tool and a platform for making, but in order to make <strong>microMighty</strong> more accessible we have to reduce the cost and time associated with building the boards and procuring the materials.  Since there is a relationship between cost and quantity, we need to build larger batches to reduce the costs of the materials by allowing us to buy in bulk.  Your contribution to this campaign enables us to buy in bulk and to build larger production runs, making the <strong>microMighty</strong> board more affordable.</p>
<p>By contributing to this campaign, <i>you </i>are helping to make <strong>microMighty </strong>affordable for schools makers, and enthusiasts.</p>
<h2>Our Timeline</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522289042/v9jbqt62fb8wqkjw1mjg.png"" src=""""/></p> <h3>Risks and Challenges</h3>
<p>As with any hardware project there are always potential risks, however, most of the highly risky items have been already retired.  Presently there are working prototypes and the design of the core of <strong>microMighty </strong>is complete.  There is a plan for a re-spin of the hardware design following this campaign to incorporate feedback and to support design-for-manufacturing.  Working closely with our manufacturers will help to optimize the design for quicker and higher quality production and testing. </p>

</div></div>","Overview
microMighty is a simple to use embedded processor board for many applications.  It was designed to be easy to use and require no tools or libraries to install, nor does it require additional hardware to purchase, install and configure to get going. microMighty is Windows, Mac and Linux compatible, and can even be used directly from an Android phone or tablet.

microMighty contains Lua version 5.4.0, and special built in libraries that directly interface with the embedded hardware wich make working with the hardware simple without diluting the powerful capabilities of the embedded processor.
Connectivity Simplified
microMighty has a flexible pin library with which only one line of code is required to:

Communicate with an I2C or SPI  sensor
Change the frequency or duty cycle of any PWM output
Control one or many neoPixel LEDs
Generate a pulse with microsecond pulse width resolution
Read an analog input
Many, many more things...

microMighty can use ANY pin as an I2C or SPI port and almost every pin can have a PWM output. There is also up to 29 digital IO, 6 UARTs, 4 LEDs and 6 analog inputs.
Parallel IO revised
Any group of pins on microMighty can be used to make a parallel port of up to 32 bits wide. The pins can be arranged in any order of any length up to the 32 bits, and can even be the same pin in multiple positions.

Wondering what you would do with the same pin in multiple positions of a parallel port? When writing the same pin multiple times microMighty will split the parallel write at the duplicate! The example video above generates a pulse by toggling a 2 bit port that has both bits the same.  Two nibbles can be written to an 8-bit port by using the same 4 pin group two times in the same port group.  
High-performance embedded processing
microMighty uses the most powerful microcontroller available, the ARM Cortex-M7. The processor core runs at 216 MHz and includes hardware floating point operations! With this horsepower and math capacity, microMighty is perfect for processing data from sensors and embedded applications.
And, when the data is collected and processed, it can be streamed directly to a file on the 8 MB flash disk that is onboard using simple calls to the Lua IO Library.

Comparisons With Other Platforms

microMighty was built on hardware that is powerful like Pi, but easy to use with embedded sensors and motors like an Arduino.  The simple to use Lua based interface makes quick work of interfacing with sensors, and building applications. Enabling the maker to spend less time typing in the IDE and more time in the lab experimenting with the hardware.
Perks










Goal 1: Meet Our Funding Goal $30,000
microMighty will be configured to run Lua v5.4.0, with the base features planned for the project.
Stretch Goal 1: $33,000
When we reach $33,000 in funding I will complete the  microMighty enhanced version of the Arduino environment, and all backers get to choose if microMighty is delivered to you programed as an Arduino or with the Original Lua environment.
Why we need funding
microMighty has been built in small batch quantities already, and has demonstrated a real potential as both a learning tool and a platform for making, but in order to make microMighty more accessible we have to reduce the cost and time associated with building the boards and procuring the materials.  Since there is a relationship between cost and quantity, we need to build larger batches to reduce the costs of the materials by allowing us to buy in bulk.  Your contribution to this campaign enables us to buy in bulk and to build larger production runs, making the microMighty board more affordable.
By contributing to this campaign, you are helping to make microMighty affordable for schools makers, and enthusiasts.
Our Timeline
 Risks and Challenges
As with any hardware project there are always potential risks, however, most of the highly risky items have been already retired.  Presently there are working prototypes and the design of the core of microMighty is complete.  There is a plan for a re-spin of the hardware design following this campaign to incorporate feedback and to support design-for-manufacturing.  Working closely with our manufacturers will help to optimize the design for quicker and higher quality production and testing.

 There are many Ultrabooks on the market, but they are bulky and hard to carry. Last year, we have successfully launched a laptop and raised over $3.5 million. With an Intel x7-8750 processor and a 7-inch screen, it is lightweight, ultra-thin, and can be put into a handbag or pocket. We named it Pocket. It‘s the perfect laptop for light or mobile office crowds. Everyone loved it. This year, GPD Pocket 2 will redefine the ultimate portable laptop.  This is what GPD Pocket 2 offers for you:

UNIBODY Machined Magnalium Design: streamlined and fashionable

Fits in Your Pocket Easily: bring it with you anywhere

Lightweight, <550g: more compact than the GPD Pocket 1

7-inch Screen: just the right size for maximum productivity

Traditional Keyboard Design: minimum user adoption; type like you used to

Micro SDXC Card Slot and More USB A Ports: Expand storage space without a separate USB HUB

Active Cooling: rather than a passive cooling thin design that sacrifices performance
Superior Performance than Microsoft (m3) Surface Pro

Low Noise Operating Mode: caters to different user preferences
Compatible with All Chargers and Mobile Power Banks
    “Wherever you are, whenever you want, you can pull out GPD Pocket 2 from your pocket or purse and start working right away.”  You can use Photo  to act on your inspirations, anywhere and anytime.  Whether you are engaged in design work in: civil construction, decoration, industrial drawing, engineering, electronics, tailoring and so on, the GPD Pocket 2 is undoubtedly the best ultra-mobile productivity tool for you.  With GPD Pocket 2, you can work and communicate when and where it is needed, allowing you to improve work efficiency.  Using GPD Pocket 2 you can: monitor the stock market, commodity futures and foreign currency fluctuations all in real time. Time is money, so seize every second to improve your investment efficiency and success.  GPD Pocket 2 is also an excellent e-reader. Compared with traditional e-readers, GPD Pocket 2 possesses a larger storage capacity and supports more software and e-book formats. Download your favorite e-book anytime and anywhere.  GPD Pocket 2 gives you an immersive experience for watching movies and listening to music, offering an authentic private cinema for you.   With 2.5 times the performance of the previous generation Pocket, streamlined sleek and stylish design, UNIBODY machined magnalium construction rivaling the MacBook, the palm sized GPD Pocket 2 satisfies the tastes and mobile office needs of the most discerning business professionals.  At only 8mm at its thinnest section, the GPD Pocket 2 is 57% less thick than the previous generation GPD Pocket. It weighs only 510g, 410g less than Apple MacBook and 258g less than the Microsoft Surface Pro.  With the built in Optical Finger Navigation, you can operate with one finger for 360-degree rotation and movement anywhere. It can also replace direction key. The effect is comparable to the optical mouse. GPD Pocket 2 supports touch screen and the built-in multi-touch function makes it even more convenient.  GPD Pocket 2 has a 7-inch IPS 1920x1200 resolution screen, delivering more colors and higher contrast. With a 323 PPI screen, it provides a bright Retina display experience with better in screen details than the MacBook and new Surface Pro. The IPS-based screen has viewing angles up to 178° in either the horizontal or vertical. Use of In-Cell full lamination allows the Pocket 2 to have a screen that is thin, thus reducing the weight of the device. With a screen border of only 4mm, the Pocket 2 delivers an almost borderless viewing experience.  The keyboard has been ergonomically designed to ensure ease of use. Each keycap is independent of the others, and with their large surface area they offer an improved contact area between finger tip and keycap. Typing requires very little force and therefore can be more accurate. The Pocket 2 keyboard brings a comfortable feel, while the independent keys and non-adhesive keycaps, decreases the potential for pressing the wrong key.  GPD Pocket 2 uses the same Intel® Core™ m3-8100Y processor as the new Surface Pro. With 14nm fabrication, ultra-low voltage, low power consumption, 99.76MHz bus speed, 4GT/s OPI, the data transmission speed can read a peak of 4×10^9 times per second. It also has a 4 MB L3 Cache and provides fast and efficient processing and data recall.  GPD Pocket 2 is equipped with ninth-generation UHD Graphics 615, featuring 24 Execution Units and a max dynamic frequency of 900MHz. When parallel processing of graphics data for high throughput, UHD Graphics 615 can boost up to 350% resulting in smooth graphics and video playback.  The GPD Pocket 2 storage is capable of sequential read speeds of 267.35MB/s and sequential write speed of 120.10MB/s. Compared with the GPD Pocket, the read-write speeds have increased substantially. This means that boot up and software loading requires a lot less time, increasing your efficiency and productivity.  The biggest advantage of the GPD Pocket 2 is its active cooling design. All the most popular ultra-thin laptops on the market do not use active cooling, leading to fast frequency-reduction once the processor hits thermal limits. This reduces their effectiveness for both work and entertainment uses. With its fan based PC-level cooling solution, GPD Pocket 2 provides great performance.  The GPD Pocket 2 features a unique “one-button fan mute” mode which is a great boon for those who are sensitive to noise. You can work quietly or enjoy videos without system noise interfering with your experience.  Two USB A ports and one Micro SD card slot allows you to expand the storage to 2.4TB. The m3-7y30 supports the UHS 104 ultra-high-speed SD interface, with a bus speed up to 104MB/s. It also supports Micro SDXC cards. As tested, the read speed of a SanDisk 128GB Micro SD card was measured to be up to 88MB/s, and the write speed was up to 57MB/s.Notes: currently, the max USB capacity is 1TB and the max Micro SD capacity is 400GB。  The Pocket 2's Type C is a full-featured interface, you can connect to the Hub to extend the storage such as HDMI, VGA, RJ45, SD card, Micro SD card and U disk, etc. Meanwhile, you can also use Hub to charge Pocket 2.  GPD Pocket 2 supports fast charging based on the PD 2.0 protocol, it can be charged to half full in 30 minutes. Pocket 2 also supports almost all mobile phone chargers and mobile power banks. Just go with one power adapter for both of your Pocket 2 and cellphone. Meanwhile, you can easily find charging source at airport or in cafe for Pocket 2 (most places provide 5V/2A charge output standard).

<h3>Story</h3>
<p>We're the Z generation from Vietnam solving the problem about personal temperature, whether you feel too hot or too cold.</p>
<p>As a tropical country, we clearly understand how hot it is during the sunny season. Sometimes, it can reach up to 40 Degree Celsius but everybody still <i><strong>has to go out</strong></i> for work or other reasons. Climate change is happening and people are using more air-conditioners but it is actually a loop. So, we design this product with a hope of solving the problem for not just the people but the environment as well.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The problem</h3>
<p>Let's think about the last time you <i><strong>had to go out</strong></i> in the hot weather. What was your solution for that? Was it enough for you?</p>
<p><a href=""https://gifyu.com/image/y5Xh"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img alt=""Sequence-01_2.gif"" border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s6.gifyu.com/images/Sequence-01_2.gif"" src=""""/></a></p>
<p>Or ladies, do you <i><strong>feel chills during your period</strong></i>  in your office?</p>
<p><a href=""https://gifyu.com/image/y5XC"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img alt=""Sequence-01_1fb5112287ab34fe6.gif"" border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s6.gifyu.com/images/Sequence-01_1fb5112287ab34fe6.gif"" src=""""/></a></p>
<p>At times like these, do you wish the temperature was more comfortable?</p>
<h3>Our Solution</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Coolbrace will help you find your comfort with just a press on the button whenever you're feeling a little too hot or too cold.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1628922586/kzgjdan9cuw0nkm9egik.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>YOU WANT TO FEEL COOLER?</strong></p>
<p>Just press the<strong><i> left button</i></strong>, Coolbrace will cool you down to 17 Degree Celsius. It's like when you put a cube of ice on your wrist and then feel more comfortable in 15 minutes.</p>

<h3>How does it work ?</h3>
</div><div>
<p>According to the science research of Stanford and UC Berkeley University, when you cool down or warm up the sensitive areas that have many blood vessels and nerves such as the wrists, feet or napes,...; it will improve your overall comfort but will not change the body temperature.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1628923652/szqjcyxgw7w4jdrhw3hm.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>That’s why you feel more comfortable when leaving your feet out of the blanket at sleep or when drinking hot water in winter.</p>
<h3>How do you wear it ?</h3>
<p>Coolbrace is designed to wear flexibly. At this time, you can wear Coolbrace on the top or bottom of your wrist</p>

<p>Today, we carry more smart devices than ever before, and fewer of us are working in a traditional fixed office setting. This raises a real challenge in keeping all of our devices charged while we’re on the move. Every device seems to need its own charger, with power bricks often taking up more space than the devices themselves. The obvious solution would be to use one product to power all of your gadgets.</p>

This raises a real challenge in keeping all of our devices charged while we’re on the move. Every device seems to need its own charger, with power bricks often taking up more space than the devices themselves. The obvious solution would be to use one product to power all of your gadgets.

 

 
SuperTank Pro is the Ultimate Mobile Power Solution that allows working professionals to set up a workstation anywhere they need.
 



 
With its high powered 100W USB-C port, SuperTank Pro reimagines your charging experience. Charge your power-hungry 16” MacBook Pro at the same speed as the native power brick.  

 
SuperTank Pro can charge your devices lightning-fast, thanks to 100W max power output from a single USB-C port.
 
  Share power! Maxim 26,800mAh Battery Capacity enables more people to use SuperTank Pro while collaborating.  Explore, untethered. Power your phone for up to a week with a fully-charged SuperTank Pro.  The  26,800mAh capacity enables more usage time than smaller chargers. What’s more, advanced Samsung battery technology ensures peak efficiency for SuperTank Pro.  Charge 4 devices at the same time using SuperTank Pro’s convenient USB-C output ports. SuperTank Pro’s high-powered USB-C ports allow you to configure your work setup with endless creativity! SuperTank Pro takes the charging experience to a whole new level!The OLED display on SuperTank Pro gives you real-time information about your power usage and remaining charge, so you can plan ahead and make the best use of your mobile workstation. SuperTank Pro is the first portable battery that features an advanced TI battery fuel gauge, allowing for adaptive charging and power cell balance.As a result, the OLED screen can accurately display charging input and output status, letting you take control of your device power levels in real-time.Keep your SuperTank Pro compatible with the latest devices just by updating the firmware. No matter how you choose to charge SuperTank Pro, the USB-C outputs can be used to power and charge other devices at the same time. Talk about convenience!SuperTank Pro is made of an aluminum alloy which protects the internal components, to keep up with the demands of a mobile workplace. The color, material, and finish are similar to a MacBook.SuperTank Pro makes the most of its massive capacity and power output through the use of high-quality internal components, with a charging efficiency of up to 85%. Most batteries on the market operate at a lower efficiency, which means they may not charge your devices quite as well as you’d expect. SuperTank Pro can keep a phone charged through seven days of typical usage.The high-density battery cells pack more energy into less space, and the multi-layer PCB design allows for a compact and convenient form factor, minimizing the size of SuperTank Pro, with no wasted space.  SuperTank Pro monitors a variety of internal metrics in real-time for safety, efficiency, and device protection.SuperTank Pro’s power distribution algorithms automatically determine how the power should be distributed. The internal logic is designed to distribute power as needed to a variety of devices, from low power wearables like earbuds and smartwatches, to larger products like a robotic arm.SuperTank Pro can be recharged in 1 hour and 45 minutes when you use Zendure’s SuperPort S4, a pocket-sized charger capable of up to 100W output.Designed with a foldable AC adapter,  SuperPort S4 is easy to pack and carry, fitting in just about any small bag or pocket. SuperPort S4’s compact form is 30% smaller than Apple’s 96W charger and has 4 USB ports instead of just one. SuperPort S4 is widely compatible with the latest devices, like laptops, phones, tablets, Nintendo Switch and others. With 100W USB-C Power Delivery output, SuperPort S4 can provide full-speed charging for most of the latest USB-C high-power devices!SuperPort S4 supports mainstream smartphone fast-charge protocols including PD 3.0, QC 3.0, PPS 5A (for Samsung fast charge), AFC (for Samsung fast charge) and SCP/FCP 22.5W (for HUAWEI fast charge).SuperPort S4 supports 100-240V AC power and comes with 3 plug converters (AU/EU/UK) so you can use it in over 200 countries worldwide.Adapter Specifications:  SuperTank Pro is compatible with most USB solar panels. Now you have two reasons to enjoy a sunny day!* Please note that SuperTank Pro should be charged from the solar panel’s USB output using an A-to-C cable, not from a DC-to-USB converter.Many electric cars and bikes feature charging ports that work especially well with SuperTank Pro, so you can charge on the way to your destination. We found that the USB-C ports on the Tesla Model 3 can charge SuperTank Pro at up to 27W. Surprising, huh?

<li>One paper for <strong>all weather</strong>. Will survive sweat, rain, mud, snow, oil, grease, and the wear-and-tear of daily use.</li>
<li>
<strong> Use anything</strong> like a pen, even your keys. You can use several means to write on stone paper in case there is no pen on hand.</li>
<li>The combination of titanium alloy with stone paper has a flame retardant effect, especially in its closed state.

The titanium cover is <strong>fire-resistant</strong> and will <strong>protect the notes within.</strong>

Today, we are excited to reveal the refreshed version of the notepad that put us on the map.We stuck with it and showed that we commit to not only get the product out but also to refine its design and make it the product we wanted it to be. We listened to the needs of our customers and created the Nanobook 2.0, a product that is even more convenient to use than the original. FIRE RESISTANT100% WATERPROOFSUPER DURABILITY Here is Nanobook 2.0 in a nutshell: 
Designed to be small enough to fit comfortably in your hand when you’re outdoors.
Made from stone & grade 5 titanium, this next-generation product is made from non-organic materials and zero trees were harmed in its production.
One paper for all weather. Will survive sweat, rain, mud, snow, oil, grease, and the wear-and-tear of daily use.

 Use anything like a pen, even your keys. You can use several means to write on stone paper in case there is no pen on hand.
The combination of titanium alloy with stone paper has a flame retardant effect, especially in its closed state. The stone paper alone will eventually burn, but compared with other paper, it is more resilient. The titanium cover is fire-resistant and will protect the notes within.

 Our robust and waterproof stone-paper goes hand in hand with the new and durable Grade 5 Titanium Cover. Whether it’s spilt coffee or just every-day wear, the legendary strength of the feather-light Titanium in a Nanobook 2.0 can withstand all of the obstacles that life throws at you.Stone Paper is a revolutionary new medium whose composition is owed more to stone than organic material. Its production process creates a product which is 100% tree-free, water-free, acid-free, bleach-free and does not produce any waste. Nanobook is small enough that it can be grasped in one hand, meaning that it can be used in all circumstances, regardless of what Mother Nature throws in your path. It can cope with all kinds of writing outdoors, even when you don’t have access to a table or another platform to write on. We made it our mission to create a notepad that you can carry and write on, wherever you are.  IN HANDIN POCKET​ Nanobook has a tremendous feature: it can be written on with coins, most keys and even using the tip of a bullet. This means you can easily and quickly take your essential notes in a tight spot, even when you don’t have access to a pen. ANY PENEVEN COINS The refillable system is perfectly designed so that you can be fully present.

Semiconductors (electronic components that make many wonderful things possible) are typically made with silicon. But in some applications, GaN (Gallium Nitride) has proven to be superior. In power converters, GaN semiconductors operate at a higher efficiency. This means they generate less heat when performing a task, which means engineers don’t have to dedicate as much space to managing that heat. The result? A smaller product with more power and less heat.

We’ve followed up with two other products: Passport Pro and Passport 30W. Thousands of Passport devices have been shipped around the world, thanks to the support of our backers. Our fourth installment marks a bigger leap than we’ve ever taken before. Introducing Passport II Pro. Passport II Pro is more than just a travel adapter. It is an indispensable powerhouse for home use as well.       It only takes 2 hours to fully charge a 13” MacBook Pro. Leave your laptop charger at home. With Passport II Pro and a USB-C to USB-C cable, you’re packing lighter and smarter than ever before. Plus, Passport II Pro has enough ports to charge up to five other devices.  The 61W USB-C PD port isn’t just for laptops. It supports mainstream fast charge protocols like PD, QC, PPS 3A, AFC and FCP for fast charging Apple, Samsung, HUAWEI and more. iPhone 11 Pro can be charged up to 50% in 30 minutes with PD 3.0, and Samsung Galaxy S20 can be fully charged in just one hour with PPS 3A.Thanks to cutting-edge GaN technology and several long meetings with engineers, we don’t have to make choice between performance and size. Passport II Pro is 20% smaller than Passport 30W, despite delivering over twice the power and having more ports. It’s like having your cake and eating it too… and then charging your laptop with the cake.So what is GaN? Semiconductors (electronic components that make many wonderful things possible) are typically made with silicon. But in some applications, GaN (Gallium Nitride) has proven to be superior. In power converters, GaN semiconductors operate at a higher efficiency. This means they generate less heat when performing a task, which means engineers don’t have to dedicate as much space to managing that heat. The result? A smaller product with more power and less heat. The future’s so bright and small, you’ll need prescription shades to see it.Passport II Pro is equipped with 5 USB ports (2 USB-C ports & 3 USB-A ports) and a multi-region AC outlet, allowing you to charge up to 6 devices at the same time. No need to carry several different chargers for all your devices. Keep your desk neat and clutter-free with Passport II Pro.Passport II Pro’s sleekness and versatility really shine when it’s time to hit the road. You’ll have so much extra space in your bag, you might hear an echo. Passport II Pro integrates US, UK, EU & AU plug into one sleek unit. Passport II Pro can plug into type A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N and O outlets. This is related to where you want to travel with Passport II Pro.  Passport II Pro can accept type A, B, C, E, F, G, I, J, L and N plugs. This is related to the devices you want to use, or in other words, where you are from. Here is a complete list of countries & regions that Passport II Pro is compatible with (more than 200 countries and regions).The retractable plugs are integrated into Passport II Pro’s all-in-one design and can be accessed with one hand using the Press & Slide controls. The sliding action is smoother than ever, for ease of use and a better user experience.  But wait, where is AU plug?Just rotate the US plug and you will get an AU plug. Pretty easy, right?And it won't interfere with the switch button in Australia & New Zealand! We introduced auto-resetting fuses to the travel adapter industry with our first Passport. In the event that you plug something into your travel adapter that draws too much current, the fuse will stop the flow of power. Most travel adapters on the market have a single-use fuse that you’ll have to replace if this happens. Passport’s auto-resetting fuse means you’re back in action within about a minute. And with Passport II Pro, the fuse has been upgraded to 10A, which means Passport II Pro is compatible with many high-power devices that other travel adapters can’t handle, including many brands of hair dryers, hair straighteners, and electric kettles.Safety always comes first. Passport II Pro adopts a child-proof shield to make sure that the AC outlet is only used for plugs… in case a curious toddler tries to stick anything else in there.Passport II Pro follows the design language of Passport, the one which won Good Design Award in 2017 from the Chicago Athenaeum Museum of Architecture and Design. The “Press and Slide” buttons and Roman Pillars Stripe design make Passport II Pro stand out from other travel adapters.  Zendure was founded in 2013 by Tom Haflinger and Bryan Liu.

You deserve a better monitor. A far better OLED monitor. OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode) displays are better than LCDs…they are brighter, more efficient, have better contrast and refresh rates, and are thinner in size.However, the OLED monitors currently on the market are either too expensive or unsuitable for on-the-go use.   Introducing XtendTouch Pro, the world’s first 15.6-inch 4K AMOLED portable monitor, with true-to-life colors, extreme blacks, and stunning details that let you see and work better.  
 
Hands-on Review by ETA PRIME ""This is by far the best looking portable monitor I have ever tested and it actually the best looking display that I have here at the house out of all my Monitors and TVs! This thing is absolutely beautiful.Filming this monitor with the camera isn't going to do it justice. The best way to see how good this looks is with the naked eyes. But I still think this came out absolutely amazing.""

 

Hands-on Review by TheRelaxingEnd ""The response time seems better than in some of the other portable monitors I've tried...""

 
 
 There are over 8.3 million self-lit pixels in the XtendTouch Pro 4K AMOLED display, each emits their own light independently and can be completely turned off. Therefore, the XtendTouch Pro enables everyone to enjoy an unparalleled viewing experience, with vivid colors, deep black, stunning images, and incredible details.  
 
    Wider color gamut XtendTouch Pro exceeds industry standards for color reproduction, achieving over 100% DCI-P3 color gamut coverage.  Truly-precise color accuracy, exceptional contrast, and rapid response.  

  
 High quality displays are of vital importance to many professionals like video editors, photographers, designers, colorists, and anyone chasing superior quality to see the true colors, contrast, and details of their content. XtendTouch Pro is your creative studio on-the-go that gives you everything you need to boost creativity and productivity.  
 With an advanced stylus included, drawing, image retouching, and note-taking have never been so easy. Intuitive, precise, and 4096-pressure-sensitive, it is magical with a Microsoft-certified chip and is always ready when inspiration strikes.  

 
 XtendTouch Pro is equipped with multiple ports that allow connection to virtually any device. Whether you are using the display with a laptop, smartphone, or even Switch for gaming, XtendTouch Pro meets all your daily demands.  
 
  Reliable power supply system The cutting-edge power supply system ensures stable operation at high-brightness. In contrast, typical monitors will turn dark without sufficient power or can’t reach high-brightness at all.  
Foldable stand & Magnetic cover for various angles & uses Every XtendTouch Pro comes with a foldable stand and magnetic cover that can unlock endless viewing possibilities. The stand is designed with pros in mind and is completely adjustable, allowing your XtendTouch Pro to fit seamlessly into any work environment. The magnetic cover provides great protection while using in both landscape and portrait mode (auto-rotation via gyroscope).  
 PD Passthrough Charging This function enables you to charge your devices via XtendTouch Pro itself, to keep you powered up at all times and eliminates the need to carry extra chargers. Set up is hassle-free and plug & play, so you get more done quickly.  Hardware Low Blue Light Filter TechnologyThe AMOLED display panel of the XtendTouch Pro has a native hardware blue light filter that shifts the frequencies of the harmful blue light spectrum to the beneficial spectrum and thus effectively reducing damage to the eye while maintaining its picture quality. It's with up to 70% less blue light emission than an LCD monitor.  
Dual Stereo Speakers Typical portable monitors always seem to have poor sound quality. We armed XtendTouch Pro with dual stereo speakers that deliver outstanding audio and dynamic bass for crystal clear sound for any application.  
Picture in picture When connecting 2 devices to XtendTouch at the same time, you can still view both of them. Watch a movie while making a video call, or take notes while having a Zoom online meeting, it’s up to you.  
 XtendTouch Pro perfectly combines outstanding performance and an affordable price, making it the ideal portable monitor for any on-the-go creative, student, or digital nomad.

</div><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Compatibility: Android, Windows Phone, Ubuntu</h3><p>Contrary to the old classic PC market, <strong>there is no video protocol standard on Smartphone</strong>. To better understand the choice we had to make, let's have a look at the different options to display a Smartphone's on an external screen:</p><p><strong>MHL over USB C:</strong> It's a hardware solution founded by both Samsung and Sony. The problem is that it's now present almost only on Sony products because Samsung has switched to SlimPort.</p><p><strong>HDMI over USB C:</strong> It's hardware solution but is currently present in no device at all.</p><p><strong>DisplayLink:</strong> It's a software solution enabling all smartphones to be compatible because you need to install a driver over an app. However, the software compression makes that technology unstable and uses significantly the CPU processing power.</p><p><strong>SlimPort:</strong> This is the native technology we chose. It's a Hardware solution,which implies that it's very reliable, efficient and and it's the most frequently integrated in Mobile devices. Samsung, LG, Microsoft, Acer, HTC are all using Slimport on their smartphones. Apple is also secretly using this technology in their Iphones, but it's not used at the moment.</p><p><strong>Miracast:</strong> This is a wireless solution, and we really hope to use it one day, even though this may incur higher production costs.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1492686201/axdpru2de9zztxn1rmrq.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><u><strong>The Mirabook:</strong></u> We had to make a choice in terms of compatibility and that's why the Mirabook prioritizes the performance over universal compatibility. However, we have the possibility to develop a special cable/adapter working with DisplayLink to reach more Smartphones models, Once the $100K threshold is reached The same will be done for a wireless dongle if we meet our goal of $1,5M.</p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">They talk about Miraxess</h3><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1492089675/tcoguajqliuctqs1hm56.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1492080868/k22hth3tq8yl5ovbxodd.jpg"" src=""""/></h3><div>

DisplayPort™ is the best A/V protocol to be carried over USB Type-C.</p><h3>What happens if I receive a call when my phone is plugged to the Mirabook ?</h3><p>You will be able to pick up the call directly on your mobile phone and on the Mirabook as well.</p><h3>Does the screen of the mirabook stay on when my phone is locked ?</h3><p>It will depend on the OS you are running. For example, with Windows continuum or Samsung Desktop Experience, this function is  included.</p><h3>How do I check the battery level ?</h3><p>You can press the battery level gauge button on the side to see it.</p><h3>Will there be different keyboard layout ?</h3><p>We really want to have international keyboard layouts, but it will depend upon quantity required. We invite you to share the campaign page to your friend so we can reach the minimum order quantity for your keyboard. At first, the QWERTY keyboard will be available.</p><h3>Can I change the brightness of the screen or adjust audio level by using hotkey?</h3><p>Yes</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">_____________________________________________________________________________________</p><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">

</div><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Compatibilidad : Android, Windows Phone, Ubuntu</strong></h3><p>A diferencia del mercado de los PC tradicionales, no hay ningún protocolo de video estándar en el smartphone. De todas las diferentes opciones disponibles, Miraxess eligió optar por un protocolo del Smartphone a una pantalla externa a través de la tecnología de SlimPort. La razón es la siguiente: </p><p>La interfaz USB MHL-C (interfaz de alta definición móvil) es una solución desarrollada por Samsung y Sony. El problema con esta interfaz es que ahora está presente en productos diseñados por Sony, pero no por Samsung, este último pasa por una tecnología SlimPort. </p><p>HDMI USB-C sería una solución de hardware viable, pero por desgracia, no es presente en los smartphones necesarios.</p><p><strong>DisplayLink </strong>es una solución de software que garantiza la compatibilidad de los smartphones mediante la instalación de un controlador a través de una aplicación dedicada. Sin embargo, el compresor del software hace que sea instable y muy hambrienta en materia de poder de procesador. </p><p><strong>SlimPort</strong> es la tecnología que tenemos privilegiada. Esta es una solución de hardware, por lo que es confiable, eficiente, y que hace que sea una solución integrada con frecuencia en los smartphones. Samsung, LG, Microsoft, Acer, HTC son todas marcas que utilizan SlimPort en sus smartphones. Apple también ha utilizado esta solucion en silencio, sin que esta sea muy util por el momento.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Miracast </strong>es una solución inalámbrica que deseamos utilizar en el futuro, a pesar de que los precios de produccion aumenten.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1492614182/jfa3rtnzshcczvzhfwvw.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>El desarrollo de Mirabook nos obligó a tomar decisiones, y es por eso que decidimos centrarnos en el rendimiento más que una compatibilidad universal. Sin embargo, nuestra financiación del proyecto - una vez los $100 000 pasados - incluye el posible desarrollo de un adaptador compatible con la tecnología DisplayLink para que nuestro Mirabook sea accesible a un número cada vez mayor de smartphones. Y una vez que cruzemos los 1,5 millones, el desarrollo de una llave inalámbrica estará al orden del día.</p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Hablan de nosotros</strong></h3><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1492089675/tcoguajqliuctqs1hm56.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1492080868/k22hth3tq8yl5ovbxodd.jpg"" src=""""/></h3><div>

La convergencia móvil es una solución que nos permite hacer dos cosas a la vez: mediante el desarrollo de productos innovadores, también le simplificamos la vida. Por su visión innovadora de la informática y un nuevo enfoque de la movilidad, Miraxess quiere crear una nueva historia con el Smartphone.

Compatibility: Android, Windows Phone, UbuntuContrary to the old classic PC market, there is no video protocol standard on Smartphone. To better understand the choice we had to make, let's have a look at the different options to display a Smartphone's on an external screen:MHL over USB C: It's a hardware solution founded by both Samsung and Sony. The problem is that it's now present almost only on Sony products because Samsung has switched to SlimPort.HDMI over USB C: It's hardware solution but is currently present in no device at all.DisplayLink: It's a software solution enabling all smartphones to be compatible because you need to install a driver over an app. However, the software compression makes that technology unstable and uses significantly the CPU processing power.SlimPort: This is the native technology we chose. It's a Hardware solution,which implies that it's very reliable, efficient and and it's the most frequently integrated in Mobile devices. Samsung, LG, Microsoft, Acer, HTC are all using Slimport on their smartphones. Apple is also secretly using this technology in their Iphones, but it's not used at the moment.Miracast: This is a wireless solution, and we really hope to use it one day, even though this may incur higher production costs. The Mirabook: We had to make a choice in terms of compatibility and that's why the Mirabook prioritizes the performance over universal compatibility. However, we have the possibility to develop a special cable/adapter working with DisplayLink to reach more Smartphones models, Once the $100K threshold is reached The same will be done for a wireless dongle if we meet our goal of $1,5M.They talk about Miraxess


 
About Miraxess It started with a simple question: ""Why do we have so many devices when having only one would be enough."" Mobile convergence is the solution to develop innovative products and make life more simple. Miraxess wishes to mark its time with an innovative vision of computing and a new approach to mobility. The young French start-up was founded in 2015 by Yanis Anteur (CEO) and Paul-Emile René (CTO), then joined by Julien Guillaud (Business dev Associate) and Fabien Pointet (CMO).


 Our visionThe Mirabook is just a start, and we anticipate the coming of the Mobile First Revolution. Your Smartphone has so much potential that it becomes the only meaningful computer. We predict that, in the future your Smartphone will be your main internet access point. It will be the client of a connected cloud server for your deported Operating system, your professional software, and your data.Based on this vision, Miraxess is a creator of Smartphone extensions and there are so many revolutionary products we want to launch, such as a tablet extension, a dock or a gaming station, all working with your Smartphone.The future is mobile and the only computer your need is in your pocket. Where do you ship to?Our shipping partner uses multiple couriers for worldwide delivery and we will ship to any place where they deliver.Is shipping included?Unfortunately, Shipping is not included, as we are still currently engaged in talks with 3PL (third-party logistic) companies to provide you the best price. We are building a custom portal for you to keep track of your Mirabook . Once the campaign is finished you will receive a personal login to www.miraxess.com and pay for your shipping there. Approximate shipping cost will be $15 anywhere in Europe, and the USA. Shipping-related costs to other countries will vary depending on your location.Purchasers are responsible for any VAT or customs duties levied by their own countries.What are the possible issues and challenges?The Mirabook is nearly complete. The final prototypes shown on this page and in the videos were built on our partner ODM's production line. We’ve done our very best to forecast demand and create a solid production plan and we are ready to meet the estimated delivery times. However, component delays and unexpected shortages can occur and sometimes forecasts don’t always hit the mark. If this happens, we’ll let you know why and make it right as quickly as possibleWhat are the phone specification requirement to use the mirabook ?The phone must support DisplayPort over USB Type-C(see the list of compatible phones or ask your manufacturer)We plan to develop an adapter to convert DisplayLink to DisplayPort for phones without DisplayPort support.What is DisplayPort™ over USB Type-C?DisplayPort™ over USB Type-C enables the delivery of full DisplayPort A/V performance (driving monitor resolutions of 4K and beyond), SuperSpeed USB (USB 3.1) data and up to 100 watts of power with the convenience of reversible plug orientation and cable direction. DisplayPort™ is the best A/V protocol to be carried over USB Type-C.What happens if I receive a call when my phone is plugged to the Mirabook ?You will be able to pick up the call directly on your mobile phone and on the Mirabook as well.Does the screen of the mirabook stay on when my phone is locked ?It will depend on the OS you are running. For example, with Windows continuum or Samsung Desktop Experience, this function is  included.How do I check the battery level ?You can press the battery level gauge button on the side to see it.Will there be different keyboard layout ?We really want to have international keyboard layouts, but it will depend upon quantity required. We invite you to share the campaign page to your friend so we can reach the minimum order quantity for your keyboard. At first, the QWERTY keyboard will be available.Can I change the brightness of the screen or adjust audio level by using hotkey?Yes_____________________________________________________________________________________

Compatibilité : Android, Windows Phone, UbuntuContrairement au marché PC traditionnel, il n’existe pas de protocole vidéo standard sur smartphone. De toutes les différentes options qui s’offraient à nous, Miraxess a fait le choix d’opter pour un affichage d’écran de smartphone sur un écran externe grâce à la technologie SlimPort. Voici pourquoi : L’interface MHL via USB-C (interface mobile de haute définition) est une solution développée par Samsung et Sony. Le problème de cette interface est qu’elle est désormais présente sur les produits conçus par Sony mais pas par Samsung, ces derniers étant passés à une technologie SlimPort. L’HDMI via USB-C serait une solution hardware viable mais qui n’est malheureusement pas présente sur les appareils requis.DisplayLink est une solution logicielle assurant la compatibilité des smartphones grâce à l’installation d’un pilote via une application dédiée. Cependant, la compression du logiciel rend cette technologie instable et gourmande en matière de puissance de processeur. SlimPort est la technologie native que nous avons privilégiée. C’est une solution hardware, ce qui la rend fiable, efficace, et qui fait d’elle une solution fréquemment intégrée aux smartphones. Samsung, LG, Microsoft, Acer, HTC sont autant de marques utilisant SlimPort pour leurs smartphones. Apple y a également discrètement recours, sans que ce choix soit pour le moment ouvertement utile. Miracast est une solution sans fil que souhaitons pouvoir utiliser à l’avenir, et ce bien qu’elle entraîne des coûts de production accrus. Le développement du Mirabook nous a contraint à faire des choix, et c’est pourquoi nous avons décidé de privilégier la performance plutôt qu’une compatibilité universelle. Toutefois, notre projet de financement – une fois le cap des 100 000 dollars franchi - inclut le développement éventuel d’un adaptateur compatible avec la technologie DisplayLink pour rendre notre Mirabook accessible à un nombre croissant de smartphones. Et une fois le cap des 1,5 millions franchi, c’est cette fois-ci le développement d’un dongle sans fil qui sera à l’ordre du jour.Ils parlent de nous


 
About Miraxess Tout a commencé avec une simple question. Pourquoi s’embarrasser d’une multitude d’appareils alors qu’un seul suffirait ? La convergence mobile est une solution qui nous permet de faire d’une pierre deux coups : en développant des produits innovants, nous nous simplifions également la vie. Par sa vision novatrice de l’informatique et par une nouvelle approche de la mobilité, Miraxess souhaite marquer l’histoire du smartphone de son empreinte. La jeune start-up a été fondée en 2015 par Yanis Anteur (PDG) et Paul-Émile René (Directeur de la technologie), rejoints plus tard par Julien Guillaud (Directeur Commercial) et Fabien Pointet (Directeur Marketing).

Nous développons actuellement un service de suivi qui vous permettra de suivre en temps réel la livraison de votre Mirabook.Dès la fin de la levée de fonds, vous recevrez un identifiant qui vous permettra de vous connecter sur la page www.miraxess.com et de payer vos frais de port directement sur celle-ci. Nos frais de port s’élèvent en moyenne à 15 dollars pour une livraison en Europe ou aux États-Unis. Un autre montant s’appliquera en dehors de cette zone et selon le pays de destination.L’application éventuelle d’une TVA ou de frais de douane selon le pays de destination seront toutes deux à la charge de l’acheteur.Vais-je rencontrer d’éventuels problèmes ou difficultés ?Le Mirabook est entré dans sa phase finale de développement. Les prototypes présentés sur cette page et sur ces vidéos ont été conçus via la chaîne de production de notre original design manufacturer (ODM).

DisplayPort allie la rapidité du service USB SuperSpeed (USB 3.1) à une puissance de 100 watts, tout en offrant tout le confort d’une prise et d’un câble orientables à souhait. DisplayPort est à ce jour le meilleur protocole audio/ vidéo disponible via USB-C.Que se passe-t-il si je reçois un appel sur mon smartphone pendant que j’utilise le Mirabook ?Vous aurez le choix de décrocher directement sur votre smartphone ou depuis le Mirabook.L’écran du Mirabook restera-t-il allumé si je verrouille mon smartphone ?Tout dépend de votre système d’exploitation. Cela sera possible avec, entre autres, Windows Continuum et Samsung Desktop Experience car ils assurent notamment ce service.Comment puis-je vérifier le niveau de charge de la batterie ?Le Mirabook vous permet de vérifier à tout moment quel est votre niveau de charge restant grâce à un bouton dédié, sur le côté.Aurais-je une disposition de touches de clavier différente en passant sur le Mirabook ?Assurer la disponibilité des claviers les plus internationalement répandus est au cœur de nos préoccupations. Nous vous invitons à partager notre page de campagne avec vos amis pour atteindre le palier de commandes qui déclenchera la disponibilité de votre Mirabook avec la disposition de clavier de votre choix. Pour le moment, seul le clavier QWERTY est disponible. Le Mirabook sera-t-il équipé d’une touche permettant de régler la luminosité ou le niveau de volume ?Oui._____________________________________________________________________________________Convierte tu teléfono en un ordenador portátil!En un mundo donde prevalecen todos los móviles, Miraxess se enorgullece en presentar el Mirabook, una extensión que le permite convertir tu teléfono en un ordenador real.

Compatibilidad : Android, Windows Phone, UbuntuA diferencia del mercado de los PC tradicionales, no hay ningún protocolo de video estándar en el smartphone. De todas las diferentes opciones disponibles, Miraxess eligió optar por un protocolo del Smartphone a una pantalla externa a través de la tecnología de SlimPort. La razón es la siguiente: La interfaz USB MHL-C (interfaz de alta definición móvil) es una solución desarrollada por Samsung y Sony. El problema con esta interfaz es que ahora está presente en productos diseñados por Sony, pero no por Samsung, este último pasa por una tecnología SlimPort. HDMI USB-C sería una solución de hardware viable, pero por desgracia, no es presente en los smartphones necesarios.DisplayLink es una solución de software que garantiza la compatibilidad de los smartphones mediante la instalación de un controlador a través de una aplicación dedicada. Sin embargo, el compresor del software hace que sea instable y muy hambrienta en materia de poder de procesador. SlimPort es la tecnología que tenemos privilegiada. Esta es una solución de hardware, por lo que es confiable, eficiente, y que hace que sea una solución integrada con frecuencia en los smartphones. Samsung, LG, Microsoft, Acer, HTC son todas marcas que utilizan SlimPort en sus smartphones. Apple también ha utilizado esta solucion en silencio, sin que esta sea muy util por el momento. Miracast es una solución inalámbrica que deseamos utilizar en el futuro, a pesar de que los precios de produccion aumenten. El desarrollo de Mirabook nos obligó a tomar decisiones, y es por eso que decidimos centrarnos en el rendimiento más que una compatibilidad universal. Sin embargo, nuestra financiación del proyecto - una vez los $100 000 pasados - incluye el posible desarrollo de un adaptador compatible con la tecnología DisplayLink para que nuestro Mirabook sea accesible a un número cada vez mayor de smartphones. Y una vez que cruzemos los 1,5 millones, el desarrollo de una llave inalámbrica estará al orden del día.Hablan de nosotros

Compatibilidade : Android, Windows Phone, UbuntuAo contrário do mercado de PCs tradicionais, não há nenhum protocolo de vídeo padrão no smartphone. De todas as diferentes opções disponíveis, Miraxess escolheu optar por um protocolo de Smartphone a um monitor externo via tecnologia SlimPort.They talk about Miraxess


Sobre Miraxess Tudo começou com uma pergunta simple. Por que se preocupar com uma infinidade de dispositivos quando apenas um seria suficiente? Convergência móvel é uma solução que nos permite fazer duas coisas ao mesmo tempo: através do desenvolvimento de produtos inovadores também simplificar a sua vida. Por sua visão inovadora da computação e uma nova abordagem para a mobilidade, Miraxess quer criar uma nova história com o Smartphone. A jovem Start-Up foi fundada em 2015 por Yanis Anteur (CEO) e Paul-Émile René (CTO), mais tarde juntou Julien Guillaud (Diretor Comercial) e Fabien Pointet (CMO).


 Nosa visãoMirabook é apenas o começo, porque com a chegada iminente da primeira revolução móvel, estamos confiantes de que em breve veremos o nascimento de uma nova era.

<p>Hi Indiegogo, my name is Erin Walker. I am a family man, entrepreneur, and Jesus follower.<br/>Here is my Bible for Creatives story.</p>
<p>One early morning in December 2019 (around Christmas time) I was doing Bible study on my iPad. I was feeling frustrated by the creative limitations and options of the current Bible apps available (there are some great apps and they do many things really well, but you can't draw, write or be creative in any way).<br/>I love the iPad and use the Apple Pencil, but for Bible study on the iPad, it is nothing more than a highlighter. Plus the kids kept on taking my notebooks and pencil off the table so it was always a search for the pens and supplies before Bibel Study time.<br/>As a parent, we have little free time so we need to make every second count.  <br/>I myself am an intermediate designer at best, but I always had a passion for designing and being creative. This was my final ""aha"" moment. An idea was born. </p>
<p>I had this idea (I believe it was a divine inspiration) for a Bible app, unlike all the other Bible apps.<br/>I wanted to create a Bible app with a full creative suite of tools and enough white space for creative freedom and to journal to your heart's content. All you need is an iPad and a stylus (like the Apple Pencil). </p>
<p>For the next five months, we worked with an amazing design company to create the most minimal and cleanest Bible app ever, with the right tools to give you full creative authority with your Bible. On the iPad. This is the Bible for Creatives app.</p>
<p>We have an amazing minimal viable product and need your help to raise $8000 for the developers to complete coding the app for the iPad. It is that simple.<br/>This product is as much for me as it is for a large community of creative Bible readers who want more from their electronic Bible.<br/>Please support us and be part of something special.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1594825161/vat34vlbwzdcan5kyin0.png"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1593667882/ls0odqc6jgqwpv5t38ui.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>There are many Bible apps on the market. There is no app like the Bible for creatives though. The Bible for creatives solves two distinct problems:</p>
<p>Regular Bible journalers and creative people have a genuine lack of mobility when it comes to Bible journaling and being creative on their regular Bible. Just ask my wife :) When the kids want to play outside you can't take all your creative tools along with you. It's just too much of a hassle.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/UuI1e4eAmnhdfk2lPs/giphy.gif"" src=""""/> </p>
<p>The Bible for Creatives iPad app brings great design, simplicity, and mobility to Bible journaling on the iPad.</p>
<p>The other problem we want to solve is for a group of regular Bible readers who use their iPad Bible for normal day to day Bible reading. This second group of people is frustrated with the lack of creativity and note-taking options on current Bible apps. Here the Bible for Creatives comes in very handy.</p>
<p> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/XEUculhygyzxDQipsA/giphy.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Not sure what Bible journaling is? Nathan from Lifeway.com explains it perfectly:<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1597349431/i5wzep3zj6ritu7dggtu.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>""Bible journaling is an exciting way to engage with Scripture. It can transform the way you spend time in the Word and it all begins within the margins of the Bible. With Bible journaling, you will find a creative and fresh approach to the age-old discipline of Bible reading. With pen in hand, you can visually capture Scripture, meditate on God's Word, and memorize the text. Some choose to journal as an expression of private devotion, others journal as an act of worship and there are even some who consider it a creative outlet that can be shared.  No matter what your purpose for Bible journaling, the beauty of the movement is this: it doesn’t require a skilled artist. All that matters is that you’re willing to experience God and His Word in a creative way.""</p>

<p>Reading the Bible is not just about how many chapters you read per day (quantity) but also how much time you spent on a few scriptures (quality). The more you focus and meditate on a few scriptures a day the better you understand, remember, and grasp the depth of God's word.<br/>The Bible for Creatives helps with this as you spent more time analyzing and understanding every word when you pair it with our suite of creative tools.</p>

<p>The Bible for Creatives is not like any other Bible app you have experienced before. We designed this app from the ground up starting with a simple blank wireframe.  Then we added the functions we needed for the perfect Bible app one by one. Simplicity was an important theme. That and enough white space to apply your art, notes and creativity in the space around and next to scriptures. We needed to do this without loosing any of the normal experience of reading and accessing scriptures in your favourite translations. Everything had to be excellent and world class. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1594825161/etsaaxqg94o3tetbhe8o.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p>The Bible for Creatives is so simple to use! You can customize your Bible design by folowing a few simple steps. The first thing you can do when you create a new Bible with our app is to choose the amount of white space you need that suites you're creative needs.</p>
<p>This starts with the amount of drawing space (the space between the border and the text). Also choose if you like your text to be in centre or either side. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1594216659/xiy5z8c3iikdqsztbbbk.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Then you choose the amount of line space you want between each line of text. The more the line space - the more you can write and draw.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1594216692/ngiavxmgytfzyqhi2oxt.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Once you are happy with the drawing and line spacing choose your favourite font and font size.</p>

<p>We believe the Bible for Creatives will benefit any Christian who wants to delve deeper into God's word. Everyone experiences reading the Bible differently as everyone is uniquely made. The Bible for Creatives just makes it easier to be yourself when studying the Bible. Even if you just highlight and write small notes (you don't have to be an illustrator) this app makes it possible! This is the thing that makes us really excited. We want everyone to experience God on a deeper level. </p>

<p>The thing with risks is if you don’t ever take one, you’ll never know what could have been. This project is certainly a risk in regard to our time and energy, but we believe it’s one well-worth taking. We have already sorted large part of the design, concept, translations, and kinks because this is a project we are very passionate about. If we don’t meet our minimum raise our backers will not be charged and it will be next-to-impossible to launch in 2020. We would then seek alternative financing and launch as soon as 2021.</p>

<p>The challenges surrounding any project like this are always larger than originally perceived. We want to deliver a high-quality award-winning application that will change Christian's lives and make Bible study even more enjoyable. Because our team is small we don’t have access to unlimited resources to pour into this project, so setbacks are possible. From API and OS changes to late-surfacing bugs and the complexities of managing many Bible translations, patience may be required :)</p>

</div></div>","Do you feel inspired by the Bible and love creating art and journaling inside it? Do you wish you could do more than highlighting when reading the Bible on your iPad?Now you can!
The Bible for Creatives iPadOS App gives you full creative access to your own personal Bible.Take your Bible everywhere you go and create art, let your creativity flow with journaling, or just make notes. All you need is an iPad and a stylus like the Apple pencil - and the Bible for Creatives app.


This is the Bible for Creatives!
 

Hi Indiegogo, my name is Erin Walker. I am a family man, entrepreneur, and Jesus follower.Here is my Bible for Creatives story.
One early morning in December 2019 (around Christmas time) I was doing Bible study on my iPad. I was feeling frustrated by the creative limitations and options of the current Bible apps available (there are some great apps and they do many things really well, but you can't draw, write or be creative in any way).I love the iPad and use the Apple Pencil, but for Bible study on the iPad, it is nothing more than a highlighter. Plus the kids kept on taking my notebooks and pencil off the table so it was always a search for the pens and supplies before Bibel Study time.As a parent, we have little free time so we need to make every second count.  I myself am an intermediate designer at best, but I always had a passion for designing and being creative. This was my final ""aha"" moment. An idea was born. 
I had this idea (I believe it was a divine inspiration) for a Bible app, unlike all the other Bible apps.I wanted to create a Bible app with a full creative suite of tools and enough white space for creative freedom and to journal to your heart's content. All you need is an iPad and a stylus (like the Apple Pencil). 
For the next five months, we worked with an amazing design company to create the most minimal and cleanest Bible app ever, with the right tools to give you full creative authority with your Bible. On the iPad. This is the Bible for Creatives app.
We have an amazing minimal viable product and need your help to raise $8000 for the developers to complete coding the app for the iPad. It is that simple.This product is as much for me as it is for a large community of creative Bible readers who want more from their electronic Bible.Please support us and be part of something special.
There are many Bible apps on the market. There is no app like the Bible for creatives though. The Bible for creatives solves two distinct problems:
Regular Bible journalers and creative people have a genuine lack of mobility when it comes to Bible journaling and being creative on their regular Bible. Just ask my wife :) When the kids want to play outside you can't take all your creative tools along with you. It's just too much of a hassle.
 
The Bible for Creatives iPad app brings great design, simplicity, and mobility to Bible journaling on the iPad.
The other problem we want to solve is for a group of regular Bible readers who use their iPad Bible for normal day to day Bible reading. This second group of people is frustrated with the lack of creativity and note-taking options on current Bible apps. Here the Bible for Creatives comes in very handy.
 
Not sure what Bible journaling is? Nathan from Lifeway.com explains it perfectly:
""Bible journaling is an exciting way to engage with Scripture. It can transform the way you spend time in the Word and it all begins within the margins of the Bible. With Bible journaling, you will find a creative and fresh approach to the age-old discipline of Bible reading. With pen in hand, you can visually capture Scripture, meditate on God's Word, and memorize the text. Some choose to journal as an expression of private devotion, others journal as an act of worship and there are even some who consider it a creative outlet that can be shared.  No matter what your purpose for Bible journaling, the beauty of the movement is this: it doesn’t require a skilled artist. All that matters is that you’re willing to experience God and His Word in a creative way.""

 

We want to give people full creative access & freedom to their Bibles - on a simple mobile solution. 

Reading the Bible is not just about how many chapters you read per day (quantity) but also how much time you spent on a few scriptures (quality). The more you focus and meditate on a few scriptures a day the better you understand, remember, and grasp the depth of God's word.The Bible for Creatives helps with this as you spent more time analyzing and understanding every word when you pair it with our suite of creative tools.
 
 

The Bible for Creatives is not like any other Bible app you have experienced before. We designed this app from the ground up starting with a simple blank wireframe.  Then we added the functions we needed for the perfect Bible app one by one. Simplicity was an important theme. That and enough white space to apply your art, notes and creativity in the space around and next to scriptures. We needed to do this without loosing any of the normal experience of reading and accessing scriptures in your favourite translations. Everything had to be excellent and world class. 
 

The Bible for Creatives is so simple to use! You can customize your Bible design by folowing a few simple steps. The first thing you can do when you create a new Bible with our app is to choose the amount of white space you need that suites you're creative needs.
This starts with the amount of drawing space (the space between the border and the text). Also choose if you like your text to be in centre or either side. 

Then you choose the amount of line space you want between each line of text. The more the line space - the more you can write and draw.

Once you are happy with the drawing and line spacing choose your favourite font and font size.

The font size also influences how much usable white space you have.

Do you like to read vertically with endless scrolling or more like a traditional book? Select an option!

We designed the app with an industrial dark mode and elegant light mode - whatever suits your style.


Finally, choose your favourite translation (We are working on adding all the translations available).

Now, you are ready to draw, write, paint, highlight, and do almost whatever you want. Your imagination is the only limit.

We included extra art tools like shapes, a ruler, cut & paste options as well as importing images.

If you need support lines, choose between different backgrounds including grid, lines, and dots.

Another cool feature is you can save any verse to customized folders for prayers, declarations or simply studying them later on. It's so simple.

 
You can create as many Bibles as you want with each customized to your liking.
Instagram much? Easily share any section on-screen to social media.

Double-tap your pencil and activate the read-only mode. Distraction-free reading with minimal clutter and normal functions like copying & pasting verses. 

As with all Bible apps, you can search for keywords anywhere in the Bible including your notes.

The Bible for Creatives has a ton of customizations to find you're perfect white space match :)

You see! That was super easy.

We are actively refining the Bible for Creatives design with new innovations. As our community grows we will use your feedback to make the app even better. We know we could never make the perfect app, but we strive to come as close as possible :)
See our planned timeline below:
 


Our initial target is an $8000 minimum to complete development of the app. The funds will go 100% into the development & coding of the app for iPadOS. 
If we do not reach our humble target of $8000 we will have to seek other forms of finance to complete development which might set us back a year or two. If you believe in the Bible for Creatives APP please support our campaign. We have some wonderful rewards up for grabs. Just check the list on the right of your screen.
 



The Bible for Creatives is being built by world-class designers and coders who understand the heart of the project.
 
For most of the design, the founder, Erin Walker (who is very passionate about design) worked with Pepperplane (pepperplane.com).
      
Pepperplane is a design studio piloted by sisters, Marié Whittington and Annette Schuman. They have partnered with clients from around the globe to create original and inspiring design solutions including Deloitte and IBM.
      
The back-end coding is being done in Apple's Swift language by Byron Rode. He runs his own Mac OS and iOS Development Agency and is Head of Technology at The Formery. Byron was previously an iOS Engineer at Over an Apple award-winning design app (madewithover.com).
Erin Walker (erinwalker.me) - the founder of the Bible for Creatives is a very happy husband and dad, managing a large family business and dabbling in many side projects via his seed company Launchround. Erin passionately loves flying in various forms from real airplanes to RC planes on the weekends. He wants to live his life on earth as close to God's heart as possible.
 

We believe the Bible for Creatives will benefit any Christian who wants to delve deeper into God's word. Everyone experiences reading the Bible differently as everyone is uniquely made. The Bible for Creatives just makes it easier to be yourself when studying the Bible. Even if you just highlight and write small notes (you don't have to be an illustrator) this app makes it possible! This is the thing that makes us really excited. We want everyone to experience God on a deeper level. 


 

The thing with risks is if you don’t ever take one, you’ll never know what could have been. This project is certainly a risk in regard to our time and energy, but we believe it’s one well-worth taking. We have already sorted large part of the design, concept, translations, and kinks because this is a project we are very passionate about. If we don’t meet our minimum raise our backers will not be charged and it will be next-to-impossible to launch in 2020. We would then seek alternative financing and launch as soon as 2021.

The challenges surrounding any project like this are always larger than originally perceived. We want to deliver a high-quality award-winning application that will change Christian's lives and make Bible study even more enjoyable. Because our team is small we don’t have access to unlimited resources to pour into this project, so setbacks are possible. From API and OS changes to late-surfacing bugs and the complexities of managing many Bible translations, patience may be required :)

</div><p> </p></div>","Here is Nanobook, in a nutshell:

Designed to be small enough to fit comfortably in your hand (8cm x 5cm) when you’re outdoors.
Nanobook made from stone, not trees. This next-generation material is non-organic and zero trees were harmed in its production.
Any weather, one paper. Will survive sweat, rain, mud, snow, oil, grease, and the wear-and-tear of daily use.  
Any pen, even your key. Can use Several Means to write on Stone paper, even your key in case there is no pen on hand. 

Nanobook revolutionized taking notes in challenging conditions.

Nanobook is small enough that it can be grasped in one hand, meaning that it can be used in all circumstances, regardless of what Mother Nature throws in your path. It can cope with all kinds of writing outdoors, even when you don’t have access to a table or another platform to write on. We made it our mission to create a notebook that you can carry and write on, wherever you are.

Regardless of the terrain you’re tackling, or the weather conditions you’re experiencing, Nanobook’s durable technology will cater to all of your note-taking needs.   

 

Measuring just 8 cm x 5 cm, It's the ideal size for taking notes on the go and strong enough to hold in one hand while writing with the other. One Nanobook=100 pages/50 sheets

We asked ourselves… what if we build a product that combines them all in one elegant, effective solution? 
 Introducing Fophie, a reinvented desktop partner. It’s a 7-in-1 USB-C hub that includes every port you’ll need in your daily life, and a convertible phone stand that provides up to 15W ultra-fast Qi wireless charging. Its versatility gives you a hand to get things done in an efficient and easy way.

 The answer to that question is Fophie. It transforms a single USB-C port into 7 useful connections, including 4K HDMI, MicroSD, SD, 2 * USB 3.1, and USB-C power delivery & data transfer along with a 15W Qi wireless phone charger. Fophie takes care of all power needs, lets you make multiple simultaneous connections and cleans up your desktop! 
 
 For the ultimate in versatility, we created two versions, Fophie is equipped with a USB-C for Power Delivery and a USB-C for Data Transfer, while Fophie Pro is equipped with two USB-C Dual Role Port (both Power Delivery and Data Transfer). 
  Compatible With Multiple Devices Laptop, monitor, hard drive, flash disk, sd card, even Switch, and more 
  
 
 Wireless charging is becoming the standard for flagship smartphones so Fophie utilizes the latest Qi wireless charging protocol that supports up to 15W ultra-high speed charging to juice your phone up fast without the need to carry an extra cable. 
  
 
 
 Wirelessly charge your phone flat or while upright, in landscape or portrait mode with a convertible phone stand that keeps your phone at the perfect angle for viewing, swiping, or taking calls. Fophie charges reliably in all positions with 3 built-in wireless charging coils to ensure that there are no charging blind spots.   
   Connect your laptop to Fophie using any USB-C port.  Get centralized! With Fophie, a single USB-C port becomes the central hub for all your power and data transfer needs. It adds practicality to your MacBook or PC by seamlessly connecting all your peripherals instantly with every port you will ever need including 4K HDMI, MicroSD, SD, and dual USB 3.1 ports using a single USB-C. 
  Thanks to the foldable and lightweight design, Fophie is ideal for on-the-go work. Fophie is a powerful desktop central connection hub but its compact design and portability make it just as good on-the-go. Take it with you wherever your busy day takes you for meetings and business travel. It adds power to presentations and efficiency to applications that benefit from dual monitors and fast data transfer. 
  Fophie also connects your Switch to a big screen for a better gaming experience. Don’t settle for less when using handheld gaming platforms. Take Fophie along and supersize your Nintendo Switch output for big screen gaming at home or on the go. Elevate your gaming experience and level up fast.  
   A Perfect Desktop Organizer Say goodbye to tangled cables and messy desktops. Fophie immediately clears your desktop of redundant cords, cables and adapters so that you can work and think more clearly. Get organized, streamline your workflow and get more done with Fophie. 
  Sleek & Compact Design Small yet powerful! Fophie is smaller than a typical smartphone and gives you unlimited versatility in a sleek, compact, modern design that fits in any pocket for go-anywhere convenience.

This process known as EEG Neurofeedback trains your brain to better focus and block out distractions over time. 
The patent-pending technology behind FocusBuds is designed from the ground up to help your brain get into deep focus and enter the 'Flow State' at will. 

FocusBuds provides real-time feedback — training your brain to concentrate and eliminate procrastination. Achieve focus like you have never imagined. 

With FocusBuds, you can get focused and stay focused quickly and easily. FocusBuds are also integrated with a host of premium features such as Bluetooth 5.0 wireless connectivity, one-touch voice control and noise isolation - making them the perfect pair of work earbuds. 
What is Flow State?
‘Flow State’ is a state where your brain is so hyper focused and immersed on a single task that hours go by without you noticing. FocusBuds trains you to slip into flow state faster and helps you stay there longer — giving you unparalleled productivity. 

 
You’ve Never Had Earbuds Like These

For people serious about reaching their full potential, FocusBuds by Potential X is an advanced cognitive enhancing wearable that is the most effective at helping you boost your focus. 
Not only does FocusBuds use EEG Neurofeedback to actively help you concentrate, it’s also a powerful set of earbuds with noise isolation technology. Listen to your music wirelessly and without distractions or noise, while you dive deep in your work.

FocusBuds first tracks your brain activity in real-time with embedded EEG biosensors.
Our advanced machine learning platform then learns the patterns in your EEG signal to determine your focus levels using approximately 400 calculated metrics.
Whenever your focus drops — FocusBuds gently guides your brain back into peak focus through auditory feedback. 

The brain is malleable and is constantly being shaped by our experience due to neuroplasticity, every repetition of a thought or emotion can create and reinforce a neural pathway.
This form of Neurofeedback has been scientifically & repeatedly proven to enhance performance (Gruzeier, 2016) and is as powerful as Ritalin (Fuchs, 2016). Plus, it works even when you take FocusBuds off — leaving behind a more focused brain better at tuning out distractions.

We spend an average of 23 minutes to focus, yet we are interrupted every 11 minutes. Over the course of our careers — 20,000 hours are wasted on being distracted in the workplace.

Does any of the following sound like you?  

You know what you need to do to become successful, but the issue is staying focused enough to finish what you started. FocusBuds is a non-invasive solution to help you concentrate, stay focused and get work done. 

With FocusBuds, you can regain your lost hours and maximize your productivity every single day — saving you 20,000 hours over your career, enough time for you to become an expert at any skill, twice! 

 


EEG Neurofeedback is a clinically-proven technology developed as a non-invasive training method to help people stay focused. EEG sensors provide real-time displays of brain activity. A program then interprets the brain activity and provides immediate audio or visual feedback when needed train the brain.

This technology has been proven repeatedly to enhance cognitive performance in numerous medical studies and has been used for the last half decade for therapeutic use and performance enhancement.

 
Previously, EEG Neurofeedback was only accessible to Fortune 500 CEOs and NASA astronauts and cost up to thousands of dollars. Now, with FocusBuds, you can get it at a fraction of the usual cost.

Rapid advances in signal processing techniques and material science over the last decade have made these earbuds possible.
Working with our team of neuroscientists and machine learning engineers for the last 1.5 years, we found a way to re-create the clinical grade effectiveness of industrial EEG machines in just 8 EEG sensors that are embedded throughout the earbuds. 



By going directly to the original manufacturer for these EEG sensors, we are also able to cut out the middleman and offer this technology to you at a much more affordable price.

By constantly reinforcing your focus behavior, FocusBuds helps you reach peak productivity & enter ‘Flow State’ consistently and effortlessly — even when you’re not using it.
The 80/20 Rule
20% of our actions lead to 80% of the results. This is because we waste so much of our actions, energy and thoughts being distracted. The 20% of results-driving action comes from focused, purposeful, distraction-free work.

Imagine if you were so focused, ALL your actions led to powerful, purposeful results. How much more meaningful work would you get done? How much time would you save to get double or triple the output?

By increasing your focused actions from 20% of your work-time to 100%, you’re essentially multiplying your efficiency and efficacy by five-times! That’s 5x the results or 5x less time you’re spending to get the same work done now. 

Since FocusBuds helps you enter flow state faster and keeps you there longer, you can truly maximize that 20% and get even more done.

Using advanced machine learning models, FocusBuds is able to track and analyze your brain activity to find patterns in your work habits. 
You’ll be able to see what environments, times of day, habits and activities keep you focused and engaged — and what distracts you. Using this data, you can optimize your life by identifying your personal peak times and environment, while avoiding areas and habits that are distracting.


Overtime, FocusBuds becomes your own highly trained personal assistant that is able to provide insights on how you can take your game to the next level. 
Plan out your days more effectively by placing tasks that require a lot of focus during your peak hours, doing less important and low-focus work during other times, and planning rest times when your body needs it most.

<p><strong>The world needs this mission!</strong> For you, your family, your city, and society.</p>
<p>We define financial wellness as financial contentment and stability to afford life. We're starting with smarter shopping for cars and experiences, but we're aiming toward the mission (life planning), which is massive -- <strong>it's not just financial, it's economic.</strong></p>
<p>We are a financial wellness startup -- a social impact company.</p>

<h2><strong><mark style=""background:#C5E8FF;"">Thank youuu!</mark></strong></h2>
</div></div>","Hello!
Economic crises destroy lives ☹️. We want to change that so people live better while growing financially. It's the first shopping meets finance app: Zestefy is a life planner for your shopping and goals using automated financial planning.

Shop for electronics, vacations, cars, houses, and deals.
Explore goals like jobs, where to live, starting a family.
Automatically grow your financial stability. 

...think navigation for your life :) 
We need your support to transform the prototype into a super app and improve the AI. People love our approach: we won a startup pitch competition with 76% of the votes! Pitch video above (second one) or way below.
 
Summary below and prototype (gifs, videos, screenshots)...
 
 
Problem...Yikes!
Shopping is very easy, but affording everything we want is very hard.
Examples:You bought that pricey car...then you cannot afford that vacation and it delays destroying debt. You traveled a bunch, lost your job...then you don't have enough savings to cover months of expenses.
Attempts:

You can spend weeks learning and applying general advice from books and videos -- like don't eat out, make and don't buy coffee, save money, invest (in yourself and stocks) -- but all of that is not fast and easy like shopping!
Budgeting and savings apps do not solve the problem. We need smarter.

 

 
To me, the overspending and mishaps are...not...your...fault. 
 
Solution...Woo!
People need intelligence at the speed of their consumption...personalized and convenient. It requires blending these fields: shopping, lifestyle, finance, income, psychology, and artificial intelligence. Our approach... 
Zestefy is a life planning app for your shopping and goals using automated financial planning.
What you want + financial stability...


Shop smarter:
See what you can afford, when, how, and get deals.
Vacations, devices, cars, houses, furniture, appliances, gifts, events. 
Financial and insurance products.



Explore goals:
If I get a raise or get a lower-paying job, then what can I afford?
If I want a pricier house, then what kind of car can I afford?
Where should I live, given my income and family? 



Get more with intelligence (mock-ups):

 App learns from your likes (clip from prototype): 
 
App shows what you can afford, when, how (clip from prototype): 

 
Who This is For


The savvy shopper: you look for deals, you shop around before buying...takes a lot of time, you hate overpaying. 

The analytical saver: you analyze money, you plan in spreadsheets, you research...takes a lot of effort, you like being smart. 

 
People Want This
Great signs...
A big company wants the ""Google Maps for Money"", and we want to lead the way https://a16z.com/2019/10/01/google-maps-for-money/

Survey on April 26, 2021, of general prospects (before our pitch win) found that 73% want our service, based only on watching our crowdfunding video.
 
Video of Winning Pitch
We won a startup pitch competition with 76% of the votes...

 
 
Proof of our ""runaway victory"":https://www.youtubestartend.com/view.php?v=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vZW1iZWQvalhiZGpEeDZtVTQ/c3RhcnQ9NDE0MiZlbmQ9NDE4MyZ2ZXJzaW9uPTM=
 
Cool convo with CEO of Founders Live:https://founderslivepodcast.buzzsprout.com/6531...
 
 
Our Mission
To empower people with financial wellness and success in life.
The world needs this mission! For you, your family, your city, and society.
We define financial wellness as financial contentment and stability to afford life. We're starting with smarter shopping for cars and experiences, but we're aiming toward the mission (life planning), which is massive -- it's not just financial, it's economic.
We are a financial wellness startup -- a social impact company.
 
Me, Our Founder
I'm Ihsan (eh-son), a data scientist and applied mathematician:

I've worked in media, marketing, consulting, and personal finance. 
I've been exploring the problem and building the core solution since 2015.
I've seen and felt economic pain since 2001 -- this is my life's passion.
I like practical solutions. Word I hate: perfect. 
Yes, I'm all in my startup.

My profile on LinkedIn.

 
What We Need
$20,000...but much more...because our mission is massive.
Currently, the team is just me. We want to improve and transform the prototype into a phone app that can launch in 2022.
The funds will signal to potential employees and investors that people want the Zestefy service! Use of the $20k is roughly...

$2k so I can improve the AI system with possibly licensed software.
$3k for testing and scaling the prototype on a cloud provider.
$3k in labor as CEO and lead scientist.
$8k in labor for phone app development.
$4k for app design and interface (UI, UX).

But yea, we need way more to build the team and product for years to come.

 
What You Get
Reward based on level of support:


Limited quantity! Flexible phone/tablet holder (ETA 8/2021) + 1 year of our Premium Life Planner (ETA 6/2023). Focus on watching or listening without fussing with your phone.

Quality shirt (ETA 8/2021) + our premium Life Planner (ETA 2023), free forever + (if you'd like) public recognition as our early-and-bold supporter.

1 year free of our Premium Life Planner (ETA 2023).
Virtual red carpet for a private trial of our Life Planner. Beta test, celeb style (ETA 2022).
A private edu-taining video about Zestefy's vision with research (ETA 10/2021).


 
Risks & Challenges
I've been bootstrapping on my own funds, but this startup can fail if I run out of cash.
I need to build a team (and pay them) to transform the prototype with me into a service people can have. 
Examples of challenges:

If the app is too nerdy about finances.
If the app is too much about shopping.
If the app is not flexible enough for your scenarios.
If the app does not show enough product inventory.
If the AI is not insightful enough.
If the AI is too slow.

We are a social impact company with a revenue-generating business model, but we have to focus on building and hunting. I'm a realist: high impact + high revenue = very hard.

Vinpok is committed to offering customers the most innovative products, and the highest quality in every detail through advanced technology.Time is always the most challenging part when trying to bring a product to life as there are so many procedures that must be managed. However, with this being our fourth Indiegogo campaign, we can confidently say that we are already familiar with the Crowdfunding process. Most importantly, the electronic product design and production are no strangers to us. We believe that our experienced team can well mitigate all potential risks in this journey. And will strive for excellence from project planning, production to order shipping. If there’s any obstacle, we will definitely keep you in the loop. Thanks for supporting us! Due to different countries' laws and regulations of custom duty, there are chances that backers need to pay custom duty.",25.0,7,"4 Campaigns

Not only did you help bring Orbitkey to life, you also allow us to focus on making great products and keep doing the things we love – without the influence of outside investors.We are a team of 22 passionate individuals based in Melbourne, Australia – driven by design, innovation and clever organisation. This new project is the result of continuous feedback and hard work over the past year. We hope to have you join us on our journey towards better living.  Here at Orbitkey, we’ve been taking scalable steps to permanently reduce our carbon emissions, and in April 2020, we became a Climate Neutral Certified Brand!Climate Neutral is an independent non-profit organisation that provides tools for companies to:Measure their carbon footprint through economic modeling;Reduce​ their emissions by developing and implementing carbon reduction plans;Offset​ their emissions if they cannot be immediately reduced by purchasing carbon credits; andUse the label to empower customers to choose brands that choose to pay for their carbon emissions.Carbon credits are in turn invested into reducing and capturing carbon dioxide, and can support a range of projects such as forest conservation and renewable energy.This year, we will ensure that at least 50% of our new products will be made from LWG certified leather and recycled fabric materials. Likewise, 80% of our packaging will be produced from recyclable materials. We will also reduce our air freight shipments company-wide by 40%, and at our headquarters in Melbourne, we will reduce our paper and toner emissions by 60%. But we know that this is only the beginning, and we will continue to improve our processes and further reduce our emissions every year. Risks and challengesWe have a pretty good track record with our previous 5 campaigns – with most rewards being shipped on time or with a 1-month delay at most. Our previous campaigns have also given us valuable experience in all aspects of bringing a product to life and running a crowdfunding campaign.It has better prepared us in the challenges associated with tooling, production, logistics, communication, and delivering a high-quality product.However, there are always challenges and unforeseen obstacles that arise when trying to bring a product to life.In the case of encountering unavoidable obstacles, we have always handled them swiftly and efficiently, and have always conducted things in the best interest of our backers and Orbitkey family. We always keep our backers updated with complete transparency.We will do our very best to ensure we deliver what we promise and to go the extra mile whenever possible. Thanks for believing in us! Environmental commitmentsLong-lasting designWe've made a commitment that everything we do and build needs to add value and help our community live better lives. If they don’t, we should rethink why we’re doing it, and work out a better approach. Our products are designed with the best materials and built to last – tested thoroughly to withstand heavy use. We love that we're still seeing plenty of backers from our first Indiegogo campaign in 2013 still using the rewards they received then. Reusability and recyclabilityOur products are designed to last. However, should you encounter any problems with any of the parts, you can let us know and we'll be able to send you a specific replacement part. Sustainable materialsThe leather that will be used in the production of the ID Card holder System is LWG-certified gold-rated leather. It means that the leather is produced in a sustainable way with a focus on minimising environmental impact. The lanyard is also made of 100% recycled woven polyester thread. We pride ourselves in using no plastic in our packaging and ensuring that any paper material can be recycled. Environmentally friendly factoriesAll our factories have been carefully selected and are partners we've been working with for several years. We have team members on the ground who visit the factories on a regular basis to ensure that quality, ethical and environmental standards are upheld. Sustainable DistributionWe plan to optimise our shipping routes by utilising sea freight to transport bulk quantities to local warehouses to reduce the carbon footprint of our delivery plan.",28.0,0,"5 Campaigns

The fanttik NEX isn’t just a traditional workman’s tool. It can also be customized to express your unique, personal style. The NEX L1 Pro comes in Moon Grey and Midnight Blue, while the NEX L1 model comes in Moon Grey, Matcha Green and Rose Red.

 

The fanttik NEX itself is just one part of a whole system of tools and parts that provide everything you need to finish the job. Our accessories include 12x 1-inch S2 alloy steel bits, 1x 2-inch bit, 1x 60mm extension rod, 1x USB-C charging cable, and a storage box. These accessories are high precision tools constructed of tough, resilient materials, perfect for use in all your projects.


For DIY-enthusiasts with lots of work to do, fanttik has you covered too. We offer a variety of extra bits and other accessories that have the same toughness and durability as our regular parts. Extra bits are ideal for regular users who expect to be doing plenty of screwdriving. The heavy-duty carry bag allows you to transport your tools in comfort and style, while we also offer precision bits perfect for small spaces and tasks requiring tiny, delicate screw heads.

 

fanttik is a brand of technological innovation in a full range of HOME & DIY power tools which draws from “fantastic”, meaning passion, focus and challenge. We are trying to explore human ingenuity in tools, and interpreting the ultimate interaction between tools and life. 
What fanttik pursues is not the type of traditional power tool, but the new, innovative and interactive one which is based on the users’ needs. We not only cares about the product's performance but also the experience of the users. We hope people can feel and experience totally different products. That’s why fanttik NEX L1 and fanttik NEX L1 Pro were created.

Other litter boxes with various automatic features are complicated, unreliable and very expensive.   That’s why we created Igloo, an affordable automatic modern cat litter box with fully enclosed design. Igloo is a revolutionary litter box that all cat owners need. Not only better for you, but also better for your cat!  Igloo was designed to free you from the unpleasant and time-consuming chore of scooping. It uses a more convenient and sanitary method. Each time after your cat finishes their business, Igloo starts a one hour countdown to make sure cat feces is dry and then initiates a cleaning cycle that funnels all wastes into a tightly-sealed receptacle. All you have to do is to discard the waste bag once in a while.   Each cleaning cycle takes about 90 seconds. The built-in cat recognition sensor detects whether your cat is entering or exiting the box. If your cat hops back in during a cleaning cycle, Igloo will pause the cycle automatically.   After each visit from the cat, the waste is stored in the waste drawer. When full (about once per week for a single cat) a notification is sent by app. Then, simply press the button on the litter box or the Igloo app. This will seal the waste bag automatically, making it ready for you to discard at your convenience.  After discarding, Igloo will automatically replace the waste bag with a clean one.     With a fully enclosed design and automatic cleaning system, the waste receptacle is concealed and kept as airtight as possible. There won't be any waste exposed to the open air. Igloo keeps the air fresh both inside and outside.   Litter tracking and spillage are minimized with Igloo. Holes on the soft silicone doorstep help stretch cats' paws to catch litter granules before the cat exits.     Your cat’s wellbeing is one of the most important things to us. Designed with a gravity sensor, Igloo is totally safe and secure. When your cat enters and exits the litter box, the sensor will detect immediately and the machine will not enter the cleaning cycle and it will stop the machine if it is already rotating.  The litter cleaning cycle has a failsafe, if the cat feces is stuck or any blockage occurs, Igloo will immediately stop rotating and reverse to release the stuck unit. At the same time, users will receive notification immediately through the APP.   Easily Convert Between Three Modes  Igloo can switch to various working modes, such as auto, manual and night mode, to perfectly suit the needs of you and your cat.   App Control   Connect Igloo with your home Wi-Fi. It'll stay connected thus you can control it in the Igloo App wherever you're at.  With Igloo App, you can view the waste drawer level and get notifications at any time. Igloo will indicate when there is an error of any kind. The system even weighs your cat’s body weight when inside so that you can gain insight into your cat's health. Easy to Use  You can use the App to initiate the Automatic cleaning mode or select Manual cleaning if you wish.  Change Litter once a week.  For a single cat, auto-packing the waste once per week is sufficient. Multiple Cats? No Problem!  Igloo is designed to accommodate multiple cats of any size. It has a large enough waste capacity for up to 3 cats per Igloo unit.       2020.11.13 Shipping Update2020.11.19 Shipping Update",34.0,0,"1 Campaign

Some of our more overt inspirations include:</p><ul>
<li>The ring of the zinc alloy pedestal is inspired by the saucer section of the USS Enterprise.</li>
<li>The landing dock on the pedestal is based on the spherical shape of planets and moons.</li>
<li>The curves of the pen itself borrows elements of famous rockets and shuttles.</li>

  Hoverpen 2.0: Interstellar Edition was designed to impress, resisting gravity at a 23.5 degree angle. Perfectly balanced thanks to its painstaking craftsmanship, the way Hoverpen 2.0 defies gravity makes it impossible to ignore.   Just as Earth's gravity loses its authority in space, so too does gravity flounder against Hoverpen 2.0 as it pushes back against the laws of physics.  With its new ridged design the Hoverpen 2.0 becomes a mesmerizing marvel to watch when spinning, as its circular acceleration and deceleration are now fully visible. A simple twist will send the pen spinning for up to 20 seconds in flawless, kinetic motion.  Fun to fidget, hypnotic to watch - Hoverpen 2.0 provides much needed entertainment during those dull workdays. Give it a spin, sit back, and ponder on the mysteries of the universe as the Hoverpen 2.0 revolves over and over.  According to numerous studies, task switching has been shown to improve creativity and problem solving. Researchers found that by constantly switching tasks, people improved both their convergent thinking (logical thinking) and divergent thinking (out-of-the-box thinking) when faced with creative tasks. A study by Harvard Business Review found that frequently interrupting your brainstorming with consistent micro-breaks resulted in more idea generation than no breaks.  The Hoverpen was designed around this idea. Picture the scene: you're hard at work on a new project. You arrive at a seemingly impossible problem and are mulling it over when you spot the Hoverpen on your desk and give it a spin. Over the next hour, you look up and spin the Hoverpen from time to time. Without even realizing it, you've reformatted your brain into an idea generation machine and crunch through the problem effortlessly.We designed Hoverpen as the ultimate task-switching tool. Every now and then, take a moment out of your day, spin the pen, and boost your creativity like never before.  Here are some task switching articles for your big brain to chew on:      Inspired by the shape of famous science fiction spacecraft such as the USS Enterprise, Naboo Starships, and Interstellar's Ranger spacecraft - the design elements of the Hoverpen 2.0 are a delight to science fiction fans like ourselves.   The sleek, dynamic lines of the pen body offer a glimpse of the advanced future we've all read about and seen on the silver screen.  While the pen is ergonomically shaped to feel soft and gentle in the hand, the Hoverpen 2.0's pedestal takes on a new shape inspired by Star Trek's USS Enterprise. Its magnetized ring design keeps the pen suspended in place, giving it that ""floating in space"" flair that we know fans of sci fi and space exploration will come to love.  The casing of Hoverpen 2.0's body is crafted from a single piece of aircraft grade aluminum. It is uniquely machined as one long piece of metal - giving it it an aura of high quality craftsmanship rarely seen in other pens.   While the head is a separate screw-on - so that reloading the cartridge is possible - the rest of the pen is constructed from what we like to call a ""uni-body"" design.  The material for the body is carved from high quality aluminum sourced from a premium supplier. With a long-lasting aircraft grade aluminum body, Hoverpen 2.0 is designed to last for decades.  Hoverpen 2.0 also comes in a stunning premium upgrade option: 18k gold plating. These real 18k gold embellisments will take your Hoverpen 2.0 from extravagant to extraordinary. The gold-plated Hoverpen 2.0 is truly an incredible sight to behold, as light glints off the precious metal adornments making your Hoverpen 2.0 seemingly glow as the pen spins against gravity.  We have a limited quantity of gold-embellished Hoverpen 2.0s as part of this campaign, at a $30 discount. Instead of paying $149 MSRP, limited gold edition Hoverpen early bird pledges are available for only $119.  To add gold plating to your ALL-IN, 2x, 6x, 15x, or Meteorite pledge, simply add $44 per pen.   With a soft ergonomic finish, Hoverpen 2.0: Interstellar Edition feels like satin in the hand. Soft and gentle to the touch, our latest Hoverpen was designed to make long, strenuous writing sessions feel light and enjoyable.  Hoverpen 2.0's curved lines are not only visually stunning, they sit right along the hollow of your hand, making for a more pleasurable writing experience.  At Shanpo, we're obsessed with magnetism - it's why we've even made the cap for the Hoverpen 2.0 magnetically snap into place. Just holding the pen a small distance from the lid is enough for the cap to get sucked onto the pen.  Just playing with the magnetic cap can provide hours of fidgeting bliss. We've designed every element of Hoverpen 2.0 to fit into your daily work life.  With a pen and premium as the Hoverpen 2.0, it'd be a shame to load it with anything but the best ink cartridges. Hoverpen 2.0 comes equipped with Schmidt ballpoint cartridges, the German-engineered luxury standard in ballpoint pens. Versatile yet flexible, Hoverpen 2.0 promises no spills, no spotting, and definitely no explosions.  Like most other high-end luxury pens, the Hoverpen 2.0 is complete reloadable. Simply pull out the cartridge using the included pincher tool and re-insert any D1 sized refill. Quick and easy reloads make the Hoverpen 2.0 one of the most versatile pens on the market for a fraction of the price of a luxury designer pen.We also include one free extra cartridge in each pledge (or an extra graphite rod if pledging for the graphite pencil option).   Already have the original Hoverpen and looking for something different? Or maybe you're an engineer or artist looking for something you can draft with? Hoverpen 2.0 is now available as a graphite pencil. That's right, we've finally designed a Hoverpencil! Mistake-makers rejoice!  Quickly and easily reload the pencil by stabbing the included pincher and reinserting any 2mm graphite pencil lead. Just like with the pen version, we've included an extra refill with every pledge. We've also included a free sharpening module, pictured above, to keep your writing nimble and clean.  We said we're fans of space, cosmology and astronomy, and we know you are too. We'd be letting our backers down unless we offered them something truly unique, something truly one-of-a-kind.So we went out and found a real meteorite. And then we added it to the tip of the Hoverpen 2.0: Interstellar Edition. That's right, now you can have a genuine piece of outer space sitting right there on your work desk.  We obtained this meteorite at an auction from a member of the IMCA (International Meteorite Collectors Association), so it is fully authentic. Each Meteorite edition of the Hoverpen 2.0 will be completely unique. No two pens will have the same pattern thanks to a special acid process used to bring out the details of the meteorite and the imperfections etched by space and time itself. Every Meteorite pledge will receive a unique numbered card with information on their extremely special pen and its origins.  The Muonionalusta meteorite landed in northern Scandanavia over one million years ago. Muonionalusta meteorite is the oldest meteorite on Earth, and now you can own a piece of it - a piece of cosmic history, a symbol of the ageless expanse of the universe - sitting in the palm of your hand. This is truly an incredible, rare, and legendary upgrade to the Hoverpen 2.0  We only have 50 of these incredible pens available as Muonionalusta meteorite is so rare and difficult to acquire. If you're a student of the cosmos, or simply passionate about the universe beyond, don't miss out on bringing a mysterious piece of it to your desktop.  The meteorite on the end of the Muonionalusta Meteorite Hoverpen 2.0 is 20 million years older than the Earth itself. Not only can you now own a piece of this ancient beauty, you can write with it every day as it sits embedded onto the end of your Hoverpen.   All Muonionalusta Meteorite pledges will come in a premium box and include every add-on from the ALL-IN pledge for free.We're also going to include a special mystery gift for all Muonionalusta Meteorite backers - to be revealed at a later date!For an extra $44, you can also enhance the Muonionalusta Meteorite Hoverpen 2.0 with the limited edition 18k gold plating upgrade to create a truly unmatched, legendary Hoverpen. 
  At Shanpo, we're not shy about our love of all things space. Science fiction, astronomy, the history of the universe - these things have made us the people we are today. When we started brainstorming what the ultimate Hoverpen would look like, we wanted it to be more than just a fantastic writing instrument and desktop marvel - we wanted it represent us and our journey. Some of our more overt inspirations include:
The ring of the zinc alloy pedestal is inspired by the saucer section of the USS Enterprise.
The landing dock on the pedestal is based on the spherical shape of planets and moons.
The curves of the pen itself borrows elements of famous rockets and shuttles.
 

  Highly precise craftsmanship of the pedestal has the Hoverpen sitting in a ring of magnetic repulsion. Balancing against at a 23.5 degree angle, the pen itself is engineered to take a stand against gravity itself.  Our manufacturing has to be unbelievably precise, because a discrepancy of more than 1 mm in any direction will cause the pen to fall out of the ring. For this reason, we will be on the ground at the factory during production, doing product testing ourselves and assuring the top-tier quality standards our backers are used to. Our calculations need to be as flawless as a rocket scientist's prior to launch. 
  
  To really round out the experience of your Hoverpen 2.0, we've created a variety of luxury add-ons. To purchase an add-on, simply add the price of the add-on to your Indiegogo pledge.   
You love space. We love space. Let's Hoverpen 2.0's launch together! Backers will receive a fully metal Saturn token as a FREE gift in every ALL-IN and Gold pledges. The Hoverpen Saturn token is fully magnetic too, the perfect compliment to the magnetic marvel of Hoverpen 2.0. 
  This classy decoration looks fitting next to the mysterious, shapely allure of the Hoverpen 2.0 and is just as soothing to fidget with. Spin the pen, fiddle with Saturn, and let your mind drift beyond the blue horizon.  Our beloved magnetic Shanpo notebooks are back! These notebooks are equipped with graph paper, making it the perfect notebook for engineers, designers, or drafters. They look classy, are made from high quality materials, and snap close thanks to its magnetic cover flap.  Add $20 to your pledge to pick up a branded notebook. With its dark color and magnetic flap, the Shanpo notebook is the perfect companion to the Hoverpen 2.0.  Just when you thought the Hoverpen 2.0 couldn't get any classier, we've upgraded the accent base in Hoverpen 2.0 to darkened glass. This 5mm near-black glass base reflects the artistic design of the Hoverpen 2.0, giving it a sense of luxury and prestige.  The glass accent base also comes with a metal name plate holder.

Apple's MacBook Pro has been considered as a benchmark for business laptop by many users, but not everyone can afford the price of MacBook Pro. CHUWI strives to refine laptops with more cost-effective prices but provide the same or even better hardware configuration. For one-third of MacBook Pro’s price, users can get even better using experience. Everything we do at CHUWI, every choice we make, is inspired by what we think defines “radical innovation”. We realized that the advancements in 4K displays, size, and robust performance would benefit more than just businessmen, but anyone who is always on the go.1. 4K Retina screen, more than 1.07 billion colour displayThe most popular mobile PC form factor today is the 15.6-inch laptop. It provides a great balance of size and portability for the majority of home and office users.Moreover, equipped with a 4K Ultra HD screen, visuals look their best, with wide viewing angles and vivid, accurate colours. Perfect for 2D design workflows. Apply text, graphics, colours and effects to design layouts fast and efficiently. And when it’s time to publish, you’ll have full confidence in your colours, thanks to the 4K UHD, 100% sRGB accuracy panel.You will see sharper and clearer texts, when compared to 1080p for document processings. 2.Intel i5 6287U processor, the same as the Macbook Pro  Featuring the Intel® Core™ processors seen in the MacBook pro, integrated Intel® Iris graphics and a full catalogue of high-quality, performance components, AeroBook Plus will never keep you waiting.

With a maximum of 340 nits brightness, the screen remains visible even outdoors. Intel Core i5 series is equipped with professional-level Iris graphics cards.Equipped with an Intel i5 6287U processor, dual-core, four threads, and a frequency of up to 3.5GHz, AeroBook Plus deals with complex documents efficiently, and easily handles large applications. The Intel Iris Graphics 550 GPU, featuring 48 execution units (EU), ensures you a longer battery life while being able to produce stunning lifelike imagery.

That Kickstarter campaign was initially designed to be a short, $10,000 fundraising effort to design some simple pronunciation resources, but ended up raising $96,000 and expanding to 65 different products over the following 3.5 years. Demand for those products never stopped after the 2013 Kickstarter, and so The Fluent Forever company grew up in order to meet its customer's needs. In September of 2017, it launched a second Kickstarter to create a single app that automates the entire Fluent Forever method.

Rather than teach you words by a theme (like colors), which delivers the worst retention results, Fluent Forever places words in actual environments where the word would naturally be used.For example: instead of learning ""green"" by tediously memorizing a list of all colors, you would learn ""green"" within a scene that features a prominent green-colored item, like a green frog sitting on a green lily pad on a pond surrounded by green grass. Learning ""green"" by context instead of thematic category makes a word more than 100% faster to memorize and also ensures the best retention. Fluent Forever's purposeful word association means you're learning several words at the same time with the best retention instead of just one with mediocre retention! Learn At Your Own PaceNo one learns the same. Pick easy, medium, or difficult-level phrases and recordings to learn at your own pace.Use a photo from your own albums, or access our innovative, easy-to-use image search engine. Great for visual learners!Create tools to help you learn different elements of language: vocab, conjugations, or word order. Automatically receive customized lessons based on your learning.Save yourself time by accessing our community database of approved user-generated content. All content approved by our staff and native speakers.Have questions about grammar or vocabulary? Native speakers are there to help you get answers to your questions in-app! “Starting with pronunciation is genius. Pure and simple. [...] I believe that I am learning Spanish in a way that makes sense for me in ways that a classroom setting never did. [It’s] a language teaching method that is based on the logic of how people learn language.”- Marsha M. Easily Push Information Into Long-Term MemoryWe use the most powerful learning tool: The Spaced Repetition System. This means we'll show you and test you on words we know you're going to forget before you've forgotten them. This process rapidly pushes those words into your long term memory.The app will walk you through a series of choices: which words do you want to learn? What sentences will you use to learn them? What pictures do you want for each word? While you're making those choices, you're learning your target language.The app automatically prepares customized, fully immersive flashcards for future review.It knows which words you’re going to forget and tests you on them beforehand. You learn vocab and grammar in the process of creating your own tools.You'll learn via a three-step process.  You need to learn what a language sounds like before you can learn how to speak it. This trains your ears in the sound system of your new language.   Quickly understand thousands of words and phrases through Fluent Forever's word association methods. You'll learn grammar through immersive stories, not boring lessons.You'll never be forced to learn words or grammar you don’t need.  Quickly maneuver through your personalized content and study tools to retain everything that you've learned. “I am actually thinking in Spanish which is amazing. I have tried other products such as DuoLingo and Babbel, but none of them had me thinking in Spanish.”- Dave R. What Languages Will It Support?Spanish (Latin American), French, German, Italian, Russian, Korean, English, Spanish (Castilian), Portuguese, Dutch, Hebrew, Arabic, Japanese, Chinese (Mandarin), more coming soon! “My progress has been pretty remarkable in terms of efficiency...When I went to study abroad in Spain this summer, they put me in the highest class at two different programs. I think I'd had about 7 actual Spanish lessons at that point.” - Nick P.  Compatible With iOS And Android About UsFluent Forever, Inc. came into being as a result of a 2013 Kickstarter campaign to create pronunciation training tools that worked in concert with Gabriel Wyner’s book, Fluent Forever. That Kickstarter campaign was initially designed to be a short, $10,000 fundraising effort to design some simple pronunciation resources, but ended up raising $96,000 and expanding to 65 different products over the following 3.5 years. Demand for those products never stopped after the 2013 Kickstarter, and so The Fluent Forever company grew up in order to meet its customer's needs. In September of 2017, it launched a second Kickstarter to create a single app that automates the entire Fluent Forever method. Within its first 6 days, that Kickstarter became the most funded app Kickstarter of all time. Frequently Asked QuestionsHow many months do I need to learn a language?That'll depend on two things: how much time you're studying every day, and how challenging your language is. Based on my own experiences, if you're studying for ~45 min/day and you're an English native speaker, you should be able to reach a fairly solid level of fluency (CEFR levels B2/C1) in the following amounts of time:

6 months: Level 1 languages (Closely related to English): Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch. German is a level 1.5 language, so ~9 months.

12 months: Level 2 languages (Significantly different from English): Russian, Hebrew (If we get support for all languages, this category would also include things like Hindi, Icelandic, Greek, Hungarian, Turkish, Urdu)

24 months: Level 3 languages (Very different from English): Korean, Japanese, Mandarin, Arabic

 AboutWhat is Fluent Forever? The first app that can take you all the way to fluency in your language of choice.Who Created it?Gabriel Wyner - the author of the book, Fluent ForeverWhy should we use it?For anyone who has ever wanted to learn a language and failed, this is the tool that will finally bring you to fluency.How much does it cost? $90 will bring you to fluency in a closely related language like French or SpanishWhere can we buy it?On Indiegogo InDemandWhat do we get when we order?Early access to the app along with our groundbreaking Pronunciation Trainer and Sentence List in your language of choiceWhy are you crowdfunding?We're crowdfunding to finance development of the appWho should I contact for press?.Please email us here: corinne@leeandlondon.comTech SpecsWhat is the uniqueness of the technology?This is the first app designed to teach you how to *think* in your target language instead of translating.How does it work?It uses Minimal Pair Testing to train your ears and teach pronunciation, followed by a flashcard customization process that allows you to learn a language while staying in control of your own learning process. The flashcards you create are put into a Spaced Repetition System to rapidly push words and grammar into your long term memory.Will there be updates to it in the future?Yes, we'll keep it current with the latest updates to iOS and Android, and continually add language support and grow our databases of proofread sentences.How does it integrate with other connected devices? It will sync with your iOS and Android devices. We will be looking into additional platforms as we move forward.About The AppDoes it have an app? Which phones does it work with?It's an iOS/Android native app.Can we also access app functions on a web browser? Some of the app functionality (adding sentences and managing your subscription, in particular) will be accessible via your web browser. What can we expect from the app?This will be the most effective language learning tool on the market. Safety And Regulation What are the recommended ages?The app should be relatively easy to learn. We’re working with our lawyers to figure out recommended ages (we’ll probably land on ages 13+, in part due to legal concerns about keeping flashcard data from minors under 13).Will this benefit my kids?Learning a language is one of the greatest gifts you can give a kid. Aside from giving them a new ability to communicate with more people, it has a ton of documented side benefits, ranging from better test scores in all core subjects, better problem solving abilities, higher salaries once they reach the job market, etc. Where can I use it?You can use it anywhere. You'll need an internet connection to actively create new flashcards, but you can review your old flashcards offline.How is my privacy protected?We'll be keeping user data secure, both on their phones and in connections with our servers. We're early in design, so the specific technologies we'll be using to keep data secure are still getting decided.How secure is it?We'll be keeping user data secure, both on their phones and in connections with our servers. We're early in design, so the specific technologies we'll be using to keep data secure are still getting decided.Can someone watch or listen to me?No, we don't monitor users in that way!Are there any risks associated with use?No. Credits:Many thanks to the extraordinary members of the Fluent Forever team, who have been putting in long hours to get this project (and the last one) ready!To my readers and backers, I love you.

However, after the release of Intel's 10th generation Ice Lake-U, we found that with the 10nm process, 15W TDP, 4 cores and 8 threads, twice the number of transistors (compared to the previous generation) and 6MB L3 cache, this product is superior to AMD Ryzen 5 2500U in terms of overall performance. In particular, Intel's 11th-generation Iris Plus Graphics 940, as an integrated graphics chip featuring lower power consumption and heat dissipation, <strong>actually performs in 3DMark 11 nearly as good as NVIDIA GeForce MX250</strong>, a discrete graphics chip. Considering the above (especially Intel AMD integrated graphics for the first time), we finally decided to go with the Intel solution.

All these disadvantages make it hard to call WIN 2 a full-featured gaming console.In view of the above, we want to create something completely new: An ALL IN ONE product that combines the portability of a handheld and the graphics performance of a gaming laptop. We named it ""WIN Max"". Because such a product requires processor that is highly efficient and powerful, we have been kept waiting for the right product to appear.Initially we considered using AMD's mobile processor Ryzen 5 2500U. However, after the release of Intel's 10th generation Ice Lake-U, we found that with the 10nm process, 15W TDP, 4 cores and 8 threads, twice the number of transistors (compared to the previous generation) and 6MB L3 cache, this product is superior to AMD Ryzen 5 2500U in terms of overall performance. In particular, Intel's 11th-generation Iris Plus Graphics 940, as an integrated graphics chip featuring lower power consumption and heat dissipation, actually performs in 3DMark 11 nearly as good as NVIDIA GeForce MX250, a discrete graphics chip. Considering the above (especially Intel AMD integrated graphics for the first time), we finally decided to go with the Intel solution. Considering the above (especially Intel having better integrated graphics than AMD for the first time), we finally decided to use the Intel solution. As a product that is focused on gaming, WIN Max needs to be tough and durable. As such, we've decided to give it an upper cover made of CNC magnesium aluminum alloy and a main body made of LG-DOW 121H aviation-grade anti-shock ABS synthetic resin. The final product features 1.3mm shell thickness, high temperature resistance, Class V-0 fire resistance, 109R Rockwell hardness, 26000kg/cm2 bending resistance, an intact rate of 92% in 5m drop tests.The button of the machine is curved with chamfered edges, 49.7% of which is hollowed-out for air intake. And foot pads of 3mm height are attached to the bottom of the machine to avoid obstruction of air flow.On the back of the machine, there are L1 / L2 and R1 / R2 buttons on both sides, various ports in the middle (Type-C, Thunderbolt 3, USB A 3.1 × 2, HDMI), and 9 air outlets below the hinge (to avoid hinge blocking air-flow).

The following table shows the benchmarking results in some games (1280 × 800 resolution, default settings):  * Description: Testing environment: i5-1035G7 / 16GB LPDDR4X 3733 / 512GB NVMe SSD / 1280 × 800 / Windows 10 Home version 1909.     WIN Max uses an 8-inch H-IPS panel protected by fifth-generation Corning Gorilla glass.  Other features of the screen include in-cell full lamination, 33% more screen real estate compared to last generation model, 90% DCI-P3 wide color gamut, DC dimming without flickering, 500nits brightness, twice the pixel density of a 24-inch / 1080P display, a horizontal viewing angle of 178 °, 10-point touch support, a default resolution of 1280 × 800 (perfect for playing classic games under 1024 × 768 resolution (4: 3)).How could an 8-inch 1280×800 screen be better in clarity than a regular laptop screen?It's not that larger screen size and higher resolution automatically mean better clarity! We use ""PPI"" (the number of pixels per inch) to indicate the correspondence between screen size and resolution, and PPI is the determining factor for screen sharpness. The higher the PPI, the more pixels to be displayed, meaning the screen looks less grainy. The following are PPI values of common laptop screens:  As can be seen from the above figure, the PPI of WIN Max exceeds that of common laptops currently on the market. Players do not need to worry about the display quality of WIN Max, because the clarity of its panel is clearly better than that of an ordinary laptop!  In terms of built-in joysticks, WIN Max adopts the sink-in design and Xinput mode of the game controller. The ultra-durable dual 3D joysticks produced by Japan Alps, can be used as L3 / R3 buttons (support 360 ° rotation) after pressing down. In terms of working life, the potentiometer and center stack of the joystick can be used for 2 million and 5 million spins respectively. To avoid finger-slipping during gaming, the joysticks have curved rocker caps made of hard materials with strong resistance (the right joystick is in the same position as that of GPD WIN).  In terms of the D-pad, WIN Max uses the split arrow key layout of the PS4 controller to facilitate subtle precise movement. The ABXY buttons are still made with double layer silk-printing, with appropriate spacing between the buttons that facilitates comfortable pressing without errors.  The L1 / L2 R1 / R2 buttons all have highly-reliable Panasonic micro switches, with mechanical service life reaching 10 million times and electrical service life reaching 100,000 times, and operating temperature of -54 ~ 177 degrees Celsius.  Select, Start buttons are located near the top hinge to facilitate operation with left thumb. Clicking the button while streaming an game can turn on / off the joystick and activate functions such as ""back to home"", ""long press to turn off"", ""screen capture"", ""snap to position"".  Online game players love good keyboards and WIN 2's pan-shaped keyboard can't meet their requirements due to problems such as narrow pitches, short key stroke and lack of tactile feeling. In view of these problems, we decided to use a scissor-shaped membrane keyboard when designing WIN Max, and even had to increase the screen frame for this purpose.  Especially for the two sets of keys (""QWER"" and ""ASDF"") most commonly used by players, in order to achieve desktop-level tactile feeling, the size of the buttons cannot be reduced. Under these circumstances, WIN Max adopts a standard ""QWERTY"" chiclet-style full keyboard layout with backlight, making it easy to transform the machine into a perfect mini-gaming laptop by connecting an external mouse.  But what if you want to play some games but don't have a mouse with you. It's simple, just turn the “mouse / joystick” switch on the side of machine to immediately transform the joystick into a track point and L1 / R1 buttons into the left / right mouse button, so that you can use the machine as a handheld, making it fit for more usage scenarios.Even without the mouse / joystick switch function, WIN Max also has a built-in touchpad, which supports gestures with up to three-fingers and push-down operations.No matter games playing or office working and No matter holding by both hands or putting on desktop.The built-in gamepads&touchpad can meet your operation requirements.  To improve thermal performance, WIN Max adopts the cooling solution of PC-class twin turbo fans + dual heat pipes. With dual heat pipes + high-power turbo fans, high-displacement side-blowing design, 9-hole ultra-short-distance ventilation, WIN Max can reach a hot air exhaust efficiency 8 times higher than that of WIN 2.  When the internal temperature is between 20 ℃ ~ 80 ℃. the BIOS can dynamically adjust the fan speed from 2700 ~ 6300 RPM based on the preset 70 temperature control levels.At the same time, the BIOS also contains three TDP (15W, 20W, 25W) schemes for gamers to choose, which helps to achieve the best energy efficiency ratio and heat dissipation effect in practical applications.  WIN Max uses Intel 10th Generation Core ™ i5-1035G7 processor. With the help of 10nm processing technology, this CPU has a transistor density of 100MTr / mm², double that of a cup using the 14nm process. Other notable features of this processor include 4-core 8-thread design, 1.2GHz reference frequency, 3.7GHz Turbo frequency, 2MB L2 cache, 6MB L3 cache, 4 GT / s OPI bus speed.How does the I5-1035G7 compare to other processors in performance? You can find out by looking at the following CPU benchmarks (PerformanceTest 9):  So how about its single-core and multi-core performance? Here are its benchmark results in CPU-Z:  The single / multi-core performance of I5-1035G7 has surpassed i7-4790K, the Intel 4th generation desktop flagship CPU, reaching a level close to that of i7-6700K. By comparison, the m3-8100Y processor used by GPD WIN 2 is quite weak in performance.  WIN Max's built-in i5-1035G7 SoC integrates the 11th-gen Iris Plus Graphics 940 which has 64 EU execution units, more than double the number of EUs in the 9.5-gen integrated graphics chips (up to 24EUs). With a base frequency of 300MHz and a maximum dynamic frequency of 1.05GHz, this display chip can perform one trillion floating-point calculations per second, 2.67 times higher than that of 9.5th-gen integrated graphics chip. Compared with the last-gen chips, this display chip has achieved a qualitative leap in performance, energy efficiency, 3D, media and gaming performance.The following table shows the performance of several mainstream graphics chips in 3DMark 11 at the resolution of 1280 × 800:  As seen from the figure above, the performance of Iris Plus Graphics 940 is slightly higher than that of GeForce MX150 (a mainstream dedicated graphics card), very close to that of GeForce MX250 and nearly 4 times higher than that of GPD WIN 2. The aforementioned benchmarking results represent performance when using the built-in screen. When using an external display, the actual performance of WIN Max in World of Warcraft, DOTA2, and LOL is as follows:

World of Warcraft: Under highest graphics settings, the game runs at the frame rate of more than 80 with 1080P resolution and 50 ~ 60 with 4K resolution (maintaining at 35 during 5V5 team battles).

DOTA2: At 4K resolution and 4 ""render quality"" levels, the game runs at the frame rate of: 60 FPS, 45 FPS, 31 FPS and 11 FPS.

LOL: At 1080P resolution and “high” graphics quality, the game runs at frame rate ranging from 60 to 95 FPS, averaging about 80 FPS.
  Memory frequency is an important factor affecting reading and writing speed and a system using high frequency memory can run games more smoothly. In the case of GPD WIN Max, 16GB of LPDDR4X 3733, the fastest low-power memory currently on the market, and dual-channel design jointly ensure that it can meet the needs of the latest games.The following table shows the memory benchmark results of LPDDR3-1866, LPDDR3-2133, LPDDR4X-2400, LPDDR4X-3200 and LPDDR4X-3733 in AIDA64:  * The results of the Read, Write and Copy tests in Aida64 were all obtained in dual-channel mode.We can see that WIN Max performs better than Surface Pro 7 which also uses LPDDR4X 3733 memory, the main reason for which is that WIN Max uses active cooling, which can effectively prevent reduction of memory frequency caused by the CPU throttling due to overheat. WIN 2 has the worst performance because its memory is not as good as the other two products.In practical applications, LPDDR4X 3733 is obviously better than other products. Taking 4K video output and gaming (League of Legends) as an example:  * Note: A 2.4GB 4K video file (with compression) and the game League of Legends were used in the tests, results will vary between platforms!  WIN Max allows users to replace the built-in SSD installed in the M.2 NVMe / AHCI dual protocol interface. However, due to space constraints, WIN Max only supports single-sided M.2 2280 SSDs (such as Samsung 970 EVO Plus) and does not support double-sided SSDs such as Lenovo NGFF SL700. Please pay attention to the distinction between the two when replacing the SSD.  WIN Max's built-in SSD has excellent read and write performance. The following table shows the SSD performance comparison between WIN Max and three products with the same configuration:  * Test software: CrystalDiskMark 6.02 x64;* Test environment: 1065G7 / 1035G7, 16GB LPDDR, 256GB / 512GB SSD;* The test results may vary slightly between different versions of CrystalDiskMark.  Heat dissipation has a significant impact on the reading and writing performance.SSDs with faster read and write speed can load games faster and make games run more smoothly. In terms of specific performance, the sequential read / write speed of WIN Max far exceeds that of other products with the same configuration (Microsoft Surface Pro 7 has the worst performance), and the gap between its read / write speeds is also smaller. In terms of 4K read and write performance, there is no clear winner among the products.  We didn't ditch the micro SDXC card slot because the machine supports large-capacity SSDs. WIN Max supports A2 Class Micro SDXC card, which features minimum random read and write IOPS of 4000/2000, and theoretical read and write speeds up to 170MB / s and 90MB / s respectively, nearly twice those of A1 class cards. At the same time, the card slot supports SD card with a maximum capacity of 2TB. The following figure shows the read and write speeds of two SanDisk micro SDXC cards:  * Notes:C10, U1, A1 Sandisk (model: SDSQUNC-128G-ZN6MA) cards tested in WIN 2 (supports A1 class cards). C10, U3, V30, A2. SanDisk (model: SDSQXA1-128G-ZN6MA) cards tested in WIN Max (supports A2 class cards).  To support 4K 60Hz video output, WIN Max ditches the processor's built-in HDMI 1.4 controller, and is instead equipped with an independent HDMI 2.0b controller that supports 18Gbps bandwidth, up to 32 audio channels, 48bit maximum color depth and HDR.Many people buy the latest HDR 4K / 60Hz monitors or TVs to watch Ultra HD Blu-ray-compliant UHD BD. However, all systems using the AMD solution and some using the Intel solutions cannot play UHD BDs with copyright restrictions. The reason is that only Intel processors that support SGX security technology can play such UHD BDs.  After understanding the reasons above, please stop using the traditional Ultra HD Blu-ray DVD players because by using WIN Max equipped with faster USB and Lan ports as well as the 1035G7 with built-in Intel SGX technology, Iris Plus Graphics 940 GPU supports FP16 HDR anti-aliasing display, supports HDR10 format and Dolby Vision, supports high quality encoder for HEVC(H.265) and VP9, supports BT2020 color gamut. Each performance can reach the standard of Sony UBP-X700 blu-ray DVD player. you can easily play online or downloaded UHD BD movies by connecting it to a 4K HDR TV via HDMI!  The best feature of WIN Max is the addition of a Thunderbolt 3 port. With the transmission rate of 40Gbps, 8 times that of USB 3.0 and 2.22 times that of HDMI 2.0b, this port can support 2 external 4K / 60Hz monitors at the same time. When playing games, WIN Max can be connected to any Thunderbolt 3 eGFX enclosure, so that the dedicated desktop graphics card (including NVIDIA graphics cards that support 3D stereo mirrors and virtual reality technology) in that enclosure can be used to further enhance the gaming experience.  * Notes: eGFX refers to a standard proposed by Intel for a complete set of external graphics solutions that covers various components such as power supply, motherboard, graphics card, and interface while eGPU only refers to the external graphics card. Currently in the retail market, eGFX products have many names, including eGPU, graphics dock, external graphics enclosure, external graphics dock and so on.In addition to using eGFX products, Thunderbolt 3, which supports ultra-high-speed two-way data transmission and 65W charging, has many other extended use cases, including:1. Using any 65W Type-C adapter to charge WIN Max.  2. To charge WIN Max when outputting high-definition video signals to any display through the USB Type-C interface. WIN Max does not need to charge through its USB Type-C charging port when connected to such external monitors, which means that WIN Max can do charging and video output at the same time with just one Thunderbolt 3 cable!  3. The Thunderbolt 3 port of WIN Max (power on) can be used to charge mobile phones, tablets and other devices charge.  4. To achieve 4K / 60Hz output through HDMI connection. Thunderbolt 3 supports simultaneous connection of two 4K / 60Hz displays through HDMI ports. 5. Support for many protocols (USB 3.1, Thunderbolt 1, Thunderbolt 2, DisplayPort, PCI express) and 40Gbps bus speed make Thunderbolt 3 the best port for various storage peripherals. For example, using Thunderbolt 3 to connect solid state drives can help the hard drives to achieve maximum read and write speeds.Real-world test shows that the read and write speeds of a connected Samsung X5 (model name: MU-PB1T0B / WW) can reach 2800MB / s and 2300MB / s respectively. * Notes: In order to achieve maximum speed, the external ssd hard drives must have built-in support for PCI-E bus.6. Due to limitation of built-in storage, many people choose to purchase public cloud space, but platforms that operate cloud storage face risks from government suppression and service provider defaults and data leakage. In this case, more and more people are starting to use NAS and use its BT and PT functions to download and backup games, Blu-ray movies, etc. and retrieve resources from the NAS through LAN or WAN connections.However, even in a gigabit LAN network environment, it still takes quite a while to copy a game with hundreds of GBs from a NAS, not to mention that many enterprises are still using 100M switches (12.5MB/s). Fortunately, with the Thunderbolt 3 port of WIN Max, you can connect 10 Gigabit network switches to achieve 10 times the transmission speed of Gigabit network.  * Notes: In order to achieve 10 times the transmission speed of Gigabit in a LAN environment, in addition to using the Thunderbolt 3 port of WIN Max to connect to a 10 gigabit ethernet converter, the router and NAS need to support 10 Gigabit transmission and NAS must have built-in PCIe NVMe SSDs paired in RAID.  GPD WIN Max supports Intel ’s latest Wi-Fi 6 (Gig +) technology that complies with the IEEE 802.11ax standard. Under 160MHz, Wi-Fi 6 can achieve single channel bandwidth up to 2402Mbps (300MB/s download speed).  Unlike SU-MIMO supported by Wi-Fi 5 (802.11ac Wave 1), MU-MIMO supported by Wi-Fi 6 has greatly improved network throughput and parallel communication capabilities. When connecting an MU-MIMO-based wireless router, the OFDMA technology with excellent parallel communication can ensure that WIN Max does not experience high network latency, even if the router is connected with many wireless devices at the same time.  The theoretical transmission speed and throughput of Wi-Fi 6 are 4 times higher than that of Wi-Fi 5, 2.4 times higher than that of current gigabit wired network and 24 times higher than the 100M wired network.In the future, WIN Max users can freely enjoy ultra-smooth cloud gaming in any Wi-Fi 6-based network environment.  With support for Bluetooth 5.0, WIN Max can connect to 7 Bluetooth devices at the same time at a transmission speed of up to 3MB/s. With Wi-Fi turned on, WIN Max can achieve indoor positioning with an accuracy of less than 1 meter. At the same time, the effective connection range of Bluetooth 5.0 is also increased to 300 meters, which means that WIN Max users can ignore the limit of 10 meters under the old specification and connect and use various Bluetooth devices in a larger range.  * Notes: Long-distance communication can only be achieved when the connected device also supports Bluetooth 5.0. It is not possible to connect two identical devices (for example, two headphones of the same specification) at the same time. The communication distance of 300 meters is a theoretical value. Most manufacturers will limit the communication distance of Bluetooth 5.0 devices to 10 meters in order to reduce power consumption. Before purchasing, please confirm whether the device supports long-distance communication.  WIN Max is equipped with a USB 3.1 Gen2 Type-C port that has a peak bandwidth of 10Gbps and a transmission speed of up to 1.21GB/s. In addition to being the product's default charging port, this full-featured port can also be used for two-way charging, video output, data transmission and other functions.WIN Max has a built-in 57Wh (rated capacity) large-capacity battery, which can be fully charged in about 2 hours by the 65W PD USB-C power adapter that comes with it. When fully charged, the machine supports 3 hours of heavy use, 6 to 8 hours of moderate use and nearly 14 hours of light use. The following table shows the battery life comparison between WIN Max and several other products with the same processor (all from official sources).  * Notes to battery life benchmarking:The test result refers to the time taken for the battery level to decrease from 100% to 0% under normal usage scenarios. Normal usage time includes active use time and standby time. The aforementioned active use refers to:(1) Browsing 8 mainstream websites by opening multiple tabs.(2) Active use of Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and Outlook to complete productivity tasks.(3) Let application software run for a period of time without manual intervention.All settings were set to default during the test, except for the following: Screen brightness (150 nits), automatic brightness adjustment (disabled) and Wi-Fi (turned on and connected). Battery life can vary significantly under different device settings, usage cases etc.In addition to charging WIN Max, the 65W adapter of the machine can also be used to charge any mobile phone, tablet, or laptop that has a USB Type-C port.  The world's smallest 65W power adapter (as small as the WIN 2 charger), you can carry it everywhere you want! Other than gaming, WIN Max is also a perfect productivity tool in the field of industry applications. For network engineers, IT operation and maintenance personnel or communications engineers, WIN Max is a universal portable mobile terminal that has enough computing power to make it the perfect substitute for traditional industrial laptop, IPCs or thin clients.  With the RJ45 port, engineers can connect WIN Max to any wired network to analyze and solve issues in various LAN, MAN and WAN networks; WIN Max can be connected with various serial devices with the help of a single USB to RS-232 cable.  After successfully launching GPD WIN 2 through crowdfunding on the Indiegogo platform we found that, although WIN 2 makes up for many shortcomings of the 1st-gen product, it still has room for improvement in areas such as performance, heat dissipation, appearance, ergonomics, etc. According to the requests of many users of the WIN series products, we started to develop this new model last year.The main reason for launching a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo is that launching WIN Max requires heavy financial investment in R & D, mold development and material procurement.

It boasts a new yet simple mechanism, is beautifully crafted from durable materials and unlike other pens can be refilled without any disassembly. Designed with longevity at its centre by an award winning design team this pen will stand the test of time.Simple Yet Innovative Design:Core turns the traditional retractable pen on its head. Instead of multiple fiddly parts Core has just two key components that slide beautifully over one another to change from the writing and retracting positions. What is more Core is one of the easiest pens on the market to refill, requiring absolutely no disassembly of the pen whatsoever. The outer anodized aluminium shell has a familiar hexagonal profile which makes it comfortable to hold and means that it won't roll away, we've also added a fine texture to the surface of the aluminium which enhances the feel and quality. The inner core features a clip, allowing you to attach the pen to workbooks, this also functions as the 'button' to operate the mechanism. How it works:Core is the outcome of a complete rethinking of a traditional retractable pen. Inspired by the classic craft knife you can simply slide the pen as it satisfyingly clicks into position, it feels like you are not only holding a premium pen but also a marvel of refined engineering in your hand. Moves like a craft knifeRefill:Core is supplied with 2 x high quality Schmidt D1 refills. This compact ballpoint is popular amongst pen enthusiasts, it writes smoothly, the ink dries fast and it is extremely reliable. We provide this in black with a medium tip size, though you will find it available in a variety of colors and tip sizes, whatever suits your style.Extremely simple to replace refill. Push firmly past writing position,+click+ and remove.Insert replacement refill, retract, +click+  done.Technical details:

</div></div>","Our team consists of people with great tech background which are part of the world’s leading Dreamweaver extensions producer DMXzone. We are part of Dynamic Zones International BV, founded in 2000. More than 17 years on the market!
Our history of innovation started with the launch of a successful international user group. The goal of this community was to share knowledge about Adobe Dreamweaver, that long-known website editor. Because of the enthusiasm of the users this group blossomed and became a network with more than 600,000 users. Currently, we are operating from two offices in Europe, located in The Netherlands and Bulgaria.


Wappler is standing for Web App Builder. We give you the opportunity to create single page applications and mobile apps without any skills!

App Connect and Server Connect, most powerful really well-known DMXzone frameworks, will be implemented as native components of Wappler, as well as Bootstrap 4 and Framework 7!
With Wappler we are opening a new way to complete freedom of extension development based on the latest web and app standards, producing clear code and empowering the modern workflows of multi-target publishing, modern web and app building and packaging workflows!

Access to Wappler beta will be delivered to all the backers ASAP. The license will be assigned for all as soon as it is officially relased.


Some of our team members joined Web Summit 2017 and announced the visual web app creator Wappler for the first time in public! Dutch cookies and a lot of marketing materials were waiting for the visitors of our stand as exhibitors. A lot of users' opinions were heard, great reactions, awesome support, as well as very important suggestions for the development of the product!




 

Absolutely. Adobe Dreamweaver is turning more and more into a tool for hardcore coders and loosing its well-known visual abilities. It's also a truth that Dreamweaver's development has being way behind the latest web or mobile app developments. Wappler is going further - where Dreamweaver hasn't gone before!
 
See what Joseph Lowery - a well known best-selling author and Dreamweaver Guru has to say about Wappler:

 

No, we aren't. Wappler is innovative, a standalone application which you can use on any OS - Windows, MacOS X or even Linux! Our product gives you the power of design - then you have freedom to use all the included components to create a professional web project or mobile application. No watermarks, no slow and lagging browsers!
Wappler is build on top of the Google Chrome platform - the latest web technologies and the powerful components from DMXzone, the most successful Dreamweaver community ever! So we know how to make the things working...
Wappler's user interface is much simpler than Wix or Webflow. And more powerful! You can choose your personal hosting provides, as well as you got access to any file or database Wappler produces. You’re making dynamic-driven websites and mobile apps… no need to code it by yourself and you got access to every single file and database in the project.
The rendering in Wappler is now the latest Chrome 64 — great speed improvements and instance rendering with the latest web technologies!
It’s not Adobe XD or InVision too: in Wappler you make dynamic projects, not mock-ups. Imagine the mock-up you designed fully functional without hiring a developer — that’s Wappler’s spirit.
Using Wappler you can directly publish your mobile apps to App Store (iOS) and Google Play Store (Android) - there's no such opportunity in other web builders!

I've been using Dreamweaver for years, but Wappler isn't just a replacement of it: Wappler is Dreamweaver's killer.Mike Hall, Web Designer
It's so easy to build web pages using Wappler! My workflow was greatly improved and now I have more free time for my family.Ben Williams, UI/UX Expert
I was looking for something more than a mockup design tool and I am really happy I found Wappler. Now I can create dynamic websites by myself without hiring back-end developers.Sasha Sukho, Graphic Designer
I love Wappler – I’ve met these guys at Web Summit 2017 and they invited me to test the application. I’m impressed and looking forward seeing it in public.Marco Silva Web Design Enthusiast
Hm… it’s simply awesome! So many extensions, it’s easy and I don’t have to spend time on looking on Google about web development. Just wait for it :)David Günter Business Owner
No more codiiiing! As a designer, I used to deal with that. But Wappler is my key to coding freedom! You’re great and improving the product constantly!Michelle van Dijk UI Designer
One of our beta testing users even wrote a whole article Bye-bye Dreamweaver, hello Wappler! Read it on his Medium blog.

We got a challenge for you! Let's prove you that Wappler can create a fully functional dynamic website in 2 minutes - starting form scratch.

<p><strong>Stop Motion Animation has been a frequent choice for Cinematic Storytelling in recent years.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The most important element for a Stop-Motion puppet is the skeleton or armature.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A puppet with mediocre skeleton is hard to work with during animation.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A Stop -Motion puppet skeleton must be stable, but lightweight at the same time.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A good puppet skeleton can be moved easly, maintaining position without changing because of settlements or subsidence. Also, it must not lose this feature after a few movements.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The right movement of the skeleton allows the puppet to assume positions that appear natural and prevents cracks or deformations in the coating materials to appear.</strong></p>

<h3>Introducing GEORGE®</h3>
<p><strong>Made from pure Carbon Fiber and high quality Stainless Steel 630, GEORGE® was created for professional stop motion animation use and applies the most advanced composite material technology.</strong></p>
<p><strong>GEORGE® is extremely durable, has great fluidity of movement, and maintains mobility over time and during filming. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The upper torso is made entirely of carbon fiber and was created in three different versions: a base, an improved reinforced section for shoulder joints, and another with a special dynamic neck.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A rapid attachment system is used for the limbs and neck, which lets you create different hands, feet, and heads whilst maintaining the same body. It's very easy to remove and replace the limb.</strong></p>

The most important element for a Stop-Motion puppet is the skeleton or armature.
A puppet with mediocre skeleton is hard to work with during animation.
A Stop -Motion puppet skeleton must be stable, but lightweight at the same time.
A good puppet skeleton can be moved easly, maintaining position without changing because of settlements or subsidence. Also, it must not lose this feature after a few movements.
The right movement of the skeleton allows the puppet to assume positions that appear natural and prevents cracks or deformations in the coating materials to appear.

 

 

 
Introducing GEORGE®
Made from pure Carbon Fiber and high quality Stainless Steel 630, GEORGE® was created for professional stop motion animation use and applies the most advanced composite material technology.
GEORGE® is extremely durable, has great fluidity of movement, and maintains mobility over time and during filming. 
The upper torso is made entirely of carbon fiber and was created in three different versions: a base, an improved reinforced section for shoulder joints, and another with a special dynamic neck.
A rapid attachment system is used for the limbs and neck, which lets you create different hands, feet, and heads whilst maintaining the same body. It's very easy to remove and replace the limb.

<h3>Frequently asked questions</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: Why can’t I use my phone for this?</p>
<p>A: You can, and it will help in some situations, but Senstone is fighting a bigger beast. One of the most surprising insights we found is that we lose our trail of thought because of tiniest distractions, which are everywhere: phone call, notification, random sign on a street, previous todo item in your notepad etc. They all trigger new associations and the new trail of thought, simply overriding the ones we had before. Senstone minimizes the time between idea popped up in your head and saved in your notepad, therefore reduces any possible distractions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: What mobile devices does Senstone work with?</p>
<p>A: Senstone works with iPhone 5s and higher on iOS 9+ and with Android 5.0 or higher. Tablets and other devices are on limited support. Please reach out to us if you'd like to use Senstone without iOS or Android smartphone.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: Can Senstone speak back to me?</p>
<p>A: No, Senstone only records your voice, and processes it on your mobile device. It’s designed to listen to you with no distractions, and we intentionally chose to leave off the speaker to keep it as small as it is.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: How many notes can I store in a cloud?</p>
<p>A: You can store as many text notes as you want, but there is a limit to their original audio recordings, as they take much more space. The basic version will allow you to store 50 hours of notes, which should be enough for 1 year of average use, but you’ll be able to use the premium version of the app for extended audio storage.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: How long can I record with Senstone?</p>
<p>A: There are three parts to this answer. First, Senstone can store up to 2.5 hours of recording when disconnected from a phone, but it uses your phone’s and cloud storage when connected, which allow many more hours. Second, the battery allows recording for about 3 hours in single charge. Third, the speech-to-text functionality has limitations on how many texts it can transcribe in the basic version of the app. Please read below for details.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: How many recordings can I make?</p>
<p>A: You can make as many recordings as you want, but there is the limitation to the number of speech-to-text transactions per month. The reason is that we’re using third party API and have to pay for each transaction. The limit we accounted for so far is 300 minute-long transactions per month(average of 10 notes per day), but we will modify this to the factual number of average daily usage. We will allow (almost) unlimited transactions for first 3 months, will measure average usage and will set the limit just above that number. Our goal is for you to not notice any limitations with average use, and provide premium subscription for heavy usage.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: What’s premium app subscription?</p>
<p>A: Premium app subscription is made for those who use Senstone very intensively and need more capabilities. It gives you much more storage in the cloud, many more speech-to-text transactions and unique features like automatic punctuation and intonation analysis. It will be charged monthly, but we haven’t yet come up with the pricing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: Can I use Senstone to transcribe speech of people around me?</p>
<p>A: Not in the first version. Currently, Senstone is a personal device and is optimized for use by a single person. Optimal distance from mouth to Senstone is 8 inches(20 cm). We can record on larger distances, but we can’t yet perform speech-to-text analysis when speakers are located further away from the device. This often includes recording lectures, meetings, or interviews. In those cases, you will have to bring Senstone close to the person speaking.</p>
<p>For this functionality our goal is to roll it our with a software update after we ship you the device, so you don't have to buy a new one. And although we can't commit yet, it is in pipeline.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: Is speech-to-text recognition quality better than Siri?</p>
<p>A: Short answer: it’s quite similar. Long answer: we tested numerous engines and with the current proprietary NLP deliver results at 95% accuracy and higher and adapting to speaker’s style over time. We are improving these results with noise reduction and additional audio processing.</p>

Just capture the things in your daily life that you don’t want to miss. It automatically converts your voice notes into text and organizes them for easy access.
We check smartphones 150 times a day, every day. But what if there was a plainly easier way to capture those precious words?Senstone lets you record your thoughts quickly and conveniently. Senstone is a notepad the size of a bottle cap. Imagine walking in the busy street or driving a car and taking those notes and reminders with the speed of thought.Tap on the Senstone to start recording and speak. Tap again and it stops. All audio and text notes are synced to the Cloud seamlessly.  Senstone saves you from getting distracted while reaching for your smartphone and looking for the necessary app. Especially when focusing is critical.

Senstone should be close when you speak — for best performance. You can hang it around your neck, clip it to your shirt collar or a jacket, or even wear it on your wrist. 
Senstone is a standalone device so you can take notes and create lists when its not connected to your smartphone. It records for up to two and a half hours when offline. Then it automatically syncs your notes in the cloud when you are back in range. Being able to take notes on the go is critical — be it your personal goals, your breakthrough ideas or your travel journal. This is why the world’s greatest writers, inventors, and visionaries kept notebooks to document their ideas. And today we offer a much more convenient and handy solution. Are you a food blogger discovering a new cafe and wanting to document your experience? Take notes in seconds with Senstone. It has been designed specifically to keep track of details in any situation. You can even capture an impromptu interview with someone at a cafe. 
  You can also use Senstone at night, but you don’t need to wear it. It listens to you when you sleep and is just a finger snap away from recording the details of your dreams while you still remember them. There’s no need to press any button. Thanks to our unique machine learning system, we help you record your midnight thoughts and dreams with just a snap of your fingers. NB: Currently, the finger snap feature is only available when the gadget is charging on its dock.  Senstone helps you stay focused, lets you organize your thoughts quickly and allows you to manage your life with confidence and style. Send reminders to other members of your team. Just say “Tom, I figured you didn’t bring lunch today, so I ordered pizza” and the message is sent.Senstone is your communication tool with others on the team. However, sometimes it is more convenient to have your thoughts laid out right in your favourite app. For these scenarios we are integrating with apps like Evernote, Trello and more. Everyone has their own sense of style. People are wearing accessories to underline their personality, get attention and feel good. We tried to be timeless and original with this device. Senstone’s design is pure and minimalist — it’s something that will match any style or look.    Our fashion designer picked the best materials for Senstone to look and feel right. The casing is made of Chrome-plated brass and clear brass. We also offer a lighter, Aluminium version anodized in white, gray and black. All models feature a scratch-proof tempered screen.Senstone’s screen consists of 17 white LEDs that inform you of key activities such as starting and ending a recording, synchronization, battery status, and charging. It’s all displayed by flashing patterns and shapes with the LED array.  We do care about the environment, so we made the box that is indisposable and reusable. This is your stylish dock that is used for charging and a sole place to store and carry Senstone and its accessories. You can use it to hold the device itself as well as all your detachable backs.

Our line of interchangeable backs was developed by a fashion designer. You can clip it to your clothes, hang it from your neck, or wear it on your wrist, for the style that suits you best. We developed our own firmware with the Protocol that works specifically with audio tracks (files). It is optimized to record and transmit high-quality audio without data loss and run them later through AI systems in the Cloud. We ensure encryption of our data so it's highly protected during data transfer over the air.  Hardware is optimized for low energy consumption which gives about 4 days of average use.The reason we've chosen the components is multilayers, among them the size. We spent several months trying to fit components into a small casing and maintain good battery life at the same time by using BLE microprocessor.Here are some technical highlights of our device.  It includes Low Power Wireless Microcontroller with the following features:1) Multi-core system, 2) Support Over-the-Air Upgrade (OTA), 3) AES-128 Security Module, 4) Compatible with BLE 4.2.Digital MEMS Microphones with the following features: 1) Three modes: Standard Performance, Low-Power and Ultrasonic Mode, 2) Frequency Range 0.01kHz - 80kHz.Memory with the following features: 1) Minimum 100,000 recording cycles, 2) 20 years of data retention.Lithium (LiPo) battery:1) 4.2 Voltage, 2) 80mAh capacity, 3) 4 days of average use. As great as a simple and convenient tap could be, we are constantly looking for more natural ways to capture your thoughts. One of them is a snap. The magic lies in the device machine learning system. The microphones are in the active listening mode, and when the captured sound matches the Snap pattern — it activates the device.

</div></div>","Review & Hands-On By Tyriel Wood - VR Tech!! ""Right away the clarity of the 5K display over here is pretty impressive!! It is impossible to spot any pixel on the screen that is projected."" --Tyriel Wood Made by Unbox Fantasy, a professional crew assemblage from the former editors of tech review media.  ~NB. I am an animated GIF - give me a second to load :-)Still tethered to the past with an old bulky head-mounted display (HDM) or backpack-sized HD monitor weighing on your mood while working or watching entertainment? You may be feeling dizzy due to the visual ‘melee attack’ of first-gen displays or bothered by curious prying eyes when watching videos in public, or feeling self-conscious like a time-traveler with a bizarre gadget strapped to your head while trying to relax with some multimedia?Get GodView and set yourself free from old technology for an incredibly immersive visual experience for fun and productivity. Whether you are a hardcore gamer, movie fanatic, or busy commuter looking for an entertainment solution, GodView is a revolutionary solution that delivers an extradimensional experience for multimedia. A next-gen wearable with a perfectly balanced super lightweight, affordable, and stylish design suitable for everyday use.~NB. I am an animated GIF - give me a second to load :-)GodView is designed as a standard-setting smart device, to bring user & budget-friendly mixed reality to life. Any content on your mobile phone can be cast wirelessly to the 300-inch virtual display in front of you.  It unveils vivid imagery before your eyes, empowering you with superb vision even more lifelike than what your eyes can show you.  ~NB. I am an animated GIF - give me a second to load :-) High ResolutionGodView serves as a match for a professional monitor with a resolution of 2*2560*2560 (5K) that is sharp enough to eliminate ghosting, graininess, or optical grating, which allows you to experience visual details you can’t see with typical displays.3650 PPI See-Through Demo: 
 Large Display Size & FOV GodView creates a massive 300’’ virtual display with a binocular 110-degree wide field of view (FOV) that naturally merges virtual details into the real-world viewed through the lens, for an incredibly immersive experience.~NB. I am an animated GIF - give me a second to load :-)
 

 
​ High Refresh Rate & Brightness

GodView supports a 90Hz refresh rate so the images you see are always extremely smooth without visible flickering, and with a brightness up to 2000 nits, the display is ultra-clear even in bright daylight. 

 
​Myopia Adaptability
If you wear glasses, it’s time to put them aside! GodView can self-tune its clarity for myopia of -8~0D, which means near-sighted users can see clearly and comfortably without wearing their everyday glasses or contacts. (Offered as an optional function in addition to the standard model). By continuously controlling the change of focal length, the eye can be trained to achieve the purpose of adjusting myopia. Holographic optics change and adjust the focal length automatically according to an advanced algorithm.
~NB. I am an animated GIF - give me a second to load :-)
GodView opts for a sunglasses-like design without a heavy battery or processor on-board so they remain stylish and comfortable for extended use. Super lightweight and cable-free connectivity make them effortlessly wearable. Without the distraction of cords or a bulky headset, you can indulge yourself completely with ‘God’s view’ and enjoy the best visuals.

  Why Super Waveguide 
GodView utilizes the super waveguide optical solution made of lightweight resin. This innovation transforms the conventional head-mounted display into an everyday fashion item weighing just 55g, less than 1/10 of Microsoft HoloLens. 
 Wi-Fi Connectivity 
GodView achieves its unique lightweight performance without a heavy battery or processor onboard. It uses a compact Wi-Fi 6 bridge housing a power supply that can work continuously for over 4 hours and any multimedia on your smartphone can be cast wirelessly to the GodView virtual display in front of your eyes. It’s the ultimate high definition visual experience at home or on the go.

(Before you answer, remember you are under oath). The original legal pad design hasn’t been revisited since 1888! No wonder it’s the 21st century and the most widely-used writing surface can’t connect to the digital universe and is a doomsday device for trees.  

Legal pad users everywhere should be held in contempt! Until now. The Rocketbook Orbit is an endlessly reusable, customizable, cloud-connected pen and paper notepad.   


 
 
 
 
 
 

Magnets + Modularity = Magic! The Orbit utilizes customized “Page Packs” that can be removed from the pad! Our new technology uses a magnetic base and has stainless steel rings attached to every pack of Rocketbook pages that can be lifted off the Orbit, flipped 360 degrees, and changed out for a brand new mission.    

For your core mission, we’ll equip you with a Page Pack so you can write and sketch at the speed of light, then flip the page for your next objective. A standard lined / dot-grid combo Page Pack is included! But what about other page templates to fulfill all your handwritten needs, like planning the future, conquering your tasks, or writing a fierce space ballad? We’ve got you covered at every phase.

 


The Orbit uses patented Rocketbook reusable pen and paper technology and is forged with a hard plastic composite with a textured synthetic outer layer so the vessel that protects your notes will last for lightyears to come.   

What is your favorite force in the Universe? Ours is magnetism, which is why we designed the world’s first magnetic binding system. Orbit “Page Packs” are bound with ferrous metal rings and stick to a magnetic pad. That also means the entire Orbit happens to stick to your fridge. 
  
 
Rocketbook’s patented technology means the Rocketbook Orbit is designed for endless reusability. First, use any Pilot FriXion product on your Rocketbook Orbit pages for a traditional handwriting experience. Then, simply use a damp cloth to wipe your pages clean again and again! We’re including a Rocketbook microfiber towel for truly advanced erasing capabilities.   Did you know you will consume an entire tree with an average lifetime use of legal pads? Don’t be a weapon of mass tree destruction. It’s not cool for our planet … not to mention that ordinary, one-use legal pads just don’t look cool. Rocketbook’s mission is to eliminate all the boring and wasteful single-use writing products from the galaxy (don’t believe us? We blogged about it … so yea, it’s pretty legit).      Make no mistake, the Rocketbook Orbit doesn’t only exist in the analog world! First, use your Rocketbook Orbit and Pilot FriXion pen to jot down your notes and big ideas. Then download the free Rocketbook app. When you scan your pages with the app, the space-age machine vision will “see” your handwriting and quickly capture your notes from any angle.       The free Rocketbook app will instantly adjust and visually enhance your notepad scans to ensure the digital version is light years ahead of the real thing.        In the app, you can also assign 7 shortcut symbols to ""destinations"" in the cloud. These destinations can be a folder inside Dropbox, Evernote, Google Docs, an email address, and many other popular services. Control the internet with your pen. Use these 7 shortcut destinations to send your notes, diagrams, and big ideas to the cloud at the speed of light! You can even send to shared folders that your teammates have access to!     The Rocketbook app can even transcribe your handwriting with OCR or “Optical Character Recognition” technology. Transcription allows you to send a digital text version of your notes without ever having to type a single word. OCR also gives you the power to search through all your scans with keywords and phrases. You can even auto-name your files by using the special Smart Title Bar at the top of every Orbit page.

The experience is heightened by highlighted by 2500 ANSI lumens of brightness, 2000:1 contrast ratio, BT.2020 wide color gamut and HDR 10 support. Every scene comes alive with fine details, realistic colors, and deep blacks. Tri-Color laser technology allows Polaris to blend different proportions of red, green and blue light from 3 individually calibrated light sources. This covers 193% NTSC and is able to express vivid pictures with precise color accuracy and incredible contrast. The result is significantly more impressive than conventional projectors that make use of DLP, laser and dual laser technology.With an incredible 8.3 million pixels (3840 x 2160) and equipped with high-end Ricoh lenses, the Polaris 4K laser TV delivers staggeringly crisp images with optimized colors and four times the number of pixels compared to standard HD. The projected screen size can range between 100 inches and a massive 200 inches. The Bomaker Polaris 4K Laser TV can be positioned at the center-point of a room just like a TV and project a display up to 200"" at an ultra-short distance of just 31 inches to the display surface, or 100"" from just 10 inches away. Because the projector can be placed so close to a wall, shadows won’t obstruct the screen and you'll always get a clear view no matter where you sit.Bomaker Polaris 4K offers peak brightness of 2500 ANSI lumens, which can effectively restrain the influence of living room ceiling lights or ambient light. This guarantees unmatched brightness and clarity even in well-lit rooms.Equipped with MEMC motion compensation technology: Polaris 4K intelligently creates and inserts extra frames into the original footage by calculating the minute differences between existing frames. This increases the frame rate and produces silky-smooth action no matter what you're watching. This kind of laser projector works by reflecting the light indirectly off a flat surface, rather than beaming the light directly into your eyes like a normal TV. This means it's far less straining on the eyes during prolonged viewing.Polaris 4K has the ability to sense the distance of objects, and built-in sensors automatically reduce the brightness when it detects people are very near.With built-in hi-fi quality speakers and Dolby DTS technologies, you’re fully immersed in 3-dimensional audio that envelops you with pinpoint precision. Whether a jet zooms overhead or a torrential downpour erupts, the true-to-life sound makes you feel like you’re inside the action.With a built-in 3GB of RAM, 32GB internal storage, and a Mstar 6A-838 1.7GHz CPU, the Polaris 4K Laser TV offers a completely smooth experience even at the highest resolution. Using the latest High Dynamic Range (HDR 10) display technology, Polaris is able to deliver brighter whites and black levels. Bright scenes appear crisp and clear, while dark scenes remain detailed with deep blacks.Polaris 4K laser TV runs at just 185W, the lowest power consumption among comparable products and around 45% lower than conventional projectors. When you consider that over 1 million projectors are manufactured and sold every year, this technology has the potential to save huge amounts of energy.You'll forget that the projector is even in the room due to the advanced air discharge system. Bomaker’s whisper-quiet fan emits only 25dB during show time, meaning atmospheric quiet scenes retain their eerie silence without distraction.With longer lasting laser light source technology, Polaris delivers outstanding brightness and up to 30,000 hours of playback, maintaining stunning image and color quality throughout the lifespan. This is up to 10 times longer than a regular UHP lamp, so you can enjoy at least 15,000 movies.The wireless mirroring uses Miracast® to project content from your mobile device onto a large screen. You can easily access all of your games, photos, videos and other applications on the big screen straight from your smartphone. It can also be paired with Bluetooth-enabled audio products, and supports many other common connectivity options. All you need to do is walk in, tap a few buttons, and your phone display will be 200 inches wide.You can use the projector from almost any position, including from a table top near your viewing surface with minimal installation work and without special cabling. It's also possible to mount it to the ceiling for a more discreet option. Whichever you choose, you'll be assured of breathtaking cinematic quality.A white wall is all you need. The Polaris 4K Laser TV simplifies home entertainment by providing vivid pictures without needing to take up space with a large permanent screen.Features HDMI ports, USB ports, RCA inputs, Bluetooth support, built-in WiFi capability, ethernet input, and more. You’ll have everything you need to get all your entertainment connected - no matter the format!Polaris sophisticated and stylish design is inspired to luxuriously and seamlessly blend into your living room space. It is a perfect combination of minimalist design and superior engineering.Prototype Draft:3D Modeling:Prototype:

Rotrics DexArm is the first versatile desktop robot arm with extreme 0.05mm high repeatability. Designed for makers, designers and anyone who wants to make meaningful things on their desktop! Easily do laser engraving and cutting, 3D printing and much more! Build for makers and designers to bring their ideas to life, DexArm’s functional modular design is aimed to complete any task from simply grasping, drawing to 3D printing and laser engraving.   The decelerator is the core of a robotic arm, our patented decelerator design reduces the gap between gears, allowing 0.05mm extremely high repeatability. Empower the capacity for high precision laser engraving, 3d printing even lightweight industrial applications.We hate handling screws and cables when using an intelligent product. That's why we creatively pack every function into a module to remove the unwanted screws on the end effector. Switch out modules in just one click!Rotrics DexArm gives you an intuitive and interactive way to control and bring your ideas in just a few clicks with our software. To keep DexArm easy-to-use, we integrated Blockly into our software, which allows dragging and placing the code blocks to control Rotrics. Control a robot arm is as easy as play a board game.We also provide an API for experienced developers to control Rotrics DexArm in Processing, Python, and G-code.  To make controlling Rotrics DexArm even easier, we designed the 3.5-inch touchscreen allows you to check the status and command Rotrics DexArm within your hand.  Download the G-code files to the SD card and start drawing/engraving/printing. No need to keep connecting to your computer.


With the pen holder module, Rotrics DexArm can write a beautiful hand-writing letter and draw an artistic picture, Bring arts to your home or write your homework.

  Rotrics DexArm can be easily transformed into a laser engraver with the laser engraving module. It is capable of engraving on wood, leather, paper, and other materials. You can make a meaningful gift for your friends within a few minutes. 
New 3D Printing Module
With DexArm's high precision, you can print a 3D object with the 3D printing module. The build volume of DexArm is bigger than 220x220x250mm so you can print some big model at once. Picking and placing objects can be easily performed with the help of a suction cup and soft gripper.  Perfect for lightweight industrial applications.Don’t know how to program? No worries. With the multi-function button on the base or the touchscreen, you can drag the arm and record the movements and make DexArm repeat the movements. Drag, record, and play - just that easy. With the other accessories such as computer vision kit and linear rails, we can bring the capability of DexArm to the next level. You can also design your own accessories for your targeted application.

They're Just Way Overpriced” by Laptop MagazineWe couldn’t agree more. If you’ve ever tried to find a decent laptop for under $300, you’ll know the problem. Most laptops that are available for this price lack quality and are made poorly. At the other end of the scale, the large, high spec and premium laptop brands will cost you over $800.Yes, you read that table right. The regular price for most 7” to 13” laptops is between $500 and $1000. Not the kind of money most people have spare.But we want most people to be able to afford Peakago, which is why you can get our high quality, high specification laptop for just $279. That might seem an unreal price but it’s definitely for real! It’s always been our ambition to create brilliant tech for great value for money prices that everyone can afford. We’ve been developing innovative computer technology for over 10 years, having worked on OEM and ODM projects for major brands. Then we decided to build our own brand where we could offer great performing products direct to customers for less.We’re delighted to work in partnership withWe sell direct to customers from our factory, so we save money on sales channel fees and advertising costs, passing on these savings to you, our customers, in the form of lower product prices.That’s not to say that we can afford to be selling something as advanced as Peakago for the great value price we’re offering here forever. All good things come to an end, so be sure to get your Peakago at this amazing price while you can! Like now!. Peakago measures-up at 181mm x 113.6mm x 19.6mm. That makes it incredibly light and easy to carry around wherever your work takes you.Use it on the train and the plane. The bus, in the park, hotel or coffee shop.It fits into pockets or bags like a paperback book (remember those?). So you’ll barely notice it’s there when you’re carrying it around. Imagine, no more strain on your back, arms or shoulders like you get when you try and carry some laptops around.Peakago’s built-in 4G connectivity lets you check and send emails, update your Facebook status, find out the sports scores, stream Netflix and movies wherever you may go.If work takes you somewhere with a dodgy WiFi connection, Peakago’s 4G module means you needn’t be without the internet, as it will give you a stable connection wherever you are, so the work or movie-watching can go on, while others without Peakago get frustrated by their loss of WiFi.Smartphones and tablets are great, but they’re not the most work-friendly devices. Peakago is just as portable but way more convenient for getting important jobs done as it features Windows 10s*. So whether you need to prep a presentation, edit a document, or design a whole brochure from scratch, you can do it all using MS Office software with Peakago. And typing is so much easier on Peakago compared to your smartphone as there’s a real keyboard.*Upgrading to the full Windows 10 version is easy. Just head over to the Windows Store. There’s no compromising on anything with Peakago, especially the quality of the screen image. Enjoy eye-catching colors and 178º wide viewing angles, so if you’re showing someone else what’s on your screen, they can see easily and enjoy the accurate color rendering. The lack of ports that allow universal connectivity is one of the shortcomings of using phones and tablets for work. Peakago overcomes this, by providing those ports so you can easily:
Copy files
See your presentations on projectors
Access the internet anywhere

The first generation of ESC Keyboard Stand was introduced to the market in 2018, since then we have received a tremendous amount of valuable feedback from current users on how the ESC Keyboard Stand helps in their daily typing comfort,  how it aids the body from unnecessary neck and shoulder issues that can seriously affect health and productivity.This is probably the #1 question you might have on your mind, and the short answer is YES for 98% of our customers! Simply put, this is because ergonomics are very subjective, only the user can determine the most comfortable angle for themselves.  That's why ESC Flip PRO now offers 4 adjustment levels for you to find your most comfortable angle.Both of our previous ESC Keyboard Stand models are the #1 customer choice for ""Keyboard Stand"" & ""Keyboard Stand For Desk"",  but we wanted to do even better! When reading the feedback from our customers we noticed that they asked for more adjustment and stability for full-sized keyboards. We knew we had to do something about it!Here we are on Indiegogo - Introducing the ESC Flip PRO Keyboard Stand.It is an extendable keyboard stand that fits a small to full-sized keyboard while offering stability and comfort for every size keyboard.Fits Most Small to Full-Sized KeyboardThe new ESC Flip PRO provides improved stability for full-sized keyboards. With its adjustable width, now gamers, professionals, keyboard enthusiasts, and everyone can enjoy the ultimate keyboard productivity tool! While you are using your preferred compact or large mechanical keyboard, the ESC Flip PRO supports and enhances your typing experience with its sturdy construction. Made with premium materials, it provides you with 4 different height adjustments for your continued and ever-changing typing comfort requirements. Depending on the ESC Flip PRO's placement on the back of your keyboard, Flip PRO allows you to fine-tune your ergonomic angle for your best typing posture.Reposition-able (Positive & Negative Tilt)No other Keyboard Stand on the market provides you with the flexibility to adjust angles to your comfort level like the ESC Flip PRO keyboard gives you. Don’t settle for an uncomfortable angle ever again! ESC Flip PRO gives you the flexibility to adjust your keyboard to your most comfortable angle with its 4 adjustment levels - just Flip to your desired angle!Universal CompatibilitySick of your flimsy keyboard adjustment legs that constantly collapse? Most built-in feet on keyboards break easily, and they are not stable for heavy-handed typing. ESC Flip PRO is constructed with sturdy Nylon material that gives your keyboard rock-solid, stable support at the angle you choose. Also important, this simple, sturdy design comes with non-slip feet that grip onto any desk surface and keep your keyboard in the position you like, without excess sliding around. It helps deliver consistency for your typing!Keyboard Weight: 5.5 pounds (2.5kg)Keyboard Size: 108-key Full Size with number padKeyboard Lenth: 17.7 in (45cm)ESC Flip PRO provides strong stability and keeps it from sliding even when you strike the keys at the corner hard. Say bye to your wobbly keyboard! Replacement Feet: If you really like your keyboard, but your current flimsy built-in feet are broken, instead of using a book, binder, rubber stoppers, other keyboard stands, ESC Keyboard Stand is an excellent solution to this problem. No Built-in Feet: Do you own a keyboard that doe not offer any angle adjustment such as Apple wireless Magic Keyboard, Kinesis Advantage 2, Logitech MX Keys or Logitech K780?  Now you can upgrade your existing keyboard to a new level of comfort with the ESC Flip PRO.Do not limit the use of ESC Flip PRO on your keyboard! It is compatible with laptop, iPad, and almost everything with a clean and flat surface. Let's get you an angle so everything is at your most comfortable height!Super Micro-suction GripForget about those bulky keyboard stands your friends told you about, ESC Flip PRO takes up virtually no additional space on your desk, and it will not scratch or scuff your desk or damage your expensive keyboard.Simply set it and forget that it is even there!The ESC Flip PRO’s super portable and ingenious design gives you the flexibility to fold and store for travel.

A strain gauge is a miniature device that measures strain on an object or surface. Zoomed in, the strain gauge is placed on the surface of a measurable object. When force is applied, the object bends slightly, which changes the length of the strain gauge. This causes a measurable change in its electrical current, which is then calculated and sent as a power value by the meter. </p><p>There are different types of strain gauges. Typically, the ones inside power meters are hand-glued, causing every power meter to be different from the next. They must therefore be compensated by extensive calibration and complex software. This makes power meters difficult to mass-produce and expensive and shows why some - who underestimate these complexities - do not succeed! <br/><br/>Our thin film strain gauge is of an entirely different caliber. Instead of being hand-glued, it requires no human interaction because it is directly deposited on the surface of the part, molecularly bonded and trimmed by laser. All our strain gauges are exactly the same when they come out the production process. It's a revolutionary technology used in situations with zero error tolerance, such as in medical, military and harsh environments. </p><p> <img alt=""4-IQ2-Strain-gauge-complete.gif"" border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s1.gifyu.com/images/4-IQ2-Strain-gauge-complete.gif"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1523866616/jhb3nd3frz0jp0fjjxlk.png"" src=""""/></p><p>So, how did we do it?

The main reason current power meters are so expensive is because of the use of conventional strain gauges. Every power meter that comes out of production is different and needs extensive calibration and complex software for compensation. The iQsquare power meter is equipped with a thin film strain gauge, which is directly deposited on the titanium adapter and is molecularly bonded to the surface. This is a highly accurate and fully automated process which results in absolutely identical power meters during production.</p><p>2. Every current power meter replaces a part of the bicycle, whether it is a pedal, crank arm, crank set, spider or hub. The customer needs to buy a part he or she already owns.</p><p>3. Because of the attractive price, the power meter is affordable for every cyclist. This substantially increases production quantities, lowering the price of purchased components and justifying the use of fully automated production techniques.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1527238725/pfxncie0xsqdiek2pwsv.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Let us first explain what the Q factor means. The Q factor is the horizontal distance between the two crank arms on your bicycle.</p><p>The iQsquare Power Meter enlarges the Q factor with 16mm per side.</p><p>The next question arises: what is your ideal Q factor? The ideal Q factor is anatomically determined by the distance between your hip joints. Unless you've had an extensive bike fitting including Q factor adjustment, you are probably riding with a Q factor that is either too small or too wide.</p><p>The majority of people does not notice the difference in Q factor between, for example, a road bike (146mm ~ 171mm) and a mountain bike (163mm ~ 196mm).</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1527238739/dxyklc70htyir74iagg3.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Technically, yes, you can do this. However, if you order a one-sided power meter, you automatically receive a spacer for the other side to even out the Q factor. This increases by 16mm per side. If you order the L + R set, you do not receive a spacer. If you then mount the L power meter on one bike and R power meter on the other, you will not have a symmetrical spacing of the pedals.</p><p>We recommend using the L + R power meter on one bike.

This causes a measurable change in its electrical current, which is then calculated and sent as a power value by the meter. There are different types of strain gauges. Typically, the ones inside power meters are hand-glued, causing every power meter to be different from the next. They must therefore be compensated by extensive calibration and complex software. This makes power meters difficult to mass-produce and expensive and shows why some - who underestimate these complexities - do not succeed! Our thin film strain gauge is of an entirely different caliber. Instead of being hand-glued, it requires no human interaction because it is directly deposited on the surface of the part, molecularly bonded and trimmed by laser. All our strain gauges are exactly the same when they come out the production process. It's a revolutionary technology used in situations with zero error tolerance, such as in medical, military and harsh environments.   So, how did we do it? First, we analyzed the different types of strain gauges that cause the typical high price of power meters. Second, we did an inventory on the drawbacks of each placement location on a bike. Third, we researched which benefits cyclists are actually looking for when deciding on a power meter. Putting these three factors together, we arrived at the following comparative matrix.   The team at IQ² put effort into designing a device that is easy to attach and detach on your bike. We did this because as cyclists, sometimes we swap bikes for different terrains and conditions. With our power meter, you can always swap bikes without saying goodbye to its training benefits.    It has taken us various cycles of theorizing, designing and testing before we arrived at our final product. Our power meter is a joint effort by IQ² product developers and electrical engineers and our production specialists abroad. In this year and a half process, we managed to identify our final manufacturing partners in The Netherlands and England. Upon a successful Kickstarter campaign, we are ready to move ahead and prepare production  quickly and efficiently. This way, we'll be shipping in no time.   See what cylists said about the IQ² power meter.     So, you backed us on Indiegogo and ordered your product(s). What happens next? Find our timeline below. Also, feel free to post your questions in the comment section and we’re happy to answer them for you.  The people behind the IQ² power meter are driven and passionate individuals who are good at what they do.

We would like to invite you, Indiegogo community and cycling enthusiasts, to back our project and get your own high quality IQ² power meter delivered to your doorstep. Our goal is €100.000 within 30 days. We would be absolutely thrilled to be able to have your support and disrupt the global power meter market.   We at iQsquare are able to manufacture the power meter at such an affordable price because of the following reasons:1. The main reason current power meters are so expensive is because of the use of conventional strain gauges. Every power meter that comes out of production is different and needs extensive calibration and complex software for compensation. The iQsquare power meter is equipped with a thin film strain gauge, which is directly deposited on the titanium adapter and is molecularly bonded to the surface. This is a highly accurate and fully automated process which results in absolutely identical power meters during production.2. Every current power meter replaces a part of the bicycle, whether it is a pedal, crank arm, crank set, spider or hub. The customer needs to buy a part he or she already owns.3. Because of the attractive price, the power meter is affordable for every cyclist. This substantially increases production quantities, lowering the price of purchased components and justifying the use of fully automated production techniques. Let us first explain what the Q factor means. The Q factor is the horizontal distance between the two crank arms on your bicycle.The iQsquare Power Meter enlarges the Q factor with 16mm per side.The next question arises: what is your ideal Q factor? The ideal Q factor is anatomically determined by the distance between your hip joints. Unless you've had an extensive bike fitting including Q factor adjustment, you are probably riding with a Q factor that is either too small or too wide.The majority of people does not notice the difference in Q factor between, for example, a road bike (146mm ~ 171mm) and a mountain bike (163mm ~ 196mm). Technically, yes, you can do this. However, if you order a one-sided power meter, you automatically receive a spacer for the other side to even out the Q factor. This increases by 16mm per side. If you order the L + R set, you do not receive a spacer. If you then mount the L power meter on one bike and R power meter on the other, you will not have a symmetrical spacing of the pedals.We recommend using the L + R power meter on one bike. We made the process of swapping extremely easy, which you can find as a video in our prototype gallery. After thoroughly examining all possible locations on the bicycle, the place between the pedal and the crank arm is the most versatile and producible for the lowest price. This combination gives every cyclist the opportunity to use a power meter on every bike he or she owns. A single-sided power meter measures the power produced by one leg and multiplies the measurement by two. This is a good solution for your budget, however it is very common to have a difference in produced power between the left and right leg, which lies in the range of 5 - 20%, resulting in a large measurement error. This measurement fault is not so important when comparing your own results, but comparing power data with other riders can be misleading. Therefore, it is recommended to use a double-sided power meter for a precise measurement. The iQsquare power meter is designed to swap between bikes very easily.The procedure to switch between bikes is as follows:Assume bike A currently holds the power meter and bike B is the bike you wish to swap to.1. Loosen the power meter screw on bike A and take off the power meter + pedal combination.2. Make sure a heli coil is correctly installed using the heli coil install tool inside the crank arm of bike B.3. Place the power meter + pedal combination on bike B.4. Fasten the power meter screw on bike B.5. If the crank length of bike A and bike B are different: open the iQsquare configuration app and choose 'switch bikes'. Then choose 'bike B' and the configuration of the iQsquare power meter is changed to bike B.6. Happy riding. The crank length is measured between the midpoint of the crank axle and the midpoint of the pedal spindle.In most cases the crank length is also printed on the crank arm. Common crank lengths range between 160 and 177,5mm. When installing the iQsquare power meter for the first time on your bike, the iQsquare configuration app helps setting up your power meter step by step.The only thing the app asks you to do during install is:1. Choose between the 'left-only', the 'right-only' or the 'both sides' power meter setup. 2. Name your bike 3. Fill in your bike crank length 4. Install the iQsquare power meter between your pedal and crank 5. Hit the 'pair' button The iQsquare power meter transmits the following data to your bike computer or smartphone:- Total power - Left/Right balance (when using left and right power meter) - Torque effectiveness - Pedal smoothness - Cadence First wake up the iQsquare power meter by turning the crank arm at least a half a revolution.Check if the iQsquare power meter is awake by checking the green blinking LED.Consult the user manual of your bike computer or cycling app for the steps needed to pair the power meter to your bike computer or smartphone. The iQsquare power meter is equipped with an easy accessible battery compartment and a battery cap with a zigzag profile edge.For opening the battery compartment, turn the battery cap counter clockwise by hand until the battery cap is separated from the power meter.Replace the empty battery by a new 3V CR2032 Lithium coin cell.When the battery is placed inside the battery compartment, the positive side must be visible on top.Close the battery compartment by turning the battery cap clockwise until you feel the lock engaging. The status LEDs of the iQsquare Power Meter give you the following information:Low battery Left and right power meter paired Transmitting Bluetooth Transmitting ANT+ Error Yes, if you buy a left-only or right-only power meter, you will also receive a spacer for the other side, so the distance between the pedals are evenly divided. The rider's weight limit for the iQsquare power meter is 110kg. The iQsquare power meter is constructed to withstand the forces that are being generated during a mountain bike ride.Because a power meter is a precision measuring device, a rider's weight limit of 110kg is applied and damage caused by abusive use is out of warranty.",54.0,0,"1 Campaign

Digital reading devices such as Kindle replicate the paper-reading experience but lack the ability to do more. What if you need to read notes and research papers in color? And what should I use to read comics and newspapers? Black and white are boring, how can we get some color?
  
  
 
Reinkstone R1 is the world’s first & thinnest book-sized color E-Paper Android tablet. With 140 color PPI, it has the highest color display among all color E-paper devices. It is perfectly designed for reading, writing, working, and entertainment while providing users the best eye protection.
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 

 
 Reading Front Light 
With the Reinkstone Natural Low Light Technology, you can comfortably read anytime and anywhere. No matter if it's under sunlight or at night, you won’t need to endure the eye strain of reading with electronic devices or the inconvenience of paper books.
 

 
 Sleek Design 
With a vertical notebook design only 0.68cm thick, Reinkstone makes reading and writing easier and more comfortable in any position and it’s lightweight and slim for travel.
 

 
 Long Battery Life 
Its thin, powerful, large capacity 4500mAh battery gives Reinkstone 100 days standby time/300 hours working time on a single charge. Read more, do more, and say goodbye to battery anxiety.
 

 
 
 Unlimited Formats 
With support for unlimited formats and searchable files, Reinkstone makes the perfect media library for users who want the pleasure of paper-realistic reading without the inconvenience of traditional books.
 

  
 
 Effortless Input 
4096 Level pressured Stylus with eraser and EMR layer gives you a paper-like writing experience. Taking notes and signing documents has never been easier. Don’t feel like jotting it down? Voice record meetings and notes with the R1’s double noise-reduction MIC to capture it all.
 

 
 
Faster Sharing
Convert handwritten notes into text with one click. Share your notes with others in a single click via Wi-Fi,Bluetooth, OTG, or screencast.
 

 
 

 
 DES New Color E-Paper
DES is a new display electronic slurry module that adopts a novel display structure. It is completely different from the existing micro cup structure and micro capsule structure. This structure forms a layer of a cofferdam on the surface of the TFT which makes the microstructure invisible from the front side and reduces the number of layers. It thereby obtains a higher definition and higher resolution display than previous generations of color E-paper
 

 
 Better Performance 
1.8GHz 4 Core processor with 4GB RAM & 64GB ROM makes reading and writing effortless. Need more storage room? Reinkstone R1 supports OTG to expand its memory.
 
 
 
Besides the unparalleled reading experience, Reinkstone is also a fully functional Android 11 tablet with upgradable operating system, allowing you to install the APPs you need. One Reinkstone is all you need for study, work, and entertainment.
 
 
 

Protect Their Eyes 
Reinkstone's DES E-paper screen is the best in protecting our users’ eyes. It allows your children to read comics, manga, or any books harmlessly without distraction or eye fatigue.
 
  

Best For Audiobooks 
According to the Audio Publishers Association, audiobooks help “build and enhance vital literacy skills such as fluency, vocabulary, language acquisition, pronunciation, phonemic awareness, and comprehension—skills that often boost reading scores.”
Reinkstone R1's double BOX speaker makes it the best audiobook reader while providing both you and your children some personal time.  
 
  
 Inspire Their Talent 
“Color is a power which directly influences the soul.” By Wassily Kandinsky. Don’t let black and white limit their talent and possibilities. R1 is here to help expand and record children’s colorful imaginations.   
 
  

 
 Be a Reinkstone user, reduce your carbon footprints with one simple decision. 
According to The Eco Guide, “In 2008 alone, the publishing industry was responsible for the harvest of nearly 125 million trees.” Using an E-reader that can hold thousands of books saves paper, saves trees, and helps save the planet.（More Details）

<p><span>1. Air Mouse Mode:</span></p>
<p>Wear it on your finger while doing various activities and control your device from long distances anytime, anywhere for precise control.</p>
<p><span>2. Gesture Mode:</span></p>
<p>Allows you to control your devices through gestures. There are 8 preset gestures that can execute your preferred commands. Our machine learning algorithm can learn your preferred gestures to allow for better control.</p>
<p><span>3. Joystick mode:</span></p>
<p>Once the Snowl ring is placed inside its charging cradle, it can be used as a joystick mouse and perform the same functions that a traditional mouse can.</p>

Rose Gold/Chrome color ring add-on




 
Snowl is a wearable ring-shaped device that brings 3D range of motion to devices that are traditionally 2D such as touch screens and computer mice. With Snowl, you can experience precision control over your favorite devices through three motion tracking modes: Air Mouse mode, Gesture Mouse mode Joystick Mouse mode.




Snowl has the functionality of a mouse and a touchpad for Human Interface, useful for presentations through a Gesture Interface and acts as a VR controller through a Virtual interface. All of these interfaces are combined into one small device.

 Organically learns the natural gestures of your hand movements and tracks your finger gestures. While it replaces the traditional mice, it also makes it easy to control various devices, including tablet computers, smartphones and smart TVs. And since it's worn as a ring you can perform a variety of actions.



Snowl allows you to play a variety of smartphone games on the big screen and thanks to its core technology, it'll feel like you're in experiencing virtual reality.

With snowl, you can play life-size Among Us. Connect Snowl with your phone and project the phone screen on a bigger screen using an HDMI cable. Then enjoy running around completing tasks on a TV screen. Or be an Impostor, sabotage the ship, sneak through vents, and kill off the crewmates with simple gestures!



BlueTooth pairing can be done without a separate receiver.



Snowl can pair with multiple devices via Bluetooth, allowing you to switch between devices effortlessly, including Android phones and Windows PCs.
 



The Snowl charging cradle not only acts as a charging case, but it can even be used as a joystick mouse. The ergonomic design of the joystick mouse form factor reduces wrist fatigue. 

If you put the Snowl ring inside of the charging cradle and switch it to the joystick mouse mode, you'll have access to the right click, left click, and scroll functions.

There are eight preset default gestures that you can use freely. But through the machining learning algorithm, Snowl will record and learn your gestures as well as the commands you want each gesture to perform.
 



When you touch and hold the center of the touch bar for 2 second without moving your finger, Snowl changes from the air-mouse mode to the gesture-mouse mode.






1. Air Mouse Mode:
Wear it on your finger while doing various activities and control your device from long distances anytime, anywhere for precise control.
2. Gesture Mode:
Allows you to control your devices through gestures. There are 8 preset gestures that can execute your preferred commands. Our machine learning algorithm can learn your preferred gestures to allow for better control.
3. Joystick mode:
Once the Snowl ring is placed inside its charging cradle, it can be used as a joystick mouse and perform the same functions that a traditional mouse can.



 
Our company, CoxSpace, has developed a gesture machine learning engine that learns your gestures over time and allows you to define the command for each gesture set. That means that you can use the gestures that are most natural to you while using Snowl so that it's convenient anytime, anywhere. •Real time Processing for No latency
•Distributed Processing for Dual Core
•Gesture Machine Learning Engine is integrated in Device
•Gesture Prediction
•Gesture Analysis
•Next Generation 9DoF solution integration All technology is programed by COXSpace



Record 8 custom gestures and select what you want those gestures to do when they are executed.




Snowl has the highest performing 3D spatial coordinate solution in existence with the next generation 9DoF technology. Snowl is integrated the latest sensor fusion processor with 3-axis gyroscope, a 3-axis accelerometer and Magnetometer.
 




COX Space has developed a special technique for measuring distance in three-dimensional (3D)space which has a 3cm resolution at this moment.

Simply put it into the coffee filter basket, add water and start pumping, the espresso will come out directly into the cup below. In addition to providing espresso, STARESSO MINI is equipped with a pressurized filter perfect for frothing milk when you feel like a cappuccino or latte.There are two measure marks on the water chamber to indicate the maximum water levels for making Espresso and Americano. Add water to the 50ml mark to get 25~30ml Espresso and the 80ml mark to get 55ml or more Americano. The durability of STARESSO MINI is tripled to over 100,000 times of pumping by the aircraft-grade nanoceramics coating on the surface of the pump. It is extremely sturdy and long-lasting to outlive other coffee makers and be your most trust-worthy personal barista whenever needed. STARESSO MINI is approved by FDA in U.S. and has earned certifications from equivalent agencies in many other countries like Japan and Korea.

Over time, it develops a natural patina. A naturally developed patina is the soft sheen that develops on the surface of the leather, imparting a character to the product. A patina on the leather is like the hallmark of a high-quality leather good. The Tamponata effect is like the natural Patina, given to the leather at the start.</p><p>Tamponata is a type of <strong>hand-finishing</strong> done on leather, where the color is applied with a soft pressure, layer upon layer, to give the leather a shaded effect. The colour is dark along the edges and lighter on the interior. The varying degree of darkness and lightness gives the leather <strong>beautiful tones and a great depth</strong>.</p><p>It’s a <strong>highly skilled traditional Italian technique</strong> that gives the leather a special character and unique finish. We use a vegetable-tanned cowhide as a base for the Silviano Sleeve. Each and every piece of the product is <strong>hand painted separately.</strong> This natural effect gives the leather a rich and luxurious look, that looks more beautiful with age. </p><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1602865761/fixh52wo9zroyirad4lf.jpg"" src=""""/></h2><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1602605193/veas0bekufjbcf3hvfsz.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1602865963/rgs15mxjkczcygn5dpos.jpg"" src=""""/></h2><p>At Silviano, we want to make your product as special for you as possible!</p><p>With our bespoke service, you can personalize your sleeves by embossing them with your initials (up to 3 letters).

Our aim was to create a high quality and well-designed product at an affordable price.At Silviano, our entire business is completely vertically integrated. This helps us to keep our costs low and monitor the manufacturing process from end to end to ensure that we are giving you the highest quality product.We manufacture the products in our factory and sell directly to the consumers, thus eliminating the middlemen and the extra costs. We want customers to buy a luxury product without the extra markup and put the savings in their own pocket.      Our leathers are carefully sourced from tanneries based around India. All our leathers and tanneries are LWG certified. We use the highest quality of vegetable-tanned leather to make our Silviano products.Colouring is done on naturally tanned leather with dye-based colours. A layer-based technique comes with hand spray applied on each panel of the product. After colouring it goes through a burnished wax process and finally a heat plate touch on the panels.It is a process used to shade leather in gradations, producing a highly organic look that gives character and soul to leather goods.Leather is a natural product - it becomes more beautiful as it ages. The items change color as you use them over time and develops a beautiful patina, which begins to tell your story.Since vegetable tanning is a more natural process, it is much more eco-friendly as compared to the full chrome leather which produces toxins in its tanning process.Vegetable tanning is the most traditional form of tanning leather that dates back to 6000 BC. It uses organic materials such as tannins from tree bark, roots of plants, and flowers to tan leather. Less than 10% of leather in the world is made using this natural process. It requires time, skill, and highly experienced craftsmen to make this type of leather.We believe that leather is a fabric of nature, and we use it with great respect for the earth and its natural eco-system. We work with leathers that are a by-product of the food industry rather than bred for stock leather. We also ensure that all industrial waste generated from the production of such leather is recycled and repurposed.Over the years leather absorbs the traces of its surroundings and the things it comes in contact with - the natural oils of your body, sunlight, water, dirt, dust, heat. Over time, it develops a natural patina. A naturally developed patina is the soft sheen that develops on the surface of the leather, imparting a character to the product. A patina on the leather is like the hallmark of a high-quality leather good. The Tamponata effect is like the natural Patina, given to the leather at the start.Tamponata is a type of hand-finishing done on leather, where the color is applied with a soft pressure, layer upon layer, to give the leather a shaded effect. The colour is dark along the edges and lighter on the interior. The varying degree of darkness and lightness gives the leather beautiful tones and a great depth.It’s a highly skilled traditional Italian technique that gives the leather a special character and unique finish. We use a vegetable-tanned cowhide as a base for the Silviano Sleeve. Each and every piece of the product is hand painted separately. This natural effect gives the leather a rich and luxurious look, that looks more beautiful with age. At Silviano, we want to make your product as special for you as possible!With our bespoke service, you can personalize your sleeves by embossing them with your initials (up to 3 letters). You can add a personal touch to your own products or gift your loved one a truly unique, thoughtful, and sentimental product that will be cherished for years.Our personalisation is done using a traditional hot press and brass blocking dies to hand-emboss your Sleeve with a gold foil.*Available at check out* DON'T MISS OUT ON OUR SPECIAL PRICES VIP BUNDLETECH SLEEVE - CHARGER + TRACKER + PERSONALISATION + CREDIT CARD HOLDER + SECRET GIFTHere at Silviano, we create products of the highest quality and finish that will last you a last a lifetime.

We aligned our goals to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development of the United Nations DESIGNED FOR LIFE We believe in buying fewer, but quality. Long-lasting products designed to last for life, are truly sustainable. Unlike leathers commercially available that are loaded with chrome and harmful metals, our vegetable tanned leathers are biodegradable and tanned the way it used to be centuries ago. Several greenwashing brands claim to use ‘vegan’ materials actually made of plastic, that do not last over a couple of years and end up in the ocean as landfill. We have also tried to add-on products like the tracking device, so you never lose your Silviano products :)REUSE, REDUCE, RECYCLE We use the highest quality of sustainable and recycled materials throughout our production process, starting from our vegetable tanned leather until the recycled packaging paper.CARBON FOOTPRINT The recycled material we use minimizes our footprint and we believe to produce using 100% local and sustainable materials and have finalized talks with partners to offset our carbon footprint. We also plant one tree for each Sleeve sold.COMPANY WITH A HEART We believed our team and artisans are part of our family and our number asset. We continue to create opportunities and give back to all of our touch points – our artisans and their families, our suppliers, management, and our community.  STRETCH GOAL - $50,000When we reach $50,000 in funding we will release the Blue colour of our Sleeve  THE STORY BEHIND OUR TEAMEstablished in 1949 and headquartered in London, Silviano Group is a family-owned company with over 70 years of experience in leather. We manufacture luxury leather goods/accessories and unique corporate gifting for exclusive luxury brands globally. The Group's reputation has been founded on the design and development of high-quality leather products for clients who require exclusivity and innovation. Our team is a seamless blend between traditional and modern. We are proud to have onboard the most skilled artisans, which our team has trained over decades.Silviano is a dreamchild of the family-run business created by brother-sister duo Nakul & Sonal Malhotra. Nakul and Sonal are both siblings in the 3rd generation family business. Founders - Brother & sister duo - Nakul & Sonal MalhotraNakul comes from a background in Finance and Sonal has a background in International Fashion, Luxury brand management, and Textile Science. They both have been fortunate to be a part of the leather goods manufacturing industry from a very young age and also throughout their working careers. They realized that there were no high-quality leather products available at an affordable price. Hence, they embarked on their journey to create the best laptop sleeve ever. They decided to combine the knowledge of skilled craftsmanship and quality passed down by their forefathers, along with their own knowledge of functionality, sustainability, modern design & technology. They spent nearly 3 years creating hundreds of prototypes to create a beautiful functional product that was of the highest quality, affordable in price, adaptable to the modern-day tech market, and most importantly, unique. And thus, Silviano Sleeve was born as the perfect amalgamation of new and old.At Silviano we used the highest quality of raw materials and created a product that has all the features of a luxury product, yet the price makes it attainable. Since we manufacture the products in our factory and sell directly to the consumers, thus eliminating all middlemen and the extra costs. We want customers to buy a luxury product without the extra mark-ups, and put the savings in their own pockets.   TIMELINE",63.0,0,"1 Campaign

It's ultra lightweight, can store up to 2TB of data, and has high read and write speeds of 500MB/s. It fits right on your key-chain for everyday carry, so you can use it whenever wherever. Accessing all your important files offline has never been more convenient. The biggest limitation of traditional external storage drives is that they are designed to be used with computers. Until now, they are also either too big to carry around or too small to have enough data storage and transfer speed. Now, with the Bullet Solid-state Drive, you can have all the benefits of a professional high speed high capacity SSD and the convenience of a thumb flash drive in one. The Bullet SSD is so convenient and powerful, you'll be able to use it for everything you do.  Size does matter. That's especially true for an everyday carry (EDC) item. The Bullet SSD is designed to be ultra lightweight and have the smallest footprint possible. Weighing just 18g and measuring only 51mm x 16mm x 8mm, it's the world's smallest high speed SSD. Just snap it onto your key-chain and you can have all your important files with you anywhere you go.     
 Unlike flash drives that have a similar size, the Bullet SSD is a full fledged solid-state drive that’s powered by TLC NAND, reaching consistent maximum transfer speeds of 500 MB/s. Transferring HD movies will only take 16 seconds and 4K movies in about 3 minutes. Due to its high read and write speeds, you can edit all your creative files directly from the Bullet SSD. Testing Rig: AMD Ryzen 2400G, B450 I AORUS PRO WIFI, 16GB x2 DDR4 3200Mhz, WD BLACK SN750 NVMe SSDThe Bullet SSD may be small in physical size, but it's got just as much storage capacity as any HDD or SSD. Choose from 1TB or 2TB; it's enough for all your precious data.  
  We understand that all data is precious, many of them are images or videos that captured the most memorable moments in your life, or they are important files that are essential for your job or school work. That's why Bullet SSD is made from a single piece of aerospace aluminum, which increases its durability. It's also IP67 certified so you won't have to worry about your data getting waterlogged.  The Bullet SSD is designed to meet your data storage needs in every aspect of your life. You can use it with desktop computers, laptops, cameras, smartphones, tablets, and even your gaming consoles.   

 


 The idea for the Bullet SSD was almost scrapped due to overheating issues. The problem with such a small external SSD is that it was too powerful for its size. The heat that was generated couldn't be dispersed fast enough and lowered performance. To solve this problem we upgraded the flash controller to a low heat generating and energy efficient model. We also employed graphene passive cooling technology by developing our own Graphene Heat Shield, which helps to quickly and evenly conduct thermal energy away from the hot spots to maintain a low operating temperature for optimal performance. Prototype Demonstration Production Prototype TestingLoading and editing the campaign video from the the production prototype with DaVinci Resolve.  Full test of the production prototype with CrystalDiskMark7, with maximum sequential read and write speeds of above 500MB/s. The internal temperature of the drive also doesn't rise above 53°C.

 
This program tests the drive by producing a 32GB test file and reads and writes on the drive. For every result, the test is done 3 times and the average value is shown. Rows 1 and 2 show the sequential read and write speeds. Rows 3 and 4 show the random read and write speeds. Here are the test results of a Samsung T5 for comparison. We are a new Startup trying to disrupt the digital storage industry by making external solid-state drives as small as possible, but not sacrifice any of its true speed potential.

Therefore, there is no need for ""bake blind"" and ""oil preparation"" (call seasoning process) as there is no rust-proof coating like ""clear coating"".

Well, leave the domestic dangers of virtual reality behind with the latest, greatest must-have gaming footwear Cybershoes!"" SYFY WIRE 
In 2018 we conducted a successful Indiegogo and Kickstarter campaign, raising more than 350k Euros from more than 1500 backers. Since then we've shipped more than 3,000 Cybershoes for wired headsets on SteamVR.We're now excited to introduce a new wireless version of Cybershoes for Oculus Quest and make VR more immersive than ever. You can help us, not only as contribution to the product's production and distribution but also fuel the number of games that natively integrate Cybershoes and general awareness to drive adoption.Your room is small but the world of VR is endless and you want to enjoy and explore it. With the success of Oculus Quest and Quest 2, players can experience true VR without a PC or bulky wires. But players are still limited by the size of their play space.

Cybershoes for Quest let players walk around in virtual worlds, no matter what their physical space looks like.


Cybershoes gives you the chance to play real multiplayer with your friends without the fear of bumping into each other. For the first time, you can sit next to your friend in the real world, and run side by side in epic adventures while staying deeply immersed in the action.


Cybershoes for Quest works for all PC VR headsets as well when used with a PC. To show continued support for our community, the new module is compatible with all Cybershoes so if you already own the system you can simply upgrade for the Quest platform. 
They are compatible with Quest/Quest2 standalone, plus Quest/Quest2+SteamVR with gaming PC, and SteamVR with any PC VR headset (see: game table).





As legs move, the chair is forgotten in no time. What counts is that you’re active and this - sort of - tricks the brain. With Cybershoes you extend the borders of your living room.  
 

1. Connect the receiver to your Oculus Quest or Quest 2Wireless Cybershoes connects to a Quest headset via Bluetooth and features an inside-out tracking system. The beauty is that the Cybershoes are seen as a Bluetooth gamepad by the Quest headset, making it very easy for game developers to integrate this awesome locomotion method in their games.  2. Strap on your Cybershoes / one size fits allWhile seated, the user straps on the Cybershoes® over his or her shoes. One size fits all.The calibration and linking to your VR rig is incredibly simple and getting ready to play is as easy as sitting in your favorite swivel bar stool and strapping on the Cybershoes to your feet 3. Let's move As legs move, the chair is forgotten in no time. What counts is that you’re active and this - sort of - tricks the brain. With Cybershoes you extend the borders of your living room.  Cybershoes are lightweight and can travel easily with you so you can stay immersed in your virtual world whenever and wherever you want.
 The key functionality of Cybershoes is that the shoes are keeping their orientation. You can walk in one direction and look in the other. By placing an additional IMU (gyroscope) inside the receiver, the raw shoe data can be processed in order to yield X and Y motion to the gamepad. The slider functions as an input multiplicator that lets you adjust the ratio of real-life speed to game speed.

<p><b><u>MISSION</u></b></p>
<p>This video sums it up nicely:</p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""435"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FL00GWqZmf6o%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DL00GWqZmf6o&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FL00GWqZmf6o%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>
<p>For the the past 15 years Gobble Gobble Give has spent every Thanksgiving feeding the homeless directly.  The charitable organizations and ‘soup kitchens’ nationwide are doing phenomenal work.  Gobble Gobble Give has a different approach.  We’re a little rough-and-tumble, a little rock-and-roll. </p>
<p>We assemble meals, clothing, and care kits for the homeless and our volunteers take these packages <i><u>directly</u></i> to the homeless and in-need. We’re a big potluck party, and if you’re reading this you’re invited! </p>
<p><b><u>WE NEED YOUR HELP</u></b></p>
<p>We’re using IndieGoGo to raise money for our annual multi-city potluck.  Gobble Gobble Give is a 501c3 non-profit and all funds go towards providing food, supplies, and any relevant facility costs to those that host our event.  Anything left over just rolls into the next year.</p>
<p>Every Thanksgiving we try to expand our ability to help feed the homeless, and every Thanksgiving we’re floored by the outreach of support (from our on-the-day volunteers to the companies that donate their goods to clothe the homeless). </p>
<p><b><u>THE NUTS &amp; BOLTS</u></b></p>
<p>We’re asking for $15,000 from the community.</p>
<p>Last year we were inspired and grateful for a successful $10k campaign on IndieGoGo. People want to help!  And we want to keep that magic growing and expanding.  </p>
<p>Funds that we raise go into a GGG general fund that we use to buy supplies and food for each location hosting a potluck event on Thanksgiving.  No more, no less.</p>
<p>We're also very excited to announce the inclusion of Nashville and Santa Ana, with more cities possibly joining as we get nearer to T-Day!!</p>
<p><b><u>THE ‘NOT SO SECRET’ SECRET</u></b></p>
<p>Helping to feed and clothe someone over the holidays is an amazing experience.  The person in need receives some love and support, yes, but the real transformative experience comes from the volunteers that give their time and energy to step away from their holiday obligations to help others. <u>We’ve seen friendships form and lives change with one service.</u></p>
<p>Thanksgiving isn’t the only opportunity for this outreach and connectivity, though.  If and when Gobble Gobble Give can keep those charitable wheels turning and growing we can start to think about year-round opportunities for giving!</p>
<p><b><u>QUID PRO QUO</u></b></p>
<p>The Raven Spa was a huge supporter for GGG last year, offering soothing and invigorating treatments and packages for generous backers. This year they’re at it again!  . And check out these shirts!! <br/></p>

<br/><p>If you really want to be a rockstar (or at least prepare meals next to one), come join in on the fun for a couple of hours on Thanksgiving morning!</p>
<p><b><u>GIVE ON, PARTY ON</u></b></p>
<p>Gobble Gobble Give offers this potluck event for volunteers every year.  If you can’t donate, spread the word and better yet come help out!</p>
<p>This year we plan to host potluck events in the following cities on Thanksgiving:</p>
<ul>
<li>Los Angeles, CA - Echo Park</li>

</div></div>","A SKID ROW CHRISTMASTHANKSGIVING WAS A HUGE SUCCESS!!  We were able to offer more than 14,000 meals, nationwide, to those in need this holiday! Records were broken and we just keep growing.But this party, well it just don't stop.  We have a few days left to contribute to the community and we're doing so by continuing the giving spirit.  This month we'll be giving toys and/or clothes to those in need!  And we'll be doing it from this sweet ride:Beginning today, #GivingTuesday, our every thought is bent towards getting toys to kids in need.   Please help us spread the word and know that all of the funds generated for this and our Thanksgiving event go directly to those in need.


MISSION
This video sums it up nicely:

For the the past 15 years Gobble Gobble Give has spent every Thanksgiving feeding the homeless directly.  The charitable organizations and ‘soup kitchens’ nationwide are doing phenomenal work.  Gobble Gobble Give has a different approach.  We’re a little rough-and-tumble, a little rock-and-roll. 
We assemble meals, clothing, and care kits for the homeless and our volunteers take these packages directly to the homeless and in-need. We’re a big potluck party, and if you’re reading this you’re invited! 
WE NEED YOUR HELP
We’re using IndieGoGo to raise money for our annual multi-city potluck.  Gobble Gobble Give is a 501c3 non-profit and all funds go towards providing food, supplies, and any relevant facility costs to those that host our event.  Anything left over just rolls into the next year.
Every Thanksgiving we try to expand our ability to help feed the homeless, and every Thanksgiving we’re floored by the outreach of support (from our on-the-day volunteers to the companies that donate their goods to clothe the homeless). 
THE NUTS & BOLTS
We’re asking for $15,000 from the community.
Last year we were inspired and grateful for a successful $10k campaign on IndieGoGo. People want to help!  And we want to keep that magic growing and expanding.  
Funds that we raise go into a GGG general fund that we use to buy supplies and food for each location hosting a potluck event on Thanksgiving.  No more, no less.
We're also very excited to announce the inclusion of Nashville and Santa Ana, with more cities possibly joining as we get nearer to T-Day!!
THE ‘NOT SO SECRET’ SECRET
Helping to feed and clothe someone over the holidays is an amazing experience.  The person in need receives some love and support, yes, but the real transformative experience comes from the volunteers that give their time and energy to step away from their holiday obligations to help others. We’ve seen friendships form and lives change with one service.
Thanksgiving isn’t the only opportunity for this outreach and connectivity, though.  If and when Gobble Gobble Give can keep those charitable wheels turning and growing we can start to think about year-round opportunities for giving!
QUID PRO QUO
The Raven Spa was a huge supporter for GGG last year, offering soothing and invigorating treatments and packages for generous backers. This year they’re at it again!  . And check out these shirts!! 



If you really want to be a rockstar (or at least prepare meals next to one), come join in on the fun for a couple of hours on Thanksgiving morning!
GIVE ON, PARTY ON
Gobble Gobble Give offers this potluck event for volunteers every year.  If you can’t donate, spread the word and better yet come help out!
This year we plan to host potluck events in the following cities on Thanksgiving:

Los Angeles, CA - Echo Park
Los Angeles, CA - Santa Monica
Harlem, NY
Austin, TX
Las Vegas, NV
Santa Ana, CA
Nashville, TN

<p>Twist Tickets is an
online e-ticketing platform that will allow you to search, share, and purchase
tickets to your favorite events. </p>
<p>My name is Roy Hinson
III. I am a young financial professional who, like a lot of you, has watched
innovation over the last 5 to 10 years and found a glaring absence in the world
of events and ticketing. The only advancement comes in higher prices and added
hassle for the events we want to enjoy. After doing some research you find
there is really only one company monopolizing the industry and controlling the
secondary market in which its products are sold. Without outwardly saying the
name, this company’s initials are TM. TM has been around for a very long time
with little innovation favoring the customer or the customer experience. </p>
<p>I am going to build an
online e-ticketing platform that puts the customer first. It will be more difficult
for bots to be used and easier to see events and concerts without excessive
fees and ultra-excessive repurchase prices. This is not only a crowdfund for a
project but an opportunity to make your voice heard by taking a stand against
TM and letting them know it’s time for a change. <a rel=""noopener nofollow"">[KM1]</a> </p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>The reason for running
this campaign is because development takes a team and that team costs money.
What we are hoping is to reach our goal to help put that team together and pay
our developer so we can create the first generation apps, on both IOS and Android, for our
platform. </p>
<p>To you we are offering
a dedicated ticketing platform with a commitment to innovation and to doing the
right thing when it comes to our business practices. Fees are a given these
days but when that fee becomes almost as much as the ticket itself, there is a
problem. We promise to bring a platform with a sensible approach. </p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>Your contribution will
go toward paying our developers. Any monies over and above our goal will go toward
expanding our team by hiring the marketing team and other essential personnel needed
to make this project a success. </p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>Our main challenge is
being the underdog. We don't have the size or monetary funds to take on a
company like TM but we are hoping for a shot. I think that's something we here
at Twist are great at taking advantage of, the opportunity to show what a small
group of hungry individuals can accomplish. We have persevered through “no's”
and failures at business competitions, improving every day. We are ready to
take the leap of faith and build this company. Join the journey with us. </p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>We understand that not
everyone can make a monetary contribution, but if you like the idea and think
it should be developed please share with friends and family. We appreciate the
help that getting as many eyes on this as possible can bring. </p>

Attach the DUEX Pro monitor to the back of any laptop, and you’re ready to work wherever you are! 
 

 
 
  
 
  DUEX Pro is plug and display. Simply plug DUEX into your laptop, and you’re ready to boost your productivity by up to 50%!  DUEX Pro provides a full 270° rotation, with the option for a 180° presentation mode, so you can choose your optimum viewing angle for any situation. You can also slide DUEX to either side of your laptop screen.  DUEX Pro was created with high-quality industry materials and can withstand the wear and tear that comes with transporting your laptop around.  At 1.7 pounds, DUEX Pro gives you the true mobility you need to move from workspace to workspace.  The DUEX Pro video driver has an energy-star rating to reduce battery drain from your laptop.  DUEX Pro is compatible with any laptop via simple USB connection and available in a 12.5-inch size to best fit your laptop.  DUEX Pro has a 1080p high-resolution display, so everything you see is crisp and clear.   Toggling between tabs, windows, and applications can make us lose, on average, about 10 seconds every five minutes. That adds up to be a huge loss in productivity on an average workday.
  Unfortunately, a second desktop monitor doesn’t help employees when they work from home or travel. DUEX Pro is a convenient, yet affordable, on-the-go dual screen option, so the large fraction of the computer-using population isn’t forced to lose out on the proven benefits and productivity that come with using multiple screens.                    

 Every product stems from the invention of necessity, and DUEX is no different. Here’s our story about how we came up with our innovative dual-screen laptop accessory.While working at Amazon, DUEX’s creator, Jack, was constantly frustrated by the lack of a secondary monitor that could help him work more efficiently. Feeling strangely nostalgic about the work monitor he used at his previous job, he decided to build a laptop monitor from a broken laptop. During the process, he realized that most of the secondary monitors available were stationary, and he couldn’t move around with them. So, he built a prototype of a light and portable monitor that he could carry anywhere with him.  Soon, everyone in the office wanted one, and our product, DUEX, was born!  Yao and Banda are from the MIT school of engineering and the MIT Sloan School of Management where they gained funding from MIT Sandbox, which promotes student entrepreneurship. The team is also funded by IDEA Northeastern, which is a venture accelerator, as Ng attends Northeastern University.     We can’t thank you enough for checking out our project and helping us make DUEX a reality.We know not everyone will be able to support us with a pledge, so even if you can’t give a dollar or purchase DUEX, if you’re a supporter of DUEX, you can help us spread the word on Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, Instagram and anywhere else you can think of!FAQ1.

HOW DO YOU DO IT?
Fundamentally, the core of my design process is in creating a collaborative environment between the designer and the computer.

Using custom designed software, I code a series of rules for each pattern. Every rule that I add is a limitation which determines the shape, size, and style of each design. After carefully selecting the limitations, the computer generates the most logical pattern that can fit within these specifications. However, each computer generated pattern is constrained to the screen, and can only be represented two-dimensionally.

We are people who not only care about social good, but want to Do something about it.</p><ul>
<li>There are millions of people from 18-35 (and outside that age range) who do not currently give their time or money to charity - what if we could entice them with the ease and simplicity of doing so right from their phones? Even if each person only gave $1 or one hour, imagine the massive impact on the causes that matter most.</li>
<li>Founded in November 2013, The DoNation quickly developed a website connecting donors to 1 or 100 charities, at any dollar amount, within seconds. </li>
<li>Now we want to expand this capability to every web and mobile device - in the form of an app. We also want to enhance the community, social sharing, and volunteering capabilities of our website so we can come closer to fulfilling our mission. </li>
<li>Imagine giving to any non-profit in the world instantly from your phone, especially in times of emergency or special need. Imagine coordinating volunteer events and actions from your phone - even competing with your friends to attain higher levels of Do - imagine a global community of givers, one that didn't exist before. </li>
</ul><p>Let's build an app that will change the world, together. Let's revolutionize not only the way people give, but the way they Do More and Do Good in their communities!</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/363435/files/20140211102745-donationapp.jpg?1392143265"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3>Paul Gubbay, VP, Design and Web, Adobe Systems is pumped about DoNation!</h3><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FTlu1hPSeq24%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DTlu1hPSeq24&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FTlu1hPSeq24%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Our Mission and Vision</h3><ul>
<li><p>Mission: DoNation is 
dedicated to increasing global contributions and raising awareness of 
charitable causes through the growing community of social media.</p></li>
<li><p>Vision: A
 global population of givers who are empowered and more active in their 
communities because of their social connections through DoNation to 
charities/volunteering/activism opportunities in their communities. 
Millions of people coordinating volunteer events and opportunities, 
donating to emergencies and worthy causes instantly, and investing their
 time in the causes they believe in - all in one place. </p></li>
<li><p>Goals:
 To make social good, donating, and volunteering more mainstream, easy 
to access, and popular via a ready-to-use, easily navigable interface 
and infrastructure that caters to people of all backgrounds, histories, 
and social situations.</p></li>
</ul><p></p><h3>The App, Website, and What You Get<br/>
</h3><p>Here's the skinny:</p><ul>
<li>Each app platform (that's iOS and Android) will cost about $15,000. We will use the rest of the money to make our website more social, communal, and national.</li>
<li>The app will be a simple, user-friendly interface that will allow Facebook and Twitter integration along with the ability to arrange one time or recurring donations within seconds.<br/>
</li>
<li>Show the world that you Do! $5 gets you some sweet stickers. $15 gets you an ""I Do. Do You?"" t-shirt! $25 gets you access to the beta version of the app on your platform. $250 gets you a Super Do-Per Cape from Amazing Capes (another successfully crowdfunded company) and a Skype Date with the Founder.<br/>
</li>
<li>If we don't reach our entire goal, we will use what we get to nationalize the website, add a huge amount of social integration, and make the first DoNation Stations. </li>

<li>How many people do you know that currently give to charitable causes or non-profits? How many of your friends would be <i>much more likely</i> to give if it was THIS easy?!<br/>
</li>
<li>According to BlackBaud, a popular fundraising company, <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/blackbaud/the-next-generation-of-american-giving-by-blackbaud-25222304"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">62% of Generation X </a>would be willing to give to charity through their phones. Why don't we make this happen, together?<br/>

<li>DoNation Stations will eliminate the need for checks, cash, and 
forms - all in the lobby of your favorite non-profit, instantly. Imagine
 how many more people would be willing to give a few dollars here and 
there with a swipe of their credit card or by simply clicking ""Yes"" to 
use their preexisting DoNation account. </li>
<li>With a 
ready-to-use infrastructure built specifically for each non-profit, 
every organization will have a customized DoNation Station look and 
feel. When placed in an independent organization, donating to multiple 
non-profits will be disabled so as to maximize the contribution to that 
non-profit. The user will still be able to share their volunteer commitment or monetary gift through the station. </li>
</ul><p></p><h2>FAQ</h2><p><b>Is DoNation a non-profit? </b>Yes. We are currently registered with the State of North Carolina a public benefit non-profit corporation. We sent the IRS our 501(c)(3) application in December, so we're just waiting on them to tell us they love us.</p><p><b>Do you take a cut? </b>Yes. 1.1% of each transaction. Which is very, very low (especially compared to other ""charity"" sites who are taking between 4-7% of each transaction for themselves). If you do the math, we'd have to have over $2,000,000 in transactions to provide ourselves with an average teacher's salary. So, yeah, we're not in it for the money. <br/></p><p><b>Then why? </b>Because the non-profit world needs this tool - if you know anything about non-profits they are often lacking in technological efficiency, modernization, and their websites look like they're from 1999. We're here to change that. <br/></p><p><b>What's your end-goal? </b>A worldwide community of givers, Doers, and people who are totes in to changing the world. A bunch of people who were never really aware of the world of non-profits or social good donating between $1 and $5 monthly to charities (see: millions into the non-profit world that weren't there before). Dare we say.. the ""Facebook"" of #socialgood. <br/></p><p><b>Any other preguntas?</b> That's Spanish for questions. See, you learned something today!

We are people who not only care about social good, but want to Do something about it.
There are millions of people from 18-35 (and outside that age range) who do not currently give their time or money to charity - what if we could entice them with the ease and simplicity of doing so right from their phones? Even if each person only gave $1 or one hour, imagine the massive impact on the causes that matter most.
Founded in November 2013, The DoNation quickly developed a website connecting donors to 1 or 100 charities, at any dollar amount, within seconds. 
Now we want to expand this capability to every web and mobile device - in the form of an app. We also want to enhance the community, social sharing, and volunteering capabilities of our website so we can come closer to fulfilling our mission. 
Imagine giving to any non-profit in the world instantly from your phone, especially in times of emergency or special need. Imagine coordinating volunteer events and actions from your phone - even competing with your friends to attain higher levels of Do - imagine a global community of givers, one that didn't exist before. 
Let's build an app that will change the world, together. Let's revolutionize not only the way people give, but the way they Do More and Do Good in their communities!Paul Gubbay, VP, Design and Web, Adobe Systems is pumped about DoNation!Our Mission and Vision
Mission: DoNation is 
dedicated to increasing global contributions and raising awareness of 
charitable causes through the growing community of social media.
Vision: A
 global population of givers who are empowered and more active in their 
communities because of their social connections through DoNation to 
charities/volunteering/activism opportunities in their communities. 
Millions of people coordinating volunteer events and opportunities, 
donating to emergencies and worthy causes instantly, and investing their
 time in the causes they believe in - all in one place. 
Goals:
 To make social good, donating, and volunteering more mainstream, easy 
to access, and popular via a ready-to-use, easily navigable interface 
and infrastructure that caters to people of all backgrounds, histories, 
and social situations.
The App, Website, and What You Get
Here's the skinny:
Each app platform (that's iOS and Android) will cost about $15,000. We will use the rest of the money to make our website more social, communal, and national.
The app will be a simple, user-friendly interface that will allow Facebook and Twitter integration along with the ability to arrange one time or recurring donations within seconds.

Show the world that you Do! $5 gets you some sweet stickers. $15 gets you an ""I Do. Do You?"" t-shirt! $25 gets you access to the beta version of the app on your platform. $250 gets you a Super Do-Per Cape from Amazing Capes (another successfully crowdfunded company) and a Skype Date with the Founder.

If we don't reach our entire goal, we will use what we get to nationalize the website, add a huge amount of social integration, and make the first DoNation Stations. 
The ImpactMillions of people who have never given before contributing to the causes that matter most.
How many people do you know that currently give to charitable causes or non-profits? How many of your friends would be much more likely to give if it was THIS easy?!

According to BlackBaud, a popular fundraising company, 62% of Generation X would be willing to give to charity through their phones. Why don't we make this happen, together?

Everyone wants to Do More Good in the world - now we can, right from our phones and other mobile devices.

DoNation Stations
DoNation Stations will eliminate the need for checks, cash, and 
forms - all in the lobby of your favorite non-profit, instantly. Imagine
 how many more people would be willing to give a few dollars here and 
there with a swipe of their credit card or by simply clicking ""Yes"" to 
use their preexisting DoNation account. 
With a 
ready-to-use infrastructure built specifically for each non-profit, 
every organization will have a customized DoNation Station look and 
feel. When placed in an independent organization, donating to multiple 
non-profits will be disabled so as to maximize the contribution to that 
non-profit. The user will still be able to share their volunteer commitment or monetary gift through the station. 
FAQIs DoNation a non-profit? Yes. We are currently registered with the State of North Carolina a public benefit non-profit corporation. We sent the IRS our 501(c)(3) application in December, so we're just waiting on them to tell us they love us.Do you take a cut? Yes. 1.1% of each transaction. Which is very, very low (especially compared to other ""charity"" sites who are taking between 4-7% of each transaction for themselves). If you do the math, we'd have to have over $2,000,000 in transactions to provide ourselves with an average teacher's salary. So, yeah, we're not in it for the money. Then why? Because the non-profit world needs this tool - if you know anything about non-profits they are often lacking in technological efficiency, modernization, and their websites look like they're from 1999. We're here to change that. What's your end-goal? A worldwide community of givers, Doers, and people who are totes in to changing the world. A bunch of people who were never really aware of the world of non-profits or social good donating between $1 and $5 monthly to charities (see: millions into the non-profit world that weren't there before). Dare we say.. the ""Facebook"" of #socialgood. Any other preguntas? That's Spanish for questions. See, you learned something today! But seriously, if you have any other questions, concerns, ruminations, musings, commiserations, or just want to scream at the top of your lungs, feel free to drop us a line. We pledge 100% transparency in everything we do, no if's, and's, but's, or butt's about it.The CEO of TopFloor Studio Web Design Firm is excited about DoNation!
