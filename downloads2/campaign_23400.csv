<h3>VAST by Amber Funk Barton</h3>
<p>Hello Everyone!</p>
<p>I have been making dances for as long as I can remember.  As an only child, I happily entertained myself for hours this way.  I would make up stories, write them down and then dance them out.  I would put on records and perform for invisible audiences.  The comfort I found in being alone has shaped my practice as a dance artist.</p>
<p>I named my company <a href=""http://www.responsedance.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">'the response.</a>' as a way to evoke how I make dance.  I respond to music I hear and the emotions I feel.  After years of creating everything from group dances to full length productions, I decided to return to how I began my career: alone and making dances for myself.</p>
<p>In 2015, I approached some of my most beloved collaborators with an idea: I wanted to make a work inspired by universal space.  As we began to research ideas, I realized that the work was a solo and that I should be performing it.  The ideas and imagery that we discovered were too personal and vulnerable for me to hand off to someone else to perform. </p>
<p>This has led to more research and discovery than I have ever experienced as a choreographer.  </p>

<p><strong>More about VAST:</strong></p>
<p><i>""We are a way for the universe to know itself. Some part of our being knows this is where we came from. We long to return. And we can, because the cosmos is also within us. We're made of star stuff.""</i> -Carl Sagan</p>
<p>VAST is about a body in space.  Quotes from the scientist Carl Sagan inspired me to create a solo that evokes an otherworldly journey that is both physical and spiritual.  The idea that chemical elements found in stars are also present in the human body is not only poetic but deeply moves me.  I love the idea that there will always be elements of myself, and thus all of us that will exist forever.  I feel that this is a hopeful idea and that it is important to create a work that celebrates the duality of a human life that is both powerless and mighty. </p>
<p>When I dance VAST, it feels like I am lost in a dream that shifts without my consent, eventually forcing me to surrender to the rhythm of the universe that gives me permission to exist.</p>
<p>The creation of VAST has allowed me to accept a fundamental truth about my identity as a dance artist.  As a choreographer, my strength lies when I am the sole interpreter of my work.  I have choreographed many solos for myself in the past but VAST will be the first time I create a full length solo. It is important for me that VAST is produced by the response. because I founded my company in order to always have a home for my creative works, whatever the form.  </p>
<p>VAST brings together artistry of <a href=""http://www.andreaskahre.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Andreas Kahre </a>(set design), <a href=""http://www.mikeinwood.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Mike Inwood </a>(light design), Marc Stewart (sound design and music composition), Jean Okada (costume design), <a href=""http://www.heatherlauragray.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Heather Laura Gray</a> (dramaturge) and Lina Fitzner (rehearsal director) to create a singular performance that I desire to share with as many people as people.  </p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>materials for our set </strong>(we need to create a black frame to lay on a white dance floor for the performance space to appear in the shape of an ellipses.  We also need materials to build of an irregular ""satellite""--see photo above!-- that will hang above the dancer in the performance space)</li>

<p>After <i>so much work </i>and research with my collaborators it would be truly heartbreaking if we can't share the work with you the way we have intended.  I can guarantee you that not a penny will go to waste! </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>VAST will be a huge milestone for me as a dance artist.  I have choreographed many solos for myself in the past but VAST will be the first time I create a full length solo. </p>
<p>I have been a professional contemporary dance artist in Vancouver for 17 years and I founded <a href=""http://www.responsedance.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the response.</a> in 2008.  With the response. I have a proven track record of creating, directing and producing my own work.  I have premiered three full length works (<a href=""http://www.responsedance.com/new-page-1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">RISK</a>, <a href=""http://www.responsedance.com/portraits-and-scenes-of-female-creatures"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Portraits and Scenes of Female Creatures</a> and <a href=""http://www.responsedance.com/the-arts-of-stealing"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Art of Stealing</a>), several full length productions and multiple shorter works, had my work performed locally, provincially and nationally, run our company's <a href=""http://vimeo.com/238292253"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Apprentice Program</a><a href=""http://www.responsedance.com/apprentice-program/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> </a>and have begun an outreach program to teach dance to all dancers and dance lovers, regardless of experience called <a href=""http://www.responsedance.com/dancehappy/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">#dancehappy</a>.  </p>

<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>It has been a challenge to receive funding from organizations for VAST the typical way my company has done in the past.  This has led me to seek out alternative methods to raise money for VAST.  Although we have received much support through residencies, individual donations during our first phase of research and a small amount of project funding from the City of Vancouver and British Columbia Arts Council, it is in no way enough for us to premiere the work.  This situation has already caused me to move my premiere dates twice to accommodate another round of grant applications.</p>
</div><div>
<p>I truly love what I have created with my collaborators and I am determined to share what we have made with all of you. </p>
<p>The biggest takeaway I have realized in the making of VAST is that we are all connected.  We are all made of the same chemicals found in stars and are intrinsically linked.  All of us play a part in each others lives, great and small.  I understand this now more than ever.  And I am so grateful to have made it this far.  My hope with VAST is that through my performance I can assure people that they are not alone.  That their body is great and small, just like mine, in this universe.  That I see them.  That I appreciate their presence and know that we are all in this life together hoping, looking, asking and wondering what the answers are to all of our questions. </p>

<h3>The project . . .</h3>
<p>The Stones</p>
<p>by Kit Brookman</p>

<p>But then the stones begin to arrive...</p>
<p>The award winning Australian playwright Kit Brookman has crafted a contemporary gothic mystery in which a splintering present gives way to a murky future. Starring Jeff Burrell (Berlin Station, A Hologram for the King, Nymphomaniac) and directed by Geordie Brookman (Things I Know To Be True - State Theatre Company SA &amp; Frantic Assembly) The Stones will deliver a rare combination of creeping dread and poetry.</p>

<h3>What We Need . . .</h3>
<p>We're staging The Stones independently of any government funding because we believe that the production will connect with English speaking audiences in Berlin and go on to have a significant future life after its debut season at the ACUD Theater. But to get to opening night we have to cover the costs of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rehearsal space</li>
<li>Promotional material</li>
<li>Set and costume requirements</li>
<li>Technical costs</li>
<li>Occasionally buy Geordie and Jeff a sandwich for lunch while they are rehearsing</li>
</ul>
<p>The wonderful ACUD Theater is supporting us by providing the venue for our initial four performance run for a small share of what will be a limited box office. Any funds raised beyond the immediate hard costs of the production will go towards fees for the artists involved. Currently we are all making the piece 'for the love' of it.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact . . .</h3>
<p>The German debut of The Stones will: </p>
<ul>
<li>see the Berlin debut of writer Kit Brookman, director Geordie Brookman and composer Jason Sweeney.</li>
<li>bring a compelling piece of new Australian writing to the Berlin stage.</li>
<li>contribute to the development of an English speaking theatre audience in Berlin</li>
<li>create a springboard for the future life of a truly spine tingling piece of theatre</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>2020 was a nightmare of a year for artists everywhere. Starved of an outlet and a connection with the audience it has led to a time of introspection for many of us. The Stones represents a new stylistic step for director Geordie Brookman utilising his ideas about direct storytelling and empathetic audience connection. It's a tough environment to make work of any scale in and we face risks including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Audience limitations and consequential reduction in box office income due to COVID 19</li>
<li>Complete theatre closures requiring the development of online versions of the work.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you're not able to contribute financially you can help spread the word through your networks either to potential donors or to potential audience members. We appreciate the time and generosity that each and everyone of you bring to this proposal and we couldn't be more determined to bring this compelling piece of theatre to the stage.</p>

<h3>BROADWAY</h3>
<ul><li>I'm <strong>Stephanie Lexis</strong>: performer, writer, and founder of <strong>Broadway Body Positivity Project</strong>. I believe that musical theatre actors of <strong>ALL</strong> shapes, sizes, and abilities deserve to shine on the stage. While the industry's talent pool is more diverse and exciting than ever, casting standards are still quite antiquated: roles like romantic leads, ingenues, and princesses (aka characters who are desirable and worthy of love) are reserved for slim, statuesque women; whereas plus size women are limited to evil villains, stereotypical fat characters, and other characters with unlikeable/undesirable traits.</li></ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1570573957/pr8zbttg9psmo3fxrna3.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>These casting standards are problematic for several reasons:</p>
<p>              A. It promotes the idea that one must be slim to be considered beautiful and worthy of love</p>
<p>             B.  It insinuates that plus size actresses don't have the talents to play romantic leads,     ingenue roles, simply because they have more body fat.</p>
<p>             C.  We miss out on great storytelling when we cast roles the same way over and over again.</p>
<p><strong>So with that in mind......  </strong> </p>
<p>I am producing a <strong>nationwide photography &amp; cinematography shoot </strong>in which 7 incredibly talented plus size actresses will portray leading ladies, ingenues, and princesses from popular musicals. This shoot will showcase the talent that the theatre industry often overlooks for these roles. Upon completion of the photo and video shoot, the finished product will be presented online (<b>let's go viral!!!</b>), as well as at theatre conferences and conventions.</p>
<p>We are aiming for an online premiere in <strong>late January 2020</strong>. </p>

</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>We are determined to raise at least <strong>$16,000 USD</strong>, which will all go to good use: each model would receive <strong>$2K</strong> to cover expenses such as photography (est. $300-1k), cinematography (est. $500-1,500K), hair &amp; makeup (est. $75-250), costumes (est. $75-350), accessories (est. $15-200), recording studio time (est. $100-300). The remaining <strong>$2K </strong>would go towards advertising, licensing music, reimbursing our creative team for their tireless work.</li>
<li>But dont'cha worry, we have AWESOME perks for theatre fans: we have live and online coaching sessions for aspiring artists (1 of those contributors will have a session with a seasoned Broadway actress).</li>
<li>Our largest prize includes dinner with a <strong>Broadway actor</strong> in NYC. </li>
<li>There are also great little prizes at $10, like getting behind the scenes access; $25 for personalized poetry, etc.</li>
<li>We will deliver this project, no matter how much is raised. That being said, if too little is raised, we might have to postpone the project's debut date.</li>

              A. It promotes the idea that one must be slim to be considered beautiful and worthy of love
             B.  It insinuates that plus size actresses don't have the talents to play romantic leads,     ingenue roles, simply because they have more body fat.
             C.  We miss out on great storytelling when we cast roles the same way over and over again.
So with that in mind......   
I am producing a nationwide photography & cinematography shoot in which 7 incredibly talented plus size actresses will portray leading ladies, ingenues, and princesses from popular musicals. This shoot will showcase the talent that the theatre industry often overlooks for these roles. Upon completion of the photo and video shoot, the finished product will be presented online (let's go viral!!!), as well as at theatre conferences and conventions.
We are aiming for an online premiere in late January 2020. 
       

What We Need & What You Get
 

We are determined to raise at least $16,000 USD, which will all go to good use: each model would receive $2K to cover expenses such as photography (est. $300-1k), cinematography (est. $500-1,500K), hair & makeup (est. $75-250), costumes (est. $75-350), accessories (est. $15-200), recording studio time (est. $100-300). The remaining $2K would go towards advertising, licensing music, reimbursing our creative team for their tireless work.
But dont'cha worry, we have AWESOME perks for theatre fans: we have live and online coaching sessions for aspiring artists (1 of those contributors will have a session with a seasoned Broadway actress).
Our largest prize includes dinner with a Broadway actor in NYC. 
There are also great little prizes at $10, like getting behind the scenes access; $25 for personalized poetry, etc.
We will deliver this project, no matter how much is raised. That being said, if too little is raised, we might have to postpone the project's debut date.

<h3>The Show</h3>
<p>In it's third incarnation, Visceral Abstractions returns April 9th and 18th to the Slipper Room. </p>

<p> </p>
<h3>The Team</h3>
<p>Juanita is an aerial performer, puppet, costume, and prop designer who convinced some of her most brilliant friends to join her in creating this show and making their collective theatrical dreams come true. </p>
<p>Dana is a human of the following tendencies: feminist, scientific, designing, technological, acrobatic, performing, absurdist, practical, questionable.</p>
<p>Cheeky Lane is a performer, creator of beautiful objects, puppeteer, cat mom, stripping art school drop out. </p>
<p>Tamara flies high and dreams big. When not contemplating life in the air, she is bridging gaps as a speech-language pathologist. KEEPS IN ORDER</p>
<p>We are working together to take the show we created further. Now that we have managed to get it together and create a solid work we want to revamp and take some of the things we created to a higher level. This includes making sure that our puppets have the right mechanics, renting more rehearsal space to make sure all the details are considered in the acts, investing in materials to create new props to properly stage scenes etc.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We love working but until Visceral Abstractions becomes the next hit on Broadway we need a bit of support funding the following,</p>
<ul>
<li>Rehearsal space. We use a combination of dance studios which cost between $10/$15 per hour and aerial studios where its about $26 per rehearsal. </li>
<li>Materials. Fabric/ foam/ wire/ etc adds up! The less we have to panic about how much we spend on them the freer we will be to make objects to blow your mind! </li>
<li>Tech crew. We need to hire a stage hand and a stage manager. If you saw the first version of the show you know why! It was madness!</li>
<li>Rigging! We have to rig multiple aerial apparatuses, puppets, a giant shark, etc. we could maybe even hire a rigger... that would be the dream. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What do you get out of it?</h3>
<p>We do not in any way feel entitled to your money but we do hope that we can appeal to your generosity with one of our many perks. Have you ever wanted to learn aerial? We will give you a private lesson! Do you want to learn how to sew? Ill teach you! Do you need a sexy hand made leather fanny pack? I can make you one! Are you a trapeze artist tired of burning your feet? Guess where you can get some fancy hand made chevaliers;)? Are you traveling to Burning Man and need an sequin outfit that can be seen from outer space? I got you. Do you just want to reserve a seat for the show? You can do it here!</p>
<p>We just want to make a bit of magic. Sometimes what's needed is a bit of time to imagine a different world, to enter a space where the mind is momentarily liberated to allow us to keep moving forward. The last two versions of this show created a connection with the audience that reinvigorated our spirits and with your help we will keep pushing that momentum forward.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Old bones ache before a storm. Within an hour trowel had hit bone, and the moment it did, the thunder rolled in. The archaeologists disturbed something that, frankly, should not have been disturbed.<br/><br/>Poor, poor Richard. Awoken, removed from his resting place, comfortably under concrete, under a council car park. <br/><br/>Knights, halberds, succession, and horrendous violence. A carpark, yellow hard hats, high vis jackets and archaeologists. <br/><br/>Dive thoughts, down to my soul… Join us for a fusion of modern and 15th-century slander!</p>
</div><div>
<h2>We Need Your Help</h2>
<p>Unfortunately putting on a play ain't free, and this is where we need your help. Let me try and explain where all this money will be going! First off I like to say that this budget is just the upfront cost of actually getting the play made.</p>
<p> </p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1527419105/gcr8ljz10joyqkpdqu1b.png"" src=""""/><p> </p>
</div><div>
<p>As you can see from our lovely pie chart the construction of sets is our biggest expense. Creating a mixture of 15th-century grandeur and a dingy carpark in Leicester is no mean feat. The £700 would mostly be to cover material costs, labour and transporting the sets to the venue. Here are some of our early mockups of the set, just for you.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1527431121/gpjpbewmhhggh1uapvbi.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Costumes is another big hitter! Richard III has a whole bunch of characters in it and they all need clothes. Have you ever wanted to see the Duchess of York in a high-vis jacket or King Edward with a hard hat crown? no? Well, you might just be about to.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1527431432/ifob5tfbywjnunvn3q3b.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>As for props; we need swords,<strong> lots of swords.</strong></p>
<p>Lastly is the venue hire. Upstairs at The Gatehouse have kindly agreed to host us, but they want cash! (reasonable) </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Who Are We?</h2>
<p>You might be asking, ""who are you?"". Let me explain.</p>
<h3>Director</h3>
<p>Lata Nobes is  British Indian theatre director from South London. Her work includes Not About Heroes, (Lion and Unicorn, Camden Fringe, 2016) and Amadeus (Oxford Playhouse Burton-Taylor Studio, 2016) and Bed of Roses (Cuckoo-bang, Bits 2017). She was also co-director for Cry-Blueberry, (The Cockpit, 2018) and Assistant Director for Glockenspiel (Tristan-Bates Theatre, 2017). Last year, Lata was chosen as a young emerging director to receive mentoring at the Young Vic as part of their Introduction to Directing course. She is also a drama facilitator, musician, and poet.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Producer </h3>
<p>Brad Johnson recently graduated with first-class honours in Digital Film and Video from London South Bank University. Spending 3 years writing, directing, producing and editing a variety of different projects. His film “Chess Club” was chosen as the film of the year by the faculty and nominated for Best Comedy Short at Screentest film festival.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Production Designer</h3>
<p>George Chaffey is about to graduate from BA Textile Design at the world-renowned Central Saint Martins. In 2014 George was named as Young Fashion Designer of the Year; UK South. His work often revolves around ideas of light, colour, structure and how these elements can work within a space. Having worked on large-scale immersive installations and sets, George has found that his textile work has given him an additional view of how many different elements, materials and techniques can combine to create visual impact. In addition to his 3D work, George has continued his woven textile designs, investigating how these traditional approaches can be integrated with technologies and new materials.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Costume Designer </h3>
<p>Hannah Snaith has just finished her second year in the BA Painting course at UAL Camberwell and is taking a year out before she finishes her degree. She has worked as a poster artist on the director Lata's previous plays, and as a costume and prop supervisor for 'Not About Heroes'. Her love of shopping will be very useful in creating the costumes for this play, as they will be sourced from vintage pound sales, charity shops, the high street, actor's wardrobes, and anywhere else she can get her hands on clothing to create the medieval-esque outfits for this Richard III/modern day crossover rendition of Shakespeare's play.</p>

<h2>Thank you!</h2>

Old bones ache before a storm. Within an hour trowel had hit bone, and the moment it did, the thunder rolled in. The archaeologists disturbed something that, frankly, should not have been disturbed.Poor, poor Richard. Awoken, removed from his resting place, comfortably under concrete, under a council car park. Knights, halberds, succession, and horrendous violence. A carpark, yellow hard hats, high vis jackets and archaeologists. Dive thoughts, down to my soul… Join us for a fusion of modern and 15th-century slander!

We Need Your Help
Unfortunately putting on a play ain't free, and this is where we need your help. Let me try and explain where all this money will be going! First off I like to say that this budget is just the upfront cost of actually getting the play made.
 
 

As you can see from our lovely pie chart the construction of sets is our biggest expense. Creating a mixture of 15th-century grandeur and a dingy carpark in Leicester is no mean feat. The £700 would mostly be to cover material costs, labour and transporting the sets to the venue. Here are some of our early mockups of the set, just for you.  

Costumes is another big hitter! Richard III has a whole bunch of characters in it and they all need clothes. Have you ever wanted to see the Duchess of York in a high-vis jacket or King Edward with a hard hat crown? no? Well, you might just be about to.

As for props; we need swords, lots of swords.
Lastly is the venue hire. Upstairs at The Gatehouse have kindly agreed to host us, but they want cash! (reasonable) 
 
Who Are We?
You might be asking, ""who are you?"". Let me explain.
Director
Lata Nobes is  British Indian theatre director from South London. Her work includes Not About Heroes, (Lion and Unicorn, Camden Fringe, 2016) and Amadeus (Oxford Playhouse Burton-Taylor Studio, 2016) and Bed of Roses (Cuckoo-bang, Bits 2017). She was also co-director for Cry-Blueberry, (The Cockpit, 2018) and Assistant Director for Glockenspiel (Tristan-Bates Theatre, 2017). Last year, Lata was chosen as a young emerging director to receive mentoring at the Young Vic as part of their Introduction to Directing course. She is also a drama facilitator, musician, and poet.
 
Producer 
Brad Johnson recently graduated with first-class honours in Digital Film and Video from London South Bank University. Spending 3 years writing, directing, producing and editing a variety of different projects. His film “Chess Club” was chosen as the film of the year by the faculty and nominated for Best Comedy Short at Screentest film festival.
 
Production Designer
George Chaffey is about to graduate from BA Textile Design at the world-renowned Central Saint Martins. In 2014 George was named as Young Fashion Designer of the Year; UK South. His work often revolves around ideas of light, colour, structure and how these elements can work within a space. Having worked on large-scale immersive installations and sets, George has found that his textile work has given him an additional view of how many different elements, materials and techniques can combine to create visual impact. In addition to his 3D work, George has continued his woven textile designs, investigating how these traditional approaches can be integrated with technologies and new materials.
 
Costume Designer 
Hannah Snaith has just finished her second year in the BA Painting course at UAL Camberwell and is taking a year out before she finishes her degree. She has worked as a poster artist on the director Lata's previous plays, and as a costume and prop supervisor for 'Not About Heroes'. Her love of shopping will be very useful in creating the costumes for this play, as they will be sourced from vintage pound sales, charity shops, the high street, actor's wardrobes, and anywhere else she can get her hands on clothing to create the medieval-esque outfits for this Richard III/modern day crossover rendition of Shakespeare's play.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am an awareness creator inspired by the words of poet Amiri Baraka who said the social is a catalyst for art.</p>
<p>As a mother of a child with mild autism, I have personally faced the challenges of lack of services and support, having taken the route of obtaining services in the private sector.  I'm lucky that as a family, we could afford to do that; that I could be a stay-at-home mother guiding all aspects of my son's development and growth.  My son has flourished.  But what about all the people who don't have that luxury, people who have children with severe autism?  </p>
<p>I've also been frustrated by a society that is increasingly aware of autism in general but still does not take full steps towards acceptance and inclusion.  I think that while awareness has grown dramatically, the general public still has a lack of understanding of the diversity within the world of autism and lacks a capacity or willingness to truly include people with autism into their lives; their circle of friends; their workplaces.  I'm pushing for a world beyond awareness to truly discovering autistic individuals for who they are and integrating them into daily life beyond family and caretakers.</p>
<p><strong>The Autism Monologues</strong> is a play that I wrote with those many ideas in mind.  The play is running at the 2018 St-Ambroise Festival FRINGE de Montreal. </p>
<p><i>I need your help</i> to fund the production so that we can do our best to entertain and enlighten the public.  The better the show is, the more it will get talked about, the more we can talk about acceptance and inclusion.  You will be a partner in my endeavour to awaken people to the struggles families face because of lack of governement funding and support, the obstacles autistic people face to true inclusion and integration, and the possibilities of joy and compassion that can make our communities, schools and places of employment more open to neurodiversity. </p>
<p><i>Will you join me in this struggle?</i>  I, we, cannot succeed without you.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>The total project budget is $5,180.  This includes salaries for 10 artists and collaborators (director, 5 actors, stage manager, set designer, light designer &amp; sound designer.  Discover the team at <a href=""http://www.theautismmonologues.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.theautismmonologues.com</a>).  It also includes the set design elements and props,  rehearsal space, marketing costs (graphic design, promotional cards and posters, and a show program) and the Fringe Festival participation fee.</li>
<li>I am making a personal investment of $3,000 in this production.  A studio residence from Montreal, arts interculturels will save us $675 in rental fees for a rehearsal space. </li>
<li>Because the salaries the team members are receiving are so low - below living wages if measured on an hourly basis and compared to union rates - the revenue from ticket sales will be split evenly between all the members of the team to help boost their income.  The value of the work and the time they put in is important to recognize and to respect.</li>
<li>The total amount I need to fundraise as the producer in order to cover the production costs is $1,505.</li>
<li>Depending on the amount you donate, you can receive free tickets to the show and/or a copy of the artwork from our poster.</li>
<li>Regardless of whether or not we reach our fundraising goal, the production will move forward.  The show must go on!!!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>As with my past play Dreaming in Autism, my goal is to have autism talked about in the media and to have the issues of lack of services and acceptance raised.  With my last show, I was able to have autism talked about on radio in English and French and in newspapers.  </li>
<li>The audience members will come away with a new experience about autism and hopefully have new attitudes that lend support to families and autistic people.</li>
<li>An important factor about this production is <strong>inclusion</strong>.  We have an actor who is on the autism spectrum.  We also have artists taking part who are ethnically diverse, Afro- and Asian-Canadians.  Lastly, roughly only a fifth of plays produced are directed or written by women.  In this case, we have a women director and a woman playwright.</li>
<li>You must visit <a href=""http://www.latigressaproductions.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.latigressaproductions.com</a> to see all the work that I've done as a playwright, actor and producer so you can feel confident that your donation is going to a good project.</li>
<li>As a mother of a child with autism, I'm passionate about this project and I hope you'll join in this theatrical event.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As with any work of art, evaluation is subjective.  Some may love the show, some may hate it.  That is the reality every artist faces puting their creation out there for the public to see.  What I can promise is that this show is being produced with every care in the world.  It is a personal issue for me.  What I want to do, what all the team members want to do, is to make autism shine</p>

<h2>The Abstract</h2>
<h3>Why Drag?</h3>
<p>Drag is one of the few art-forms that incorporates all facets of the artistic world. Visual art, performance, music, film, story-telling, dance, fashion, singing, acting, and makeup are all accessible through drag.  It's a wide range of possibility that gives an artist complete creative freedom, making drag one of the most powerful modes of creative expression of our time.</p>
<h3>Why Millicent?</h3>
<p>Millicent, created by Paul Regan, isn't as much a character as she is a statement against the reigning notion that drag should act as an escape.  While this notion is valid in it's own right, and has undoubtedly helped countless people through horrible circumstances, Millicent believes that there also exists a community of people who find solace, not through escape, but through being challenged to think, challenged to feel, challenged to question and challenged to experience the uncomfortable rawness of vulnerability both in others and within themselves.  Millicent is a means of reaching these people - the shy ones, the insecure ones, the emotionally raw members of the LGTBQ+ community, largely underrepresented and wholly misunderstood - so that they might understand that their voices matter, and that their voices need to be heard.</p>
<h3>Why Look Queen?</h3>
<p>Millicent's ongoing creative development is thanks largely to Look Queen.  The competition's loose requirements and its emphasis on creative performance allows her the freedom to express her drag in a way that is meaningful to her. Her entry into the competition's finale in August is an extension of this - the expression of her drag on a larger scale - a way to further her growth and expand her platform.</p>
<h2>The Concrete</h2>
<h3>How much money?</h3>
<p>$3,000</p>
<h3>Why so much?</h3>
<p>Visual spectacle is a huge component of drag.  Not only is it an art-form and means of creative expression in and of itself, but it also acts as a visual primer - a hook by which an audience can be immediately transported into the world that the performer is trying to convey.  The downside?  Visuals are outrageously expensive.</p>
<h3>What will my money pay for?</h3>
<p>Three different costumes (a requirement of the competition) constructed from head to toe by Millicent.</p>
<p>-- (This includes - fabric, trimmings, needles, thread, zippers, Velcro, wigs, shoes, stockings, corsets, pattern drafting supplies/test fabric, hooks &amp; eyes, hot glue, jewelry, costume-lenses, hats and more)</p>
<p>Pay for musicians - Millicent's performance number (the largest component of the competition) requires the help of two live musicians.</p>
<p>-- (Pay for them would include multiple rehearsals, travel expense, food and of course the performance itself)</p>
<p>Equipment - Millicent's performance number also requires the help of sound equipment.</p>
<p>-- (Specifically - An amp, a microphone complete with stand, and extension chords)</p>
<p>Promotion - Visual promotion via a strong online presence is essential to audience building.  While not directly tied to Look Queen, it nonetheless plays a vital role in what Millicent hopes to achieve as a drag performer and as a contestant.</p>
<p>-- (This includes lighting equipment and backdrops)</p>
<h3>How will I know that my money is well spent?</h3>
<p>Anyone who donates $5 or more will receive a link to a Google Sheet where Millicent will be documenting each and every project-related transaction.  There will be absolutely no doubt as to where your money is going.</p>
<h3>And If I can't donate?</h3>
<p>You can still help by sharing this campaign with others, by keeping in touch with Millicent through social media and by appearing at the Manhattan Monster Bar on Sunday August 26th to cheer for Millicent until your vocal chords snap.</p>

Lighting and Sound- Shawl Anderson is a dance school normally, and we are turning it into a multi faceted performance venue. With appropriate equipment rented, we can create an environment that is both comfortable and transporting. 

Stage Management/Show Flow Support- Move Here will move audiences through multiple areas of the dance center. Having a stage manager will help the show run smoothly and have all the details tended to. 



Please check out our PERKS, we would love to include you in our Fog Beast community and show our appreciation for your generosity.


Your contributions will help us take grow into this new phase of our dancing lives.  In addition to dancing in others' projects, we are now realizing our own ideas of what a live art event can be.  Your generosity gives Fog Beast its legs, wings, fangs and pulsing heart.
Thanks so much! Please consider sharing this page, talk about our show with friends that might be interested, and COME to Move Here on October 19,20,27,28!!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>I am graduating from the University of Montana this May with my BFA in dance. To complete my degree I am collaborating with other artists to put on a show that will be presented in an art gallery, The Artist Shop, on May 3rd in downtown Missoula, MT. The show is a collaboration between myself and other artists including William Munoz (photographer), Meghan Nolt (photographer), Aaron Minnick (music composer), Claire Christensen (dancer), Allison Herther (dancer), Amelia Hufsmith (dancer), Kaitlin Kinsley (dancer), Morgan Mull-Osborn (dancer), Amanda Pool (dancer) and Ellie Weinman (dancer). </p>
<p>We are combining our art forms to create an evening of live dance, photography, video projection, and original music composition. The small space of The Artist Shop will offer the audience an intimate experience.  Performance as installation removes the 4<sup>th</sup> wall of a proscenium stage and the audience is interactive with the dancers.  There’s little distinction between audience and performer.</p>
<p>Why now?  Why me?  Why this project?</p>
<p>This is the first time I am presenting work outside of the University. It is a wonderful opportunity for my artistic growth as an emerging artist in my community. For the past five years I have been investigating my creative voice. I constanly question  myself why I want to create dance. Some of the reasons are to reach people, to question our society or to simply admire a moving body. Dance is my medium to create challenging and hopefully inspiring conversations about our world.</p>
<p>In order for this show to be successful my collaborators and I need help! Your contributions will be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>What will they go toward?</p>
<p>- Prints of photographs</p>
<p>- Costumes: fabric</p>
<p>- Advertising</p>
<p>We feel very grateful to have the support of the University of Montana dance department for rehearsal space and the use of a projector.</p>
<p>Funds raised over our goal amount will go directly towards the hard work of the dancers, photographers, and music composer.</p>

<h3>Speak Easy Secrets</h3>
<h3>This may be the first immersive ballet performance ever!</h3>
<p>So take the jitney to the juice joint and go knock knees with all the Hoofers on the East Side.</p>
<p>This is my first large-scale work in London, after many years of successful evenings of dance in NYC. I am collaborating with a team of amazing women to create an interactive performance as we create a new context for ballet that makes it available to a wider public. This performance takes off from my work in NYC as President of Norte Maar (<a href=""http://www.nortemaar.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.nortemaar.org</a>) where collaboration is at the heart of every project. But this is the first time I am doing it in London (with a little long-distance help from Norte Maar).</p>
<p>I always dreamed of working with my strong female friends on a production, offering opportunities to ballet dancers, especially those that have diverse backgrounds (some might say, the dissatisfied ballet dancers). Ballet is a tough career and with new contexts it can be brought into focus in more communities as the relevant, living dance form it can be. </p>
<p>We will transform the theatre with raised performance area and cabaret seating. The performance will begin for each audience member upon entering the venue, passing through rooms with different scenes, waiters and dancers manipulating the action: some action framed for audience to witness, some involving them. The story revolves around 2 women, 2 men, and their changing relationships – partly performance-framed, partly voyeuristic. Are they ordinary guests? Evelyn's a socialite. She's friends with Geraldine, a bit of a wallflower. They're on a double date with inventor, Clarence and Frank, who doesn't like to say what he does for a living.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why am I asking you to help us fund this production?</h3>
<p>Ballet is expensive to produce. We intend to give it a new attitude and provide a few more jobs. There are a large number of graduates who are eager to create and to perform. And there is a demand. Barking (East London) has an eager audience. I intend to create a new life for a ballet that is contemporary in its outlook, accessible in its presentation and joyful. Theatre can be a celebration of wonder as all the parts come together and provide a world of experience.  I have dreamed of creating a theatre in which the audience feels as involved as the dancers, where sitting in the dark is not restrictive and distractions become part of the action. My team and I can make this happen, but the costs are high. </p>
<p>We need money for people. The people who create the show. They are the show and their commitment is most often unmet by the fees they are paid. I intend to use this money to pay them for their time and their creativity.</p>
<ul>
<li>stage management (this is a complex show and requires multiple management points).</li>
<li>designers and their materials.</li>
<li>a lighting designer who will be working in a non-traditional dance setting with new angles and opportunities.</li>
<li>dancers fees.</li>
</ul>
<p>And the perks are awesome. A walking tour with Michelle Buckley is the perfect way to discover London. And who knows what kind of Speakeasy ""thank you"" you might receive during the show!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Owasso High School Drama Department has been selected as one of the top high schools to represent the United States at the American High School Theatre Festival in Edinburgh, Scotland August 2013. As part of the International Fringe Festival (the world's largest arts festival), students will get the chance to perform in front of an international audience and experience art from over 2,000 different companies from around the world. </p>
<p>You can make a difference! Our school has already raised over $60,000 by completing 34 different fundraisers this year, and we only have $13,000 left to raise by June 14. Please make a difference in these kids lives. If you want the arts to thrive in the US, invest in our youth!</p>
<p>We are developing an original theatre piece that captures the relationship contemporary Oklahomans have with our history. The following is a detailed description of the story:</p>
<p>""On July 5,1870 the Osage Reservation was established and built a house near Pawhuska, Oklahoma: Twin Oaks. The people begin to die at an alarming rate due to the lack of supplies and the unexpectedly cold Oklahoma winters. White Feather, the last of the Osage Spider Guardian needs supernatural help to save her people. 140 years later, a modern day court case looms. A lawyer comes to stay at Twin Oaks, a house with many secrets. Emily, his daughter, simply wants to complete her art portfolio and get out of this po-dunk town as soon as possible, but she feels a connection to the house and its mysteries, especially to a ghost who still protects it. White Feather has come back from the world of the spirits and she needs Emily's help to see her people's memory safe into the next century, and beyond. ""</p>
<p>Written by Jennifer Steen Wendorf based on a novel by her mother, The Ghost of Twin Oaks, will be a captivating performance for all ages. This one-act has a running time of 60 minutes and includes creative staging, costumes, and set on a shoe-string budget. Most of our expenses result from travel and boarding. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p>
<p>As part of the program, each student and chaperone needs to raise $6,445 to cover the cost of airfare, lodging, meals, ground transportation, and production costs. As this is part of the world's largest arts festival, all of those items are at a high value this time of year in Edinburgh. We have 9 students and 4 chaperones scheduled to attend. We a so close to our goal and you can help! In exchange, we have the following gifts for you:</p>
<p>$25 pledge = Special thanks in our international playbill, copy of video, 2 tickets to any performance.</p>
<p>$100= Special thanks in our international playbill, copy of video, signed cast photo, 4 tickets</p>
<p>$300=  ½ page ad in our international program, copy of video, 8 tickets, Signed cast photo</p>
<p>$500= Full page ad in our international program, copy of video, 8 tickets, and a signed cast photo</p>
<p>The good news is that even if we don't reach our goal, the funds still go toward the students' trips. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The entire purpose behind our theatre program is to build empathy in our students. The process of creating a character requires that you imagine a different world than your own, you must step outside of yourself and look at the needs of others. In addition to this, students will be exposed to artists from around the world operating on a shoe-string budget. Every space is cannabalized for art during the Fringe Frestival. They will see how a restaurant, a hallway, and a street corner can all be platforms for artistic expression. They will come home empowered; knowing that they are capable of creating their own artistic opportunities. They will also remember the great gifts that theatre, music, and dance are for the world community. Through those, we begin to see life from another person's perspective. </p>

<p><i>We Were Here</i> was inspired by the true stories of Donna Harvey, Jean Dreckman, Susan Page, and Delena Jensen, who served in the American Defense Industry during WWII. Through interviews and research, playwright Rachell Campbell compiled their stories to create a ""friendship play."" Before Rachell interviewed Susie, now in her 90's, her daughter Tina said, ""I am so glad you are talking to her. This may be the last time she ever tells her story to someone who doesn't already know it.""

</div> <div> <h3>The Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> Every project will have its ups and downs. This production has been three years in the making. Two of the actors have been with the playwright since the play's inception and we have a solid group of artists who make up the team in its entirety. The biggest difficulty we face is time. Because we are a volunteer-based operation were are attempting to keep time commitments low. This means that we have a shorter rehearsal period than is usually done for shows of this length. It should not be an issue, as our cast and crew are ready for the challenge, but it could be a cause for concern. We are combatting this by doing as much work remotely as possible. The actors will be doing their character work and memorization off-site. Sets, props etc... will be ready upon the first rehearsal so that blocking can begin immediately. We are taking every precaution to make sure that our short timeline will be a blessing and not a deterrent.</p>

<h3>Brenda, You Say?! </h3>
<p>Cory and Ashley have been developing this play since Fall 2012. It grew out of our desire to colloborate, and we've nourished it with nearly a year's worth of brainstorms, rewrites, and late-night planning sessions.</p>
<p>The show is set to premiere in the New York International Fringe Festival this August. It's an ambitious project -- a big creative challenge that requires a substantial amount of money for production. That's why we need your help!</p>
<p>BRENDA follows Wallace, who's fled his chaotic Kentucky family and is living a lonely little life in Denver. When a delayed flight makes him miss his mother's funeral, his suppressed guilt begins haunting his body and transforming it in startling ways. Soon, Wallace, his deadbeat roommate, and his reluctant coworker are launched into a desperate cross-country road trip back home. BRENDA is a demented black comedy about what we owe the people who gave us life, and how we face the inevitability of death. </p>
<p>Ashley is a director/producer/stage manager who has developed shows at Ars Nova, the New York Fringe Festival, and Yale University and has worked at Manhattan Theatre Club, The Public, and on Broadway with Richards/Climan. </p>
<p>Cory is a playwright whose work has been produced and developed at and by Ars Nova, Theater for the New City, ACT Theater (Seattle), The Brick, and Yale University. He's a member of Youngblood, the playwrights' group at Ensemble Studio Theater. </p>
<p>Any amount that you contribute will help us get that much closer to producing our show in the Fringe. As young artists in New York, we rarely have opportunities like this to mount not a reading or a workshop but a fully-staged production. Thank you in advance for your help!</p>

When a delayed flight makes him miss his mother's funeral, his suppressed guilt begins haunting his body and transforming it in startling ways. Soon, Wallace, his deadbeat roommate, and his reluctant coworker are launched into a desperate cross-country road trip back home. BRENDA is a demented black comedy about what we owe the people who gave us life, and how we face the inevitability of death. 
Ashley is a director/producer/stage manager who has developed shows at Ars Nova, the New York Fringe Festival, and Yale University and has worked at Manhattan Theatre Club, The Public, and on Broadway with Richards/Climan. 
Cory is a playwright whose work has been produced and developed at and by Ars Nova, Theater for the New City, ACT Theater (Seattle), The Brick, and Yale University. He's a member of Youngblood, the playwrights' group at Ensemble Studio Theater. 
Any amount that you contribute will help us get that much closer to producing our show in the Fringe. As young artists in New York, we rarely have opportunities like this to mount not a reading or a workshop but a fully-staged production. Thank you in advance for your help!

<p><em>TREASURE ISLAND</em> is a widely-loved, influential classic literary work that is significantly responsible for lasting popular perceptions of pirate culture. Imbued with atmospheric period and nautical slang, <em>TREASURE ISLAND</em> is an action-packed buccaneer’s epic about fortune hunting, daring exploits, and sailing the open seas.

Our adaptation of <em>TREASURE ISLAND</em> stays true to Stevenson’s darkly iconic imagery through period pirate slang, language accuracy, authentic use of nautical song, and carefully crafted action choreography.

<h3>About Red Letter Jesus</h3>
<p>       ""Who do people say that I am?  What about you?  Who do you say I am?""<br/><br/>              Some people loved him; others hated him...What do you think?<br/><br/><i>Red Letter Jesus</i> is a deeply moving new show of Jesus' words from the synoptic gospels (Matthew, Mark, and Luke) performed with an original multimedia presentation, including stunning videography captured throughout Israel and Jordan. </p>
<p>The show will star Atlanta-based actor Brad Sherrill who devotes eight months of the year to the ongoing U.S. tour of his faith-based theater work. <i>Red Letter Jesus</i> is Sherrill's third live theatrical offering based on biblical texts. He has performed The Gospel of John over 600 times, including a run off-Broadway. Sherrill also recently premiered his original adaptation of Prophets, based on the texts of Isaiah and Jeremiah, at Georgia Shakespeare (Atlanta, 2010).</p>
<p>In 2011 and 2013, Sherrill and his videographer/designer Mark Hickman traveled to Israel and Jordan to gather multimedia for Red Letter Jesus.  The majority of the multimedia for the performance consists of original images and video footage, which Hickman gathered in Israel, the West Bank and Jordan during these time periods.</p>
<p>Hickman’s visual imagery and soundscape is designed not merely to draw us into the era and the geography surrounding Jesus’ ministry, but also to convey some of the Gospel stories which the red letters alone cannot communicate.</p>

<p><strong>About me</strong></p>
<p>Hi everyone. My name is Dahn and I'm a playwright, performance artist and visual artist from Brooklyn, NY. I'm also an art instructor, making my living as an adjunct professor of art at various New York area colleges. I've also been a gay rights and AIDS activist for over 25 years, and some of those themes are incorporated into my work. My dream is to have <em>Murmurs and Incantations</em>--a play very close to my heart--produced and shared with a wider audience.</p>
<div><em> </em></div>
<div>
<em><br/></em><strong>About the play<br/></strong>
</div>
<div><strong> </strong></div>
<div>
<em>Murmurs and Incantations </em>tells the story of an artist with creative block who fatefully travels to Eastern Europe in an attempt to revive his art career, only to be further confounded by the disapproving ghost of his grandfather, a rabbi killed in the Holocaust.
<p>Harrowing, poignant and irreverently funny, <em>Murmurs and Incantations</em> explores the anguish and the responsibility of being an artist. It sharply examines the ways in which identity, family and cultural history and personal baggage affect, impede and shape the creative process. Theatrically, <em>Murmurs and Incantations</em> is groundbreaking in its meaningful incorporation of performance art into both the form and content of the play.</p>
As the play’s action largely takes place in art spaces, <em>Murmurs and Incantations’</em> site-specific staging in a Chelsea gallery is a natural fit. Audiences are offered an exciting immersive experience, migrating from scene to scene in the real spaces of the art world. In addition to music, played live in the gallery spaces by its composer, the piece includes live video, installation-like sets, and audience participation, making for a richly textured evening of contemporary performance.<br/><p>I am so very lucky to have an Academy award-winning composer, Yuval Ron, composing original music, Tony Award-nominated director, Eleanor Reissa, as creative consultant, and a wonderful team of very gifted performers.</p>
<p>The play will be performed on Wednesday, August 21 and Thursday, August 22, 2013 at 8pm, at Mixed Greens Gallery, 531 West 26 Street, 1st Floor, NYC 10001.</p>

About the play

 

Murmurs and Incantations tells the story of an artist with creative block who fatefully travels to Eastern Europe in an attempt to revive his art career, only to be further confounded by the disapproving ghost of his grandfather, a rabbi killed in the Holocaust.
Harrowing, poignant and irreverently funny, Murmurs and Incantations explores the anguish and the responsibility of being an artist. It sharply examines the ways in which identity, family and cultural history and personal baggage affect, impede and shape the creative process. Theatrically, Murmurs and Incantations is groundbreaking in its meaningful incorporation of performance art into both the form and content of the play.
As the play’s action largely takes place in art spaces, Murmurs and Incantations’ site-specific staging in a Chelsea gallery is a natural fit.

In addition to music, played live in the gallery spaces by its composer, the piece includes live video, installation-like sets, and audience participation, making for a richly textured evening of contemporary performance.I am so very lucky to have an Academy award-winning composer, Yuval Ron, composing original music, Tony Award-nominated director, Eleanor Reissa, as creative consultant, and a wonderful team of very gifted performers.
The play will be performed on Wednesday, August 21 and Thursday, August 22, 2013 at 8pm, at Mixed Greens Gallery, 531 West 26 Street, 1st Floor, NYC 10001.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The Bushwick Dance Team has been created to give the opportunity to our students, who come from different socio economic, cultural and ethnic backgrounds, to be a part of a fun school and extracurricular activity. This Team will give the students the opportunity to interact with each other, to help students to build respect, to improve communication skills, to build trust with each other, to develop a sense of responsibility and punctuality, and to develop the skills that are needed to be an integral part of the community.</p>
<p>The dance Team is serving students from all grade levels. Our school is located in an economic disadvantage area of Bushwick serving students and families of this community. With very limited resources it is challenging for our students to find a space in which they can display their creativeness and final productions. The dance Team is essential to our students’ livelihood and academic success providing them with an outlet and the opportunities to be engaged in activities where they can demonstrate and utilize all their skills and talents. The goal is to have established a dance team that fosters multicultural artistic expressions through dance over the next two academic years. With the Dance Team we want to provide the students with a safe environment and to have them interested in participating in an activity they enjoy.</p>
<p>Imagine if you had been given this opportunity for a life-changing experience when you were in high school and were unable to participate for lack of funds. In order for the Bushwick Dance Team  to be able to achieve its goal, we need to equip our students with the necessary attire, which includes dance shoes, dance costumes and accessories, dance instructors and electronics. However, our resources are very limited but, our enthusiasm is immense. We are in need of <strong>$5, 000</strong> dollars to be able to get the necessary equipment to continue running our dance team through June and to showcase the dancers at multiple events outside of our campus.</p>
<p>Your support for a part or the entire generous donation would be greatly appreciated. At this time we really need and depend on your help.</p>

In order for the Bushwick Dance Team  to be able to achieve its goal, we need to equip our students with the necessary attire, which includes dance shoes, dance costumes and accessories, dance instructors and electronics. However, our resources are very limited but, our enthusiasm is immense. We are in need of $5, 000 dollars to be able to get the necessary equipment to continue running our dance team through June and to showcase the dancers at multiple events outside of our campus.
Your support for a part or the entire generous donation would be greatly appreciated. At this time we really need and depend on your help.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

The impact has already been great with our audiences. Here's what the reviewers said:

""It is a splendid tribute to some magnificent women performed by splendid actresses.""
Remotegoat

""Debbie Yearsley was outstanding and rather uncanny as the young Margaret Thatcher...The change in form and the songs make this production very lively. The cast is excellent...Director Alison Mead hopes that this production will showcase how women have shaped history and spark debate. I think she has succeeded. It definitely touches on many important issues that have not lost its relevance over the years.""

UK Theatre Network





Please help us to continue the debate! 


What We Need & What You Get
We are asking for just $5,000 (that's about £3000) to help mount this production.  This will go towards set design, costumes and printing up our flyers and posters. If we exceed our target we can also cover our venue hire. The rehearsal space has been very kindly donated!

<p>My name is Doug Knoop, I'm a Seattle native
 with deep roots in the local theater scene. Since my return to Seattle 
after college I've performed and directed all over the Puget Sound area.
  I formed KTO Productions to allow myself and other artists to stretch 
beyond their ""comfort zones"" and to create and perform projects they are
 passionate about.</p>
<p>In the fall of 2011, our inaugural production of Conor McPherson’s<b> 
“The Weir” </b>was a crowd pleaser and a critical success. In 2012 we presented <b>""'night mother"" </b>by Marsha Norman. <b>Talkin' Broadway</b> called it ""as gripping a 90 minutes as can be seen on any Seattle stage..."" while Jerry Kraft of <b>SeattleActor.com</b> said the show was “absolutely genuine and it left me genuinely moved.” </p>
<h3>Why ""Sea Marks""?</h3>
<p>Gardner McKay's 1982 drama tells the tale of a romance between an Irish fisherman and woman he's glimpsed only once. The play had been suggested several times by Toni Douglass (director of our production of <b>""The Weir""</b>) and this fall seems like the right time to share this drama with Seattle audiences.</p>

<h3>SHADOW Company</h3>
<p>We are a bunch of teens that like to create art. We reflect on our unique experiences and try to tell compelling stories that impact the world around us. We receive training and support from Yes! And... Collaborative Arts, who provide professional artists to train and guide us. We are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Teens, led by teens</li>
<li>Funny! (And sometimes serious)</li>
<li>Active in our communities</li>
</ul>
<p>During this next year, we want to focus on three plays we've already written and performed. We think they can be revised and edited into one full-length show but we need YOUR help to do it!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>
<i>Trials of Paradox</i>, <i>Bullseye!</i>, &amp; <i>Flash</i>
</h3>
<p>These three plays are our message to the world. They speak to tragedy, getting along, being human, and being a teen. The commonality in these pieces is what we want to explore this coming year.</p>
<p>We have to raise all of our funding for the entire year, and this Indiegogo campaign is just one part of our fundraising. We need the extra money to work with professional playwrights and directors to help us mold and shape this piece we are imagining. Here's where some of that money goes:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Just to participate in the Fringe Festival we need $500</span><br/>
</li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">To hire a professional playwright to do three workshops we need $300</span></li>
<li>Printing up posters is $100 and postcards is $300 (postage is another $250!)</li>
<li>Costumes and props can be anywhere from $200-$400</li>
<li>We spend $600 to rent a venue (more if we want it in Center City!)</li>
<li>Our director transports a lot of us! We like to fill her car with gas!</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>This is what we want to accomplish:</h3>
<p>As teens we have a unique voice in society. We enjoy shining a light into dark places. We believe this show can speak to the community of Philadelphia and beyond if we are successful. Our vision is to be able to take pieces of these shows to schools and community groups to encourage, uplift, and show other teens an alternative through the arts.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

To date we have produced four festivals featuring short plays and over twenty individual productions.</p><p>One of these new works, and the one that had by far the most impact on our audiences, was Alexander Moschos' play Brainville at Night, which was inspired by his experiences of caring for a lady with frontotemporal dementia. In my role as producer, I was very keen for the play to help promote awareness of the work of The Alzheimer's Society and so I invited their members to contribute to the programme notes as well as taking part in post-performance Q&amp;A sessions with audiences.</p><p>I distinctly remember being overwhelmed by the statistics surrounding Alzheimer's; not just the number of those living with dementia in the UK, but of course the thousands who work tirelessly as carers. As my eyes were opened further to the various forms of the disease (not to mention those who go undiagnosed), I knew that I wanted to do something further with First Draft to bring new productions of professional theatre to those in care centres outside London with little to no access to such entertainment.</p><p>At around the same time, my nan, Dot, was suffering with chronic arthritis and depression. Her anxiety meant that she could no longer be cared for at home and needed to live in an environment in which she could receive 24 hour care. Trying to find a suitable place for her was not an easy task; she was desperately unhappy about being unable to live the life she had known so well and to enjoy the social benefits of being around her family and friends.</p><p>Though she was not diagnosed with dementia, she displayed similar traits. Physical frailties, hallucinations and an inability to communicate her most basic needs were commonplace. I was determined to do something that might help to stimulate her mind and those of her fellow residents. Whenever I visited her during this time, we were both reminded of the first play I had ever put on: a spectacular one-woman show in my garden, when I was aged just 7, and with a ticket price of 2p! Ever since that time, she followed my career as an actress and producer avidly, and now here she was asking me what I was working on, and ""will you sing that song you used to sing?""</p><p>In September 2015, I asked my nan that if I were to bring a production to Sussex for her, what it was that she would want to see. Her reply was ""a bit of everything please - just like what you do in London"". And so, in December 2015, we toured our first production, The Snow Queen, to 10 care homes in East Sussex. Sadly, my nan passed away just one week before we visited her, yet the tour was an intensely humbling and rewarding experience for everyone involved and we were delighted that the care providers saw such positive reactions from their clients, and they emphasised the need and demand for this work to continue.</p><p>This is why I am now investing my time into developing our work with the hope of expanding it further across the UK in the near future. Our new charity will take professional theatre into care environments, with the hope that we can offer alternative stimulation and the experience of live theatre that is (hopefully!) entertaining for all, but also accessible to those living with dementia, learning difficulties and frailties. I am determined that these productions should be of little to no cost for the care centres and that they should look to be as adaptable as possible. We want to transform the everyday spaces of the residents – whether it be a living/dining room, garden or reception area – in the hope that they can enjoy professional theatre in a pop-up venue with the same level of production values that I would expect for any London theatre show I produce.</p><p>A new charity will be fully established by the end of September under the name ‘The Dot Collective’ and we hope that completing these formalities will make funding applications a little easier from then on. Unfortunately, we failed to receive any funding from The Arts Council, but that will not stop us from bringing our new show, A Midsummer Night's Dream to care centres across the South East this September. It will feature a specially adapted version of the Shakespeare text, with live music, dancing and interaction with the audience.</p><p>To make the tour possible we need to raise £8,000. This cost covers the set, stage, lighting, sound, five actors, van hire, petrol, three nights accommodation in Sussex, rehearsal room hire in London, a director, stage manager, producer, insurance, costume, instrument hire and props.</p><p>The Chalk Cliff Trust has generously donated £5,000 to our project, but obviously we still have a way to go. Any help towards achieving our goal will be hugely appreciated and, more importantly, will mean we can give the care homes the experience we know that they deserve.</p><p>Please spread the word of this campaign far and wide and don't hesitate to be in touch if you want any further information.

If we can't reach the entire goal, we would have to ask more adults and friends and somehow feel guilty in doing so because we didn't get enough scratch support, but you won't let this happen, I know it.  And you're still invited to come and celebrate with us!


The Impact
Why would you want to help?

Self Expression through dance!
The youth community are exposed to art and dance and has a passionate, positive venue for the creative mind and body to meet.
This is our 4th year doing this and every year it gets larger and create an awareness for the dance community around hampton roads area and bring in other neighboring city to network and compete all for the love of b-boying.

<p>The goal is to prepare an Off-Broadway production and present it for the Seniors at Mt.

<h3>HEARTS LIKE FISTS</h3>
<p><em>Hearts Like Fists</em> is a genre-bending world premiere love story written by <strong>Adam Szymkowicz</strong> and directed by Saturn Award winning director, Jaime Robledo that is set in a world of evil villains and beautiful crime fighters!</p>
<p>The evil Dr. X is stealing into lovers’ rooms and injecting them with a serum, stopping their hearts while they sleep entwined in the perceived safety of their lover's arms. And even though the beautiful and unstoppable Crime Fighters have been hot on his trail, they have been unable to capture him.   </p>
<p>Lisa, a woman who is desired by every man that sees her, has fallen in love with Peter, the ingenious but tortured doctor, who is about to finish his greatest creation - an artificial heart.  Since Peter can't let himself love, he loses himself in his work.  Since Lisa can't have Peter, she joins the Crime Fighters.</p>
<p>In this funny, stylized and vicious story, we learn that the heart wants what the heart wants and not answering its desires will lead to a life of sadness, loneliness and possibly evil destruction. </p>

<div>
<h3>A GIVING HEART</h3>
<p><em>Producing theatre is not an easy or cheap proposition.</em>  Your donation will not only help us bring this story to life for the first time but will also allow us to employ all the dedicated artists it takes to make quality theatre happen.</p>
<p>Your donation helps to employ 10 actors, a director, 5 designers, and a full production crew. For your donation, you could receive free tickets to the show, tickets to our ""Comic Strip"" Benefit evening on 6/23 in Silver Lake, our fabulous marketing package and other amazing incentives.</p>
<p>Every little bit helps us reach our goal and even if the full goal isn't met, your donation helps to offset the costs of a truly remarkable theatrical production.</p>

<h3>THE PRICE OF HEROISM</h3>
<p>Would you like to know where your donation is going to? Of course you do! So here's a breakdown of the expenses that we as producers have to cover for this show:</p>
<p>$1500 - Marketing and Advertising<br/>$3000 - Materials (set, costumes, props)<br/>$3000 - Designer Stipends<br/>$450  - Programs<br/>$750  - Rehearsal Space Rental</p>

<p>We at Theatre of NOTE are an enduring ensemble of diverse theatre artists in the heart of Hollywood who inspire, inform, and ignite our audiences by discovering courageous voices and creating entertaining, provocative, and revelatory theatrical works.</p>
<p>NOTE was founded in 1981 by Kevin Carr, along with Kitty Felde, Marc Gordon, Melanie MacQueen, Heather Carr and Ted Parks as a forum for original one-act plays (N.O.T.E. stood for “New One-Act Theatre Ensemble”), and to provide a stimulating environment for new playwrights. Since its inception, NOTE has been through several transitions, but the integrity of the original idea has always remained intact. We premiere an average of four main stage productions a year by writers such as W.H. Auden, Bertolt Brecht, Sheila Callaghan, Christopher Kelley, Tony Kushner, Jennifer Maisel, Leon Martell, Murray Mednick, Dennis Miles, John O’Keefe, Erik Patterson, Bill Robens and JacquelineWright. NOTE also upholds a tradition of acclaimed late-night shows, first launched in 1988, in addition to the now annual, notorious, celebrity-crowd art magnet, The Hollywood Performance Marathon. We have earned consistent commendation from theLos Angelespress and national acclaim from such publications as American Theatre. In all, NOTE has accumulated almost 100 honors and nominations, including awards from the LA WEEKLY, Backstage West, LA Stage Alliance (Ovations), and PEN International. Thanks to over 25 years of advancing theatre in Los Angeles, NOTE has received generous government and corporate support, including grants from the California Arts Council, the Cultural Affairs Department of Los Angeles, the Flintridge Foundation, the Libby Holman Foundation, the Los Angeles County Arts Commission, Robinson’s/May, Sedgwick James Inc., the Audrey Skirball-Kenis Foundation, Verizon, Time Warner and, most recently, The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce in recognition of our Young Writers Project, an outreach program benefiting local high school students.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p class=""Body"">
</p>ENDURE is immersive, outdoor athletic theatre. The piece
addresses themes of endurance, sport, obsession, loss and resilience – through a
human story set within the drama of a 26.2 mile marathon race. <span style=""""> </span>Audience members meet at the performance’s ‘start line’ and follow
Ms. Melanie Jones through a sonic, visual and physical journey. The audio acts
as both personal soundtrack (composed by Sweden’s Christine Owman) and internal
monologue, giving participants a voyeuristic peek inside a marathoner’s mind. 

<p class=""Body""> </p>
<p class=""Body"">The audience follows the performer across multiple
terrains as the play’s narrative unfolds, traveling through public park space
and trails. The performance is a blend of physical theatre, contemporary
dance and pure running that taps into both the physical and emotional
experience of endurance.</p>
<p class=""Body""> </p>
<p class=""Body"">After opening to a sold-out world premier in Brooklyn, NY, ENDURE will travel for a Western Canadian tour before returning to New York City for
an extended run in 2011-2012. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The show seeks to present a new type of ""immersive"" theatre experience to audiences.  ENDURE is a performance in motion. The audience are issued iPods prior to the performance beginning. While listening to 26.2 audio tracks of spoken narrative and original music in their headphones, both audience and performer move through space. A riveting physical theater performance tells a story and is supported by a lush audio world. The audience is free to walk or run alongside the performance and experience it from different perspectives as they choose.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need <br/>
</h3>During our Brooklyn, NY world premier, our audiences downloaded ENDURE audio tracks onto their iPods or other MP3 devices, and brought them along to the performance.  The audiences were then led through a somewhat excruciating sync process by our trusty ENDURE team, which was fraught with several technical errors and ""do-overs"" during the opening of the show.  <br/><br/>The ENDURE team thinks that if this could be done better for our audiences, the overall show experience would be dramatically improved.  So, this is where we need some help from you.  We've done a fair amount of research into alternate audience listening devices, and have found that there are many other more elegant options out there that the show could use.  However, they aren't cheap.  A specialized system designed for audio tours costs  $8,500 for 40 listening units plus another $4,000 to remix the audio for a mono mix plus another $1500 for headphones and batteries.   40 Ipod Nano's cost $6000, and fees to to hire a programmer to create a sync mechanism for the devices could easily cost another $4,000.    <br/><br/>Bottom line... we can't improve this system without investing somewhere in the neighborhood of $10,000.<br/><br/>So, this is why we need your help.  Every dollar of your contributions will help us get closer to the purchase of an audio system that can start ENDURE off the way that it should.  This performance needs to be about the amazing experiential journey that the audience travels with performer / creator Melanie Jones, and shouldn't be hampered by technical difficulties.   With your help, we can meet this challenge, so please contribute what you can.<br/><br/>Thanks for helping us ENDURE for the long run ahead!<br/><br/>

Company hits a significant landmark in our history, one that few indie theatre
companies in NYC will ever reach. We celebrate 12 years of making our signature
raw, evocative, engaging and authentic theatrical experiences. </p>
<p>As we embark on Season 12, we put
an emphasis on new works created from within the ensemble, including  The world premiere of Ice Age from resident
playwright Mike Aguirre, Original Devised work that we will present as guests
at festivals and special events, a return to the work in progress “Henry’s
Wives” along with two revivals of published works: Brilliant Traces by Cindy
Lou Johnson and the Remount of RSP’s inaugural production Hellcab by Will Kern.
<b>The next 4 months promises to be filled with many exciting moments on and
off stage </b>featuring the work of our talented ensemble, playwrights,
directors  and an immensely talented
design and support team.  Our Fall/Winter Season will run from October 30<sup>th</sup>
thru December 20<sup>th</sup>.  </p>
<p>We have existed this long by
working in the most cost effective and innovative ways possible. By the grace
of donors and grants, donated space, in kind costumes, and with the exceptionally
hard work of a 100% volunteer run staff and ensemble we have presented over 55
productions &amp; events.  However, as
cost effective as we run our company, we still need a significant amount of
funding in order to function as a viable company in NYC.  </p>

Company hits a significant landmark in our history, one that few indie theatre
companies in NYC will ever reach. We celebrate 12 years of making our signature
raw, evocative, engaging and authentic theatrical experiences. 
As we embark on Season 12, we put
an emphasis on new works created from within the ensemble, including  The world premiere of Ice Age from resident
playwright Mike Aguirre, Original Devised work that we will present as guests
at festivals and special events, a return to the work in progress “Henry’s
Wives” along with two revivals of published works: Brilliant Traces by Cindy
Lou Johnson and the Remount of RSP’s inaugural production Hellcab by Will Kern.
The next 4 months promises to be filled with many exciting moments on and
off stage featuring the work of our talented ensemble, playwrights,
directors  and an immensely talented
design and support team.  Our Fall/Winter Season will run from October 30th
thru December 20th.  
We have existed this long by
working in the most cost effective and innovative ways possible. By the grace
of donors and grants, donated space, in kind costumes, and with the exceptionally
hard work of a 100% volunteer run staff and ensemble we have presented over 55
productions & events.  However, as
cost effective as we run our company, we still need a significant amount of
funding in order to function as a viable company in NYC.  
IN ORDER FOR SEASON 12 TO HAPPEN,
WE MUST RAISE $10,000 WITHIN THE NEXT MONTH.

If you are a solo performer, not being able to afford the high fees and not being able to hire the needed personnel will prevent you from participating in the festivals that may help you get to the next level of your career.

Since many educational institutes in our community have had to severely cut arts programming in recent years, one of our largest goals is to further our success in bringing theatre to the students of these underprivileged schools through performances and workshops. <br/><br/><strong>Cardboard Playhouse</strong> believes strongly in the power of theatre arts to instill stronger community roots, educational desires, self-esteem, and imaginative possibilities for today's youth. We believe it is our responsibility as teachers and theatre artists to create opportunities for children and young adults to express themselves and reach their furthest potential in a safe and caring environment. We understand that these goals can seem lofty, especially to many underprivileged youth, but that without a strong and fulfilling sense of community responsibility, a majority of young adults lack faith in themselves and their own environment. Cardboard Playhouse uses a variety of approaches and techniques to teach Albuquerque's youth the possibilities for their own lives, and how art can reflect positively on a community as a whole.</p>
<p><strong>With your contribution</strong>, Cardboard Playhouse will have the ability to strengthen our outreach efforts towards raising awareness of the auditions, classes, and opportunities that are offered to Albuquerque youth, especially those who have had very little exposure to the performing arts. Although some of the efforts are through marketing and a stronger web presence, the most effective efforts are when Cardboard Playhouse is able to bring our productions into the public schools free of charge. There are very few students in our community that have had the experience of seeing a live theatrical performance, however, even fewer have had the inspirational opportunity of seeing a production that features students of their same age range and cultural background. We have found this reflection to be an important part of a students first experience with the performing arts. Cardboard Playhouse, with your generous support, will be providing more opportunities for students to not only grow as artists, but experience a heightened sense of esteem and expression, whether this be as a first time audience, or through the development as young theatre artists.</p>

Cardboard Playhouse does this by raising the standards of theatrical practice and providing an environment where youth of all ages feel confident and comfortable expressing themselves as artists and in their daily lives.

The Harbor Stage Company is Amanda, Bob, Stacy, Jonathan, Lewis, and Brenda- 6 theater artists determined to preserve and advance the legacy of progressive, engaging live performance on Wellfleet Harbor.  The company's artists double as its administrators, ensuring an operation that prioritizes the artistic process.     
 
The Impact
For almost 30 years, the iconic theater at 15 Kendrick has provided a haven for fierce, delightful theater.  It has been home to an incredible assortment of engaged and engaging artists, a group of whole-hearted, serious-minded collaborators who've sacrificed to keep the space's puckish spirit alive and kicking.  There's no place like the Harbor, and we think it's wrong to let it slip away. 
 
It took the Harbor's previous tenant decades to work up to presenting a full season of professional theater.  We're trying to pick up where they left off with about 70 days of prep. Think we're crazy?  Have a thing or two to tell us about what we're getting ourselves into? Please write your sentiments on a series of twenty dollar bills and mail them in.  We can't wait to hear your thoughts!
 
But Seriously...
We're determined to make the Harbor a place where art comes first,  tickets are affordable, and artists are fairly paid.  Ideals don't come cheap, so right now we're moving fast to meet a very serious budget- researching grants, courting sponsors, and learning to play online poker.  
 
Still we're going to need some extra help funding our inaugural season.  And this $10K online campaign represents only a small fraction of what we need to raise overall.  We know that many of you are artists and working stiffs yourselves, so we're grateful for whatever you can contribute. Every little bit will mean a lot to us, and to a community we think deserves to be celebrated and preserved.  We'll thank you for your support in our hearts, in line at the market, and in the sands of Wellfleet Harbor (see our perks section! →).

<p><b><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Burlesque-A-Pades 101</b></b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Burlesque-A-Pades</b> is a touring burlesque
and variety revue created by the World Famous Pontani Sisters in 2006.
 Over the years <b>Burlesque-A-Pades</b> has been hard at work spreading the
glamour gospel and bringing the best of burlesque to venues throughout the USA.
 As one of the first neo-burlesque productions to hit the glittery
highway, <b>Burlesque-A-Pades</b> has been a trail blazing show, often bringing burlesque to markets that haven't seen a tail feather or panel skirt in
over 30 years.  Keeping the art of burlesque alive and sharing it is our
passion!  Not only do we present
top-notch performers, we reinvent classic burlesque skits and incorporate all
cast production numbers into each and every show. <b>Burlesque-A-Pades</b> is our version
of a true golden age burlesque revue for the modern generation.  This style of burlesque was and is a unique
form of American entertainment, we want to keep it alive and share it with the
world, but this December we need your help to make our 14 city tour shine!  </p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>We need funding to take <b>Burlesque-A-Pades</b> to the next
level! We love our show, but we want to make it bigger and better! Over the
years, touring has become more costly, and changes in the entertainment
industry make it hard for independent shows like ours to stay afloat. But we
are sashaying on and hoping that with your support we can grow our show. This
December we are taking on one of our most ambitious tours to date, we have
expanded our cast so that we can serve up more production numbers and variety
all month long.  With an expanded cast
comes more cost, but most importantly, a portion of the funds raised here will
go towards covering a van to transport our cavalcade of stars as well as our
set, props and costumes. </p>
<p>The remainder of these funds will be used to support our
tour with an advertising budget. This is something we have never had before, but could be
pivotal in increasing our success and ensuring the growth of our show.  Advertising in select markets will be key in
helping <b>Burlesque-A-Pades</b> fan kick through the ceiling and into your town year
after year! </p>
<p>Plus we are
offering amazing perks! Giving was never so good! Not only are you supporting
the arts and an amazing show, you can get great gifts, like a private tap
dancing lesson with Helen Pontani, a signed Go-Go Robics I DVD, or even a nice
Italian dinner in NYC with the entire cast!</p>
<p>Every
little bit helps, and every single penny earned here will go to support this
show as we spread the glamour gospel this December. </p>
<p><b>Why?</b></p>
<p>Live
entertainment is a rare opportunity to share a moment with your favorite artist
or to experience something totally new in the flesh. Seeing <b>Burlesque-A-Pades</b>
is drinking from the well of this unique and uniquely American form of
theatrical entertainment.  By donating to
our cause, you aren’t only helping our show, you are helping to support the
medium of live entertainment and to solidify the position of burlesque as a
true genre of entertainment.<br/></p>
<p>Well what
can I say folks, the show must go on, help us make it happen!</p>

Burlesque-A-Pades is a touring burlesque
and variety revue created by the World Famous Pontani Sisters in 2006.
 Over the years Burlesque-A-Pades has been hard at work spreading the
glamour gospel and bringing the best of burlesque to venues throughout the USA.
 As one of the first neo-burlesque productions to hit the glittery
highway, Burlesque-A-Pades has been a trail blazing show, often bringing burlesque to markets that haven't seen a tail feather or panel skirt in
over 30 years.  Keeping the art of burlesque alive and sharing it is our
passion!  Not only do we present
top-notch performers, we reinvent classic burlesque skits and incorporate all
cast production numbers into each and every show. Burlesque-A-Pades is our version
of a true golden age burlesque revue for the modern generation.  This style of burlesque was and is a unique
form of American entertainment, we want to keep it alive and share it with the
world, but this December we need your help to make our 14 city tour shine!  
What We Need & What You Get
We need funding to take Burlesque-A-Pades to the next
level! We love our show, but we want to make it bigger and better! Over the
years, touring has become more costly, and changes in the entertainment
industry make it hard for independent shows like ours to stay afloat. But we
are sashaying on and hoping that with your support we can grow our show. This
December we are taking on one of our most ambitious tours to date, we have
expanded our cast so that we can serve up more production numbers and variety
all month long.  With an expanded cast
comes more cost, but most importantly, a portion of the funds raised here will
go towards covering a van to transport our cavalcade of stars as well as our
set, props and costumes. 
The remainder of these funds will be used to support our
tour with an advertising budget. This is something we have never had before, but could be
pivotal in increasing our success and ensuring the growth of our show.  Advertising in select markets will be key in
helping Burlesque-A-Pades fan kick through the ceiling and into your town year
after year! 
Plus we are
offering amazing perks! Giving was never so good! Not only are you supporting
the arts and an amazing show, you can get great gifts, like a private tap
dancing lesson with Helen Pontani, a signed Go-Go Robics I DVD, or even a nice
Italian dinner in NYC with the entire cast!
Every
little bit helps, and every single penny earned here will go to support this
show as we spread the glamour gospel this December. 
Why?
Live
entertainment is a rare opportunity to share a moment with your favorite artist
or to experience something totally new in the flesh. Seeing Burlesque-A-Pades
is drinking from the well of this unique and uniquely American form of
theatrical entertainment.  By donating to
our cause, you aren’t only helping our show, you are helping to support the
medium of live entertainment and to solidify the position of burlesque as a
true genre of entertainment.
Well what
can I say folks, the show must go on, help us make it happen!

Besides working as an administrator, teacher, and dancer, I have increasingly been given more opportunities to choreograph on professionals and budding artists throughout the years and with each and every opportunity have had the need to give back to the dance community more and more. Making dances for me is a chance to share, support, and encourage each other as artists to keep pushing the boundaries of not only our art form but of who we are as people. Only then will we really inspire audiences to continue giving the love, support, and let's face it, resources, to an art form that deserves more exposure. For me, there are no back-up dancers behind Beyonce, there are just dancers, and the only way to continue giving our art form that presence in the world is in continuing to support the youth and education.</p><p><b>the Wolfe project</b> <b>began</b> with this platform three years ago when a group of ten artists plus myself traveled to my hometown in Champion, Ohio to put on three shows as a fundraiser. Not only was this the first opportunity I had to showcase my work but it was also for a cause very close to my heart. All the funds raised benefited the scholarship fund my two sisters and I started in my Mom's name to award two scholarships every year: 1) to a student seeking higher education and 2) to a student seeking to further his/her dance education and training. When my Mom passed from cancer, it was one of the most difficult moments in my life. However, what she left me with was a passion to keep going as she kept going through all of life's struggles. My Dad is a constant reminder of this passion and that hard work and love for people is the only way to build a life to be proud of and enjoy living. My goal is to have the Wolfe project assimilate a similar role for others and support those that are dreaming as big as I did when I first moved to NYC through philanthropic endeavors.</p><p>For the last three years, I have worked at Peridance Capezio Center as the Certificate Program Coordinator. Besides playing an integral part in designing the infrastructure of the Program and managing daily affairs, I proudly act as mentor and adviser to students from 20+ countries with a variety of backgrounds, personal circumstances, and career aspirations. In speaking with student after student, money is of constant concern; Survival is the name of the game. Money holds each student back from receiving the high quality and well-rounded training and education needed to be conscious professional dancers and business people. It also just makes having a reasonable standard of living in an inflated city that much harder. I am inspired by the generosity of Igal Perry, Artistic Director, who does everything he can to organize financial aid for Certificate Program students in many forms and I would like to contribute. </p><p>On August 3, 2014, a team of artists, otherwise known as the Wolfe pack - </p><p><i>Dani-Juliet Atkinson, Shay Bares, Sara Braun, Katarina Lott, Melinda Moeller, Jackie Nowicki, Mikelle Rindflish, Suzie Rzecznik, Lynda Senisi, Mary Kate Sheehan, Daron Wehle, Marlena Wolfe, and special guest choreographers and artists </i></p><p><i>- </i>are coming together to do just that. There will be two shows (3:30p &amp; 7:00p) and all tickets sales for this event will be given in Scholarship money to Certificate Program students.</p><p>As I seek new endeavors and plan to move to the Netherlands on August 11, I desire to leave a decade in New York with a bang and begin to give back to all those who supported and paved the way for me by passing it forward. Not to mention my 30th birthday is just two days before on August 1! This event is a time for reflection, celebration, and forward-thinking, and all that I ask is that you join the Wolfe pack. </p><p></p><p>With heartfelt gratitude,</p><p>Marlena</p><p><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;"">_________________________________________________</span><br/></p><p><br/></p>This indiegogo campaign is solely to cover the expenses of preparing, producing, and executing the two shows at Peridance Capezio Center's Salvatore Capezio Theater on August 3, 2014 at 3:30p and 7:30p. Please donate what you can... $1, $20, $50, $100.

<p></p><p></p></div>","letter from Marlena WolfeHello all! For those of you who don't know me, my name is Marlena Wolfe and I have been working as a professional artist in dance for 10 years in NYC. Besides working as an administrator, teacher, and dancer, I have increasingly been given more opportunities to choreograph on professionals and budding artists throughout the years and with each and every opportunity have had the need to give back to the dance community more and more. Making dances for me is a chance to share, support, and encourage each other as artists to keep pushing the boundaries of not only our art form but of who we are as people. Only then will we really inspire audiences to continue giving the love, support, and let's face it, resources, to an art form that deserves more exposure. For me, there are no back-up dancers behind Beyonce, there are just dancers, and the only way to continue giving our art form that presence in the world is in continuing to support the youth and education.the Wolfe project began with this platform three years ago when a group of ten artists plus myself traveled to my hometown in Champion, Ohio to put on three shows as a fundraiser. Not only was this the first opportunity I had to showcase my work but it was also for a cause very close to my heart. All the funds raised benefited the scholarship fund my two sisters and I started in my Mom's name to award two scholarships every year: 1) to a student seeking higher education and 2) to a student seeking to further his/her dance education and training. When my Mom passed from cancer, it was one of the most difficult moments in my life. However, what she left me with was a passion to keep going as she kept going through all of life's struggles. My Dad is a constant reminder of this passion and that hard work and love for people is the only way to build a life to be proud of and enjoy living. My goal is to have the Wolfe project assimilate a similar role for others and support those that are dreaming as big as I did when I first moved to NYC through philanthropic endeavors.For the last three years, I have worked at Peridance Capezio Center as the Certificate Program Coordinator. Besides playing an integral part in designing the infrastructure of the Program and managing daily affairs, I proudly act as mentor and adviser to students from 20+ countries with a variety of backgrounds, personal circumstances, and career aspirations. In speaking with student after student, money is of constant concern; Survival is the name of the game. Money holds each student back from receiving the high quality and well-rounded training and education needed to be conscious professional dancers and business people. It also just makes having a reasonable standard of living in an inflated city that much harder. I am inspired by the generosity of Igal Perry, Artistic Director, who does everything he can to organize financial aid for Certificate Program students in many forms and I would like to contribute. On August 3, 2014, a team of artists, otherwise known as the Wolfe pack - Dani-Juliet Atkinson, Shay Bares, Sara Braun, Katarina Lott, Melinda Moeller, Jackie Nowicki, Mikelle Rindflish, Suzie Rzecznik, Lynda Senisi, Mary Kate Sheehan, Daron Wehle, Marlena Wolfe, and special guest choreographers and artists - are coming together to do just that. There will be two shows (3:30p & 7:00p) and all tickets sales for this event will be given in Scholarship money to Certificate Program students.As I seek new endeavors and plan to move to the Netherlands on August 11, I desire to leave a decade in New York with a bang and begin to give back to all those who supported and paved the way for me by passing it forward. Not to mention my 30th birthday is just two days before on August 1! This event is a time for reflection, celebration, and forward-thinking, and all that I ask is that you join the Wolfe pack. With heartfelt gratitude,Marlena_________________________________________________This indiegogo campaign is solely to cover the expenses of preparing, producing, and executing the two shows at Peridance Capezio Center's Salvatore Capezio Theater on August 3, 2014 at 3:30p and 7:30p. Please donate what you can... $1, $20, $50, $100. The cliche exists for a reason because it is true - Anything helps us get closer to our goal of $10,000! join the pack! By donating any amount of money, you become a member of the Wolfe pack. This is our first perk and it's for everyone who contributes to our campaign with $10, $20, $500... it doesn't matter how much! the Wolfe project will recognize your contribution in the event's program by listing your full name. (For all other perks, see the sidebar on the right.)why should you join the pack?Becoming a pack member is necessary to help us put together events like the one we are launching on August 3, 2014 to raise funds for students seeking higher educations in dance. All tickets sales from the event will be donated as scholarship money to Certificate Program students at Peridance Capezio Center.who are the guest choreographers and artists?So far our guest choreographers include:Mike Esperanza, Diego Funes, Tyler Gilstrap, Jana Hicks, and Breton Tyner-Bryan""Like"" our Facebook page now ""the Wolfe project"" and stay tuned for more.

I have been studying dance since the age of 5 and will be commencing a MA Dance Movement Psychotherapy in September.

<h3><strong>ABOUT DANCE MOVEMENT THERAPY</strong></h3>
<p>Dance Movement Therapy is the youngest of the arts therapies and can be used to treat a whole array of issues, emotional, psychosomatic, traumatic, actute or chronic illness. Arts therapies are also the only form of therapy to be effective in the treatment of schizophrenia. Dance therapy does not require the participant to have any dance training and can be used by anyone of any age.  Many people are currently referred for 'talking therapies' such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy or counselling via their GP, however these types of therapies do not suit everyone as they may not feel comfortable vocalising something which may be traumatic or difficult to express.  Using the arts therapies you are able to go through 'experiential' exercises whereby ou can explore a certain emotion or event without having to describe it in depth.  This can be a much easier process for many people and something that I feel should be more prevelant within a GPs referal. Dance Therapy can also be used as a one-to-one therapy or as group therapy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Arts Therapies are available on the NHS but mainly focus on Art Therapy which is already more progressed than dance movement therapy.  </p>
<h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
<p>Now a bit about myself. I began dancing aged 5 and continued dance classes through to college when I then studied performing arts, theatre and art and design before moving onto University to complete a BA (hons) Dance Studies with drama, theatre and performance studies. My original intention was to become a professional dancer but I have since discovered that it is not the performing per se that I enjoy but more the experience dance gives me, the ability to get lost in the movement and to use dance as a form of self expression. It is this feeling and experience that I now wish to share with others and to bring dance and movement into their lives to enhance their understanding of themselves and to facilitate healing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Over the past few years I have assisted on a number of dance workshops including with young people, those with autism and other learning difficulties, teaching primary school children as well as dance students. My experiences have allowed me to see how dance can touch the lives of people from all backgrounds and of all ages.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I am particulary interested in the differences between dance and dance therapy in the US compared to the UK and this is an area I would like to explore more as part of my studies. My intention throughout my studies and on completion is to be able to being Dance Therapy to all those who need it. Often those most in need of support are those that cannot easily afford the treatment they require. This is something I would dearly like to tackle, to be able to make Dance Therapy easily accessible to all those that need it and to bring more awareness of this type of therapy as 'talking' therapies are not suited to all people and perhaps more people would seek support if they knew this type of therapy was available.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3> HOW YOU CAN HELP</h3>
<p>In order to make this come true though I need to complete a 3 year Masters for which I need to raise funds to pay the tuition fees. I am completing the course part time to allow me to work at the same time to help fund my studies but unfortunately I am unable to reach the fees that are required which is why I ask for the support of the wonderful generous people on indiegogo.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With your help I will be able to help those people who are perhaps in a dark place and need some guidance, so I ask you not to think of funding the course but funding the outcome and the effect this can have on others lives.  One day I would love to set up an Arts Centre that houses all forms of arts and therapies and can also welcome those that would otherwise not be able to afford it and this is the first step towards that.</p>

<p>Zee Zee Theatre invites you to help us proudly present the return of the Jessie award-nominated play </p>
<p>MY FUNNY VALENTINE by Dave Deveau</p>
Directed by Cameron Mackenzie<br/><p>Starring Anton Lipovetsky (2012 Sam Payne Award for Most Promising Newcomer)</p>
<p>February 19-March 2, 2013</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHAT CRITICS ARE SAYING ABOUT THE PRODUCTION:</strong></p>
<p>The play explores the tragic murder of gay, 15-year old Lawrence King and takes the audience along for an artistic, rigorous conversation to find the humanity in the midst of this terrible hate crime.</p>
<p>“My Funny Valentine is a superb piece of theatre. The script is brilliant. This is the first play I’ve see by Dave Deveau, but it certainly won’t be the last.” – Meghan Leigh, HUSH Magazine</p>
<p>“Anton Lipovetsky is a compelling performer who embodies the idiocyncracies and contradictions of each character with energy and compassion… this is a near-perfect performance from one of Vancouver’s most talented young actors.”</p>
<p>""The success of the play relies heavily on a tour de force performance by solo actor Anton Lipovetsky... My Funny Valentine is serious, yet at times humorous, it's disturbing and yet serene. Anton Lipovetsky offers a nuanced performance that won't be easy to forget."" -Review Vancouver</p>
<p> “Lipovetsky’s delivery was so true on opening night that I had to swallow sobs.” – Colin Thomas, Georgia Straight</p>
<p>“The characters in <em>My Funny Valentine</em> were compelling and nuanced. Their distances from the action allowed what could have been a straightforward real-life horror story to unfold like a murder mystery, a whydunit where the answer will never make any sense”        -Mark Leiren-Young, Vancouver Sun</p>
<p>“The play transports the audience through gales of laughter, moments of clarity, fits of rage, and places of aching, compassionate sorrow…. We are left questioning what can possibly be done to stop this from continuing to happen – a heartbreaking and relevant question in recent months.”  - Brian Patterson, Laura Murray PR</p>
<p>“Lipovetsky is a bright-eyed, eager, engaging young actor who embraces each of the characters with a thoughtful sensitivity to their idiosyncrasies. “ -Jo Ledingham, Vancouver Courier</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A death goes far beyond its immediate surroundings: it echoes through a community. On February 11, 2008, in California, 15-year-old Lawrence King asked his classmate Brandon McInerney to be his valentine. The next day, McInerney shot King twice in the head. After being declared brain-dead, King passed away on February 14, 2008–Valentine’s Day.</p>
<p>The critically acclaimed, Jessie-nominated My Funny Valentine examines the fracturing of opinion within a community in the face of this horrendous act and enters the minds of seven people on the fringes of a murder that will forever affect them. The play invites the audience to search through the confusing and chaotic implications of this death to find their own humanity.</p>
<p>""(I am) challenged to become an 11-year-old girl, a middle aged woman, a disgruntled father, (…) with each character presenting a complex and varied viewpoint of a heartbreaking true story. A timely piece and an absolute gift to an actor--I feel tremendously lucky."" - Anton Lipovetsky, actor</p>

<p>Two remarkable plays, one by an established master, the other by a talented new voice. In McPherson's <em>Lime Tree...</em> three young Dublin men recount a fateful weekend in this overlooked gem by the author of <em>The Weir</em> and S<em>hining City</em>. In new playwright Arlin Dixon's Eirlys and Eckhart, a pair of misfits spend the night fighting paranoia and fear as the kitchen walls seem to close in. A powerfully understated first play from a unique new writer.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>ABOUT THE COMPANY</h3>
<p><strong>Where we’ve been</strong></p>
<p><br/>Cart/Horse Theatre has been producing intimate and independent shows since 2006. We have played in Toronto as well as taking some of our shows on the road to Nova Scotia. We`ve been nominated for some awards and we`ve won some others. We have pushed ourselves to grow bigger and better with each show, learning from our mistakes and daring to make new ones. We have delivered top quality shows, featuring performers, directors and designers of the highest caliber, that have remained accessible and affordable for the entire theatre going community. We have only just gotten started.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Where we are</strong><br/>The 2012/13 season, which we`ve named Fight or Flight, is our largest and most ambitious to date. With two fully realized productions we are employing more artists and technical staff than ever before. This is the first year we will stage a completely original script by a talented young playwright making her professional debut. This year is a major turning point for us. Make or break time. With so much on the line this year, it comes down to fight or flight.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Where we’re going</strong><br/>Our dream as a theatre company is to have a home. Not just a home for ourselves, one for the community as well. A place where artists and audience can share a space and share an evening and everyone feels included. A building designed with the audience experience on the top of the priority list. How can we make everyone feel like they’ve come home, to their favorite place, to see their favorite stories told. This will take us a long time, we will have to continue moving from space to space until we can find somewhere to settle. This is what we are building towards and I hope you can be a part of it.</p>
<p>Matthew Gorman, Artistic Director</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>WHERE YOU COME IN</h3>
<p>All contributions made through this campaign will go towards the single largest cost of independant producing, performance space. By devoting the funds raised here to the rental fees of our two venues we can ensure that the revenues from the shows goes to the professional actors, directors, designers, writers, technicians, stage managers and administrators that work to bring these shows to the public.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>YOUR IMPACT</strong></h3>
<p><strong><br/></strong>Theatre doesn't happen until the audience steps in the door. Your contributions here help us keep tickets prices low so that more of our community has a chance to come to the theatre. With your help we can continue to offer discounted rush seats to many performances as well as complimentary tickets to various student and community groups.</p>

ABOUT THE COMPANY
Where we’ve been
Cart/Horse Theatre has been producing intimate and independent shows since 2006. We have played in Toronto as well as taking some of our shows on the road to Nova Scotia. We`ve been nominated for some awards and we`ve won some others. We have pushed ourselves to grow bigger and better with each show, learning from our mistakes and daring to make new ones. We have delivered top quality shows, featuring performers, directors and designers of the highest caliber, that have remained accessible and affordable for the entire theatre going community. We have only just gotten started.
Where we areThe 2012/13 season, which we`ve named Fight or Flight, is our largest and most ambitious to date. With two fully realized productions we are employing more artists and technical staff than ever before. This is the first year we will stage a completely original script by a talented young playwright making her professional debut. This year is a major turning point for us. Make or break time. With so much on the line this year, it comes down to fight or flight.
Where we’re goingOur dream as a theatre company is to have a home. Not just a home for ourselves, one for the community as well. A place where artists and audience can share a space and share an evening and everyone feels included. A building designed with the audience experience on the top of the priority list. How can we make everyone feel like they’ve come home, to their favorite place, to see their favorite stories told. This will take us a long time, we will have to continue moving from space to space until we can find somewhere to settle. This is what we are building towards and I hope you can be a part of it.
Matthew Gorman, Artistic Director
 
WHERE YOU COME IN
All contributions made through this campaign will go towards the single largest cost of independant producing, performance space. By devoting the funds raised here to the rental fees of our two venues we can ensure that the revenues from the shows goes to the professional actors, directors, designers, writers, technicians, stage managers and administrators that work to bring these shows to the public.
 
YOUR IMPACT
Theatre doesn't happen until the audience steps in the door. Your contributions here help us keep tickets prices low so that more of our community has a chance to come to the theatre. With your help we can continue to offer discounted rush seats to many performances as well as complimentary tickets to various student and community groups.

<h3>The Invisible City Project</h3>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em>""What begins as undifferentiated space becomes place as we get to know it better and endow it with value. … Furthermore, if we think of space as that </em><em>which allows movement, then place is pause; each pause in movement makes it possible for location to be transformed into place. ... Home is intimate place.</em><em>""</em>   ~Yi Fu Tuan</p>
<p>What if the city<em> you</em> lived in was personified as an artist?  Would you be able to point out unifying characteristics that run through its diverse body of work?  How might this awareness shift <em>your</em> sense of place?  Well, we have a hunch.  Perhaps because one's sense of place is something experienced in the body, we can learn something about a place through the embodied practice of artists who call the place home?  Perhaps the movement artists among us--dance, theater, and other performance practitioners--can unlock your own Invisible City, unearthing and embodying the abundance of hidden gems among us, one city at a time.</p>
<p>In <em>The Invisible City Project</em>, place is central<em>.</em>  If place is home, then the place in question is Hartford, and the vehicle for exploring this place is contemporary dance and performance practice.  The goal of <em>The Invisible City Project</em> is to get to know Hartford better, endowing it with value by pausing long enough to notice it.  Beginning this August, <em>The Invisible City Project</em> will invite performing artists and audiences to engage as ethnographers, together tracing <em>Hartford-ness</em> in through the diverse contemporary performance practice of current and former residents of Hartford, Connecticut.  This yearlong investigation will unfold through a series of performance events, works in progress showings, online engagement, community gatherings and conversations. </p>
<p>Hartford is small. It is home to 125,000 people, but as Connecticut's capital city, Hartford is the area’s nexus point.  On the surface, Hartford has suffered the consequence of white flight and is often stigmatized by media images of urban blight.  At yet, this same Hartford has a compelling history too few claim, and a dynamic cultural life shaped by a significant number of artists operating just beneath the city's surface.  In many ways, it seems parts of the city remains invisible.  The land itself seems to harbor a residue from its past that continues to inform the city's personality and behavior.  The Hog/Park River once flowed through the city center, shaping city life along its path, but was buried in the 1940s to keep devastating floods at bay.  Replaced by a network of roads and highways, the now subterranean river continues to flow beneath the surface, providing an apt metaphor for the city’s seemingly latent vibrancy. </p>
<p>So what might we learn about ourselves by uncovering the impact of Hartford's history, diverse populations, economic disparity, proximity to established cultural centers, and tension between risk aversion and innovation in relationship to the city's cultural expression?  <em>The Invisible City Project</em> sets out to shed light on this Hartford that is often invisible to the naked eye, but inevitably seep into and through the work of its artists. </p>

<h3>Summary of Project:</h3>
<p>Hello, Everyone!  My name is Catherine Tiso, and I am an independent modern dance choreographer based in Chicago, IL.  I moved to Chicago from Tampa, FL in 2011 to pursue my love of dance and choreography.  After about a year in Chicago, I finally decided it was time to tackle one of my big goals of producing a full-length dance concert as a platform to showcase my own work. </p>
<p>So here I am, announcing that <em>Diverge/Connect </em>will premier in Chicago, August 16-18, 2013, at Constellation, the new home for iconic Links Hall!  In the concert, I will be premiering four new works: two ensemble pieces, one duet, and one solo.  Work will also be shown by guest artists Julie Brannen, Bonnie Christine Willis, and Pittsburgh-based company Texture Contemporary Ballet.  In addition to the dancing, audiences will also be treated to live original music from Denver-based singer/songwriter Lindsey Saunders.</p>
<h3>What's Needed To Make This Work:</h3>
<p>Producing a dance concert is never easy, nor is it ever cheap.  Especially working as an independent artist, funding for projects can tend to be difficult to come by.  I am looking to you for your help in making my first concert a smashing success!  Your donations would go towards funding the following concert components:</p>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Links Hall rental fee</li>
<li>Rehearsal space</li>
<li>Technical Director fee</li>
<li>Photographer fee</li>
<li>Costumes</li>
<li>Printed materials, such as concert programs, posters/postcards for marketing purposes, etc.</li>
<li>Music licensing fees</li>
<li>Housing, food, and transportation costs for Texture Contemporary Ballet artists and Lindsey Saunders</li>
<li>Dancer pay!!!</li>
</ul>
<p>With your help I know that I can make my dream of producing this concert a successful reality!  Any donation amount would be a huge help.  (I know that may sound a bit cliché, but it is in fact very true!)</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways To Help:</h3>
<p>If you find you are unable to donate this time around, don’t fret!  You can be a huge help by sharing this campaign link with your own contacts who may be interested in this.  You can also come see the show!  And of course, never discount the power of sending out some positive energy :-)</p>

<h3>A Little More About Catherine...</h3>
<p>Catherine Tiso is a native of Tampa, Florida.  She graduated Suma Cum Laude from the University of South Florida with a BFA in Modern Dance Performance in 2010.  While at USF, she had the privilege of performing in works by Bill T. Jones, Janis Brenner, Jennifer Archibald, Elsa Valbuena, Mariah Maloney, Lynne Wimmer, and Michael Foley.  In 2008 she studied abroad with the USF Dance in Paris Program in Paris and Marseille, France, and in 2009 was part of a USF concert tour that took her to various cities in northern Tunisia.  Among her accomplishments at USF, she received the Bill Hug Scholarship for Excellence in Choreography and the BRAVO Award for Excellence in Performance and Academics.  She was president of the USF Student Dance Production Board for the 2009-2010 season, and was selected by the faculty to present her senior choreography “mon corps n’est pas ton corps” at the American College Dance Festival in Richmond, Virginia.  Following graduation, she attended the Bates Dance Festival in Lewiston, Maine, where she choreographed and presented a new solo work, “Longing in Madness.”</p>
<p>Catherine participated in the National Society of Arts and Letters Choreography Competition in 2011, taking 7<sup>th</sup> Place at the national competition in Birmingham, AL with her solo “Situational Awareness.”  She has been a faculty member at Theatre Arts and Dance Alliance in Lithia, FL, where she taught classes in modern dance, jazz, and hip hop.  She has taught master classes in modern dance and choreography at Tampa’s Blake High School for the Arts and America’s Ballet School, created an original ballet on Blake High School students, and has choreographed contemporary solos for students participating in the Youth America Grand Prix.  In the fall of 2010, she was the rehearsal director for the restaging of Michael Foley’s work <em>si bel giorno</em> at USF. </p>
<p>Catherine moved to Chicago in the fall of 2011.  In 2012 she performed her work “To Find Hope Among Ashes” through The Open Space Project in Chicago, and created “Dualities” on Texture Contemporary Ballet in Pittsburgh, PA for their concert <em>Blur</em>.  She is greatly looking forward to premiering her first full-length concert in Chicago in August 2013 titled <em>Diverge/Connect</em>.</p>

A Little More About Catherine...
Catherine Tiso is a native of Tampa, Florida.  She graduated Suma Cum Laude from the University of South Florida with a BFA in Modern Dance Performance in 2010.  While at USF, she had the privilege of performing in works by Bill T. Jones, Janis Brenner, Jennifer Archibald, Elsa Valbuena, Mariah Maloney, Lynne Wimmer, and Michael Foley.  In 2008 she studied abroad with the USF Dance in Paris Program in Paris and Marseille, France, and in 2009 was part of a USF concert tour that took her to various cities in northern Tunisia.  Among her accomplishments at USF, she received the Bill Hug Scholarship for Excellence in Choreography and the BRAVO Award for Excellence in Performance and Academics.  She was president of the USF Student Dance Production Board for the 2009-2010 season, and was selected by the faculty to present her senior choreography “mon corps n’est pas ton corps” at the American College Dance Festival in Richmond, Virginia.  Following graduation, she attended the Bates Dance Festival in Lewiston, Maine, where she choreographed and presented a new solo work, “Longing in Madness.”
Catherine participated in the National Society of Arts and Letters Choreography Competition in 2011, taking 7th Place at the national competition in Birmingham, AL with her solo “Situational Awareness.”  She has been a faculty member at Theatre Arts and Dance Alliance in Lithia, FL, where she taught classes in modern dance, jazz, and hip hop.  She has taught master classes in modern dance and choreography at Tampa’s Blake High School for the Arts and America’s Ballet School, created an original ballet on Blake High School students, and has choreographed contemporary solos for students participating in the Youth America Grand Prix.  In the fall of 2010, she was the rehearsal director for the restaging of Michael Foley’s work si bel giorno at USF. 
Catherine moved to Chicago in the fall of 2011.  In 2012 she performed her work “To Find Hope Among Ashes” through The Open Space Project in Chicago, and created “Dualities” on Texture Contemporary Ballet in Pittsburgh, PA for their concert Blur.  She is greatly looking forward to premiering her first full-length concert in Chicago in August 2013 titled Diverge/Connect.

</ul><p> </p></div>","Short Summary
We are a student theatre company based in London and our school has never made it up to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival...until now, that is.


Our company is made up of young, dedicated actors, technicians and reviewers who want to showcase their talents on an international platform.


The play that we have chosen to perform is written by a new, up-and-coming playwright called Polly Stenham. If we can perform at the Fringe then this will be the first time that the play, 'That Face', will have been performed outside of London.


Here is a synopsis of the play:
""When Mia is sent home from boarding school having drugged a younger girl during a hazing ritual, her habitually absent father is recalled from his new life in Hong Kong. 
Her manipulative mother and dependent brother are embroiled in mind games, alcohol and prescription drugs leaving no room for Mia’s problems.Martha’s intense dislike for Mia further alienates her from the family and Henry, the much-loved son struggles to find his own space and identity under the influence of their mother. 
Hugh, their emotionally remote father returns only in an attempt to throw money at the problems his family have descended into during his considerable absence. 
Unwanted Mia is torn between family loyalties, Henry realizes that all his efforts to cure Martha of her problems are in vain and Martha realizes the devastating impact her Oedipal relationship has had on her son.""
'That Face' won the TMA Award 2007 for Best New Play. Polly Stenham received both the Charles Wintour Award 2007 and the Critics' Circle Award 2008 for Most Promising Playwright. Best of all, our performance will be an Edinburgh premiere. 

What We Need & What You Get
Break it down for folks in more detail:


We need help to pay the performance rights which amount to £750. We want to perform from the 5th to the 9th of August. 



If you can contribute £20 then we will guarantee you a seat at the show and a meet and greet with the cast and crew after the performance.


If you can contribute £100 then you could become a friend of The Middle Peg Theatre Company.


If you donate £200 you could become a named sponsor of The Middle Peg Theatre Company.



If we don't reach our goal of £750 your money will still contribute towards performance rights- if necessary, we will just perform on fewer nights!

The Impact


Your contributions will help our aspiring cast and crew achieve their aim of performing on an international stage, give us the possibility of being talent-spotted and guarantee us an experience that will help further our careers.


Our teachers (Edinburgh veterans) who are helping us organise our Festival debut will have the pleasure of introducing the next generation into the delights of the Edinburgh Festival- passing on the cultural torch as it were.

My home town is in Hailey, Idaho, but I am currently a freshman dance major at the wonderful Cornish College of the Arts. I have always pushed myself harder with my dancing whenever I am given the opportunity, and this time, I have been blessed with an amazing opportunity. I have been invited for a summer ballet intensive for seven weeks in New York City. I auditioned in Seattle two weeks ago for the Joffrey Ballet Summer Intensive with a very positive feeling in my heart. I knew that if I was accepted to this intensive, it would be an experience of a life time. I have never been to New York myself, and that is the city that is known all over the world for its dancing. My father, Jeff Davis, opened Joffrey's acceptence email on the evening of February 24th, and burst into tears:its hard to make a 6'5"" man cry. My parents have been the most loving and supportive parents a child could ever ask for, and now, I want to be able to tell them ""Thank you"" by raising money for this intensive. I am worried about the cost of this summer program because my parents are already paying a very large sum of money for my education at Cornish, and my younger sister is on the pathway of going to college soon enough. I want to be able to simply help in any way I possibly can. The amount of money I am trying to raise that will cover my tuition and housing is around $5,800. If the goal is not met, I will still use whatever is raised torwards my tuition and housing. I will be doing my part with trying to find a steady job along with babysitting, house sitting, pet watching, and bake sales. I will appreciate any sum for a donation: every little bit helps! Thank you so much for helping my family out, and helping me pursue my dreams of becomming an amazing dancer! Please feel free to spread the word as well! Thank you and much love.</div>","Hey there!

<p><strong>Note:</strong>  Evolving Doors Dance is fiscally sponsored by Fractured Atlas, a non-profit organization that sponsors arts groups an artists across the country!  This means your contribution to our project is tax deductible.  (Non-deductible portions of the donations are listed along with each perk at the right!)</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h2><span><strong>Who We Are....</strong></span></h2>
<p><span>I'm Angie Simmons, Artistic Director of Evolving Doors Dance.  EDD is a professional, contemporary modern dance company that cultivates, collaborates, builds community, educates, and performs while nurturing the art of dance and movement and its place in our world.  The company was founded in 2006 in Boulder, Colorado.  Our dances often strive to spark audience engagement in ways that create questions, uncover fears, investigate relationships, question behaviors and promote self-examination.  Ultimately, Evolving Doors Dance builds connections through dance; uses dance as an expressive medium of artistic, political and social ideas and views; and evokes thought and questions about life, art, love, social behavior, acceptance, interaction, activism, and humanity.  We are an ever-evolving company in an ever-evolving society!</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>About This Project.... </h2>
<p><span>This project, SKIN, explores the concepts and reasons for human touch.  Why do we touch?  How do we use touch to communicate and what ARE we saying when we do?  Why do we long for touch and human contact?  How can touch be so universal and, at the same time, so uniquely intimate?  What happens to the human body at the moment of touch?  What happens when we are the observer of the interaction of touching?  Our SKIN is the largest organ we have.  Doesn’t it deserve a little attention?  This show promises to be filled with movement, image, texture, skin, contact, and touch.  What lies beneath the SKIN may be a whole other matter.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><span><strong>About Our Campaign.....</strong></span></h2>
<p><span>We have been a professional company since our founding in 2006.  With this, we maintain a few priorities that are essential to the growth of our company and of art as a whole!  A few of these priorities are to present high quality dance work in local, professional venues AND to pay our dancers and staff for their work and skill.  Through this campaign we are working to cover costs for our rental space, which totals $5000.  This allows us to rent space in Boulder’s performing arts venue, the Dairy Center, and also to cover a second performance weekend at a theatre in Denver.  We are also working, through this campaign, to raise a portion of the funds  to pay dancer stipends and staff.  The other portion will be raised through grants and ticket sales.  We are constantly striving to pay these amazing artists more of a living wage.  With your contributions, we can do both of these things!  This $6500 goal is no small feat but is a tremendous assist to our company.  Presenting our shows in professional venues and branching into Denver will continue to expand our audiences and help us grow!  Additionally, paying our dancers, artists, and staff at a more fair rate compensates them for all the time they commit to the process of making this work.  </span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<h2><span><strong>Break It Down Now....</strong></span></h2>
<p><span><strong>$3000</strong> -- Our rental costs for tech week and 2 performances in the Dairy Center.  (This includes the space itself, our house staff, and a technical director... all required by the venue.)</span></p>
<p><span><strong>$2000</strong> -- Rent a comparable but slightly smaller space in Denver for additional week of tech and 2 performances.  </span></p>
<p><span><strong>$1000</strong>  -- A start towards stipends for our dancers and staff.  Our dancers will each rehearsal for at least 200 hours over 6 months for this project!  That is a lot of jumping, turning, falling, and sliding!  If you're doing the math, that is 1400 hours, which, if paid only $5/hr is $1000 per dancer!  We generally can't, as an organization, pay our dancers by the hour, but we would love to some day in our future!  This will be a start.  </span></p>
<p><span><strong>$500</strong> -- This amount covers the fees we pay to Fractured Atlas for for being our fiscal sponsor in the endeavor.  In turn, we get great support and business-of-arts perks from them!</span></p>
<p><span>(In the spirit of full discloser, the total project will end up costing around <strong>$20,000</strong>. So, as you can see, this is just a piece of the pie!)</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<h2><span><strong>The Perks....</strong></span></h2>
<p><span>Yup.... there are totally great perks, including dinner and VIP passes to a show, complete with an invitation to our cast party!  There are also a whole mess of other fun perks you can choose!  (Wanna be included in the show?  Wanna shirt?  How about a sneak-peak of rehearsal?)  Be sure to check out all the perks and pick the donation level that is great for you!</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<h2><span><strong>If We Fall Short...</strong></span></h2>
<p><span>If we don't reach our whole goal, we will start skimming off the wish list.  We'll end up paying our dancers less per performance, reducing staff pay, and cutting back on things like costuming or equipment rental.  If necessary, we would omit our second weekend of performances in Denver.  But, we're hoping, after 6 months of building the show, that it doesn't come down to that!</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<h2><span><strong>Our Track Record...</strong></span></h2>
<p><span>We have an excellent track record with producing fully fleshed-out, professional, evening-length productions just like this one!  We've done so every year since 2006, our first year.  We have tremendously committed dancers and staff, and I'm personally very committed to this project.  It's realization means a great deal to me!  You can rest assured that we mean business!  We also have an excellent history of receiving local grants, which rounds out another portion of the funding on our projects.  And finally, our ticket sales follow up the end as the last portion.</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<h2><span><strong>You Want to Help but Just Can't Today...</strong></span></h2>
<p><span>You want to but it's not in the stars right now?  We, as artists, TOTALLY get it!  There ARE other ways you can help us reach this goal.  Make some <strong><em>serious</em></strong> noise about our campaign, our company, our goals, our wish list, etc!  Use the Indiegogo share tools and post about the campaign on your wall and to your friends.  Shoot out an email to people you think can contribute and are arts lovers!  Help us talk it up! We've got 30 days, so there is time to whoop and holla!   And.... if the stars align for you and us, come back to our campaign page and donate before it ends.  </span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span>However you contribute, we are grateful and so happy you visited our campaign page. The arts are important and essential in this world.  Do or see something art-ful daily!  It will enrich and fill your life.</span></p>

The Anger in Ernest and Ernestine 
Written By Robert Morgan, Martha Ross and Leah Cherniak 
Directed By Robert Morgan 
Starring Jennifer De Lucia and Daniel Stolfi 
Set, Lighting and Costume Design By Glenn Davidson 
Sound Composition By George Axon
Play Synopsis
Ernest and Ernestine live in a perfectly ordered world until
cracks appear in the veneer. Repressed anger rears its ugly head and the
coupleâ€™s efforts to maintain order and affection range from comic to tragic.
 
About the Team
Jennifer De Lucia (Artistic Producer-pivotal(arts)
theatre company) and Daniel Stolfi (Executive Producer-Cancer Canâ€™t Dance
Like This) are award winning producers who have
formed  24/7 Collective to celebrate the 25th anniversary
of the Canadian Classic The Anger in Ernest and Ernestine. Both Daniel
and Jennifer are embarking on this production with the keen desire to celebrate
Canadian playwrights.  Teaming up with Robert Morgan (Director and Original Creator), Glenn Davidson (Original Designer) and George Axon
(Original Composer) this celebration will be at its finest.
 
We decided that the venue neednâ€™t be at a grand theatre, but a
venue that is site specific to the plays location â€“ a basement apartment. The
production will have a healthy three week run at The Unit 102 theatre, in
Toronto, this November, and with your support we can make this dream a
reality.

believe the amount of money and work that goes into producing theatre, and how
little people often get paid for the hundreds of hours of time spent; creating,

<p>Blithe Spirit is a fast-paced comedy featuring novelist Charles Condomine and his inexplicable connection to the beyond.

<p><b><i>Flowers in the Wardrobe</i></b> tells the twisted tale of four children
who try to save their family while exploring the wintry landscape of Narnia. After
the death of their father, and faced with crushing debt, their mother moves the
family into her estranged parents’ mysterious mansion. The children are shunned
by their grandmother and imprisoned in the mansion’s attic. While waiting for
their grandfather to die so their mother can inherit his wealth, the children
seek comfort in cookie binges, dirty dancing, and loving each other in all the
wrong ways. A magical wardrobe offers the children a chance for adventure and
escape, thrusting them into a sinister land populated by talking beavers,
fauns, and witches.</p>

<h3>Intro</h3> <p></p>One night during fall 2013, few days after Lou Reed's death, me - Franco Mosconi - and some friends were listening to the valuable demos included in the Velvet Underground's box set of cd's, bought about twenty years ago. The tracks are full lenght, and in the background you can hear the dialogues between the musicians during the reharsals. Our <b>emotions travel fast</b>, while listening  to that voices and sounds, we're taken back in the early sixities, in the famous New York loft and studio of Andy Warhol, the place where the Velvet's were reharsing, <b>The Factory</b>.<p></p> </div><div>Inside this intense artistic and cultural context, the production of a piece of art was a result of collective project, the contribution of different people and ideas. This is the scene where the <b><i>Exploding Plastic Inevitable</i></b> (<i>E.P.I.</i>) was born, the multimedial Andy Warhol's show, with the live music of the Velvet Underground, starring along with Nico, Gerard Malanga and Edie Sedgwick. It was <b>part show, part a live concert</b>, an happening in which the <b>art</b> was performed each night in different ways. The <i>E.P.I. </i>was and <b>underground and avant-garde</b> production, and for this reason, <b>few people have been so lucky to attend</b>. It was staged only in the States, between 1966 and 1967 in a limited number of replicas, and does not exist significative video footage and photographic documentation.<br/>
</div><div>
<p>So, my question was: <b>how can we make again this amazing show</b> and less known piece of art  from one of the master's of the american Pop Art available <b>to enjoy for the contemporary and future audience, before it will be lost forever in the memory? </b></p>
<p><b>The only way is throught the witness</b> of the only living participant, <b><a href=""http://www.gerardmalanga.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gerard Malanga</a></b>.</p>

<div><br/></div>I'll go straight to the point, just to say that incredibly in three months time, I found myself in Hudson, in the State of New York, knocking on no less than Mr. Malanga's home door!
<p>I've got the appointment after many exchanged mails between us, and thanks to the artist's availabilty, therefore after a long and interesting talk we decide together to produce an <i>E.P.I.</i> inspired show called: <b><i>Gerard Malanga's Venus in Furs</i></b>.</p>
<p>Poet, photographer, actor and filmaker, <b>Gerard Malanga is best known for being the assistant and for a certain period the manager of Andy Warhol</b>. He worked closely with the artist during his most creative period, from 1963 to 1970. Malanga was involved in all the phases of the Warhol's creative output,  silkscreen, painting and filmaking, he also founded with his famous friend ""Interview"" magazine. In 1992, ""The New York Times"" refers to him as «The Andy Warhol's most important associate». </p>
<p><b><i>Gerard Malanga's Venus in Furs</i></b> <b>is born from the Gerard's ""in person"" experience in the Factory</b> and in the <i>E.P.I.</i>,  it tells about <b>the parties, tensions of the everyday life, the characters, the celebrities</b>, diving deeply in the atmospheres of the underground  counterculture remembered as the ""Siver Sixties"" that has defined the concept of the american Pop Art.</p>
<p>Why not seeking a producer? <b>In order to respect the original spirit of the Factory, be indipendent!</b> The essential condition for the total freedom or artistic expression.</p>
<p><b>This is an unmissable opportunity</b>. The exceptional witness and collaboration of Gerard Malanga is priceless, and must be used in the best, possible way. <br/></p>

<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>The show is divided into two acts. The <b>first act</b> is an inside ""<b>behind the curtain</b>"" look that reveals throught real happened facts, the conditions that led to the production of the <i>E.P.I.</i>, a glimpse into a reality that became legendary, the recent past of a bunch of artists and intellectuals that have deeply influenced and fascinated generations of people, and that keep even doing so nowadays.<p></p>
<p>In the <b>second act</b>, the show becomes a <b>live concert</b>, with <b>a band playing on stage</b> the Velvet Undergound's music taken from their first famous album, among them, <i>Sunday Morning, All Tomorrow's parties, Heroin, Venus in Furs</i> (""Rolling Stone"" magazine ranked this album n. 13 of the best ever records in the Rock history), all around, <b>multiscreen projections of experimental films, frames, a bombardment of lights and sounds, incursions in the audience, frantic dance performances</b>.</p>
<div><p>The raised funds are needed to produce the show and take it to the debut, so that it can be distributed in Italy and abroad giving the possibility to everyone to be seen, enjoyed and remembered.</p></div>

</div><div> <p></p>
<p></p>
<p>In order to make the best of this project the costs are important, for different reasons, an <b>high level quality product</b> needs artistic and technological investments commisurated to, like:<br/><br/></p>
<li>
<b>Audio and video technologies:</b> Theaters usually provide for a small part of the equipment , everything else that we need must be rented, then, for a complex kind of show like this, and in order to give back the audience the original feeling to enjoy for a contemporary audience, we need the ultimate state of the art technology, as Warhol and the factory's artists did in 1967.</li>
<li>
<b>Scenography:</b> Scenographies must be built by professionals, they must be safe, easy transportable as well as strong and made to last, other than easily adaptable to different situation of size and shape you can find in different theatres and locations. We also need furnitures and props to complete the set, to be found in second hand markets, and restored.</li>
<li>
<b>Salary for the artists:</b> Actors, musicians, scenographist, costumist, light designer, stage assisitants, the director, all the people that work for the production, inside and outside the set, must be paid weekly, a salary commisurated to the hours of work, the experience and skills.</li>
<li>
<b>Reharsals:</b> We've planned 20 days of reharsals.The locations, the equipments, even if in a reduced form, must be rented and paid for, the actors and all the other people involved must reharse the script (before studying at home!) and have to be paid and reimboursed for food and travel.</li>
<li>
<b>Costumes:</b> We have planned 24 changes of costumes, we'll do our best to find them in flea markets, but of course they have to be paid, and often repaired and adapted by size.</li>
<li>
<b>Promotion:</b> Posters (and the people that sticks them), flyers (and the guys that distributes them), the press agency, who works on the social networks, the website and the Indiegogo pages  to constantly update them for your pleasure.</li>
<li>
<b>Rights to use of original footage and images:</b> The intellectual property is essential, in Italy we say ""diamo a Cesare cio che è di Cesare"" which more or less means, who made it deserve to be respected (and we add, paid for. Seems that no less than Jesus said that).</li>
<li>
<b>Insurances and safety in working environments:</b> Safety first.The workplace must be safe, any worker on the set must be kept away from any risk of accident.</li>
<p></p>

</div>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
<p><b>The show uses different languages from the theatre, music, cinema and art</b>, with all the problems that involves their same time management. A challenge that we decide to take creating <b>a group of work composed by professionals coming from different artistic fields</b>, so that the the skills of one can be integrated with the ones of others.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Gerard Malanga knows well all the issues, and problems related to the staging of this show, as he did it in person long before us, thanks to his direct involvement in the <i>E.P.I.</i>!<br/><br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Why a Flexible Funding Campaign?</h3> <p></p>
</div><p>We’re confident and passionate about this project. If we cant’ reach the goal with a  Fixed campaign (all or nothing), we can’t even begin the production. With a Flexible campaign (take it all), <b>a partial funding would enable us to start with the first steps of the production</b>.</p><p>A further Fixed campaign to complete the production of <i>Gerard Malanga’s Venus in Furs</i> could then be  launched, supported by the work we’ve already done,  that we’ll show you in details.</p><p>If we simply did well the first part of our job, we hope to be rewarded by other contributions!<br/><br/></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;""></span></p><h3>The Perks<br/>

<p></p>
<h3>Introduzione</h3>Una sera dell’autunno 2013, a pochi giorni dalla scomparsa di Lou Reed, io - Franco Mosconi - e alcuni amici riascoltiamo le preziose demo contenute nei cd del box set dei Velvet Underground acquistato quasi vent’anni fa. Le tracce sono integrali e riportano anche i dialoghi tra i musicisti durante le prove. Quelle voci e quei suoni ci trasportano emozionalmente indietro, nei primi anni '60, nel celebre studio / loft newyorchese di Andy Warhol dove i Velvet provavano: <b>The Factory</b>.<p></p>
<p>All'interno di un contesto di intenso fermento artistico e culturale, in cui l’opera d’arte era anche frutto di un progetto collettivo, nasceva <b><i>The Exploding Plastic Inevitable</i></b> (<i>E.P.I.</i>), lo spettacolo multimediale di Warhol con le musiche dei Velvet Underground di Lou Reed, protagonisti insieme a Nico, Gerard Malanga ed Edie Sedgwick. Era <b>uno show, un live e un happening</b> in cui l’arte nasceva sul palco ogni sera in modo diverso. Proprio perché si trattava di una produzione unica e  avant-garde, <b>poche persone hanno avuto l’opportunità di assistervi</b>. Andò difatti in scena solo negli Stati Uniti tra il 1966 ed il 1967, in pochissime repliche. Inoltre non esistono documentazioni fotografiche e video significative. </p>
<div>
<p></p>
<p><b>Come fare riscoprire al pubblico contemporaneo</b>, prima che se ne perda definitivamente la memoria, <b>questa parte poco conosciuta della produzione artistica di uno dei più importanti rappresentanti della Pop Art?</b></p>
<p><b>L’unico modo possibile è attraverso la testimonianza</b> del solo protagonista ancora vivente, ovvero, <b><a href=""http://www.gerardmalanga.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Gerard Malanga</a></b>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1020163/files/20141116134533-AW_GM___camera001.jpg?1416174333"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Vi tralascio tutti i dettagli, limitandomi a dirvi che, incredibilmente, nel giro di tre mesi mi ritrovo a Hudson, nello stato di New York, a bussare alla porta di casa di Mr. Malanga!
<p>L’incontro, frutto di una fitta corrispondenza e della disponibilità dell’artista, porta alla decisione comune di realizzare uno spettacolo ispirato all’E.P.I. che scegliamo insieme di chiamare Gerard Malanga’s Venus in Furs.</p>
<p>Poeta, fotografo, attore e filmmaker, <b>Gerard Malanga è conosciuto al pubblico soprattutto per essere stato assistente e manager di Andy Warhol</b> nel suo periodo di maggiore creatività, dal 1963 al 1970. Malanga è stato coinvolto in tutte le fasi della produzione artistica di Warhol nella Factory: dalle serigrafie - la cui tecnica si deve a lui -, ai dipinti, ai film sperimentali. Insieme a Warhol ha fondato la rivista Interview. Nel 1992, il ""New York Times"" si riferisce a lui come «The Andy Warhol’s most important associate».<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> </span></p>
<p>Dall’esperienza di Malanga nella Factory e nell’<i>E.P.I.</i> nasce quindi <b><i>Gerard Malanga's Venus in Furs</i></b>: una testimonianza vissuta in prima persona, che narra <b>gli avvenimenti, le feste, le tensioni della vita quotidiana, i personaggi e le celebrità</b>, immergendoci nelle atmosfere della controcultura underground dei “Silver Sixties”, che hanno definito il concetto di Pop Art americana.</p>
<p>Perché non mettere il progetto nelle mani di un produttore? <b>Per rispettare lo spirito originario della Factory</b> e dei suoi artisti, lo stesso che ha portato alla creazione dell’<i>E.P.I.</i>: la totale <b>indipendenza produttiva</b>, condizione essenziale per la piena libertà artistica.</p>
<p>Questa è una grande e <b>irripetibile opportunità</b>: l’eccezionale testimonianza di Gerard Malanga è assolutamente preziosa e va messa a frutto nel migliore dei modi.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1020164/files/20141116134601-VU._AW._GM.jpeg?1416174361"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Cosa Vedrete sul Palco</span><br/></p>
<p>Lo spettacolo è strutturato in due atti. <b>Il primo atto</b> è un “<b>dietro le quinte</b>” che svela, attraverso episodi e percorsi realmente accaduti, le condizioni che hanno portato alla realizzazione dell’E.P.I., uno spaccato su una realtà divenuta leggendaria, il passato recente di un gruppo di artisti ed intellettuali, che hanno culturalmente influenzato ed affascinato generazioni, e che continuano a farlo ai giorni nostri.</p>
<p><b>Nel secondo atto</b>, lo spettacolo si trasforma in un <b>concerto live</b>, con una band che interpreta sul palco le musiche dei Velvet Underground estratte dal loro primo celebre album, tra le quali <i>Sunday Morning, All Tomorrow Parties, Heroin, Venus in Furs</i>, (classificato da ""Rolling Stone"" al n. 13 dei migliori album di sempre nella storia del rock). Intorno, un collage di <b>proiezioni di film sperimentali, diapositive, bombardamenti di luci, suoni, incursioni tra il pubblico e frenetiche performance di danza</b> accompagnate da citazioni, racconti e aneddoti videonarrati dallo stesso Malanga.</p>
<p>I fondi servono per produrre lo spettacolo e portarlo al debutto affinché abbia l’opportunità di essere distribuito in Italia e all’estero e poter essere visto da tutti.</p>

<h3>Di Cosa Abbiamo Bisogno e Perché<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px; background-color: initial;""> </span>
</h3>
<div>
<p>Per realizzare al meglio <i>Gerard Malanga’s Venus in Furs</i> i costi da sostenere sono consistenti, per diversi motivi. <b>Un prodotto di qualità</b> richiede investimenti in termini tecnici e artistici: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Tecnologie audio video:</b> I teatri forniscono solo una piccola parte delle attrezzature che necessitano per la realizzazione dello spettacolo, tutto quello che manca lo dobbiamo noleggiare. Inoltre, per uno spettacolo così complesso e per ricreare lo stesso impatto dello show originale ma per il pubblico contemporaneo, sono necessarie tecnologie all’avanguardia. Proprio come fecero Warhol e i gli artisti della Factory nel ’67.</li>
<li>
<b>Scenografie:</b> Le scenografie vanno costruite in un laboratorio esterno da professionisti, in quanto devono essere realizzate in modo che siano facilmente smontabili e trasportabili, e allo stesso tempo solide e che possano durare a lungo, oltre che adattabili  alle diverse situazioni di spazio e dimensioni che si incontrano nei vari teatri e location, bisogna poi arredare il set con gli oggetti di scena, da recuperare nei mercatini, restaurare e portarli a nuova vita.</li>
<li>
<b>Pagare gli artisti:</b> Attori, musicisti,tecnici, macchinisti, regista, scenografo, costumista, light designer, tutte le figure che lavorano alla produzione, sul set e fuori dal set devono percepire un compenso settimanale adeguato all'impegno, alle capacità e all'esperienza.</li>
<li>
<b>Prove:</b> Abbiamo pianificato 20 giorni di prove, gli spazi vanno affittati, le attrezzature tecniche, anche se in forma ridotta, vanno noleggiate, gli attori e le altre figure che lavorano allo spettacolo  devono necessariamente provare il copione, e devono essere pagate e rimborsate per diaria e spostamenti.</li>
<li>
<b>Costumi:</b> I cambi di costume sono 24, ci daremo da fare a scovarli nei mercatini delle pulci, ma vanno comunque pagati, a volte aggiustati e spesso messi a misura.</li>
<li>
<b>Promozione:</b> Locandine, manifesti (e chi li attacca), flyers (e chi li distribuisce), l'ufficio stampa, chi segue e aggiorna i social il sito e la pagina Indiegogo.</li>
<li>
<b>Diritti per l’utilizzo di filmati e immagini d’epoca:</b> I diritti d' autore e la proprietà intellettuale sono imprescindibili, diamo a Cesare ciò che è di Cesare!</li>
<li>
<b>Polizze assicurative &amp; sicurezza degli ambienti di lavoro:</b> La sicurezza prima di tutto. L'ambiente di lavoro deve essere in sicurezza, chi lavora sul set deve essere messo al riparo dal rischio di infortuni.</li>
</ul>
<div>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/998677/files/20141109070340-torta.png?1415545420"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""/><br/></p>
<b>Il vostro contributo è fondamentale, anche il più piccolo.</b> Se non riusciamo a raggiungere l’obiettivo, lo spettacolo non potrà mai essere prodotto e questa opportunità sarà perduta definitivamente.<br/><br/>
</div>
<h3>Rischi e Sfide</h3>
<p><b></b></p>Lo spettacolo usa <b>linguaggi differenti, quelli del teatro, della musica, del cinema e dell’arte</b>, con tutte le problematiche che comporta la loro gestione contemporanea. Una sfida che abbiamo scelto di affrontare creando <b>un gruppo di lavoro formato da professionisti provenienti da diverse esperienze nei vari campi artistici</b>, affinché le competenze di ognuno siano integrate con quelle degli altri.<br/><p><br/>Inoltre, Gerard Malanga ha affrontato tutte le problematiche relative alla messa in scena di questo tipo di spettacolo ben prima di noi, grazie al suo coinvolgimento diretto nell’<i>E.P.I.</i></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Perché una Campagna di Raccolta ""Flexible""?</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Siamo ottimisti e molto motivati nei confronti di questo progetto. Se non riuscissimo a raggiungere l'obiettivo prestabilito con una campagna ""Fixed"" (tutto o niente) , non potremmo neppure incominciare la produzione. Con una campagna di tipo ""Flexible"" (si ottengono tutti fondi raccolti) <b>anche un finanziamento parziale ci permetterebbe di partire con le prime fasi della produzione</b>.</p>
<p>Una successiva campagna ""Fixed"" al fine di completare la produzione di ""Gerard Malanga's Venus in Furs"" potrebbe poi essere lanciata, con il supporto del lavoro già fatto, e che vi faremo vedere nei dettagli. Semplicemente, se abbiamo eseguito bene la nostra prima parte del lavoro, ci auguriamo di essere ricompensati con ulteriori contributi!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>I ""Perk""</h3>

Dopo che avremo ricevuto la vostra donazione, vi contatteremo via email per la misura e il soggetto desiderato.<br/>

Intro One night during fall 2013, few days after Lou Reed's death, me - Franco Mosconi - and some friends were listening to the valuable demos included in the Velvet Underground's box set of cd's, bought about twenty years ago. The tracks are full lenght, and in the background you can hear the dialogues between the musicians during the reharsals. Our emotions travel fast, while listening  to that voices and sounds, we're taken back in the early sixities, in the famous New York loft and studio of Andy Warhol, the place where the Velvet's were reharsing, The Factory. Inside this intense artistic and cultural context, the production of a piece of art was a result of collective project, the contribution of different people and ideas. This is the scene where the Exploding Plastic Inevitable (E.P.I.) was born, the multimedial Andy Warhol's show, with the live music of the Velvet Underground, starring along with Nico, Gerard Malanga and Edie Sedgwick. It was part show, part a live concert, an happening in which the art was performed each night in different ways. The E.P.I. was and underground and avant-garde production, and for this reason, few people have been so lucky to attend. It was staged only in the States, between 1966 and 1967 in a limited number of replicas, and does not exist significative video footage and photographic documentation.

So, my question was: how can we make again this amazing show and less known piece of art  from one of the master's of the american Pop Art available to enjoy for the contemporary and future audience, before it will be lost forever in the memory? 
The only way is throught the witness of the only living participant, Gerard Malanga.

I'll go straight to the point, just to say that incredibly in three months time, I found myself in Hudson, in the State of New York, knocking on no less than Mr. Malanga's home door!
I've got the appointment after many exchanged mails between us, and thanks to the artist's availabilty, therefore after a long and interesting talk we decide together to produce an E.P.I. inspired show called: Gerard Malanga's Venus in Furs.
Poet, photographer, actor and filmaker, Gerard Malanga is best known for being the assistant and for a certain period the manager of Andy Warhol. He worked closely with the artist during his most creative period, from 1963 to 1970. Malanga was involved in all the phases of the Warhol's creative output,  silkscreen, painting and filmaking, he also founded with his famous friend ""Interview"" magazine. In 1992, ""The New York Times"" refers to him as «The Andy Warhol's most important associate». 
Gerard Malanga's Venus in Furs is born from the Gerard's ""in person"" experience in the Factory and in the E.P.I.,  it tells about the parties, tensions of the everyday life, the characters, the celebrities, diving deeply in the atmospheres of the underground  counterculture remembered as the ""Siver Sixties"" that has defined the concept of the american Pop Art.
Why not seeking a producer? In order to respect the original spirit of the Factory, be indipendent! The essential condition for the total freedom or artistic expression.
This is an unmissable opportunity. The exceptional witness and collaboration of Gerard Malanga is priceless, and must be used in the best, possible way. 





The ImpactThe show is divided into two acts. The first act is an inside ""behind the curtain"" look that reveals throught real happened facts, the conditions that led to the production of the E.P.I., a glimpse into a reality that became legendary, the recent past of a bunch of artists and intellectuals that have deeply influenced and fascinated generations of people, and that keep even doing so nowadays.
In the second act, the show becomes a live concert, with a band playing on stage the Velvet Undergound's music taken from their first famous album, among them, Sunday Morning, All Tomorrow's parties, Heroin, Venus in Furs (""Rolling Stone"" magazine ranked this album n. 13 of the best ever records in the Rock history), all around, multiscreen projections of experimental films, frames, a bombardment of lights and sounds, incursions in the audience, frantic dance performances.
The raised funds are needed to produce the show and take it to the debut, so that it can be distributed in Italy and abroad giving the possibility to everyone to be seen, enjoyed and remembered.


What We Need & What You Get
 

In order to make the best of this project the costs are important, for different reasons, an high level quality product needs artistic and technological investments commisurated to, like:

Audio and video technologies: Theaters usually provide for a small part of the equipment , everything else that we need must be rented, then, for a complex kind of show like this, and in order to give back the audience the original feeling to enjoy for a contemporary audience, we need the ultimate state of the art technology, as Warhol and the factory's artists did in 1967.

Scenography: Scenographies must be built by professionals, they must be safe, easy transportable as well as strong and made to last, other than easily adaptable to different situation of size and shape you can find in different theatres and locations. We also need furnitures and props to complete the set, to be found in second hand markets, and restored.

Salary for the artists: Actors, musicians, scenographist, costumist, light designer, stage assisitants, the director, all the people that work for the production, inside and outside the set, must be paid weekly, a salary commisurated to the hours of work, the experience and skills.

Reharsals: We've planned 20 days of reharsals.The locations, the equipments, even if in a reduced form, must be rented and paid for, the actors and all the other people involved must reharse the script (before studying at home!) and have to be paid and reimboursed for food and travel.

Costumes: We have planned 24 changes of costumes, we'll do our best to find them in flea markets, but of course they have to be paid, and often repaired and adapted by size.

Promotion: Posters (and the people that sticks them), flyers (and the guys that distributes them), the press agency, who works on the social networks, the website and the Indiegogo pages  to constantly update them for your pleasure.

Rights to use of original footage and images: The intellectual property is essential, in Italy we say ""diamo a Cesare cio che è di Cesare"" which more or less means, who made it deserve to be respected (and we add, paid for. Seems that no less than Jesus said that).

Insurances and safety in working environments: Safety first.The workplace must be safe, any worker on the set must be kept away from any risk of accident.




Your contribute is essential, even the smallest. If we cant' reach the goal, this show will never see the lights, and this opportunity will be lost forever. You know what you can.


Risks & Challenges  
The show uses different languages from the theatre, music, cinema and art, with all the problems that involves their same time management. A challenge that we decide to take creating a group of work composed by professionals coming from different artistic fields, so that the the skills of one can be integrated with the ones of others.
Furthermore, Gerard Malanga knows well all the issues, and problems related to the staging of this show, as he did it in person long before us, thanks to his direct involvement in the E.P.I.!
  Why a Flexible Funding Campaign? 
We’re confident and passionate about this project. If we cant’ reach the goal with a  Fixed campaign (all or nothing), we can’t even begin the production. With a Flexible campaign (take it all), a partial funding would enable us to start with the first steps of the production.A further Fixed campaign to complete the production of Gerard Malanga’s Venus in Furs could then be  launched, supported by the work we’ve already done,  that we’ll show you in details.If we simply did well the first part of our job, we hope to be rewarded by other contributions!The Perks


After you'll have placed your donation, we will contact you by email for your size and chosen design.Please, don't forget to add the ""Costi spedizione per l'Italia"" perk for shipping in Italy ($11), or the ""Shipping costs outside Italy"" perk ($24). Pop Art is (nearly) for EveryoneIf you can't  wait until it will be staged in your local theatre, the Premiere of Gerard Malanga’s Venus in Furs will be filmed and we’ll send to all contributors a private link to watch the video of the whole show.
Other Means to Support Us... in the Spirit of the Factory!
The Factory, as an artistic independent ""experimental lab"" could count on multiple talents that were involved, contributing in different ways to many projects, in the same way you all, could give an hand to achieve the production of this amazing show, even simply spreading the word. Please share on your favorite socials our website, this Indiegogo page, our Facebook and Twitter profile, where you can find pictures, curiosity about the extraordinary people at the Factory.Thanks for your support, you know what you can, each contribute is essential, even the smallest one! With your help we can switch on the lights!

P.S.
We did our best, even thought, English is not our mother tongue, so forgive us for any mistake, hoping we succeded to show how excited we are about this project!

ITALIANO
Gerard Malanga’s Venus in Furs

Rivivi gli avvenimenti che negli anni '60 hanno sconvolto il mondo dell'arte!Sostieni la realizzazione dello spettacolo ispirato agli artisti della Factory di Andy Warhol! 




IntroduzioneUna sera dell’autunno 2013, a pochi giorni dalla scomparsa di Lou Reed, io - Franco Mosconi - e alcuni amici riascoltiamo le preziose demo contenute nei cd del box set dei Velvet Underground acquistato quasi vent’anni fa. Le tracce sono integrali e riportano anche i dialoghi tra i musicisti durante le prove. Quelle voci e quei suoni ci trasportano emozionalmente indietro, nei primi anni '60, nel celebre studio / loft newyorchese di Andy Warhol dove i Velvet provavano: The Factory.
All'interno di un contesto di intenso fermento artistico e culturale, in cui l’opera d’arte era anche frutto di un progetto collettivo, nasceva The Exploding Plastic Inevitable (E.P.I.), lo spettacolo multimediale di Warhol con le musiche dei Velvet Underground di Lou Reed, protagonisti insieme a Nico, Gerard Malanga ed Edie Sedgwick. Era uno show, un live e un happening in cui l’arte nasceva sul palco ogni sera in modo diverso. Proprio perché si trattava di una produzione unica e  avant-garde, poche persone hanno avuto l’opportunità di assistervi. Andò difatti in scena solo negli Stati Uniti tra il 1966 ed il 1967, in pochissime repliche. Inoltre non esistono documentazioni fotografiche e video significative. 


Come fare riscoprire al pubblico contemporaneo, prima che se ne perda definitivamente la memoria, questa parte poco conosciuta della produzione artistica di uno dei più importanti rappresentanti della Pop Art?
L’unico modo possibile è attraverso la testimonianza del solo protagonista ancora vivente, ovvero, Gerard Malanga. 

Vi tralascio tutti i dettagli, limitandomi a dirvi che, incredibilmente, nel giro di tre mesi mi ritrovo a Hudson, nello stato di New York, a bussare alla porta di casa di Mr. Malanga!
L’incontro, frutto di una fitta corrispondenza e della disponibilità dell’artista, porta alla decisione comune di realizzare uno spettacolo ispirato all’E.P.I. che scegliamo insieme di chiamare Gerard Malanga’s Venus in Furs.
Poeta, fotografo, attore e filmmaker, Gerard Malanga è conosciuto al pubblico soprattutto per essere stato assistente e manager di Andy Warhol nel suo periodo di maggiore creatività, dal 1963 al 1970. Malanga è stato coinvolto in tutte le fasi della produzione artistica di Warhol nella Factory: dalle serigrafie - la cui tecnica si deve a lui -, ai dipinti, ai film sperimentali. Insieme a Warhol ha fondato la rivista Interview. Nel 1992, il ""New York Times"" si riferisce a lui come «The Andy Warhol’s most important associate». 
Dall’esperienza di Malanga nella Factory e nell’E.P.I. nasce quindi Gerard Malanga's Venus in Furs: una testimonianza vissuta in prima persona, che narra gli avvenimenti, le feste, le tensioni della vita quotidiana, i personaggi e le celebrità, immergendoci nelle atmosfere della controcultura underground dei “Silver Sixties”, che hanno definito il concetto di Pop Art americana.
Perché non mettere il progetto nelle mani di un produttore? Per rispettare lo spirito originario della Factory e dei suoi artisti, lo stesso che ha portato alla creazione dell’E.P.I.: la totale indipendenza produttiva, condizione essenziale per la piena libertà artistica.
Questa è una grande e irripetibile opportunità: l’eccezionale testimonianza di Gerard Malanga è assolutamente preziosa e va messa a frutto nel migliore dei modi.


Cosa Vedrete sul Palco
Lo spettacolo è strutturato in due atti. Il primo atto è un “dietro le quinte” che svela, attraverso episodi e percorsi realmente accaduti, le condizioni che hanno portato alla realizzazione dell’E.P.I., uno spaccato su una realtà divenuta leggendaria, il passato recente di un gruppo di artisti ed intellettuali, che hanno culturalmente influenzato ed affascinato generazioni, e che continuano a farlo ai giorni nostri.
Nel secondo atto, lo spettacolo si trasforma in un concerto live, con una band che interpreta sul palco le musiche dei Velvet Underground estratte dal loro primo celebre album, tra le quali Sunday Morning, All Tomorrow Parties, Heroin, Venus in Furs, (classificato da ""Rolling Stone"" al n. 13 dei migliori album di sempre nella storia del rock). Intorno, un collage di proiezioni di film sperimentali, diapositive, bombardamenti di luci, suoni, incursioni tra il pubblico e frenetiche performance di danza accompagnate da citazioni, racconti e aneddoti videonarrati dallo stesso Malanga.
I fondi servono per produrre lo spettacolo e portarlo al debutto affinché abbia l’opportunità di essere distribuito in Italia e all’estero e poter essere visto da tutti.


Di Cosa Abbiamo Bisogno e Perché 


Per realizzare al meglio Gerard Malanga’s Venus in Furs i costi da sostenere sono consistenti, per diversi motivi. Un prodotto di qualità richiede investimenti in termini tecnici e artistici: 


Tecnologie audio video: I teatri forniscono solo una piccola parte delle attrezzature che necessitano per la realizzazione dello spettacolo, tutto quello che manca lo dobbiamo noleggiare. Inoltre, per uno spettacolo così complesso e per ricreare lo stesso impatto dello show originale ma per il pubblico contemporaneo, sono necessarie tecnologie all’avanguardia. Proprio come fecero Warhol e i gli artisti della Factory nel ’67.

Scenografie: Le scenografie vanno costruite in un laboratorio esterno da professionisti, in quanto devono essere realizzate in modo che siano facilmente smontabili e trasportabili, e allo stesso tempo solide e che possano durare a lungo, oltre che adattabili  alle diverse situazioni di spazio e dimensioni che si incontrano nei vari teatri e location, bisogna poi arredare il set con gli oggetti di scena, da recuperare nei mercatini, restaurare e portarli a nuova vita.

Pagare gli artisti: Attori, musicisti,tecnici, macchinisti, regista, scenografo, costumista, light designer, tutte le figure che lavorano alla produzione, sul set e fuori dal set devono percepire un compenso settimanale adeguato all'impegno, alle capacità e all'esperienza.

Prove: Abbiamo pianificato 20 giorni di prove, gli spazi vanno affittati, le attrezzature tecniche, anche se in forma ridotta, vanno noleggiate, gli attori e le altre figure che lavorano allo spettacolo  devono necessariamente provare il copione, e devono essere pagate e rimborsate per diaria e spostamenti.

Costumi: I cambi di costume sono 24, ci daremo da fare a scovarli nei mercatini delle pulci, ma vanno comunque pagati, a volte aggiustati e spesso messi a misura.

Promozione: Locandine, manifesti (e chi li attacca), flyers (e chi li distribuisce), l'ufficio stampa, chi segue e aggiorna i social il sito e la pagina Indiegogo.

Diritti per l’utilizzo di filmati e immagini d’epoca: I diritti d' autore e la proprietà intellettuale sono imprescindibili, diamo a Cesare ciò che è di Cesare!

Polizze assicurative & sicurezza degli ambienti di lavoro: La sicurezza prima di tutto. L'ambiente di lavoro deve essere in sicurezza, chi lavora sul set deve essere messo al riparo dal rischio di infortuni.




Il vostro contributo è fondamentale, anche il più piccolo. Se non riusciamo a raggiungere l’obiettivo, lo spettacolo non potrà mai essere prodotto e questa opportunità sarà perduta definitivamente.

Rischi e Sfide
Lo spettacolo usa linguaggi differenti, quelli del teatro, della musica, del cinema e dell’arte, con tutte le problematiche che comporta la loro gestione contemporanea. Una sfida che abbiamo scelto di affrontare creando un gruppo di lavoro formato da professionisti provenienti da diverse esperienze nei vari campi artistici, affinché le competenze di ognuno siano integrate con quelle degli altri.Inoltre, Gerard Malanga ha affrontato tutte le problematiche relative alla messa in scena di questo tipo di spettacolo ben prima di noi, grazie al suo coinvolgimento diretto nell’E.P.I.

Perché una Campagna di Raccolta ""Flexible""?


Siamo ottimisti e molto motivati nei confronti di questo progetto. Se non riuscissimo a raggiungere l'obiettivo prestabilito con una campagna ""Fixed"" (tutto o niente) , non potremmo neppure incominciare la produzione. Con una campagna di tipo ""Flexible"" (si ottengono tutti fondi raccolti) anche un finanziamento parziale ci permetterebbe di partire con le prime fasi della produzione.
Una successiva campagna ""Fixed"" al fine di completare la produzione di ""Gerard Malanga's Venus in Furs"" potrebbe poi essere lanciata, con il supporto del lavoro già fatto, e che vi faremo vedere nei dettagli. Semplicemente, se abbiamo eseguito bene la nostra prima parte del lavoro, ci auguriamo di essere ricompensati con ulteriori contributi!


I ""Perk""


Dopo che avremo ricevuto la vostra donazione, vi contatteremo via email per la misura e il soggetto desiderato.

Ti preghiamo di aggiungere anche il perk ""Costi spedizione per l'Italia"" ($11), o il ""Shipping costs outside Italy"" perk ($24).


La Pop Art è (quasi) per Tutti

Se proprio non riuscite ad aspettare che arrivi nel teatro della vostra città, il debutto di Gerard Malanga’s Venus in Furs verrà ripreso, e tutti i contributori riceveranno un link privato dove potranno guardare il video dell’intero spettacolo.

<p>Here's the concept
everyone is responding to: </p>
<p>Picture yourself standing
outside the doors of the most infamous discotheque of all time, Studio 54. The
velvet rope teases your legs as a gorgeous young bouncer points to you, beckoning
you into a place only a select few are lucky enough to explore. You brush past
the unlucky ones and enter into a world of glamour and excess. The disco beat
vibrates through your body like a tribal rhythm as you approach the dance floor
where the club’s chanteuse, COCO DE GRAND PRIX, sits on a giant crescent moon
suspended from the ceiling delivering her signature song of the evening,
MACARTHUR PARK. You are escorted to a seat in the shadows where you can choose
to either become part of the action or just get high off the sights and sounds
surrounding you. Suddenly the room explodes as couples erupt into a brisk
choreographed hustle on the dance floor and we are introduced to our leading
lady, ROBYN CONNORS - a privileged divorcée and one-hit disco wonder, whose
dream is to return to the spotlight and headline the hottest club of all time,
Studio 54. When she bumps into CLIFF KNIGHT - front man for the funk band THE
BLACK KNIGHTS, she finds herself falling in love with someone who is not only
on the other side of the music scene but also the racial divide. When CLIFF’s
frustrated ex-girlfriend TONYA learns of their affair, she arranges for ROBYN’s
segregationist brother BRIAN to play in the band – one of several attempts to
see that CLIFF and ROBYN never lay hands on each other again.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“54”
– the musical is an updated version of a jukebox musical, combining the
touching feel of a Memphis-type story, the exciting narrative of a Rock of
Ages- type disco score, the immersive experience of Fuerza Bruta and the sheer
fun of The Donkey Show – allowing you to become part of the hypnotic club scene
of the 70s. Utilizing a cast of 5 principal and 9 featured characters on one
moving set, this funny and heartbreaking original story is enhanced by an
incomparable playlist of the era’s greatest songs - reminding you that disco
never sucked and that it’s still ok to have more than a great time. </p>
<p>And
here's how it came to be:</p>
<p>“54”- the
musical was conceived during the summer of 2009 thanks to an excellent iTunes
playlist and a decent car stereo and actually written whilst
alternate-side-of-the-street parking in Manhattan the fall of 2009. It was
registered with the DGA in March 2010, received a copyright in June 2010, was
informally read around a dining table sometime thereafter and subsequently read
in December 2010 at the historic Gramercy Theatre (now concert venue) in NYC. A
more formal (private) reading was enjoyed at the Lark Theatre in NYC in the
Spring of 2012 and after a successful Indie Go-Go Campaign where over $10,000
was raised in just over two months, a staged and choreographed concert
production of “54”- the musical was unveiled at The Cutting Room on November
11th, 2012 to a sold-out crowd. “54”- the musical is currently in development
for Broadway. </p><p><br/></p><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Thanks in advance for your generous contribution and stay tuned for exciting updates along the way!</h2><p><br/></p><p>Love,</p><p><span><br/></span>Team ""54""</p>

</p><p>Boomerang Theatre Company needs your support!</p>
<p>Boomerang Theatre Company has spent the last 16 years
building an unparalleled track record of exceptional work in Indie Theatre. The
body of work speaks for itself: 56 full productions; nearly 60 readings and
workshops of new plays; 8 New York Innovative Theatre Nominations; A Caffe Cino
Fellowship; 17 free productions of Shakespeare plays in parks throughout New
York City, serving nearly twenty five thousand audience members; nearly fifty
thousand overall audience members served; and an uncountable number of artists
given an opportunity to grow, shine, and demonstrate their passionate
understanding of the world.</p>
<p>During the next 8 months, we are embarking on our biggest
projects ever: </p>
<p>-We are expanding our First Flight New Play Festival to
include more opportunity and support for artists.<br/>
-We are producing the New York Premiere of the hit drama WAVING GOODBYE by
acclaimed playwright Jamie Pachino, directed by Jordana Williams<br/>
-And we are remounting our smash hit comedy LICKSPITTLES, BUTTONHOLERS AND
DAMNED PERNICIOUS GO-BETWEENS by Johnna Adams, directed by John Hurley.</p>
<p>Producing these projects is the next defining moment for our
company, setting the tone for the company we are as we approach our 20<sup>th</sup>
anniversary milestone year in 2018. We are striving to be a company keeps our
audience engaged by telling the stories that reverberate with the world we live
in. We are also the company that knows these compelling projects on happen when
artists are nurtured, supported and free.  Now, 56 full productions under our collective belt, the same
ideas still fuel the organization. Boomerang Theatre Company does plays that
have to be done, created by artists living in the moment in history right now,
responding to the world be live in and putting that response onstage to talk
about, scream at, laugh along with, mourn with and celebrate. These plays burn,
pulse, and rage. They are not timid plays. They seek to break ground, to make a
difference to the audience, leaving them a different set of people then they

Boomerang Theatre Company has spent the last 16 years
building an unparalleled track record of exceptional work in Indie Theatre. The
body of work speaks for itself: 56 full productions; nearly 60 readings and
workshops of new plays; 8 New York Innovative Theatre Nominations; A Caffe Cino
Fellowship; 17 free productions of Shakespeare plays in parks throughout New
York City, serving nearly twenty five thousand audience members; nearly fifty
thousand overall audience members served; and an uncountable number of artists
given an opportunity to grow, shine, and demonstrate their passionate
understanding of the world.
During the next 8 months, we are embarking on our biggest
projects ever: 
-We are expanding our First Flight New Play Festival to
include more opportunity and support for artists.
-We are producing the New York Premiere of the hit drama WAVING GOODBYE by
acclaimed playwright Jamie Pachino, directed by Jordana Williams
-And we are remounting our smash hit comedy LICKSPITTLES, BUTTONHOLERS AND
DAMNED PERNICIOUS GO-BETWEENS by Johnna Adams, directed by John Hurley.
Producing these projects is the next defining moment for our
company, setting the tone for the company we are as we approach our 20th
anniversary milestone year in 2018. We are striving to be a company keeps our
audience engaged by telling the stories that reverberate with the world we live
in. We are also the company that knows these compelling projects on happen when
artists are nurtured, supported and free.  Now, 56 full productions under our collective belt, the same
ideas still fuel the organization. Boomerang Theatre Company does plays that
have to be done, created by artists living in the moment in history right now,
responding to the world be live in and putting that response onstage to talk
about, scream at, laugh along with, mourn with and celebrate. These plays burn,
pulse, and rage. They are not timid plays. They seek to break ground, to make a
difference to the audience, leaving them a different set of people then they
were when the lights went down. Whether producing detailed revivals,
rediscovering lost plays that needed a new examination, or premiering a new
play born yesterday, these plays are chosen to communicate the way we live
today, the inherent urgency of a life lived fully on each day.

<p><b>How
Lockhart Came to Be</b></p>
<p>Lockhart,
the musical, is about hope. We can all identify with it.<span>  It celebrates who we ‘really are’ rather than
who other people want us to be. Imagine wanting to let your hair down and join
in with all the authentic personalities on stage? </span></p>
<p>Producer
Leila Witkin has always been fascinated by the human voice and what it tells us
about a person.<span>  The voice is the muscle
of the soul.  She has sought ways to
delve into the psyche for all individuals and to tap into the persuasive power
of successful communication.  This does,
of course, lead to opening up an entirely new world for those who previously
have been unable to portray themselves authentically.  </span></p>
<p>To
that end, Leila wrote a book that explores how one can attain those lofty, but
achievable goals, of self-awareness and ultimately become that authentic
person, especially by being able to speak in public.<span>  Its title is </span><i>UnAfraid, UnFrazzled and
UnFrogettable</i>.<span>  </span></p>
<p>Believe it or not, public speaking is the number one fear for most people.<span> Comedian
Jerry Seinfeld has said that, “most people would rather be in the casket than
making the eulogy.”  We all strive to be
liked and we want to be accepted, regardless of who we are. </span></p>
<p>And,
it sometimes takes real intestinal fortitude to be authentic and not let fear
lead the way.<span>  It all comes down to the
question of mind-set, to no longer live falsely, but to simply be oneself.
Discovery of the true self is a valid revelation of oneself. Lockhart
illustrates this and at the same time deals with forgiveness. </span></p>
<p>Once
the thought of creating a musical that would explore one’s individuality to
find the courage to stand up and stand out, to be different, to find one’s
authentic voice began to resonate, a call was made to Jason, to begin discussions
about creating a musical.<span>  </span></p>
<p>He
suggested that Ashley Robinson be brought on board to create the book.</p>
<p>This
show is a classic American book musical in a Southern-gothic style.<span>  It is based on the premise that is espoused
by Leila Witkin herself, her beliefs and the book that she wrote, that we all
have the right to celebrate our authentic selves.</span></p><p><span><br/></span></p>
<p><b>Lockhart: Story Premise</b></p>
<p>Gilbert
Worthy, 27, is a young man stuck in Lockhart, Georgia, a dying, poor Southern
mill village that no longer has a mill – population 367.<span>  It’s nearly an hour from even a supermarket,
a movie theater, or a Walmart.  He lives
in a tiny house in dire need of repair with his chronically ill mother Melinda.  Trapped with a cheating girlfriend, three
dead-end jobs, Gilbert has an intense longing to get out. </span></p>
<p>One
night, he escapes to his “spot” by the river where he goes to get away and to
think, lying in the bed of his pick-up truck and just looking up at the
stars.<span>  He feels stuck, trapped by the
isolation of his poverty-stricken town with no opportunity.  It’s like quicksand—the more you try to
escape, the deeper you sink.  But, he
feels a pull of greatness.  There’s something
better for him out there, somewhere…</span></p>
<p>As
he gazes up at the stars, he hears some commotion coming from the other bank of
the river.<span>  Then, in the
starlight…colourful lights illuminate! 
THE FAIR is here this week; he forgot! 
The fair hasn’t been to this town since the mill closed 16 years
ago.  Gilbert is excited; it’s as though
a colourful cluster of stars has fallen to the ground.  “A cluster of stars that I can actually
reach, walk right into, a magnetic mystery pulling me into itself.”  </span></p>
<p>Gilbert
has found something extraordinary in the most unlikely place, a light in the
darkness, a mirage.<span>  This is the opening
metaphor for finding one’s greatness where it is least expected.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1335445/files/20150329041058-Web-Page-Dividers4.jpg?1427627458"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><b><h2><span style=""color: #8A0808;"">The Team:</span></h2></b><p><br/></p><p><b>Leila Witkin - Producer<br/></b></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1333045/files/20150328043142-Leila_Witkin-Legacy_500-2011_056.jpg?1427542302"" src="""" style=""width: 621.112px; height: 412px;""/></p><br/>

Leila Witkin is bright and skilful as a performer, director and producer.  <br/><br/>She possesses a remarkable and fascinating background that, with many twists and turns, has produced a fully integrated and well-rounded individual with a passion for all fields of the performing arts.

<br/><br/>She is totally capable of taking her background and expertise towards working in a positive way for creating new and inspiring projects in the theatre.

So who exactly is Leila Witkin? First of all, her mother was a very successful theatre director and the performing “bug” hit Leila when she was only five years old.  <br/><br/>Alas, she was also a shy child and needed to find a way to express her own talents and ideas.

Her father was a lawyer and, in fact, his clerk was a much younger Nelson Mandela prior to his many years of incarceration.  <br/><br/>He was the one who urged the young Leila to “find her own voice” which took on many forms over the years as she matured and developed as a person and as a professional.  





She completed her Licentiate Teachers Diploma at Trinity College of Music London in Speech and Drama.<br/><br/> At the age of fifteen she went abroad to Lausanne, Switzerland where she was a voice student and became quite successful even at that tender age.  She gave a concert where she had a standing ovation following her performance that gave her, her first big taste of stardom. 

The pressures to succeed on the stage, however, were daunting.   She made a conscientious decision to turn her focus towards obtaining a Performers Diploma in speech and drama at Cape Town University.  Severe allergies to paint and dust found in all theatres were a stumbling block to life as a performer. <br/><br/>But, undeterred and determined to follow her passion for the arts, she turned to directing both theatre and television, after attending a television production and direction course at New York University. 
 
Her first major success for which she received an award was a production of Ekhaya in 1977 in South Africa.  She worked at the South African Broadcasting Corporation where she produced and directed a weekly live magazine programme for Kidults.  She received the Star Tonight award for the best children’s programme in 1983. <br/><br/>It was while Leila was producing and directing her award-winning weekly live television programme that she was introduced to Dr. Mark Rittenberg, a charismatic educator and leader in the human development field. 

<br/><br/>He was offering coaching courses to executives using theatre skills as his method to build communication in business world.  For Leila Witkin, this was a natural progression, a way to bring together all of her background, expertise and experience of the theatre and to work with those who are challenged when standing in front of an audience. 

<br/><br/>She armed herself with credentials that were granted for completing her certification as a Personal, Corporate and Executive Coach through the Coaching Academy at the University of California at Berkeley’s Haas School of Business.  Having immigrated to the United Kingdom now almost 25 years ago, Leila Witkin has continued her association with Dr. Rittenberg over the years.  He has encouraged her to integrate her very successful skills as producer and director into her work as a coach. 

<br/><br/>Considered a leader by clients and colleagues alike, Leila Witkin has established a wise and dynamic presence in academic seminars, leadership conferences, and corporate presentations on three continents.  <br/><br/>With her extensive background in stage direction, television production, and business development, Leila Witkin is particularly attracted to celebrities and creative people for whom she has a special empathy.  

<br/><br/>A forward-looking person, surrounded with life experiences and events, who is then able to transform all of that into a novel and inventive way, can only achieve this success.  This describes Leila Witkin at this point in her own life.

'winning' entry in Tim Luscombe's <i>EuroVision
</i>(Vaudeville)! </p>
<p>Work
as an orchestrator includes the 5 Olivier Award-winning London revival of
Stephen <i>Sondheim’s Sunday in the Park
with George </i>which transferred to Broadway, winning Jason the Drama Desk
Award and a Tony Award nomination for Best Orchestrations in 2008. He has also
orchestrated the recent London productions of <i>Annie Get Your Gun</i>, <i>La Cage
Aux Folles </i>and <i>A Little Night Music </i>(currently

A new musical


Music and lyrics by Jason
Carr
Book by
Ashley Robinson






How
Lockhart Came to Be
Lockhart,
the musical, is about hope. We can all identify with it.  It celebrates who we ‘really are’ rather than
who other people want us to be. Imagine wanting to let your hair down and join
in with all the authentic personalities on stage? 
Producer
Leila Witkin has always been fascinated by the human voice and what it tells us
about a person.  The voice is the muscle
of the soul.  She has sought ways to
delve into the psyche for all individuals and to tap into the persuasive power
of successful communication.  This does,
of course, lead to opening up an entirely new world for those who previously
have been unable to portray themselves authentically.  
To
that end, Leila wrote a book that explores how one can attain those lofty, but
achievable goals, of self-awareness and ultimately become that authentic
person, especially by being able to speak in public.  Its title is UnAfraid, UnFrazzled and
UnFrogettable.  
Believe it or not, public speaking is the number one fear for most people. Comedian
Jerry Seinfeld has said that, “most people would rather be in the casket than
making the eulogy.”  We all strive to be
liked and we want to be accepted, regardless of who we are. 
And,
it sometimes takes real intestinal fortitude to be authentic and not let fear
lead the way.  It all comes down to the
question of mind-set, to no longer live falsely, but to simply be oneself.
Discovery of the true self is a valid revelation of oneself. Lockhart
illustrates this and at the same time deals with forgiveness. 
Once
the thought of creating a musical that would explore one’s individuality to
find the courage to stand up and stand out, to be different, to find one’s
authentic voice began to resonate, a call was made to Jason, to begin discussions
about creating a musical.  
He
suggested that Ashley Robinson be brought on board to create the book.
This
show is a classic American book musical in a Southern-gothic style.  It is based on the premise that is espoused
by Leila Witkin herself, her beliefs and the book that she wrote, that we all
have the right to celebrate our authentic selves.
Lockhart: Story Premise
Gilbert
Worthy, 27, is a young man stuck in Lockhart, Georgia, a dying, poor Southern
mill village that no longer has a mill – population 367.  It’s nearly an hour from even a supermarket,
a movie theater, or a Walmart.  He lives
in a tiny house in dire need of repair with his chronically ill mother Melinda.  Trapped with a cheating girlfriend, three
dead-end jobs, Gilbert has an intense longing to get out. 
One
night, he escapes to his “spot” by the river where he goes to get away and to
think, lying in the bed of his pick-up truck and just looking up at the
stars.  He feels stuck, trapped by the
isolation of his poverty-stricken town with no opportunity.  It’s like quicksand—the more you try to
escape, the deeper you sink.  But, he
feels a pull of greatness.  There’s something
better for him out there, somewhere…
As
he gazes up at the stars, he hears some commotion coming from the other bank of
the river.  Then, in the
starlight…colourful lights illuminate! 
THE FAIR is here this week; he forgot! 
The fair hasn’t been to this town since the mill closed 16 years
ago.  Gilbert is excited; it’s as though
a colourful cluster of stars has fallen to the ground.  “A cluster of stars that I can actually
reach, walk right into, a magnetic mystery pulling me into itself.”  
Gilbert
has found something extraordinary in the most unlikely place, a light in the
darkness, a mirage.  This is the opening
metaphor for finding one’s greatness where it is least expected.The Team:Leila Witkin - Producer

Leila Witkin is bright and skilful as a performer, director and producer.  She possesses a remarkable and fascinating background that, with many twists and turns, has produced a fully integrated and well-rounded individual with a passion for all fields of the performing arts.

She is totally capable of taking her background and expertise towards working in a positive way for creating new and inspiring projects in the theatre.

So who exactly is Leila Witkin? First of all, her mother was a very successful theatre director and the performing “bug” hit Leila when she was only five years old.  Alas, she was also a shy child and needed to find a way to express her own talents and ideas.

Her father was a lawyer and, in fact, his clerk was a much younger Nelson Mandela prior to his many years of incarceration.  He was the one who urged the young Leila to “find her own voice” which took on many forms over the years as she matured and developed as a person and as a professional.  





She completed her Licentiate Teachers Diploma at Trinity College of Music London in Speech and Drama. At the age of fifteen she went abroad to Lausanne, Switzerland where she was a voice student and became quite successful even at that tender age.  She gave a concert where she had a standing ovation following her performance that gave her, her first big taste of stardom. 

The pressures to succeed on the stage, however, were daunting.   She made a conscientious decision to turn her focus towards obtaining a Performers Diploma in speech and drama at Cape Town University.  Severe allergies to paint and dust found in all theatres were a stumbling block to life as a performer. But, undeterred and determined to follow her passion for the arts, she turned to directing both theatre and television, after attending a television production and direction course at New York University. 
 
Her first major success for which she received an award was a production of Ekhaya in 1977 in South Africa.  She worked at the South African Broadcasting Corporation where she produced and directed a weekly live magazine programme for Kidults.  She received the Star Tonight award for the best children’s programme in 1983. It was while Leila was producing and directing her award-winning weekly live television programme that she was introduced to Dr. Mark Rittenberg, a charismatic educator and leader in the human development field. 

He was offering coaching courses to executives using theatre skills as his method to build communication in business world.  For Leila Witkin, this was a natural progression, a way to bring together all of her background, expertise and experience of the theatre and to work with those who are challenged when standing in front of an audience. 

She armed herself with credentials that were granted for completing her certification as a Personal, Corporate and Executive Coach through the Coaching Academy at the University of California at Berkeley’s Haas School of Business.  Having immigrated to the United Kingdom now almost 25 years ago, Leila Witkin has continued her association with Dr. Rittenberg over the years.  He has encouraged her to integrate her very successful skills as producer and director into her work as a coach. 

Considered a leader by clients and colleagues alike, Leila Witkin has established a wise and dynamic presence in academic seminars, leadership conferences, and corporate presentations on three continents.  With her extensive background in stage direction, television production, and business development, Leila Witkin is particularly attracted to celebrities and creative people for whom she has a special empathy.  

A forward-looking person, surrounded with life experiences and events, who is then able to transform all of that into a novel and inventive way, can only achieve this success.  This describes Leila Witkin at this point in her own life.

<p><b>Back up. What's a Song Cycle?</b></p>
<p>Oh, right. A<span style=""background-color: initial;""> song cycle is basically the musical theatre version of a concept album. It's an hour of songs connected by a theme and musical motifs. Unlike a traditional musical, there is no overarching narrative, but rather smaller narratives contained within the songs that feature different characters. This will be a fun challenge for the actors, as there are only three of them. :P</span></p>
<p><b>Performed live?</b></p>
<p>Yep! Like a cabaret. But more interconnected. Halfway between a cabaret and a musical, I guess.</p>
<p><b>Got it. Continue...</b></p>
<p>Cool. So, ""Hyperlink"" came about when I was a student at NYU under the guidance of Julianne Wick Davis. The concept was inspired by a couple of articles by David Wong and Leigh Alexander in which they described new forms of emotions invented by the Internet. As an avid internet-user and someone chronically fascinated by humanity, I knew this was something I had to dig into.</p>
<p>Because after all, the internet isn't made of ""a series of tubes"" or a bunch of pre-installed modems. It's made of people.</p>
<p>And that's kinda cool.</p>
<p>Also, terrifying.</p>
<p>That's what ""Hyperlink"" explores.</p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>Alright, but why ask for money now?</h3>
<div>Because ""Hyperlink"" is happening! ""Hyperlink"" will be presented in its entirety at the Metropolitan Room in New York City on July 20th, 2016.</div>

<div><b>So, what happens if you make money from this?</b></div>
<div>Should there be any profit after all expenses have been paid, the money will go directly towards funding future performances &amp; projects.</div>

</div></div>","What Is ""Hyperlink""? Hyperlink is a new song cycle - 
Back up. What's a Song Cycle?
Oh, right. A song cycle is basically the musical theatre version of a concept album. It's an hour of songs connected by a theme and musical motifs. Unlike a traditional musical, there is no overarching narrative, but rather smaller narratives contained within the songs that feature different characters. This will be a fun challenge for the actors, as there are only three of them. :P
Performed live?
Yep! Like a cabaret. But more interconnected. Halfway between a cabaret and a musical, I guess.
Got it. Continue...
Cool. So, ""Hyperlink"" came about when I was a student at NYU under the guidance of Julianne Wick Davis. The concept was inspired by a couple of articles by David Wong and Leigh Alexander in which they described new forms of emotions invented by the Internet. As an avid internet-user and someone chronically fascinated by humanity, I knew this was something I had to dig into.
Because after all, the internet isn't made of ""a series of tubes"" or a bunch of pre-installed modems. It's made of people.
And that's kinda cool.
Also, terrifying.
That's what ""Hyperlink"" explores.
   Alright, but why ask for money now?
Because ""Hyperlink"" is happening! ""Hyperlink"" will be presented in its entirety at the Metropolitan Room in New York City on July 20th, 2016.
We really want to deliver the highest quality of performance to our audience, so that's why we are starting this campaign. This money covers:

Payment for the three professional performers, two females and one male.

Marketing costs, so we can get the word out there.
Instrumentalists costs, including payment for a Musical Directors.
Director's fee.
Producer fee. (I am so fortunate to have Rachel Kunstadt on board, who founded LezCab and has produced cabarets across NYC, including Broadway Sings for PKD!)
Indiegogo's platform fee.


So, what happens if you make money from this?
Should there be any profit after all expenses have been paid, the money will go directly towards funding future performances & projects.
Cool... but what can I get?
Besides the emotional benefit of helping new artists?
Yes. Besides that.
Well, I've got some cool perks lined up! How about... tickets to see the show?

What if I'm not in NYC?
Then maybe you'd like some public adoration. I've got social media shoutouts and program recognition.
Got anything custom-made?
Glad you asked. For higher-tier rewards, I will write you a custom Thank You song and post it on YouTube.
Additionally, we have a reward tier wherein digital artist and moderator of the internet sensation Scamp the Corgi, Katie Fiete, will draw you a custom avatar! Send her a picture of your dog - or any dog - and your favorite Broadway character, and she will put them together. Wow.
That's kind of cute.
It's really cute. Look at this. Here's a corgi.

<p><b>The Unfortunates - Solo Chicago
Theatre</b></p>
<p>Help us produce
this haunting, one-woman show.  Based on
a true story <i>The Unfortunates</i> is set
in Victorian London, and follows Mary-Jane Kelly, a down on her luck
“unfortunate.”  One night, she encounters
a stranger alone in her local tavern. 
Will this mysterious gentleman buy her safety for the night or turn out
to be Jack the Ripper?</p>
<p>This stunning tour-de-force stars Gail Rastorfer with direction by Kurt Johns. <i>The Unfortunates</i> promises to tell a chilling and unexpectedly humorous story.  Help us tell that story.<br/></p>
<p><b><u>SoloChicago Theatre Company</u></b></p>
<p>Founded by Chicago
theatre veteran Ronald Keaton in 2014, SoloChicago is creating a home for
solo performance artists.  Our mission is
to develop, encourage, and celebrate solo theatrical performance and work that
embodies the spirit of the individual artist. 
We have thought long and hard about the easy path of becoming an “old white guys” club or the Churchill group. But we seek a path of balance...to tell stories that need to be heard by the people who need to tell them. We aspire to create, at the highest professional level, a body of work
that is worthy of national recognition and the pride that we have in Chicago Style Theatre.  </p>
<p>SoloChicago’s
inaugural production <i>Churchill</i> was created and performed by founder Ronald Keaton under the direction of Artistic Director Kurt Johns.  It ran at the Greenhouse Theatre Center
for multiple extensions and earned Mr.
Keaton a Joseph Jefferson award for excellence in Chicago theatre.  CHURCHILL subsequently opened a
successful Off-Broadway run  at the Shubert-Owned New World Stages and is now seeking bookings across the US.</p>
<p>Even though we enjoyed artistic success with <i>Churchill</i>, SoloChicago came out of that experience with not enough money to produce our next endeavor. So in order to reach our goals artistically, we continue to work towards our financial goals to keep producing quality solo theatre. We need your support to make <i>The Unfortunates</i> a success.</p>
<p><span>SoloChicago Theatre Company is a sponsored project of Fractured Atlas, a non-profit arts service organization. Contributions for the charitable purposes of SoloChicago Theatre Company must be made payable to Fractured Atlas only and are tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law.</span><br/></p>
<p><b>The Play.</b><br/></p>
<p><b>London, November 1888.</b><span>  Mary Jane Kelly is
out tonight on Dorset Street in Whitechapel. 
She is an “unfortunate.”  She
needs money and to get out of the cold. 
In the shadows, one of the world’s most notorious murderers waits.   </span><br/></p>
<p>The captivating script, written by Aoise Stratford, is
based on the true story of Mary Jane Kelly, Jack the Ripper's last proven victim. <i>The Unfortunates</i> stars Gail Rastorfer as Mary and is directed by SCT Artistic Director Kurt Johns. It has been called “haunting…engrossing” by The New
York Times.  TimeOut New York gave it 4
stars, saying, ""it achieves a rare combination of pathos and humor,
breathing fresh life into women we might have otherwise think of only as
long-dead prey.”</p>
<p><b><i>The Unfortunates</i> by Aoise Stratford</b><br/></p>
<p><b>Playing at Theater Wit, 1229 W
Belmont, Chicago<br/>
June 17 – July 10 (Opening Night is June 20).</b></p>

</div>
<p><b>What We Need</b></p>
<p>Your support is vital to our storytelling – from rights,
costumes and theatre rental, to paying the artists and marketing the show -
producing theatre is costly. As a new theatre company, your contributions, no
matter the size, mean so much to us.  We
invite you to helps us tell our stories and nurture solo theatre artists.  Please consider donating today – your
contributions will be used for things like:</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Marketing:  posters,
postcards, and online content<br/><span>·</span><span> 
</span><span>Media:  photography,
video, and other content<br/></span><span>·</span><span> 
</span><span>Press &amp; Publicity<br/></span><span>·</span><span> 
</span><span>Production:  lighting,
sound, costuming, props, artist fees </span></p><p><b>What You Get</b><br/></p><div>
</div><p>Charitable
contributions are crucial to our mission of producing solo work of the highest
professional level. Without you, we would not exist. Please consider making a
secure, tax-deductible donation to SoloChicago today! With your generous gift,
you can partner with us to produce compelling and thought provoking solo work.</p><div>
</div><p>Besides our invitation to join us on
this adventure, we want to show you how important you are to us. Ticket sales
account for only a small portion of our operating expenses and the generosity
of our supporters will help us to continue. Every supporter will receive
our heartfelt thanks, along with a variety of perks at each level of giving, including:  </p><div>
</div><p>·<span> 
</span>SoloChicago Theatre merchandise<br/><span>·</span><span> 
</span><span>Autographed production playbill or poster<br/></span><span>·</span><span> 
</span><span>Free tickets to the show<br/></span><span>·</span><span> 
</span><span>And more!</span></p><div>
</div><p><b>The Impact</b></p><div>
</div><p>Why support solo performance? As theatre artists, we are
storytellers, and we are uniquely challenged to weave stories using just one
voice and just one body. The solo process is full of challenges and opportunity,
and offers a truly engaging and intimate theatre experience unlike any
other.   </p><div>
</div><p>Like any production, there are risks and challenges to
overcome.  As a non-profit organization
with 501(c)(3) status in process, our biggest challenge is financial.  ticket sales alone are not enough to support
the work.  That’s where you come in.  Please consider making a donation, made
tax-deductible through our affiliation with Fractured Atlas.  Please help us continue telling our stories.</p><ul>

The Unfortunates - Solo Chicago
Theatre
Help us produce
this haunting, one-woman show.  Based on
a true story The Unfortunates is set
in Victorian London, and follows Mary-Jane Kelly, a down on her luck
“unfortunate.”  One night, she encounters
a stranger alone in her local tavern. 
Will this mysterious gentleman buy her safety for the night or turn out
to be Jack the Ripper?
This stunning tour-de-force stars Gail Rastorfer with direction by Kurt Johns. The Unfortunates promises to tell a chilling and unexpectedly humorous story.  Help us tell that story.
SoloChicago Theatre Company
Founded by Chicago
theatre veteran Ronald Keaton in 2014, SoloChicago is creating a home for
solo performance artists.  Our mission is
to develop, encourage, and celebrate solo theatrical performance and work that
embodies the spirit of the individual artist. 
We have thought long and hard about the easy path of becoming an “old white guys” club or the Churchill group. But we seek a path of balance...to tell stories that need to be heard by the people who need to tell them. We aspire to create, at the highest professional level, a body of work
that is worthy of national recognition and the pride that we have in Chicago Style Theatre.  
SoloChicago’s
inaugural production Churchill was created and performed by founder Ronald Keaton under the direction of Artistic Director Kurt Johns.  It ran at the Greenhouse Theatre Center
for multiple extensions and earned Mr.
Keaton a Joseph Jefferson award for excellence in Chicago theatre.  CHURCHILL subsequently opened a
successful Off-Broadway run  at the Shubert-Owned New World Stages and is now seeking bookings across the US.
Even though we enjoyed artistic success with Churchill, SoloChicago came out of that experience with not enough money to produce our next endeavor. So in order to reach our goals artistically, we continue to work towards our financial goals to keep producing quality solo theatre. We need your support to make The Unfortunates a success.
SoloChicago Theatre Company is a sponsored project of Fractured Atlas, a non-profit arts service organization. Contributions for the charitable purposes of SoloChicago Theatre Company must be made payable to Fractured Atlas only and are tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law.
The Play.
London, November 1888.  Mary Jane Kelly is
out tonight on Dorset Street in Whitechapel. 
She is an “unfortunate.”  She
needs money and to get out of the cold. 
In the shadows, one of the world’s most notorious murderers waits.   
The captivating script, written by Aoise Stratford, is
based on the true story of Mary Jane Kelly, Jack the Ripper's last proven victim. The Unfortunates stars Gail Rastorfer as Mary and is directed by SCT Artistic Director Kurt Johns. It has been called “haunting…engrossing” by The New
York Times.  TimeOut New York gave it 4
stars, saying, ""it achieves a rare combination of pathos and humor,
breathing fresh life into women we might have otherwise think of only as
long-dead prey.”
The Unfortunates by Aoise Stratford
Playing at Theater Wit, 1229 W
Belmont, Chicago
June 17 – July 10 (Opening Night is June 20).
Tickets (starting at $38 and subject to

   What We Need & What You Get 

What We Need
Your support is vital to our storytelling – from rights,
costumes and theatre rental, to paying the artists and marketing the show -
producing theatre is costly. As a new theatre company, your contributions, no
matter the size, mean so much to us.  We
invite you to helps us tell our stories and nurture solo theatre artists.  Please consider donating today – your
contributions will be used for things like:
· 
Marketing:  posters,
postcards, and online content· 
Media:  photography,
video, and other content· 
Press & Publicity· 
Production:  lighting,
sound, costuming, props, artist fees What You Get
Charitable
contributions are crucial to our mission of producing solo work of the highest
professional level. Without you, we would not exist. Please consider making a
secure, tax-deductible donation to SoloChicago today! With your generous gift,
you can partner with us to produce compelling and thought provoking solo work.
Besides our invitation to join us on
this adventure, we want to show you how important you are to us. Ticket sales
account for only a small portion of our operating expenses and the generosity
of our supporters will help us to continue. Every supporter will receive
our heartfelt thanks, along with a variety of perks at each level of giving, including:  
· 
SoloChicago Theatre merchandise·

The Impact
Why support solo performance? As theatre artists, we are
storytellers, and we are uniquely challenged to weave stories using just one
voice and just one body. The solo process is full of challenges and opportunity,
and offers a truly engaging and intimate theatre experience unlike any
other.   
Like any production, there are risks and challenges to
overcome.  As a non-profit organization
with 501(c)(3) status in process, our biggest challenge is financial.  ticket sales alone are not enough to support
the work.  That’s where you come in.  Please consider making a donation, made
tax-deductible through our affiliation with Fractured Atlas.  Please help us continue telling our stories.

is a Grand Rapids-based comedy and entertainment group, with a focus
on pop culture and geekery. Simply put, we're the people you put in
lockers in high school, but we grew a sense of humor about it. We're
built entirely of local comedians, and we want to make comedy even
bigger and more accessible in GR. You can see an entire show for
free, just by

</p><p><b>SO WHY SHOULD YOU GET MY MONEY?</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>	Do you like
laughing? Perhaps more than once per year? Then let us turn your hard
earned dollars into hearty chuckles! Meeting our fundraising goal
will allow us to afford theater space, promotion, and printing for an
entire season of shows. We're looking at doing three types of shows
in 2016:</p>
<p>
</p><p>	-FANFICTION
SHOWS: Our classic fan favorite. We put endless thought and
creativity into lampooning, skewering, and otherwise ruining your
favorite things, in ways you never knew you wanted, but you
<i>definitely </i>do.</p>
<p>	-FANTASY/SCI-FI
SHOWS: Original stories with a focus on comedy! We build wonderful
little universes and work with new concepts, crafting a unique base
for innovative storytelling, and then we throw it all away on dick
jokes. The <i>highest quality</i>
dick jokes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>	-THEME
SHOWS: We select a theme for each of our stories to follow. We don't
mean themes like “ill-fated romances” or “the hero's journey”.
Themes like “Nicholas Cage”. Do you want a comedy show about Nic
Cage? Of course you do. Why would we even have to ask.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>BUT
WHAT DO I GET?</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>	Dazzling
array of shows not enough for you? It's cool, it's cool, we get it.
You want something for your money. Something real, something
tangible. Well, let us tell you something, buddy: <i>have we
got the rewards for you. </i>Throw
us a little bit of cash, and you can get...</p>
<p>
</p><p> <b>$10:
</b>A neato Nerdaissance
sticker! Put it anywhere that you want people to know you're cool. We
hear that visibly supporting independent artists can increase your
opportunity for sexual encounters by 3000 percent.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>	$20:
</b>Two free tickets to a
Nerdaissance show of your choosing, and a shout-out at the show you
attend, so that everyone present can hear just how kind and giving
and generous you are, you bighearted so-and-so. Impress your date!
You might get to 2<sup>nd</sup>!</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>	$50:
</b>A season pass to every
Nerdaissance show in 2016! Never miss a joke or a chance to stare at
our stunningly passable cast, AND you get a show for free, you
money-smart dog!</p>
<p>
</p><p> <b>$75:
</b>We write YOU into one of
OUR stories, and a free ticket to the show! You'll be famous and
considered hilarious without ever having to tell a funny
joke. Just like Dane Cook!</p>

Nerdaissance
is a Grand Rapids-based comedy and entertainment group, with a focus
on pop culture and geekery. Simply put, we're the people you put in
lockers in high school, but we grew a sense of humor about it. We're
built entirely of local comedians, and we want to make comedy even
bigger and more accessible in GR. You can see an entire show for
free, just by
clicking here, and you can follow us on Facebook for future content, too.


SO WHY SHOULD YOU GET MY MONEY?

	Do you like
laughing? Perhaps more than once per year? Then let us turn your hard
earned dollars into hearty chuckles! Meeting our fundraising goal
will allow us to afford theater space, promotion, and printing for an
entire season of shows. We're looking at doing three types of shows
in 2016:

	-FANFICTION
SHOWS: Our classic fan favorite. We put endless thought and
creativity into lampooning, skewering, and otherwise ruining your
favorite things, in ways you never knew you wanted, but you
definitely do.
	-FANTASY/SCI-FI
SHOWS: Original stories with a focus on comedy! We build wonderful
little universes and work with new concepts, crafting a unique base
for innovative storytelling, and then we throw it all away on dick
jokes. The highest quality
dick jokes.

	-THEME
SHOWS: We select a theme for each of our stories to follow. We don't
mean themes like “ill-fated romances” or “the hero's journey”.
Themes like “Nicholas Cage”. Do you want a comedy show about Nic
Cage? Of course you do. Why would we even have to ask.

BUT
WHAT DO I GET?

	Dazzling
array of shows not enough for you? It's cool, it's cool, we get it.
You want something for your money. Something real, something
tangible. Well, let us tell you something, buddy: have we
got the rewards for you. Throw
us a little bit of cash, and you can get...

 $10:
A neato Nerdaissance
sticker! Put it anywhere that you want people to know you're cool. We
hear that visibly supporting independent artists can increase your
opportunity for sexual encounters by 3000 percent.

	$20:
Two free tickets to a
Nerdaissance show of your choosing, and a shout-out at the show you
attend, so that everyone present can hear just how kind and giving
and generous you are, you bighearted so-and-so. Impress your date!
You might get to 2nd!

	$50:
A season pass to every
Nerdaissance show in 2016! Never miss a joke or a chance to stare at
our stunningly passable cast, AND you get a show for free, you
money-smart dog!

 $75:
We write YOU into one of
OUR stories, and a free ticket to the show! You'll be famous and
considered hilarious without ever having to tell a funny
joke. Just like Dane Cook!
	$150:
A custom story and ticket
to its show! Want to hear a tale about aliens getting high? Do you
want to know how hilariously gross it would be if She-Ra and Snarf
banged? The answer is “very”, but we can tell you exactly how if
you donate enough money to make it happen! 




WHAT
IF YOU GET TOO MUCH MONEY?

Don't
be silly. This is America. There is no such thing.

	However,
if we meet our main goal, we've certainly got plans to go even
further! 


 $4000:
Not
only can we fund a full season of Nerdaissance shows, we can also
build a studio!
Building a studio will allow us to make even more content all year
round, and make it all available online, so you can laugh at us any
time you like! Our families already do!

 $10,000:
This
is the big leagues. A full season of shows, a new studio, AND all
new equipment! With
your generous help, we can get high quality equipment, making
production even easier, and eliminating all possibility of sounding
like we shout jokes in a wind tunnel.

ARE YOU DONE TALKING YET?Yes! Just remember, every little bit helps, and if you can't donate, spread the word! Every time you share our campaign, our Facebook, or our YouTube channel with someone, it adds 4.2 seconds to each Nerdaissance member's lifespan and briefly warms our cold, charred little hearts.92.4% of all unfunded comedy troupes remain stuck in sitcom poses.

Every aspect of TPS' operation is run entirely by students - from production to direction to performance - and it's all run on a limited budget. Past highlights include our annual Rocky Horror Picture Show shadow cast, William Shakespeare's Land of the Dead (2013), Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog (2014), Almost, Maine (2014), The Room (2015), The Complete Works of William Shakespeare, Abridged (2015), and A Brain, An Athlete, A Basket Case, A Princess, and A Criminal (2016). TPS will also be producing a full-scale production of High School Musical On Stage in April of 2016. <br/><br/>Our upcoming production is Rhinoceros, written by French playwright Eugene Ionesco in 1959, is an absurdist comedy about a small provincial town in France in which many of its residents turn into rhinoceroses, without any explanation. The show focuses on Berenger, a drunk and slovenly bachelor who grows increasingly afraid of and paranoid towards the encroaching rhinoceros threat. </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>TPS has five productions under way this school year. In the past, we've rarely done more than two. While most productions are funded by a combination of ticket sales, donations, and assistance from Chapman's Student Government Association, the increase in productivity, combined with the growing scale of TPS productions, creates a need for additional funding.  We are asking for $500 from the community, which will go towards the purchase of makeup and prosthetic equipment, set building, costumes, and the purchase of a new, TPS-owned PA system, which will be used in future TPS productions as well as this one.</p>
<p>TPS prides itself on the personal touch that we put on our productions, and our perks include free admission to the show itself and several opportunities to get to know the cast and crew personally. We value collaboration over nearly everything else, and your contribution makes you a part of the family. <br/></p>

<h1>WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT?</h1>
<p><b>CHERCHEZ LA FEMME</b> is a musical extravaganza that tells the story of one man's loss and another man's gain and the powerful women who make it all possible. It explores dark themes (abandonment, sibling rivalry, unrequited love) and light themes (sexual healing, the pursuit of happiness,  the smell of success) but never without inviting you to shake your head and tap your toes to the infectious neo-urban-jungle grooves. The play is set in New York City and the Caribbean in the 1980's. It's reckless. It's rhythmic. It's romantic. </p>

<p>30 years ago Vivien Goldman interviewed me in London for a magazine called NME. My alter ego, KID CREOLE, had just released an album entitled TROPICAL GANGSTERS on the Island Records label. It was a hit. The interview lasted 3 hours and 35 minutes. A friendship was formed. 7 years ago Vivien visited me in my home in the idyllic Swedish countryside. We joked about writing a musical.

In the Spring of last year, a staged reading of that play (in its 7th re-write) was presented at the LaMama rehearsal space.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>I recently did some work with this studio that was such an integral part in my development as a professional hip hop dancer. I was shocked and heartbroken to hear that it was on the brink of closure. After talking with the director, I quickly realized where some of the problems were, and I know a company that could help fix these problems. I have some experience in the dance community, and if there is anything I know, its that we dancers have each others backs! Lets save this studio and their programs!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Dance has changed and saved so many lives. For me, without dance I would be lost in gangs and I would have no focus or discipline. Personally dance saved my life. This studio has done this for so many people over the last 6 years. The dedication to its students has helped pushed those with the talent, to succeed and exceed expectations. Dance is also a way for some of these students to further their education into higher learning. The positive outcomes from dance are infinite!</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Some of the problems stem from lack of marketing materials and distribution of materials. Enrollments are steady, but increasing costs are negating the steady enrollment rate. The studio needs a new growth of enrollment in order to continue to succeed and excel. The first step in doing this is upgrading the website. Designing new marketing materials, postcards, brochures, and to begin an advertising campaign. But money is short, so funding such a campaign is impossible without YOU!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>This is just the first step. There is so much more that needs to be done as well. Such as minor re-modelling, upgrading equipment, and creating new streams of revenue for this studio. Every dime donated will be used to further the growth of this project. Each thing that needs to be done is a single step. But all it took was one small step for man-kind to change the world!</p>

<p><strong>DECLARACIÓN: </strong>El arte desarrolla el pensamiento abstracto. El arte no tiene precio, algo muy raro hoy en día, donde todo es factible de ser comprado. Pero hay otras caras de la moneda, otras capas ocultas en el <em>establishment</em> cotidiano. ¿Cuántas vidas caben en un solo nombre, en un solo ser? El arte es la llave que abre las puertas bloqueadas por el miedo. El miedo a ser sólo yo. El arte dibuja nuevas fronteras constantemente; un artista es alguien que acepta el reto de ampliar los límites de la posibilidad. Creemos en el teatro, sobre todo en el teatro, como una herramienta para despertar. Una herramienta accesible que muestra abiertamente su misterio. En el escenario no hay magia, sino error, la posibilidad de fracasar; es decir: vida. Este trabajo, 'El mono', es un intento de comprender más capas de vida; y esperamos que esta reflexión sea significativa para el público que nos acompañe en esta ruta sin fin.<br/>  </p>
<p><strong>HISTORIA DE LA PIEZA:</strong> 'Noticias de silencio. El Mono' comienza con un relato que Eva Guillamón escribió en Dharamsala (India) en junio de 2010, tras colaborar con algunas compañías de teatro locales. En 2011 la obra resultó finalista en el Festival de Ópera Contemporánea de Houston. En abril de 2012 se estrenó en Nueva York, en colaboración con la Universidad de Nueva York.</p>
<p><br/><strong>SINOPSIS:</strong> Un héroe trágico contemporáneo se enfrenta a una rutina diaria en lo que terminará siendo su última noche. Él no habla, sólo se mueve al ritmo de su pensamiento. La palabra recae en los dos coros que dan voz a su cerebro, y realizan las actividades típicas de cada hemisferio, derecho e izquierdo respectivamente. El protagonista de 'El Mono' esta perdido en un mundo sordo, y ha renunciado a la palabra como forma de acción, con la esperanza inconsciente de alcanzar así el punto de la claridad necesaria para encontrar una pequeña grieta en una realidad tan hostil como insoportable.</p>
<p><br/><strong>DESCRIPCIÓN:</strong> 'El Mono' es una combinación de música experimental y danza contemporánea en una revisión de la tragedia griega, con la intención de reflexionar sobre el concepto ""ciudad"" (""Ciudad: es el nombre dado a una enfermedad nerviosa muy grave"", dijo el sociólogo argentino Ezequiel Martínez Estrada). Si en la tragedia griega el concepto 'polis' era inevitable para comprender al héroe clásico, hoy la ciudad es también esencial para el estudio de las características del ser humano contemporáneo: alguien con la incesante necesidad de mantener el obligado requisito que satisfaga las demandas de una sociedad que lo contiene y limita.

<p><strong>STATEMENT: </strong>Art developpes the abstract thought. Art is priceless, something very weird nowadays, where everything is able to be got by money. But there are other faces in the coin, other hidden layers among the imposed establishment. How many lives fit in a single name, in a single being? Art is the key which opens the doors buried by fear. The fear of being just me, the infinite one. Art is drawing new borders constantly; an artist, somebody who accepts the challenge of widening the limits of the possibility. We believe in theater, especially in theater, as a tool to wake us up. A cheap tool which shows its mystery openly. On the stage there's no magic but the error, the possibility of failing. It means: life. Through our work, we try to understand what life is, what it can also be; and we hope this reflection will be meaningful for the audience who come with us in this never-ending route.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>HISTORY OF THE PIECE:</strong> 'News from silence. The Monkey' begins with a short story by Eva Guillamón written in Dharamsala (India) in June 2010, where she collaborated with some indian theater companies. In 2011 the play reached the final in The Houston Contemporary Opera Festival. In April 2012 it was premiered in NY, in collaboration with the New York University.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>SYNOPSIS:</strong> A contemporary tragic hero faces an apparently daily routine which will end up to be his last day. He does not speak, just move to the rhythm of his thought. The word rests in two choirs who give voice to his brain and do the typical activities of each hemisphere, right and left. The hero of 'The Monkey' is lost in a deaf world, and he has renounced the word as a way of action; hoping for the necessary point of clarity to find a tiny crack in a reality as hostile as unbearable.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong> 'The Monkey' mixes thoroughly experimental music and contemporary dance in a review of the greek tragedy, to reflect on the concept 'city' (""City: it is the name given to a very serious nervous disorder"", said the argentinian sociologist Ezequiel Martínez Estrada). If in the greek tragedy the concept 'polis' was inevitable to understand the classic hero, today the city is also essential to study the characteristics of the contemporary human being: someone with the relentless need to keep up the common requirement to meet the demands of a society which contains and constrains them. 'The Monkey' is the first part of the trilogy 'News from Silence', a rapprochement to madness in different stages: I, individual madness; II, collective madness; III: the current social structure.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHAT DO WE NEED MONEY FOR?:</strong></p>
<p><strong>AltoFest is one of the more interesting Performing Art Festivals</strong> all around Europe. 'News from Silence. The Monkey' has been selected in its 3rd edition. And there we go from june 29th to july 3rd.</p>

called ""Tales From the American Street"" which deals with the American 
zeitgeist and the stories that lie underneath its cherished myths. 
Tales, in the form of full-length plays, that explore America's very 
particular issues of race and ethnicity, class and homelessness, war and
 culture. All have had staged readings around the New York area, with 
one - ""The Carcass"" - given full production in 2002-03 in Krakow, Poland
 (called ""Padlina"" in Polish) at the 200-seat STU Theatre, directed by 
Polish-American film-maker Hannah Sawka and ran for five sold-out 
performances before being forced to close by the then-Polish government 
for being ""subversive"". It's not, unless you call a play concerning 
race, class, war and homelessness
 during 1980's America subversive. It concerns a suburban White family 
who's brand-new shiny gold-car breaks down outside Yankee Stadium in the
 South Bronx and what happens to ""it' - the car.</p><div>The
 other plays in the series are ""Ba-Ba, the Car"", about a boyhood friend,
 a Black male deaf-mute who thought he was an automobile; ""The Stoop"", 
based on the murder of a young Black male, Yusef Hawkins, by a group of 
Italian punks, its retaliation by a group of Black punks, and a 
subsequent redemption; ""The Breadman"", about a man giving away bread on a
 Manhattan street corner and
 its ramifications; ""Indian"", where an elderly couple find their long 
lost middle-aged son on a Manhattan street; ""The Echo"", based on the 
true story of a Poughkeepsie, New York school-teacher who cannibalized a
 student; ""O Beautiful For Spacious Skies..."", a tragic-farce conjured 
from my response to the debacle that was post-Hurricane Katrina; and 
""The Artist Confronts His Materials"", the split between Art and art - as
 a painter (also) it could be thought of as my ""manifesto"" of sorts.<p></p>
<p>So,
 what am I trying to do here you may ask? Get to the point, right? I'm 
interested, no,
 more than interested, ""rabid"" about trying to get at least one of these
 plays finally produced in New York. There have been some close calls 
over the years, but the lament from most of the commercial theaters has 
been...""Great, powerful work, but I don't think this would put people in
 the seats."" Granted, they are difficult themes and the plays themselves
 are edgy and perhaps controversial, but so what? I've always thought of
 theater as more than just entertainment, but as a venue to meander 
through our cultural landscape. So...I'm determined to get them out 
there to theater-land. The problem? Lack of funding. I have a director, 
Susan Einhorn, with a long career in directing Off-Broadway and Off-off 
Broadway productions, who has access to a well-known 100-seat theater in
 Lower Manhattan, but we would need funds to stage any one of these 
""Tales From the American Street"" (at present we're discussing reprising 
""The Carcass"" for an American audience, but
 are staying flexible). The cost to stage any of them would approximate 
$35,000 (to pay the actors, lighting designer, set designer, theater 
fee, stage manager, sound person, publicity for the production, etc.) 
for a three-week showcase run and a couple weeks of rehearsals.</p>
<p>So,

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Shakespeare BASH'd went into the 2012 Toronto Fringe not knowing what to expect, and we were floored by the support and love we received from our friends, family and theatre lovers in this wonderful city we call home. Voted Best of the Fringe in 2012, we're at it again, this time bringing Shakespeares' Much Ado About Nothing to the Toronto Fringe with our signature mixture of  fun, whimsy, beer consumption and serious attention to the text. </p>

</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our 2012 Indiegogo campaign raised over $2000 to support our production, which quite literally allowed us to put on a play. Your support bought costumes, paid for rehearsal space, purchased props, and paid for promotional materials.  You are all amazing. We owe you, big.</p>
<p>And now we want to owe you bigger. Support our campaign and help us put on another award winning show. We want to see you out at the Victory Cafe again this year, and giving to this campaign will help us put together the best show possible. Plus, you'll be able to see exactly what your contribution helped when you watch Much Ado About Nothing. You're basically a producer now.  </p>
<p>Plus we'll give you perks for donating! Everything from Opening Night Tickets to a beer with our Founder, James Waliis.  It really doesn't get any better than that. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We were Best of the Fringe last year and would really like a repeat (and then a three-peat, but we're getting ahead of ourselves). Your support gives us the means to put on a killer show, which you then get to enjoy. You're investing in your own entertainment! </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please share our campaign with your friends, family, coworkers, or even your rivals. Start a bidding war. Let's get serious with it.  We'll be updating you on our progress, so you can check back here and at <a href=""http://www.shakespearebashd.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.shakespearebashd.com</a> for details on upcoming events as we lead up to the Toronto Fringe. </p>

The performers dance versions of ballet, hip hop, and jazz, as they execute shows that can last up to ten minutes. In the winter, the colorguard competes in a season traditionally known as ""winterguard"" where the colorguard is alone, performing in an indoor setting to previously recorded music. Each show has at least 4+ months of individual and ensemble practice going into the final product. In Foothill High School's colorguard, each girl puts in around twenty hours a week of their own time into the program, while attending to academics and other extracurricular activities. The 2013 Foothill Colorguard is made up of some of the best, most hardworking girls this program has seen yet. A person learning about colorguard for the first time often severely underestimates the sheer amount of passion and love these girls have for what they do, and the emerging amount of effort and determination. In addition, the skills of leadership, teamwork, and dedication acquired in colorguard not only apply to the program itself, but to real world situations these girls will encounter later on in life. Colorguard is a learning experience in itself and a place for any young girl or boy to belong, grow, and enjoy. It is every young, dedicated ""guard girl's"" or ""guard guy's"" dream to see and participate in the Winterguard International (WGI) championship competition, the highest level of the world, that takes place every April in Dayton, Ohio, and this has now become the dream of the Foothill Colorguard. The performances executed during this event are astonishing and breathtaking, like nothing anybody has ever seen before. They touch the hearts of the thousands watching from their arena seats. Nevertheless, simply getting to such a competition is a feat in itself, and not a cheap one. This project was created to raise money to fulfill the long-held dreams of seventeen girls who give several years of their lives to the challenging, yet incredibly rewarding experience that is colorguard.</p>
<p>The money raised here is put towards the trip fees for girls whose families cannot afford to go. These fees include plane tickets (as we are around two thousand miles away), hotel fees, registration, equipment, food, etc. Any donation over $50 will warrant a thank you card from all of the girls (seventeen in total) and a picture of our happy and incredibly thankful selves. Donations over $85 will receive in turn their very own mini flag: a Foothill colorguard trademark souvenir! Thank you for all of your support, and be sure to use the Indiegogo tools in order to spread the word of this dream-fufilling campaign.</p></span></div>","Colorguard is a competitive group of performers that work alongside the marching band in the summer/fall, spinning and throwing a variety of flags, rifles, sabres, and much more.

<h3>""Gym Shorts: The Show"" is a new comedy that's opening Off-Broadway in May 2013!</h3>
<p>At its core, “Gym Shorts: The Show” is about relationships. The kind of relationships we’ve all experienced in our own life, and can all identify with. The ecstasy of finding that new companion. The agony of betrayal. The struggle to be accepted for who you are.</p>
<p>All the great dramas and comedies of the ages have hinged on these profound human experiences. So, what is it that makes this rendition new and unique? And, of course, hilarious? It's set in the one place that can hold this amount of human triumph and tragedy, the blood, sweat and tears that make up the human experience (particularly the sweat):</p>
<p>THE GYM!!!</p>
<h3><strong>Who's Who in the Shorts?</strong></h3>
<p>""Gym Shorts: The Show"" is the brainchild of Eric S. Robertson, a NY-based writer and director, with a unique take on love, life, and lifting.</p>
<p>It is produced by Kermit Raphael and Lynda Sing, both NY-based fitness professionals and entrepreneurs, who are very excited to bring this unique blend of comedy and fitness to the health-conscious community of New York City!</p>
<h3>What goes into the Shorts?</h3>
Producing a new off-Broadway play is expensive - as much as $50,000.  As a contributor, your support will help pay for things like theater rental, studio rental, costumes, props, playbills, and more.  Most importantly, the salaries of the people working so hard to make this happen with us, like the set, lighting, sound and costume designers, the stage manager, and of course, the actors.<br/><br/>To say thank you for your generosity and support, we've put together series of very cool rewards.  Each one is something we think you'll like, and something we're very proud of.  Everything from signed posters to tickets to the show can be yours, just for helping us out!<br/><br/>
</div>

<h3>Help spread the Shorts!</h3>
<p>Every little bit helps, even if it's not money!</p>
<p>Please help us spread the word about our campaign, through Facebook, Twitter, word of mouth, between sets at the gyms, any way you can.<br/>Use the IndieGoGo Share Tools right here on the site.</p>

</div><p>Friends, Family, Colleagues and Teachers:</p>
<p>I'm Chris Bober and I'm directing the play ""As Bees in Honey Drown"" by Douglas Carter Beane. It's always been a dream of mine to direct a full length play in Manhattan and I'm tired of dreaming, so it's time to do some work and make it happen! </p>
<p>This script means so much to me and has become increasingly relevant throughout the years (if you're unfamiliar with it, take a look at the synopsis below). I've been living and working in NYC now for just over a year and I've learned a lot in my time here. Often times in this profession, young artists are looking to become the next big thing and fast. We want everything yesterday and are looking for a fast track to success without ever wanting to go on the journey. It's easy to get caught up in all the hype and commotion and often times we get so distracted by our own illusions, we wake up one day and realize we've been drowning, (here it comes) almost ""as bees in honey drown"". </p>
<p>I came across the work by accident during my time in college while attending the Kennedy Center American College Theatre Festival. (KCACTF) I watched it performed as one of five audience members and was blown away, not only by how intelligently written it was, but by how relevant it still was. I looked around the rest of the audience shocked and angry that more people hadn't witnessed what I did. I started to ask around and was shocked to find many of my theater friends and colleagues had never even heard of it. I decided at that point this script needed to be seen, read and performed more. People needed to hear Douglas Carter Beane's words and listen to his story. </p>
<p>I've put a lot of thought into how I can make this happen. I've assembled a team of passionate and intelligent artists. I've done my research as a director. And most importantly, I've put my faith in my network of people. (YOU!) To make this dream a reality, my team and I need your help to finance the show. As you can imagine rehearsal spaces, rights, performance venues, lights, props, costumes, etc. are all very expensive. We are on a short timeline and need to reach our goal if this is going to happen. Any and all donations, no matter how big or small are greatly appreciated! Let's do this!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Chris Bober</p><p><span><br/></span>*The following synopsis was extracted from the play's web listing by Dramatists Play Service.</p><p>THE STORY: Evan Wyler has just finished a photo session with his shirt off. No, he's not a supermodel; he's a twenty-something New York writer savoring the success of his debut novel. Defined by the media as the ""hot-young"" thing-of-the-moment, Evan captures the attention of Alexa Vere de Vere, a black-clad woman of mystery who's made the world of celebrity her home. In fact, it's her religion. Maybe she's a record producer, maybe she's a film agent; what is clear is that she wants Evan to write the screenplay of her life story. Just spend time with me, she says, and you'll learn all you need to know. To Evan, who is gay, it's like an invitation into the world of Auntie Mame, Sally Bowles and Holly Golightly all rolled into one. But once Evan fools himself into believing he loves Alexa, she vanishes, leaving him to foot the bill for all the dinners and Armani suits they've gone through. Trying to find Alexa, Evan discovers a chain of people who have fallen under her spell and acted as her meal ticket. For Alexa has no money, no job, no life of her own—only the one she's created for herself.

The PQ is the world's largest event dedicated to scenography and over 70 countries participate. There are three divisions to explore; the professional exhibition and competition, the student exhibition and the architecture exhibition. We will have the opportunity to learn from and view the work of top industry professionals as well as submit our own work for display. Along with the exhibitions, hundreds of workshops, lectures and performances take place all over the city. For ten days we will be immersed in the best of our industry and our personal growth as artists will be extensive. To compliment our time at the PQ, we will spend our time in the streets of Prague sketching and learning about the architecture and history of this great city. </div>

<b>The Theatre Designers</b><br/>
</div>
<div>We are 12 Bachelor of Fine Arts and Master of Fine Arts in Theatre Design students training at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.<b> </b>Our unique program provides us with an extensive education in set, costume and lighting design through theoretical and realized work. We are taught hands on practical skills that are applicable to the industry and exposed to professional level productions through our own design projects, practicum work and through assistant assignments. Our studio projects are diverse and challenging ranging from surrealist plays to ballets to operas. Each project is critiqued by a panel allowing us to constantly take a deeper look at our own work. It is an extremely important part of our education to attend the PQ as a way to be exposed to the theatre that is happening outside of our community and all over the world. </div>

<div><b>Our Goal</b></div>
<div>We are determined to cover the cost of the plane ticket for all 12 students. Flying from Canada to Europe isn't cheap. It will be about $1200 per student making our goal a grand total of $14,400. This campaign isn't our only effort.

<h3>About Us</h3>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Established at the University of York in 2003,
Central Hall Musical Society boasts a rich history of brilliant musical productions, including </span><i style=""background-color: initial;"">West Side Story</i><span style=""background-color: initial;"">, </span><i style=""background-color: initial;"">Into the Woods</i><span style=""background-color: initial;""> and most recently an acclaimed run of </span><i style=""background-color: initial;"">Jesus Christ Superstar </i><span style=""background-color: initial;"">which cemented
its status as a company of students wholly dedicated to producing a truly
outstanding theatrical experience both for audience members and performers
alike. </span></p>
<p>Fundraising ventures so far have included Krispy Kreme doughnut sales, live music events, sing-along film screenings, christmas caroling and daily bake sales, with quizzes, open mic nights and flash mobs all in the pipeline!</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;""><b>Making the Magic Happen</b></span></p>
</div><div> <p><i>The Witches of Eastwick</i> <span style=""background-color: initial;"">combines West-End sparkle with a witty black comedy perfect for musical theatre lovers and virgins alike. Its libretto calls for comic prowess, show-stopping dance numbers and brilliant musical talent which CHMS are sure to deliver in droves, but to truly enchant our audiences we need just a little bit of fairy dust, and that's where you come in.</span></p>
<p>Money raised for the production will go towards ensuring that our show reaches the professional standard that we aspire to. Bespoke costumes and larger-than-life set structures don't come cheap and our combined set, costume and prop budgets exceed £2000.</p>
<p>In addition to the standard theatrical magic - no show about modern day witches would be complete without real illusions and some of the special effects we've prepared include self-playing cellos, disappearing tennis balls and of course the infamous flying sequence that closes the first act - we won't give away any secrets but enchantments like these as well as spectacular sound and lighting effects are set to cost in the region of £6,800.</p>

Having already raised close to £5000, in the final weeks leading up to the show The Witches of Eastwick team aim to raise another £4000 to cover the costs of the production and your support in helping us reach this target would be greatly appreciated. 



About Us

Established at the University of York in 2003,
Central Hall Musical Society boasts a rich history of brilliant musical productions, including West Side Story, Into the Woods and most recently an acclaimed run of Jesus Christ Superstar which cemented
its status as a company of students wholly dedicated to producing a truly
outstanding theatrical experience both for audience members and performers
alike. 
Fundraising ventures so far have included Krispy Kreme doughnut sales, live music events, sing-along film screenings, christmas caroling and daily bake sales, with quizzes, open mic nights and flash mobs all in the pipeline!
Making the Magic Happen
 The Witches of Eastwick combines West-End sparkle with a witty black comedy perfect for musical theatre lovers and virgins alike. Its libretto calls for comic prowess, show-stopping dance numbers and brilliant musical talent which CHMS are sure to deliver in droves, but to truly enchant our audiences we need just a little bit of fairy dust, and that's where you come in.
Money raised for the production will go towards ensuring that our show reaches the professional standard that we aspire to. Bespoke costumes and larger-than-life set structures don't come cheap and our combined set, costume and prop budgets exceed £2000.
In addition to the standard theatrical magic - no show about modern day witches would be complete without real illusions and some of the special effects we've prepared include self-playing cellos, disappearing tennis balls and of course the infamous flying sequence that closes the first act - we won't give away any secrets but enchantments like these as well as spectacular sound and lighting effects are set to cost in the region of £6,800.







After the final curtain...
 Any revenue will be reinvested in the
development of the society which organises workshops for students from visiting
professionals, as well as all-inclusive showcases, outreach projects and community busking trips.

Central Hall Musical Society provides aspiring
young professionals with an incomparable chance to manage all aspects of a high
calibre production and with your help we can make The Witches of Eastwick  a creative and financial triumph ensuring
that this legacy can continue in future years.",2.0,0,"1 Campaign
