<h2>Our Story</h2>
<p>Hi! I am James and I am the founder of Pixors. My story
started 25 years ago when I was learning how to write and draw. My parents
bought me and my siblings color pencils and sketchpads so that we can learn how
to draw. Drawing was fun, until we have exhausted all of the sketchpads. The
next thing that comes close to an empty paper is the white, large walls. When
our parents are out to work, we started decorating the walls. I cannot seem to
recall what happened later when our parents came back, it must have been an
unpleasant memory.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 1998 when my dad bought us our first
computer, the first thing we learnt was playing computer games. Back then, all
the games we played were mostly pixelated. Yes, most mainstream games looked
like Minecraft in 2D. Later, as graphic cards become more powerful and were
able to support higher resolution graphics, pixelate games have slowly eroded
away from mainstream games (though there are still some indie game developers still stick to
pixelated graphics).</p>
<p>In 2015, even though all digital elements are still made of
pixels, we really cannot see them with our naked eyes because the
resolutions are so highly packed together. Also, pixel art only exists in a
digital format and there isn't an efficient way for people to make pixel art in
real life. That was when I got the idea to create Pixors.</p>

<h2>Design &amp; Manufacturing</h2>
<p>Every product started out with a simple idea. However, time,
sweat and effort determine whether it will be a great product. Creating Pixors
is no different. Since January 2015, we have been experimenting, testing,
prototyping and refining Pixors. </p>
<h3>Raw Material</h3>
<p>Pixors rely heavily around the sticker raw material. Therefore, we waste no effort and resources to ensure that Pixors stickers fulfill the following criteria:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Repositionable stickers so it is error proof.</li>
<li>Removable without damaging walls.</li>
<li>Self-adhesive and easy to use.</li>
<li>Pixel art created by Pixors must last a long period of time.</li>
<li>Pixel art must be able to stick to most wallsurfaces.</li>
<li>Must be at least waterproof.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438504941/g6kpzurqdddphl5mvlkr.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We’ve had conducted many experiments on stickers. Some left
residues when peeled off the wall. Some lost its adhesiveness after a couple of peel offs. Many stickers took the painting off the walls at home. We found that
only a limited types of stickers fit the bill. So we got to work.</p>
<h3>Manufacturers</h3>
<p>We have approached many manufacturers over the past few
months. After spending a lot of time working with multiple suppliers and
filtering through them, I believe we have found the necessary people and the
equipment required to manufacture Pixors in bulk. In the beginning, we
manufactured different 10mm and 15mm sticker sizes, both are suitable for
adults. However, our tests have shown that children work better with 15mm
stickers. Therefore, we have decided to produce the Pixors stickers in a standard
15mm size. </p>
<h3>Design</h3>
<p>With the raw material and manufacturing aspect of Pixors all
laid out, the next step is to design the product. Pixel art has always been an
inspiration for me, it brings back nostalgic moments of the days of pixel
graphics in games. Our main challenge with the designs is the number of pixels
used in an art. We want to use the minimum possible pixels to create the best-looking
pixel art. On the other side, we also want to create really large wall pixel
art murals. Therefore, we have created a panoramic view of cities. With a little
twist of imagination, we can design city pixel art to look like the background
for games.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438505173/xfyjpmee0g5npnsxlbrx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>Prototyping &amp; Testing in Kindergartens</h3>
<p>When we designed Pixors, we designed it for adults for
object decorations. However, when we trialed Pixors, we tested it out in
kindergartens with children aged 4 to 7. We couldn't decorate the walls in the
kindergartens, so we created a Pixors Children’s Pack. Pixors Children Pack
consists of a specially laminated A3 template, a guide card and Pixors
stickers.</p>
<p>I invited Eunice, a child
education specialist to help me with the kindergarten classes. With her help, it didn't take much time for the children to know what they were supposed
to do. We discovered that most kids were immediately engaged with the activity.
Initially, children would find it difficult to accurately place the stickers in
the square boxes. But with the teachers' guidance, we had noticed improvements
in children using Pixors. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438505357/tp29voqkftc2ffa6ww2w.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We observed the following:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Improvement in hand-eye coordination.</li>
<li>Increased patience level in children.</li>
<li>A dramatic progress in fine motor skills.</li>
<li>Learns color, objects names, numbers and alphabets.</li>
<li>Great sense of achievement and satisfaction upon completion of work.</li>

<h2>Is Pixors Children/Human Friendly?</h2>
<p>The health and safety document provided by the manufacturing
company suggests that the PVC films used to manufacture Pixors is harmless to
both children and adults. All fire extinguishing methods can be used on Pixors
in case of fire. The self-adhesive compound used in Pixors films will not cause
chemical reaction in water. Medical aid is not required when touching, tasting
or inhaling the film.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, Pixors is safe for both human being and
the environment. However, swallowing the film is a choking hazard. We highly
discourage the use of Pixors for children aged three years old or younger. </p>
<h2>Why Contribute to Pixors?</h2>
<p>Prior to Pixors, most pixel arts exist in digital form. We
want to make pixel art a reality that can be created in real life. The
possibilities to create are endless! Imagine the amount of pixel art
decorations that can be created by people all around the world. Thinking of
this is enough to make us all excited. </p>
<p>On top of that, by contributing to this project, you are
also contributing to the future generation. For every $100 dollars on top of
our funding goal, we are going to conduct a free of charge Pixors workshop for
15 children. The fact is, we do not earn anything from this crowdfunding
project because we will be giving away so much with the contributions. </p>

</h3>
<p></p> <p>Based in Los Angeles, I work primarily in video, CG animation, stereoscopic 3D, and sound and light installation. I've exhibited in the U.S., Canada, and Europe in galleries, film and media festivals, and museums. Though the styles vary significantly from project to project, all of my work reflects an interest in a group of subjects: visual perception, time and dimensional space, consciousness and altered states. More information about me and my past projects can be found at <a href=""http://joemerrell.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">joemerrell.com</a>.</p>

<h3>The Eyes Are Always There</h3>
<p><i>The Eyes Are Always There</i> is an upcoming multimedia installation at <a href=""http://machineproject.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Machine Project</a> gallery in Los Angeles that explores the subjects of UFOs, alien abduction, and related anomalous phenomena. Scheduled to open in late January 2016, the show will feature 3D video, print, sculpture, as well as computer-controlled lighting and sound. In addition to my work in the first floor gallery, super-talented artist and animator <a href=""http://johnnywoods.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Johnny Woods</a> is creating an animated film to be screened in the gallery's Mystery Theater.</p>
<p><i>The Eyes Are Always There</i> is technically ambitious – more so than any of my previous projects. It's also important to point out that Johnny and I have avoided a typical pop culture take on the subject matter. Inspired by a shared long-term interest, we've drawn from specific UFO and abduction researchers in developing our work for this show. While our aim isn't necessarily to convince our audience of anything, we hope to communicate some of the range, intensity, and ""high strangeness"" of reported sightings and experiences.</p>
<p>A special program of film, video, workshops and guest speakers is being planned to accompany the installation. A blog/site will be launched to document the project and provide more information on the research informing the work in the show.</p> </div> <div> <h3></h3>

So far, only one thing is certain: it is not just a rumor: something is seen.–Dr. Carl G. Jung

I am an artist who was invited to do a show at Machine Project gallery in Los Angeles that will open in late January 2016. For more than a year, I've been developing what will be an electronic media installation that focuses on UFOs, alien abduction, and related anomalous phenomena. I am raising additional funds to help secure the materials and technology to expand some elements of the show to make it a richer, more immersive experience for gallery visitors.

<p>The memory of Steve Jobs is a source of inspiration. His humble origins, personal imperfections and the turbulence of his career make his story relatable; his prolific, world-changing career make his story admirable. Steve Jobs had flaws and was knocked down in his career. He responded by rising to even greater heights: developing life-changing, genre-defining products, revolutionizing industries, and creating billions of dollars of economic value. Steve Jobs put the emphasis on innovation and creating what has never been created. The memory of Steve Jobs is of someone for whom we relate to his lows and can aspire to reach the heights he attained.</p>
<p>Steve Jobs once said he wanted to “leave a dent in the universe”. He lived up to that and had an immense impact during his lifetime. Whether the mark he made becomes indelible remains to those who are still around. We are the bearers of his legacy. This statue will act as a reminder for the preservation of a memory worth remembering.</p>

<p></p>
<p>His passing is still relatively recent and the memory still fresh in our imaginations. Now is the time to capture our sentiments and express them before their potency fades through time. This statue is intended to instantiate the admiration we have before we forget.</p>

<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<h4>What will be done with the capital?</h4>
<p>The plan is to put the capital towards building as big of a statue possible, taking into account other anticipated costs (i.e. transportation, plaque engraving, etc). Any remaining capital will be recycled - by Realizing Utopia LLC, Monuments Series only - for similar projects.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>What qualifies you to make this statue?</h4>
<p>Not much. We can't say that we have extensive prior statue building experience. We're just huge Steve Jobs fans. We'll work with experts to make this happen.</p>
<h4>Where will the statue be located?</h4>
<p>We anticipate that the eventual location of the statue will be somewhere in the Bay Area. We will work with the project contributors to determine where to put the statue. We currently intend to hold a poll to determine preferences among campaign contributors on possible locations, and then coordinate with relevant communities to place the statue.</p>
<h4>What about other statues?</h4>
<p>After conceiving of the idea to build a statue, we performed further research. We came across the statue built in Budapest. We think that Steve Jobs is worthy of more than one statue, and that building a statue here, in the United States, would be fitting.</p>
<h4>How can we continue to contribute?</h4>
<p>Building this statue will be a team effort. We will look to actively involve contributors during the development of the statue. We are additionally planning an unveiling ceremony, for which campaign contributors will be invited (see perks). If you have any ideas for ways in which you could help with this endeavor, please reach out.</p>
<h4>Who is behind this project?</h4>
<p>We are young entrepreneurs living in San Francisco. Steve Jobs is a role model for us. We admire the work he did, and the life he lived. We want the focus to be on the statue, so we'd prefer to be more 'behind the scenes' on this project.

As far as i know there has yet to be a photo book dedicated to the style so I am putting together a collection of my photography prints to illustrate a rarely seen side of an area i know well. Dark, mysterious, beautiful aesthetic of deep south countryside and towns that goes largely unnoticed. </div><div>  I feel like this is something that needs to be shown as it seems most fail to fully grasp the depth of just how much the tone of what is ""Southern Gothic"" permeates this particular area<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">. For goodness sake in a county with a population of just over 9,000 there are 138 known cemeteries. That's like one tombstone for every two live people.

You found the dark mysterious side of the sunny south! 
 Often Depicted in literature and film the Southern Gothic is a subgenre of Gothic fiction that takes place exclusively in the American South. If your reading this you probably knew that, right? As far as i know there has yet to be a photo book dedicated to the style so I am putting together a collection of my photography prints to illustrate a rarely seen side of an area i know well. Dark, mysterious, beautiful aesthetic of deep south countryside and towns that goes largely unnoticed.   I feel like this is something that needs to be shown as it seems most fail to fully grasp the depth of just how much the tone of what is ""Southern Gothic"" permeates this particular area. For goodness sake in a county with a population of just over 9,000 there are 138 known cemeteries. That's like one tombstone for every two live people. Any ways, its everywhere here and in part im wanting this to be a kind of documentary of the vibe before time crumbles it all away. 

 For instance, this creepiest church ever... 

Its been like that for as long as i have been alive but one day it will fall and never be the same... Then, not a mile from there, this field of yellow flowers backed by a foreboding swamp...

   Down the road from there is a tomb in the forest... 




A short walk by the tomb is this house... 

Further on past the big tree...
To this cemetery...
 Where the tombstones slowly return to the earth. 

  See what i'm getting at? As bright and sunny as the areas reputation certainly deserves, it is juxtaposed with an equally forlorn paling as previous eras waste away to bones. I want to show you before its gone. 
  So about this book. 


   Fifty prints of various sizes about 5""x8"" some a little larger , some a little smaller come in a hand made wooden box (by me) with a glass and wood frame on the front, that one in the pic is made of cherry. Opens by way of a leather strap and solid copper buckle and you can even change the cover print with a favorite. Props up with a leg on the back so its also a neat picture frame! 

  On the inside you will find unbound prints. I want to take you on a tour through a ""Collection of Art""  rather than a typical book as i feel looking through them in this way is a more interactive and special experience. Rather than one of many pages, each print is its own entity. 
   I don't want to spoil the surprise so i'm leaving out most of and the best images but that should give you a good idea of what you get!    Funding.    I am doing this all myself so each book is a work of art in itself. Each book is individually funded by your contribution of 35 bucks so there isnt a risk of project failure due to funds not being met or this or that.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>On December 15th, 2011, I am going to exhibit Domestic Tension in the Jakarta Biennial XIV.  My work was selected by the Jakarta Arts Council, as one of two artists representing the United States; it is a great opportunity.<br/><br/></p>
<p>The Jakarta Biennial is a prestigious event held every two years since 1968 by the Jakarta Arts Council. Jakarta XIV – called Maximum City, Survive or Escape? – is curated by Bambang Wijanarko, Ilham Choiri and Seno Joko Suyono.<span><span class=""il"">  Jakarta</span></span> is a city of diverse society: cosmopolitan,
 adventurous, a melting pot.  The event enriches and refreshes the 
practice and discourse of arts in Indonesia, especially by engaging the 
people directly in the arts projects in public areas. In line with the 
characteristics of the “Bataviasche” who are liberal and pluralistic, 
the event also introduces directly international works to the public as a
 reference of comparison for both the local and international artistic 
community. By introducing, enhancing appreciation, and then engaging the
 people in arts, the <span><span class=""il"">Jakarta</span></span> Biennial raises the levels of tolerance and
 sympathy towards diverse creations and cultures.<span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;""></span></p>
<p><br/>My 2007 work Domestic Tension has special relevancy to the biennial theme. In Jakarta I will recreate the original installation, wherein I sequestered myself in a Chicago gallery with a paintball gun where people could shoot at me over the Internet for a month. The project was a way to provoke dialogue about the Iraq war, the technological and remote nature of modern warfare, and what it means for Iraqis to live constantly under the threat of fire. Through out the 31 day performance, over 70,000 individual shots were fired at me. I received international attention for the work and the Chicago Tribune named me the Artist of the Year in 2008 and called the dynamic installation, “one of the sharpest works of political art to be seen in a long time.”<br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The exhibition installation in Jakarta begins December 10th. Currently, myself and the project manager Nathan Suter are making arrangements for shipping the piece plus flights and accommodations for installing the piece.  Your support will help make possible these essential aspects. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>As you may know, exhibiting work and shipping crated work can be extremely costly. We need to raise $3,000 for shipping &amp; packaging, insurance, administration expenses, on-site installation costs, and transportation. The Jakarta Arts Council has generously offered $3,000 for our flights and a modest honorarium. They have also offered to cover shipping through IMS freight.  The $3,000.00 that we are raising today, through IndieGoGo, is necessary for the costs which exceed Jakarta's funding. </p>

As you may know, exhibiting work and shipping crated work can be extremely costly. We need to raise $3,000 for shipping & packaging, insurance, administration expenses, on-site installation costs, and transportation. The Jakarta Arts Council has generously offered $3,000 for our flights and a modest honorarium. They have also offered to cover shipping through IMS freight.  The $3,000.00 that we are raising today, through IndieGoGo, is necessary for the costs which exceed Jakarta's funding.

Or would cause the best scare, or had the most gruesome display. These awesome families gave their all to make Halloween not just about the candy… They made the night come alive with spooks, tricks and magic! These folks that went above and beyond, just to hear a scream or see a smile, made Halloween my favorite holiday. And I love nothing more than continuing that special tradition. By the time I was officially too old to be going Trick or Treating, I knew exactly how I wanted to spend my Halloweens. I wanted to give children the best and most frightening October 31st they could have!</p>
<p>My father, brother and I early on spent most Halloweens, just the three of us, trying our best to scare the kids. Soon after we added more props, created more terror, and handed out more candy. Eventually my group of friends became actors, prop builders and makeup artists in their time off. We put our heads together year after year to create a small home haunt that receives hundreds of kids every Halloween night. It’s called The Dread Keep!</p>

<p>And we want to make a safer, scary, fun place to go on Halloween. We never had and never will be a haunt that charges kids or adults for admittance. We simply do this for the fun! The only problem is that every year it gets harder and harder to make a bigger and better haunt. We pour our own time and funds into projects. And well… We are pretty limited when it comes to funds. That’s where you can help!</p>
<p>This year we are expanding the Haunt to another portion of our house. And we already have tons of ideas and a great classic haunt theme. The Crypt! This project is our biggest yet. By the end we will have constructed more than 125 square feet of façade walls and underground crypt, and a giant monster animatronic. With your help we can afford the supplies to build this great art piece. This project will put our construction, art, sculpting, and painting skills to the ultimate test! And we would love to have you be a part of this great project!</p>
<p>If you want to help fund our project, you will receive some awesome homemade Halloween rewards! Pledges of just $1 might not get anything in the mail. But we thank you beyond words for your support!</p>
<p>With a 10$ pledge, be assured you will get a custom made, personalized Thank You card in the mail. It will have been made by the cast and crew of Dread Keep, and will have tid bits of information, words of thanks, and some fun bios of the people who run the haunt. And that’s not all! We will also include some exclusive photos of building process and fun Halloween extras!</p>
<p>With a $30 pledge you will be sent a fun set of 10 individual, hand painted Halloween decor stones. They are great decorations to add to any Halloween party! Each stone is different and has an eerie, creepy or gross Halloween image. All hand painted and personalized, these stones are awesome for adding to a Halloween centerpieces, decoration, or candle displays!</p>

<p><strong>CONCEPT</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/435647/files/20140315113133-che_cos__l_amore.png?1394908293"" src="""" style=""width: 471.25px; height: 293px;""/></p>
<p>Sia Elena che Mariana negli anni hanno sviluppato dei progetti artistici su temi simili come l'identità e la relazione con l'altro. PASSO A DUE ha come obiettivo l'analisi del <em><strong>concetto di potere all'interno del rapporto di coppia</strong></em>, le due artiste hanno deciso di confrontarsi su questo tema e sviluppare due lavori video che indaghino proprio questo elemento relazionale. </p>
<p>I punti di partenza di Bellantoni e Ferratto sono stati due loro lavori antecedenti, nello specifico Ich bin... du bist ( Bellantoni 2010) e Ciao (Ferratto 2011). Dal confronto e dallo scambio è nata l'idea di sviluppare durante il periodo di residenza due nuove opere video, per approfondire il percorso di ricerca. </p><strong></strong>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/435650/files/20140315113250-la_relazione.png?1394908370"" src="""" style=""width: 473.36px; height: 159px;""/></strong></p>
<p><strong>CAMPAGNA</strong></p>
<p>La campagna di Crowdfunding mira a sostenere la Giovane Arte Italiana attraverso un percorso di ricerca per la realizzazione di due opere d'arte. Il sostegno diventa fondamentale ai fini della creazione artistica, sia concettualmente che concretamente. </p>
<p>I  sostenitori potranno entrare in relazione con le artiste durante il processo di creazione delle opere. La dinamica di condivisione è parte sostanziale del processo creativo richiamando direttamente il concept: la RELAZIONE. Come in una scatola cinese si parte dal rapporto tra le artiste, ci si apre verso l'esterno attraverso il crowdfunding e si rende visibile il legame sviluppato lungo il percorso nelle opere finali.</p>
<p>La residenza si concluderà con la presentazione del lavoro in cui sarà evidente ogni processo relazionale: da quello dei protagonisti dei video a quello delle artiste, al processo partecipativo innescato dalla campagna Passo a due. </p>
<p><strong>OBIETTIVI</strong></p>
<p>Il vostro supporto è funzionale a:</p>
<p>- realizzare le riprese</p>
<p>- completare i lavori di post-produzione: montaggio, sound design, color correction</p>
<p>- esposizione finale: noleggio service e allestimento</p>
<p><b>CIO’ CHE DAI E’ TUO PER SEMPRE</b>, ciò che non dai è perso per sempre. Noi cercheremo, in un rituale del corteggiamento di sedurvi con il nostro progetto, proprio come un innamorato cerca di conquistare la ragazza dei suoi sogni, offrendole, in un crescendo di coinvolgimento e pathos, una serie di doni.</p><p>Per ""sedurvi"" ancora di più abbiamo deciso di prendervi per la gola. Vi offriremo infatti, nel caso in cui vogliate omaggiarci di un anello di fidanzamento (500 €) o addirittura portarci all'altare (3000 €), un <em>BRUNCH</em> o una <em>CENA</em> presso il <strong><a href=""http://www.kitchenristorante.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">KITCHEN ristorante </a></strong>di Milano dove il vero protagonista è il cibo. Pochi tavoli in un ambiente intimo e rilassante. I migliori piatti della tradizione italiana, anche in chiave ""gluten free"" che si evolvono nel corso delle stagioni. Due orti che ne garantiscono la freschezza. La buona cucina senza compromessi. Una proposta che non potrete proprio rifiutare!</p>
<p><br/><strong>SI PUO' DARE DI PIU'</strong></p>
<p>Siamo convinti che l'amore sia il ""virus"" più contagioso al mondo, quindi, se non potete sostenerci economicamente, innamoratevi del nostro progetto:</p>
<p>- fateci arrivare migliaia di LIKE</p>
<p>- postate questo messaggio d'amore sui tutti social che conoscete</p>
<p>- riempite la nostra casella di posta del cuore</p>
<p>- attaccatevi alla cornetta e parlate a tutti del nostro progetto</p><p><b> PASSO A DUE project:<b></b></b></p><p><b></b></p><p><b><i>Passo a due</i> is a project born from the collaboration
between Elena Bellantoni and Mariana Ferratto. The two artists have been
invited at the prestigious space for Contemporary Art Careof DOCVA in Milan for
an artistic residency during the month of May 2014, and decided to develop a
project in parallel as result of a comparison between their works.</b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">Elena and Mariana have developed over the years
some artistic projects with similar themes related to the concept of identity
and relationship. <i>Passo a due</i> aims to analyse the concept of <i>power</i> within the relationship. They decided to
confront this issue and develop two video works that investigate this
relational topic. </p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">The starting points of Bellantoni and Ferratto
were two of their previous work, specifically Ich bin du bist ... (Bellantoni
2010) and Ciao (Ferratto 2011). </p><p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p><p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>CAMPAIGN</b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">The Crowdfunding Campaign aims to support the
Young Italian Art for the realization of two works of art. The support is
fundamental to the creation of art, either conceptually and in practice. </p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">Supporters will be able to get involved with the
artists during the creation process of the works. The dynamics of sharing is a
substantial part of the creative process by directly invoking the concept: the
RELATIONSHIP. </p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">The Artistic residency will end with the
presentation of the work, where the relational and participatory processes
triggered by the <i>Passo a due </i>campaign will be evident, too.</p><p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p><p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>OBJECTIVES </b></p>

CONCEPT

Sia Elena che Mariana negli anni hanno sviluppato dei progetti artistici su temi simili come l'identità e la relazione con l'altro. PASSO A DUE ha come obiettivo l'analisi del concetto di potere all'interno del rapporto di coppia, le due artiste hanno deciso di confrontarsi su questo tema e sviluppare due lavori video che indaghino proprio questo elemento relazionale. 
I punti di partenza di Bellantoni e Ferratto sono stati due loro lavori antecedenti, nello specifico Ich bin... du bist ( Bellantoni 2010) e Ciao (Ferratto 2011). Dal confronto e dallo scambio è nata l'idea di sviluppare durante il periodo di residenza due nuove opere video, per approfondire il percorso di ricerca. 

CAMPAGNA
La campagna di Crowdfunding mira a sostenere la Giovane Arte Italiana attraverso un percorso di ricerca per la realizzazione di due opere d'arte. Il sostegno diventa fondamentale ai fini della creazione artistica, sia concettualmente che concretamente. 
I  sostenitori potranno entrare in relazione con le artiste durante il processo di creazione delle opere. La dinamica di condivisione è parte sostanziale del processo creativo richiamando direttamente il concept: la RELAZIONE. Come in una scatola cinese si parte dal rapporto tra le artiste, ci si apre verso l'esterno attraverso il crowdfunding e si rende visibile il legame sviluppato lungo il percorso nelle opere finali.
La residenza si concluderà con la presentazione del lavoro in cui sarà evidente ogni processo relazionale: da quello dei protagonisti dei video a quello delle artiste, al processo partecipativo innescato dalla campagna Passo a due. 
OBIETTIVI
Il vostro supporto è funzionale a:
- realizzare le riprese
- completare i lavori di post-produzione: montaggio, sound design, color correction
- esposizione finale: noleggio service e allestimento
CIO’ CHE DAI E’ TUO PER SEMPRE, ciò che non dai è perso per sempre. Noi cercheremo, in un rituale del corteggiamento di sedurvi con il nostro progetto, proprio come un innamorato cerca di conquistare la ragazza dei suoi sogni, offrendole, in un crescendo di coinvolgimento e pathos, una serie di doni.Per ""sedurvi"" ancora di più abbiamo deciso di prendervi per la gola. Vi offriremo infatti, nel caso in cui vogliate omaggiarci di un anello di fidanzamento (500 €) o addirittura portarci all'altare (3000 €), un BRUNCH o una CENA presso il KITCHEN ristorante di Milano dove il vero protagonista è il cibo. Pochi tavoli in un ambiente intimo e rilassante. I migliori piatti della tradizione italiana, anche in chiave ""gluten free"" che si evolvono nel corso delle stagioni. Due orti che ne garantiscono la freschezza. La buona cucina senza compromessi. Una proposta che non potrete proprio rifiutare!
SI PUO' DARE DI PIU'
Siamo convinti che l'amore sia il ""virus"" più contagioso al mondo, quindi, se non potete sostenerci economicamente, innamoratevi del nostro progetto:
- fateci arrivare migliaia di LIKE
- postate questo messaggio d'amore sui tutti social che conoscete
- riempite la nostra casella di posta del cuore
- attaccatevi alla cornetta e parlate a tutti del nostro progetto PASSO A DUE project:Passo a due is a project born from the collaboration
between Elena Bellantoni and Mariana Ferratto. The two artists have been
invited at the prestigious space for Contemporary Art Careof DOCVA in Milan for
an artistic residency during the month of May 2014, and decided to develop a
project in parallel as result of a comparison between their works.
Elena and Mariana have developed over the years
some artistic projects with similar themes related to the concept of identity
and relationship. Passo a due aims to analyse the concept of power within the relationship. They decided to
confront this issue and develop two video works that investigate this
relational topic. 
The starting points of Bellantoni and Ferratto
were two of their previous work, specifically Ich bin du bist ... (Bellantoni
2010) and Ciao (Ferratto 2011). CAMPAIGN
The Crowdfunding Campaign aims to support the
Young Italian Art for the realization of two works of art. The support is
fundamental to the creation of art, either conceptually and in practice. 
Supporters will be able to get involved with the
artists during the creation process of the works. The dynamics of sharing is a
substantial part of the creative process by directly invoking the concept: the
RELATIONSHIP. 
The Artistic residency will end with the
presentation of the work, where the relational and participatory processes
triggered by the Passo a due campaign will be evident, too.OBJECTIVES 
Your support is functional: 
- Carry out the shooting 
- Complete the work on post-production:
editing, sound design, color correction 
- 
Exhibition, rental service and equipments
We will try, as in a ritual of courtship to
seduce you with our project, and such as a lover tries to win the girl of his
dreams,  will offer you a series of
gifts. 
To ""seduce"" even more we decided to
take you by the throat. In case you want to engage us with ring (500 €) or even lead to the
altar (3000 €), we will express our gratitude with a BRUNCH or DINNER at
KITCHEN restaurant in Milan, where food is the absolute protagonist! A few
tables in an intimate and relaxing atmosphere where you can taste the best
dishes of the Italian tradition. Two vegetables gardens guarantee only fresh

<li>My name is Louise Lowe. I'm a 25 year old Liverpool born photographer, and have been working professionally in the fields of Portrait, Fashion, Editorial, Music and PR for the last 7 years.  </li>
<li>I started my project last year, wanting to photograph the unique characters I saw each day on the streets of Liverpool and hold a small exhibition showcasing the diverse identity of this city. The project became very popular, very quickly and I decided to continue it for one whole year, curious to see how many people I could photograph throughout this time.<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> </span>
</li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The project vastly took hold when I created an interactive public event for Liverpool Light Night 2013, and had over 300 people attend the event to be photographed.</span></li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">More and more people have wanted to be involved, and the turn out to each of the public open sessions has been incredible. </span><br/>
</li>

<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Not only is this my first exhibition as an artist and photographer but I believe I have created a project that has brought together a community and also shows the identity of a city via the people who live here. I feel it is important for this collection to reach it's goal not only for myself and those featured and involved but also for the Liverpool public to see who they are and feel a part of something bigger.        </span><br/>
</li>
<li>As well as Camp and Furnace, kindly donating ""The Gold Room"" to the project, Liverpool Light Night 14 are featuring it as a must-see exhibition in this year's celebration of art in the city.    </li>
</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><ul>
<li>I need to raise £6,800 in the next 6 weeks. The majority of the funding is to cover the cost of printing the art work itself, and then the rest of the money is to go towards building the exhibition including lighting, marketing and advertising, promoting the event via posters and flyers and the distribution costs this entails, in order to reach as many people as possible.        </li>
<li>There are many amazing rewards for your pledges. From Postcards, Prints, Books and even your own Photo Session to commemorate this epic project coming to fruition, to also Personal, Editorial &amp; Commercial High End Photographic and Video Sessions if you would prefer something a bit different and tailored more to your liking. I want you to feel involved in this project as well as get the most out of your rewards.    </li>
<li>If I don't reach my target, I have already discussed plans with the art printers to down scale the size of the exhibition. This would mean many people would not be included and it would be such a sorry waste of the hundreds of photographs that would not get to be seen that all help in creating the bigger picture.</li>
<li>Any further funds over my target will only lead to a bigger and better exhibition, with the possibility of the full collection being turned in to a beautiful coffee table book so the exhibition will live on once it is over.     </li>
</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><ul>
<li>This project has a chance to show the world who one city is. The people that walk its streets, which flow through its veins, the passion and creativity that keeps the heart of the city beating, the brilliant minds that keep it moving forward. Each indiviual creates its identity and these are the people you will meet in the train stations, shops, cafes, restaurants and bars, who will be at the gigs, festivals and events, and they are all important to its make up. </li>
<li>Liverpool has a vast history of being negatively stereotyped and it's time to put these stereotypes to rest in this positive celebration.  </li>
<li>This is the first large scale project I have undertaken, and so far it has been more than successful in creating itself. The interest and support it has received has been overwhelming and shows this project is already worth a lot to so many people.</li>
<li>There is nothing stopping this project building on itself and doing something nation wide. Community is about including everyone and Liverpool is only a smaller community inside a much greater one. If there has been such a huge response from just one city, then I am sure there is something to be said for the rest of the British Isles.     </li>

<div>     Hello, my name is Evan Siegel and I
would love your help to complete a public art project.  I have been honored to be chosen as one of 8
artists commissioned to create a public art piece that will serve to liven up a
streetscape in Greeley, Colorado.  In my excitement to design a
piece that would appeal to the public art committee, I made errors in my
estimation of the costs to fabricate the work.  I will receive $10,000 from the City of Greeley<span> as
part of the commission, however the total costs of the project, as outlined
below, will greatly exceed that.  I am
prepared to cover the overage, if needed, and meet my obligation to the city.  I have started this campaign to reach out to art lovers for some assistance.  Please read my story below.  Any help would be much appreciated, but for a
donation of $150 or more you will get a piece of art!</span><br/>
</div>
<div>     Within the city of Greeley there is a major thoroughfare (8th Avenue) linking downtown to the University of Northern Colorado, roughly a mile to the south.  This section of the thoroughfare has a somewhat forlorn character.  The buildings that front the avenue are intermittent and not uniform, and there is sporadic commercial activity. There is a lack of rhythm and enclosure that is not welcoming.  Because of this, traffic speeds up and pedestrians avoid the area.<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/954331/files/20141023122321-CIMG1839.JPG?1414092201"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div>
<div>     The location of the People Tree public sculpture will be where the concrete planter (without the plant) is located, directly below the Route 85 marker in the photograph.  This is a view looking north up 8th Avenue.</div>
<div>     The city has commissioned eight artists to create sculptural trees that will be ""planted"" along the avenue.  Art will be used as a catalyst to inspire changes that will make this avenue desirable.  It will become a place to visit and a place to be.  I have been fortunate to be one of the artists selected to create a sculpture.<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">  </span>

</div></div>","""The People Tree"" is a proposal for public art, to be located in the city of Greeley, Colorado.
     Hello, my name is Evan Siegel and I
would love your help to complete a public art project.  I have been honored to be chosen as one of 8
artists commissioned to create a public art piece that will serve to liven up a
streetscape in Greeley, Colorado.  In my excitement to design a
piece that would appeal to the public art committee, I made errors in my
estimation of the costs to fabricate the work.  I will receive $10,000 from the City of Greeley as
part of the commission, however the total costs of the project, as outlined
below, will greatly exceed that.  I am
prepared to cover the overage, if needed, and meet my obligation to the city.  I have started this campaign to reach out to art lovers for some assistance.  Please read my story below.  Any help would be much appreciated, but for a
donation of $150 or more you will get a piece of art!

     Within the city of Greeley there is a major thoroughfare (8th Avenue) linking downtown to the University of Northern Colorado, roughly a mile to the south.  This section of the thoroughfare has a somewhat forlorn character.  The buildings that front the avenue are intermittent and not uniform, and there is sporadic commercial activity. There is a lack of rhythm and enclosure that is not welcoming.  Because of this, traffic speeds up and pedestrians avoid the area.

     The location of the People Tree public sculpture will be where the concrete planter (without the plant) is located, directly below the Route 85 marker in the photograph.  This is a view looking north up 8th Avenue.
     The city has commissioned eight artists to create sculptural trees that will be ""planted"" along the avenue.  Art will be used as a catalyst to inspire changes that will make this avenue desirable.  It will become a place to visit and a place to be.  I have been fortunate to be one of the artists selected to create a sculpture.  


                                        The design I have developed consists of a tree-like form fabricated from steel. Attached to the ""branches"" of this tree are 13 circular galvanized steel ""medallions"". Both sides of these medallions will feature portraits of citizens of Greeley who have volunteered to be photographed so that their portraits may be included in this public art.   The premise for the ""People Tree"" is that people will be intrigued to visit a work of art that features images of their neighbors, their friends, and themselves.                                             Essentially: People attract people.      


     The images on the medallions are rendered in black and white acrylic paints and sealed with a satin varnish.  Prior to painting, a metal primer is applied to the galvanized steel.  The portraits will also be photographed prior to installation. Precautions are being taken to ensure that the paintings endure.  
     After being awarded the commission, a colleague was hired to translate my freehand drawings into a digital AUTOcad file.  This file was then submitted to a structural engineer who sized the steel and reviewed the connection details.


     The impetus for this Indiegogo campaign is simply that I have erred.  When the City of Greeley announced the call for submittals they were very specific in defining the scope and allocating an available budget of $10,000 per artist.  As I developed my design I referred to some exterior metal signage I had recently designed and installed.  I made some working assumptions, such as; If the sign pictured (below) cost 'X', then the design proposed for Greeley (above)  might cost 'Y'...                                     


     After receiving the commission I submitted the engineered drawing along with photographs of the maquette to three prospective fabricators.  It became quite clear that the cost to fabricate the proposal would far exceed the allocated budget of $10,000.  

     The photograph above shows this sculpture in late October.  The steel fabrication is primarily completed.  
     The final budget for fabrication is now approximately $18,000.  This does not include the (already paid) expenses for photography, engineering, and travel; as well as an artist's fee (my design fee).  My estimation is that final costs for all aspects of this work, including documentation and artist's fee, will approach $30,000.  The City of Greeley has agreed to a $10,000 fee.  As a consequence, there will be $20,000 of debt.

<p>     Hello! My name is Andy Herod. I am an artist/musician living in Asheville NC. Recently through the help of some west coast friends and supporters of my art, I was offered a solo show at a gallery in Los Angeles.

I'm 100% DIY these days, but sometimes DIY also means asking for help. The cost so far of just making this show has been huge to me, because I want it to be awesome.

Smash the fash. It's what our beloved Masked Hero was built upon.
Show the world you won't put up with fascism with these Henshin Hero inspired enamel pins.Each 38 mm pin is made with Black Dye soft enamal for striking black outlines on the artwork, easily readable without glare from your jacket of choice. Each perk comes with a vinyl sticker of whichever pins you receive.

Maybe you've seen something similar before?
In 2019 I produced an initial run of pins featuring designs like these.
This time around I wanted a slight redesign that looked a little slicker than their previous counterparts.
 

Line Up
 
 This campaign is pretty straight forward, it's a preorder system for this run of pins. The goal is the amount I would need to produce a decent amount all pins in the set. Should this campaign pass its initial goal I'll start adding extra pins for backers, including an oversized pin with all 3 Riders. Stretch Goals When preorders for the Kicks pins reach £800 I'll be adding a mini pin to everyone's order.This pin will be around 20mmThe 3 rider pin, rather than being enamel due to the extra details will be a printed pin on a metal backing with a clear epoxy coating, 40mm in size.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Riddle Farm Glass is a glassblowing studio that was started in 2007.  We use glass mined locally to create beautiful pieces of art which bring functionality and joy into people's lives. We produce glass products ranging from small jewelry items to large glass vessels, ceremonial art, and ornamental pieces. </p>
<p>We've created this campaign to raise the necessary funds to rebuild our glass furnace, a new kiln and ventilation system. In renewing this enterprise, the expanded studio will enable us to reach deeper into the community, providing education and hands-on studio experience to local artists.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3><strong>Vision</strong></h3>
<p>My name is Kristen Marie Munoz. I began blowing glass in Austin, TX thirteen years ago, using a torch and borosilicate glass. I moved to Western North Carolina shortly after to attend the Penland School of Crafts. There I practiced with and learned from Emilio Santini, Thurman Stattum, and Alan Fine among others. I attended sessions at Penland for eight straight years before I helped build my own studio in Marshall, NC in 2007.</p>
<p>Riddle Farm Glass is an environmentally and socially conscious business. I use local glass mined within 40 minutes of our studio. Nearby Spruce Pine, North Carolina is known to have some of the purest quartz in the world and their quality of glass is very high. Along with Spruce Pine Batch Glass, I use different minerals and metals to infuse unique designs and patterns in my glass art. My work includes giving back to the earth by having trees planted with each customer purchase while raising awareness of environmental issues.</p>
<p>Glass blowing as an art and small enterprise has been gradually dying over recent decades due to the high costs associated with operating a traditional studio. Therefore we are committed to raising awareness about glass blowing as an accessible artfom by opening our doors to tours, small group demonstrations, classes and individualized instruction.</p>
<p>Along with making functional art which brings joy into people's lives, we create custom ceremonial glass for people of all faiths and traditions to incorporate into their spiritual practice.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</span></strong></p>
<p>The furnace I helped to build in 2007 now has a cracked crucible. It needs to be taken apart and completely rebuilt. The materials needed to operate efficiently under temperatures in excess of 2,000 degrees fahrenheit are expensive. We discovered in 2007 that the cost to build the furnace ourselves was drastically lower than purchasing a new unit.</p>
<p>I am so excited that you want to support the new vision of Riddle Farm Glass! Feel free to contact me if you have a special request that is not covered in these options:</p>

Therefore we are committed to raising awareness about glass blowing as an accessible artfom by opening our doors to tours, small group demonstrations, classes and individualized instruction.
Along with making functional art which brings joy into people's lives, we create custom ceremonial glass for people of all faiths and traditions to incorporate into their spiritual practice.
What We Need & What You Get
The furnace I helped to build in 2007 now has a cracked crucible. It needs to be taken apart and completely rebuilt. The materials needed to operate efficiently under temperatures in excess of 2,000 degrees fahrenheit are expensive. We discovered in 2007 that the cost to build the furnace ourselves was drastically lower than purchasing a new unit.

Hi.  My name is Michael Tullberg, and I’m one of the 
longest-running electronic music photojournalists in North America.  
During the 1990s and 2000s, I was writing and photographing for most of 
the major dance music magazines in this country, covering the hottest 
and most controversial music scene in the land: the rave scene. That’s
 right, the rave underground.  The secret dance music network.  The 
parties that were so intense,  they became instant classics as their 
growing legions of fans raved happily well into the morning on a regular
 basis. And now you can go back to those heady and fantastic days by contributing to fund my new book, DANCEFLOOR THUNDERSTORM: Land Of The Free, Home Of The Rave.Electric Daisy Carnival, 2001DANCEFLOOR THUNDERSTORM: Land Of The Free, Home Of The Rave is 
about the glory days of the American rave scene as it exploded 
nationwide like wildfire.  It's a photo-heavy book that contains 
hundreds of my very best images from the formative years of epic parties
 like Electric Daisy Carnival, Nocturnal Wonderland, Dune and 
others.  It gives you VIP access to legendary electronic music artists like Paul Oakenfold, 
Moby, Fatboy Slim, Carl Cox, Richie Hawtin, the Chemical Brothers and 
more. The author Michael Tullberg and the one and only Carl Cox, 2000 or so.DANCEFLOOR THUNDERSTORM will take you back to the warehouses, 
deserts, mountains, beaches and clubs where rhythmic magic was
 made. In other words, it's a rave hot tub time machine.  And, this campaign is the ONLY way that 
you can reserve your copy ahead of publication.  So pre-order with a donation today!Richie Hawtin, L.A., 1999Dune 4 desert rave, 1998And here's some more from Frankie!“Michael
Tullberg is a long time photographer of the west coast scene. He has been
trying to fund his book project for some time now and I think anyone who truly
loves this culture should help this guy out to live his dream. Unrelated to

going to be the first photo book of its kind in the U.S that presents the 
visual record of a crucial era in American pop culture.  The first to 
show what raving was really like, from the point of view of those who 
were actually there, as opposed to the outside academics and press who could never fully (or accurately) describe what was really going on.

Chilean muralist Francisco Letelier will collaborate with the community in the

STRUGGLE COMMITTEE OF BILI'N INVITES IMAGINACTION FOR TWO WEEKS OF CULTURAL
ACTIVISM THIS OCTOBER.  My name is Hector Aristizabal and I am the
Founder/Director of ImaginAction.  I am alive today because of countless
acts of solidarity by both friends and total strangers. With their
support, I survived. I lived to tell my story. 

By sharing my
experiences of political imprisonment, torture and creative struggle, I have
learned that story is the biggest freedom fighter. It communicates our truth. It
resists the oppressive narratives that others try to impose upon us.  Story
makes meaning when things seem not to make sense. It sees our wounds. It heals
our hearts.  It re-weaves community. Story creates POWER.
That's why I
founded the organization ImaginAction. For more than a decade, we've traveled
the world, working alongside others who wish to tell their own rich stories of
struggle and hope.
Now we have been
invited to occupied Palestine by the Popular Struggle Committee in Bili´n - the village that features in 5 Broken Cameras - and one of many Palestinian
communities engaged in ongoing struggle against Israel’s ongoing practice of
settler colonialism, military occupation and structural apartheid.   We feel honored to join with this
community for two weeks of activism and cultural exchange. 
During our time
together, we will share our expertise in using theater for social justice.
Using Augusto Boal's Theater of the Oppressed we'll help create a Forum
Theater play drawn from the real-life experiences of the people of Bili´n and
we'll carry performances to neighboring villages (Nabi Saleh, Nili'n and
Budrus). We'll organize a street theater event including spectacular giant
puppets to participate in the weekly demonstration against the occupation.
Chilean muralist Francisco Letelier will collaborate with the community in the
creation of a mural depicting the story of Bili'n's struggle for dignity and
freedom. We'll join with local and international artists at the end of our stay in
a cultural exchange of music and theater to celebrate the Olive Harvest.
As we have done in
our work in Colombia, Northern Ireland, and China, we have invited a select
group of international theater practitioners to work with us in order to
learn from the experience and from each other about the use of theater for
community transformation. 
If you can't join
us in Bili´n, you can still be part of the story. Your contribution will help
make our work possible.  THE IMPACT OF YOUR DONATION For many years
ImaginAction has been developing different ways of using Theater of the
Oppressed and other methodologies to collaborate with political and social
activists, community and youth organizers, educators and therapists around the
globe as a way of engaging social problems, activating communities, and
experimenting with new social and political possibilities. Your donation will
help ImaginAction´s team and up to 20 Palestinian artists  to come
together and learn from each other as we use theater as a way of political
resistance and healing. 
 WHAT WE NEED We
will need $12,000 USD that will pay for the following items:
1. We wish to provide full scholarships to at least 20 local Palestinian artists from neighboring villages. These are theater practitioners and community organizers who have already expressed their interest in participating in the internship as well as all the events programmed during the 14 days of the residency.  Most of these artists are people we have worked with during past visits to Palestine or who have been part of The Freedom Bus organized by Ben Rivers and The Freedom Theater from Jenin.  Each scholarship includes travel costs from their villages to Bili´n, plus food and lodging for the 14 days. Some of these artists will also perform their plays during the 5-day olive harvest festival at the end of the residency.  None of the Palestinian artists will pay any fees for the Forum Theater training offered by Hector Aristizabal and Alessia Cartoni. We have calculated 13,000 Shekels or $4,000 dollars to be able to cover these costs.2.  International flight for Muralist Francisco Letelier ($1,400) plus materials ($500) that will be used for the creation of a mural depicting the many years of the Bili´n struggle against the Israeli occupation.  Francisco will be working virtually with the community in the concept design of the mural prior to his arrival. 
3.  International flight  (approximately $1,400 ) for Ken Srdjak, puppetista extraordinaire who will travel to Bili'n two weeks prior to the arrival of the rest of the group of Internationals. Ken will bring materials ($600) and a specific plan to teach how to build giant puppets. During his workshop several giant puppets will be made with the community of Bili´n.  These puppets will be used both in the weekly demonstration against the occupation and the forum theater play that will be developed and performed at the end of our residency. 
4.  We will pay
local organizer Fidaa Ataya ($3,000) for her work
with the logistics during the preparation and implementation of several aspects
of this residency. i.e. Coordinating travel arrangements to and from airports
in Amman and Tel Aviv. Transportation inside the West Bank as we will travel to
three local villages, coordinating food and lodging (for up to 10 international
and 20 Palestinian artists) coordinating appropriate places for the theater of
the oppressed workshops, the puppet making as well as the creation of the
mural. Finally she will coordinate the 5 day Festival to celebrate the olive
harvest including performances of both International and local Palestinian
theater and music groups as well as the Forum Theater piece that we will
develop during the residency. 
5.  Alessia and
Hector will cover our costs with the contributions of the International
interns.  So none of the indiegogo campaign will pay us or cover our
expenses. If the campaign raises more than the $12,000 requested, additional
funds will go in support of the organization and will be greatly appreciated.
 RISKS AND
CHALLENGES  As many of you know, gaining entry into the Occupied Palestinian Territories and Israel is not predictable.
  With Israel's most recent offensive against Gaza - where nearly 2000 Palestinians were massacred - we predict that the Israeli authorities will be
especially restrictive in who they allow into Palestine-Israel.
Our Palestinian
comrades on the ground have made it clear however, that during times
like this, it is crucial that we continue to unite in on-the-ground, joint struggle
against the racist, colonial and militaristic structures that underpin the
ongoing and brutal oppression of the Palestinian people.

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Sono Sonia Aviles. Sono anni che lavoro in difesa del
patrimonio archeologico in Bolivia, oggi ho il sostegno di una grande squadra
che volontariamente si è impegnata a preservare la Roccia sacra di Samaipata e
valorizzare il suo ambiente. Lisbet Bengtsson ha dedicato la sua vita allo
studio della pietra scolpita. Emanuela Bre' e ​​Gianni Ganzaroli si dedicano al
americanismo con grande passione e con una esperienza importante. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Il nostro concetto di conservazione è integrale, perché per
capire il ruolo sociale, simbolico, religioso e/o politico della Roccia, si
deve conoscere l'ambiente che la circonda.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">La maggior divinità lapidea degli Incas è in un processo di
degrado allarmante.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">In coordinamento con le autorità che proteggono il
monumento, insieme a Richard Alcázar, abbiamo eseguito esperimenti per
affrontare il degrado, fermarlo e ricuperare l'integritá del monumento, sia con
tecniche tradizionali utilizzate fin dalla preistoria o quelle che la
tecnologia ha sviluppato al giorno d'oggi.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Tuttavia, il nostro lavoro è poco conosciuto, come
l'ancestrale Roccia, quindi abbiamo deciso di produrre un documentario sulla sua
storia, le tecniche di conservazione e la particolare vita dell'archeologo in campo.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">In un mondo concreto in cui l'umanesimo, l'arte,
l'archeologia, sembrano non avere posto, chiediamo il vostro aiuto.</p>

</div></div>","Sono Sonia Aviles. Sono anni che lavoro in difesa del
patrimonio archeologico in Bolivia, oggi ho il sostegno di una grande squadra
che volontariamente si è impegnata a preservare la Roccia sacra di Samaipata e
valorizzare il suo ambiente. Lisbet Bengtsson ha dedicato la sua vita allo
studio della pietra scolpita. Emanuela Bre' e ​​Gianni Ganzaroli si dedicano al
americanismo con grande passione e con una esperienza importante. 
Il nostro concetto di conservazione è integrale, perché per
capire il ruolo sociale, simbolico, religioso e/o politico della Roccia, si
deve conoscere l'ambiente che la circonda.
La maggior divinità lapidea degli Incas è in un processo di
degrado allarmante.
In coordinamento con le autorità che proteggono il
monumento, insieme a Richard Alcázar, abbiamo eseguito esperimenti per
affrontare il degrado, fermarlo e ricuperare l'integritá del monumento, sia con
tecniche tradizionali utilizzate fin dalla preistoria o quelle che la
tecnologia ha sviluppato al giorno d'oggi.
Tuttavia, il nostro lavoro è poco conosciuto, come
l'ancestrale Roccia, quindi abbiamo deciso di produrre un documentario sulla sua
storia, le tecniche di conservazione e la particolare vita dell'archeologo in campo.
In un mondo concreto in cui l'umanesimo, l'arte,
l'archeologia, sembrano non avere posto, chiediamo il vostro aiuto.
Io non mi arrendo, si può fare.

En coordinación con las autoridades que tutelan el
monumento, junto a Richard Alcázar, hemos realizado experimentaciones a fin de
afrontar el deterioro. Buscamos pararlo y revertirlo, ya sea con las técnicas
tradicionales usadas desde la prehistoria o aquellas que la tecnología ha
desarrollado en la actualidad.
Sin embargo, nuestro trabajo es poco conocido, al igual que
la ancestral Roca, por ello, hemos decidido elaborar un documental sobre su
historia, las técnicas de conservación y la peculiar vida del arqueólogo en
campo.
En un mundo práctico dónde el humanismo, el arte, la arqueología,
parecen no tener lugar, pedimos tu ayuda.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>In December 2018 I received an UGEE tablet. Everything was great, at first! It then started showing problems, the most notable being that the pen cursor would constantly jump and miss out a bit of the screen, consequently screwing up the calibration. My laptop is quite old and crummy, so I assumed it was that, or the drivers, and that it would remain fixed for a while - or perhaps the 8th time in which I had reinstalled the driver.</p>
<p>The tablet itself was a Christmas gift from my parents, it was agreed that the amount it cost (£300) would have to be paid back later. After trying everything, I haven't been able to solve the issue, so it could only be the fault of the hardware. I've emailed UGEE and tried to get in contact with them (multiple times, to no avail) and even if I eventually do, they will likely point out that the one year warranty has passed.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><i>What do we do now, now that we are happy?</i> is an exhibition and performance event, opening on 1 February at Chalton gallery in London.</p>
<p>The group show presents new art works by five international artists, all currently based in London. The project questions how happiness is presented and used as a commodity in our society. Through sculptures, video installations and performances, the exhibition confronts us with this individual pressure to be perfectly happy contrasted with a universal feeling of disappointment and anxiety when the happiness that we long for is never reached.</p>
<p>The publication, accompanying the exhibition, takes its format from health and wellbeing magazines. It contains writings on the exhibition and presented artworks, advertisements, horoscopes, recipes etc. commissioned from the artists and produced by the public in the Chisenhale Studios workshop in August 2018.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>What do we do now, now that we are happy? is well underway at this point, but we need your help to make sure we can fully realize the project. To that end, we're asking you to help us raise £700.</p>
<p>We've been fortunate to receive £700 from Goldsmiths Alumni and Friends Fund, but we need some additional support to make sure we can cover our costs. Your Indiegogo contribution allows us to supply materials for the new commissions, pay artists, and fund the publication of the magazine.</p>

<h3>Let me sum up...</h3>
<p>Hi. I'm James 'Grim' Desborough, owner of Postmortem Studios. We're an independent RPG game and fiction publisher with a large portfolio of genre stock art. I've been working in the RPG industry for nearly 20 years and have worked with a lot of great artists and publishers.</p>
<p>For many years I worked with a young, promising artists known as 'DarkZel', until he was tragically killed in an accident. In his memory I have run a scholarship fund for several years as a competition, helping out young or struggling artists with money for supplies or just to help them through school. I want to help them in the same way I helped Zel.</p>
<p>This year we're doing something a little different. My ill health will not allow me to run a full crowdfunder and competition as I have in the past, and it has also become apparent that we do not have a large enough stockpile of stock art - yet - to make the scholarship self sustaining. To that end, this year, I intend to solicit donated art and to use the money raised here to commission art pieces from young and struggling artists, all of which will be sold as stock art to help the viability of the scholarship long term.</p>
<p>By helping here, you'll be contributing to aid for young artists for years to come.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>The money raised from the last year's sales of the scholarship stock art will be combined with whatever is raised here to commission pieces from young and struggling artists. $500 will allow us to commission a number of pieces which will then be sold on sites like RPGNOW into the games design and writing community.</p>
<p>'Exposure' has a bad rap when it comes to creative work - I'm writer, believe me, I know - but artists who donate art or get commissioned will get exposure to a large, potential pool of clients and their contact information will be disseminated to anyone who buys their art. I will also promote them on my blogs, social media and Youtube channels. Those commissioned will, of course, also be paid!<br/><br/>If we don't reach the full goal, whatever amount is raised will go on commissioning art.

<h3>What is it about?</h3>
<p>My name is Alexander Smith. I'm an artist who has been working professionaly now since more then 7 years. Although my work has been shown in different parts of the world and has been described as a marvelous blend of western painting technique with the influence of Japanese art, it still is a tough battle to get things done. </p>
<p>This campaine is not a major idea that needs to be sponsored. It is, actually a rather small thing but with significant importance to me and my carrier as an artist. To be able to sell, to recieve commissions and te be invited for shows, you have to build a name. a simple and effective way to do this is to be mentioned in a professional art guide. This particalur guide has already a renowed name for reaching a wide spread public. A public which has its interest in art and always likes to see new entries. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get </h3>
<p>A fixed fee needs to be paid in order to have my work being represented in this art guide. The fee consist out of ordering 20 copies of the art guide + a extra fee for having a double page publication. Also there is a small amount needed for having someone writing a professional shot story about me and my work. Although I'm good with a brush, I come short when it come to words. <br/>All together it comes down to the following:</p>
<p>- basic fee consisting out of 20 copies á 10,60 euro makes: 212,00 euro</p>
<p>- extra fee for double page publication: 106,00 euro</p>
<p>- having a short story written by professional: around 150,00 euro</p>
<p>Al together it becomes around 468,00 euro (not 19% tax included) this brings it down to up and around $ 700,00. </p>
<p>Now, if you are that sweet person that is going to help me out, what is it that you can expect? First of all you will be updated with all the activities arond this art guide publication. You will receive standard a personal thank you and as perks you might be mentioned on my website, get an invitation, receive a copy of the actual art guide or become a owner of a unique handmade zen ink drawing on handpressed paper. </p>
<p>In case I do not reach my goal of $ 700,00 the funds will still be used for my representation in the art guide.  </p>
<p>Of course it would be great if you could contribute to this fund but I understand very well that some of you just don't have the means for it. nevertheless I would like to ask you to spread the word for my cause. You can use the special Indiegogo share tools on this page!!</p>

<p>Hi! I’m Ann Moeller Steverson. I am a contemporary figurative painter native to Huntsville, Alabama. I love painting people and beautiful objects.</p>
<p>OPEN is my new series of contemporary realist paintings, which will explore the beauty of letting go.</p>
<p>I am creating this new body of work for a solo show opening in February 2019 at the Little Green Store in Huntsville, Alabama. Through this Indiegogo fund, you have the opportunity to pre-purchase work (in exclusive and first-choice formats) that will be created for the show and have an inside view of its creation.</p>
<p>Since the very first time I was asked to create an artist statement, I’ve struggled over what to say other than, “I just really want to make beautiful paintings.” This is still the truest statement about why I make my work, but I’ve come to the realization that the beauty in what any of us has to offer is the most authentic parts of ourselves. That is what I want to give. My pieces are always a reflection of where I am personally and are continually changing with me.</p>
<p>This past year, I’ve been going through a period of dramatic change and transition in my life, throughout which I’ve been intentionally practicing the art of letting go. This has included releasing expectations, letting go of resistance, and my best attempts at sharing the most open, authentic version of myself. I am finding that this process lets in peace, love, joy, and intense beauty.</p>
<p>For my next body of work, I will integrate this personal inspiration with specific design ideas that I have in mind. I will explore visual concepts of movement, light and dark patterns, and cool light softly falling across beautiful scenes. I want to construct abstractly well-designed pieces while sharing what I find intensely beautiful and peaceful. My hope is that through this work, you can experience openness, joy, and peace.  </p>
<p>For the creation of this work, I will be collecting orchids in whites and purples, soft green moss, and taxidermic doves. I will also be hiring models so that I can continue to explore human connections and the universal experiences that we have.</p>
<p>I want to invite you to join me on this journey. Every level of collector now has the opportunity to pre-purchase a piece from my new body of work, thereby helping to fund its creation. I am creating prints exclusively for my Indiegogo supporters. I have not created prints in several years, and no other prints from this body of work will be created or sold. I hope this option provides an opportunity for those who love my work but are not able to afford my original pieces to have something of mine in their homes. Your purchase will help provide me with the resources to explore the inspiration that is calling me to this project.</p>
<p><strong>Muse -</strong> <strong>$2,000: </strong>First choice of one <strong>original</strong> painting from <i>OPEN</i>, up to 12”x16”</p>
<p><strong>Patron - $75: </strong>A signed and framed, highly limited edition 8”x10” giclée print, including a weekly progress report</p>
<p><strong>Sponsor - $45:</strong> A signed, unframed, highly limited edition 8”x10” giclée print, including a weekly progress report.</p>
<p>Even if you can't make a pre-purchase today, you can still be a part of the project. Join the journey as a supporter for a budget-friendly $5 and receive weekly email updates from the studio. Or simply share the love by using the Indiegogo share to invite your art lover friends and help spread the word about OPEN.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><u>Project Budget</u></strong></p>

<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>TOTAL:</strong>                                     <strong>$1,000</strong></p>
<p>If I don’t reach this entire goal, I’ll use the available funds to gather what I can and then do what artists do best: get creative. Funds that exceed this budget will be used for art materials and framing expenses for the show, so your generous support is greatly appreciated.  </p>
<p>With faith, gratitude and love,</p>

If I don’t reach this entire goal, I’ll use the available funds to gather what I can and then do what artists do best: get creative. Funds that exceed this budget will be used for art materials and framing expenses for the show, so your generous support is greatly appreciated.

<em><br/></em><strong>WANDERER OF YAWNDER - FUNDRAISING CAMPAIGN<br/></strong>
</h2>
<p><em>“While <em>the ponderers ponder</em>, and the wonderers wonder,</em><br/><em><em>the wanderers wander</em>, and the plunderers plunder.”</em> - Jiggs</p>
<p>G’day. Since 2008, I’ve been exhibiting original graphite and watercolour drawings from my series about Wanderers around the whole world. Over the past couple of winters, I’ve been honing a narrative that has been slowly emerging from my artistic practice in which I’ve produced almost 100 drawings and even won some awards. The result is my first picture book, titled <em>Wanderer of Yawnder</em>. This is the first in a series of stories from the epic narrative that has come from my ponderings about Wanderers and my learnings from Granduncle Jiggs — my Foredad, mentor and provider of the story in this book. It's also <span class=""userContent"">the most significant art endeavor that I've undertaken. It's very scary and exciting at the same time.</span><br/><br/>With your support, I will be self-publishing a limited first run of these books, featuring 21 brand new graphite and watercolour drawings. This is also your opportunity to get one of these special artist-editions. Each one will be signed and numbered, and will include a little doodle inside, to make it extra special. There are also plenty of other perks for your contributions. I believe this book will be like something you’ve never seen. It’s a storybook for all ages to enjoy and I look forward to sharing it with yuz.</p>

<p><strong>FUNDS</strong><br/>I have set a goal for this fundraising campaign at an amount that would cover costs associated with printing, binding and shipping a limited run of books as well as fulfilling some of the perks. It's an expensive endeavor printing books so, as a first time author, it's great to know that there are people out there who'd want one. If I go beyond my goal, then I will be able to print more books. If I <em>really</em> go above and beyond my goal, like say I double it, I will be able to do a fancier print job with linen cover and foil stamping. Wouldn't that be nice!</p>

<p><strong>ABOUT THE BOOK</strong><br/><em><em><em>Wanderer of Yawnder</em></em></em> follows Jiggs as he wanders Elsewheres parts, searching for inspiration, when he finds a source over Yawnder. He soon learns about the Foredad clouds; whispering and yawning geists and zeitgeists in the winds. The book focuses on Jiggs’ personal experiences discovering the Elsewheres Lights and getting himself up there by building the tallest of ladders in order to procure a geist and proclaim his first invention: Magical Mystery Beards. When others happen upon this source, he finds his invention wasn't so inventive after all and he must dig deeper in order to create something truly original.</p>
<p>The story is based on the series of graphite and watercolour drawings that I have been exhibiting over the past few years which purports to elucidate epiphanic experiences through whimsical compositions. They reference hiking, fishing, agriculture and forebears in an attempt to create a timeless yet palpable perspective on the nature of inspiration, creation and originality. Contemporary cultural trends, where ideas can be broadcast instantly to a wide audience and recorded in the ‘cloud,’ also manifest themselves in this story.</p>

It will be an 8"" x 10"" giclee print (meaning digitally printed with archival inks) on high quality bamboo paper.</p>
<p><strong>Bookmark Set:</strong> I will also be doing a new set of 4 bookmarks especially for this campaign (those who are familiar with my exhibitions know how I love to give out bookmarks). Each one will feature artwork from the book.</p>

<p><strong>Xmas Print &amp; Greeting Cards:</strong> At the $150 Xplorer level, you can get one of my <em>12 Days of Climate Change Xmas</em> limited edition prints, which are valued at $150, plus I’ll throw a full set of <em>12 Days of Climate Change Xmas</em> <a href=""http://www.thedart.ca/index.php/prints/xmas-cards/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">greeting cards</a> (set of 12) and you get a copy of the book too.  <br/><br/><strong>Commissions:</strong> The commissions are the best deal of all though, really, cuz you’ll be able to request whatever you want, and those are good prices for my drawings at those sizes. Plus you get the book and other goodies. Although I am open to different requests, my intention for the commissioned pieces is to do a Wanderer-related drawing, such as a portrait of you or someone ye know with a magical mystery beard. I am also open to recreating pieces similar to ones that I have done over the past few years with your input. Futherer, for 8” x 10” commissions, I can do individual portraits or slightly less involved compositions. If you would like a group portrait or a complex composition, please consider the larger commissions. Shanks.</p>

to bring understanding, awareness, and action. As the artwork describes,
 we should not see these memories as an end, but rather a means to 
understanding how to approach the future.  </p>
<p>At this very moment, our commissioned artist is hard at work, preparing for the unveiling of this piece at our finale on <span>November 9</span>. This
 special evening of reflection will include the unveiling of our 
commissioned work of art along with narratives from survivors of 
Genocide. <br/><br/>Working largely in blown glass, 
the artist (Thompson Galetovic) saw the need for
 something different in this piece; something that evokes both the chaos
 of tragedy and the hope for life after it. He will create a multi-media sculpture that will allow the viewer
 to feel a part of the piece and of 'putting the pieces together.'

to bring understanding, awareness, and action. As the artwork describes,
 we should not see these memories as an end, but rather a means to 
understanding how to approach the future.  
At this very moment, our commissioned artist is hard at work, preparing for the unveiling of this piece at our finale on November 9. This
 special evening of reflection will include the unveiling of our 
commissioned work of art along with narratives from survivors of 
Genocide. Working largely in blown glass, 
the artist (Thompson Galetovic) saw the need for
 something different in this piece; something that evokes both the chaos
 of tragedy and the hope for life after it. He will create a multi-media sculpture that will allow the viewer
 to feel a part of the piece and of 'putting the pieces together.'

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We are a group of friends and artists in Toronto, most of us recent graduates from the Ontario College of Art and Design. We are comprised of illustrators, graphic designers, printmakers and new media creators, but we all have a love and interest in silk screen printing. We have been participants in group and solo shows in the last year, but as a collective we want to enable ourselves to reach a wider audience. If we could build a studio to produce more work for show and sale, we would be able to thrive from our art, and would be able to table at art and community events, not to mention be able to work as a for-hire silk screen studio. The idea is to build the studio for personal and collaborative projects. Thunderbird will also gives us a great opportunity to put together a new group show, and ideally we will be working on a show to be conceived and created all from our humble studio. We would like to have the studio fit, finished and furnished by the end of the summer, to buckle down for a long winter of printing!<br/></p>

Help NYC be a part of the largest coordinated burn in Burning Man history!

The CORE Effigy Burn



The CORE (Circle of Regional Effigies) project invites Burning Man communities from around the world to submit effigies representative of their culture to be placed in a circle around the Man. This highly ambitious undertaking will culminate in the simultaneous burning of 24 pieces: the largest coordinated burn in the event’s 25-year history.

The Tree of Heaven

The Tree of Heaven is the greater NYC community's contribution to the CORE effigy burn. It consists of a luminous subway map that appears to be embedded in the Playa floor, glowing with the vibrant energy of the city that never sleeps. 
From the center of the map a tree pushes its way towards the light, as if busting up through a crack in the cement. A captivating mash-up of organic tree-shapes and steel, concrete and chain-link textures, it erupts in thousands of leaves that are customized by the entire New York City area Burning Man community to reflect our brilliant diversity.
Benches, each owned and designed by a different New York City area Burning Man artist or collective, surround the piece, offering participants an opportunity to relax and reflect on their relationships to NYC, BRC and the growing, changing world around them. At each bench, sound artist Douglas Hart will create a different installation that reflects the sounds of the city.

The Impact

The Tree of Heaven offers NYC-area Burners to collaborate on an art project that represents our community.

Pino from Slovenia. I am currently studying at University of design. I have
been a tattoo artist for more than 6 years. I have got two great passions in my
life; art and tattoo. I worked in two professional tattoo shops and gathered
many experience, working with costumers and art. I thing a long road still lays
in front of me in which I think the next step is to open my own tattoo shop.
You can take a look at my artwork and sketches on Instagram @pinosavnik.</p><span></span><p></p>
<p><span></span></p><p><span>My name is Rok Polanc, I am 24 years old. Since I remember, art
especially drawing was my greatest passion. From my perspective tattoo is a
fascinating way to express art and I have always admired and respected people
who carry this extraordinary art on their bodies. That and Pino Savnik, who
inspired me and gave me this opportunity, are two main reasons why I have this

Studio will not only be a place, where you can get tattooed, but also a gallery and a place where each can find inspiration. It is going to be a friendly and classy shop, where people will be able to hang out and meet new friends.  The shop will be a custom tattoo shop so there will be no flash designs, everything will be unique and designed just for the costumer.  
Who are we?
Hey! I am
Pino from Slovenia. I am currently studying at University of design. I have
been a tattoo artist for more than 6 years. I have got two great passions in my
life; art and tattoo. I worked in two professional tattoo shops and gathered
many experience, working with costumers and art. I thing a long road still lays
in front of me in which I think the next step is to open my own tattoo shop.
You can take a look at my artwork and sketches on Instagram @pinosavnik.
My name is Rok Polanc, I am 24 years old. Since I remember, art
especially drawing was my greatest passion. From my perspective tattoo is a
fascinating way to express art and I have always admired and respected people
who carry this extraordinary art on their bodies. That and Pino Savnik, who
inspired me and gave me this opportunity, are two main reasons why I have this
big wish to work as tattoo artist and express myself through art of tattoo.
There is nothing better than to make living of your biggest passion.
Lets make it happen


Brown & Black is
     simple in nature, but multifaceted in concept and is going to be so much
     more than a place to get inked.  It will be an
     all-in-one creative studio space, tattoo shop, gallery, and
     classroom.

We want to help people visualize their ideas, and breathe life into 
them. Motivation, ambition, and determination empower us. We have love, 
passion, and drive for what we do and want to be creative full time. 
The funds will also help us acquire everything we
     need to make our shop as hygienic as ti can get. We want our shop standards
     to be the best they possibly can be. 
All perks will be limited edition and are never

     still can move forward with a smaller version of our biggest dreams.

<p> Hi, I’m Colleen Wolstenholme. I want to create a <u>free 8-month studio residency</u> for emerging artists in my Hantsport, N.S. studio which is unused 8 months of the year. It is fully equipped for sculpture, ceramics and jewelry-making (metalsmithing). Accommodation will also be provided.  Meals will be the artist’s responsibility.<br/>Supporters’ donations will cover rent for accommodations and studio space plus the operating costs incurred through use of the space.  </p>
<p>Our goal is to begin this first residency shortly after our campaign’s end, so we need your contributions now to ensure a timely start for the project. </p>
<p>Your generosity now can help support this studio into the future, and help young emerging artists create futures for themselves through their work. At the end of the residency the work produced will be shown in a prearranged exhibition where it can be professionally documented adding to the residency archive and giving the selected artist high resolution images of their work to aid in applying for grants and future exhibitions.<br/></p>
<p>We have built a large well-equipped artist studio of 1,200 square feet, which we want to utilize for this residency. We don't want to waste this valuable resource but seek to use it to enrich Nova Scotia and therefore we would even like to enhance the studio's ability by adding new equipment such as a TIG welder, band-saw, etc. In addition to being of benefit to the community, through shorter term projects, and the selected artists, this project will enable us to generate enough income to cover our costs thereby ensuring the survival of the space as an artist studio and workshop. The studio is equipped with a pottery kiln, large capacity compressor, MIG welder, lost wax casting equipment, and other tools used to make sculpture, as well as table saw, drill press, well-equipped jeweler's bench, and many other tools which will provide opportunity to work in a variety of media.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/123408/files/20131009102819-studio_front.jpg?1381339699"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>One of the toughest things for newly graduated artists is to find the time and well-equipped workspace with which to produce a cohesive body of work, a necessary step on the way to becoming a professional artist.</p>
<p>Recent grads can’t afford to rent studio space and the equipment they need is very expensive.  This project will provide needed help on the road to their being able to<br/>generate income from their work. It will give new graduates the opportunity to continue the work they have begun during their university years. Without an opportunity such as this, most are forced to obtain full time employment and thereby lessen the likelihood that they will continue on the road to becoming an artist. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/123411/files/20131009103054-studio_rear__2_.jpg?1381339854"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Nova Scotia is home to one of Canada’s premiere art schools – the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design University, but the attrition rate for recent BFA graduates is very high.  This residency  will ultimately provide two of these graduates each year the opportunity to kick-start their careers.  Becoming a successful artist takes dedication and hard work from the start.</p>
<p>Residency artists will be selected from a pool of applicant submissions. The call will go out immediately after the campaign ends and be selected by a committee composed of professional artists and art professors. </p>
<p><strong>WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT YOU GET<br/></strong></p>
<p>The budget per artist is $15,000.<span>  The studio can support two residencies at a time.  $10,000 per resident for expenses: rent and other accommodation costs,  e.g., heat, electricity, internet, and other supplies and utilities, kitchen facilities, laundry facilities and other needs.  $5,000 grant for the artist to cover needs related to the residency, including art making materials and other expenses.</span></p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hola! I'm Isela, owner and creator Sac Dance Lab. Since January 2017, our studio has provided hundreds of commercial-style dance classes for dancers from around the world. We cater to college students, industry professionals and folks who just love to dance! Our instructors include NBA, NFL, collegiate and agency-represented professionals passionate about the art of dance. We're on a mission to catalyze Sacramento's dance industry by offering affordable training, advocacy and paid performance work for current and aspiring pro-dancers - while providing an encouraging place to learn for recreational dancers. We are excited to announce that we're moving to a beautiful new space to better accommodate our growth!</p>
<p>With the support of the local dance community, the studio has quickly become a hub for pro-dance training and introductory training for adults of all ages. We're proud to say that in our second year we grew sales by 80% and we hosted over 600 classes attended by over 1000 people. We welcomed several community groups to use our space, and donated performances to more than 30 non-profit organizations and community events. Today, we offer 15 public classes weekly. We are humbled by Sac Dance Lab's growth so far and couldn't have done this without every dancer that has ever set foot in our space. Thank you.</p>
<p>Though Sac Dance Lab is off to a wonderful start, the upfront costs of moving and building a new dance studio have been considerable, and easily one of our largest expenses to date. In order to keep our classes affordable and our space accessible, we are asking for $5,000 in contributions from the community.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our new space will feature twice the dance floor space, stretch area, reception, beautiful window wall, plenty of well-lit parking and a creative atmosphere! To complete our mission and make the dance studio of our dreams, we need to raise $5,000. Funds will be used toward studio build-out, including:</p>
<p>1.  Sprung Marley flooring. Our current floor is expandable, so we'll be adding to it</p>
<p>2. 40 feet of glassless mirrors, 8 feet high. Super safe and lightweight</p>
<p>3. 10-foot portable barres (3-4)</p>
<p>Your contribution would help ensure our affordable class price of $10 stays at our new location. </p>
<p>Contributions over $25 offers a Sac Dance Lab reusable bottle. In our new space, we plan to operate with the goal of eliminating all single-use materials from our space. </p>
<p><strong>Every campaign contribution of over $50 offers the following perks:</strong></p>
<p><i><strong>Silver: </strong></i> $50-$99--receive 10% off coupon for all class packages for one year.</p>
<p><i><strong>Gold:</strong></i> $100-$499--receive 20% off coupon for all class packages for one year.</p>
<p><i><strong>Platinum:</strong></i> $500 -- $999--receive 25% off coupon for all class packages for one year.</p>
<p><i><strong>Diamond:</strong></i> $1,000+ -- receive 50% off coupon for all class packages for one year.</p>
<p>Contributions of any amount under $25 for the amount of your choosing, is also acceptable.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The early years of Sac Dance Lab are critical. Though we have worked on ways to reduce expenses and grow sales, we want to be in position to continue to offer affordable training, while fairly compensating our valuable instructors.</p>
<p>Your contribution is an investment in local art. By providing access to training and hosting local performing artists, our community is more likely to sustain and flourish. We believe the vision of a live, cultured and art-filled city is shared by Sacramentans and beyond.</p>
<p>We see this as an opportunity for you to support this community in a way that is meaningful to you. Right now, there is no more effective way for you to be part of Sac Dance Lab's growth, future, and legacy.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are always risks in expanding, especially for a small business like a dance studio. But, in our last two years, we have demonstrated what we can offer this community and how committed we are to making a positive impact.</p>
<p>We understand that we've set a big goal, but we believe we will reach it. Regardless of how much we raise through this Indiegogo campaign, you can feel confident that 100% of your contribution will go toward our studio build-out.  No dollar is wasted. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand not everyone can donate financially and we totally understand that. There are a few ways you can still support our goal:</p>
</div><ul>
<li>Spread the word about our studio. It means so much to us when you bring new friends to build our community. Word of mouth is a great way for Sac Dance Lab to serve more people.</li>
<li>Consider sharing our Indiegogo campaign on social, with your co-workers, with your family, and any other way you can think of.</li>
</ul><p><strong>We have 30 Days to raise $5,000! Our campaign will begin on <u>Feb 14 </u>and end on <u>March 14</u>.</strong></p><p>If you are unfamiliar with Sac Lab Dance, or would just like to know more,  check out our classes and performances on our <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0DPqlTov0eCyX4jt8j_MgA?disable_polymer=true"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">YouTube Channel</a>, our <a href=""http://instagram.com/sacdancelab"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Instagram</a> page or at <a href=""http://sacdancelab.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">SacDanceLab.com</a>. </p></div>","Our Story

1.  Sprung Marley flooring. Our current floor is expandable, so we'll be adding to it
2. 40 feet of glassless mirrors, 8 feet high. Super safe and lightweight
3. 10-foot portable barres (3-4)
Your contribution would help ensure our affordable class price of $10 stays at our new location. 
Contributions over $25 offers a Sac Dance Lab reusable bottle. In our new space, we plan to operate with the goal of eliminating all single-use materials from our space. 
Every campaign contribution of over $50 offers the following perks:
Silver:  $50-$99--receive 10% off coupon for all class packages for one year.
Gold: $100-$499--receive 20% off coupon for all class packages for one year.
Platinum: $500 -- $999--receive 25% off coupon for all class packages for one year.
Diamond: $1,000+ -- receive 50% off coupon for all class packages for one year.
Contributions of any amount under $25 for the amount of your choosing, is also acceptable.

The Impact
The early years of Sac Dance Lab are critical. Though we have worked on ways to reduce expenses and grow sales, we want to be in position to continue to offer affordable training, while fairly compensating our valuable instructors.
Your contribution is an investment in local art. By providing access to training and hosting local performing artists, our community is more likely to sustain and flourish. We believe the vision of a live, cultured and art-filled city is shared by Sacramentans and beyond.
We see this as an opportunity for you to support this community in a way that is meaningful to you. Right now, there is no more effective way for you to be part of Sac Dance Lab's growth, future, and legacy.  

Risks & Challenges
There are always risks in expanding, especially for a small business like a dance studio. But, in our last two years, we have demonstrated what we can offer this community and how committed we are to making a positive impact.
We understand that we've set a big goal, but we believe we will reach it. Regardless of how much we raise through this Indiegogo campaign, you can feel confident that 100% of your contribution will go toward our studio build-out.  No dollar is wasted. 

Other Ways You Can Help
We understand not everyone can donate financially and we totally understand that. There are a few ways you can still support our goal:

Spread the word about our studio. It means so much to us when you bring new friends to build our community. Word of mouth is a great way for Sac Dance Lab to serve more people.
Consider sharing our Indiegogo campaign on social, with your co-workers, with your family, and any other way you can think of.
We have 30 Days to raise $5,000! Our campaign will begin on Feb 14 and end on March 14.If you are unfamiliar with Sac Lab Dance, or would just like to know more,  check out our classes and performances on our YouTube Channel, our Instagram page or at SacDanceLab.com.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Because it incorporates poetry, prose, math, music, photography, drawing and print-making. 

Because it is beautiful.

it light enough for handling during transport and installation. The clay readily
accepts glazes, which may be used to impart color to the project and enhance
the iconicity of the 1970’s Beetle. Next, I’ll build an underlying scaffolding
of wood and metal to support the clay bricks. Wooden presses will be
constructed to form the bricks by hand, and the wet bricks will be stacked to
the overall dimensions of my Volkswagen. Before drying, I’ll carve the stacked bricks

<p>We
created The Byway Collective as a way to honor and recognize aspiring,
hard-working artists of all mediums, who work their asses off, doing the only
thing they know how to do, creating art, music, photos, tattoos, clothes, drinks, stories, and—well—you get the picture. </p>
<p>Malcolm Gladwell’s 10,000-hour rule is the God-honest truth. Before you can ever see a dollar for your work, you have to put in the time and these folks are right in the thick of it. They have no promise that
their hard work will pay off, they have no promise of reward or success, but
they <i>do </i>have a hell of a lot of
promise.</p><p>We want to sit down with these artists and talk about their work. We want to talk about craft, and their creative process. We want to know how they are navigating their 10,000 hours, how they started out, what happens when they can't find a mentor, and how things like social media have changed the creative process. But more than that, we want to give aspiring artists a moment in the spotlight. We want to recognize their hard work, their dedication, their attention to detail, their love for their craft, and their resilience. There is an entire generation of artists who are creating art silently, without any recognition.

<b>Travel.</b> Most of our interviews will be conducted over the phone, but occasionally we want to travel to an artist, meet them, see what they're doing, where they work, and produce a short video interview with them.

<li>
<b>Publication. </b>In addition to our online videos, we want to produce a print journal that publishes the work of the artists we've recognized over the past six months.

We
created The Byway Collective as a way to honor and recognize aspiring,
hard-working artists of all mediums, who work their asses off, doing the only
thing they know how to do, creating art, music, photos, tattoos, clothes, drinks, stories, and—well—you get the picture. 
Malcolm Gladwell’s 10,000-hour rule is the God-honest truth. Before you can ever see a dollar for your work, you have to put in the time and these folks are right in the thick of it. They have no promise that
their hard work will pay off, they have no promise of reward or success, but
they do have a hell of a lot of
promise.We want to sit down with these artists and talk about their work. We want to talk about craft, and their creative process. We want to know how they are navigating their 10,000 hours, how they started out, what happens when they can't find a mentor, and how things like social media have changed the creative process. But more than that, we want to give aspiring artists a moment in the spotlight. We want to recognize their hard work, their dedication, their attention to detail, their love for their craft, and their resilience. There is an entire generation of artists who are creating art silently, without any recognition. We plan to change that, but we need your help to get there. (Photo Credit: Jamie King)What We Need & What You GetWe know that $9,000.00 is a lot of money, but because the three of us are all starting out, and supporting young families, we are still collecting the tools and software that we need to create something like this.

<h3>Lit Crawl London</h3>
<div class=""mbl"">
<div class=""mhl"">An entire London literary festival packed into one raucous ramble through Covent Garden and Soho.<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<div class=""mvm uiP fsm"">
<span class=""fwb""> </span><p></p>
The idea is simple: the Lit Crawl is a pub crawl where you don’t just get to sample the local brew, but also the works of up-and-coming writers, authors and poets. It was created by San Francisco’s literary festival, Litquake, in 2004, as the grand finale to its week-long celebration of the written word. It has now become an event in its own right, with Lit Crawl spin offs in New York’s Manhattan and Brooklyn, Austin and Seattle, with Los Angeles and Iowa City being added to the list this year.<br/>Lit Crawl London will be the first Lit Crawl in Europe.</div>
<p> </p>
<p>The founder of Lit Crawl London, Mette Risa, volunteered for the original San Francisco version of the Lit Crawl in 2010 and 2011. Amazed that such an event did not yet exist in London, she has organised the first Lit Crawl outside the US to take place on 7 September in Soho and Covent Garden, with great help from Saskia Vogel.</p>
</div>
<p>Lit Crawl London will be a celebration of literature and a venue for the different literary communities in London to come together to promote their work. </p>
</div>
<p>
</p>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>This is what we need money for to make sure the first Lit Crawl London will not be the last one:</p>
<ul>
<li>Venue hire - the venues we use are either provided free, or for a reduced fee, but there is still a small amount to pay.</li>
<li>Printing - we have to print a program with a map and details of all the different events.</li>
<li>Website - hosting and design</li>
</ul>
<p>We are aiming to raise at least £1000, that will cover these costs. However, we would also like to be able to cover travel costs for all the participating authors and poets. If we get less than our aim, the organisation will find it harder (though not impossible) to produce the next Lit Crawl. If we get more, we can make the contributors a little happier and make sure next year's Lit Crawl will be even bigger and better!</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>What you get</h3>
<p>Did I mention that all the events are free? We want everyone to be able to attend the Lit Crawl, regardless of their financial circumstances. Any contributors will be thanked on our website (unless you choose not to), and probably in every divine afterlife you choose to believe in (not really up to me though, but if it was...).</p>
<p>Why does literature matter? I found this explanation online, that covers it pretty well:</p>
<p><span>Literature helps us understand and make sense of the world around us. Through literature, we explore the human condition and analyse how and why people think the way they think and feel the way they feel. Literature enables us to develop our minds analytically and promotes open minds. We see the world through the eyes of different writers from different cultures and in turn learn the ways to deal with things happening around us. Without literature, we lack insight and understanding of human nature. </span> (<strong><a href=""http://tinyurl.com/lf84ro5"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://tinyurl.com/lf84ro5</a>)</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<ul>
<li>Please share this campaign with anyone you think might be interested in supporting us.</li>
<li>Also, please come to the Lit Crawl on 7 September! And tell your friends, family and colleagues to come too. It's all free, remember?</li>
<li>We're on litcrawl.org/london, facebook.com/litcrawllondon, twitter @litcrawllondon where you will find details of the different events.</li>

It was created by San Francisco’s literary festival, Litquake, in 2004, as the grand finale to its week-long celebration of the written word. It has now become an event in its own right, with Lit Crawl spin offs in New York’s Manhattan and Brooklyn, Austin and Seattle, with Los Angeles and Iowa City being added to the list this year.Lit Crawl London will be the first Lit Crawl in Europe.
 
The founder of Lit Crawl London, Mette Risa, volunteered for the original San Francisco version of the Lit Crawl in 2010 and 2011. Amazed that such an event did not yet exist in London, she has organised the first Lit Crawl outside the US to take place on 7 September in Soho and Covent Garden, with great help from Saskia Vogel.

Lit Crawl London will be a celebration of literature and a venue for the different literary communities in London to come together to promote their work. 



What We Need 
This is what we need money for to make sure the first Lit Crawl London will not be the last one:

Venue hire - the venues we use are either provided free, or for a reduced fee, but there is still a small amount to pay.
Printing - we have to print a program with a map and details of all the different events.
Website - hosting and design

We are aiming to raise at least £1000, that will cover these costs. However, we would also like to be able to cover travel costs for all the participating authors and poets. If we get less than our aim, the organisation will find it harder (though not impossible) to produce the next Lit Crawl. If we get more, we can make the contributors a little happier and make sure next year's Lit Crawl will be even bigger and better!



What you get
Did I mention that all the events are free? We want everyone to be able to attend the Lit Crawl, regardless of their financial circumstances. Any contributors will be thanked on our website (unless you choose not to), and probably in every divine afterlife you choose to believe in (not really up to me though, but if it was...).
Why does literature matter? I found this explanation online, that covers it pretty well:
Literature helps us understand and make sense of the world around us. Through literature, we explore the human condition and analyse how and why people think the way they think and feel the way they feel. Literature enables us to develop our minds analytically and promotes open minds. We see the world through the eyes of different writers from different cultures and in turn learn the ways to deal with things happening around us. Without literature, we lack insight and understanding of human nature.  (http://tinyurl.com/lf84ro5)

<h1>What is Sanctae?</h1>
<p><em>""Every image says so much about the truth of real women's bodies. We all have scars and oddities. Not one photo shows a perfect body. </em><em>And yet everywhere in today's society, women are bombarded with unreal images of idealised female sexuality - photographs of models with every imperfection eliminated. </em><em>Ione's work is important because it reminds all women that the images we see in the media are not real.""</em></p>
<p>Anonymous, 50, Dartmoor - Sanctae model</p>
<p><em><strong><br/></strong></em><strong>Sanctae</strong> is a photographic installation of 21 larger than life size (8ft x 3ft) female nudes that reveres real, ordinary women as saints. The series is resonant with historical and religious symbols and signs, and explores the intense emotions, expectations and sacrifices inherent in the female body's potential to give life. It creates a space of challenging reflections and revelations about issues of contemporary womanhood. </p>
<p>I’ve been on an inspirational three-year journey creating 21 images ­– and am proud to say that they’re all complete. Now, in the final stages of the project, I need your help to exhibit these saints across the UK and Europe.</p>

It will be a place for local artist, of all sorts, to display and sell art. I will also be a tattoo studio that will move away from what is traditionally thought of a tattoo shop.

<div>What I am looking for is the funding i need to get started. There is quite a bit of equipment that is needed to open a shop.

my name is Chad Fearnow, and i am starting a tattoo studio that will be unique to my city. I'm building a studio that will also serve as an art gallery. It will be a place for local artist, of all sorts, to display and sell art. I will also be a tattoo studio that will move away from what is traditionally thought of a tattoo shop. When a new client walks in, I want them to feel like they walked in to an art gallery, more than a tattoo shop.   What i need,
What I am looking for is the funding i need to get started. There is quite a bit of equipment that is needed to open a shop. I will need everything from tattoo chair, sterilization equipment, to remodel materials for the building itself. My hope is to raise enough money to use towards a down payment on a loan.

<br/><p><b>About Me </b></p>
<p>I’m a New York-based Puerto Rican artist. Growing up in
San Sebastian, a valley surrounded by mountains in Puerto Rico, shaped my
perception of nature as a source of beauty, and has
inspired my artistic practice. I use photography, video, sculpture and
installation to transform the visual structures of nature into
artistic objects. I create works of art that explore the physical experience of
looking through photography and invite the viewer to reexamine his/her own
perception of form, light, and space in the natural landscape. For more
information about my artistic practice visit: <a href=""http://www.josesotophotography.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.josesotophotography.com</a></p>
<p><b>What do I want to do?</b></p>
<p>I want
to install <i>FOCUS</i> at East Harlem Art Park, where it can be enjoyed by the public
for free. <i>FOCUS</i> is concerned with the viewer’s visual perception and bodily
experience. It consists of two large rectangular-shaped pieces, one
placed in a vertical position and the other in a horizontal position. Each
piece has two squared-shaped holes, which serve as apertures from where viewers
can see their surroundings within a limited scope. The sculpture has a golden mirror-like surface that will reflect and project surrounding light.  When the
viewer looks through the square opening, they will see an abstraction of their surroundings. By limiting the
scope of their view, they can take more control over their focus of attention and
see things in a mindful way. <i>FOCUS</i><span> combines the
illusionism of photography with the specificity of actual forms in the space to
fully engage the spectator and facilitate his/her apprehension of the work as a
whole.</span></p>

exhibition of public art curated by Warren James. The show features works that

New York City.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is the statement by curator Warren James
about FOCUS:</p>
<p>“José Soto is an artist that, through
photography and sculpture, deals with and expresses geometric growth, as seen
in the infinite shapes of layered grids and the framing devices for both humans
and landscapes. At times telescopic and others monolithic, Soto frames a series
of perspectives and points of view and the focal points are the visible growth
in and outside the park itself. Placement may include strategic framing of the
Rodriguez red steel sculpture and is designed to engage both adults and children.
A key aspect of growth is horizontal distance and its counterpart is vertical
mass both represented here.”</p>

Fortunately, I have been able to cover approximately half of the total cost ($4500) using academic based scholarships and grants, leaving roughly $4500 to fully fund my expedition. 
Your support will directly fund the program cost, therefore helping me pay my class tuition, housing fees, health insurance abroad, art supplies and books, and academic field trips to visit historically significant sites while on the trip. 
Any and all donations will be greatly appreciated and will help me get closer to the full amount! Thank you!
Perks 

To fully express my gratitude to every single person who supports my endeavor, I have created a full array of great perks that you will receive upon your donation. 
These include letters, postcards, signed posters, original signed and numbered limited edition intaglio prints, and original paintings. The details of these perks are listed on the right side of the page along with the dollar amount they correspond to. 
Providing artwork is the least I can do to thank you for supporting me, and I hope you enjoy it! I do not have pictures of the specific prints or paintings you will receive, however, if you would like to view some of my work, I have provided some photos on the ""Gallery"" tab of this page. 
 If you are unable to donate, but would still like to support my academic and artistic expedition, please share this page on your social media accounts, and help me gain exposure! I appreciate it! 
Thank You!
I have travelled abroad on academic trips before, and they are some of the most rewarding and significant experiences possible. This will be the first time I can create art and work in my field abroad, and I know it will be even more valuable of an experience because of that. Your support is incredibly important, and I will be forever thankful for all donations. 
My Sincere Appreciation,

Una vez que se crea y se dedicó el mural, el mural servirá como punto de partida y el lugar será utilizado para inspirar una variedad de programas de artes culturales que pueden incluir lecturas de poesía al aire libre de verano mensuales gratuitas para el público, y una variedad de arte literaria y programada talleres estructurados diseñados para que siga manteniendo los miembros de la comunidad a participar en estas actividades artísticas positiva en su comunidad.
Todos estos poetas a excepción de que era de la generación anterior a mí Julia de Burgos (17 febrero 1914 hasta 6 julio 1953), eran muy, muy queridos amigos míos, que eran parte de mi familia, por lo que este proyecto es muy importante para mí y para muchos de mis compañeros artistas amigos de Chicago, que descansen en paz.

El título mural ""Word Dealer's"" proviene de un poema de uno de nuestro querido de Chicago poeta David Hernández, antes de su fallecimiento, explicó este poema, ""Escribí este poema como un plan de desarrollo económico artes, la idea es que si podemos conseguir la distribuidores de calle para hacer frente palabras / poesía en lugar de vender drogas esta conversión mejorará la calidad de nuestra comunidad de la vida. Cualquier contribución que pueden hacer para llevar este proyecto a la realidad será muy apreciado por los miembros, así como a la comunidad. las donaciones monetarias pueden hacerse aquí en IndieGoGo o enviados a: PIERCE Memorial Mural, 3501 W.

<p>In two weeks, I’m running a 10k. This began as a personal goal over the summer.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>As admirable as personal fitness goals are, I’ve realized in recent weeks that most of my personal goals (running a 10k, graduating from university, getting into grad school) are luxuries. My basic daily needs are more than filled, and so I can worry about my workload, my extracurricular responsibilities, my personal health. 
</p>
<p>And so, a few weeks ago, I decided I wasn’t just running for me anymore.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Media coverage of the Syrian refugee crisis has fluctuated, but the numbers have remained staggering- 4 million refugees, 7.5 million internally displaced. In Lebanon, 1 in 5 people are refugees (mostly Syrians, some Iraqis). The UN and the usual crisis response parties are ill-equipped to handle both the amount of people and the length of the crisis (civil war broke out in 2011). </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>I’m launching this campaign to sponsor my 10k in two weeks to raise money for the Canadian Foodgrains Bank, who are working on the ground in Lebanon, Jordan and Syria (<a href=""http://foodgrainsbank.ca/campaigns/syria/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>http://foodgrainsbank.ca/campaigns/syria/</span></a>) to provide food relief. More broadly than their relief work, their organization is an ecumenical response to food justice issues around the world, so I’m excited to partner with them for this project.</p>
<p>For more detail on my motivation and passion for this project, check out my blog post here - <a href=""https://thebarefootscholar.wordpress.com/2015/09/29/ill-walk-through-hell-with-you/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://thebarefootscholar.wordpress.com/2015/09/29/ill-walk-through-hell-with-you/</a></p> </div> <div> <h3>The Details</h3> <p>The goal is set at $500 ($50 per kilometre), but hopefully we can do better! Every little bit counts</p>
<p>The money raised will be collected by me and sent to the Canadian Foodgrains Bank by cheque, designated for Syria crisis relief. If you would like a tax receipt, either donate directly through CFB (<a href=""http://foodgrainsbank.ca/donate-now/)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://foodgrainsbank.ca/donate-now/)</a> or talk to me (and I might be able to sort something out my contacts in the organization).</p>

<p><img alt=""Ashwaugh Hall, Springs New York"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/565661/pictures/original/20121203134943-IMG_1016BWb.jpg?1354571383"" src="""" style=""""/> </p>
<p><strong>The Series is Complete…</strong></p>
<p>It took 3 years.  I journeyed and worked on them from the jungles of Costa Rica to Israel's Holy Land, back to my birth place in Montana, then to Shelter Island in New York. And now, I’m back west again, in Idaho on the Nez Perce Reservation, where I’m framing and putting the finishing touches on the series. </p>
<p><strong>It’s Been Selected for Museum Placement…</strong></p>
<p>I’m ready for this work to be seen.  Last year, while I was living in New York I submitted it to the nation’s only public relations firm that deals exclusively with artists.  It’s a prestigious and credible company and their selection process is very competitive.  They only take on artists whose work they know they can place. A signed 18 month contract with them guarantees me at least 2 one-man museum shows.  The good news is - I’m in; I’ve been selected for their museum placement program. A public relations campaign with this company will help bring these paintings to the wider masses. The services are all fee based, and I need your help to establish my PR campaign with them. </p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>My Story:</strong></h3>
<p>I’ve painted full time for over 30 years - coming time and again to a familiar cross road.  I’ve had my share of success, raised 6 children doing only this, but there have also been some lean times along the way. For the duration of my career my paintings have shown in galleries throughout the US that carry mainly impressionistic representational landscape and genre work typified by Southwest Art Magazine. The thing is, I am experimental in my approach to painting and I’m drawn to diverse subject matter.  The spiritual work is a passion for me and though it’s not the only thing I paint, I foresee it being a focus for many years to come. My old galleries are just not a good fit anymore so I am so thankful to have this opportunity to promote what I’m painting now.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>My Project:</strong></h3>
<h3>An 18 month public relations contract to promote the “Torah Series”</h3>
<p><img alt=""Torah Series Installations 4 and 5"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/565706/pictures/original/20121203143435-IMG_1126a.jpg?1354574086"" src="""" style=""float: left; margin-right: 7px; margin-left: 7px;""/></p>
<p>Included in the contract is all the specialized research to place my work; implementation and follow-up with no less than 300 museum contacts and also surrounding art centers, better college and university galleries, alternative and corporate spaces, and commercial galleries nationwide; writing services by known art critics; preparation and mailing of quality color catalogues, promotional packets, press releases, etc. and my inclusion on the company’s web site.</p>
<h3><strong>54 Postmodern Paintings, arranged in six installations, approx. 6 by 6 feet, each containing nine 2 by 2 feet canvases based on the weekly readings from the Hebrew Bible </strong></h3>
<p>The stories are universal and contain truths and ethics for all people. Through painting the stories I've come to know things I didn’t before. <img alt=""Vayrika"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/567928/pictures/original/20121204211256-3__vayikra__painting_24__inatallation_3a.jpg?1354684376"" src="""" style=""float: right; margin: 7px;""/> I think these paintings reveal different things to different people and deliver new truths continually because there is something of the Eternal that resides in them.</p>
<p>To get beyond estabished ideas about the stories I re-imaged them in a way that couldn't be taken in at a single glance. I wanted to create a mix of literature, psychic shock, and unconscious visual aesthetics to arrive at a new state of pictorial reasoning. The images need to be absorbed piece by piece, to overwhelm what's already known, allowing a new rhythm to run through every part to result in the miracle - an overall sense unity inviting something not previously known.</p>
<p>I started with random washes of neutral colors and next with a drawing, something tangible, then the idea was to start intuiting, to become childlike enough to trust the process, to get out of the way. Eventually there came a point of sacrificing the drawing; shapes and colors become the order in interest of the whole. The departure from a literal interpretation or illustration leaves room for the Ruach (or Spirit) to engage the viewer from within rather than me imposing something from without.</p>
<p>To me the paintings are like stained glass windows or post-modern icons, representative of the stories.  In the same way that the title of each passage evokes the essence of the entire reading for sages and scholars, I become re-immersed in a dialogue with the respective passage when I engage the individual paintings .  </p>
<p>In my wife's words, ""These paintings sprang from the ritual of creation, each burst of inspiration had a sense of the sacred.  Relating intimately with sacred texts, re-imaging old stories, interacting with ancient spiritual truths in the context of creative innovation became new rituals altogether"".</p>

<p><strong>These guys are a constant support and inspiration to me, they've stood with me through the thick and thin of many adventures.</strong></p>
<p>Left to Right: Daughter - Tali, Baker Extrodiare; Son - Francis (Switz Jr), Oil Painter in his own right; Son - Malachi, Beats 2<sup>nd</sup> to none; Son- Rob, Switzervideos, many hours, many thanks; My wife Shelley - her adaptations of the Torah readings accompany the paintings and are included in some of the perks we are offering (see below); Son - Scott Jr, Commercial Fisherman, Builder, all around Vagabond; and Son - Cody, Jedi Master in disguise and Director of Youth on Record Alaska.  Not Pictured: Cody’s wife Brittani or his kids Harmony, Justice, and Talon and our other Brittani, Rob’s new bride.  (We’re doing pretty good getting this many of us in one picture but we'll keep trying and maybe update later.)</p>
<h2><strong>Nuanced Connections and Ongoing Goodness</strong></h2>
<p>Chief Don Miguel and the Wimea people of Costa Rica welcomed me to their land to work when I first started this series so I gave them the studies for the first installation.  A year later, to honor the decendents of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob for preserving and keeping the Torah, I presented the first nine paintings completed from those studies to The Jerusalem Great Synagogue in Israel where they now hang in the hallway to the Rabbi's study.  On my way back to the U.S., I stopped in Vilnius, Lithuania to check out the newly opened Vilnius Jewish Library and gave them a hand-embellished giclee of that first installation. In my mind those were all kind of first fruits of the series. I like to think there is now an unexplainable shared goodness between all these people because of their welcome and reception of this work; and I invite you to be a part of it too.</p>
<h2><strong>Where does the Money Go?</strong></h2>
<p>I need at least $12,000 to get my public relations campaign started.  You can see by the breakdown of expenses below that I will definitely appreciate and be able to apply any funds that go over my goal.  I need to raise:</p>
<p>$3000 - for 500 tri-fold color CD mailers right away</p>
<p>$9000 - for a contract term of 18 months (6000 to be paid at signing, 3000 by 120 days later) </p>
<p>Traveling expenses either for me to return to New York to meet with the art critic who will be writing the essay about my work or to bring him to my studio Idaho.</p>
<p>As exhibitions are secured I will need additional placement fees per size and importance of each venue.  My contract guarantees me a minimum of two one-person venue placements and more with no limits to the number except as specified by me.</p>
<ul>
<li>Level 1 - $900 to $2100</li>
<li>Level 2 - $2100 to $3600</li>
<li>Level 3 - $3600 to $5400</li>
<li>Elite - $5500 to $10,000</li>

<p class=""p1""><strong>What's this about?</strong></p>
<p class=""p1"">I work freelanced since three years. Last year I decided that I want to do one personal work at the end of every year. To wrap it up with something nice. Non profit, to share with those who enjoy looking at nice things. So what's better than putting all this into an advent calendar.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Last year's work AC11 focused on food and drew a portrait of a complete three course christmas meal including drinks.</p>

<p class=""p1"">This year's calendar will cover a complete different topic.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Of course I cannot tell you what, since the joy of an advent calendar is the surprise effect, but the outcome will be a piece of art you can order for your home.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Yes, you heard right!!! This year you can order the AC12 from 1st November on as an actual advent calendar for your home. Shipping will begin 19th of November so your calendar will be safe and sound with you at the 1st of December.</p>

<p class=""p1"">Printing and material costs are covered.</p>
<p class=""p1"">But paying fees to crew, for rental equipment and location sums up to 1000 EUR.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Yes, I know - crazy. I tried to work around this, but without this extra grand I will not be able to produce in proper quality. And if I cannot produce in proper quality I don't produce. That's what I stand for.</p>
<p class=""p3""> </p>
<p class=""p1"">I am asking you to help me raise these 1000 EUR so I can produce this lovely advent calendar 2012.</p>

Thank you. Nina
 
What's this about?
I work freelanced since three years. Last year I decided that I want to do one personal work at the end of every year. To wrap it up with something nice. Non profit, to share with those who enjoy looking at nice things. So what's better than putting all this into an advent calendar.
Last year's work AC11 focused on food and drew a portrait of a complete three course christmas meal including drinks.
Originally produced for the website it was selected to be shown during the Browse Photo Festival 2012 and exhibited from 1st of june till the 30th of august.
The photos were printed on a Fine Art Pearl Paper, 15x22cm, framed by a beautiful Ragtime museum passepartout and handmade wood frames from the black forrest. Limited to an edition of 5.

<p>My name is Salvadora McCaffrey and I am a senior set design major at a performing arts high school. For my project, I will be building a factory farm set using the elements of set, lighting, prop, and sound design to create an experiential set so the audience can travel through and understand the existence the animals in this farm must endure. A couple months ago, I received a couple grants and support to go forward with this project. With your help I can afford the rest of this project. Because of the unethical practice of industrial farming, I became a vegetarian and I started becoming interested in food justice. Factory farming is an agricultural practice that adversely affects our environment, personal health, the welfare of animals, and our local economy. If we can reduce factory farming and increase the local farming where we live, then we in turn can experience a wonderful range of benefits from better health to a richer local economy. My contributors will be helping me in affording to buy the necessary materials for construction and print production.<br/><span style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em; letter-spacing: 0.06em;""><br/></span></p>

<div>I've always wanted to illustrate a children's book...He always wanted to become a published children's book author.  Little Myrtle is a dream come true for both of us.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We love Myrtle! She is love and she's full of the beauty of life!  And, to our team, she's like family.  The book was certainly a family effort.  Paul Trefz is the author of the children's poem which I interpreted into collage based on the drawings of Paul's young daughter.  The children featured in the song are our children and god children.  Over the past year, we have worked on the illustrations, design and layout of the book. </div>
<h2><strong>An amazingly positive response from the public!</strong></h2>
<div>We had a short run of the book printed this Spring and quickly sold them all!  In the process, we were able to get the feedback of more than 500 individuals in Philadelphia...And they loved Myrtle as much as we do!  We found that the book made people smile and even chuckle out loud; children were anxious to get their hands on it. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Adults wanted to talk about the moral of the story or they were inspired to tell us about their own dreams of creating  a children's book.  Most surprising was that people we met while vending were so grateful for our presence. We realized that beyond creating literature we were creating public spaces for sharing stories around the value of dreams, family and self determination.  Myrtle had become a public performance!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We collected signatures from people who read or bought the book.  We wondered: how could we make Little Myrtle More than a local phenomenon?  And just how many signatures could we collect in six months?  A million? That's a stretch...but it's fun to dream big isn't it? That's what the Myrtle's Millions tour is about.</div>
<h2><strong>Please support our book project!</strong></h2>
<div>Your contributions will get us started in really distributing the book to the public.  We will be able to pay for a larger printing. Contributions will also pay for promotional materials and transportation.  We will be able to travel with our family to create spaces where children and children's literature are loved. <br/><p>By contributing to our campaign you get to become a part of Myrtle's story and a part our family's experiment in social entrepreneurship.  <span id=""taw"" style=""margin-right: 0;""></span></p>

<p>UFOs are something that people have been curious about for thousands of years. There are reported sighting worldwide everyday and it continues to be in our popular culture. There have been countless studies, articles, books and theories written about the subject. </p>
<p>Whatever your perspective is on UFOs, it’s clearly something people are interested in. </p>
<p>Our team includes people of sound mind who wanted to go to a UFO museum one day close to home: in Paris, London and Berlin, and who realized that one had to travel thousands of miles to visit such a place. This is how we decided to create a non-profit UFO museum in London.</p>
<p>We already have access to material from a former UFO museum, but to open a new place today that would look modern, one would need much more material and to purchase new equipment. We’ve even found a few perfect locations to rent in London, but there are many other issues to solve first. We need your support to do more research, produce new information boards, manikins, videos, purchase of copyrights of pictures, purchase of screens and computers etc. The plan is to open the place when enough material is available, hopefully within one year. </p>
<p>We truly believe this is a unique, exciting project that would attract a lot of people and we need your help and support to make this become a reality.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The pictures of the perks are also in the Gallery section. </p>

</div></div>","UFOs are something that people have been curious about for thousands of years. There are reported sighting worldwide everyday and it continues to be in our popular culture. There have been countless studies, articles, books and theories written about the subject. 
Whatever your perspective is on UFOs, it’s clearly something people are interested in. 
Our team includes people of sound mind who wanted to go to a UFO museum one day close to home: in Paris, London and Berlin, and who realized that one had to travel thousands of miles to visit such a place. This is how we decided to create a non-profit UFO museum in London.
We already have access to material from a former UFO museum, but to open a new place today that would look modern, one would need much more material and to purchase new equipment. We’ve even found a few perfect locations to rent in London, but there are many other issues to solve first. We need your support to do more research, produce new information boards, manikins, videos, purchase of copyrights of pictures, purchase of screens and computers etc. The plan is to open the place when enough material is available, hopefully within one year. 
We truly believe this is a unique, exciting project that would attract a lot of people and we need your help and support to make this become a reality.
 
The pictures of the perks are also in the Gallery section. 
When ordering, specify which design you want unless you have no preference.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Anchor Studios is a new cross discipline artist co-operative in Richmond’s Art District. Located at One East Broad, our goal is to serve as an anchor for the East end of the First Friday Art Walk. We want to connect the public not just to our work but also show them how and why we make. With plans to build a gallery, <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">host resident artists, and </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">offer workshops and educational opportunities, we strive to engage the community and integrate them into our creative process. Anchor’s founding members come from varied backgrounds in painting, photography, filmmaking, tattooing, graphic design, fashion, and fibers. All VCUArts graduates, we are professors, art directors, exhibiting artists, sign painters, public speakers, and curators who are active in the Richmond art community. </span></p>
<p>We are seeking out a community of investors to support us as we make this dream a reality. We make art and run this studio because we are passionate about our creative processes and want to share that that passion with the community. Bringing our work to East Broad is giving us better visibility and at the same time contributing to ongoing neighborhood revitalization efforts. Our goal is to not just make our own work, but to offer classes to that will allow us to pass on our skills to others.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

<p>A large portion of our budget will be set aside for renovations to our storefront. While the space is beautiful, we are renting it ""as is."" Our plans call for constructing a window front mini exhibition space to display our work to the public, developing an art library for research, building a dark room for photography and screen printing capability, replacing existing track lighting and floors, and putting a fresh coat of paint on everything. We also need to build a second bathroom in order to meet zoning regulations as we grow. These improvements will allow us to continue to produce high quality work and allow us to focus on helping others do the same. <br/></p>
<p>It is important to us to give back to our community. Many of our members are art educators and believe strongly in passing on their knowledge and craft to others. Donated funds will be put towards creating workshops, classes, and events that will be open to the public. Each member of the Anchor collective will use their expertise in their field to offer a diverse range of educational opportunities. Classes will cover anything from sewing and embroidery, sign painting, photography, glass work and more.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>""Let's all move to Lawrence, KS and live in this amazing church and make theatre and stuff.""</p>
<p>When I posted this on Facebook on April 8th, I had no idea I'd be securing a lease for the place less than a week later.  And yet... and yet.</p>
<p>A bit of background: My name's Josh Meyer.  Along with Matt Hislope, I'm the co-Artistic Director of Rubber Repertory--an experimental theatre company based in Austin, TX.  Matt and I started making performances together when we were both theatre students at the University of Kansas.  After graduation, we moved to Austin and have been at it ever since.</p>
<p>As we near our 15th year of working together, it seems like a great time to do something radical, so we're heading back to where we started--Lawrence, KS--to run a temporary artists' colony in a historic church-house.  We're going to invite daring artists from a variety of disciplines (dance, theatre, fiction, photography, video, music, etc.) to come and spend some time living in the church and making something new. </p>
<p>We'll have a simple application process and will seek out a diverse group of artists: a mix of people who are part of our community and those we've never met, early and mid-career artists, those who want to work solo and those who'd like to collaborate with us or others.  Over the course of the year-long lease that begins on August 1st, we anticipate being able to host over 50 different artists for visits ranging from one to four weeks.</p>
<p>I hope you'll take a few minutes to watch the video tour, check out all of our unique perks, and consider helping us with this project.  Your donation will ensure that the Pilot Balloon Church-House is able to get off the ground and float in all kinds of unexpected directions.</p>
<p>(And we'd be remiss not to mention just a few of the church's amenities, like the 700 sq. foot open rehearsal space with beautiful oak floor, the scenic brick loft, the private second bedroom, the utility room with washer and dryer, the kitchen altar, the detached garage, the backyard porch that's perfect for communing, and on and on it goes...)</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We're asking for $8,500 in funding.  This will subsidize a portion of our rent and utilities (which will total $1,600-$1,700 a month) and allow us to keep artist fees minimal.  We plan on charging artists $50-$75 a week, but if we exceed our funding goal, we'll be able to bring this number down even lower, and possibly offer travel grants as well.</p>
<p>I've never liked the word ""perks,"" but we've got twelve of them for you to check-out and see what suits your fancy.  There are scripts, CDs, original art, singing telegrams, Rubber Rep golden tickets, a private performance by Austin's premiere storytelling collective, a postcard-of-the-month club, and guaranteed stays at Pilot Balloon.  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Even in cities like Austin that are so teeming with creativity, it can be difficult to find a good place to rehearse, compose, choreograph, etc.  I've often found myself living in a cramped apartment and dependent on pay-by-the-hour rehearsal spaces that fill up months in advance.  The Pilot Balloon Church-House doesn't solve this problem, but spaces like this can be part of a solution.</p>
<p>*We want to give people another tool they can use to create the work they need to make.</p>
<p>*We want to facilitate relationships between artists from different backgrounds and locations.  </p>
<p>*We want to introduce others to the offbeat and idyllic setting of Lawrence, KS.</p>
<p>*We want to see if it's possible for two guys without any private funding or personal fortune to succeed in their crazy impulse to run an artists' colony for a year. The proverbial, ""If we can do it, <em>anyone</em> can.""</p>
<p>And of course, even though we'll be the ones shoveling the snow (!!) and mowing the lawn, Matt and I stand to benefit considerably by living in the house for the duration and interacting with all of the artists who pass through.  We get a little misty thinking about the work we'll be able to get done.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you can't contribute, we'd be so grateful if you could share this project with friends or with anyone else who might be interested.  Also, if you'd like to join us at Pilot Balloon, please keep an eye out for the residency application in Mid-May.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I’m Cynthia Rahming, 2010 Judo Youth Olympian from the Bahamas. You may have heard about the controversy from the BBC World News about the ‘G’ Word. Well I am the athlete behind the G Word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it started with an interview for Judo with the BBC World News. And I threw the host and he said that he’d never live down being beaten by a 19 year old girl. After the BBC World News aired it the first time, the second time they aired the interview they edited the word “girl” out. I guess they figured it might offend someone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was not offended by it, but I do respect different feelings and I understand that someone might be offended by it. And I do see that everyone has different feelings because I see this even within my own family.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the BBC took out the ‘G’ word it created a media storm that went all the way to the British Parliament, to newspapers in Australia and even made its way to the O’Reilly factor.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><b>                       G Word Controversy Appeared on Several Media</b></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/632334/files/20140607120303-BBC_World_News.jpeg?1402167783"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/632338/files/20140607120449-mail_online_logo.jpg?1402167889"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/632341/files/20140607120551-The_Oreilly_factor.jpeg?1402167951"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/632342/files/20140607120627-Melbourn_daily_Star.png?1402167987"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/632343/files/20140607120649-World_Radio.jpeg?1402168009"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/632346/files/20140607120706-Huffington_post.jpeg?1402168026"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/632347/files/20140607120719-The_Telegraph.jpg?1402168039"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/632348/files/20140607120728-the_times.jpeg?1402168048"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><b>                   How I Am Able to Throw Someone Twice My Size</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/632395/files/20140607122837-Photo_of_lunge_wm.jpg?1402169317"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b></b></p><p><br/></p>
<p>
</p><p>Elite Athletes do amazing things. I’ve been training for seven years and now I train 30 hours a week. That involves running in the morning, weight lifting in the afternoon, then training again in the late afternoon for Judo. All that training makes us able to amaze people.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On top of all of that training athletes can be multi talented. Personally I do art. I love to make ceramics, I love to draw, and I also love to paint. So I channel my athleticism into my art.</p>
<p>The Olympic values are respect, excellence and friendship. So I’ve painted a series of women demonstrating these values in the Olympic disciplines. I call this series my ‘G’ Word series. I’m doing an Olympic run which involves 25 tournaments in different countries and this can be quite costly. So I’ve decided to share my artwork to those who pledge to my cause.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So please check them out. And thanks for your support.</p>

I’m Cynthia Rahming, 2010 Judo Youth Olympian from the Bahamas. You may have heard about the controversy from the BBC World News about the ‘G’ Word. Well I am the athlete behind the G Word.

So it started with an interview for Judo with the BBC World News. And I threw the host and he said that he’d never live down being beaten by a 19 year old girl. After the BBC World News aired it the first time, the second time they aired the interview they edited the word “girl” out. I guess they figured it might offend someone.

I was not offended by it, but I do respect different feelings and I understand that someone might be offended by it. And I do see that everyone has different feelings because I see this even within my own family.

After the BBC took out the ‘G’ word it created a media storm that went all the way to the British Parliament, to newspapers in Australia and even made its way to the O’Reilly factor.                       G Word Controversy Appeared on Several Media                   How I Am Able to Throw Someone Twice My Size

Elite Athletes do amazing things. I’ve been training for seven years and now I train 30 hours a week. That involves running in the morning, weight lifting in the afternoon, then training again in the late afternoon for Judo. All that training makes us able to amaze people.

On top of all of that training athletes can be multi talented. Personally I do art. I love to make ceramics, I love to draw, and I also love to paint. So I channel my athleticism into my art.
The Olympic values are respect, excellence and friendship. So I’ve painted a series of women demonstrating these values in the Olympic disciplines. I call this series my ‘G’ Word series. I’m doing an Olympic run which involves 25 tournaments in different countries and this can be quite costly. So I’ve decided to share my artwork to those who pledge to my cause.

So please check them out. And thanks for your support.

                                                       My Art Work
The Archer ( 11 X 14 Canvas):

When persons are performing archery there is a certain grace in something that is easy to perform but difficult to master. The lines in the body are ascetically pleasing.

The Gymnast (11 X 14 Canvas):Sports can also be entertaining. With a simple ribbon, this gymnast demonstrates flexibility, beauty and grace. There is originality in every routine.Strength and Beauty (11 X 14 Canvas): This painting was inspired by a photo of a painting that I saw online. I was attracted by the simplicity and the relaxed state she was in while performing a tremendous feat of strength. In the Olympic sport of Judo in addition to  being very strong, you have to keep your head on your shoulders when you fight. 

The Boxer (16 x 20 Canvas):Power and speed of the hands are reflected in this drawing. Along with cooperation of your training partner. I wanted to concentrate on the upper body where the focus in this moment is taking place.

The Judo champion (16 X 20 Canvas):This painting captures the dedication necessary to defeat another person. It captures the moment as you go past your opponents tipping point, where he can no longer hold his balance and is thrown with control and force to his back.

The Lunge (16 X 20 Canvas):The lunge demonstrates strength, balance and  explosive power. The ability to work with a partner using his body weight is a great way to train and build friendships.   What I Need & What You Get Here's What I need & What You Get: 
I'm trying to raise $50,000 to pay for tournament travel, specialist coaches, sports psychologists, uniforms and other things related to high level athletics.

<ul>
<li>Bi-Color, eine einzigartige Sammlung an Illustrationen, die nur schwarz, weiß und eine zusätzliche Farbe beinhalten. An diesem Buch beteiligten sich vor allem Zeichner der deutschen Plattform Animexx, aber auch internationale Künstler aus Brasilien und China sind mit von der Partie.<br/>
</li>
<li>Lemongrass, ein Buch, 6 Zeichner: Aziell, Del Borovic, Diana Liesaus, Nina Nowacki, SlippedDee und Zel. <br/>

Although we mainly specialize in Comic and Manga – the not-so-hidden passion of the editorial staff! – we already created three major artbook-projects, which were released in print:<br/><br/><ul>
<li>Bi-Color: A unique collection of illustrations printed in black, white, and one additional colour. The book placed its main focus on German artists active on the Anime and Manga-centric website Animexx.de, but also inspired international artists from Brazil and China.<br/>
</li>
<li>Lemongrass: One book, six artists. Aziell, Del Borovic, Diana Liesaus, Nina Nowacki, SlippedDee and Zel came together to create a work of art.<br/>

Thank you so much for giving us the chance to create this book!Hier seht ihr eine detaillierte Vorschau:Go here for a detailed preview: http://www.fireangels.net/Artbook/Dragonlords/dragonlords_digitalextra.pdf

Fireangels, ursprünglich als kleiner deutscher Verlag gegründet, expandierte schnell über die Grenzen des Landes hinaus und veröffentlicht seit 2005 Zeichner aus der ganzen Welt. Und auch wenn Comics und Manga die eigentliche Leidenschaft der Redaktion sind, haben wir schon 3 große Artbookprojekte ins Leben gerufen und als Bücher herausgebracht: 

Bi-Color, eine einzigartige Sammlung an Illustrationen, die nur schwarz, weiß und eine zusätzliche Farbe beinhalten. An diesem Buch beteiligten sich vor allem Zeichner der deutschen Plattform Animexx, aber auch internationale Künstler aus Brasilien und China sind mit von der Partie.

Lemongrass, ein Buch, 6 Zeichner: Aziell, Del Borovic, Diana Liesaus, Nina Nowacki, SlippedDee und Zel. 

World of Aziell: drin ist, was drauf steht! Atemberaubend schöne Werke aus der Feder der talentierten Italienerin als hochwertiges Hardcover-Buch mit 112 Seiten


Fireangels is the name of a German publishing house, which quickly expanded across the boundaries of its homeland and releases artists all across the world since 2005. Although we mainly specialize in Comic and Manga – the not-so-hidden passion of the editorial staff! – we already created three major artbook-projects, which were released in print:
Bi-Color: A unique collection of illustrations printed in black, white, and one additional colour. The book placed its main focus on German artists active on the Anime and Manga-centric website Animexx.de, but also inspired international artists from Brazil and China.

Lemongrass: One book, six artists. Aziell, Del Borovic, Diana Liesaus, Nina Nowacki, SlippedDee and Zel came together to create a work of art.

Word of Aziell: Breathtaking artworks by the talented Italian artist, blended in an exquisite hardcover book with 112 pages in total!

Mit  deiner Unterstützung sicherst du in erster Linie den Druck des Projekts. Dieser beläuft sich auf ca. 3.000.- Euro. Zuzüglich der 
Gebühren für diese Kampagne benötigen wir ein Kapital von 3.200.- Euro. 
Jeder Cent, den wir darüber hinaus einnehmen, geht vorangig in die Bezahlung der Künstler. Jede im Buch abgedruckte Seite hat einen Gegenwert von 80.- Euro, die ohne Abzüge an jeden unserer 18 Künstler ausbezahlt wird. Je schneller sich die Bücher verkaufen, desto schneller bekommt jeder sein Honorar. Und je mehr Bücher verkauft werden, desto mehr Geld bekommt auch jeder Künstler! 

 This is where you come into play. Your support will mainly secure the print of the project at hand. The total costs of printing fall around EUR 3,000 ; adding the fees for this campaign, we need a total seed capital of EUR 3,200 to get the book started. Every additional cent earned by both this campaign and sales of the product will mainly go into the hands of our artists. Every one of the 18 artists receives a base payment of EUR 80 per page designed and printed in the book; the quicker we’re able to sell the books, the quicker our artists will receive their complete fees, as well as additional payments!

The Performance &amp; Live Art Platform Cyprus is an artist-led event which returns to Cyprus in early September 2013. This platform celebrates the work of emerging as well as established artists, who have interdisciplinary backgrounds and whose work focuses on performance and live art.</p>
<p>On Saturday 7th of September the platform will be based at the Point Centre for Contemporary Arts in Nicosia, Cyprus; this time as a one day event, which will include a half-day Symposium with the theme of ""Artistic Definitions of Performance Art"" as well as discussions on ""Performance Documentation"". The platform will also include a screening, short and durational performances, one-to-one pieces, workshops, happenings, installations, performance lectures. </p>
<p>Our aim is to create a platform that can accommodate and support the work of artists from Cyprus and abroad from the areas of performance and live art; to improve the understanding of the level of accessibility and awareness of live art across the island and most importantly to give the opportunity for Cypriot artists, who have to resort abroad, to present their work at home. This platform forms an intercultural dialogue between artists and by exploring the interdisciplinary nature of the work of each artist, it also intends to bring together local artists and visiting artists for possible future collaborations. It creates a network for possible future exchanges between the United Kingdom, Cyprus, Greece and other countries. Our platform includes live performances and will go beyond conventional boundaries and stereotypes about ""what is art"" through the kind of performance and live art.</p>

<p><em><strong>Internal Terrains</strong></em></p>
<p>What cracks appear in the density of everyday pressures and ageing? Why is the body sometimes sensitive to every sound? <em>Internal Terrains</em> explores life as a choreography of decades, in search of what’s at stake as we move from one decade to another. Poetic and sensual, the performance plays chords with films and installations, crows, cages and electric shocks.</p>
<p>Created, written and performed by Natasha Davis in collaboration with: Bob Karper (sound), Branislava Kuburović (documentation), Elisa Gallo-Rosso (objects), Lucy Cash (movement) and Marty Langthorne (lights).

<p><strong><em>HomeBirth ~ the chair of my loins ~</em></strong> A chair, It is designed to accommodate the human body; it consists of a seat, legs, back, and often arms.

<p>A visual performance piece exploring the surprises of life and its gifts.

<p><em><strong>Therapy: Session1</strong></em></p>
<p>A reformed group psychotherapy session where notions of perception, deception and authenticity are introduced. Authority is redefined, reassessed and often abused during Therapy: Session 1. The use of language functions as a barrier between performers and the audience, provoking the audience not only to overcome this barrier by contributing to the development of performance, but also to break the established role of the audience as simply passive, secluded viewers.</p>

<p><em><strong>We were never here</strong></em></p>
<p>A moment. Written. Marked down forever, made permanent.</p>
<p>A moment. Written and then washed away, but held within the fibres of the paper on which it was marked. Molded into the place it was marked, this memory object now contains its experience and place. Using a process traditionally used by archeologists, Ashleigh Griffith invites participants to create paper squeezes with her, which hold within them experiences, memories and sites. </p>

<p><strong>Artist’s Bios</strong></p>
<p><strong><strong>Yiota Demetriou</strong></strong> has a BA (Hons) in Theatre Studies from Queen Mary University of London, an MRes from the University of Hull and is currently undertaking a PhD at the University of Bristol, which is entitled <em>An Exhibition of Hidden Stories: The Lives' of Others</em> - Research into methods of staging oral history archives. She is a practitioner (performance artist and researcher). The applied theatre method that she developed in 2010-2011 through the research of her MA thesis, <em>Young Voices: An Applied Theatre Project Bridging the Gap Between Youth and Adults</em>, is widely used by youth workers. Demetriou also has her own column in a Cypriot online magazine, <em>SkalaTimes</em>, called <em>Σκέφτομαι Τέχνη</em> - <em>I Think of Art</em>, where she publishes articles, on a weekly basis in regards to her research interests and upcoming events both in the UK, which she is currently based and Cyprus, where she is originally from. Her work focuses on the memories of the audience and employs media such as live art, video and multi-media facilities. An Exhibition of Hidden Stories is her signature performance project that consists of a series of performances that explore the concepts of memory, nostalgia, and focus on her interests personal history and narrative, as well as how oral history can be staged and documented. In addition how material can be re-used for the development of a performance. Moreover, she is the initiator and curator of the <em>Performance &amp; Live Art Platform</em> in Cyprus, where she attempted to reach new audiences and create opportunities for young people working with Performance and Live Art in Cyprus. </p>
<p><strong>Alexandra R Draghici</strong>  (Romanian/Canadian) is a site-specific performance maker. Her work is interdisciplinary, incorporating soundscape, choreography, visual / land art. She has devised site-specific cross-cultural performances in community contexts. Her work is informed by: magick, witchcraft, alchemy, noetic science, yoga &amp; physiology, philosophy, psychology, and the numinosity retained in environments: material, architecture, the body, sound &amp; light.</p>
<p><strong>Theatro Transcendental</strong> is a professional theatre company based in Cyprus, with the aim of creating thought-provoking works that contribute positively to the development of human consciousness. (<a href=""http://www.theatrotranscendental.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.theatrotranscendental.com</a>)</p>
<p><strong>The Open Wide Collective</strong> is made up of Ashley J Edwards (Director, Producer and Performance Maker), Douglas Brown (Performance Maker) and Finn Anderson (Composer, Songwriter &amp; Multi-Instrumentalist). Through the creation of this project the trio have strived to produce a piece of contemporary performance art which recognises and crosses boundaries both conceptually and aesthetically to explore how the mediatisation of queerness, sexualities and deviance across cultures affects and shapes public views towards homophobia and taboos.</p>
<p><strong>Ashleigh</strong> <strong>Griffith</strong> is an undisciplined interdisciplinary artist from the UK. Her work includes and extends beyond live performance, film and installation. She uses found objects, kept objects, craft and technology to research and create through experimentation. She is currently conducting practice-based PhD research at the University of Chichester around the process of creation, dissemination and understanding of a memory, a memory object, and the creative process.</p>
<p><strong>Livia Rita and Demetris Chimonas</strong> met in London a year ago. They study Contemporary Theatre together. Livia comes from the Swiss mountains and she likes flowers, change, trains, long dresses, dreams, beautiful men and music. Demetris comes from Larnaca and he likes fat, the colour black, spontaneous drawing and dance, cleaning and feet. Demetris also likes Livia and Livia likes Demetris, too.</p>
<p><strong>Elena Kotasvili and Loucas Ioannou</strong> studied fine art in London and Berlin and have acted as a team for the last 7 years. Coming from a Fine Arts background they create performances that include double staging: partly regarding concept and space representation, and partly regarding the notion of performance itself. Their work usually stands somewhere at the borderline between reality and artificial reality, where the audience has always a key role. Loucas and Elena participated in exhibitions and art festivals in London, Berlin, Athens, Krakow, St.Petersburg and New York and they occasionally collaborate with contemporary theater and dance companies. </p>

So, why do we need your help?
This event will be FREE as we want to make it accessible for everyone! The Platform is a not-for-profit initiative supported mainly by its organizing team. All involved in this project are volunteering and investing freely from their own time towards making it a success.
However, for this event to take shape we require technical support, props, printing material, etc., while our budget also includes transportation, accommodation and catering costs for the artists, as well as advertizing costs.
Thus, we have begun this crowdfunding campaign to raise a portion of the budget that will help this project to become a reality.
Your support, however small, is significant for us!

<h3>Namaste</h3>
<p>First of all, thank you for checking out my campaign. It means so much to me!</p>
<p><strong>Who Am I?</strong></p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.whitelotusvisions.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/glowingeyes.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Allow me to introduce myself...my name is Elizabeth Shumaker, I live in Montana and I am an artist. Always have been, always will be. I want to do things with my art, go places, learn new things, and teach what I have learned....you know....contribute to making the world a better, more beautiful and harmonious place. And I feel that I do that best through my art. So art is many things to me....it is a path....a devotion....a passion....an expression of my heart's song.....and I long to share it with others!</p>
<p>I have been painting since I was 15 and took my first high-school art class. It quickly became a passion and a source of constant expression for me. I then attended Pacific Northwest College of Art for one year, and feeling like I needed a change, I moved back to my hometown of Billings, Montana. While always continuing to paint, I also became a mother, and studied massage therapy and healing arts. I currently have a massage and healing practice called <a href=""http://www.creativehealinginfo.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Creative Healing</a>, where I do massage, craniosacral, Reiki, and healing arts. I have an in-home art studio in which I spend the vast majority of my evenings, creating my art ;) <a href=""http://www.whitelotusvisions.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">White Lotus Visions.</a></p>
<p>Busy with life and raising a child as a single mother, I am primarily a self-taught painter. I haven't had too many opportunities to really devote myself to learning new artistic skills, other than doing my own research, but I am a devoted artist nonetheless and feel this would be a giant leap into a whole new territory! So exciting!!! </p>
<p><strong>What do I want to do?</strong></p>
<p><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.lcaruana.com/webmedia/seminar2013.media/sem2013.poster.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;""/></strong></p>
<p>SO, I feel one step, for me, in the direction of furthering my art career and ability to render my visions, is to attend an AMAZING seminar in Italy, this July. The seminar is called ""<a href=""http://www.lcaruana.com/webtext/lcmh.seminar.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Expanded Visions in the MicshTechnik</a>"". I will be studying with four amazing teachers/artists.....artists who's work I have admired for a long time- <a href=""http://www.amandasage.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Amanda Sage</a>, <a href=""http://sublimatrix.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">A. Andrew Gonzolez</a>, Maura Holden, and<a href=""http://www.lcaruana.com/index.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> Laurence Carauana</a>. I will be bringing my seven year old son along with me, so he will be learning and absorbing the creative spirit and culture as well! I will also be staying in an amazing Eco-Village called Torri Superiore. It is a three week long intensive painting experience! I will be learning the techniques of the masters, known as the MischTechnik, as well as some other new mediums such as special airbrush and glazing techniques. It is something I have been feeling strongly pulled to go to for the past 2 years or so. Now I feel is the opportunity! </p>
<p>This course will help me to deepen both my practical composition and style as well as ""visionary"" skills. Visionary Art is been the ""genre"" I have always painted in. I like to define visionary art as ""art that has the potential to change or alter consciousness in a spiritual and evolutionary way"". My work has always contained very deep spiritual content and symbolism. So to me, art is more than just creating a painting, it is a vision, a life an offering.....<strong><em><br/></em></strong></p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3><em>That said....this is what I need to make it happen.....</em></h3>
<p>Tuition for the full three weeks, including meals and board, and for my son and I to share a room, comes to $3670....</p>
<p>I'll also need travel expenses including airfare, train, and other travel-related expenses for my son and myself....</p>
<p>I have already paid the full tuition, but still need to raise money for the other expenses.  So I am setting my goal at $2000 and any more will go towards funding the journey! </p>
<h3><strong>What's in it for you, you ask?? Lots! :)</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Options! I have options for all different levels of support. All equally honored!</strong></p>

First of all, thank you for checking out my campaign. It means so much to me!
Who Am I?

Allow me to introduce myself...my name is Elizabeth Shumaker, I live in Montana and I am an artist. Always have been, always will be. I want to do things with my art, go places, learn new things, and teach what I have learned....you know....contribute to making the world a better, more beautiful and harmonious place. And I feel that I do that best through my art. So art is many things to me....it is a path....a devotion....a passion....an expression of my heart's song.....and I long to share it with others!
I have been painting since I was 15 and took my first high-school art class. It quickly became a passion and a source of constant expression for me. I then attended Pacific Northwest College of Art for one year, and feeling like I needed a change, I moved back to my hometown of Billings, Montana. While always continuing to paint, I also became a mother, and studied massage therapy and healing arts. I currently have a massage and healing practice called Creative Healing, where I do massage, craniosacral, Reiki, and healing arts. I have an in-home art studio in which I spend the vast majority of my evenings, creating my art ;) White Lotus Visions.
Busy with life and raising a child as a single mother, I am primarily a self-taught painter. I haven't had too many opportunities to really devote myself to learning new artistic skills, other than doing my own research, but I am a devoted artist nonetheless and feel this would be a giant leap into a whole new territory! So exciting!!! 
What do I want to do?

SO, I feel one step, for me, in the direction of furthering my art career and ability to render my visions, is to attend an AMAZING seminar in Italy, this July. The seminar is called ""Expanded Visions in the MicshTechnik"". I will be studying with four amazing teachers/artists.....artists who's work I have admired for a long time- Amanda Sage, A.

<p><strong>Our Story</strong></p>
<p>Raices Cultura is a Coachella-based nonprofit organization with a mission to create space for artistic and cultural expression, promote healthy communities, and strengthen the voice of the communities of the Eastern Coachella Valley.  We utilize art as a vehicle for youth empowerment and engage in projects for Dia de los Muertos, the Hue Festival, and the Coachella Music and Art Festival.</p>
<p><strong>What We Are Planning</strong></p>
<p>On Friday, November 1st, 2013 we are planning on bringing the annual Dia de los Muertos celebration to Downtown 6th Street Coachella as a lively street festival experience for the entire Coachella Valley and reimagine the Downtown with massive art installations of calaveras (skulls) and community altars along the street.  The event has outgrown the previous venue, thanks to great community support, and so we think it is time to grow our efforts.  We are looking to utilize Coachella downtown empty storefronts as a showcase for local visual artists and make the downtown come to life at night.  We plan to have performances by local bands, Danza Azteca, Balet Folklorico, and spoken word.  Your contribution will support youth and local artists to implement this vision and demonstrate the power of art and culture to transform downtown Coachella into a empowering community experience.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need</strong></p>
To create this awesome experience and to keep the event rooted in the community, we need your support to reach our fundraising goal of $5,000.  Contributions in any amount are appreciated.  Raices values every community contribution and we have a history of making every dollar that we receive stretch as far as possible.  Your contribution will support the following:
<ul>
<li>8 large altars for display created by local artists and community organizations</li>
<li>4 music bands, Aztec Dancers, Balet Folklorico, and DJ</li>
<li>Support for artists to create 6 main outdoor art installations</li>
<li>Support for artists to create their own showcases in 3 empty storefronts</li>
<li>Craft supplies for special Dia de los Muertos craft tables</li>
<li>Art supplies for Raices artists to fabricate 6 massive Calaveras</li>
<li>Space and equipment rental</li>
<li>Special event permits</li>

Holding that breath, Raine will live in Art Rise Savannah's exhibition space for nine days in order to complete a series of learning and un/learning tasks that have inhibited their ability to become the most realized version of themselves through exhibition and installation art.</span><br/>

</div></div>","Raine Raine is the resident bio-girl/half-birthed alien fetus from The House of Gunt, Savannah’s free-form drag collective whose mission is to connect the trashy with the flashy, the kitschy with the classy, and the hetero-ghosts with a breath of fresh, queer air. Holding that breath, Raine will live in Art Rise Savannah's exhibition space for nine days in order to complete a series of learning and un/learning tasks that have inhibited their ability to become the most realized version of themselves through exhibition and installation art.



Raine will be live-streaming the UN/LEARNING 24/7 on their website, RAINEBLUNK.COM, as a part of a larger social media campaign in congruence with the live UN/LEARNING events. Raine will also be utilizing the Facebook event page as the main catchall for specific programming throughout the nine day intervention. Raine will also be collaborating with artists locally and remotely to produce a fully interactive installation and performance space that fuses necessary daily function with fully aware self-understanding and productivity through outward expression. 


The cultivation of this binging/purging experience will occur during the closing event on January 9th, where Raine will emerge from their self-built womb after three hours of rumination and subconscious self-actualization followed by the final un/learning task, the cutting of all ties to the created work. 
For a full schedule of all the Official Tasks and UN/LEARNINGs, visit: RAINEBLUNK.COM/UN-LEARNING.
   What Raine Needs Raine will be splitting the funding three ways: 
FOOD - Raine will need nine days of food + food for two UN/LEARNINGs (CASH ONLY + ORDERING CHINESE TAKEOUT)
SUPPLIES - Raine needs to purchase/find/rent some physical supplies. (For a full list, see ""Other Ways You Can Help"")
TRAVEL - Raine is planning to take UN/LEARNING on the road after the installation closes. They will spend money on traveling to Atlanta, Baltimore/DC, New York, and Boston at the end of January - early February.
    The Impact Raine will leave the UN/LEARNING as a fully-realized version of themselves with nine days of self-recorded and documented work as evidence.
Collaborators and contributors will become an integral part of Raine's UN/LEARNING process. Both will receive artifacts from the UN/LEARNINGs. 
    Risks & Challenges Some of the UN/LEARNING tasks might change according to the nature of the exhibition. All tasks will result in physical artifacts for sale, display and burning at the final UN/LEARNING on January 9th.

Ranging from t-shirts to custom tote bags, Top Shop swag to original artworks, Geometry handbags to Rossmore jewelry, Lucian Matis homeware to the Everlane Petra bag (currently Angelina Jolie's handbag of choice!) and more, our perks were designed to entice donations at all levels, and to reflect how grateful we are for your support.  The ImpactWe selected Delisle Youth Services as our beneficiary because of their wide-ranging support for Toronto youth, emphasis on the arts, and longstanding LGBTQ support. Their services include: counselling, in-school and day-treatment programs, a group
home, an LGBTQ youth program and support group for parents, a drop-in arts studio and youth art gallery, and
residential case management for teens with complex special needs. With your help, In Bloom can provide Delisle with resources that will allow them to continue to make significant and measurable differences in the lives of Toronto teens.  Other Ways You Can HelpSpread the word! We know not everyone can contribute to this initiative with money. Sharing this link and the link to our website (www.inbloomtoronto.com) will help us tremendously. Together, we can pull off a high-level arts show and a successful benefit concert, and contribute to an invaluable resource for Toronto youth.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>My name is Holly Murphy and I am one of the very few potters left in what was once the pottery capital of the world, Zanesville Ohio. Our community was once a rich, vibrant, thriving area surrounded by family potteries. Unfortunately, thanks to politics, most of them had been sold out and the labor was moved to China.</p>
<p>About three years ago, I fell in love with clay and have been obsessed with it ever since. I was lucky enough to find an amazing teacher and friend who has taught me everything she knows. (she had lost her family pottery years ago)</p>
<p>Im 41 years old and recently divorced. I have two amazing little girls, Sedona, age 5 and Hadley, age 4. I am so happy that ive finally found something that im really good at, and Im proud to call myself an artist. Both of my daughters have shown a big interest in what mommy does and they work by my side quite often. I have always been heavily involved in the tattoo subculture. Sporting two full sleeves, I at one time researched tattoo styled kitchen ware and home decor online and sadly, found nothing. Merging two of my favorite things, Id like to be able to offer tattoo styled pottery, home decor, and kitchen ware to the public to decorate their homes. Finding a lack of such items leaves me with no competition and the ability to fufill a great need. The line will be labeled ""Inked Earth."" (thanks Joleen, for the name!)</p>
<p>Ive been supporting my little family of 3 with my pottery and I would very much like to continue doing that. If youd like to see what Ive been up to... <a href=""http://www.lotsapotsa.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.lotsapotsa.com</a></p>
<p>Pottery is an expensive job. Supplies and equipment cost an arm and a leg these days. When I first started, I got lucky and a neighbor was selling a used kiln. It is small and very old but works! The elements and switches are starting to go out and isnt heating correctly. Also, due to its size, I am quite limited on the size of my pieces. Since it isnt working very well these days, i find myself throwing away alot of my work. Its a huge drain on resources and not to mention FRUSTRATING!</p>
<p>This funding would provide me with a larger, more efficient kiln. This would allow me to be more productive with my time and materials, and it would also be easier on my electric bill!</p>
<p>Another thing a new kiln would allow me to do is teach. There are many people in the area, including children who need a place to learn about pottery and cultivate their skills. This is exactly what our area needs so we can try to bring back at least a little bit of the areas lost pottery heritage. If the funding goes over my asking amount, Id like to buy a test kiln to properly test glazing techniques, and possibly an extruder.</p>
<p>thank you!!</p>

My passion has always been earth: listen to it, cultivate it, protect it, respect it…and shaping it has become my job. In 2004 in fact, I obtained my diploma as ceramist with specialization in potter’s wheel in Tuscany, near Florence, and ever since I am LaVasaia.</p><p>My home and laboratory are in Pralungo, in the north-west of Italy. Not far from there, within the Ricetto di Candelo, a medieval jewel of the XIII century, you can find “La Cantina del Panpepato”, where I display my pieces of pottery. Give a look at my site to have an idea about what I do ( <i><a href=""http://www.lavasaia.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.lavasaia.com</a> </i>). I live at the foot of wonderful mountains, which continuously inspire me through their shapes and colors. Pottery is a menial art and I feel like honouring it, especially when I create simple objects, for a daily purpose, even trying to increase their value using the contrast between the bright glaze and the opaque clay.</p><p>Earth has a lot to teach us, but we have to learn to listen to it. I work, make attempts, test, play and dare…I use types of clay such as majolica or soft crockery firing at low temperatures, around 1830°F, because my kiln cannot reach higher temperatures. However, I feel in a more compelling way the necessity to widen my technical possibilities, to give vent to the ideas that have far-back been coming up to my mind, without any limitation in materials. It is very important to me now getting to work with porcelain, both for my creative and professional life. That’s why I need an high temperature kiln.</p><p>Here comes to life my crowdfunding project ""Bianco Porcellana"": a new earth to keep on cultivating my timeless passion! Among the first creations my hands are looking forward to creating, is coupling porcelain pure white with other natural elements: the metal that will embrace mugs and small cups, or the wood that will become cap or lid for new jars or, also, the wool that will inspire me for new textures on surfaces. There are many new objects I would like to pop out! I just need your help to begin!</p><p>The first indispensable step to take to lead this new adventure off is, of course, the purchase of an high temperature kiln, able to reach about 2370°F. Many are the models for choosing among, but my eyes have laid on a type finished in Germany: 200 liters, 11 KW, resistors on three sides; so, a 660 pounds robust fellow!</p><p>Perfect to begin, but very expensive: 6000€. The price includes a computer for firing programmes and a kit of fire-resistant plates.</p><p>If you help me to buy it, I promise it will work hard!</p><p>Give a look at the rewards I prepared for you: if you like them but, most of all, if you want to share the emotion of clay transformation, make a donation and you will have a happy potter! </p><p>Thank you for your supporting  this campaing. I will appreciate  if you will share with your friends!</p><p>PASS THE WORD !!!</p><p></p><p><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/lavasaia?ref=hl"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/lavasaia?ref=hl</a></p><p></p><p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b><br/></b></p><h2 style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Perks:</b></h2><p style=""font-weight: bold;"">Important!

E’ un patto virtuoso.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p><p style=""display: inline !important;"">Queste caratteristiche fondamentali dovrebbero essere la base per tornare a creare un senso di comunità, un senso creativo autentico svincolato dalle solite leggi commerciali che aiutano solo ciò che è già avviato e un senso di cooperazione per rendere reale una bella idea. </p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Infatti non sono mai le idee a mancare ma i soldi per realizzarle! E questa non deve essere la condizione principale per abbandonare i propri sogni. </span><p>Poter scegliere che progetto far crescere, poter seguire un artigiano nella creazione, poter aspettare i frutti del lavoro in cui si crede, essere mecenati di qualcuno: ecco il senso per chi aiuta a finanziare, anche con poco, il sogno. L’unione fa la forza.<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p><p style=""display: inline !important;"">Quindi siate curiosi! Volete aiutarmi in questa avventura?</p><p></p><p><b><br/></b></p><h2><b>IL PROGETTO</b></h2><p>Ciao a tutti! Sono Francesca.</p><p>La mia passione da sempre è la terra: ascoltarla, coltivarla, proteggerla, rispettarla… e modellarla è diventato il mio lavoro. Nel 2004 infatti ho conseguito il diploma da ceramista con specializzazione tornio in Toscana a Montelupo Fiorentino, vicino a Firenze, e da allora sono LaVasaia.</p><p>Casa e laboratorio si trovano a Pralungo, in Piemonte. Poco lontano, all’interno del Ricetto di Candelo, un gioiello medioevale del XIII secolo, potete trovare “la Cantina del Panpepato”, dove espongo le mie ceramiche. Vivo alle pendici di splendide montagne che mi regalano in continuazione forme e colori a cui ispirarmi. Trovo che la ceramica sia principalmente un’arte umile, che cerco di omaggiare realizzando soprattutto oggetti d’uso quotidiano uniti ad uno studio formale e cromatico sempre nuovo sfruttando il contrasto tra il lucido dello smalto e l’opaco della terra. Date un’occhiata al mio sito per farvi un’idea di come lavoro <a href=""http://www.lavasaia.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.lavasaia.com</a></p><p>La terra ha molto da insegnare, ma bisogna imparare ad ascoltarla. Lavoro, sperimento, gioco, oso… ho sempre utilizzato argille come la maiolica o la terraglia tenera che cuociono a bassa (si fa per dire) temperatura, intorno ai 1000°C. Ora sento però, in maniera sempre più pressante, la necessità di ampliare le mie capacità tecniche, di dare libero sfogo alle idee che mi danno la caccia da tempo senza limitazioni di materiali. Arrivare a lavorare la porcellana è per me adesso molto importante, sia per la mia vita creativa che professionale, e per questo mi serve un forno ad alta temperatura.</p><p>Da qui l’idea di iniziare questo progetto di Crowdfunding: “<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Bianco Porcellana - </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">White Porcelain”: una terra nuova per coltivare la passione di sempre! Sono moltissime le idee che le mie mani non vedono l’ora di realizzare abbinando il bianco puro della porcellana ad altri elementi naturali: il metallo che andrà ad abbracciare tazze e tazzine, il legno che diverrà tappo o coperchio per nuovi barattoli o la lana che servirà da ispirazione per nuove texture sulle superfici. Tanti sono gli oggetti che vorrei sfornare! Mi serve solo il vostro aiuto per cominciare!</span></p><p>Il primo passo obbligatorio per dare il via a questa avventura è, naturalmente, l’acquisto di un forno ad alta temperatura che possa cioè raggiungere circa i 1300°C. Tra i modelli su cui il mio sguardo si è posato ce n'è uno di ottima fattura tedesca: 200 litri, 11Kw e resistenze sui tre lati… insomma un bel ragazzotto da 300 Kg!!!</p><p>Perfetto, ma molto costoso: 6000 euro. Nel prezzo sono inclusi una centralina elettronica per programmare le temperature e un kit di piastre in refrattario.</p><p>Prometto che se mi aiuterete a comprarlo lo farò lavorare sodo!!!</p><p>Date uno sguardo alle ricompense che ho preparato per voi; se vi piacciono, ma soprattutto se volete condividere con me l’emozione dei sogni che si trasformano in terra, fate una donazione e contribuirete ad avere una ceramista felice! Grazie!!!</p><p>Grazie per il supporto alla mia campagna!

My passion has always been earth: listen to it, cultivate it, protect it, respect it…and shaping it has become my job. In 2004 in fact, I obtained my diploma as ceramist with specialization in potter’s wheel in Tuscany, near Florence, and ever since I am LaVasaia.My home and laboratory are in Pralungo, in the north-west of Italy. Not far from there, within the Ricetto di Candelo, a medieval jewel of the XIII century, you can find “La Cantina del Panpepato”, where I display my pieces of pottery. Give a look at my site to have an idea about what I do ( www.lavasaia.com ). I live at the foot of wonderful mountains, which continuously inspire me through their shapes and colors. Pottery is a menial art and I feel like honouring it, especially when I create simple objects, for a daily purpose, even trying to increase their value using the contrast between the bright glaze and the opaque clay.Earth has a lot to teach us, but we have to learn to listen to it. I work, make attempts, test, play and dare…I use types of clay such as majolica or soft crockery firing at low temperatures, around 1830°F, because my kiln cannot reach higher temperatures. However, I feel in a more compelling way the necessity to widen my technical possibilities, to give vent to the ideas that have far-back been coming up to my mind, without any limitation in materials. It is very important to me now getting to work with porcelain, both for my creative and professional life. That’s why I need an high temperature kiln.Here comes to life my crowdfunding project ""Bianco Porcellana"": a new earth to keep on cultivating my timeless passion! Among the first creations my hands are looking forward to creating, is coupling porcelain pure white with other natural elements: the metal that will embrace mugs and small cups, or the wood that will become cap or lid for new jars or, also, the wool that will inspire me for new textures on surfaces. There are many new objects I would like to pop out! I just need your help to begin!The first indispensable step to take to lead this new adventure off is, of course, the purchase of an high temperature kiln, able to reach about 2370°F. Many are the models for choosing among, but my eyes have laid on a type finished in Germany: 200 liters, 11 KW, resistors on three sides; so, a 660 pounds robust fellow!Perfect to begin, but very expensive: 6000€. The price includes a computer for firing programmes and a kit of fire-resistant plates.If you help me to buy it, I promise it will work hard!Give a look at the rewards I prepared for you: if you like them but, most of all, if you want to share the emotion of clay transformation, make a donation and you will have a happy potter! Thank you for your supporting  this campaing. I will appreciate  if you will share with your friends!PASS THE WORD !!!https://www.facebook.com/lavasaia?ref=hlPerks:Important!

E’ un patto virtuoso.Queste caratteristiche fondamentali dovrebbero essere la base per tornare a creare un senso di comunità, un senso creativo autentico svincolato dalle solite leggi commerciali che aiutano solo ciò che è già avviato e un senso di cooperazione per rendere reale una bella idea. Infatti non sono mai le idee a mancare ma i soldi per realizzarle! E questa non deve essere la condizione principale per abbandonare i propri sogni. Poter scegliere che progetto far crescere, poter seguire un artigiano nella creazione, poter aspettare i frutti del lavoro in cui si crede, essere mecenati di qualcuno: ecco il senso per chi aiuta a finanziare, anche con poco, il sogno. L’unione fa la forza.Quindi siate curiosi! Volete aiutarmi in questa avventura?IL PROGETTOCiao a tutti! Sono Francesca.La mia passione da sempre è la terra: ascoltarla, coltivarla, proteggerla, rispettarla… e modellarla è diventato il mio lavoro. Nel 2004 infatti ho conseguito il diploma da ceramista con specializzazione tornio in Toscana a Montelupo Fiorentino, vicino a Firenze, e da allora sono LaVasaia.Casa e laboratorio si trovano a Pralungo, in Piemonte. Poco lontano, all’interno del Ricetto di Candelo, un gioiello medioevale del XIII secolo, potete trovare “la Cantina del Panpepato”, dove espongo le mie ceramiche. Vivo alle pendici di splendide montagne che mi regalano in continuazione forme e colori a cui ispirarmi. Trovo che la ceramica sia principalmente un’arte umile, che cerco di omaggiare realizzando soprattutto oggetti d’uso quotidiano uniti ad uno studio formale e cromatico sempre nuovo sfruttando il contrasto tra il lucido dello smalto e l’opaco della terra. Date un’occhiata al mio sito per farvi un’idea di come lavoro www.lavasaia.comLa terra ha molto da insegnare, ma bisogna imparare ad ascoltarla. Lavoro, sperimento, gioco, oso… ho sempre utilizzato argille come la maiolica o la terraglia tenera che cuociono a bassa (si fa per dire) temperatura, intorno ai 1000°C. Ora sento però, in maniera sempre più pressante, la necessità di ampliare le mie capacità tecniche, di dare libero sfogo alle idee che mi danno la caccia da tempo senza limitazioni di materiali. Arrivare a lavorare la porcellana è per me adesso molto importante, sia per la mia vita creativa che professionale, e per questo mi serve un forno ad alta temperatura.Da qui l’idea di iniziare questo progetto di Crowdfunding: “Bianco Porcellana - White Porcelain”: una terra nuova per coltivare la passione di sempre! Sono moltissime le idee che le mie mani non vedono l’ora di realizzare abbinando il bianco puro della porcellana ad altri elementi naturali: il metallo che andrà ad abbracciare tazze e tazzine, il legno che diverrà tappo o coperchio per nuovi barattoli o la lana che servirà da ispirazione per nuove texture sulle superfici. Tanti sono gli oggetti che vorrei sfornare! Mi serve solo il vostro aiuto per cominciare!Il primo passo obbligatorio per dare il via a questa avventura è, naturalmente, l’acquisto di un forno ad alta temperatura che possa cioè raggiungere circa i 1300°C. Tra i modelli su cui il mio sguardo si è posato ce n'è uno di ottima fattura tedesca: 200 litri, 11Kw e resistenze sui tre lati… insomma un bel ragazzotto da 300 Kg!!!Perfetto, ma molto costoso: 6000 euro. Nel prezzo sono inclusi una centralina elettronica per programmare le temperature e un kit di piastre in refrattario.Prometto che se mi aiuterete a comprarlo lo farò lavorare sodo!!!Date uno sguardo alle ricompense che ho preparato per voi; se vi piacciono, ma soprattutto se volete condividere con me l’emozione dei sogni che si trasformano in terra, fate una donazione e contribuirete ad avere una ceramista felice!

THANK YOU  for getting me this far! As you can see, the campaign has progressed well, and this campaign has generated lots of excellent contributions from artists, friends and patrons alike. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">People are streaming in and are loving the new gallery. It is airy, filled with light, and provides space for our artists' work to be displayed with great pride and beauty.</span><p><br/>Now, we are seeking a final boost in the final week of our campaign, which ends Jan. 11. We still need you! For those who have not yet contributed, please consider joining this extraordinary community effort on behalf of art, artists and small business. For those who have generously contributed, thank you. If you are inspired and able, please consider a final contribution.  </p><p>Obviously this was a very ambitious goal for a very ambitious project. I am stunned with the enthusiasm that has come with contributions large and small. If we can further close the gap by Jan. 11, this will have been a terrific success.</p><p>Good faith has been at the core of this effort: Various contractors and vendors agreed to delay being paid while the campaign has been going. Many of the gallery's artists have contributed ""perks"" to contributors at various levels, along with other heavy lifting and business support for the move.<br/><br/>For instance, sculptor Joe Wheaton, whose work I have carried for years, created both of the videos for the Indiegogo campaign, helped with construction and offered his gourmet chef skills as a ""perk."" For a $1,500 gift, one contributor will receive a gourmet homemade Thai dinner for 12, at the galley, prepared by Wheaton. The dinner was among the first ""perks"" to go!<br/><br/>""Part of what makes this, the Berkshires, a great community is that people are willing to take risks,"" said Wheaton. ""Lauren's risk is going to benefit me and a lot of other hard-working artists who already now have much better exposure. And the community will benefit from this wonderful new gallery.""</p><p>It's not over yet: While we are up and running, we have relocation costs to pay, and with your final push, we can get closer to the ultimate goal.</p><p>In the meantime, come in, have a look, say hi. Tell your friends we’re here at 25 Railroad Street in Great Barrington, selling great art and providing top-notch fine art framing services.<br/></p><p><br/></p><p></p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""></h3><p></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; letter-spacing: 0.06em;""></span></p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Let's Move the Gallery<br/>

<p>I
am Lauren  Clark, owner of Lauren Clark Fine Art, a successful gallery and
frame shop in the lovely village of Housatonic, Massachusetts. In my 21 years
as a gallery owner and framing expert, I have devoted my professional life to representing the
work of hundreds of talented international and regional artists. I have framed
thousands of paintings, photographs and other work for artists and art clients.
I am a professional paper marbler of more than 30 years, with substantial success
in this field. I have enjoyed what every business owner longs for: dedicated, loyal and supportive clientele who keep coming back.<br/></p>
<p>I
am so proud of the business I have built and grateful to the artists and
clients who choose to work with me. <span>They
are my inspiration every day, and I am now poised to celebrate their work in
bigger and better ways. <br/></span></p>
<p></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><b>THE CHALLENGE! <span style=""line-height: 1.45em; letter-spacing: 0.06em;"">THE GOAL!</span></b></p><p></p><p>
The bright blue Park Street building where I have leased my gallery is being sold. I must move my entire operation and the work of my gifted artists and crafts professionals--among them Bart Arnold, Daniel Bellow, Richard Britell, Julio Granda, Liz Kinder, Geoffrey Moss, Terry Wise, and Joe Wheaton, to name a few. <br/></p><p><b>The good news:</b> I have secured a new, 3,000-square-foot space at 25 Railroad Street in nearby downtown Great Barrington, the old Gatsby's. Great Barrington is a true hot spot, featured recently in an MSNBC news profile and named THE top small town in the U.S. by Smithsonian Magazine. I have been able to establish a modest presence already in my new space on Railroad Street, to take advantage of the holiday season while closing my old gallery. But there remains much work to be done at significant expense, and several contractors have agreed to await compensation while this campaign takes place.

<p></p></div>","UPDATE JANUARY 5, 2014Check out the new video: ""Let's Close the Deal""So, here’s the deal: The gallery is  finally here in the new space at 25 Railroad Street and it's fantastic! THANK YOU  for getting me this far! As you can see, the campaign has progressed well, and this campaign has generated lots of excellent contributions from artists, friends and patrons alike. People are streaming in and are loving the new gallery. It is airy, filled with light, and provides space for our artists' work to be displayed with great pride and beauty.Now, we are seeking a final boost in the final week of our campaign, which ends Jan. 11. We still need you! For those who have not yet contributed, please consider joining this extraordinary community effort on behalf of art, artists and small business. For those who have generously contributed, thank you. If you are inspired and able, please consider a final contribution.  Obviously this was a very ambitious goal for a very ambitious project. I am stunned with the enthusiasm that has come with contributions large and small. If we can further close the gap by Jan. 11, this will have been a terrific success.Good faith has been at the core of this effort: Various contractors and vendors agreed to delay being paid while the campaign has been going. Many of the gallery's artists have contributed ""perks"" to contributors at various levels, along with other heavy lifting and business support for the move.For instance, sculptor Joe Wheaton, whose work I have carried for years, created both of the videos for the Indiegogo campaign, helped with construction and offered his gourmet chef skills as a ""perk."" For a $1,500 gift, one contributor will receive a gourmet homemade Thai dinner for 12, at the galley, prepared by Wheaton. The dinner was among the first ""perks"" to go!""Part of what makes this, the Berkshires, a great community is that people are willing to take risks,"" said Wheaton. ""Lauren's risk is going to benefit me and a lot of other hard-working artists who already now have much better exposure. And the community will benefit from this wonderful new gallery.""It's not over yet: While we are up and running, we have relocation costs to pay, and with your final push, we can get closer to the ultimate goal.In the meantime, come in, have a look, say hi. Tell your friends we’re here at 25 Railroad Street in Great Barrington, selling great art and providing top-notch fine art framing services.Let's Move the Gallery

work of hundreds of talented international and regional artists. I have framed
thousands of paintings, photographs and other work for artists and art clients.
I am a professional paper marbler of more than 30 years, with substantial success
in this field. I have enjoyed what every business owner longs for: dedicated, loyal and supportive clientele who keep coming back.
I
am so proud of the business I have built and grateful to the artists and
clients who choose to work with me. They
are my inspiration every day, and I am now poised to celebrate their work in
bigger and better ways. 
THE CHALLENGE! THE GOAL!
The bright blue Park Street building where I have leased my gallery is being sold. I must move my entire operation and the work of my gifted artists and crafts professionals--among them Bart Arnold, Daniel Bellow, Richard Britell, Julio Granda, Liz Kinder, Geoffrey Moss, Terry Wise, and Joe Wheaton, to name a few. The good news: I have secured a new, 3,000-square-foot space at 25 Railroad Street in nearby downtown Great Barrington, the old Gatsby's. Great Barrington is a true hot spot, featured recently in an MSNBC news profile and named THE top small town in the U.S. by Smithsonian Magazine. I have been able to establish a modest presence already in my new space on Railroad Street, to take advantage of the holiday season while closing my old gallery. But there remains much work to be done at significant expense, and several contractors have agreed to await compensation while this campaign takes place. For their trust, confidence and community spirit, I am so very grateful!Even better news: In support of ""Let's Move the Gallery"" many of my loyal gallery artists are enthusiastically contributing ""incentive art"" as perks to contributors at various levels. From a Richard Britell original painting to pottery by Daniel Bellow and gallery evening dinner for 12 by chef-artist Joe Wheaton and art cards by Ann Getsinger -- along with many others -- these perks will delight you. Please take a look at what they have to offer!You can help: Friends, neighbors, clients, other artists, business colleagues and others who are willing to pitch in to help offset the relocation costs and boost the future of Lauren Clark Fine Art and its artists. There's hardly a donation level that doesn't include an art perk: check it out! My immediate costs include:
  Construction, lighting, painting and infrastructure improvements at the new location
  Moving costs and technology updates
  Advertising and marketing to support the launch at the new location 
It's my deepest wish that this campaign be NOT just about Lauren Clark Fine Art, but about its artists and their exceptional work. They are deserving of top-notch representation not just in their gallery owner, but in the gallery itself, and as we know, location means so much. Several remarkable people who have worked to help me launch the ""Let's Move the Gallery Campaign"" and I would like to recognize them and encourage any of you to connect with them professionally:
Joe Wheaton: artist, videography, and site preparation
Ellen Lahr, EGLahr Communications: marketing and PR support
Richard Britell: artist, construction and painting
Dianne Steele: web support at all levels
Dolores Curto: marketing, window design, and enthusiasm
Scott Clark: video music, painting, brotherly love and pie!
Franco Pellegrino: artist and painting and painting and painting...
Thank you in advance for your support and community spirit.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>+I am a poet and educator from Chapel Hill, NC. Growing up outside the rural buffer in Councilville, I was taught that a closed mouth catches no flies; that it was best in most cases if I was seen and not heard. To the people in my life silence meant safety for a boy who’s skin would be the filter through which the world saw him. In elementary school I would find myself listening to the love poems my brother would write to the weeks crush. Immersed in the wordplay, imagery and emotion that would often be accompanied by a doodle of an angel or hearts, I fell in relationship with thought in 2verse.  In high school with the encouragement of my English teacher I would start my own journey as a poet who at that point had only been writing raps and love ballads. Awakened by the freedom I found in verse, I dedicated my life to creating spaces for young people to share their poems, stories and voices running open mics. I am blessed to have co founded an organization called the Sacrificial Poets.+I believe that you must create Art as you enjoy it. Thus, Shots Of MoonShine is a series of seven artbooks. Each of them will be an original poem illustrated by a visual artist or photographer and in some cases, a mixture of the two mediums. In all of my performing and teaching I have never published my own work. As someone who's often a perfectionist much of the hold up has been want to create something I am proud of and to work with other artists. +This will be inspiration for other young brown men I see everyday in classrooms who feel like their stories don't matter. We are a dynamic generation of MoonMen not afraid to speak truth to power!</p>
