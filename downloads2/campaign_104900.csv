Proyecto?</b></h2>
<p>Somos Mariana Foglia (32 años - foto izquierda) y Pablo Defazio (33 años - foto derecha). Nuestro objetivo es lograr la
clasificación a los Juegos Olímpicos Río 2016 en el deporte de Vela y en la
clase Nacra 17. El Nacra 17 es un velero catamarán, categoría mixta elegido
como clase olímpica en el año 2012.  Este
deporte que disfrutamos desde pequeños, hoy lo hemos integrado 100% a nuestra forma de
vida. La Campaña Olímpica que nos proponemos realizar consta de 4 años (2013 a
2016).  ¿Incertidumbres, inseguridades,
planificamos bien o mal?… eran preguntas que solíamos hacernos a diario. Con el paso del tiempo nos dimos cuenta que lo que nos empuja en este sueño es que
creemos en nosotros mismos, y creemos el uno en el otro. Estamos convencidos de que lo vamos a lograr. </p>

<h3>Sí
has leído hasta aquí, quizás esto también te interese!</h3>
<p>Comenzamos
a navegar a los 8 años en Optimist (barco para una persona), en donde comienzan
a navegar los niños, hasta los 15 años. Poco a poco le fuimos tomando gusto a
las competencias y optamos por comenzar a navegar en Snipe (barco de a dos), primero separados y luego
juntos. De allí  provienen nuestros
mayores logros: Pablo ha ganado dos Medallas Panamericanas: plata en 2007 y
bronce en 2011 y fue 3ero. en el mundial de Japón del 2005. Mariana junto a su
hermana, fue bi-campeoana mundial femenina en 2004 y 2006 y 4 veces campeona sudamericana femenina. Juntos, hemos obtenido los títulos de campeones sudamericanos categoría mixto en Paraguay 2002,  campeones nacionales dos veces, 3er. puesto  en el campeonato sudamericano 2013 y fuimos medalla de Oro en los juegos playa de Venezuela 2014. Ambos hemos ganado el
premio al mejor deportista uruguayo, 2005 Mariana y en 2008 Pablo, entregado por el Comité Olímpico Uruguayo. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1042452/files/20141124060135-Presentaci_n3.jpg?1416837695"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; width: 606px; height: 303px; background-color: initial;""/></p>
<p>Pablo ha navegado en más de 25 barcos
diferentes y ha conseguido títulos nacionales, sudamericanos y mundiales en más
de 15 embarcaciones. Además a impulsado el desarrollo del Yachting en Uruguay a través del rol de
entrenador apoyando proyectos nacionales e internacionales de diferentes clases
náuticas como Optimist y Snipe.</p>
<p>Además
de competir, Mariana dedicó parte de su tiempo a ser instructora de Vela, dando clases a adolescentes y adultos en el Yacht Club Punta del Este y tuvo la
oportunidad de trabajar para el Royal Hamilton Amateur Dinghy Yacht Club, en
Bermuda.</p>
<p>También hemos alcanzado algunos logros en Nacra 17, en el sudamericano Brasil 2013 y Juegos Playa de Venezuela 2014, conseguimos dos
terceros puestos. Hoy con la agenda hasta el 2016 planificada buscamos lograr
la clasificación a los Juegos Olímpicos de Río 2016 en Aarhus 2015 (Dinamarca).
</p>
<h2>Riesgos
y desafíos</h2>
<p>La
Campaña Olímpica es un desafió muy grande, siendo 20 el cupo de países que pueden participar en los Juegos Olímpicos en nuestra categoría. Brasil por ser país
organizador ya tiene su lugar dentro de los 20, por lo que restan 19 lugares a disputar. Para lograr representar a nuestro país en RÍO 2016
tenemos que conseguir uno de los 19 cupos para URUGUAY. El formato de clasificación se reparte en 3
Campeonatos diferentes,  la primer fase de clasificación fue en Santander en Setiembre
de 2014 en Mundial de todas la clases Olímpicas de Vela, en el cual se
repartieron los primeros 10 cupos, la próxima etapa de clasificación es en julio 2015 en el mundial de Aarhus (Dinamarca), en el cual se reparten 3 plazas mas.</p>
<p>Luego
restarán 6 cupos más, los cuales se reparten por región y a Sudamérica le
corresponde un de ellos, el cual se disputara en enero del 2016 en MIAMI, USA. </p>
<p>Pensando en el peor escenario, nuestro
mayor riesgo es el de no obtener
el cupo para los Juegos Olímpicos. Pero siendo objetivos y consecuentes con nuestros
planes de entrenamiento, tal como lo venimos haciendo hasta ahora, creemos en
que la clasificación y ese cupo para Uruguay está cada vez más cerca!</p>

<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">The annual campaign being held in 2015, will cost approximately $ 95,000 (US Dollars).  To date we have invested more than US$ 100,000 in the purchase of two boats (one for training in Uruguay and the other to train in Europe); 5 trips to Europe and 3 to Brazil; plus the purchase of boat structure materials (if you want to learn more about our budget, visit our web site at <a href=""http://correo.adinet.com.uy/cp/ps/Mail/ExternalURLProxy?d=adinet.com.uy&amp;u=mfogliacosta&amp;url=http://www.nacra17uru.com&amp;urlHash=1.13733574144779226E18"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://correo.adinet.com.uy/cp/ps/Mail/ExternalURLProxy?d=adinet.com.uy&amp;u=mfogliacosta&amp;url=http://www.nacra17uru.com&amp;urlHash=1.13733574144779226E18"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.nacra17uru.com</a>).  Due to the above expenditures, our financial resources have decreased, and we are looking to raise funds in order to continue participating in training and in the 2015 international competitions.  To achieve our goal, we need to buy Nacra 17 equipment, hire a coach and pay for travel for the competitions.

Quienes somos y cuál es nuestro
Proyecto?
Somos Mariana Foglia (32 años - foto izquierda) y Pablo Defazio (33 años - foto derecha). Nuestro objetivo es lograr la
clasificación a los Juegos Olímpicos Río 2016 en el deporte de Vela y en la
clase Nacra 17. El Nacra 17 es un velero catamarán, categoría mixta elegido
como clase olímpica en el año 2012.  Este
deporte que disfrutamos desde pequeños, hoy lo hemos integrado 100% a nuestra forma de
vida. La Campaña Olímpica que nos proponemos realizar consta de 4 años (2013 a
2016).  ¿Incertidumbres, inseguridades,
planificamos bien o mal?… eran preguntas que solíamos hacernos a diario. Con el paso del tiempo nos dimos cuenta que lo que nos empuja en este sueño es que
creemos en nosotros mismos, y creemos el uno en el otro. Estamos convencidos de que lo vamos a lograr. 



Lo que necesitamos 
La Campaña anual que tendrá lugar en el 2015, tiene un costo de 95000 USD aproximadamente. En lo que va de la campaña, hemos invertido más de 100.000 USD en la compra de dos embarcaciones (una para entrenar en Uruguay y la otra para entrenar en Europa), 5 viajes a Europa y 3 a Brasil, más la compra de materiales estructurales del barco (si deseas conocer más, sobre nuestro presupuesto, visita nuestra web)  www.nacra17uru.com  Con el avance del proyecto, los recursos económicos se nos han ido agotando y por ello estamos
buscando recaudar los fondos que nos permitan continuar participando en los entrenamientos y ciclo de competencias internacionales 2015 del primer semestre. Para ello necesitamos comprar equipamiento para el barco, contratar un entrenador y costear los viajes para las competencias, lo que hace un total de 21000 USD  (Dólares Americanos).

Detalles del monto objetivo: 21000 USD
Equipamiento: 
Juego de Velas:  consiste en 1 Spinnaker (1500 USD), un Foque (1000 USD) y una Mayor (2500 USD) tal como se muestra en el dibujo de abajo.
Entrenador: pasajes aéreos y alojamiento  (6000 USD)
Competencias y Entrenamientos: inscripciones a torneos, alojamiento, traslados y pasajes aéreos  (10000 USD).

Hemos elaborado varias formatos y tipos de recompensas! Todas son especiales y esperamos que te identifiques con alguna! Estamos abiertos a escuchar tus sugerencias!

Sí
has leído hasta aquí, quizás esto también te interese!
Comenzamos
a navegar a los 8 años en Optimist (barco para una persona), en donde comienzan
a navegar los niños, hasta los 15 años. Poco a poco le fuimos tomando gusto a
las competencias y optamos por comenzar a navegar en Snipe (barco de a dos), primero separados y luego
juntos. De allí  provienen nuestros
mayores logros: Pablo ha ganado dos Medallas Panamericanas: plata en 2007 y
bronce en 2011 y fue 3ero. en el mundial de Japón del 2005. Mariana junto a su
hermana, fue bi-campeoana mundial femenina en 2004 y 2006 y 4 veces campeona sudamericana femenina. Juntos, hemos obtenido los títulos de campeones sudamericanos categoría mixto en Paraguay 2002,  campeones nacionales dos veces, 3er. puesto  en el campeonato sudamericano 2013 y fuimos medalla de Oro en los juegos playa de Venezuela 2014. Ambos hemos ganado el
premio al mejor deportista uruguayo, 2005 Mariana y en 2008 Pablo, entregado por el Comité Olímpico Uruguayo. 

Pablo ha navegado en más de 25 barcos
diferentes y ha conseguido títulos nacionales, sudamericanos y mundiales en más
de 15 embarcaciones. Además a impulsado el desarrollo del Yachting en Uruguay a través del rol de
entrenador apoyando proyectos nacionales e internacionales de diferentes clases
náuticas como Optimist y Snipe.
Además
de competir, Mariana dedicó parte de su tiempo a ser instructora de Vela, dando clases a adolescentes y adultos en el Yacht Club Punta del Este y tuvo la
oportunidad de trabajar para el Royal Hamilton Amateur Dinghy Yacht Club, en
Bermuda.
También hemos alcanzado algunos logros en Nacra 17, en el sudamericano Brasil 2013 y Juegos Playa de Venezuela 2014, conseguimos dos
terceros puestos. Hoy con la agenda hasta el 2016 planificada buscamos lograr
la clasificación a los Juegos Olímpicos de Río 2016 en Aarhus 2015 (Dinamarca).

Riesgos
y desafíos
La
Campaña Olímpica es un desafió muy grande, siendo 20 el cupo de países que pueden participar en los Juegos Olímpicos en nuestra categoría. Brasil por ser país
organizador ya tiene su lugar dentro de los 20, por lo que restan 19 lugares a disputar. Para lograr representar a nuestro país en RÍO 2016
tenemos que conseguir uno de los 19 cupos para URUGUAY. El formato de clasificación se reparte en 3
Campeonatos diferentes,  la primer fase de clasificación fue en Santander en Setiembre
de 2014 en Mundial de todas la clases Olímpicas de Vela, en el cual se
repartieron los primeros 10 cupos, la próxima etapa de clasificación es en julio 2015 en el mundial de Aarhus (Dinamarca), en el cual se reparten 3 plazas mas.
Luego
restarán 6 cupos más, los cuales se reparten por región y a Sudamérica le
corresponde un de ellos, el cual se disputara en enero del 2016 en MIAMI, USA. 
Pensando en el peor escenario, nuestro
mayor riesgo es el de no obtener
el cupo para los Juegos Olímpicos. Pero siendo objetivos y consecuentes con nuestros
planes de entrenamiento, tal como lo venimos haciendo hasta ahora, creemos en
que la clasificación y ese cupo para Uruguay está cada vez más cerca!

<p>Welcome to our PRISONHOOD campaign page! Thanks for taking the time to learn more about us and this project. My name is Robert Hayes. I am founder and CEO of Fei Hu Interactive. We have been developing PRISONHOOD for many months now with the aim to entertain and delight as many folks as we possibly can.</p>
<p>In this process, there have been good days and bad days. And now, we are incredibly close to delivering a truly unique and fantastic (game) experience to folks all over the world. I am so proud of what we have been able to achieve. But to make our vision a viable long-term proposition, I ask for your support. With your help, we will be able to complete our development efforts; maintain and support the game once it has launched; and market the game to folks worldwide. The information below is intended to tell more about our plans. I hope you find it informative and helpful as you consider extending your support to us.</p>
<p><img alt=""What is Prisonhood"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.feihuinteractive.com/indie/banner_whatisprisonhood.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""What is Prisonhood""/></p>
<p>PRISONHOOD is a social free-to-play game that blends role playing game (RPG) elements with task management and mini-games all inspired by the daily challenges of life in prison. PRISONHOOD introduces players to the ruthless world of prison life, complete with edgy challenges, and ruthless characters set in a wickedly fun cartoon style environment. PRISONHOOD features a unique ‘prison-theme’ game setting and challenges you to build your reputation from rookie to lifer. Select from four cool and stylish avatars as you recruit, extort, brawl, buy, sell, and steal your way through over thirty locations as you strive to reach the top. <br/><br/>PRISONHOOD features over ninety edgy and fun in-game tasks along with three topical yet casual mini-games. The game includes many social features that let you brawl against friend or foe in the “Dog Pound”, and bet against friend or foe in “The Ring”, and if you cannot beat them, then join them by sharing in-game items. <br/><br/>PRISONHOOD will be available on iPhone, iPad and Android devices as well as Facebook. The game will also be available in multiple languages, including English, French, Italian, German, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, Russian, Turkish, Japanese, Korean, and simplified Chinese. PRISONHOOD is scheduled to debut in April 2013.<img alt=""Prisonhood Screenshots1"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.feihuinteractive.com/indie/screens1.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/><img alt=""Prisonhood Description"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.feihuinteractive.com/indie/banner_prisonhooddescriptio.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>You are a bad guy. You’re a guilty guy. And now you’re locked-up for 15-plus years with little chance of parole. Sure, you can try to attribute your social deviance to an unfortunate upbringing. You know the story: a single-working mother; an absent father; and stuck in a low-income housing project on the wrong-side of town. But this was not your story. You come from an ordinary yet loving and supportive middle-class family. By all accounts, you had the foundations to distinguish right-from-wrong and good-from-bad. Sometime between surviving high school and a series of bad decisions, you found yourself on the wrong-side of the law. It did not need to go this way for you; but it did. Eventually, the law caught-up to you. And it was a swift process from hands behind-your-head to we find the defendant guilty on all counts. This is the story of PRISONHOOD. You enter prison as a rookie. And somehow-someway, you need to emerge as a boss. But you’re smart. You understand the rules of the game. You know full-well that you need to comply with the rules and routines established by the correctional system. However, you also know what you need to do in order to survive and maximize your power within the prison hierarchy.   <br/><br/>In PRISONHOOD, you climb through the ranks with an ultimate objective of maximizing your reputation. And in prison, reputation defines who you are and where you stand within the hierarchy.  But reputation is an earned commodity. And you earn reputation by demonstrating to your peers your level of power, which takes many forms, including physical, psychological, economic, and more. But against this backdrop, you’re still a prisoner who needs to live by the rules and routines that govern the prison – but even this aspect of prison life helps your reputation, albeit modestly. This is the high-level challenge structure of PRISONHOOD. You will face the challenges by completing a combination tasks, mini-games and intense social interactions. And when you complete the specified line-up activities, you advance to the next level and earn rewards, including rank, reputation, cash, chips, and more. PRISONHOOD features 25 levels; over 90 prison-themed tasks; 3 topical yet casual mini-games; 30 different prison facilities; 4 different avatars to choose from; and over 30 different inmate and prison guard NPCs. In PRISONHOOD, reputation has a heavy price!<br/><br/><img alt=""Unique Game Features"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.feihuinteractive.com/indie/banner_usps.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Prisonhood includes many appealing features that we know you will love, below is just a sample of what you will be able to enjoy in the full game:</p>
<p>- Unique prison-theme and setting<br/>- Clever and in-depth causal game featuring RPG elements<br/>- Select from 4 cool and stylish avatars <br/>- Complete more than 90 topical and edgy in-game tasks<br/>- Play 3 fun mini-games featuring intuitive and casual game mechanics<br/>- Fight against friend or foe in an outright brawl in the Dog Pound<br/>- Enter The Ring and bet against friends where it’s bicep-to-bicep in high-stakes arm wrestling <br/>- Recruit and manage your restless yet useful prison gang</p>

<p>The development team at Fei Hu are gamers, and are working tirelessly to deliver one of the most unique and engaging social free to play games that has ever been developed. PRISONHOOD has found its inspiration in the shady side of prison life and cleverly incorporates the social experience with in-game challenges, task management, distinctive mini-games and exciting PVP elements. Players in PRISONHOOD will experience life behind bars through a large range of diverse locations, while completing over 90 tasks as they progress through the ranks from rookie to lifer. <br/><br/>PRISONHOOD blends role-playing; social and casual gaming elements in a cartoon style to create a unique game that we believe will appeal to core and casual players.<br/><br/>We love PRISONHOOD and we hope you will to.</p>

<p><br/><img alt=""Funding Goal and Use of Proceeds"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.feihuinteractive.com/indie/banner_fundinggoal.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Our goal is to raise US$50,000 – with a stretch goal of US$100,000. We plan to use the proceeds from your support in the following ways: <br/><br/>- <strong>Development of PRISONHOOD on Android:</strong> We are nearly finished with the iOS version of PRISONHOOD; however we plan to bring PRISONHOOD to Android devices as well. To do this, we need to incur additional engineering and testing costs. It’s not rocket science, but it takes time and resources to get it done.        <br/> <br/>- <strong>Development of PRISONHOOD on Facebook:</strong> Our cross-platform strategy is intended to maximize awareness, discovery, reach, and relevance. For this reason, we aim to go beyond just mobile and deploy PRISONHOOD on Facebook. To do this, we need to invest in supplemental engineering and art resources.  <br/> <br/>- <strong>First scheduled update of PRISONHOOD after the launch of the game:</strong> The clock really starts once we launch PRISONHOOD. Fans will demand new features as well as discover issues that need to be fixed. We need to be prepared. In our first update, we plan to design and implement new levels and features; introduce new and colorful characters; and repair any identified and/or reported issues and bugs. We plan to make our first update to PRISONHOOD within the first four weeks of launch. <br/> <br/>- <strong>Establishment of a product services infrastructure:</strong> Beyond the first scheduled update of PRISONHOOD, we plan to set-up and maintain a dedicated product services team who will manage PRISONHOOD from a post-production point-of-view. This team’s primary objective is to add more value to PRISONHOOD (through new features, levels, characters, etc.) as well as to provide ongoing maintenance services.<br/><br/><img alt=""Why Contribute to Prisonhood"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.feihuinteractive.com/indie/banner_whysupportprisonhood.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We are totally excited about PRISONHOOD. Inspired by the rise of prison related references in popular culture, we believe PRISONHOOD provides an excellent backdrop to develop fun gameplay, colorful characters, topical narrative, and endless dramatizations and exaggerations of prison life. Moreover, we believe PRISONHOOD has obvious global appeal in the sense that prison is a universal concept in which consumer expectations and perceptions are largely aligned. <br/><br/>Funding PRISONHOOD is a unique opportunity for anyone with an interest in bringing a game (and brand) to life. We want you to be part of this and to witness PRISONHOOD turn from imagination into reality. Going forward, we aim to turn PRISONHOOD into a viable global intellectual property – which means there will be more from PRISONHOOD in the future. Accordingly, your support means you are part of something truly grand.</p>

PRISONHOOD is a social free-to-play game that blends role playing game (RPG) elements with task management and mini-games all inspired by the daily challenges of life in prison. PRISONHOOD introduces players to the ruthless world of prison life, complete with edgy challenges, and ruthless characters set in a wickedly fun cartoon style environment. PRISONHOOD features a unique ‘prison-theme’ game setting and challenges you to build your reputation from rookie to lifer. Select from four cool and stylish avatars as you recruit, extort, brawl, buy, sell, and steal your way through over thirty locations as you strive to reach the top. PRISONHOOD features over ninety edgy and fun in-game tasks along with three topical yet casual mini-games. The game includes many social features that let you brawl against friend or foe in the “Dog Pound”, and bet against friend or foe in “The Ring”, and if you cannot beat them, then join them by sharing in-game items. PRISONHOOD will be available on iPhone, iPad and Android devices as well as Facebook. The game will also be available in multiple languages, including English, French, Italian, German, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, Russian, Turkish, Japanese, Korean, and simplified Chinese. PRISONHOOD is scheduled to debut in April 2013.
You are a bad guy. You’re a guilty guy. And now you’re locked-up for 15-plus years with little chance of parole. Sure, you can try to attribute your social deviance to an unfortunate upbringing. You know the story: a single-working mother; an absent father; and stuck in a low-income housing project on the wrong-side of town. But this was not your story. You come from an ordinary yet loving and supportive middle-class family. By all accounts, you had the foundations to distinguish right-from-wrong and good-from-bad. Sometime between surviving high school and a series of bad decisions, you found yourself on the wrong-side of the law. It did not need to go this way for you; but it did. Eventually, the law caught-up to you. And it was a swift process from hands behind-your-head to we find the defendant guilty on all counts. This is the story of PRISONHOOD. You enter prison as a rookie. And somehow-someway, you need to emerge as a boss. But you’re smart. You understand the rules of the game. You know full-well that you need to comply with the rules and routines established by the correctional system. However, you also know what you need to do in order to survive and maximize your power within the prison hierarchy.   In PRISONHOOD, you climb through the ranks with an ultimate objective of maximizing your reputation. And in prison, reputation defines who you are and where you stand within the hierarchy.  But reputation is an earned commodity. And you earn reputation by demonstrating to your peers your level of power, which takes many forms, including physical, psychological, economic, and more. But against this backdrop, you’re still a prisoner who needs to live by the rules and routines that govern the prison – but even this aspect of prison life helps your reputation, albeit modestly. This is the high-level challenge structure of PRISONHOOD. You will face the challenges by completing a combination tasks, mini-games and intense social interactions. And when you complete the specified line-up activities, you advance to the next level and earn rewards, including rank, reputation, cash, chips, and more. PRISONHOOD features 25 levels; over 90 prison-themed tasks; 3 topical yet casual mini-games; 30 different prison facilities; 4 different avatars to choose from; and over 30 different inmate and prison guard NPCs. In PRISONHOOD, reputation has a heavy price!
Prisonhood includes many appealing features that we know you will love, below is just a sample of what you will be able to enjoy in the full game:
- Unique prison-theme and setting- Clever and in-depth causal game featuring RPG elements- Select from 4 cool and stylish avatars - Complete more than 90 topical and edgy in-game tasks- Play 3 fun mini-games featuring intuitive and casual game mechanics- Fight against friend or foe in an outright brawl in the Dog Pound- Enter The Ring and bet against friends where it’s bicep-to-bicep in high-stakes arm wrestling - Recruit and manage your restless yet useful prison gang

Our goal is to raise US$50,000 – with a stretch goal of US$100,000. We plan to use the proceeds from your support in the following ways: - Development of PRISONHOOD on Android: We are nearly finished with the iOS version of PRISONHOOD; however we plan to bring PRISONHOOD to Android devices as well. To do this, we need to incur additional engineering and testing costs. It’s not rocket science, but it takes time and resources to get it done.         - Development of PRISONHOOD on Facebook: Our cross-platform strategy is intended to maximize awareness, discovery, reach, and relevance. For this reason, we aim to go beyond just mobile and deploy PRISONHOOD on Facebook. To do this, we need to invest in supplemental engineering and art resources.   - First scheduled update of PRISONHOOD after the launch of the game: The clock really starts once we launch PRISONHOOD. Fans will demand new features as well as discover issues that need to be fixed. We need to be prepared. In our first update, we plan to design and implement new levels and features; introduce new and colorful characters; and repair any identified and/or reported issues and bugs. We plan to make our first update to PRISONHOOD within the first four weeks of launch.  - Establishment of a product services infrastructure: Beyond the first scheduled update of PRISONHOOD, we plan to set-up and maintain a dedicated product services team who will manage PRISONHOOD from a post-production point-of-view. This team’s primary objective is to add more value to PRISONHOOD (through new features, levels, characters, etc.) as well as to provide ongoing maintenance services.
We are totally excited about PRISONHOOD. Inspired by the rise of prison related references in popular culture, we believe PRISONHOOD provides an excellent backdrop to develop fun gameplay, colorful characters, topical narrative, and endless dramatizations and exaggerations of prison life. Moreover, we believe PRISONHOOD has obvious global appeal in the sense that prison is a universal concept in which consumer expectations and perceptions are largely aligned. Funding PRISONHOOD is a unique opportunity for anyone with an interest in bringing a game (and brand) to life. We want you to be part of this and to witness PRISONHOOD turn from imagination into reality. Going forward, we aim to turn PRISONHOOD into a viable global intellectual property – which means there will be more from PRISONHOOD in the future. Accordingly, your support means you are part of something truly grand.

Thank you so much for visiting our project. We truly appreciate your consideration. We hope you share our enthusiasm for PRISONHOOD. And we hope you find PRISONHOOD deserving of your support. No matter what level, your support counts, and we are grateful for your support. If you have any questions or comments about us or PRISONHOOD, please feel free to contact us anytime.",15.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h4>One of the biggest obstacles facing indie game developers is finding reliable team mates to work on projects with. Many games never see the light of day because the developers are unable to find an Artist, Programmer, Designer, or Musician.</h4>

<h1><b>What is Develteam?</b></h1>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Develteam is a Community for Connecting Indie Game Developers. Beyond the usual features found on communities, such as Forums, Chat, and User-Posted Content, there are specific features built in to assist in Collaboration. Features such as being able to find other developers to work with, post Portfolio Pieces, Participate in Brainstorm Sessions, Chat via Webcam and Mic, Screen Sharing, and Multi-User White Boards and Document Editing. </p>
<p>Develteam has three main goals - To assist Indie Game Devs in:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Connecting</b><p>We have systems in place to <strong>find developers by their skillset</strong>, filtering your options to view only artists, programmers, musicians, sound engineers, writers, producers, or designers.</p>
<p>Part of what helps us connect developers is the ability to <strong>upload your portfolio</strong> pieces to show your work. You can upload images, videos, YouTube clips, audio samples, and other multimedia formats. This helps connect developers, because frankly, who wants to bring someone into their project without knowing what they're capable of? Right now, it isn't uncommon to browse Classifieds forums like those found on tigsource, gamedev.net, and /r/gamedevclassifieds. While these are valid avenues, anyone who has tried to go this route knows that it isn't easy to research all the candidates or find quality help. At Develteam, it's very easy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<b>Communicating</b><p>The site itself has some great features. We have a site-wide <strong>Forums</strong>, a <b>Brainstorming Section</b> to help flesh out ideas, a <strong>General Chatroom</strong> that anyone can access, <strong>Private 1-on-1 Chat</strong>, social network style <strong>Feeds and Walls</strong>, a growing <strong>list of Game Dev Tools and websites with Assets</strong>, a <strong>Private Mail system</strong>, <strong>Notifications</strong>, and more.</p>
<p>Whether you're showing off your personal work, or want to promote a Game you're working on or finished, Develteam makes it easy to give and receive feedback.</p>
</li>
<li>
<b>Collaborating</b><p>Once your team has been assembled, you can <strong>create Game Projects</strong> right there on the site. Your game project will be listed in the browse pages. You can set a flag in the options to declare that you're actively looking for new members to join and what roles you wish to fill. This allows Developers to browse only game projects that are looking for members of a specific discipline. If an artist wants to join a Game Project, he/she can browse an easy to find list of projects that are looking for artists. It couldn't be easier!</p>
<p><strong>Game projects have a variety of tools</strong> at their disposal, including a <strong>Private File Depot</strong>, a <strong>Public Media Library</strong> for showing game assets and so on, <strong>Public and Private Forums</strong>, a<strong>Member Task System</strong> to keep track of what has been and what needs to be done, and a <strong>Private Web-Based Chatroom</strong>.</p>

<h1>Taking Develteam to the Next Level</h1>
<p>The site just is a year old, but has almost a thousand registered users. However, the strength of any online community lies directly in the quality and quantity of users in that community. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Like any online community, more users leads to more users on an exponential scale. The trick is getting to critical mass. Building a community is like rolling a boulder up a hill - it's tough work, but once you reach the top, it rolls down on its own, building speed and power. We believe that Develteam will be greatly successful once that point is reached. However, spreading the word isn't easy - or cheap. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>This campaign is to raise funds to pay for marketing. We are in contact with an amazing marketing group who is excited to promote Develteam and believes in the site. This group wants to help us get the word out there, but of course, they cannot (nor should be expected to) work for free! </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>In addition to the this avenue of marketing, we need funds to promote the site through targeting advertising through Google Adwords, Facebook Ads, and ads on article-based sites related to Indie Game Development.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>If we reach beyond our fund goal and there is money left over, we want to spend this money on the site itself, such as a graphical redesign, faster servers, and architecture optimization.</p>

 infantry assets of both Human and Alien factions. The overall setting of the game is a desperate frontier war in the 25th century, where the Human race is fighting tooth and nail for its place among the stars.</p>

This is our chance to introduce a whole new generation of players to the joy of CRUSHING YOUR ENEMIES HEX BY HEX.</p>
<p><i>Ground Pounders</i> will be enjoyable in both single-player and multi-player 
modes, and will be able to connect players who are playing on different devices. We would like to set the bar for fun, flexible, portable and easy-to-play war games that nonetheless offer some depth, challenge, and re-playability.</p>

Well known for its well-developed alien races and interesting background fiction, the ""Sotsverse"" has been the setting for three popular PC games over the last ten years.</p>
<p> The first installment of the original 4X space strategy game <a href=""http://store.steampowered.com/video/42890/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sword of the Stars</a> was developed independently by Kerberos Productions from 2003-2005 and released in 2006 by Lighthouse Interactive. The game and its universe quickly became a cult classic among 4X gamers with a taste for its strategic and tactical depth, original design, interesting alien races and gripping real-time combat. The initial release was followed from 2006-2009 by three full expansions and a full-length military science fiction novel, <a href=""http://www.amazon.ca/Deacons-Tale-Sword-Stars-ebook/dp/B005WL8QGM"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Deacon's Tale</a>. <br/></p>
<p>A stand-alone 4X strategy sequel, <a href=""http://store.steampowered.com/video/42990/2028168"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sword of the Stars 2: Lords of Winter</a> was released in 2011 by Paradox Interactive. The first expansion for SotS 2, <i>The End of Flesh</i>, was bundled for free with the game to become ""the Enhanced Edition"" of the game in 2012. With the release of the <i>End of Flesh</i> expansion, the SotSverse had grown to host seven playable Imperial Races, each with its own high technology and well-developed interstellar empire, as well as countless smaller independent races, Elder races, and cosmic mysteries. As of September 2013, the SotSverse has produced ten years' worth of concept art and over 200,000 words of background fiction and Lore!<br/></p>
<p>In October of 2012 the developers of <i>Sword of the Stars</i> broke free from the traditional ""publisher/dev"" model of game development and went fully independent for the first time. Kerberos Productions used Indiegogo to crowd-fund their first self-published game. <a href=""http://store.steampowered.com/app/233700/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sword of the Stars: The Pit</a> was a departure from the previous 4X titles of the franchise, a deceptively cute and brutally lethal science fiction roguelike. Set in the underground laboratory of a genocidal bio-weapons genius, <i>The Pit </i>was a single-player rpg which allowed players to experience the chills, thrills, monsters and mayhem of the Sotsverse as never before.</p>
<p>Development of <i>The Pit</i> was completed on schedule and successfully delivered to supporters of the crowd-funding campaign in February 2013. It has since become an indie hit, and the fastest-selling game in the history of the studio. <a href=""http://store.steampowered.com/app/238450/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mind Games</a>,  the first expansion for <i>The Pit</i>, was released in July of 2013 with typical reviews of 8/10 and 9/10.</p>
<p><i><b>Sword of the Stars: Ground Pounders</b></i> will be the second fully independent title developed by Kerberos and crowd-funded via the Indiegogo platform. In <i>Ground Pounders</i>, we're hoping to push the envelope once again and expand the Sotsverse in a new direction, bringing its vibrant high-tech backdrop to the genre of hex-based, turn-based 2D wargaming.<br/></p>

She has worked in the gaming industry since 1994, and contributed background fiction to <i>Homeworld</i>, <i>Homeworld: Cataclysm</i>, <i>Ground Control</i>, and <i>Arcanum: of Steamworks and Magick Obscura</i> before she began working full time at Kerberos. She is the creator of the <i>Sword of the Stars</i> universe and the <i>Fort Zombie</i> universe, and has worked as a designer on <i>Sword of the Stars</i> and its expansions,<i> Fort Zombie</i>, <i>Sword of the Stars 2: Lords of Winter</i>, and <i>Sword of the Stars: The Pit</i>.

In addition to his work on <i>Ground Pounders</i>, he has contributed the majority of 2D art assets for all Kerberos titles since the founding of the studio, including the original <i>Sword of the Stars </i>and all expansions, <i>Fort Zombie</i>, <i>Sword of the Stars 2: Lords of Winter</i>, and <i>Sword of the Stars: The Pit</i>. <br/><br/>(4) <b>Ryan Blanks</b> is a visual artist with extensive experience in both 3D modeling and animation. He began his career by completing the advanced animation course with honors at the University of Victoria, receiving the Excellence in Animation award upon graduation.

He has contributed 3D art and animation to seven Kerberos releases since then, including all three expansions of the original <i>Sword of the Stars</i>, <i>Fort Zombie</i>, both <i>Sword of the Stars 2: Lords of Winter</i>, <i>SotS 2: End of Flesh</i>, and <i>Ground Pounders</i>. <br/><br/>(5) <b>Shane Lazarus</b> is the Intern, Kerberos Messageboard Cleric, tester, maker of breads, associate designer and wargamer of the team. <i>Ground Pounders</i> will be his first game.<br/><br/>(6) <b>James Goldthorpe</b> is a Level 28 Network Wizard!

From then on he launched a merciless grind with little sleep until obtaining the C++ feat, and mastering the dark arcane magics of network engineering. After attending the Guild of Game Development at the Art Institute of Vancouver, he received a party invitation in 2012 from Kerberos Productions. He has since sacrificed many beasts and prayed to foul gods to help give birth to the <i>Sword of the Stars II: End of Flesh</i> expansion. In his spare time, James enjoys lifting heavy iron things and placing them back down, when not casting code.<br/><br/>(7) <b>Darren “Ddub” Waine</b> graduated from SAIT Polytechnic with a degree in Automated Systems Engineering Technologies (which is building, maintaining, and programming robots, for those who don’t know!). He later pursued studies in video game development through The Art Institute of Vancouver.

He worked on <i>Sword of the Stars 2: Lords of Winter</i> and became the Technical Lead of the project during its expansion, <i>Sword of the Stars 2: End of Flesh</i>. He is a highly dedicated member of the team, well loved by Kerberos fans, and tends to work on Centaurian time.<br/><br/>(8) <b>Nick “Nextek” Naso</b> began his career in gaming at the Art Institutes of Vancouver and then went on to create, maintain and lead development of a large game-mod and the resulting community, for a title which shall remain nameless. This included the vast amount of database and security knowledge needed to maintain data for thousands of users–experience which he brought with him to Kerberos when he joined the company as a programmer in 2012, with duties ranging from gameplay programming, tools creation and maintenance, UI programming, to data management and customer support. <i>Ground Pounders</i> is his second Kerberos game, after <i>Sword of the Stars: End of Flesh</i>. <br/><br/>(9) <b>Chris “Degrassi” Gerspacher</b> is the Art Director of <i>Ground Pounders</i> and one of the founding partners of Kerberos Productions.

What we hope to accomplish with your help is to take the game from its current Alpha state to Beta by November 2013, and to have a complete, polished version of the game ready for release by Christmas of this year.<br/><br/>Yes, this is a fast turn-around time! But if we are able to meet our project budget we are aiming for the following features by the end of December:<br/><br/><ul>
<li>Control one of 2 Armies - Human or Hivers</li>
<li>50+ units covering Land, Sea, and Air forces</li>
<li>Battle across alien worlds on exotic battlefields, including airless moons, lava plains, and meteor blasted wastelands</li>
<li>Seize orbital superiority and call down Orbital Bombardment on your foes</li>
<li>Build Airfields, Fortified Areas, and repair/destroy Bridges</li>
<li>Improve your Unit's experience and abilities over 2 Playable Campaigns</li>
<li>Unlock and collect Combat Cards for each playable Race</li>
<li>Build unique Combat Card Decks and tune them for specific Battles</li>
<li>Choose from over 30 Scenarios, playable in Skirmish Mode or Head-to-Head Multi-player Mode</li>
<li>Cross-Platform Support for PC and Android-compatible devices</li>
<li>Create and Trade your own Battles using Scenario and Unit Editors</li>
<li>Enjoy a SotSdex filled with Lore details on famous Units, Personalities, Battles and Weapon Systems<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<b>PLEASE NOTE:</b> the original crowd-funding budget for the <i>Ground Pounders</i> was $42,000, for a development plan that had much more content on release, including an additional playable faction (The Tarkas) and another full campaign, more scenarios possible in all three campaigns, and more units available to all three factions.<br/><br/>If this campaign meets or exceeds the original budget, we will still be very happy to provide all of that content for free to all supporters, as the first ""Stretch Goal"" of the campaign! <br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/100734/files/20130928040340-multiplayer_banner.png?1380366220"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Crushing planets is always fun...but we all know that <b>being able to crush your FRIEND's planet is<i> even better</i></b>.<i><br/><br/></i><p><i>Ground Pounders</i>
 has been designed from the start to be an asynchronous multi-player 
game. This means that play is turn-based, but that you can do your turn 
any time, and your opponent can get back to it any time.</p>
<p>No staring at the screen waiting for your opponent to move in <i>Ground Pounders!</i>
 Just do your turn, and then maybe play some single-player until your 
friend does his turn. The game will let you know when your opponent has 
finished his turn, and it's time for you to play again.</p>
<p>Even better though, <i>Ground Pounders</i> will be multi-player capable across <b>MULTIPLE PLATFORMS</b>! 
 Are you stuck at work with no gaming device but your pad, while your 
friend across the country is already home on his PC?  No problem! <i>Ground Pounders</i>
 will let you play together, regardless of the fact that you're on 
separate platforms.  And you will be able to switch platforms on the go,
 so that when your friend needs to go out for dinner later in the 
evening, he can just switch to his phone-based version of <i>Ground Pounders</i> and continue the game!</p>
<p>Our current plan to to release the game in December for PC and Android-based phones and pads.<b> </b>Would you like to see <i>Ground Pounders</i>
 supported on more platforms? Check out our Stretch Goals! With extra support from you, we'll be able to get the game out for 
Mac, iOS and Linux right away, and everyone who supports the campaign at the Early Bird level or higher will get access to all available platforms for free!</p>
<p align=""left"">If the campaign does not reach its higher Stretch Goals, the process of converting the game to other platforms will be much slower, and we will only be able to offer our supporters the two platforms we have planned for initial release: PC and Android.</p>

Well, a lot of things. Primarily, you get to bring a cool new game into the world and revive a genre which could use some new blood, new ideas, and access to all of the exciting new platforms for turn-based wargames in the modern era.</p>
<p align=""left"">Beyond that, by supporting Kerberos and other truly independent studios, you will be helping to create a better world for all gamers and all developers! Crowd-funding is a healthier, more transparent and more democratic system of game development than all previous models, and although it may not work for every genre and style of game, we believe that it will work extremely well for games that do not need a huge budget to produce a fun, playable product. <br/></p>
<p align=""left"">In addition to the most important Perks, though, we've tried to come up with a variety of reward levels which will offer a good value for supporters on any budget. We've scaled back the budget of the game and the physical items we offer to make the project more economical, but if the campaign does well and people really want them, we can add any Perks that you miss! Please leave us a comment with your suggestions. <br/></p>

Yes we do! Our primary goal for this campaign is very simple, just enough funding to keep the lights on and keep the team working while we take the game to its Beta phase and final phase over the next few months.

<p>Our first Stretch Goal will be to expand the game to include the Tarka, a third playable faction!

<p><b>45K - MAC VERSION!</b><br/><br/>Our second Stretch Goal is to release the Mac and PC versions of Ground Pounders simultaneously.

 science fiction universe. We've launched this project on Indiegogo because we want to make a fun beer-and-pretzels war game, complete with old school hex maps and strategic thinking. Ground Pounders is a game about the armies of the far future, with players controlling high-tech tanks, air craft and
 infantry assets of both Human and Alien factions. The overall setting of the game is a desperate frontier war in the 25th century, where the Human race is fighting tooth and nail for its place among the stars.
Inspired by classic strategy games like Panzer General,
 our ultimate goal is to create a fresh new twist on an old genre which has been neglected for too long by modern developers. Introducing modern mechanics and making the game playable on multiple modern platforms will give this classic strategy form a new lease on life. This is our chance to introduce a whole new generation of players to the joy of CRUSHING YOUR ENEMIES HEX BY HEX.
Ground Pounders will be enjoyable in both single-player and multi-player 
modes, and will be able to connect players who are playing on different devices. We would like to set the bar for fun, flexible, portable and easy-to-play war games that nonetheless offer some depth, challenge, and re-playability.



If you've never played a strategy game like this before, why not see what it's like for free? We've made an Alpha Demo of Ground Pounders which features the game's Tutorial and should give you a pretty good idea of how the basic mechanics will work. Please feel free to download the PC version of the Alpha Demo from Gamer's Hell and the Android version of the Alpha Demo at the Google store, and give them a try! Then come back and help us finish the game!

Sword of the Stars is a space opera universe created by Kerberos Productions. Well known for its well-developed alien races and interesting background fiction, the ""Sotsverse"" has been the setting for three popular PC games over the last ten years.
 The first installment of the original 4X space strategy game Sword of the Stars was developed independently by Kerberos Productions from 2003-2005 and released in 2006 by Lighthouse Interactive. The game and its universe quickly became a cult classic among 4X gamers with a taste for its strategic and tactical depth, original design, interesting alien races and gripping real-time combat. The initial release was followed from 2006-2009 by three full expansions and a full-length military science fiction novel, The Deacon's Tale. 
A stand-alone 4X strategy sequel, Sword of the Stars 2: Lords of Winter was released in 2011 by Paradox Interactive. The first expansion for SotS 2, The End of Flesh, was bundled for free with the game to become ""the Enhanced Edition"" of the game in 2012. With the release of the End of Flesh expansion, the SotSverse had grown to host seven playable Imperial Races, each with its own high technology and well-developed interstellar empire, as well as countless smaller independent races, Elder races, and cosmic mysteries. As of September 2013, the SotSverse has produced ten years' worth of concept art and over 200,000 words of background fiction and Lore!
In October of 2012 the developers of Sword of the Stars broke free from the traditional ""publisher/dev"" model of game development and went fully independent for the first time. Kerberos Productions used Indiegogo to crowd-fund their first self-published game. Sword of the Stars: The Pit was a departure from the previous 4X titles of the franchise, a deceptively cute and brutally lethal science fiction roguelike. Set in the underground laboratory of a genocidal bio-weapons genius, The Pit was a single-player rpg which allowed players to experience the chills, thrills, monsters and mayhem of the Sotsverse as never before.
Development of The Pit was completed on schedule and successfully delivered to supporters of the crowd-funding campaign in February 2013. It has since become an indie hit, and the fastest-selling game in the history of the studio. Mind Games,  the first expansion for The Pit, was released in July of 2013 with typical reviews of 8/10 and 9/10.
Sword of the Stars: Ground Pounders will be the second fully independent title developed by Kerberos and crowd-funded via the Indiegogo platform. In Ground Pounders, we're hoping to push the envelope once again and expand the Sotsverse in a new direction, bringing its vibrant high-tech backdrop to the genre of hex-based, turn-based 2D wargaming.


The production team of Sword of the Stars: Ground Pounders consists of ten professional game developers, who between them have over 80 years of cumulative experience in the gaming industry and have contributed to over a dozen shipped titles.
(1) Martin E. Cirulis is the Lead Designer of Ground Pounders and the CEO of Kerberos Productions. His career in the computer gaming industry spans nearly twenty years, beginning as a professional reviewer for Computer Gaming World magazine in 1994. He worked as Narrative Designer on Homeworld and Ground Control and has since served as Lead Designer on several shipped titles, including Homeworld: Cataclysm, Treasure Planet: Battle at Procyon, the original Sword of the Stars and all of its expansions, Fort Zombie, Sword of the Stars 2: Lords of Winter, and Sword of the Stars: the Pit. He is also an old school wargamer, and he has brought his love of the form to this game.(2) Arinn Dembo has been the Lead Writer of Kerberos Productions since the founding of the studio in 2004. She has worked in the gaming industry since 1994, and contributed background fiction to Homeworld, Homeworld: Cataclysm, Ground Control, and Arcanum: of Steamworks and Magick Obscura before she began working full time at Kerberos. She is the creator of the Sword of the Stars universe and the Fort Zombie universe, and has worked as a designer on Sword of the Stars and its expansions, Fort Zombie, Sword of the Stars 2: Lords of Winter, and Sword of the Stars: The Pit. Her ideas and characters appear throughout Ground Pounders, which covers the planetside battles of the Hiver War, 2408-2436.(3) Ken Lee has been working in the gaming industry since 1999 and has been a 2D artist for Kerberos Productions since the founding of the studio in 2004. In addition to his work on Ground Pounders, he has contributed the majority of 2D art assets for all Kerberos titles since the founding of the studio, including the original Sword of the Stars and all expansions, Fort Zombie, Sword of the Stars 2: Lords of Winter, and Sword of the Stars: The Pit. (4) Ryan Blanks is a visual artist with extensive experience in both 3D modeling and animation. He began his career by completing the advanced animation course with honors at the University of Victoria, receiving the Excellence in Animation award upon graduation. After a brief stint providing special effects and animation in the film and television industries, he joined Kerberos Productions in 2007, during the development of the Born of Blood expansion for the original Sword of the Stars. He has contributed 3D art and animation to seven Kerberos releases since then, including all three expansions of the original Sword of the Stars, Fort Zombie, both Sword of the Stars 2: Lords of Winter, SotS 2: End of Flesh, and Ground Pounders. (5) Shane Lazarus is the Intern, Kerberos Messageboard Cleric, tester, maker of breads, associate designer and wargamer of the team. Ground Pounders will be his first game.(6) James Goldthorpe is a Level 28 Network Wizard! James began his quest at the tender level of 10, where he began casting spells in the mystical language of Basic to make his first text-based RPGs. From then on he launched a merciless grind with little sleep until obtaining the C++ feat, and mastering the dark arcane magics of network engineering. After attending the Guild of Game Development at the Art Institute of Vancouver, he received a party invitation in 2012 from Kerberos Productions. He has since sacrificed many beasts and prayed to foul gods to help give birth to the Sword of the Stars II: End of Flesh expansion. In his spare time, James enjoys lifting heavy iron things and placing them back down, when not casting code.(7) Darren “Ddub” Waine graduated from SAIT Polytechnic with a degree in Automated Systems Engineering Technologies (which is building, maintaining, and programming robots, for those who don’t know!). He later pursued studies in video game development through The Art Institute of Vancouver. After graduation, he worked at Electronic Arts on the games EA Sports Active 2 and Fight Night Champion before moving on to join Kerberos Productions. He worked on Sword of the Stars 2: Lords of Winter and became the Technical Lead of the project during its expansion, Sword of the Stars 2: End of Flesh. He is a highly dedicated member of the team, well loved by Kerberos fans, and tends to work on Centaurian time.(8) Nick “Nextek” Naso began his career in gaming at the Art Institutes of Vancouver and then went on to create, maintain and lead development of a large game-mod and the resulting community, for a title which shall remain nameless. This included the vast amount of database and security knowledge needed to maintain data for thousands of users–experience which he brought with him to Kerberos when he joined the company as a programmer in 2012, with duties ranging from gameplay programming, tools creation and maintenance, UI programming, to data management and customer support. Ground Pounders is his second Kerberos game, after Sword of the Stars: End of Flesh. (9) Chris “Degrassi” Gerspacher is the Art Director of Ground Pounders and one of the founding partners of Kerberos Productions. He has worked in the gaming industry since 2001, and since the founding of the studio he has served as the Art Director and contributed 2D and 3D art assets for all Kerberos titles, in particular the original Sword of the Stars, Sword of the Stars 2, and The Pit.(10) Christopher Stewart is the Executive Producer of Ground Pounders and the COO of Kerberos Productions. He has been working actively in the computer gaming industry since 1997 and served as a Designer on Homeworld: Cataclysm, Treasure Planet: Battle at Procyon and Bully before becoming a founding partner of Kerberos Productions. He has been the Producer of all Kerberos games since the founding of the studio in 2004.

""I’m not exactly a strategy buff, but the pure sensation of moving troops around, outflanking and out-thinking even an AI is addictive. The demo was far more massive than I was expecting and an hour slipped away before I’d really noticed.--the flavour of the sci-fi universe and my unfamiliarity with the genre kept me interested. In their own way, successful defenses and annihilating strikes were exhilarating, but in a brandy and cigars way rather than a bombastic one. With a bit of patience for rather wordy tutorial, I’d recommend anyone check it out."" --Rock, Paper, Shotgun""Each unit can only attack once per turn, so it’s probably not a bad idea to think about every move thoroughly. When you attack an enemy, the “odds table” pops up which calculates your chance on a victory. Something I found quite cool is that you see your troops actually fighting in two separate windows that open after the odds table. It brings a vivid touch to the fighting....It looks like a game where you’ll have to sink your teeth in to really understand it, but it might just be worth the energy. I recommend to the fans of the turn-based war-game genre to give this demo a try and see for yourself if this is the game you’ve been waiting for."" - 3rd Strike""TBS games kick major ass, especially with touch devices. Ground Pounders might not look as pretty as some other games, but its cross platform and asynchronous multiplayer make it more than worthy of being on this list."" -- Gameswoof, Top 10 Kickstarters for Android""I love the SotS universe, with its colorful cast of species (psychic whales, dauntless space ants, to name a couple) and hard sci-fi bent, and the idea of playing Panzer Corps in it tickles me. And it sure would be nice to play it on my iPad instead of having to dust off my Android tablet."" --Pocket Tactics 
""From what I’ve played of the PC demo that released a while back, Ground Pounders seems like a pretty neat little turn-based strategy game."" --Hardcore Gamer


Ground Pounders is currently in Alpha and under active development. What we hope to accomplish with your help is to take the game from its current Alpha state to Beta by November 2013, and to have a complete, polished version of the game ready for release by Christmas of this year.Yes, this is a fast turn-around time! But if we are able to meet our project budget we are aiming for the following features by the end of December:
Control one of 2 Armies - Human or Hivers
50+ units covering Land, Sea, and Air forces
Battle across alien worlds on exotic battlefields, including airless moons, lava plains, and meteor blasted wastelands
Seize orbital superiority and call down Orbital Bombardment on your foes
Build Airfields, Fortified Areas, and repair/destroy Bridges
Improve your Unit's experience and abilities over 2 Playable Campaigns
Unlock and collect Combat Cards for each playable Race
Build unique Combat Card Decks and tune them for specific Battles
Choose from over 30 Scenarios, playable in Skirmish Mode or Head-to-Head Multi-player Mode
Cross-Platform Support for PC and Android-compatible devices
Create and Trade your own Battles using Scenario and Unit Editors
Enjoy a SotSdex filled with Lore details on famous Units, Personalities, Battles and Weapon Systems


PLEASE NOTE: the original crowd-funding budget for the Ground Pounders was $42,000, for a development plan that had much more content on release, including an additional playable faction (The Tarkas) and another full campaign, more scenarios possible in all three campaigns, and more units available to all three factions.If this campaign meets or exceeds the original budget, we will still be very happy to provide all of that content for free to all supporters, as the first ""Stretch Goal"" of the campaign! Crushing planets is always fun...but we all know that being able to crush your FRIEND's planet is even better.Ground Pounders
 has been designed from the start to be an asynchronous multi-player 
game. This means that play is turn-based, but that you can do your turn 
any time, and your opponent can get back to it any time.
No staring at the screen waiting for your opponent to move in Ground Pounders!
 Just do your turn, and then maybe play some single-player until your 
friend does his turn. The game will let you know when your opponent has 
finished his turn, and it's time for you to play again.
Even better though, Ground Pounders will be multi-player capable across MULTIPLE PLATFORMS! 
 Are you stuck at work with no gaming device but your pad, while your 
friend across the country is already home on his PC?  No problem! Ground Pounders
 will let you play together, regardless of the fact that you're on 
separate platforms.  And you will be able to switch platforms on the go,
 so that when your friend needs to go out for dinner later in the 
evening, he can just switch to his phone-based version of Ground Pounders and continue the game!
Our current plan to to release the game in December for PC and Android-based phones and pads. Would you like to see Ground Pounders
 supported on more platforms? Check out our Stretch Goals! With extra support from you, we'll be able to get the game out for 
Mac, iOS and Linux right away, and everyone who supports the campaign at the Early Bird level or higher will get access to all available platforms for free!
If the campaign does not reach its higher Stretch Goals, the process of converting the game to other platforms will be much slower, and we will only be able to offer our supporters the two platforms we have planned for initial release: PC and Android.

What do you get for supporting the development of Ground Pounders? Well, a lot of things. Primarily, you get to bring a cool new game into the world and revive a genre which could use some new blood, new ideas, and access to all of the exciting new platforms for turn-based wargames in the modern era.
Beyond that, by supporting Kerberos and other truly independent studios, you will be helping to create a better world for all gamers and all developers! Crowd-funding is a healthier, more transparent and more democratic system of game development than all previous models, and although it may not work for every genre and style of game, we believe that it will work extremely well for games that do not need a huge budget to produce a fun, playable product. 
In addition to the most important Perks, though, we've tried to come up with a variety of reward levels which will offer a good value for supporters on any budget. We've scaled back the budget of the game and the physical items we offer to make the project more economical, but if the campaign does well and people really want them, we can add any Perks that you miss! Please leave us a comment with your suggestions.

Do we have Stretch Goals? Yes we do! Our primary goal for this campaign is very simple, just enough funding to keep the lights on and keep the team working while we take the game to its Beta phase and final phase over the next few months. But if we manage to raise more than the basics, we've put together a few Stretch Goals that we believe will increase the value of the game for all Backers of the project.35K - BRING BACK THE TARKAS!
Our first Stretch Goal will be to expand the game to include the Tarka, a third playable faction! This expansion would include a full-length playable campaign from the Tarka perspective, a set of Units and unique Effect cards, and a larger number of scenarios in all three playable campaigns.
45K - MAC VERSION!Our second Stretch Goal is to release the Mac and PC versions of Ground Pounders simultaneously. If we reach this goal, all Backers at the Early Bird Level and above will receive both the PC and Mac versions of the game for free.60K - iOS VERSION!Our third Stretch Goal will be to make Ground Pounders available on all Apple-compatible pads and phones. Again, if we reach this goal, all Backers at the Early Bird Level and above will receive the PC, Mac and iOS versions of the game.68K - LINUX SUPPORT!Never to be forgotten are the Linux users! If we make our fourth Stretch Goal, we will make a Linux version of the game available to players who prefer that platform. All Backers at the Early Bird Level and Above will have access to the Linux version.75K - CARD BOOSTER PACK!Our fifth Stretch Goal is a Booster Pack DLC which will add 15 new Combat Cards to the base game. If we reach this Stretch Goal, all Backers at the Early Bird Level and above will receive the Booster Pack DLC for free.80K - HIGH DEF MAP PACK FOR MOBILE USERS!If our campaign reaches the lofty goal of 80K, we'll release a second DLC, a High-Definition Map Pack. All Backers at the Early Bird Level and above will receive the Map Pack for free.
Well, we did give the other popular crowd-funding platform a fair shake this time! But Indiegogo was our first choice on on our first successful crowd-funding campaign for Sword of the Stars: The Pit, and Indiegogo will allow us to move forward with a version of Ground Pounders that is scaled to the level of support from our player base. We will continue to use Indiegogo in the future whenever possible, both for its flexibility and because it remains the best platform for many of our European supporters, and for many backers who prefer it over Amazon payments.
A lot of our Supporters have asked this question! We have been delighted and humbled by the player response to our crowd-funding campaign for this game so far. We realize that that not everyone is able to make large cash contributions and pick up a lot of fancy items, but every dollar counts--and so does every Share and mention of our campaign!Please continue to spread the word about Ground Pounders, and let potential supporters know that we have moved the campaign to Indiegogo! This extra phase of the campaign will be very short, with just a few weeks for those who really wanted to jump in to support the game and the team, and pick up some cool collectible Perks before they are no longer available. The campaign will end at the end of October, so grab your game and gear while you can!BORN TO BRAWL! GO GROUND POUNDERS GO!",30.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<p><b>Järn</b> är ett nytt fantasyrollspel bland klanernas folk i en mytisk forntid där världen är vild, otämjd och farlig. Ulvar och alver jagar i skogarna. Troll och jättar hemsöker bergen. Runor håller hemligheter och andar ger järtecken. Klanen är din trygghet, men hyser även fiender som kan utmana eller förråda dig.</p>
<p>I Järn bygger man sin egen spelvärld. Grundboken på 112 snabblästa sidor hjälper och vägleder spelare och spelledare att tillsammans skapa världen, rollpersonerna och deras klan, innan de formar sina egna öden i klanernas land. </p>
<p>Järns snabba och taktiska regler är en modern version av de dominerande svenska rollspelen från åttiotalet, vilket gör det enkelt för både nybörjare och veteraner att börja spela. </p>
<p>Här finns intensiva konflikter, farliga utmaningar och snabba strider, andebesvärjande trolldom och ett spelardrivet klanskapande som sätter rollpersonerna och deras dramatiska öden i fokus.</p>

vilket hela spelet vilar på:

</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b><span>Drama inom och utom
     klanen</span></b>: Rollpersonerna tillhör en klan, som spelarna
     skapar när de gör sina rollpersoner. Klanen kan ses som ""den förste
     rollpersonen"". Klanen är rollpersonernas utökade släkt som inte bara
     omfattar blodsband, utan även trälar, frillor och ingifta. Rollpersonerna
     är viktiga personer i klanen med inflytande, men de är inte de enda och de
     drar inte nödvändigtvis jämt.</li>
<li>
<b>Äventyr i den storslagna
     vildmarken</b>: I klanernas land finns
     inga städer, utan bara otämjd och storslagen vildmark. Vildmarken innebär
     en utmaning som man måste förbereda sig inför och ha kunskap att hantera.</li>
<li>
<b>Andevärlden såväl som den
     fysiska världen</b>: Andevärlden är nära och
     påtaglig, till och med för vanligt folk. Sejdkonan har inte exklusiv
     tillgång till andevärlden, och inte heller har prästen exklusiv tillgång
     till gudarna. Även vanligt folk kommer att korsa andarnas vägar genom sin
     själsform. Och
     ibland vandrar gudarna i världen.</li>
<li>
<b>Gränsländerna mot
     civilisationen</b>: Klanen och vildmarken
     är rollpersonernas hem, men det finns en civiliserad högkultur och den är
     inte långt borta. <i>Kungariket</i> är vildmarkens antites: ur
     klanernas synvinkel är det dekadent, intolerant och korrumperat, och det
     sprider sig sakta över världen. Men <i>Kungariket</i> är också
     kultiverat och sofistikerat. <i>Kungariket</i> kommer att
     innebära en stor förändring för klanen när de möts, och inte nödvändigtvis
     till det bättre.</li>
<li>
<b>Rollpersonernas öde</b>: Alla rollpersoner är speciella i berättelsen.
     Varje rollperson bär på ett öde, en episk saga som vill bli berättad.
     Rollpersonerna kan vara gudars avkomma, hemligheters bevarare,
     legendariska ledare eller utvalda för ett stordåd. Ödet kommer att
     genomsyra kampanjen och kanske ställa rollpersonerna mot varandra på vägen
     mot den episka sagans slut.</li>
</ul>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1411299/files/20150424023217-j_rn_och_dess_ursprung.png?1429867937"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Järn bygger på <b>BRP</b>, eller <i>Basic Roleplaying</i>. BRP är ett anrikt regelsystem som måste anses vara det traditionella svenska regelsystemet. </p>
<p>BRP är rätt intuitivt och nybörjarvänligt eftersom man slår procent­tärning eller tjugosidig tärning under ett färdighetsvärde, och det är enkelt att modifiera. Det har också nackdelar i sin ursprungliga form, bland annat:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>ett antal
     grundvärden som knappt används</li>
<li>härledda
     värden som följer helt egna specialregler</li>
<li>en tendens
     att expanderas så att det blir ohanterligt och krångligt</li>
<li>en
     motståndstabell</li>
<li>rätt
     tråkiga strider</li>
</ul>
<p>Med Järn har vi försökt göra en BRP som behåller fördelarna men saknar nackdelarna.</p>
<div><br/></div>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1411300/files/20150424023238-vem__r_du.png?1429867958"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div>
<div>
<p>Järn skrevs med huvudsakligen två sorters
användare i åtanke. </p>
<p><b>Du som gillar din spelvärld
men inte ditt regelsystem</b>: Det är egentligen inget
fel med världen i det spel du spelar, men regelsystemet passar inte värld eller
spelstil eller kommer till och med i vägen. Du vill ha ett traditionellt
regelsystem, men som ändå är modernt och innovativt, som hjälper dig att spela
ditt favoritspel utan att hindras eller behöva lära dig ett nytt sätt att
spela. Eller så är regelsystemet okej, men saknar stöd för någon av Järns grundpelare och känner att de skulle tillföra något
till spelvärlden.</p>
<p><span>Järn</span> ger dig ett system som har kokats ner till färdighetsslag som används
enligt ett fåtal metoder. Dessa metoder kan sedan appliceras på vilken
situation som helst. Du lär dig inte en specialregel för en viss situation,
utan du lär dig att en generell metod kan användas i alla situationer.</p>
<p><b>Du som vill spela fantasy, men har
inte tid att gräva ner dig i detaljerna</b>: Det här är
nästan motsatsen till ovanstående. Världen har ett så stort kunskapskrav för
dig att den kommer i vägen för dig. Du har inte tid att plugga påhittade
världars geografi, utan vill egentligen bara komma igång med häftiga äventyr.
Alternativt kan det vara så att den påhittade världen kommer i vägen för dina
egna visioner.</p>
<p><span>Järn</span> arbetar med inspiration och verktyg snarare än spelvärld. <span>Järn berättar brottstycken av sagor från en vild och
storslagen värld och inbjuder dig att avsluta sagorna eller skapa dina egna. Järn ger dig metoder för dig och dina medspelare att
samla visionerna på ett papper, och hjälper dig sedan att hitta rätt i
visionerna för att skapa värld och sagor. Basen är klanen, som skapas
gemen­samt samtidigt som ni skapar rollpersonerna, och den utvecklas samtidigt
som man använder den för att skapa äventyr.</span></p>

<b>Järn</b> har en lång tradition bakom sig.<p></p>
<p>Det första svenska rollspelet som publicerades i Sverige byggde liksom Järn också på <b>Basic Roleplaying</b>. Men det var inte bara det. Det var också ett öppet rollspel som bjöd in till upptäckande och skapande. Det fanns ingen färdig spelvärld, utan den växte fram under spel. Vi skapade den gemensamt med utgångspunkt från allt som vi snodde från våra favoritfantasyförfattare och fragment som publicerades i äventyr och moduler.</p>
<p>Då var det nödvändigt. Hobbyn var ny och ingen, knappt ens proffsen, visste hur man skulle göra, och böckerna som talade om hur man gjorde var inte skrivna än. </p>
<p>Så vi bara gjorde det! Det fanns en idé och det räckte. Det behövdes inga tjocka tilläggsböcker för att spela alver. Riken behövde inga detaljerade kartor, för vi ritade dem själva. Det behövdes inga listor med mäktiga spelledarpersoner, för de hade vi redan hittat på, och var ofta gamla rollpersoner som vi hade tröttnat på.</p>
<p>Detta är traditionen bakom Järn: att göra själv och skapa ihop, snarare än att läsa in och förstå någon annans skapelse. <b>Järn</b> är mitt sätt att hålla traditionen levande. </p>– <i>Krister Sundelin, april 2015</i><p></p>

<div>Järn är färdigskrivet. En exklusiv <i>Gryningsutgåva</i> gavs ut i en mycket begränsad upplaga på GothCon 2015. Nu vill vi nå ut till en bredare publik, och för det behöver vi pengar för att kunna trycka upp en större och lyxigare upplaga med hårda pärmar. Pengar kommer även att användas till att skapa illustrationer, skapa expanderat material och bygga grunden för ett långt produktliv. <br/>

</div></div>","Järn är ett nytt fantasyrollspel bland klanernas folk i en mytisk forntid där världen är vild, otämjd och farlig. Ulvar och alver jagar i skogarna. Troll och jättar hemsöker bergen. Runor håller hemligheter och andar ger järtecken. Klanen är din trygghet, men hyser även fiender som kan utmana eller förråda dig.
I Järn bygger man sin egen spelvärld. Grundboken på 112 snabblästa sidor hjälper och vägleder spelare och spelledare att tillsammans skapa världen, rollpersonerna och deras klan, innan de formar sina egna öden i klanernas land. 
Järns snabba och taktiska regler är en modern version av de dominerande svenska rollspelen från åttiotalet, vilket gör det enkelt för både nybörjare och veteraner att börja spela. 
Här finns intensiva konflikter, farliga utmaningar och snabba strider, andebesvärjande trolldom och ett spelardrivet klanskapande som sätter rollpersonerna och deras dramatiska öden i fokus.
Tips: För att se illustrationer och material, se under ""Gallery"", ovan!




 ""Ett glänsande spel. Äventyr där korpen flyger och vargen ylar.""– Anders Blixt, mångårig rollspelsskapare
""Med sin inneboende skaparglädje och spännande system för världsbyggande är Järn en perfekt introduktion till rollspelshobbyn.""– Fredrik Malmberg, grundare av Äventyrsspel

Järn har fem grundpelare
vilket hela spelet vilar på:




Drama inom och utom
     klanen: Rollpersonerna tillhör en klan, som spelarna
     skapar när de gör sina rollpersoner. Klanen kan ses som ""den förste
     rollpersonen"". Klanen är rollpersonernas utökade släkt som inte bara
     omfattar blodsband, utan även trälar, frillor och ingifta. Rollpersonerna
     är viktiga personer i klanen med inflytande, men de är inte de enda och de
     drar inte nödvändigtvis jämt.

Äventyr i den storslagna
     vildmarken: I klanernas land finns
     inga städer, utan bara otämjd och storslagen vildmark. Vildmarken innebär
     en utmaning som man måste förbereda sig inför och ha kunskap att hantera.

Andevärlden såväl som den
     fysiska världen: Andevärlden är nära och
     påtaglig, till och med för vanligt folk. Sejdkonan har inte exklusiv
     tillgång till andevärlden, och inte heller har prästen exklusiv tillgång
     till gudarna. Även vanligt folk kommer att korsa andarnas vägar genom sin
     själsform. Och
     ibland vandrar gudarna i världen.

Gränsländerna mot
     civilisationen: Klanen och vildmarken
     är rollpersonernas hem, men det finns en civiliserad högkultur och den är
     inte långt borta. Kungariket är vildmarkens antites: ur
     klanernas synvinkel är det dekadent, intolerant och korrumperat, och det
     sprider sig sakta över världen. Men Kungariket är också
     kultiverat och sofistikerat. Kungariket kommer att
     innebära en stor förändring för klanen när de möts, och inte nödvändigtvis
     till det bättre.

Rollpersonernas öde: Alla rollpersoner är speciella i berättelsen.
     Varje rollperson bär på ett öde, en episk saga som vill bli berättad.
     Rollpersonerna kan vara gudars avkomma, hemligheters bevarare,
     legendariska ledare eller utvalda för ett stordåd. Ödet kommer att
     genomsyra kampanjen och kanske ställa rollpersonerna mot varandra på vägen
     mot den episka sagans slut.




Järn bygger på BRP, eller Basic Roleplaying. BRP är ett anrikt regelsystem som måste anses vara det traditionella svenska regelsystemet. 
BRP är rätt intuitivt och nybörjarvänligt eftersom man slår procent­tärning eller tjugosidig tärning under ett färdighetsvärde, och det är enkelt att modifiera. Det har också nackdelar i sin ursprungliga form, bland annat:


ett antal
     grundvärden som knappt används
härledda
     värden som följer helt egna specialregler
en tendens
     att expanderas så att det blir ohanterligt och krångligt
en
     motståndstabell
rätt
     tråkiga strider

Med Järn har vi försökt göra en BRP som behåller fördelarna men saknar nackdelarna.



Järn skrevs med huvudsakligen två sorters
användare i åtanke. 
Du som gillar din spelvärld
men inte ditt regelsystem: Det är egentligen inget
fel med världen i det spel du spelar, men regelsystemet passar inte värld eller
spelstil eller kommer till och med i vägen. Du vill ha ett traditionellt
regelsystem, men som ändå är modernt och innovativt, som hjälper dig att spela
ditt favoritspel utan att hindras eller behöva lära dig ett nytt sätt att
spela. Eller så är regelsystemet okej, men saknar stöd för någon av Järns grundpelare och känner att de skulle tillföra något
till spelvärlden.
Järn ger dig ett system som har kokats ner till färdighetsslag som används
enligt ett fåtal metoder. Dessa metoder kan sedan appliceras på vilken
situation som helst. Du lär dig inte en specialregel för en viss situation,
utan du lär dig att en generell metod kan användas i alla situationer.
Du som vill spela fantasy, men har
inte tid att gräva ner dig i detaljerna: Det här är
nästan motsatsen till ovanstående. Världen har ett så stort kunskapskrav för
dig att den kommer i vägen för dig. Du har inte tid att plugga påhittade
världars geografi, utan vill egentligen bara komma igång med häftiga äventyr.
Alternativt kan det vara så att den påhittade världen kommer i vägen för dina
egna visioner.
Järn arbetar med inspiration och verktyg snarare än spelvärld. Järn berättar brottstycken av sagor från en vild och
storslagen värld och inbjuder dig att avsluta sagorna eller skapa dina egna. Järn ger dig metoder för dig och dina medspelare att
samla visionerna på ett papper, och hjälper dig sedan att hitta rätt i
visionerna för att skapa värld och sagor. Basen är klanen, som skapas
gemen­samt samtidigt som ni skapar rollpersonerna, och den utvecklas samtidigt
som man använder den för att skapa äventyr.




Järn har en lång tradition bakom sig.
Det första svenska rollspelet som publicerades i Sverige byggde liksom Järn också på Basic Roleplaying. Men det var inte bara det. Det var också ett öppet rollspel som bjöd in till upptäckande och skapande. Det fanns ingen färdig spelvärld, utan den växte fram under spel. Vi skapade den gemensamt med utgångspunkt från allt som vi snodde från våra favoritfantasyförfattare och fragment som publicerades i äventyr och moduler.
Då var det nödvändigt. Hobbyn var ny och ingen, knappt ens proffsen, visste hur man skulle göra, och böckerna som talade om hur man gjorde var inte skrivna än. 
Så vi bara gjorde det! Det fanns en idé och det räckte. Det behövdes inga tjocka tilläggsböcker för att spela alver. Riken behövde inga detaljerade kartor, för vi ritade dem själva. Det behövdes inga listor med mäktiga spelledarpersoner, för de hade vi redan hittat på, och var ofta gamla rollpersoner som vi hade tröttnat på.
Detta är traditionen bakom Järn: att göra själv och skapa ihop, snarare än att läsa in och förstå någon annans skapelse. Järn är mitt sätt att hålla traditionen levande. – Krister Sundelin, april 2015



Järn är färdigskrivet. En exklusiv Gryningsutgåva gavs ut i en mycket begränsad upplaga på GothCon 2015. Nu vill vi nå ut till en bredare publik, och för det behöver vi pengar för att kunna trycka upp en större och lyxigare upplaga med hårda pärmar. Pengar kommer även att användas till att skapa illustrationer, skapa expanderat material och bygga grunden för ett långt produktliv. 




Krister Sundelin är en gammal Neogames-veteran som bland annat har skrivit Consaber, Alver, Dvärgar och bidragit till många andra böcker. Han har också givit ut rollspelen Trollvinter, Västmark och Skymningshem: Andra Imperiet på eget förlag. 
Helmgast AB gav under 2014 ut rollspelsklassikern Eon IV, i den mest framgångsrika crowdfunding-kampanjen för ett svenskt rollspel någonsin. Järn ges ut i ett samarbete mellan Krister och Helmgast, där Helmgast står som garant för att spelet kommer att ges ut.

Frakt ingår om man också har beställt antingen kampanjbok eller någon version av grundboken. Har man inte beställt kampanjbok eller grundbok så tillkommer €10 för frakt inom Sverige, €20 för frakt inom Europa och €30 för frakt till USA.









Fraktkostnader inom Sverige ingår för grundboken och kampanjboken! 


Lägg till €10 för frakt inom Europa. 


Lägg till €20 för frakt till USA.









När vissa totala köpenivåer har uppnåtts låses extramål upp. Ett extramål är något som alla som har varit med i kampanjen får ta del av. Om inget annat specifikt anges så är extramålen digitala, vanligen i PDF. 
Några delmål är add-ons. En add-on är ett extramål som man lägger till sin order. De läggs upp som en ny perk när de låses upp. Add-ons ingår inte automatiskt i ens ursprungliga order, utan man måste beställa dem separat. 




UPPNÅTT! €1000:
Snabbstartsregler!
Når vi finansieringsmålet kommer Snabbstartsregler till Järn.
Snabbstartsreglerna kommer att innehålla fem förskapade rollpersoner och deras
förskapade klan. Snabbstartsreglerna med rollpersoner och klan kommer också att

stora vita vargen Vargafader, en kraftfull varelse som vördas av isfolket.


UPPNÅTT! €2500: Startmiljö 1:
Bergs- och fjordfolket!
En startmiljö är ett område med konkreta resurser för att sparka igång
inspirationen till klanskapandet. Varje startmiljö har en karta över området,
en karta över klanens hemvist, beskrivningar av intressanta saker i närheten,
och ett eller två enbladsscenarier. Först ut är startmiljön för bergs- och
fjordfolket!


UPPNÅTT! €3000: Referenskort!
Vi stoppar in referenskort i boken som sammanfattar de viktigaste

Inte ens kungariket kan hota den rödhåriga hövdingen av Järnklipporna,
för hon har sjöormen Welung som sin slav. Inget skepp kan närma sig
Järnklipporna utan hennes medgivande, för då sänker sjöormen dem och slukar
alla ombord.


UPPNÅTT! €8500: Startmiljö 6:
Mundanas järnålder!
Denna unika startmiljö är inte riktigt som övriga startmiljöer, utan har

liksom kartor över Missladal med omnejd och en kampanjskiss som tar
rollpersonerna från Missladal till Mundana!

UPPNÅTT! €10,700: Skrivkramp!

På 100.000 SEK eller €10700 så parkerar sig Järn stadigt bland de mest framgångsrika rollspelen, enligt spelbloggen.se. Det är värt något extra! Så det firar vi med att Krille signerar alla exemplar på nivån Klanhjälte, Hövding och Kämpe om vi når dit!


€12,500: Box!
Järn med tillbehör paketeras i en stabil box!






Järn gavs ut som en begränsad Gryningsversion på GothCon 2015. Gryningsversionen kommer inte att tryckas om. Istället ger vi ut en ny version med hårda pärmar!


Bonus: Om du äger ett av de sällsynta exemplaren av Järn Gryningsversionen, och satsar pengar på minst nivå Kämpe, så får du en uppsättning tärningar på köpet! Du får även en speciell Grynings-titel vid ditt namn. Notera att för att verifiera din Gryningsstatus kommer vi efter kampanjen be att du skickar ett foto av dig tillsammans med din Gryningsversion.






Vad skiljer den här versionen från Gryningsversionen som släpptes på Gothcon?
Textmassan är i stort sett samma, fast med mer korrekturläsning, balansering och förtydliganden. Det ser ut att bli åtta extra sidor: rollformulär, stridskort och klanformulär plus en sida att tacka crowdfundare tar upp fyra av dem. Resten används för att göra layouten luftigare och sätta in några extra illustrationer. Boken får också hårda pärmar, Dan ""Dante"" Algstrand har ritat en ny logotyp, och Ronja Melin gör två nya omslagsbilder, en för Kämpe-versionen och en för Hövding- och Klanhjälte-versionen. 


Vad är en ""personlig sejd"" för något?


Det är ett ark med en sejdsång som vi skickar med – en besvärjelse, helt enkelt. Varje sejdsång är unik och ingen annan får den sejdsången. Det innebär i sin tur att om allt går riktigt bra får vi skriva 55 stycken sejdsånger. Men jag har ett antal böcker med minst 5000 riktiga besvärjelser att inspireras av så det ska nog gå bra.

Måste jag köpa kampanjboken Världsträdets grenar för att få de upplåsta extramålen?
Har du varit med i crowdfundern så får du extramålen som PDFer. Däremot kommer inte det kampanjboksunika materialet annat än som en del av kampanjboken, och vill man ha extramålen i tryckt form så får man skaffa kampanjboken. 
Om jag vill ha både grundboken och kampanjboken, är det både Kämpe och Världsvandrare jag ska välja för totalt €61?
Precis så. Eller Hövding plus Världsvandrare om det finns någon Hövding kvar. 
Har du redan beställt en grundbok som Kämpe eller Hövding, och vill ha kampanjboken också, så behöver du lägga till en Världsvandrare som en ny pledge.
Vad är en""add-on""?
En add-on är något som man lägger till sin order. När de låses upp så lägger vi upp en ny perk med den. En add-on ingår inte automatiskt i ens ursprungliga order, utan man måste beställa dem separat. 
Ingår frakt i en ""add-on""?
I Kampanjboken ingår frakt. För övriga add-ons gäller att man slipper frakt om man också beställer en av grundböckerna eller kampanjboken. Skaffar man övriga add-ons utan att beställa grundbok eller kampanjbok så kostar frakten extra.






Även om du inte kan eller vill satsa pengar på Järn så kan du ändå hjälpa till att förverkliga rollspelet.

of Canada have been asked to host the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress between July 7 and 14, 2014.The B-17 Sentimental Journey, part of the Commemorative Air Force, based in Mesa, Arizona, wants to include the Gatineau Executive Airport in Gatineau as one of its Canadian stops during summer 2014.  If we can raise enough money, the B-17 will be opened to the general
public on static display and for 30-minute flights over the National Capital Region.  Imagine the feeling! The Ottawa connectionThe Ottawa area has a rich connection to the Boeing B-17
aircraft. Between 1943 and 1946, 168 Heavy Transport Squadron, Royal Canadian
Air Force (RCAF), flew the aircraft out of RCAF Station Rockcliffe.  Dubbed the “flying mail trucks”, these
aircraft flew morale-boosting mail to Canadian soldiers, sailors and airmen
serving overseas.  When the unit disbanded in 1946, it had completed 636 Atlantic
crossings. Including operations from Great Britain, more than 1,000 metric tons
of mail, 4,000 metric tons of freight and 42,057 passengers were transported. 
Although the Rockcliffe airport is currently
still in service and would have made an outstanding venue for the return of the
Flying Fortress, its runway is no longer long enough to accommodate the landing
of the Flying Fortress. As a result, the Gatineau Executive Airport was approached as the best, closest
alternative to celebrate this rich history and connection to Ottawa.Why we need $20KThe B-17 is a very thirsty aircraft. Your sponsorship dollars will help pay for:FuelHotel & transportation for the crewAdvertisingSignagePromotional videoAirfare, hotel and meals for the daughters of fallen B-17 pilot F/L Horace Hillcoat who was posted at Rockcliffe  at the time of his death.  We have invited them to return to the Gatineau-Ottawa area for this event and to remember their father.Contingencies What's in it for you?

<p>You are a highly knowledgeable public and we would like to thank you for your support. But we also wish to make this game available to those who don't have your eminent qualities: the general public!<br/>That would also give you the chance to play with more people and propagate the gaming virus. Or the comics virus. Or both!</p>
<p>With that intent, it is necessary to operate inside a true game production framework: thousands of boxes, and if possible in <strong><em>English, French and German.</em></strong><br/><strong>And we will not lower our expectations in terms of quality!</strong><br/>There's a price tag, though: around 20000€ for a Made In Germany production...</p>
<p>Moreover, in order to offer you even more, we asked a professional sculptor to create specific tokens for our first two factions.<br/>That will allow us to offer you a 100-units limited edition including 10 metal tokens!<br/>We are also looking into replacing the cardboard tokens with plastic or wooden ones.</p>
<p>For fans of the comic, we will have original illustrations made for the covers of the game.<br/>You will be offered to acquire the original drawings as soon as we know there cost (depending of the artisit work !).</p>

<p><strong><strong><img alt=""expl"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.kinigame.com/REQUIEM/igg/science.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/> </strong>The goal of the game?</strong><br/>Lead your faction, tap territories that separate you from your opponent to improve your armies and reach one of its capitals, or destroy all his armies in the same turn!<br/>The contents of each box of Requiem Vampire Knight allow 2 players to play: 2 factions, their cards and tokens. With 2 boxes (identical or not) 4 people can play.<br/>A match takes 20 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Simple, yes, but not simplistic!</strong><br/>If you already know the comic, you will not be surprised to see that the game targets a sufficiently mature public: 14 years old or over.<br/>This doesn't reflect any particular complexity. In fact, after you've tried the introductory rules once, everything is quite simple! Here is the stroke of genius: You don't need to have a lot of equipment or know tons of rules to play !<br/>The board is generated with random cards each time, so you'll have to adapt your strategy...<br/>With its great strategic depth and high re-playability, Requiem vampire knight will offer a new gaming experience with every match.</p>
<p>You can download the rules by following this <a href=""http://www.kinigame.com/REQUIEM/igg/rules_web.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_parent"" title=""Rules Requiem game"">link </a>!<br/>You'll find below some examples of cards and illustrations.</p>

Working like opposite plates of a weight scale, when we reach equilibrium we know we have something good in our hands!<br/>Both avid gamers, you could say we have been steeped in gaming culture since childhood!</p>

 THE GAME

Do you know the comic book Requiem vampire knight?If you don't, I suggest you go directly to your favourite book store and look for it!
Otherwise, welcome to Resurrection!On this evil twin of Earth, the worst criminals are reborn as bloodthirsty monsters.According to the rules of karma, they will be Vampires, Ghouls, Zombies, Werewolves, Distopians, Lemurians ... Here they grow younger from the age they were at death, back to childhood, foetal stage and then disappearance.Here war is eternal, waged for a little more power, wealth, pleasure, revenge...

For over 10 years, Olivier Ledroit (a French illustrator) has been developing the infernal, gothic universe created by Patt Mills (an English author).
Thousands of magnificent illustrations give life to those characters!Based on this universe, we (KiniGame) created a game of battle, development and conquest on a randomly set-up board.

 
 
 
The 1st Set (Early 2013) will pit the Resurrectionnist Vampires vs Pirate Ghouls !
 
 
 

 
 
 
The 2nd Set (a few months later) will centre on the Lemurians vs the Hell Fire Club
 
 
 
Then it will be Distopians vs Archeologists and, of course, champions and expansions for each faction.

 So why a crowdfunding campaign ?
You are a highly knowledgeable public and we would like to thank you for your support. But we also wish to make this game available to those who don't have your eminent qualities: the general public!That would also give you the chance to play with more people and propagate the gaming virus. Or the comics virus. Or both!
With that intent, it is necessary to operate inside a true game production framework: thousands of boxes, and if possible in English, French and German.And we will not lower our expectations in terms of quality!There's a price tag, though: around 20000€ for a Made In Germany production...
Moreover, in order to offer you even more, we asked a professional sculptor to create specific tokens for our first two factions.That will allow us to offer you a 100-units limited edition including 10 metal tokens!We are also looking into replacing the cardboard tokens with plastic or wooden ones.
For fans of the comic, we will have original illustrations made for the covers of the game.You will be offered to acquire the original drawings as soon as we know there cost (depending of the artisit work !).

 The goal of the game?Lead your faction, tap territories that separate you from your opponent to improve your armies and reach one of its capitals, or destroy all his armies in the same turn!The contents of each box of Requiem Vampire Knight allow 2 players to play: 2 factions, their cards and tokens. With 2 boxes (identical or not) 4 people can play.A match takes 20 minutes.
Simple, yes, but not simplistic!If you already know the comic, you will not be surprised to see that the game targets a sufficiently mature public: 14 years old or over.This doesn't reflect any particular complexity. In fact, after you've tried the introductory rules once, everything is quite simple! Here is the stroke of genius: You don't need to have a lot of equipment or know tons of rules to play !The board is generated with random cards each time, so you'll have to adapt your strategy...With its great strategic depth and high re-playability, Requiem vampire knight will offer a new gaming experience with every match.
You can download the rules by following this link !You'll find below some examples of cards and illustrations.

The Designers?Illustrated by Olivier Ledroit, who doesn't need an introduction.Based on an original idea from Youri Faja; developed by Antoine Riot and Youri Faja; built and written by Antoine Riot.We've known each other for years now, and we know what to keep from each other's ideas... Working like opposite plates of a weight scale, when we reach equilibrium we know we have something good in our hands!Both avid gamers, you could say we have been steeped in gaming culture since childhood!
 The Publisher ?KiniGame is a small board game publishing company that has already brought out two party games: Au Tableau and I Will Survive (small printing runs, controlled budget).Requiem vampire knight is its third project. To give it a real chance we cannot skimp on the investment. And so, here we are!

The shipping ?Simple basic shipping is free but if you want a ""following number"" it would be 7$ more ! If you want any special shipping process, anything is possible at your own cost !
* Dedication from the artist...In the COLLECTOR 1 I wrote dedications in the perks but I confused myself : this will be a signature with date and number. We are still negociating dedications !

 
 
 

 
 LE JEU
Connaissez vous la bande dessinée Requiem chevalier vampire ?Si non, je vous conseille de vous diriger vers votre libraire préféré et de vous renseigner !
Si oui, bienvenue sur Résurrection !Ce double négatif de la Terre qui voit se réincarner les pires criminels en monstres sanguinaires. Suivant les règles du karma : ils seront Vampires, Goules, Zombies, Loups Garous, Distopiens, Lémures ...Ici ils rajeunissent depuis l'âge auquel ils sont morts, jusqu'à l'infantilisme, le fœtus et enfin la disparition.Ici la guerre est éternelle pour un peu plus de pouvoir, de richesse, de plaisir, de vengeance...

Depuis plus de 10 ans Olivier Ledroit (illustrateur Français) développe l'univers gothique et infernal créé par Pat Mills (auteur Britannique).Des milliers d'illustrations magnifiques donnent vie à tous ces personnages !Issue de cet univers, nous (KiniGame) avons créé un jeu de batailles, développement et conquête sur un plateau aléatoire.

 
 Le 1er Set (sortie prévue pour début 2013) proposera les Vampires Résurrectionnistes contre les Goules Pirates !
 Le 2ème Set (quelques mois plus tard) concernera les Lémures contre le Hell Fire Club. Puis les Distopiens contre les Archéologistes et bien sur des champions et des extensions pour chaque faction !

  Pourquoi une campagne de financement ?
Vous êtes des personnes averties et nous vous remercions de votre soutien. Mais nous souhaitons aussi pouvoir proposer ce jeu à ceux qui n'ont pas toutes vos qualités : le grand public quoi !Vous aurez ainsi la possibilité de jouer avec plein de gens et de diffuser votre virus du jeu ou de la bande dessinée ou les deux !
Il nous faut donc réaliser une vraie production du jeu, soit plusieurs milliers d'exemplaires et si possible en trois langues : Français, Anglais et Allemand.Et nous ne réduirons pas nos prétentions en terme de qualité de matériel !Tout cela a un coût : comptez 20000€ pour une production en Allemagne...
De plus, pour vous offrir toujours plus de plaisir, nous faisons réaliser par un sculpteur professionnel des pions à l'effigie de nos premières factions. Cela nous permettra de vous proposer une édition limitée à 100 boites comprenant des pions en métal pour les fans !Et nous étudions la possibilité de remplacer les pions en cartons par des pions en plastique.
Pour les Fans de la BD sachez que nous faisons réaliser des illustrations originales par Olivier Ledroit pour les couvertures des jeux. Il vous sera proposé d'acquérir les originaux. Leurs prix dépendront de la taille des œuvres réalisées : nous vous informerons dès que possible ! 

  À propos du jeu :
À la tête de votre faction, exploitez les terrains qui vous séparent de votre adversaire pour améliorer vos armées et atteindre l'une de ses Capitales ou détruire toutes ses armées dans le même tour !Dans chaque boîte de Requiem chevalier vampire, vous trouverez le matériel pour 2 joueurs avec 2 factions, leurs cartes et leurs pions. Avec 2 boîtes (différentes ou non) vous pourrez jouer à 4.Une partie dure 20 minutes.
Simple oui mais pas simpliste !Si vous connaissez la BD vous ne serez pas surpris de voir que le jeu s'adresse à un public averti : 14 ans et plus.Cela ne traduit en rien une complexité du jeu, car après une partie dans les règles d'introduction tout est d'une grande simplicité. C'est là que ce situe le génie de l'affaire : vous n'avez que très peu de matériel ou de règles à connaître pour jouer !Le plateau étant chaque fois généré par un tirage de cartes aléatoire, vous devrez toujours adapter votre stratégie !D'une grande profondeur stratégique et d'une forte re-jouabilité, Requiem chevalier vampire vous apportera des sensations de jeu nouvelles à chaque partie.
Vous pouvez télécharger les règles en suivant ce lien !Nous vous livrons ci-dessous les premières cartes du jeu et certains visuels.

<h3>Hello everyone!</h3> <p>My name is Yuriy, I'm a 26 years old programmer from Russia. I was studying programming &amp; IT in my hometown's university for 7 years. After that I worked as a programmer but my passion  has always been video games so I left my job in order to dedicate myself to the creation of a game.</p>
<h3>The Game</h3>
<div>The game is a real-time space territory seizure strategy. The game will be developed for a wide range of platforms - Windows, Mac OS, Android, iOS. </div>
<div>
<p>The whole Universe is a number of planets floating in the endless space and you must conquer them all in order to win.  Different interstellar races are also trying to do this, but there can only be one winner. Could it be You!</p>In the game several races are presented, each with their own technologies, special skills, strengths and weaknesses, different kinds of ships (some will help you to capture planets, some - to destroy enemy forces), special constructions like turrets or shipyards which will assist you (or your enemy) as the game progresses. Each race has unique abilities ranging from shielding your own planet to nuclear bombardment of those of your enemies. <br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/708278/files/20140710105843-SusX4vhhMTk.jpg?1405015123"" src="""" style=""width: 621.7032967032967px; height: 365px;""/></p>
<p>Usually territory seizure strategies are really fast-paced and to progress through levels you must click fast for about 1-2 minutes, but this game is a different story. My idea is to made true strategy game with tactical fights, resourse collecting, ships and planets upgrades.This does not mean that the game will not be full of swift brute force assaults and sneaky backstabs, but it means that the game will also be filled with more entertaining stuff. Build an immense fleet, construct planetary defences, discover the furthest reaches of the Universe and conquer it in the time and way, that you decide!</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/708334/files/20140710111938-__3.png?1405016378"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>What is so special in the game that I must pay for it?</h3>
</div>
<p>I really love video games so I know what is going on in game industry. There are only a small number of territory seizure strategies and most of good ones are old classics. In addition to that fact the majority of mobile games typically aren't  of the best quality and have only a short gameplay. So I wanted to made a game with beautiful graphics, entertaining long gameplay, interesting storyline and decent music, the game that could be called not even good but EXELLENT. Variable levels of difficulty will give you a challenge when you want it and a relaxing time when you need it, plenty of achievements will force you to think about different winning strategies, combinations of fast-paced fights and strategic developments will not let you became bored. And as a pleasant addition the game will be with you on each of your devices from smart phones to PCs.</p>
<p>And a bit about in-game features:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Upgradable units, structures, abilities</li>
<li>Dreaded boss fights which will make you sweat</li>
<li>Huge maps containing dozens of planets, make you feel like a real star emperor</li>
<li>Unique story and campaign for every race unveiling their motives for war</li>
<li>A lot of animations from sparkling stars to rotating galaxies in the background</li>
</ul>and lots of other exciting stuff! </div> <div> <h3>What We Need</h3> <p>As you know from the beginning of the page I left my job because it will be really difficult to create a game having another full-time job, so I need money for food and utility payments for development time. Also because I want to make the game for wide range of platforms I need access to a range of devices for testing. Finally I am not the only person in the team, so it's also necessary to feed an artist and a composer.</p>
<p>About 2000$ will be spent on different divices and software licences</p>
<p>About 400-600$ will be the Indiegogo tax </p>
<p>About 1500$ will be spent on food for three person for about half a year of game develomment - about 85$/month per person</p>

</div></div>","Hello everyone! My name is Yuriy, I'm a 26 years old programmer from Russia. I was studying programming & IT in my hometown's university for 7 years. After that I worked as a programmer but my passion  has always been video games so I left my job in order to dedicate myself to the creation of a game.
The Game
The game is a real-time space territory seizure strategy. The game will be developed for a wide range of platforms - Windows, Mac OS, Android, iOS. 

The whole Universe is a number of planets floating in the endless space and you must conquer them all in order to win.  Different interstellar races are also trying to do this, but there can only be one winner. Could it be You!In the game several races are presented, each with their own technologies, special skills, strengths and weaknesses, different kinds of ships (some will help you to capture planets, some - to destroy enemy forces), special constructions like turrets or shipyards which will assist you (or your enemy) as the game progresses. Each race has unique abilities ranging from shielding your own planet to nuclear bombardment of those of your enemies. 
Usually territory seizure strategies are really fast-paced and to progress through levels you must click fast for about 1-2 minutes, but this game is a different story. My idea is to made true strategy game with tactical fights, resourse collecting, ships and planets upgrades.This does not mean that the game will not be full of swift brute force assaults and sneaky backstabs, but it means that the game will also be filled with more entertaining stuff. Build an immense fleet, construct planetary defences, discover the furthest reaches of the Universe and conquer it in the time and way, that you decide!


What is so special in the game that I must pay for it?

I really love video games so I know what is going on in game industry. There are only a small number of territory seizure strategies and most of good ones are old classics. In addition to that fact the majority of mobile games typically aren't  of the best quality and have only a short gameplay. So I wanted to made a game with beautiful graphics, entertaining long gameplay, interesting storyline and decent music, the game that could be called not even good but EXELLENT. Variable levels of difficulty will give you a challenge when you want it and a relaxing time when you need it, plenty of achievements will force you to think about different winning strategies, combinations of fast-paced fights and strategic developments will not let you became bored. And as a pleasant addition the game will be with you on each of your devices from smart phones to PCs.
And a bit about in-game features:


Upgradable units, structures, abilities
Dreaded boss fights which will make you sweat
Huge maps containing dozens of planets, make you feel like a real star emperor
Unique story and campaign for every race unveiling their motives for war
A lot of animations from sparkling stars to rotating galaxies in the background
and lots of other exciting stuff!   What We Need As you know from the beginning of the page I left my job because it will be really difficult to create a game having another full-time job, so I need money for food and utility payments for development time. Also because I want to make the game for wide range of platforms I need access to a range of devices for testing. Finally I am not the only person in the team, so it's also necessary to feed an artist and a composer.
About 2000$ will be spent on different divices and software licences
About 400-600$ will be the Indiegogo tax 
About 1500$ will be spent on food for three person for about half a year of game develomment - about 85$/month per person
Even if the project will not collect full sum, the game will still be developed, but at first just under iOS and Windows platforms, then under others in future.
If the project gets more than 4000$  we will add some pleasant upgrades like new game modes, additional animations, instrumental music, and multiplayer options for the game.

<p>Welcome to the next generation of Puzzle crazes. This patented 3D puzzle will challenge the most hardened of puzzle aficionados. You may have seen the 15 Puzzle, which originated in 1878, then approximately 100 years later came the Rubik's Cube. Now only 35 years later we bring you what we like to call the ""Felice Puzzle"", or translated the ""Happy Puzzle"", the more you play, the faster it ""shape shifts"" into another dimension. Let's get the world smiling again; as we hope to put a smile on your face as you discover the many aspects we can apply to this concept. The ""Felice 3D-Puzzle"" is set to become the most popular puzzle of our generation making all of its predecessors look like child's play.</p>
<p>If you think the Cube's 43 Quintillion possibilities, that's 43 billion billion variations, and 36 ways to get home is difficult, the Felice Ball is many times more difficult! It has only one solution, 6 ways to get home and billions of possible combinations. Do you think you have what it takes to meet the challenge of finding just one of the 6 ways to solve the ""Felice 3D-Puzzle""?</p>
<p>Since late last year we've had many balls in the air, hard at work establishing World Wide Patents and PCT's, modelling hand-made variations, each one of these taking in excess of 300 hours to precisely manufacture just one of the ""Felice 3D-Puzzles"". Our team from Simply Puzzling Pty Ltd and PolyPlastics Pty Ltd can now produce this Mind Bending Puzzle in a fraction of the time. We have reduced this process to the extent that we are now ready to bring this Mind-Bending Puzzle to you. After extensive testing and prototyping we are now entering the production phase. This is where you come in to get the ball rolling.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>With your help we will create the biggest craze in puzzles to be released in many years. It will also add an intellectual component to your lives. Never again will you be referred to as a couch potato of your sport, because you can now claim to be an intellectual sports follower. You'll want to take your ""Felice 3D-Puzzle"" everywhere because you won't be able to put it down.</p>
<p>The first edition of this Mind Bending Puzzle by Simply Puzzling and Polyplastics will be in the form of a ""3D Soccer Ball"". Your support is needed to fund the initial production dies, tooling, surface pattern production and robotic assembly line. As a result of your support the 3D Puzzle Balls will be available to generations of puzzle and ball sport followers. The Selective Laser Sintering and PolyJet 3D printing models are now ready to create the robotic assembly line.</p>
<p><strong>Your Impact on Our Project</strong></p>
<p>Your commitment today will provide the funds necessary to expedite our final phase – that is getting the product to you as soon as possible. Later we will be bringing the Puzzle to you in many other forms. Due to our unique supportive company structure, not only will you be funding the Puzzle, but your order will also assist the funding of other worthwhile causes such as our new totally Plastic Wheelchair, many years in development, that will provide a cost efficient means of mobility to Developing Countries. Others are the Lupus and Heart Foundation, helping find cures for these disorders – we are committed to each of these causes for a variety of reasons.</p>
<p>Simply Puzzling in conjunction with PolyPlastics are proud to be working together with a fantastic team of enthusiasts, committed to bringing the ""Felice 3D-Puzzle"" to the world. With over 60 years commercial experience between our companies we know we have the capacity to bring to you, a new dimension of Mind Bending Puzzle, the ""Felice 3D-Puzzle"".</p>

<p><br/>Welcome to Maia's Indiegogo campaign! I'm putting up this project for those who want to support the game via Paypal to help us reach our goals of a robot designer and the three new worlds of the Telluric variation expansion</p>
<p>$16,000 - Robot Designer</p>
<p>$96,000 - Telluric Variation Expansion</p>
<p>Inspired heavily by the 70's Sci-fi aesthetic, Maia is a colony management simulator where you must keep your colonists safe, fed and happy. Liberally influenced by nineties god games, the game will have a dark sense of humour and more toys to play with than you can shake a Molyneux at.</p>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<p>You must excavate an underground colony to escape the hostile surface of the world. Mine minerals for construction, build rooms to house, feed and entertain your colonists and intricate defenses to protect them from dangerous wildlife.</p>
<p>Battle the hostile environment of intense seismic activity, meteor strikes, solar flares and the alien ecosystem, whilst maintaining the atmosphere, temperature and integrity of your base.</p>
<p>Carefully manage your lighting to control the unstable moods of your colonists, guide your precious robots and to slow the encroaching jungle.</p>
<p>Research sources of power, water and food. Explore the surface and perform science to produce the future technology you need to survive your new home.</p>
<p><strong>Maia supports</strong><em><strong> Linux, Mac </strong></em><strong>and</strong><em><strong> Windows!</strong></em></p>

Welcome to Maia's Indiegogo campaign! I'm putting up this project for those who want to support the game via Paypal to help us reach our goals of a robot designer and the three new worlds of the Telluric variation expansion
$16,000 - Robot Designer
$96,000 - Telluric Variation Expansion
Inspired heavily by the 70's Sci-fi aesthetic, Maia is a colony management simulator where you must keep your colonists safe, fed and happy. Liberally influenced by nineties god games, the game will have a dark sense of humour and more toys to play with than you can shake a Molyneux at.
Gameplay
You must excavate an underground colony to escape the hostile surface of the world. Mine minerals for construction, build rooms to house, feed and entertain your colonists and intricate defenses to protect them from dangerous wildlife.
Battle the hostile environment of intense seismic activity, meteor strikes, solar flares and the alien ecosystem, whilst maintaining the atmosphere, temperature and integrity of your base.
Carefully manage your lighting to control the unstable moods of your colonists, guide your precious robots and to slow the encroaching jungle.
Research sources of power, water and food. Explore the surface and perform science to produce the future technology you need to survive your new home.
Maia supports Linux, Mac and Windows!

<h3>About The Game Crafter</h3>
<p><a href=""https://www.thegamecrafter.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Game Crafter</a> offers game designers an easy-to-use system to make a board game, card game, or custom playing cards. Free templates, instructions, videos, and proofing tools are available to help people create quality products. The service is print on demand and this means that designers can purchase 1 copy or as many as they need.</p>
<p><span>Our community of gamers and game designers has grown to over 24,000 users in just a few years. Designers have created over 20,000 different game titles and many have moved on to successful deals with traditional publishers. Our service has matured over the years with a wide range of new products and higher quality game components.</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Taking It To The Next Level</h3>
<p>We have continued to improve our service over the years and it's an exciting time because designers are now able to make games that look good enough to be sold on the shelves of retailers. The only thing preventing this is the game boxes we produce are not shrink wrapped when they leave our production facility. It's time to change that.</p>
<p>We've always been open to the idea of shrink wrapping the games we make, but it hasn't been a priority because it's not something that we'll make a profit doing. Once you have the machine, the material/labor costs are minimal and those we could easily include in the price of manufacturing the game. However, there is a large upfront cost to buying a high-end shrink wrapping machine and that's what has prevented us from doing it.</p>
<p>However, at this point we've heard from enough people in the community to confirm that there's a real demand for shrink wrapping. Many of you have said that you'd be happy to support a crowdfunded campaign to pay for a shrink wrap solution. We have heard you loud and clear and created this opportunity for you to contribute.</p>

<h3>The Shrink Wrap Machines</h3>
<p>We have researched and found the best shrink wrapping solutions for an on-demand production system like ours. We are presenting 3 different options below and your financial support will determine which machine will be integrated into The Game Crafter's production process.</p>
<p><img alt=""3 Shrink Wrapping Solutions for The Game Crafter Community"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/701146/pictures/full/20130409182533-stretch-goals-cog.001.jpg?1365557139"" src="""" style="""" title=""3 Shrink Wrapping Solutions for The Game Crafter Community""/></p>
<p><strong>Solution 1: Basic Machine ($3,000) - FUNDED!</strong></p>
<p>The basic machine will give us the capability to shrink wrap games after they're manufactured. However, this machine is the slowest of the 3 options and only provides basic functionality with no automation. Therefore, we would not automatically shrink wrap every game that comes off the production line. Instead, it would be a selectable option and it would cost <strong>$.75/game</strong>. While this machine is the cheapest option when it comes to purchase price, the ongoing costs to use it are higher since it's slower and requires more labor.</p>
<p><strong>Solution 2: Advanced Machine ($7,000) - FUNDED!</strong></p>
<p>The advanced machine costs more than double the Basic Machine. However, the cost is justified because this machine is much faster and allows for limited programming and automation. Faster shrink wrapping and less labor means that it would only cost <strong>$.20/game</strong>. This is a huge improvement in ongoing costs versus the Basic Machine and the automation means that <strong>every game</strong> will be shrink wrapped through this process.</p>
<p><strong>Solution 3: Self-Aware Shrink Wrap Robot ($10,000) - FUNDED!</strong></p>
<p>Finally, we have the most efficient (and possibly the scariest) option! The Self-Aware Shrink Wrap Robot! This is truly the best solution because it is the fastest, most capable machine and it streamlines the shrink wrapping process. The automation decreases labor costs and the cost savings allows us to provide an amazing benefit. <strong>Choosing this machine means that shrink wrapping for every game is free, for everyone, forever.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>We expect delivery and setup of the machine to be completed within <strong>56 days </strong>(8 weeks) after the campaign is funded. If possible, we will bring the machine online sooner and begin shrink wrapping all orders.</p>

Additional Stretch Goals


We receive requests for new features and products almost every single day. It's difficult for us to measure demand for new products & features so we thought it would be a great to add them as stretch goals and let the community decide if they want to support them. If all of the goals below are funded then we'll create new goals with even more features & products!

$11,000 - The Medium Pro Game Box is Released - FUNDED!
The Small Pro Game Box has been a HUGE hit with designers and customers. At this stretch goal, we could design and release a telescoping, full-color, custom printable, Medium Pro Game Box. Delivery within 31-days of campaign and goal being funded.
$14,000 Goal - Bi-Fold Chipboard Game Board Released - $2143 TO GO!
This stretch goal would allow us to design and release a new custom printable bi-fold game board. The game board would be 9"" x 18"" and be made of the same chipboard material as the quad-fold game boards we currently offer. Delivery within 45 days of campaign and goal being funded.
Note: Fund the stretch goals above and we'll release new ones!

They are like frequent flier miles from an airline. You can cash them in for special perks on our site. Full details are available here. 
""Is it possible to upgrade my perk to a higher one?""
Yes, follow the instructions provided by Indiegogo.
""Is it possible to purchase 2 or more perks?""
Yes, Indiegogo processes every contribution individually. Just make another contribution and you are all set. Read full answer
""My perk is no longer showing up in the list. What happened?""
Indiegogo only allows 12 active perks to be displayed on a campaign. Therefore, when perks sell out, they will disappear from the list and new perks will be added in their place. You're still getting that perk and there is no reason to worry. In fact, you should be happy you got the perk before it sold out! Congrats!
The Game Crafter Team
JT Smith originally founded The Game Crafter in 2001. He self-published his own game titles under the brand and learned how difficult it was to self-publish a tabletop game. In 2009 he put his experience to use and teamed up with co-founders, Tavis Parker and Jamie Vrbsky, to relaunch The Game Crafter as a print on demand game publisher. The rest is history!

All three co-founders LOVE gaming but they are also serial entrepreneurs and enjoy starting new projects and businesses. Each partner has unique skills that help guarantee success:

JT Smith is an accomplished technical visionary who develops the software behind The Game Crafter website and builds the automation used in the production processes.


Tavis Parker is a passionate marketeer who loves meeting new people and enhancing The Game Crafter brand. He stays busy with promotions, SEO, social media, and copywriting.


Jamie Vrbsky is an experienced operations manager who oversees finances, logistics, and personnel. He's the one who makes sure all of our 700+ game parts are in stock!",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi! I'm Trevor Strunk and you might know me better as Hegelbon on twitter and as the author/host of No Cartridge, a podcast and blog about games. </p>
<p>Thanks to the generosity and support of so many of you, I've been able to make writing about and talking about video games part of my life. The aesthetic and critical approach I've taken has been called unique, welcome, necessary -- but I'm happiest to be contributing to the discourse around games in the best way I know how.</p>
<p>This project is a way for me to expand on that. I want to explore eSports and gaming competition on the ground. And in order to do that, I want to go all-in: building an arcade stick; training up to become competent; and ultimately competing at the highest level (for however briefly that lasts). </p>
<p>In short, this isn't meant as a new No Cartridge or a new ask for the same material -- this is a one-time longform piece that doesn't have a home or publisher -- yet! -- and which I need some capital to pursue. That's where you come in.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>For this project I need three things:</p>
<p>- An arcade stick, basically the controller people use to actually play fighting games instead of mashing keyboard buttons. These are complex things to build, and, frankly, a large part of the project as it stands. The craft involved in the fighting game scene is unparalleled on the controller level and I need to immerse myself in that to tell this story. I expect this will cost between 100-150 dollars.</p>
<p>- A plane ticket to wherever EVO is. This hasn't been announced yet, so who knows where it'll be? Exciting but expensive. </p>
<p>- Entry fees to EVO. See above, though I'm guessing this will run 50-100 dollars.</p>
<p>If I only get partially funded, I expect I'll pursue tips, freelance, etc to supplement. The money will first go to the controller, as I'll need that to start the project in earnest. If I get more than the money, I'll provide added journalism, diaries, et al. Updates here, either way.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project has been described as an eSports version of the classic sports journalism text <i>Paper Lion</i>, and I believe humanizing and complicating eSports as a new model for competitive entertainment is important. I have not seen the on-the-ground, material analysis of this rapidly growing sphere, and I want very much to provide it.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Frankly, the biggest risk is that I'm so terrible at fighting games in a competitive scene that I'm unable to qualify for or attend EVO. To the best of my understanding, this should be moot as anyone may register for EVO, but it's a niggling doubt for sure.</p>
<p>Beyond this, I suppose logistics and the complexity and ambition of the project could get in the way. But I do not doubt my ability to write and produce the work at a high quality and unique level.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>You can share the campaign and suggest stuff for sure! And read my work at no-cartridge.com and listen to the podcast at No Cartridge Audio. The patreon and all is a separate project though, and I want to keep them separate for probably arbitrary reasons, so don't feel compelled or obligated to donate there (though you're of course more than welcome!)</p>

Hello there,
My name is Chris Fernandez. I am a 24 year old photographer based in Edinburgh, Scotland.
My project will act as a commentary on the 'wrong man in the wrong place at the wrong time' genre. Ranging from the likes of North by Northwest to Die Hard, I hope to parody the idea of the Hollywood Every-man; substituting a more contemporary Scottish Every-man in place of the traditional handsome leading male. At the same time, I hope to pay tribute to the style and aesthetics of US and world cinema alike. 
I have been working on this project for the best part of a year, not including the planning, and am currently looking for completion funding to put on exhibitions in Edinburgh, London and Oslo. So far, I have funded the project myself, but looking for a little help printing images, improving PR and renting the exhibition space. 
With any luck, this project will help me establish myself within the field of fine art photography, and ideally; help me find work as a cinematographer.




Funding would really help launch my career and reputation, both locally and internationally. Again, I am looking to exhibit in Edinburgh, London and Oslo. 


What We Need & What You Get
In terms of funding, I am looking to raise £500. This will be spent on printing images for the show; printing out flyers and raising public awareness as to when and where the exhibition will be held; as well as paying for the exhibition space.  Even then, I will be putting up a lot of money myself.
In exchange for funding, I will be more than happy to send out a copy of any requested prints. I have added a couple of raw images from the project to my page. The complete collection will be updated to my website: www.christopherfernandez.com after the exhibition. Please have a look. 


The Impact
The inspiration of this project comes down to my love of film, as well as the success I had with similar, film-style images;
 


A number of film-inspired images went down well before and I was able to sell several prints; I am hoping to do the same with this upcoming project.

<h3><strong>Blitztream and Third Epoch</strong></h3>
<p>Blitztream believes games can make the world better. Our games are a lens through which to advocate human potential.</p>
<p>Our first iOS and Android game, Third Epoch, is an epic turn-based “3T” (trading, travel, tactics) space game of spaceships, discovery, and adventure.</p>
<p>We’ve taken well-loved elements of classic space strategy games, and redesigned them with a positive bent:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Fight with brains, not brawn</em>. Use scientific tools, instead of conventional weapons, to neutralize dangerous space anomalies and disable hostile ships.</li>
<li>
<em>Personality based perspective</em>. Are you a thinker or doer? Do you bend the rules or play by the book? Your actions determine who you are and what you discover.</li>
<li>
<em>Discovery driven missions</em>. From the Cryptoliths on Zamzummin to the Sealed Vessel in the Outer Rim, follow assignments that gradually reveal epic cosmic mysteries.</li>
<li>
<em>Travel interstellar trade routes</em>. Coffee, tea, spices, rare metals... The universe is criss-crossed with trade routes defined by the culture and histories of their different regions.</li>
<li>
<em>Cinematic replays</em>. See the outcomes of your tactical decisions played back in exciting cinematic sequences.</li>
</ul>
<p>Third Epoch is free-to-play. You can top-up with in-app micro-purchases when you need to or <br/>want to.</p>
<p>The scope of the game - ships, star systems, tools, characters, and stories - will expand over a series of three campaigns, with each one building up to the next epic cosmic event. Each introduces new interstellar civilizations from beyond the known universe with mission arcs that challenge important social, environmental, economic, and scientific themes.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>We’ve been working hard for the past year on our pilot version. Third Epoch:Rising is a prelude to the first campaign that introduces players to a scaled-down version of the game and universe. We’ll gradually expand these over incremental updates. Rising will launch with the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>3 initial “star-system” distance ship classes, with multiple models per ship class.</li>
<li>1 star cluster (known as The Bean Route) with 5 star systems and 9 space stations.</li>
<li>15 initial different tools that can be mounted to ships.</li>
<li>3-5 major mission arcs.</li>
<li>Single player mode</li>
</ul>
<p>But we want to give players more. So we’re asking the community of space game fans to play a role in expanding the Third Epoch universe.</p>
<p>Crowdfunding will enable us to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>12 star clusters with complete star systems</li>
<li>20 story-arc multi-assignment missions featuring point-of-view characters</li>
<li>10 new ships from Freighter and a Explorer classes</li>
<li>Level 2 and 3 tools</li>
<li>Asynchronous multiplayer</li>
<li>A whole bunch of refinements and improvements to the UI</li>
</ul>
<p>We’re offering some amazing rewards starting as low as $1. AR mini-cards of ships complete with 3D exploded views, detailed specs, and histories. Gorgeous AR wall posters with zoom-ins and information on planets and star systems in the universe. A limited edition book all about Third Epoch’s trade routes, ships and technology, characters, and board game rules you can play with your AR mini-cards. Top tier backers get to co-create parts of the universe with us. We’ll immortalize elite backers by including your ideas into mission arcs and essential characters. Everyone who backs us automatically receives extra Ambers when they start the game. And, since Blitztream believes in social good, we’re committing 10% of our revenue to sponsor worthwhile causes, including organizations like Child’s Play and Right To Play that bring the gift of games and sports to under-privileged kids.</p>

<br/><p></p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>A lot of game designers and publishers in the mobile space are simply making cheap disposable games.  We have a different mission.  We believe games have the same artistic responsibility as literature and film.  There’s enormous potential for games to have a very positive influence on how we envision and consequently create the future.</p>
<p>With Third Epoch, we wanted to redefine epic gaming on mobile platforms, by creating the first ""hardcore science fiction"" game. By this, we mean using our fictional universe in the format of an epic game to explore possibilities in context to social ideas.</p>
<p>We realized there was an opportunity to do something different - to create a modern take on a game focused instead on exploration, discovery, and intelligent heroism - and dispel the negative stereotypes games have been criticized for. Epic cosmic plots, culturally-diverse interstellar trade-routes, non-destructive combat, topical mission arcs, and a personality-based character alignment system are all elements we re-imagined for this purpose.</p>

Blitztream and Third Epoch
Blitztream believes games can make the world better. Our games are a lens through which to advocate human potential.
Our first iOS and Android game, Third Epoch, is an epic turn-based “3T” (trading, travel, tactics) space game of spaceships, discovery, and adventure.
We’ve taken well-loved elements of classic space strategy games, and redesigned them with a positive bent:


Fight with brains, not brawn. Use scientific tools, instead of conventional weapons, to neutralize dangerous space anomalies and disable hostile ships.

Personality based perspective. Are you a thinker or doer? Do you bend the rules or play by the book? Your actions determine who you are and what you discover.

Discovery driven missions. From the Cryptoliths on Zamzummin to the Sealed Vessel in the Outer Rim, follow assignments that gradually reveal epic cosmic mysteries.

Travel interstellar trade routes. Coffee, tea, spices, rare metals... The universe is criss-crossed with trade routes defined by the culture and histories of their different regions.

Cinematic replays. See the outcomes of your tactical decisions played back in exciting cinematic sequences.

Third Epoch is free-to-play. You can top-up with in-app micro-purchases when you need to or want to.
The scope of the game - ships, star systems, tools, characters, and stories - will expand over a series of three campaigns, with each one building up to the next epic cosmic event. Each introduces new interstellar civilizations from beyond the known universe with mission arcs that challenge important social, environmental, economic, and scientific themes.










What We Need & What You Get
We’ve been working hard for the past year on our pilot version. Third Epoch:Rising is a prelude to the first campaign that introduces players to a scaled-down version of the game and universe. We’ll gradually expand these over incremental updates. Rising will launch with the following:

3 initial “star-system” distance ship classes, with multiple models per ship class.
1 star cluster (known as The Bean Route) with 5 star systems and 9 space stations.
15 initial different tools that can be mounted to ships.
3-5 major mission arcs.
Single player mode

But we want to give players more. So we’re asking the community of space game fans to play a role in expanding the Third Epoch universe.
Crowdfunding will enable us to do the following:

12 star clusters with complete star systems
20 story-arc multi-assignment missions featuring point-of-view characters
10 new ships from Freighter and a Explorer classes
Level 2 and 3 tools
Asynchronous multiplayer
A whole bunch of refinements and improvements to the UI

We’re offering some amazing rewards starting as low as $1. AR mini-cards of ships complete with 3D exploded views, detailed specs, and histories. Gorgeous AR wall posters with zoom-ins and information on planets and star systems in the universe. A limited edition book all about Third Epoch’s trade routes, ships and technology, characters, and board game rules you can play with your AR mini-cards. Top tier backers get to co-create parts of the universe with us. We’ll immortalize elite backers by including your ideas into mission arcs and essential characters. Everyone who backs us automatically receives extra Ambers when they start the game. And, since Blitztream believes in social good, we’re committing 10% of our revenue to sponsor worthwhile causes, including organizations like Child’s Play and Right To Play that bring the gift of games and sports to under-privileged kids.



The Impact
A lot of game designers and publishers in the mobile space are simply making cheap disposable games.  We have a different mission.  We believe games have the same artistic responsibility as literature and film.  There’s enormous potential for games to have a very positive influence on how we envision and consequently create the future.
With Third Epoch, we wanted to redefine epic gaming on mobile platforms, by creating the first ""hardcore science fiction"" game. By this, we mean using our fictional universe in the format of an epic game to explore possibilities in context to social ideas.
We realized there was an opportunity to do something different - to create a modern take on a game focused instead on exploration, discovery, and intelligent heroism - and dispel the negative stereotypes games have been criticized for. Epic cosmic plots, culturally-diverse interstellar trade-routes, non-destructive combat, topical mission arcs, and a personality-based character alignment system are all elements we re-imagined for this purpose.


Other Ways You Can Help
We hope that if you’re a fan of science fiction and turn-based “3T” space games and share our belief in games that have a positive influence, you’ll get behind our project and back us. You'll be the fuel for the start of a paradigm shifting movement in gaming. However, you can also help by spreading the word and sharing Blitztream and Third Epoch with your friends. Add your Like to our Facebook page here - www.facebook.com/Blitztream - and follow us on Twitter - www.twitter.com/Blitztream. Or use the Share tools on Indiegogo to reach out to your social network. Either way, we’d love to know what you think, so leave us your comments. ------------------------------Blitztream et Third Epoch

Blitztream croit que les jeux peuvent rendre le monde meilleur. Nos jeux sont un prisme à travers lequel nous préconisons le potentiel humain.
""Third Epoch"" est notre premier jeu iOS et Android, qui est une épopée dans l'espace de jeu de vaisseaux spatiaux, la découverte et l'aventure.
Nous avons pris les éléments appréciés des autres jeux de stratégie classiques et l'avons créé avec un esprit positif:

Combattre avec l’intelligence plutôt que la force physique. Utiliser des outils scientifiques au lieu des armes conventionnelles pour neutraliser des éléments hostiles.
Personnalité évolutive. Êtes-vous impulsif ou réfléchi? Contournez-vous les règles ou les respectez-vous? Vos actions déterminent qui vous êtes et ce que vous découvrez.
 Missions d'exploration. Des Cryptoliths sur Zamzoummin jusqu'aux vaisseaux navigants aux lointaines contrées de l'univers. Recevez des affectations qui vous révèlent peu à peu des mystères cosmiques.
Voyagez sur des routes commerciales interstellaires. Café, thé, épices et métaux rares... L'univers est sillonnée de routes commerciales définies par la culture et l'histoire de leurs différentes régions.
Rediffusion cinématographique. Voir les résultats de vos décisions tactiques dans des séquences en temps réelle.


""Third Epoch"" est un jeu gratuit. Par contre, il sera possible d'acheter des extras à même le jeu lorsque vous le désirez.

Nos besoin et ce que vous obtenez

Nous avons travaillé dur pour la dernière année sur notre version première. ""Third Epoch: Rising"" est un prélude à la première campagne qui introduit les joueurs à une version réduite du jeu et de l'univers. Nous allons progressivement l’accroître aux cours de mises à jour. ""Rising"" lancera ce qui suit:

3 catégories de vaisseaux spatiaux, avec de multiples sous-modèles par catégories, 
1 amas stellaire avec 5 systèmes solaires et 9 stations spatiales, 
15 outils qui peuvent être montés à bord des vaisseaux, 
3 à 5 missions majeurs,
Possibilité de jouer avec un seul joueur.


Mais nous voulons donner aux joueurs plus. Nous demandons donc à la communauté des amateurs de jeux spatiaux à jouer un rôle dans l'expansion de ""Third Epoch"".
Les fonds amassés par cette campagne nous permettrons de faire ce qui suit:

12 amas stellaires avec des systèmes solaires complets,
20 missions avec différentes affectations présentant de nouveaux personnages, 
10 nouveaux vaisseaux de cargo et explorateur, 
Augmentation de la performance des outils, 
Multijoueur asynchrone, 
Plusieurs ajustements et améliorations de l'interface d'utilisateur. 

Nous offrons des récompenses intéressantes en échange de vos contributions commençant à aussi peu que 1$ telles que des cartes de vaisseaux en réalité augmentée avec des vues 3D éclatées, des spécifications détaillées et leur histoire, des affiches murales en réalité augmentée avec l'information sur les planètes et systèmes stellaires, un livre en édition limitée de l'univers ""Third Epoch"", leurs vaisseaux, technologie et personnages. Les contributeurs de catégorie ""Rear Admiral"" et supérieur pourront co-créer une parties de l'univers avec nous. Nous allons immortaliser les contributeurs ""Admiral"" en incluant vos idées de mission et les personnages essentiels. Tout le monde qui nous supportent reçoivent automatiquement des ""ambres"" (monnaie) supplémentaires au début de la partie. Et puisque Blitztream croit en les causes sociales, nous nous engageons à donner 10% de notre chiffre d'affaires à parrainer des causes valables, y compris des organisations telles que ""Child's Play"" et ""Right to Play"".

L'impact

Un grand nombre de concepteurs et éditeurs de jeux dans le monde mobile ne font que produire des jeux jetables à bas prix. Nous avons une mission différente. Nous croyons que les jeux ont la même responsabilité artistique que la littérature et le cinéma. Il y a un énorme potentiel pour les jeux d'avoir une influence très positive sur la façon dont nous envisageons l'avenir.Avec ""Third Epoch"", nous voulons redéfinir les jeux mémorables sur les plate-formes mobiles en explorant les possibilités dans le contexte d'idées sociales.
Nous avons réalisé qu'il y avait une occasion de faire quelque chose de différent, de créer une version moderne d'un jeu axé plutôt sur l'exploration, la découverte et l'héroïsme intelligent et dissiper les stéréotypes négatifs. Les combats non-destructif et des personnalités à caractère évolutif sont tous des éléments que nous recréons dans ce but.

Use your tentacle arm to perform many unusual office tasks. Master woobly tentacle physics and try to not destroy all life on the planets that you take care of. Every day brings completely new challenges. USEFUL LINKS
Playable demo on Itch.io

For more detailed information check out the press kit

  There  won't be time for you to get bored in this game as EVERY day is a completely new challenge. On Monday you will be fighting bug infestation, Tuesdays are usually the days when someone tries to rob us, Wednesday might be the casual day! If these assignments sound too easy to you then we guarantee that the more experienced you are the more interesting challenges you will get! And we mean it. Godly Corp is divided into levels / days, and every day presents a new challenge. Player will be forced to multitask and master the tentacle mechanics to complete the level. Each level takes 4-7 minutes to complete (although some of theme might take couple tries since they are pretty challenging) At beginning of each level player will be provided with instructions and when ready, the start button can be pushed to begin the level. Sometimes you will have to 'survive' until the end of the shift and sometimes you will have to complete some task before the clock rings. The levels themselves also often contain different twists that change rules mid level.All levels take place next to your desk but the environment often changes. Sometimes you will be closed in your cubicle, on other days you will have view on the whole office and on some days your cubicle might get launched in space to perform some special assignments.  Most of the fun comes from game presentation, hilarious tentacle mechanics and tasks that you have to perform. At the end of the level, your performance is evaluated. You might try to improve your score or switch to harder difficulty to get better modifier. Godly Corp is inspired by games like Surgeon Simulator, Octodad and Goat Simulator.      Godly Corp is mostly done, at least for PC. There are 11 levels already done and polished and another 9 that are still in progress. During the beta testing phase, tester suggested doing VR version. However we didn't plan the budget for extended development time that making this port would take. We  also need to get necessary equipment to be able to start working on VR.   Perks and rewards in detailsApplicant 5$ - We really appreciate your support and want to thank you by putting your name in credits in backers section.Intern 10$ - You will get Steam key for Godly Corp as soon as game is released and your name will be in the credits.Office Assistant 20$ - Get all perks above but right after the campaign finishes, you will get Steam key. So far game is available on Windows, Linux and Mac. When campaign ends, we will start working on VR. You will be able to play the game whenever you want and check progress and suggest some changes in Godly Corp.Virtual Assistant 50$ - Your recorder audio clip will be in the pool of songs that radio is playing during levels! The clip shouldn't be longer than 15-20 seconds.

city with a headache and bad bruises, not sure about what happened. They
 came and destroyed everything, every city. Now, Earth is lost and you 
need to leave the planet. In this RPG, you'll need to find your way out 
of Earth using alien technology, exploring new solar systems, finding 
plants, animals and minerals to colonize a planet of your choice - 
swamp, ruined alien city, forest, desert and even an ocean biome. Once 
you've settled, you'll rule and build a city, a military force, always 
with the ultimate objective in mind - to retake what's yours. This 
multiplayer RPG will set players against each other or in cooperation 
and they'll be able to trade, battle among themselves - on ground or in 
spaceships - or just sit in a bar and roleplay.

 Help us develop this old school rpg for pc. Explore new planets, collect plants, animals and minerals to start your own biome. Earth was invaded and it's your task to reclaim it.The year is 2016 and we have made contact. You wake up in a devastated 
city with a headache and bad bruises, not sure about what happened. They
 came and destroyed everything, every city. Now, Earth is lost and you 
need to leave the planet. In this RPG, you'll need to find your way out 
of Earth using alien technology, exploring new solar systems, finding 
plants, animals and minerals to colonize a planet of your choice - 
swamp, ruined alien city, forest, desert and even an ocean biome. Once 
you've settled, you'll rule and build a city, a military force, always 
with the ultimate objective in mind - to retake what's yours. This 
multiplayer RPG will set players against each other or in cooperation 
and they'll be able to trade, battle among themselves - on ground or in 
spaceships - or just sit in a bar and roleplay.
- 8 attributes: Strenght, Aim, Dexterity, Intelligence, Computer, Engineering, Charisma;
- Over 50 skills to choose, including: Bargain (Int) - Hack System

<h3>Sollindae (Short summary)</h3>
<p>    Sollindae is a game which my friend Jett and I created a year ago. It was originally programmed with the programming language Python, and was completely text-based. The project was almost completely abandoned, and it was a very very small game, not much code. Recently, however, we have decided to revamp the entire thing with graphics and an <em>actual story (INSANE!).</em> This new game would be made with a program called RPG Maker (More specifically, RPG Maker VX Ace), and would have a lot more to do. An immersive story, amazing music, a great map with complete free-roaming ability, as well as tons of side quests. Sollindae, in short, is an innovative twist on the classic 2D RPGs that many gamers would agree are some of the best retro games ever. We're taking elements from modern games such as The Elder Scrolls series (Story, side stories, free roaming capability, and characters with personality), and putting it into a grand indie game.</p>
<p>    Sollindae is a game that will revolutionize the way we see 2D RPGs forever.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>In order of importance, what we need is:</p>
<ul>
<li>RPG Maker VX Ace, the program that we're going to make the game with. (~$70)</li>
<li>RPG Maker DS Resource Pack, an amazingly large resource pack for RPG Maker, with everything we need to make the game more awesome! (~$30)</li>
<li>Posters for certain contributors (~$100)</li>
<li>T-Shirts, for certain contributors (~$31)</li>
<li>Indie Graphics Builder, a graphics pack that allows you to 'make your own' graphics by combining different elements (~$200)</li>
</ul>
<p>    That adds up to $431, so the extra $69 is mostly to bring up our goal to the minimum amount required by IndieGoGo. But, we also would love to be able to repay our composers for what we assume will be a great job, and most of all, we may have extra expenses (advertisement, an actual website, etc.), and as well shipping fees for shipping the contributor's items. All contributors will get their names in the credits</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We believe that this game is a good example of the way that technology can bring people together to do things easier; Back in the 1980's, you had to own a big corporation, pay artists, composers, and programmers thousands of dollars to complete a fourth of the game. Then, you had to get money for manufacturing floppy disks, get with TV stations to advertise, and then with retailers so you can sell it. At this point, it's the luck of the draw whether or not you'll sell enough. Nowadays, we can just do it all ourselves. Or in our case, get together with people in seconds. </p>
<p>    We got composers to make music for free. We can go and buy all the graphics we need by entering in a credit card number and clicking a button and then downloading a file in a minute. Then, we put it all together with a program over a much smaller period of time. The entire game is a collaborative effort over this massive thing we call the internet. We don't have to meet in real life at all. Indie games don't require too much advertisement, either, we can just spread the word online and others will share it with their friends and so on and so forth. Help us make this another great example of the usefulness of technology, and its abilities.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute money, there are many ways you can help.</p>

<li>IndieGoGo has an awesome share tool, use it to share with your friends!</li>
<li>Just spread the word. Tell someone in person, through fax, or even snail mail! Any hype we can get is helpful!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Extra, ""Legal"" Stuff</h3>
<p>    Upon recieving a copy of the game, its soundtrack, or a beta version, by downloading, you have agreed not to distribute the game to anyone other than yourself. Piracy on the internet is a big problem, but please note: We don't support SOPA or PIPA sort of ideas, but we want to be paid when someone gets our game. We will have spent a lot of time on this game by the time we release it; We want to be paid for our hard work, so don't distribute copies of the full game, it's beta, or the soundtrack!</p>

<p>The game of <strong>Lair</strong> is played in two phases - <strong>Design &amp; Exploration.</strong></p>

<h3>DESIGN THE ADVENTURE</h3>
<p>To begin, each player sets a screen in front of them to preserve secrecy, and then places their walls, monsters, traps, treasures, and artifacts <i>anywhere they want</i> inside the grid, thus creating their own <strong>unique dungeon</strong>.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476204585/ojztriz0f9gjf1dj2ayw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Players design their own lair every game, providing endless replay value!</i></p>
<h3>EXPLORE THE UNKNOWN</h3>
<p>Once both players have declared their lair complete, the action begins - and it is time to explore your opponents' lair. Each player reveals the location of the HERO and DARK LORD in their own lair, and these coordinates are recorded by the opponent onto their trusty <strong>gridmap.</strong> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476204492/eqo5c8pmonvjxmzdljxa.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Players will use their gridmap to navigate through their opponents' lair!</i></p>
<p>With only this information to guide you, players will then use their gridmap to navigate through the dungeon, not knowing what dangers - or treasures - may come with every step. As your opponent moves your Hero throughout the lair, they must reveal the contents of each coordinate to you, resulting in suspenseful, interactive gameplay like no other!</p>
<h3>MONSTERS</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476207342/ptdtgizawjbd0mjyrvlw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Lurking throughout the lair are a legion of undead monsters waiting to bring on your demise. Whenever a monster is encountered, <strong>combat</strong> immediately ensues - and both players roll the dice against each other, adding any bonuses to determine who wins.</p>
<p>Here is a look at the foul creatures you may encounter in the Lair:</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476330529/fxk66miv0k0e81etli0t.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>TREASURE</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476210663/mgris21uhuf7nbivjjuw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Finding treasure in the lair will allow players to draw an <strong>Item</strong> card from the deck, which will increase their chances of defeating the Dark Lord before their opponent. </p>
<h3>TRAPS</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476210885/parplu5eyvsoqnfqtscm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>What lair would be complete without a set of deadly traps waiting to snag an unsuspecting adventurer? Fall into these and you'll <strong>miss your next turn.</strong></p>
<h3>ARTIFACTS</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476211087/e2kunm4tub02iwvpumwn.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Powerful weaponry and legendary armor lay scattered throughout the lair, and will <strong>permanently boost</strong> your combat abilities when discovered!</p>
<h3>ITEMS</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476214754/vvqmycsdp8tjq57dtzlh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Whenever a player finds a treasure chest in the dungeon, or defeats a monster in combat, they may draw an Item card from the deck. Items add a <strong>great deal of flavour</strong> to the experience of <strong>Lair</strong>, and using them wisely during the game can determine whether you prevail - or perish!</p>

<p>Tired of playing the same old card games? Neither are we! However, Lair is a bonafide <strong>board game</strong> completely<i> bursting</i> with tons of <strong>vibrant components</strong>, each of which have been meticulously designed to be visually appealing in nature.</p>

<p>The funds we raise will go straight into the production of the game, artwork on various components, component upgrades, and asset retouches. We've set the goal at $2500, which is the absolute<strong> minimum amount</strong> needed to produce the game. </p>

Lair is an exciting fantasy adventure board game in which players customize their own labyrinth full of treasures, traps, and monsters – and then bravely traverse their opponent's dungeon in hopes of defeating the evil Dark Lord!
Implementing an innovative map-making mechanic, Lair guarantees that no two games are ever the same - and the simultaneous combat & movement system keeps both players actively engaged throughout, regardless of whose turn it is.
Check out our website at LAIRGAME.CA to find out more!


Lair is one of 5 finalists in Hasbro's Gaming Lab Contest! Chosen from over 640 games across the world, Lair has the chance to become the Grand Prize winner and receive $25,000, a trip to Hasbro headquarters, and the opportunity to work alongside industry professionals who will assist in the production of the game.  
Your support in this campaign is crucial! We need to SMASH our goal, with at least 100 unique backers - so any pledge will be greatly appreciated. however, no matter what happens in the contest, this game will be produced and delivered to your doorstep!

Lair is founded on a rich, engaging backstory that takes place in the wondrous world of Ellandria, a mythical land steeped in lore & magic! Players can immerse themselves in this tale through the rulebook, the standalone graphic novel, and future expansions set to come.



The game of Lair is played in two phases - Design & Exploration.


DESIGN THE ADVENTURE
To begin, each player sets a screen in front of them to preserve secrecy, and then places their walls, monsters, traps, treasures, and artifacts anywhere they want inside the grid, thus creating their own unique dungeon.

Players design their own lair every game, providing endless replay value!
EXPLORE THE UNKNOWN
Once both players have declared their lair complete, the action begins - and it is time to explore your opponents' lair. Each player reveals the location of the HERO and DARK LORD in their own lair, and these coordinates are recorded by the opponent onto their trusty gridmap. 

Players will use their gridmap to navigate through their opponents' lair!
With only this information to guide you, players will then use their gridmap to navigate through the dungeon, not knowing what dangers - or treasures - may come with every step. As your opponent moves your Hero throughout the lair, they must reveal the contents of each coordinate to you, resulting in suspenseful, interactive gameplay like no other!
MONSTERS

Lurking throughout the lair are a legion of undead monsters waiting to bring on your demise. Whenever a monster is encountered, combat immediately ensues - and both players roll the dice against each other, adding any bonuses to determine who wins.
Here is a look at the foul creatures you may encounter in the Lair:

TREASURE

Finding treasure in the lair will allow players to draw an Item card from the deck, which will increase their chances of defeating the Dark Lord before their opponent. 
TRAPS

What lair would be complete without a set of deadly traps waiting to snag an unsuspecting adventurer? Fall into these and you'll miss your next turn.
ARTIFACTS

Powerful weaponry and legendary armor lay scattered throughout the lair, and will permanently boost your combat abilities when discovered!
ITEMS

Whenever a player finds a treasure chest in the dungeon, or defeats a monster in combat, they may draw an Item card from the deck. Items add a great deal of flavour to the experience of Lair, and using them wisely during the game can determine whether you prevail - or perish!

Tired of playing the same old card games? Neither are we! However, Lair is a bonafide board game completely bursting with tons of vibrant components, each of which have been meticulously designed to be visually appealing in nature.

Here's a list of everything you'll receive in the box:


We've put together some great perks to offer our backers!


Achieving our base funding goal will ensure that we'll be able to publish Lair and bring it into production - however, if we exceed our  goal, we can start adding TONS of more exciting content and components to the game!
Here is a list of stretch goals that would allow us to expand the game tremendously - let's do our best to get them unlocked!


The funds we raise will go straight into the production of the game, artwork on various components, component upgrades, and asset retouches. We've set the goal at $2500, which is the absolute minimum amount needed to produce the game. 




Backing the project isn't just about funds - you can help us by sharing this page, spreading the word to your friends and online communities, and leaving links in your trace. Check out our website at LAIRGAME.CA and follow us on Social Media!",33.0,0,"1 Campaign

<ul><li>
<b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">About us:</b><br/>
</li></ul>
<p></p>
<p>We are an individual game studio called WnMStudio. We've already deployed some Android games on Amazon and WP games on Windows Phone Store.  We have a programmer, a ui designer and a game artist.</p>
<p>This time we are building an online card battle game. I used to be a fan of YuGiOh card game and MTG, I tried to make my friends play these interesting games with me, but they gave up as soon as they found it's very difficult to understand complex rules. So I decided to develop this game - <i>War Of Mortal</i>. </p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>
<b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">About game:</b><br/>
</li></ul>
<p></p>
<p>This card game uses an extremely simple rule: there is only one type of card. You put 30 cards in your deck(no more than 3 for cards with the same name), when the game starts you and your opponent both summon a card which we call ""Servant"" on the ground. Each card has HP and ATK properties, and the two cards on the ground fight each other until one of them(or both of them) lost all HP (Damage = ATK), then you summon a new card to replace the dead one. The first one lost all cards loses. If both lost all cards at the same time, it's a draw.</p>
<p>The fun part of this card battle is a lot of cards have special effects. Such as ""when opponent is a dragon, this card gain 500 ATK"" or ""When this card was summoned, destroy opponent servant immediately"" or ""This card reverses opponent's DESTROY effect (exchange target)"". These effects make the battle full of fun. And players have to pay a lot of attention on how to form their deck and they'll pray for good luck in battle.</p>
<p>WOM will be an online game so that NO ONE CAN CHEAT. We belive this is very important for a game focus on ""competition"". </p>
<p>And also, that's why we need fund.</p>
<p><b>PS:</b></p>
<p><b>1.) <i>War of Mortal</i> will be published on Android and iOS platform. We are also considering about publishing it on Steam (means PC platform). </b></p>
<p><b>2.) We are going to print some cards and try to sell them, just like what Konami did.</b></p>
<p><b>3.) </b><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We've made the decision that War of Mortal will NOT be a free game. Players will get some free game time at the begining of the game, but they need to pay for further game. Also, there will be no In-App-Purcasing items.

<p><b>We keep doing some changes so please check ""Update"" tab.</b></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p></p>
<ul><li>
<b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Why we need fund:</b><br/>
</li></ul>
<p></p>
<p>There are mainly three part of costing.</p>
<p>1.) Unity3D pro lisence. We are developing an online game so free lisence is not an option (free lisence does not support socket function). Unity3D pro lisence with Android and iOS support cost $3,000 in all;</p>
<p>2.) Game art work. As you know, card game needs hundreds of images. This part we have two options. One is buy images at a low price, which are all images used by other projects. The other is to hire more artists to draw our brand new images, which is much more expensive.</p>
<p>3.) Server cost. This is also easy to understand as we are developing an online game. We've decided to use AWS (Amazon Web Service) as our game server. If we have a lot of users, that's a lot of money.</p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>
<b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Why flexible funding:</b><br/>
</li></ul>
<p></p>
<p>As you may wondering this, let me explain.</p>
<p>Usually, if a game project cannot collect enough money, it should not be started. But this game is our dream, we have to make it work. No matter how much money we can collect here, we'll finish this game under any condition. So every help we get from you makes our game better. But if we can't move you, we'll change a way to get money (maybe borrow some) to continue develop this game.</p>
<p>So don't worry, this is more like a presale. You'll sure to get what you paid for.</p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>
<b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">What will you get:</b><br/>
</li></ul>
<p></p>
<p>As we said WOM is a free game with In-App-Purchasing items, contributors will get a secret code which can become money in the game. </p>
<p>Also don't forget this is a card game. You may also put yourself in the game as a strong but rare card, or not so strong but common card. You can even decide the card image.</p>
<p>And if you help us really a lot, you may get a physical copy of our the most rare card (God race:P) which will never be printed again (WE PROMISE!).</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p></p>
<ul><li>
<b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">What differences will you make:</b><br/>
</li></ul>
<p></p>
<p>More money means more cards and better servers, which directly means a better game. And that's just what we need the most. You are making great differences to this game's quality.</p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>
<b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">What's the risk:</b><br/>
</li></ul>
<p></p>
<p>The only risk we have is that ""It's not good enough"". There will be no risk of ""We cannot finish that"", as I said, this game have to be finished.</p>

About us:


We are an individual game studio called WnMStudio. We've already deployed some Android games on Amazon and WP games on Windows Phone Store.  We have a programmer, a ui designer and a game artist.
This time we are building an online card battle game. I used to be a fan of YuGiOh card game and MTG, I tried to make my friends play these interesting games with me, but they gave up as soon as they found it's very difficult to understand complex rules. So I decided to develop this game - War Of Mortal. 


About game:


This card game uses an extremely simple rule: there is only one type of card. You put 30 cards in your deck(no more than 3 for cards with the same name), when the game starts you and your opponent both summon a card which we call ""Servant"" on the ground.

The first one lost all cards loses. If both lost all cards at the same time, it's a draw.
The fun part of this card battle is a lot of cards have special effects. Such as ""when opponent is a dragon, this card gain 500 ATK"" or ""When this card was summoned, destroy opponent servant immediately"" or ""This card reverses opponent's DESTROY effect (exchange target)"". These effects make the battle full of fun. And players have to pay a lot of attention on how to form their deck and they'll pray for good luck in battle.
WOM will be an online game so that NO ONE CAN CHEAT. We belive this is very important for a game focus on ""competition"". 
And also, that's why we need fund.
PS:
1.) War of Mortal will be published on Android and iOS platform. We are also considering about publishing it on Steam (means PC platform). 
2.) We are going to print some cards and try to sell them, just like what Konami did.
3.) We've made the decision that War of Mortal will NOT be a free game. Players will get some free game time at the begining of the game, but they need to pay for further game. Also, there will be no In-App-Purcasing items. Only by this way we can make sure our game is fair to every players.
We keep doing some changes so please check ""Update"" tab.



What We Need & What You Get


Why we need fund:


There are mainly three part of costing.
1.) Unity3D pro lisence. We are developing an online game so free lisence is not an option (free lisence does not support socket function). Unity3D pro lisence with Android and iOS support cost $3,000 in all;
2.) Game art work. As you know, card game needs hundreds of images. This part we have two options. One is buy images at a low price, which are all images used by other projects. The other is to hire more artists to draw our brand new images, which is much more expensive.
3.) Server cost. This is also easy to understand as we are developing an online game. We've decided to use AWS (Amazon Web Service) as our game server. If we have a lot of users, that's a lot of money.


Why flexible funding:


As you may wondering this, let me explain.
Usually, if a game project cannot collect enough money, it should not be started. But this game is our dream, we have to make it work. No matter how much money we can collect here, we'll finish this game under any condition. So every help we get from you makes our game better. But if we can't move you, we'll change a way to get money (maybe borrow some) to continue develop this game.
So don't worry, this is more like a presale. You'll sure to get what you paid for.


What will you get:


As we said WOM is a free game with In-App-Purchasing items, contributors will get a secret code which can become money in the game. 
Also don't forget this is a card game. You may also put yourself in the game as a strong but rare card, or not so strong but common card. You can even decide the card image.
And if you help us really a lot, you may get a physical copy of our the most rare card (God race:P) which will never be printed again (WE PROMISE!).



The Impact


What differences will you make:


More money means more cards and better servers, which directly means a better game. And that's just what we need the most. You are making great differences to this game's quality.


What's the risk:


The only risk we have is that ""It's not good enough"". There will be no risk of ""We cannot finish that"", as I said, this game have to be finished.



If we still cannot move you
That's a sad story TAT. Look into my eyes TAT. T.T. Q.Q. QAQ. TVT
Still not moving you? That's alright. Just, please make more people know this game. You must know some people who like MTG or YuGiOh games. Just tell him/her about WOM.

<p>Hello to all! We are a small team, passionate about game development. About three years ago we had the idea about Urban Galaxy Online. After setting the basic outline of the game we started the development on our spare time.</p>
<p>Since then, the game has evolved and, we believe, matured to something bigger than a ""garage project"". With our passion as a driver we have made bold changes to the gameplay and tested it with some really helpful folks. You can check out the latest Urban Galaxy updates on our site at <a href=""http://www.urbangalaxyonline.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Our Site"">www.urbangalaxyonline.com</a>. From there, you can access our forum, twitter and facebook pages.</p>
<p>So here we stand, on the final line to our first official release of Urban Galaxy Online, asking for your help in finalizing, tweaking and releasing our child to the public.</p>
<h2>About Urban Galaxy Online</h2>
<p>Urban Galaxy Online, or UG in short, is a 3D Massively Multiplayer Online Game, placed inside a futuristic megapolis called Anassin. The game runs within the web browser, requiring no client download. We tried to take advantage of this feature in order to include additional staff in the game's web page that users might find useful, such as  social features and walkthroughs that are accessible directly from the web while playing the game.</p>
<h3>Basic features</h3>
<p><img alt=""Urban galaxy in-game shot"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.urbangalaxyonline.com/indiegogo/ug-uiview.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Urban galaxy in-game shot""/></p>
<p>Now on to the game! In UG you can find some good old mmorpg stuff like collecting xp points and upgrading your character through leveling, distributing skill points on class-specific skill trees, completing quest storylines, crafting new items using blueprints, parting with other players, upgrading your ship and gear by looting mobs or accesing city shops, selling stuff in the auction house etc.</p>
<p>In addition, the game features both PvE and PvP areas, daily quests and group fight against powerfull raid bosses.</p>
<h3>The setting</h3>
<p><img alt=""Player classes ships"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.urbangalaxyonline.com/indiegogo/game-classes.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Player classes ships""/></p>
<p>The setting is somewhat futuristic retro, somewhat sci-fi. The player chooses among three classes: the Smuggler, the Mercenary or the Carrier, and navigates a vehicle of his/her choice around the city.</p>
<p>We have tried to include features to the city setting to make it look like a living organism. So in the city you can find various animated objects such as vertical train-elevators, ships movement over the docks, traffic etc.</p>
<p><img alt=""Train Elevator preview"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.urbangalaxyonline.com/indiegogo/train-elevator.gif"" src="""" style="""" title=""Train Elevator preview""/></p>
<p>Also, we have added in-game ad-banners with ""virtual advertisments"" to further enhance the world story of conflict among the in-game corporations.</p>
<p>Another feature on the living setting are the random events happening in the game that may affect a player, such as random meteor showers, earthquakes, buildings set on fire etc.</p>
<p>Trying to make the city appear as lively as possible, we are trying to add more complex behaviours such as fire brigade vehicles trying to put out fires, police vehicles patroling areas and attacking local gang ships etc.</p>
<h3>The story</h3>
<p>Anassin, the city where the game takes place, is the capital city of the ""Dual Solar Empire"", a center of commercial, political and cultural activities. The city has entered its age of decandence, with pirates, gangs and corporations fighting over the control of the market and the city neighborhoods. </p>
<p>The game's story is unfolded to the players through a career path quest story line, with tenths of side quests still available, pushing the players to pick sides over the corporate and gang wars taking place in the game.</p>
<h3>Dynamic events</h3>
<p>Urban Galaxy features ""Dynamic World Events"", events happening randomly within the game. Players are given the option to participate in these events (both PvP and PvE), by picking sides. The outcome of those events has an impact on the reputation of the players within the city syndicates, unlocking new quest storylines or triggering new dynamic events.</p>
<p><img alt=""Dynamic events"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.urbangalaxyonline.com/indiegogo/dynevent-dialog.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Dynamic events remove the ""static"" feeling of the classic MMOs, offering the game a live breathing city where random things can happen.</p>
<p>During the implementation of dynamic events, we tried to capture the gameplay model of popular first person shooters, tailoring it to the gameplay style of our game. For example, a player has the opportunity to take part on PvP/PvE events that emulate Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Control Points and Headquarters mini games. Winning or losing while playing those events, has an impact on the reputation against gangs or corporations and opens another path for collecting xp, credits or other goodies.</p>
<p><img alt=""Storyline circles, and their junction points"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.urbangalaxyonline.com/indiegogo/storyline-events.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Our goal is to extend the dynamic events system even more, where the outcome of those events affect even further the way the city behaves, such as altering the availability and pricing of goods in the shops, the value of items in the auction house and the territorial control from local authorities or city gangs (e.g. how police patrols are performed, number of mobs wandering in the neightborhoods etc).</p>
<h3>Game model</h3>
<p>The game is going to be a free-to-play MMO (F2P) and users will have unlimited access to all the available content. However, players who wish to shorten the time spent advancing their character, will be given a choice to purchase certain special items and boosts, available through the UG Store, following the microtransaction model.</p>
<h3>Develop in episodes</h3>
<p>UG is going to be an episodic MMO. While this campaign is running, we are heading towards the completion of the first episode of the game, with another four episodes to come, right after the game's launch. </p>
<p>We chose the episodic way of developing the game, because we would like users to shape up and decide how the next episodes are going to be. Revenues earned from each campaign are going to be invested into the development of the next episode, thus helping us get earlier in the market and making this effort self-sustainable.</p>
<h3>Supported platforms</h3>
<p>The game runs on all popular web browsers using Java. Windows, MacOSX and Linux are the supported operating systems.</p>
<h2>Development in progress</h2>
<p>Currently, UG is about 70% complete, with another 30% in the works while this campaign is running.</p>
<p><img alt=""Current WIP"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.urbangalaxyonline.com/indiegogo/dev-infographic.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""UG Episode01 Roadmap""/></p>
<p>We are working really hard to get the public beta of the 1st episode done on time, which is scheduled for the end of 2012 or beginning of 2013.</p>
<p>Our work in progress involves:</p>
<ul>

<li>Populate the city with lots of dynamic events and scenarios.</li>
<li>Introduce the first raid boss encounter of the game, the ""Pirate Mothership"".</li>

Hello to all! We are a small team, passionate about game development. About three years ago we had the idea about Urban Galaxy Online. After setting the basic outline of the game we started the development on our spare time.
Since then, the game has evolved and, we believe, matured to something bigger than a ""garage project"". With our passion as a driver we have made bold changes to the gameplay and tested it with some really helpful folks. You can check out the latest Urban Galaxy updates on our site at www.urbangalaxyonline.com. From there, you can access our forum, twitter and facebook pages.
So here we stand, on the final line to our first official release of Urban Galaxy Online, asking for your help in finalizing, tweaking and releasing our child to the public.
About Urban Galaxy Online
Urban Galaxy Online, or UG in short, is a 3D Massively Multiplayer Online Game, placed inside a futuristic megapolis called Anassin. The game runs within the web browser, requiring no client download. We tried to take advantage of this feature in order to include additional staff in the game's web page that users might find useful, such as  social features and walkthroughs that are accessible directly from the web while playing the game.

In UG you can find some good old mmorpg stuff like collecting xp points and upgrading your character through leveling, distributing skill points on class-specific skill trees, completing quest storylines, crafting new items using blueprints, parting with other players, upgrading your ship and gear by looting mobs or accesing city shops, selling stuff in the auction house etc.
In addition, the game features both PvE and PvP areas, daily quests and group fight against powerfull raid bosses.

The setting is somewhat futuristic retro, somewhat sci-fi. The player chooses among three classes: the Smuggler, the Mercenary or the Carrier, and navigates a vehicle of his/her choice around the city.

<p>Hello! <br/></p>
<p>My name is Wesley Elder and I am the new manager at The Game Exchange in Roxboro, N.C. I have been a gamer since I was 6 years old playing Super Mario 64 in Toys R' Us. However, I also grew up seeing The Game Exchange in my hometown.</p>
<p>The Game Exchange was hardly ever open growing up, but I decided recently to come in and turn it around. The gaming community in Roxboro has never had a place to call home for video games. We have always had to drive 45 minutes to an hour to get our games, much less a place to go play games together. That's what we're trying to do. We're trying to create not only an amazing store that sells games, but an amazing video game haven. <br/></p>
<p>We want to renovate the second floor of the building and turn it into a big video game tournament/chill area. The building feels old, looks old, and needs an update. It primarily has older games, which are awesome, but needs some newer games. I've been trying to clean, get new inventory, and renovate as much as 
possible with a $0 budget, but I have hit a wall. Since I started 
managing the store, there have been many other people who have 
volunteered as well to turn the store around. All of us are gamers who 
are passionate about creating a place that will bring gamers alike 
together.<br/></p>
<p>We want to thank you for reading our page and thank you so much for being a part of The Game Exchange. We hope that each and every one of you can visit us some day and play some games. (:<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/986088/files/20141104125204-The_Chores.jpg?1415134324"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<p>This is where we are asking you for help! We have a hefty goal ahead of us, but we know that it is possible if the gaming community unites. There are 3 main things that the building needs. The big three are heating, electrical work, and paint. None of these are cheap and all of them are necessary. However, everything is broken down in the pie chart below:</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/984059/files/20141103194652-20141104044605.jpg?1415072812"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>We can't do this without YOU! We hope you're just as excited as we are to become a part of The Game Exchange! </p>
<p></p>

<p>We have some fun perks and we want to be able to recognize every single person that helps us get there! You will always be immortalized on our wall in our store and then hopefully, one day, you will be able to come by and see it! We also want to play some games with you, so hopefully we make lots of friends!<br/></p>
<p>As I cleaned the store, I found some really cool and old video game memorabilia that are some of the perks. Check out the pics below to see what can be yours today!</p>

</div></div>","Hello! 
My name is Wesley Elder and I am the new manager at The Game Exchange in Roxboro, N.C. I have been a gamer since I was 6 years old playing Super Mario 64 in Toys R' Us. However, I also grew up seeing The Game Exchange in my hometown.
The Game Exchange was hardly ever open growing up, but I decided recently to come in and turn it around. The gaming community in Roxboro has never had a place to call home for video games. We have always had to drive 45 minutes to an hour to get our games, much less a place to go play games together. That's what we're trying to do. We're trying to create not only an amazing store that sells games, but an amazing video game haven. 
We want to renovate the second floor of the building and turn it into a big video game tournament/chill area. The building feels old, looks old, and needs an update. It primarily has older games, which are awesome, but needs some newer games. I've been trying to clean, get new inventory, and renovate as much as 
possible with a $0 budget, but I have hit a wall. Since I started 
managing the store, there have been many other people who have 
volunteered as well to turn the store around. All of us are gamers who 
are passionate about creating a place that will bring gamers alike 
together.
We want to thank you for reading our page and thank you so much for being a part of The Game Exchange. We hope that each and every one of you can visit us some day and play some games. (:



This is where we are asking you for help! We have a hefty goal ahead of us, but we know that it is possible if the gaming community unites. There are 3 main things that the building needs. The big three are heating, electrical work, and paint. None of these are cheap and all of them are necessary. However, everything is broken down in the pie chart below:


We can't do this without YOU! We hope you're just as excited as we are to become a part of The Game Exchange! 


We have some fun perks and we want to be able to recognize every single person that helps us get there! You will always be immortalized on our wall in our store and then hopefully, one day, you will be able to come by and see it! We also want to play some games with you, so hopefully we make lots of friends!
As I cleaned the store, I found some really cool and old video game memorabilia that are some of the perks. Check out the pics below to see what can be yours today!









And there are many more items that are unearthed every week! We might even put some new perks up. (:If we reach our goal, you can see clearly where it will all go. However, we do have a stretch goal! There is a 3rd floor and a basement area that I would love to turn into storage, but they need a lot of work as well. The 3rd floor is exposed to outside and the basement is a dirt floor.

<p>We are pleased to invite you into the new and vividly fantastical game series: <b>“The Guarding of Eden.”</b>  <br/></p>
<h3>PROJECT EDEN “ENTER EDEN”</h3>
<p>“The Guarding of Eden” is a MASSIVE Adventure story that can only be told through a MASSIVE game series.  That’s why we’re splitting it into two games.  “The Guarding of Eden: A Dragon’s Dream” and “The Guarding of Eden: Escape to Eden.”  Both games are designed to encourage players to learn about themselves through the choices they make.  Just as Frodo’s journey across Middle Earth in “<i>The Lord of the Rings</i>” changed him forever, “The Guarding of Eden” seeks to give players the chance to explore and interact with a story that touches on some of life’s biggest questions by providing fun and engaging ways of interacting with a Paradise in ruin.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/lIOZxhjIWnJjt22QcdQ0mjI-po9sD4I12kACEIZPloB0Ez_m8beQM7YRQvsLGY3mtFeVa4i8SslOnRTFp_9m7GLqytD3w6tPCaIQ2s4gV3VIucX1Xrq5qEsEc7Su8-D4BUamw0o"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We came to IndieGoGo so we can have <b>YOU</b> as companions along for this amazing journey.  Whoever you are and wherever you’re from, we invite you to become a Guardian of Eden!  Not only will your involvement make it possible for us to create and realize the dream to bring Eden to you, exactly as we envision it, it also allows us to form a worldwide community where we can collaborate in shaping Eden’s world and design.  We want your help!  So come along and join us in this mission to create something incredible together!</p>

“Even the smallest person can change the course of history.”– Tolkien in The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.</blockquote>
<br/><h2><b>THE STORY: “A Paradise in Ruin”</b></h2>
<p>Have you ever dreamed about saving the world? How about outright destroying it? In ""The Guarding of Eden"" you can choose between both!  Play as Slash Talon, the cocky dragon prince, who must venture outside the castle walls that bind him -and ultimately himself- in a world overflowing with beauty, danger, and adventure as he seeks his true purpose in life.  Explore a vast land of literary dreamscapes, encounter awesome animal rivals to obtain their unique abilities to aid you on your quest, and vanquish the Seven Deadly Sinister Villains who rule over this paradise in ruin- all the while deciding to either make the sacrifice to use your abilities to be a true Protector of Eden, or give in to the sheer fury of power and become Eden’s biggest Predator!  Gameplay will be fast and fun, simple to pick up but rewarding of finesse. Are you ready to enter Eden?</p>
<br/><h3>A Word from the creator, Peter Venoit Jr.</h3>
<p>This story has long been compelling me to tell it through games as it slowly took shape and developed around the experiences in my own life.  I envisioned a paradise inhabited by only talking animals (Redwall anyone?) that was created to operate in perfect harmony, but over the course of history selfishness crept in and the land began to sink into turmoil and ruin.  </p>
<p>Fast forward a couple dozen centuries and I imagined what it would be like to want to explore this land, but have to fight against the darkness that had sunk its roots deep.  By which time, a systemic evil would have entwined itself with the innate good and unique diversity of these various animal societies with the goal of complete dominance, resulting in a confused nature.  </p>
<p>How would one approach this kind of subtle evil?  I would imagine it would take the most pristine of virtues: Courage, Faith, Persistence, Humility, Discipline and the like.  I would imagine it would require a hero, but what kind of a hero would emerge from such a broken paradise?  These are the types of questions that fascinate me and inspired me to explore them in a game that is the best parts of <i>Megaman X</i> and <i>A Link to the Past</i>, incorporated with the fast-paced accessibility that modern technology affords.  I truly hope you will enjoy this and I invite you to explore Eden with us in our first game: “The Guarding of Eden: A Dragon’s Dream.”</p>

<p>In this bite-sized adventure you are Slash Talon, a tiny-but extraordinarily-powerful dragon.  Slash begins his journey trapped in the iron fortress known as “The Dragon’s Keep,” run by his dad, where he is forced to fight an onslaught of fearsome foes.  Recently he has heard the call of the Author in his heart and though he only knows violence, he dreams each night about escaping to the wonderland of Eden just beyond the horizon.  Through his window he can only see a volcanic wasteland of iron and smog, his heart yearns to explore the grassy meadows and mysterious ruins that lay beyond! </p>

Before you can reach your freedom, you must battle your way through armies of killer robots, monsters, and mutants to realize Slash’s dream of escaping to the beauty beyond!</span></p>

<p>Like we said before, <b>""The Guarding of Eden""</b> is a MASSIVE Game/Story. The extent of sacrifice needed to fully tell this story will be talked about for years to come.  A US Army General, Creighton Abrams, once said: ""When eating an elephant take one bite at a time,"" </p>
<p>. . . Gulp!! </p>
<p>But seriously, armed with that nugget of wisdom, we plan to start out small.</p>
<ul><li><p>The release of  <b>""The Guarding of Eden: A Dragon's Dream"" </b>is a bite-sized chunk of whole <b>""The Guarding of Eden""</b> story and is planned for release as a downloadable game for PC as an introduction to the world of Eden.  <br/><b><i>Tentative release date Fall 2016.</i></b><br/></p></li></ul>
<ul><li><p>We will then build <b>""The Guarding of Eden: Escape to Eden""</b> off of the success of <b>“A Dragon's Dream.</b>”  With a bigger team and bigger budget, we plan to release the next chapter of Eden within the next 2 years.</p></li></ul>
<ul><li><p>In addition to contributions from YOU, our fellow Guardians, our strategy is to also generate funds by working around-the-clock to deliver top quality animation, interactive media, and graphic materials to help other clients reach their graphical needs.  </p></li></ul>
<br/><h1>WE CAN DO IT!!</h1>
<p>Ok . . . It’s no secret we are newbies to the gaming industry.  So instead of rushing into battle without a plan, we've enlisted the support and counsel of industry professionals to learn from their years of experience and life lessons so we can avoid the dangerous pitfalls of inexperience. <br/></p>
<p>To name a few, there’s <b>Joseph Spadaford</b> our background artist who worked at Big Idea Production, the folks who made <i>Veggie Tales</i> a subsidiary of Dreamworks.<br/><b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Dr. Kevin Crawford,</b><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""> an active Hollywood screenplay writer, and a whole lot of other support from many wise counselors!</span></p>
<p>With your help in achieving our initial goal of $11,500 we can take that first huge step in accomplishing this massive adventure, and be able to pay and supply our core Team with the resources necessary to build a <b>“A Dragon’s Dream.”</b></p>
<p>The higher stretch goals will help us to more fully realize the Complete Version of the game, and to begin pre-production on <b>“The Guarding of Eden: Escape to Eden.”</b></p>

VISION
We are pleased to invite you into the new and vividly fantastical game series: “The Guarding of Eden.”  
PROJECT EDEN “ENTER EDEN”
“The Guarding of Eden” is a MASSIVE Adventure story that can only be told through a MASSIVE game series.  That’s why we’re splitting it into two games.  “The Guarding of Eden: A Dragon’s Dream” and “The Guarding of Eden: Escape to Eden.”  Both games are designed to encourage players to learn about themselves through the choices they make.  Just as Frodo’s journey across Middle Earth in “The Lord of the Rings” changed him forever, “The Guarding of Eden” seeks to give players the chance to explore and interact with a story that touches on some of life’s biggest questions by providing fun and engaging ways of interacting with a Paradise in ruin.

We came to IndieGoGo so we can have YOU as companions along for this amazing journey.  Whoever you are and wherever you’re from, we invite you to become a Guardian of Eden!  Not only will your involvement make it possible for us to create and realize the dream to bring Eden to you, exactly as we envision it, it also allows us to form a worldwide community where we can collaborate in shaping Eden’s world and design.  We want your help!  So come along and join us in this mission to create something incredible together!



“Even the smallest person can change the course of history.”– Tolkien in The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.
THE STORY: “A Paradise in Ruin”
Have you ever dreamed about saving the world? How about outright destroying it? In ""The Guarding of Eden"" you can choose between both!  Play as Slash Talon, the cocky dragon prince, who must venture outside the castle walls that bind him -and ultimately himself- in a world overflowing with beauty, danger, and adventure as he seeks his true purpose in life.  Explore a vast land of literary dreamscapes, encounter awesome animal rivals to obtain their unique abilities to aid you on your quest, and vanquish the Seven Deadly Sinister Villains who rule over this paradise in ruin- all the while deciding to either make the sacrifice to use your abilities to be a true Protector of Eden, or give in to the sheer fury of power and become Eden’s biggest Predator!  Gameplay will be fast and fun, simple to pick up but rewarding of finesse. Are you ready to enter Eden?
A Word from the creator, Peter Venoit Jr.
This story has long been compelling me to tell it through games as it slowly took shape and developed around the experiences in my own life.  I envisioned a paradise inhabited by only talking animals (Redwall anyone?) that was created to operate in perfect harmony, but over the course of history selfishness crept in and the land began to sink into turmoil and ruin.  
Fast forward a couple dozen centuries and I imagined what it would be like to want to explore this land, but have to fight against the darkness that had sunk its roots deep.  By which time, a systemic evil would have entwined itself with the innate good and unique diversity of these various animal societies with the goal of complete dominance, resulting in a confused nature.  
How would one approach this kind of subtle evil?  I would imagine it would take the most pristine of virtues: Courage, Faith, Persistence, Humility, Discipline and the like.  I would imagine it would require a hero, but what kind of a hero would emerge from such a broken paradise?  These are the types of questions that fascinate me and inspired me to explore them in a game that is the best parts of Megaman X and A Link to the Past, incorporated with the fast-paced accessibility that modern technology affords.  I truly hope you will enjoy this and I invite you to explore Eden with us in our first game: “The Guarding of Eden: A Dragon’s Dream.”

In this bite-sized adventure you are Slash Talon, a tiny-but extraordinarily-powerful dragon.  Slash begins his journey trapped in the iron fortress known as “The Dragon’s Keep,” run by his dad, where he is forced to fight an onslaught of fearsome foes.  Recently he has heard the call of the Author in his heart and though he only knows violence, he dreams each night about escaping to the wonderland of Eden just beyond the horizon.  Through his window he can only see a volcanic wasteland of iron and smog, his heart yearns to explore the grassy meadows and mysterious ruins that lay beyond! 
ARE YOU READY TO BREAK FREE?

Burn, Slice, and Slide your way through this real-time action RPG, minus the aimless wandering and errand running.  Though restricted, your mission is simple: Use your reflexes to outmaneuver and defeat waves enemies, build up the courage, and use your wits to liberate yourself from the Dragon’s Keep once and for all! Before you can reach your freedom, you must battle your way through armies of killer robots, monsters, and mutants to realize Slash’s dream of escaping to the beauty beyond!

Like we said before, ""The Guarding of Eden"" is a MASSIVE Game/Story. The extent of sacrifice needed to fully tell this story will be talked about for years to come.  A US Army General, Creighton Abrams, once said: ""When eating an elephant take one bite at a time,"" 
. . . Gulp!! 
But seriously, armed with that nugget of wisdom, we plan to start out small.
The release of  ""The Guarding of Eden: A Dragon's Dream"" is a bite-sized chunk of whole ""The Guarding of Eden"" story and is planned for release as a downloadable game for PC as an introduction to the world of Eden.  Tentative release date Fall 2016.
We will then build ""The Guarding of Eden: Escape to Eden"" off of the success of “A Dragon's Dream.”  With a bigger team and bigger budget, we plan to release the next chapter of Eden within the next 2 years.
In addition to contributions from YOU, our fellow Guardians, our strategy is to also generate funds by working around-the-clock to deliver top quality animation, interactive media, and graphic materials to help other clients reach their graphical needs.  
WE CAN DO IT!!
Ok . . . It’s no secret we are newbies to the gaming industry.  So instead of rushing into battle without a plan, we've enlisted the support and counsel of industry professionals to learn from their years of experience and life lessons so we can avoid the dangerous pitfalls of inexperience. 
To name a few, there’s Joseph Spadaford our background artist who worked at Big Idea Production, the folks who made Veggie Tales a subsidiary of Dreamworks.Dr. Kevin Crawford, an active Hollywood screenplay writer, and a whole lot of other support from many wise counselors!
With your help in achieving our initial goal of $11,500 we can take that first huge step in accomplishing this massive adventure, and be able to pay and supply our core Team with the resources necessary to build a “A Dragon’s Dream.”
The higher stretch goals will help us to more fully realize the Complete Version of the game, and to begin pre-production on “The Guarding of Eden: Escape to Eden.”

<h3>Skills</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1388641/files/20150416092645-igg_skills_final_620x310.png?1429201605"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>The path of each character is unique. There is no such thing like a class or profession, player is not limited in progress and almost every combination of skills is accessible.</strong> Player doesn't have level — skills progress during use of them. The important part of this system is that skills don’t limit player’s actions but conversely improve them. The high skill is required for very high-leveled actions only, other types of actions can be performed without high skills but their performance will be poor.</p>
<p>Skills are all connected and form a skill tree — from the more general to more specialized ones. More common skills affect all lower ones and all kinds of activity but they are more difficult to improve.</p>
<p>There are four root groups of skills: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Character skills</strong> affect characteristics and abilities of the character and are separated from the others. Skills like this have special ways of development.</li>
<li>
<strong>Crafting skills</strong> affect players ability to work with materials and items: crafting and modifying items, repair and recycling. Also it includes variety of skills related to creating consumable items. Players with high-level crafting skills can participate in grandmasters rating, advertising their services in such a way.</li>
<li>
<strong>Usage skills</strong> affect the ability of using items, powers or modifications. In this branch you can find all fighting and spell skills.</li>
<li>
<strong>Researcher skills</strong> affect the chances of critical hit, ability to collect animal-related resources, healing of creatures (including players). Particularly, disease healing also included in this group. <em>Yes, there are diseases!</em>

<h3>Rich crafting</h3>

<p><strong>Opportunities for the item creation and modification are huge. Crafting system allows player to create a variety of unique items for every taste.</strong></p>
<p>System is based on drafts, which determines the item type. Each draft has slots for applying materials, every material has its own characteristics, look and enhancements options. Skills of working with specific type of item and material have a big impact on items characteristics. Equipment used for that is important as well.</p>
<p><strong>Enhancements</strong> are effects applied to the items. They can endue an item with various abilities or characteristics. Some enhancements may have more value than basic characteristics of the tool or weapon. Possibilities for applying enhancements are determined by the item materials almost always. Some materials don't have any important battle use other than to powerful enchantment placement.</p>

<h3>Land Domains</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1388649/files/20150416092825-igg_domains_final_620x310.png?1429201705"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Seamless, constantly changing and populated world needs a good solution for managing land rights. Currently we are using the old and obsolete region system, which must be replaced by a new land domain system.</p>
<p><strong>Domain</strong> is an area, rights to which are limited by a special magical structure at its center — the Domain Core. The size of this area can vary greatly — from small homes to large cities. The interface allows you to customize the size of ownership and permissions of each member. Also, it has slots for special items, determining the specific settings of domain. Maintenance of domain regularly consumes a small amount of ingame currency — this ensures that the domain belongs to the active player.</p>
<p>Major domains have a title, description, color and icon to display on the map of the world, which are also shown at the entrance of the domain. Every domain is a part of the political map of the world.</p>
<p>Cities need more fine tuning of citizen's permissions, all along of large amounts of different areas. The older region system is used for this purpose. All regions inside the domain are affiliated to it. It means that during the owner of the domain changing affiliated region rights also change their ownership.</p>
<p>Domains can be traded, auctioned, regenerated and even conquered in a fair fight. <a href=""https://greencubes.org/article/domain-system#t"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Read more</a> about domains and regions.</p>

<h3>Ore and Mineral System</h3>
<p>Almost every item which you can buy it the players shops was produced by using materials mined by players. Our ore and mineral system is interesting, expandable and contains no design problems that have been an issue in Minecraft.</p>
<p>The entire ground is filled with ore veins mixed with each other. In addition to ores, there are other things, necessary to make underground more interesting. During the processing of rocks you get two different types of material: waste rock and ores. Waste rock has no value except as a building material, and the ore can be processed to get minerals. From each type of ore you can obtain minerals of different tiers:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1393235/files/20150417172705-ore_system2.png?1429316825"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><sup><em>These are examples of minerals divided by tiers</em></sup></p>
<p>The quantity and quality of minerals depends on the equipment used for the extraction of minerals. The better the equipment, the greater the amount of material obtained by processing ores. The best equipment will also provide a small amount of higher-tier mineral.</p>
<br/>
<a name=""personal-space"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>
<h3>Personal Space</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1393237/files/20150417172719-PersonalSpace.png?1429316839"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>In the single populous world a patch of land may be too expensive for a rookie. <strong>That's why everybody has their own personal space.</strong> It is not a part of giant main world, player never pays for it and can never loose it. On the other hand, it can not be shown to the others. It is just a personal area, private warehouse and workshop, a small room, which is otherwise essential for a newbie. Experienced players can use it for storing their most expensive items.</p>
<p>Access to the personal space goes through special portals placed and supported by players. It is expensive to make that kind of portal so it is a nice aim for a group of players. However there are some portals constantly placed near the spawn point to give new players a chance for using the personal space.</p>
<br/>
<a name=""combat-system"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>
<h3>Non-target Combat System</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1393238/files/20150417172736-AttackSystem.png?1429316856"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>The combat system based on the different types of damage and attack.</strong> Various types of damage are differently absorbed by armor, types of attack are what differs a bow from a sword. Every type of weapon has its own type of attack and most of them has no target and attacks selected side or region.</p>
<p>Monsters and players have a complex system of determining the result of attacks which depends on the armor. It means that headshot damages only armor in the slot of the helmet and only this piece of armor absorbs damage. It is just an example for the physical attack, magic and other attack types may work differently. The system is easily expandable, so we can add variety of new types of attacks and protections against them such as damage inflicted on the area, blocking projectiles with shield, poison clouds, chain lightning and critical hits.</p>

<h3>Item Workshop</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1393239/files/20150417172753-workshop.png?1429316873"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Community of players will be able to create their own decorative items</strong>: clothes, finery, even hairstyles. There will be a lot of slots on the character for all kinds of things. Furthermore, many objects can have alternative decorative modification (styles). But that is not all. It is possible to create even visual effects for some items. And for adjusting color balance in decorative effects we have universal system of color modifiers.</p>
<p>We have already developed drag'n'drop support for FBX asset format, which is the industry standard right now. By the way, we were the first ones to implement and to commit it to opensource-engine <a href=""http://jmonkeyengine.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">JME3</a>, which we are using.</p>
<br/>
<a name=""economy"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>
<h3>Economy</h3>
<p>Almost all of the elements of the game are linked with the economy, it is the heart of the world. It is very important part for the game with rich crafting, so we are well thought out everything related to the economy. GreenCubes has an open market economy. There are no NPC traders, no fixed prices, and our currency doesn’t fall from every monster. Only players, their money and goods. Our in-game currency called «Greeny» (do not be confused with GC Coins — currency for project's shop).</p>
<p>Each player chooses their own path of progress, a combination of skills and crafts. You can sell and buy not only items and resources but even service can be bought and sold. Craft and combat system are constructed in such a way that the trade could never been stopped, so everything from raw materials to the most complex items is always has demand. Even the most common materials always have a price because they are needed in large quantities. Unnecessary items can be recycled to get some raw materials from which they are made.</p>
<p><a href=""https://greencubes.org/article/trading-tools#t"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Trading tools</a> are necessary to make this a reality.</p>

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p><strong>The magic in this world is not a medieval delusion but laws of physics.</strong> Effective study and use of these laws has led civilization to prosperity. This is not a classic fantasy with castles and knights, this is a world of opportunities and magical technologies. Little time has passed since the scientific discoveries and magical breakthrough, so in this world medieval castles and flying ships can stand next to modern factories and underground fortresses.</p>
<p>Storyline has not yet thought over in detail, and we determined only general concepts and visual style of the game. The story is not very important for the sandbox RPG like ours, so we are focused on thinking through the game mechanic,developing technical features and visual style.</p>
<br/>
<h3>What we will sell</h3>
<p><strong>GreenCubes — Free to Play.</strong> The game is free but we will be selling some in-game items, mostly for the decoration use.</p>
<h4>We plan to sell:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Decorative wearables.</li>
<li>Alternative styles of tools and weapons.</li>
<li>Decorative effects, modifiers and counters.</li>
<li>Other decorative stuff.</li>
<li>Items, which open secondary skills, which don't gives much advantage but offer gameplay diversity.</li>
<li>Some other items and skills that do not affect the balance of the game.</li>
<li>Services related to domains and land operations (i.e. terraforming).</li>
</ul>
<p>The items listed above will not necessarily be sold directly — for example, decorative cloths are made by normal in-game crafting with clothing skill but require some ingredients from GC shop. Besides that, any item that is available through purchase could be obtained by trading with players due to developed economy.</p>
<h4>We shall not sell:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Basic resources</li>
<li>High-level weapons and armor</li>
<li>Instantaneous skill maximizing</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<h3>Our Team</h3>
<p><strong>Our main team, working on project as a full-time job:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Anna ‘Rena4ka’ Dorogova — lead programmer, team leader.</li>
<li>Elina ‘Feyola’ Zhernova — game designer, project leader.</li>
<li>Sergey ‘MushroomKiller’ Tsvetkov — 2d-artist.</li>
<li>Maria ‘MushrO_om’ Tsvetkova — community manager, helpers/moderators manager.</li>
<li>Fluffy — 3d-artist, concept artist.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Our super-volunteers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Arseniy 'Kern0' Maximov —  web developer, who created the <a href=""http://help.greencubes.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Support system</a> for us.</li>
<li>Vitaliy 'Xitaly' Mikheev — our spellchecker, translator, moderator, and 2d-artist who created more than 250 block/terrain textures for our client.</li>
<li>Venus — translator and moderator.</li>
<li>Alexandra 'tort32' M. — client-side programmer on vacation.</li>
<li>Destr — enthusiastic programmer.</li>
<li>Kunik — Server-side programmer.</li>
</ul>
<p>We also have a group of volunteers working as in-game moderators and helpers, they are important part of the team too. At last, we have some loyal players ready to provide assistance in number of areas.</p>
<br/>
<h3>Spending Plan</h3>
<p>First of all, 12% of raised money  will go to the fees and taxes. 68% will be used for a salaries of people who work full-time on project. The remaining 20% will be used to cover the rental of servers and software we use and that are necessary to supporting game. We are working remotely, so we don't pay office rent.</p>
<p>Additional funds we can use to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extend our team, primarily by employing our volunteers on a full-time job, accelerating the development of the game and improving its quality in general.</li>
<li>Extend the period in which we can work in full force, adding more features and content without worrying too much about in-game content sales aka microtransactions.</li>
<li>More perks can be added if funding summ greatly exceeds requirements.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<h3>Work plan</h3>
<p><strong>Our general goal for the year — adding core functionality with a small amount of secondary content to the game, it's almost all the major game features.</strong> At the end of the year game will not be quite ready but will be fully playable. We can reach self-sufficiency with well-working core gameplay and basic additional content.</p>
<ol>
<li>Finish client version 1.0 — support for all current server functions.</li>
<li>Full international support.</li>
<li>New inventory, part 1: fractional amounts of materials, non-slot inventories, separation of materials and items.</li>
<li>New inventory, part 2: new slots on the character, active slots, types of damage, the new armor system.</li>
<li>The new resource system: ores, minerals, refineries and self-sustaining undergrounds.</li>
<li>New character model, armor and clothes. <em>Will be carried out by artists simultaneously with the steps 1-5.</em>
</li>
<li>Trading tools revision: trading hubs, small vending machines, direct exchange, currency exchange. <a href=""https://greencubes.org/article/trading-tools#t"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">There is an article about this feature</a>.</li>
<li>Skills: adding a technical and interface framework for a variety of skills, introducing and tuning of the first skills.</li>
<li>Full revision of the new combat system with support of skill, inventory and armor systems.</li>
<li>Aggressive monsters and FreePvP-world.</li>
<li>Workshop for decorative items.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is just a short list of general goals. We will also deal with small tasks that appear on the go, like additional features, overall improvements, bug fixes and community management. Do not forget that tasks will be divided between several people, so work can be done faster and in a different order.</p>
<p>We reserve the right not to follow this plan precisely or change it in the future in case we consider it incorrect, unreasoned or not beneficial to the project.</p>
<br/>
<h3>Our Current State</h3>
<p>Most of the described features are not done yet, so our current game reminds of our past as a Minecraft server, because we are not have gone very far from it in matters of gameplay. But we already have our own client and server! Even though they are completely written and drawn by us and does not contain someone else's content, we need to maintain compatibility with older versions — GreenCubes is a huge world full of live players. We do not just change the existing game, we change the world itself.</p>
<p>With funding, we will be able to implement all our plans and exciting features without worrying about what we should sell to people next month</p>
<p><strong>About the current appearance of the character</strong></p>
<p>The biggest and most noticeable flaw of game in current state is boxed character inherited from Minecraft. Our players drew and sold each other skins for years, so while we do not have a strong alternative to skins, we can not just remove this feature. We have plans about the workshop which will give players the ability to create clothing, and that would be an excellent alternative to skins. However, we need a large amount of time and effort to create a new look for character and armor. Until now, our artists have been busy creating our analogues of content from Minecraft and now we did it! So after receiving funding, our artists will take care of this immediately.</p>
<br/>
<h3>Risks</h3>
<p>MMORPG is always a large and complex project but game with a voxel world is even more difficult. Yes, this is a great project, even a description of all its features do not fit on the page of the campaign. But we have a stable and high-performance server and fully customizable client to start with. We are ready to add content of the game itself, rather than engage in invisible to the user technical development. We have many years of experience with voxel world and the issues that it generates. (And there are more issues than it seems at first glance!) In addition, we have an awesome community of moderators and helpers and other loyal and talented people willing to help.</p>
<p><strong>We fully realize what we need to do to make this game a reality.</strong> Each of us have years of experience in this field. This is our full-time job and we don't want to leave it! We have a plan and done a lot of game design, with a complex technical base already developed.</p>
<br/>
<a name=""project-history"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>
<h3>Project history</h3>
<p>GreenCubes project was founded in November 2010 as a Minecraft server for Russian-speaking audience. There were only two of us. In spring 2011 we started to develop our own server (GreenServer) for this game, because the original server could not handle a large number of players. In the summer of 2011 we moved to our GreenServer. Many of the features of Minecraft were not implemented and we decided to stop adjusting our server under official 
updates and go with our own way. We still used Minecraft as game client but we seriously modified it, as well as abandoned its official updates. Since November 2011 and until the summer of 2013, we added a lot of our own content. Since the summer of 2013 we were working on a new game design. Since the beginning of 2014 we have been devoting ourselves to a new client, and now it is already playable, have better graphics and a new craft system. We realized that we can transform our server into a full independent game. Currently we well-thought all you can think about before the start of an active development. Now we just do not have enough funds.</p>
<p>We developed a new client by selling decorative content in our old game, which is strongly modified Minecraft. But now, more than a year, we are fully dedicated to the development of a new game and have made great progress in the development of a new client for it. But the old game disregarded and no longer profitable. <strong>So now we can not make it without Your support!</strong></p>
<h4>GreenServer</h4>
<p>GreenServer is our server. It is a stable, proven technical basis, which is necessary for server of any game. GreenServer is a powerful basis for a fully variable (voxel) world, which is not common feature for a game server.This is our own server, written entirely by us, so we know it better than if we had used someone else's product.Which means that we can easily modify and add to it the gameplay functionality of the game!</p>
<p>GreenServer actively developed from April 2011 until the spring of 2012. Then it became our server, which worked in pair with our old client. After that, we started working on the game, client and community. You can find a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMjptriKtMs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">video on YouTube</a> showing early version of the server. Its main advantage was then the high performance compared to Minecraft server.</p>

Single World Created by People
The World of GreenCubes is fully changeable. It is not divided into locations or instances so you will never run into loading screen while traveling. One world for everyone, single server. It is voxel-based, quite similar to Minecraft but even better.
As you can find from our history, we have a big world as our great heritage. We never wiped it completely. It is filled with stories about existing and ancient cities, political games of great players, tricky trading frauds... This world's mysteries are endless. Due to continuous renovation and expansion, everyone has the opportunity to colonize it. Thanks to the features we plan to realize this world will get a second birth, its golden age is still ahead!
The world like this is a real challenge for developers, however we have experience of maintaining it for years. These features will help to solve main difficulties:

Complex land domain system


Personal space for everyone
Automated world-wide subway system (Already done!)


Tools for planning and designing new buildings (sort of singleplayer)
A lot of decorative blocks (Already done!)

Tools for selective cleaning and regeneration of land

Besides the main world there is a parallel one with free PvP. There you can find a special resource required for high-level crafting. In addition to the hordes blood-thirsty players, this world is aggressive by its own: earthquakes and destruction makes it impossible to live in.


Skills

The path of each character is unique. There is no such thing like a class or profession, player is not limited in progress and almost every combination of skills is accessible. Player doesn't have level — skills progress during use of them. The important part of this system is that skills don’t limit player’s actions but conversely improve them. The high skill is required for very high-leveled actions only, other types of actions can be performed without high skills but their performance will be poor.
Skills are all connected and form a skill tree — from the more general to more specialized ones. More common skills affect all lower ones and all kinds of activity but they are more difficult to improve.
There are four root groups of skills: 


Character skills affect characteristics and abilities of the character and are separated from the others. Skills like this have special ways of development.

Crafting skills affect players ability to work with materials and items: crafting and modifying items, repair and recycling. Also it includes variety of skills related to creating consumable items. Players with high-level crafting skills can participate in grandmasters rating, advertising their services in such a way.

Usage skills affect the ability of using items, powers or modifications. In this branch you can find all fighting and spell skills.

Researcher skills affect the chances of critical hit, ability to collect animal-related resources, healing of creatures (including players). Particularly, disease healing also included in this group. Yes, there are diseases!




Rich crafting

Opportunities for the item creation and modification are huge. Crafting system allows player to create a variety of unique items for every taste.
System is based on drafts, which determines the item type. Each draft has slots for applying materials, every material has its own characteristics, look and enhancements options. Skills of working with specific type of item and material have a big impact on items characteristics. Equipment used for that is important as well.
Enhancements are effects applied to the items. They can endue an item with various abilities or characteristics. Some enhancements may have more value than basic characteristics of the tool or weapon. Possibilities for applying enhancements are determined by the item materials almost always. Some materials don't have any important battle use other than to powerful enchantment placement.
Notice: currently in our in-dev client is a craft window, which do not have anything alike this craft system, it is a temporary replacement for an older craft.


Land Domains

Seamless, constantly changing and populated world needs a good solution for managing land rights. Currently we are using the old and obsolete region system, which must be replaced by a new land domain system.
Domain is an area, rights to which are limited by a special magical structure at its center — the Domain Core. The size of this area can vary greatly — from small homes to large cities. The interface allows you to customize the size of ownership and permissions of each member. Also, it has slots for special items, determining the specific settings of domain. Maintenance of domain regularly consumes a small amount of ingame currency — this ensures that the domain belongs to the active player.
Major domains have a title, description, color and icon to display on the map of the world, which are also shown at the entrance of the domain. Every domain is a part of the political map of the world.
Cities need more fine tuning of citizen's permissions, all along of large amounts of different areas. The older region system is used for this purpose. All regions inside the domain are affiliated to it. It means that during the owner of the domain changing affiliated region rights also change their ownership.
Domains can be traded, auctioned, regenerated and even conquered in a fair fight. Read more about domains and regions.
Domain system implies integration with organizations. Read more about them.


Ore and Mineral System
Almost every item which you can buy it the players shops was produced by using materials mined by players. Our ore and mineral system is interesting, expandable and contains no design problems that have been an issue in Minecraft.
The entire ground is filled with ore veins mixed with each other. In addition to ores, there are other things, necessary to make underground more interesting. During the processing of rocks you get two different types of material: waste rock and ores. Waste rock has no value except as a building material, and the ore can be processed to get minerals. From each type of ore you can obtain minerals of different tiers:

These are examples of minerals divided by tiers
The quantity and quality of minerals depends on the equipment used for the extraction of minerals. The better the equipment, the greater the amount of material obtained by processing ores. The best equipment will also provide a small amount of higher-tier mineral.


Personal Space

In the single populous world a patch of land may be too expensive for a rookie. That's why everybody has their own personal space. It is not a part of giant main world, player never pays for it and can never loose it. On the other hand, it can not be shown to the others. It is just a personal area, private warehouse and workshop, a small room, which is otherwise essential for a newbie. Experienced players can use it for storing their most expensive items.
Access to the personal space goes through special portals placed and supported by players. It is expensive to make that kind of portal so it is a nice aim for a group of players. However there are some portals constantly placed near the spawn point to give new players a chance for using the personal space.


Non-target Combat System

The combat system based on the different types of damage and attack. Various types of damage are differently absorbed by armor, types of attack are what differs a bow from a sword. Every type of weapon has its own type of attack and most of them has no target and attacks selected side or region.
Monsters and players have a complex system of determining the result of attacks which depends on the armor. It means that headshot damages only armor in the slot of the helmet and only this piece of armor absorbs damage. It is just an example for the physical attack, magic and other attack types may work differently. The system is easily expandable, so we can add variety of new types of attacks and protections against them such as damage inflicted on the area, blocking projectiles with shield, poison clouds, chain lightning and critical hits.


Item Workshop

Community of players will be able to create their own decorative items: clothes, finery, even hairstyles. There will be a lot of slots on the character for all kinds of things. Furthermore, many objects can have alternative decorative modification (styles). But that is not all. It is possible to create even visual effects for some items. And for adjusting color balance in decorative effects we have universal system of color modifiers.
We have already developed drag'n'drop support for FBX asset format, which is the industry standard right now. By the way, we were the first ones to implement and to commit it to opensource-engine JME3, which we are using.


Economy
Almost all of the elements of the game are linked with the economy, it is the heart of the world. It is very important part for the game with rich crafting, so we are well thought out everything related to the economy. GreenCubes has an open market economy. There are no NPC traders, no fixed prices, and our currency doesn’t fall from every monster. Only players, their money and goods. Our in-game currency called «Greeny» (do not be confused with GC Coins — currency for project's shop).
Each player chooses their own path of progress, a combination of skills and crafts. You can sell and buy not only items and resources but even service can be bought and sold. Craft and combat system are constructed in such a way that the trade could never been stopped, so everything from raw materials to the most complex items is always has demand. Even the most common materials always have a price because they are needed in large quantities. Unnecessary items can be recycled to get some raw materials from which they are made.
Trading tools are necessary to make this a reality.

Additional Articles
In addition to the main features presented above, we have several articles about significant parts of the game, quite important in our community. You can find these articles on our site.


Organizations — unite players under one flag, our version of the «guilds».

Domains — land management system.

Decorative blocks — a huge arsenal for creative people. (Already done!)


Trading tools — for a lively and growing economy.

Worldwide subway system — automatic transport network, built and supported by players. (Already done!)


Hostile creatures — enemies for players to use their weapons, skills, armor, to unite against.

Modding - flexible interface and textures modification.

Tools for planning new buildings — to allow constructions of truly amazing and epic buildings.

Books — stories that fill our world. You can become a writer, keep a journal or even start a publishing office. (Already done!)


Support system — a unified system for bug reports, protection removal requests, pardon and ban requests, land regeneration requests  and others, fully integrated with our infrastructure. (Already done!)



The Story
The magic in this world is not a medieval delusion but laws of physics. Effective study and use of these laws has led civilization to prosperity. This is not a classic fantasy with castles and knights, this is a world of opportunities and magical technologies. Little time has passed since the scientific discoveries and magical breakthrough, so in this world medieval castles and flying ships can stand next to modern factories and underground fortresses.
Storyline has not yet thought over in detail, and we determined only general concepts and visual style of the game. The story is not very important for the sandbox RPG like ours, so we are focused on thinking through the game mechanic,developing technical features and visual style.

What we will sell
GreenCubes — Free to Play. The game is free but we will be selling some in-game items, mostly for the decoration use.
We plan to sell:

Decorative wearables.
Alternative styles of tools and weapons.
Decorative effects, modifiers and counters.
Other decorative stuff.
Items, which open secondary skills, which don't gives much advantage but offer gameplay diversity.
Some other items and skills that do not affect the balance of the game.
Services related to domains and land operations (i.e. terraforming).

The items listed above will not necessarily be sold directly — for example, decorative cloths are made by normal in-game crafting with clothing skill but require some ingredients from GC shop. Besides that, any item that is available through purchase could be obtained by trading with players due to developed economy.
We shall not sell:

Basic resources
High-level weapons and armor
Instantaneous skill maximizing


Our Team
Our main team, working on project as a full-time job:

Anna ‘Rena4ka’ Dorogova — lead programmer, team leader.
Elina ‘Feyola’ Zhernova — game designer, project leader.
Sergey ‘MushroomKiller’ Tsvetkov — 2d-artist.
Maria ‘MushrO_om’ Tsvetkova — community manager, helpers/moderators manager.
Fluffy — 3d-artist, concept artist.

Our super-volunteers:

Arseniy 'Kern0' Maximov —  web developer, who created the Support system for us.
Vitaliy 'Xitaly' Mikheev — our spellchecker, translator, moderator, and 2d-artist who created more than 250 block/terrain textures for our client.
Venus — translator and moderator.
Alexandra 'tort32' M. — client-side programmer on vacation.
Destr — enthusiastic programmer.
Kunik — Server-side programmer.

We also have a group of volunteers working as in-game moderators and helpers, they are important part of the team too. At last, we have some loyal players ready to provide assistance in number of areas.

Spending Plan
First of all, 12% of raised money  will go to the fees and taxes. 68% will be used for a salaries of people who work full-time on project. The remaining 20% will be used to cover the rental of servers and software we use and that are necessary to supporting game. We are working remotely, so we don't pay office rent.
Additional funds we can use to:

Extend our team, primarily by employing our volunteers on a full-time job, accelerating the development of the game and improving its quality in general.
Extend the period in which we can work in full force, adding more features and content without worrying too much about in-game content sales aka microtransactions.
More perks can be added if funding summ greatly exceeds requirements.


Work plan
Our general goal for the year — adding core functionality with a small amount of secondary content to the game, it's almost all the major game features. At the end of the year game will not be quite ready but will be fully playable. We can reach self-sufficiency with well-working core gameplay and basic additional content.

Finish client version 1.0 — support for all current server functions.
Full international support.
New inventory, part 1: fractional amounts of materials, non-slot inventories, separation of materials and items.
New inventory, part 2: new slots on the character, active slots, types of damage, the new armor system.
The new resource system: ores, minerals, refineries and self-sustaining undergrounds.
New character model, armor and clothes. Will be carried out by artists simultaneously with the steps 1-5.

Trading tools revision: trading hubs, small vending machines, direct exchange, currency exchange. There is an article about this feature.
Skills: adding a technical and interface framework for a variety of skills, introducing and tuning of the first skills.
Full revision of the new combat system with support of skill, inventory and armor systems.
Aggressive monsters and FreePvP-world.
Workshop for decorative items.

It is just a short list of general goals. We will also deal with small tasks that appear on the go, like additional features, overall improvements, bug fixes and community management. Do not forget that tasks will be divided between several people, so work can be done faster and in a different order.
We reserve the right not to follow this plan precisely or change it in the future in case we consider it incorrect, unreasoned or not beneficial to the project.

Our Current State
Most of the described features are not done yet, so our current game reminds of our past as a Minecraft server, because we are not have gone very far from it in matters of gameplay. But we already have our own client and server! Even though they are completely written and drawn by us and does not contain someone else's content, we need to maintain compatibility with older versions — GreenCubes is a huge world full of live players. We do not just change the existing game, we change the world itself.
With funding, we will be able to implement all our plans and exciting features without worrying about what we should sell to people next month
About the current appearance of the character
The biggest and most noticeable flaw of game in current state is boxed character inherited from Minecraft. Our players drew and sold each other skins for years, so while we do not have a strong alternative to skins, we can not just remove this feature. We have plans about the workshop which will give players the ability to create clothing, and that would be an excellent alternative to skins. However, we need a large amount of time and effort to create a new look for character and armor. Until now, our artists have been busy creating our analogues of content from Minecraft and now we did it! So after receiving funding, our artists will take care of this immediately.

Risks
MMORPG is always a large and complex project but game with a voxel world is even more difficult. Yes, this is a great project, even a description of all its features do not fit on the page of the campaign. But we have a stable and high-performance server and fully customizable client to start with. We are ready to add content of the game itself, rather than engage in invisible to the user technical development. We have many years of experience with voxel world and the issues that it generates. (And there are more issues than it seems at first glance!) In addition, we have an awesome community of moderators and helpers and other loyal and talented people willing to help.
We fully realize what we need to do to make this game a reality. Each of us have years of experience in this field. This is our full-time job and we don't want to leave it! We have a plan and done a lot of game design, with a complex technical base already developed.


Project history
GreenCubes project was founded in November 2010 as a Minecraft server for Russian-speaking audience. There were only two of us. In spring 2011 we started to develop our own server (GreenServer) for this game, because the original server could not handle a large number of players. In the summer of 2011 we moved to our GreenServer. Many of the features of Minecraft were not implemented and we decided to stop adjusting our server under official 
updates and go with our own way. We still used Minecraft as game client but we seriously modified it, as well as abandoned its official updates. Since November 2011 and until the summer of 2013, we added a lot of our own content. Since the summer of 2013 we were working on a new game design. Since the beginning of 2014 we have been devoting ourselves to a new client, and now it is already playable, have better graphics and a new craft system. We realized that we can transform our server into a full independent game. Currently we well-thought all you can think about before the start of an active development. Now we just do not have enough funds.
We developed a new client by selling decorative content in our old game, which is strongly modified Minecraft. But now, more than a year, we are fully dedicated to the development of a new game and have made great progress in the development of a new client for it. But the old game disregarded and no longer profitable. So now we can not make it without Your support!
GreenServer
GreenServer is our server. It is a stable, proven technical basis, which is necessary for server of any game. GreenServer is a powerful basis for a fully variable (voxel) world, which is not common feature for a game server.This is our own server, written entirely by us, so we know it better than if we had used someone else's product.Which means that we can easily modify and add to it the gameplay functionality of the game!
GreenServer actively developed from April 2011 until the spring of 2012. Then it became our server, which worked in pair with our old client. After that, we started working on the game, client and community. You can find a video on YouTube showing early version of the server. Its main advantage was then the high performance compared to Minecraft server.

Welcome to our crowdfunding campaign for Exgenesis!
We strongly believe in this ambitious project but only with your help we can make it happen. And every bit counts, so even if you can’t contribute please share this campaign: tell your friends, parents, neighbours, dogs, cats and even your grandma...
Exgenesis is a point and click adventure game for PC (Windows) with a peculiar graphical style that blends true photos with computer graphics to create a dreamlike and mysterious atmosphere.
Set in a dystopian future the game will have the player explore the most intimate places of his personality, accompanying him on a journey to discover the secrets of existence.
Classic point and click gameplay.
We are big fans of the genre and the game will reflect that. You can expect puzzles to solve, items to collect and use, places to explore, dialogues… all that good stuff.All the choices presented are viable.The protagonist is the player himself; what’s right or wrong is up to him and the story will take shape accordingly. This leads to high replayability and multiple endings.
Mix of real world photos and computer graphics.

All the scenes in the game are artfully composed by photo editing from various sources. We blend together photos (including real historical landmarks and handcrafted clay models) and computer generated images to produce distinctive, eye-catching visuals. All of this presented in full HD resolution.Immersive surreal experience.
The peculiar graphical style, together with the story based on real ancient beliefs, creates an unique experience that sends the player on a strange journey full of mystery and discovery.
We can’t reveal all the details yet but here is a small introduction to the plot:
Everything we’ve been taught about the Creation is a lie. The true story of the genesis has been lost to the ages. Our ancestors failed to preserve the truth and the purpose of our existence has been forgotten.
Many years from the greatest war the world has ever seen, mankind has completely lost his spirituality and is now living only to fulfill his material needs. This isn’t acceptable anymore. A new beginning is needed. A new earth.They’re already watching us. They’re judging us. They’re already choosing who's worthy of watching the dawn of the new humankind, and those who will take part in it.The story behind Exgenesis is based on real legends and beliefs and it offers an original take on the genesis myth.
Everything takes place in a dystopian future where mysterious entities put the player to the test as he tries to uncover the true nature of the world.
There are various ways to help us achieve our goal of making a game you’ll love (or at least we hope so):



Back us through this campaign and receive EXCLUSIVE rewards.


Vote for us on Steam Greenlight.

Tell everybody you know about us and our game.
Follow us on our socials (links at the end of the page)






As most of you know developing a game requires lots of time and, as a consequence, money. For the past several months we have been working on Exgenesis relying only on our savings. Unfortunately they’re running out and if we want to continue working full time on the project we need new funds. That’s where you come in. If this campaign is successful we’ll be able to make our vision come true unhindered and bring you a finished and polished game.

<p>Welcome to RISE UP, the sport of Ultimate’s first professional instructional video series. If your goal is to become a better ultimate player or make your team better, you've come to the right place.</p>
<p><strong>The mission of RISE UP</strong> is to improve the level of play of Ultimate teams and players through the creation of engaging instructional videos created by experts. </p>
<p><strong>Our goal</strong> is to create useful teaching tools that empower players at any level to call a friend, grab a disc, and immediately improve their game. </p>
<h1>The Story</h1>
<p>RISE UP began with a story that many Ultimate players can relate to. It started in the heart and mind of an ultimate player who found himself addicted to a phenomenally intriguing sport community, and wanted to learn everything he could about how to play, but lacked the resources or connections to help himself get better. As someone who attended a school that lacked Ultimate tradition, I found myself, essentially, teaching myself how to play, learning by trial and error, and watching other great teams and players at tournaments in order to gain insight. Those incredible teams seemed to, not only be miles ahead of where I was, but also, because their schools had recognized, established Ultimate culture and programs (i.e. Wisconsin, Carleton, Paidea, Amherst), those players also seemed to be learning at a rate that was much quicker than me and my small-school teammates. I realized those programs had people (captains, coaches, alumni) who had played at the highest level of the sport, and were now passing on everything they knew, allowing players to skip the inefficiency of trial and error, moving quickly towards best practice. My team didn't have access to people like that. The deck seemed to be stacked against us. </p>
<p>This situation still exists for a majority of the players in the ultimate community. Enter, RISE UP.</p>
<p><strong>The Need for RISE UP</strong></p>
<p>The sport and community of Ultimate is growing and expanding at an incredible rate, an Ultimate renaissance is at hand. Thanks to incredible organizations like Skyd Magazine, Nexgen Network, and Ultivillage, Ultimate players and fans who have been starving for more of what they want are finally feeling like they have resources to quench their thirst.  With this growth in the spread of news, knowledge, and ideas, we think it makes sense that there should also be progress and growth in the way people learn how to PLAY Ultimate. We are proud and humbled to hope to create what will be an ultimate education revolution... RISE UP. </p>
<h1>The Product</h1>

</ul></div>","The Mission
Welcome to RISE UP, the sport of Ultimate’s first professional instructional video series. If your goal is to become a better ultimate player or make your team better, you've come to the right place.
The mission of RISE UP is to improve the level of play of Ultimate teams and players through the creation of engaging instructional videos created by experts. 
Our goal is to create useful teaching tools that empower players at any level to call a friend, grab a disc, and immediately improve their game. 
The Story
RISE UP began with a story that many Ultimate players can relate to. It started in the heart and mind of an ultimate player who found himself addicted to a phenomenally intriguing sport community, and wanted to learn everything he could about how to play, but lacked the resources or connections to help himself get better. As someone who attended a school that lacked Ultimate tradition, I found myself, essentially, teaching myself how to play, learning by trial and error, and watching other great teams and players at tournaments in order to gain insight. Those incredible teams seemed to, not only be miles ahead of where I was, but also, because their schools had recognized, established Ultimate culture and programs (i.e. Wisconsin, Carleton, Paidea, Amherst), those players also seemed to be learning at a rate that was much quicker than me and my small-school teammates. I realized those programs had people (captains, coaches, alumni) who had played at the highest level of the sport, and were now passing on everything they knew, allowing players to skip the inefficiency of trial and error, moving quickly towards best practice. My team didn't have access to people like that. The deck seemed to be stacked against us. 
This situation still exists for a majority of the players in the ultimate community. Enter, RISE UP.
The Need for RISE UP
The sport and community of Ultimate is growing and expanding at an incredible rate, an Ultimate renaissance is at hand. Thanks to incredible organizations like Skyd Magazine, Nexgen Network, and Ultivillage, Ultimate players and fans who have been starving for more of what they want are finally feeling like they have resources to quench their thirst.  With this growth in the spread of news, knowledge, and ideas, we think it makes sense that there should also be progress and growth in the way people learn how to PLAY Ultimate. We are proud and humbled to hope to create what will be an ultimate education revolution... RISE UP.

<h3>ABOUT REAL LIFE GAMES</h3>
<p>Do you eat, sleep and breathe video games?</p>
<p>Now you can live them.</p>
<p>Welcome to Real Life Games, where we take virtual games and make them reality.</p>
<p>Our founder, Nick Hobson, started this venture with the idea of combining the atmosphere of a Renaissance faire with the experience of a video game. From there, he enlisted Matt Swanson, Director of Marketing/PR, to flesh out the details. Soon, Real Life Games was created and we began our first game pitch.</p>
<p>At heart, we’re a group of people trying to do something fun with our friends. Our aim is to design a world where our customers can come together with their friends and experience their favorite video games firsthand.</p>
<p>We wanted to create a space where friends of different backgrounds can come together and enjoy the game. A place where nerdy friends, athletic friends and gamer friends can all unite to have a good time.</p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7aCR8YwZGiRNpiaA/giphy.gif"" src=""""/><p> </p>
<p>Our idea is simple: Take a virtual universe and create its real world counterpart.</p>
<p>Real Life Games is the first of its kind. Virtual reality’s goal is to put you into the game, our goal is to bring games to life. We’re bringing you an experience created by real gamers.</p>
<p>Our team has the talent of a three time Emmy Award winning set designer, David Weller; combined with the expertise of writers, makeup artists, actors and stunt crews. This is truly a company of passionate creative individuals ready to put the work in and create something unforgettable.</p>
<p>We work together to bring our games into existence. It’s time to get up and play for real!</p>
<p> </p>

<p><strong>Step one, the idea.</strong> First things first, we get together with a big empty white board and begin brainstorming. Ideas get thrown out left and right until our board is filled, or we get tired of insulting one another. We then begin the process of elimination until we are left with an idea the whole team can feel excited about.<br/><br/><strong>Step two, the concept. </strong>After the idea is selected, we split up and do what we do best, artists begin drawing visual concept art, while marketing and sales team starts strategizing. Of course, everyone is super excited and much of our time is spent spying over the artist’s shoulder to see what things look like, but hey, can you blame us?</p> <p><strong>Step three, the pitch.</strong> When we have our art, sales and marketing planned, we put the pitch together. We head to the races hoping our client loves the idea as much as we do.<br/><br/><strong>Step four, design.</strong> The groundwork has been laid, now we need to knuckle down and iron out the details. We work on scale first, making sure we have our proportions down, building models of each game until we love what we have. After the models are outlined, we pick the materials for each wall and prop to create the most realistic experience possible.<br/><br/><strong>Step five, build.</strong> Construction begins, our sales and marketing teams are hyping up the game, posting updates and sharing our progress with you guys, the players. This way you can keep track of everything that’s happening start to finish.<br/><br/><strong>Step six, beta.</strong> Donators on our closed beta invite list will be notified of our new game release. The set will be constructed and beta play will commence. Initial play allows us to find design flaws, safety issues or any inconsistencies with our projects. Simultaneously, we will record and share the beta footage to really get people pumped!</p> <p><strong>Step seven, play.</strong> The moment you’ve all been waiting for! We tear down, pack up and ship out. Our crew arrives at our events early and sets up an unforgettable experience for everyone involved.</p>

<h2>HOW WE MAKE OUR MONEY</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Real Life Games is currently a business facing company. Our goal is to work with, or for other businesses. We enhance the customer experience at conventions, create new corporate team building activities and develop amazing PR stunts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Each project will be sold differently. Some projects will be pre-sold to advertisers, while others will bring in revenue from ticket sales. We might be a business facing company, but we always have the consumer in mind.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We want to make all of our experiences readily available for you, the players. The more backers we get, the more appealing our company becomes to events and advertisers. That means more events close to you!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>CUSTOM AND LICENSED BUILDS</h2>
<p>For full scale replication we carefully investigate each of the game’s areas creating Auto CAD overlays and measuring scale to get the most accurate representation. As our designs evolve, we send the plans back and forth to our clients and the game creators for approval before moving on. We keep a constant open flow of communication to make sure we produce something everyone can be excited about.</p> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504215942/utmyma1usbtoiy3wyrxt.jpg"" src=""""/><p> </p>
<p>16,000 square feet. You read that right, that is the size of our largest design to date. We can’t tell you what it is since this project is still underway, but our pictures can give you a hint or two. We carefully deconstructed this game and meticulously designed the field from an incredibly popular competitive play map.</p>

With a daughter to take care of and a job to do, he simply didn’t have the resources to finish his creation any longer. It is our absolute pleasure to take on his ideas and create a live Flagship Game.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504216889/d25j8fhaaueiskicfkpk.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Above is one of the actual hand drawn mazes done by Paul in the early days of his plans.

<p>Sometimes the constraints of square footage hit us hard but that doesn’t mean we can’t host an amazing event with awesome content! Our Real Life Mini Games are designed for just those situations, created to fit within 1000 sq. ft. of space, these games will be able to squeeze into most convention hall meeting rooms. We can design new, customized and personalized mini   games for any event.</p>

<h2>BIG IDEA</h2>
<p>Our ultimate goal is to have fully immersive games available for play in multiple locations at any time.</p>
<p>The first game we have in mind takes place in a space station. Using RFID tagging equipment and HUD overlays to display health, player level, ammunition and mission tracking you may just forget you’re in a game.</p>

PLAYING GAMES HAS
NEVER BEEN SO REAL
 
ABOUT REAL LIFE GAMES
Do you eat, sleep and breathe video games?
Now you can live them.
Welcome to Real Life Games, where we take virtual games and make them reality.
Our founder, Nick Hobson, started this venture with the idea of combining the atmosphere of a Renaissance faire with the experience of a video game. From there, he enlisted Matt Swanson, Director of Marketing/PR, to flesh out the details. Soon, Real Life Games was created and we began our first game pitch.
At heart, we’re a group of people trying to do something fun with our friends. Our aim is to design a world where our customers can come together with their friends and experience their favorite video games firsthand.
We wanted to create a space where friends of different backgrounds can come together and enjoy the game. A place where nerdy friends, athletic friends and gamer friends can all unite to have a good time.
 
Our idea is simple: Take a virtual universe and create its real world counterpart.
Real Life Games is the first of its kind. Virtual reality’s goal is to put you into the game, our goal is to bring games to life. We’re bringing you an experience created by real gamers.
Our team has the talent of a three time Emmy Award winning set designer, David Weller; combined with the expertise of writers, makeup artists, actors and stunt crews. This is truly a company of passionate creative individuals ready to put the work in and create something unforgettable.
We work together to bring our games into existence. It’s time to get up and play for real!
 
PERKS AND LOOT
retain all of your loot as you level up! Each level contains it's own loot including all of the prizes previous to it.
 
WHAT WE DO

Step one, the idea. First things first, we get together with a big empty white board and begin brainstorming. Ideas get thrown out left and right until our board is filled, or we get tired of insulting one another. We then begin the process of elimination until we are left with an idea the whole team can feel excited about.Step two, the concept. After the idea is selected, we split up and do what we do best, artists begin drawing visual concept art, while marketing and sales team starts strategizing. Of course, everyone is super excited and much of our time is spent spying over the artist’s shoulder to see what things look like, but hey, can you blame us? Step three, the pitch. When we have our art, sales and marketing planned, we put the pitch together. We head to the races hoping our client loves the idea as much as we do.Step four, design. The groundwork has been laid, now we need to knuckle down and iron out the details. We work on scale first, making sure we have our proportions down, building models of each game until we love what we have. After the models are outlined, we pick the materials for each wall and prop to create the most realistic experience possible.Step five, build. Construction begins, our sales and marketing teams are hyping up the game, posting updates and sharing our progress with you guys, the players. This way you can keep track of everything that’s happening start to finish.Step six, beta. Donators on our closed beta invite list will be notified of our new game release. The set will be constructed and beta play will commence. Initial play allows us to find design flaws, safety issues or any inconsistencies with our projects. Simultaneously, we will record and share the beta footage to really get people pumped! Step seven, play. The moment you’ve all been waiting for! We tear down, pack up and ship out. Our crew arrives at our events early and sets up an unforgettable experience for everyone involved.

 
HOW WE MAKE OUR MONEY
 
Real Life Games is currently a business facing company. Our goal is to work with, or for other businesses. We enhance the customer experience at conventions, create new corporate team building activities and develop amazing PR stunts.
 
Each project will be sold differently. Some projects will be pre-sold to advertisers, while others will bring in revenue from ticket sales. We might be a business facing company, but we always have the consumer in mind.
 
We want to make all of our experiences readily available for you, the players. The more backers we get, the more appealing our company becomes to events and advertisers. That means more events close to you!
 
CUSTOM AND LICENSED BUILDS
For full scale replication we carefully investigate each of the game’s areas creating Auto CAD overlays and measuring scale to get the most accurate representation. As our designs evolve, we send the plans back and forth to our clients and the game creators for approval before moving on. We keep a constant open flow of communication to make sure we produce something everyone can be excited about.  
16,000 square feet. You read that right, that is the size of our largest design to date. We can’t tell you what it is since this project is still underway, but our pictures can give you a hint or two. We carefully deconstructed this game and meticulously designed the field from an incredibly popular competitive play map.
 
 Originally created by Paul Hobson, Open Door Save Princess ran into a stalemate when life got the better of our CEO’s younger brother. With a daughter to take care of and a job to do, he simply didn’t have the resources to finish his creation any longer. It is our absolute pleasure to take on his ideas and create a live Flagship Game.

""Homage to the Thales of Miletus, this maze explores the peculiar theory of unified physics that holds the belief that EVERYTHING IS WATER; This theory later becoming outwitted by the atomic theory that EVERYTHING IS MOST DECIDEDLY NOT WATER, BUT STILL UNFAVORABLY IS INCONSISTENT, and was later utterly destroyed by the invention of the umbrella, keeping people relatively water-free since 1852.""
Above is one of the actual hand drawn mazes done by Paul in the early days of his plans. Each maze, although following a continual story, has it’s own witty theme and series of challenges to complete. Adventure through the winding hallways and solve challenging puzzles with your friends as this epic story unfolds maze after maze. 
Sometimes the constraints of square footage hit us hard but that doesn’t mean we can’t host an amazing event with awesome content! Our Real Life Mini Games are designed for just those situations, created to fit within 1000 sq. ft. of space, these games will be able to squeeze into most convention hall meeting rooms. We can design new, customized and personalized mini   games for any event.
  
BIG IDEA
Our ultimate goal is to have fully immersive games available for play in multiple locations at any time.
The first game we have in mind takes place in a space station. Using RFID tagging equipment and HUD overlays to display health, player level, ammunition and mission tracking you may just forget you’re in a game.
The station will be built as a massive movie set and employees will be full time characters in the game. Our team of actors and various stunt personnel will play as the villains taking over parts of the station and requiring players to retake sections one at a time.

The entire game will run back end on a server tracking statistics, analytics and story updates just like a video game. Your missions will be received via Bluetooth earpiece from our base command operative, walking you through each objective as you play.
Gather friends and play as tanks, healers or damage dealers in order to protect the earth from invasion!
This idea is an enormous undertaking for the future and we need your help to accomplish it. Donate, share our info with your friends, follow our social media, if you believe in this as much as we do then let’s come together to make this a reality.
 

RISKS AND CHALLENGES
The journey of establishing a start up is creative and exciting, but it can also come with many hurdles. In order to execute a project, we first need to complete the design and build the construction phases. One of our major hindrances is the time between planning and constructing the games. Our process requires both the time to design and construct each game before they are playable.  For a small business like us, those gaps in revenue can be constraining.
Real Life Games needs funds to properly build, execute and explore all possible recreations of your favorite games. We are requesting your help with raising the capital necessary to see our projects to fruition. With your sponsorship, we can make this a reality and truly bring games to life. Don't let it be game over for this great idea.

The game is basically a real time Role Playing Game (<b>RPG</b>) game but has many strategic elements and its world is dynamic, it is continuously developing with the passage of time. Furthermore you can decide who you want to be and live as an<b> Indigenous</b> or a <b>settler</b>, you can develop and protect your own village, or if you are more ambitious you can attack and conquer other villages and towns. <br/>
In Novus Mundus certain possible scenarios are outlined (e.g. technical and historical developments) but at the end of the day it <b>depends on the players</b> where the world of Novus Mundus is going static. </p><p><br/><br/><b>Some key features in the game:</b><br/><br/></p><ul>
<li>Fully realistic environment: <b>vulnerable objects</b> (e.g. buildings can be destroyed and built either), <b>drainable resources</b> (mines, forests, animals), <b>dynamic terrain</b> that affects visibility, speed, moral and health.<br/>
</li>
<li>Complex society: if you are a leader <b>your decisions affects other players and vice versa </b>the players activities affects the leaders position.<br/>
</li>
<li>The game is continuously changing: <b>periods</b> with full of action and peaceful times are varying during the game according to players’ behaviour. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/562849/files/20140507030851-ELVALASZTO_The_World_of_Novus_Mundus.jpg?1399457331"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""/>
</li>
</ul>Novus Mundus is an open world and has its own declared history which is partly overlapped by our world’s history. In the beginning only one ethnic group is known, that is the <b>Native Americans</b>. <br/>
A few remarkable events are highlighted in Novus Mundus’s history. These <b>events</b> can be discovered one by one by the players (e.g. treasure of the Knights Templar, red haired native american tribe, El Dorado, <b>Inca Gold</b>, <b>The Fountain of Youth</b>, Nazca Lines, <b>mystery of Machu Picchu</b>, etc.). <br/><br/>
In the beginning of the game a few villages and cities of the Aztec, of the Inca and the Maya Empires exist, but these tribes are far away from the starting points.<br/>One of the key features of Novus Mundus is that it is a fully <b>open world </b>(with <b>sandbox</b> elements)<b> </b>without restrictions. You can go wherever and do whatever you want.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/562871/files/20140507031855-02nm_INDIAN_copy.jpg?1399457935"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/562896/files/20140507033935-ELVALASZTO_Characters.jpg?1399459175"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""/><br/></p>Each character has a detailed description of their abilities and attributes, which are the following: health, ethics, energy, level of character, experience, battle experience, profession and level of profession, speed, hunger, skills (e.g. sneaking), tribe or settlement rank, etc.. <br/><br/>
Every character has a base camp where they live and where they are reborn in case of death. In the beginning the <b>players</b> can choose their <b>names</b>, which tribe they would like to belong to and <b>generate a look</b> (head, face painting, hair, etc.) but there will be an option for players to upload their own photos and ones that are made by a graphic designer of Novus Mundus. <br/><br/>
The players can also choose from the following <b>professions</b>: fisherman, hunter, chef, shaman, gunsmith, craftsman, forester, ostler, thief, hit man, spy, sharpshooter, etc.<br/><br/>
Finally, the players can set whether they would like to be a beginner or an advanced player. This setting <b>affects their birthplace</b>.<br/><br/>
If they choose beginner level, the players will be born in a camp where they will be guided through the basics of the game. If they choose to be born as an advanced player, they will be born in a higher level camp where they immediately become a fully contributing resident of the camp. From there begins the game!<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/562851/files/20140507030946-ELVALASZTO_The_game___the_beginnings.jpg?1399457386"" src="""" style=""""/></p>A newborn player has a loin-cloth, a minimum set of tools (depending on the chosen profession) and a minimum amount of shells. Shells function as money between Native Americans in the first phase of the game, later when the pioneers arrive, this will change. <br/>
All characters must eat and have rest (these can be modified and extruded by infusion of herbs, totems or shaman magic).<br/><br/>
Practically, a player can do anything with his character that is why Novus Mundus called a totally free and realistic world. But first it is suggested that characters <b>work</b> something<b> to earn</b> shells, or <b>prepare</b> something that can be <b>sold</b>. Work can be anything based on the chosen profession, e.g. hunting, fishing, etc. <br/>
By the time the players earn enough shells to buy weapons and any other stuff, they can start the adventures and develop their characters!<br/><br/><center>Basically, the Indians life is either about battles and honour or about peaceful living in harmony. In Novus Mundus you have the opportunity for both,<br/>it’s up to you! <br/>
</center>
<br/>
In the game you can build your own camp, <b>fulfill executive positions</b> (e.g. chieftain, second in command, shaman, soul rider, first hunter, leader of women, shaman mate, scout, grey haired wise chieftain, best warrior title, etc.), start wars, discover new areas or maintain peaceful <b>diplomatic relationships</b> (e.g. commercial agreements).<br/><br/>
The game is fully realistic, so every object in Novus Mundus depreciates with time, even animals gets older slowly. The characters move, fight,<b> act in real time, </b>which gives the opportunity to use<b> tactical elements</b>, e.g. an observer can be sent to the hill to view further whilst the others are hiding at the bottom of the hill ready to attack. Speed of moving and visibility is realistic, too. Character speed can be developed and increased with magic during the game. Visibility is reduced when you are moving in a forest (you cannot see other parts of the map) and also dynamic elements of the game can have other effects (Fog Of War).<br/><br/><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/563370/files/20140507075231-Novus_Mundus_shaman_wallpaper.jpg?1399474351"" src="""" style=""width: 580.6868327402135px; height: 327px;""/></p><br/><p></p><p></p>One of the <b>unique features</b> of Novus Mundus is non-player character<b> (NPC) soldiers</b>.

Here you can see the outline of the scenarios of Novus Mundus:<br/><br/><b>
1. Life or death scenario – Era of the Native Americans: </b><br/>
In the first period of Novus Mundus, Indigenous rule the world, you can act like them, work, fund a new camp, become a chieftain, make war, take part in adventures, etc.<br/><br/><b>
2. City management and adventures scenario – Arrival of the Settlers (pioneers): </b><br/>
In the second period of the game, suddenly the settlers arrive from the Old World. A few characters of the game will change their roles and find themselves on the boats of the settlers. Then they arrive in the New World and start to discover and colonize it. This event will be a surprise for Native Americans, the date of the arrival will not be revealed to them. In the beginning the settlers will have only very little amount of everything so they have to act as friends of the natives, but after a while conflicts will appear and wars can begin or not. It depends on the habits and actions of the players! (e.g. during the test games the inhabitants of a Portugal village were chased back to the sea and their main city was destroyed by natives).<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/568637/files/20140509112256-part_3_4.jpg?1399659776"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><b>
3. Captain scenario – Appearance of the Pirates:</b><br/>
Owning a ship will widen the opportunities of the players enormously. From this point, of the game ships will be high-lighted elements of Novus Mundus. As a consequence, a new life style and group will appear, they are the pirates. Playing as a pirate will be optional for every player.<br/><br/><b>
4. Strategic scenario – Formation of Regular forces and War of Independence:</b> <br/>
As a result of development, the first capital will be formed from where the regular forces can be controlled and the first fortresses appear. The characters can join the army (or navy), and become an officer. The taxes levied by the old country are getting stifling so the War of Independence is about to happen and new ethnical groups appear from Asia and Africa.<br/><br/><b>
5. Forts and duels scenario – Wild West:</b><br/>
Culmination of the game will be the era of the Wild West. At this time serious and bloody battles can happen between fortresses and regular forces. Due to new technologies (e.g. Colt) a possible scenario is the decline of Native Americans.<br/><br/>One of the key features of the game is that you can shape the history of the world of Novus Mundus. Your decisions’ impacts are not limited to the life of your character, if you are in an executive position (e.g. chieftain, shaman, viceroy, governor,<b> mayor</b>, general, <b>pirate</b>, admiral,<b> </b> <b>seriff</b>, etc.) you can change the course of history.<br/><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/562899/files/20140507034025-ELVALASZTO_perks.jpg?1399459225"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/562887/files/20140507033232-02BRONZ_Rewards.jpg?1399458752"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/562888/files/20140507033249-02EZUST_Rewards.jpg?1399458769"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/562889/files/20140507033311-02ARANY_Rewards.jpg?1399458791"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/562856/files/20140507031140-ELVALASZTO_Why_do_I_need_your_help.jpg?1399457500"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>A basic version of Novus Mundus has been<b> successfully tested in a closed small group</b>.

I regret to announce that today we close down the
crowdfunding campaign of Novus Mundus. The campaign have not been collected
enough funds yet so there is no sense continuing it. In the next days we will
start the negotiations with our backers about refunding. Due to technical
issues the campaign will be still live for 11 more days, but we do not accept
funds anymore.
Once again I would like to say thank you for all of
our backers and supporters, we really appreciate your support!
Best Regards
Attila26.05.2014. update:Hello Everyone!A few of you asked if we could show you a graphic about the final version of the game. Well we worked hard all last week to show you the final graphics and interface of the game! We hope you’ll like it! :-)Novus Mundus - Conquest of the New World is a Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (MMORPG) set in the era from the colonization till the Wild West. 
The game is basically a real time Role Playing Game (RPG) game but has many strategic elements and its world is dynamic, it is continuously developing with the passage of time. Furthermore you can decide who you want to be and live as an Indigenous or a settler, you can develop and protect your own village, or if you are more ambitious you can attack and conquer other villages and towns. 
In Novus Mundus certain possible scenarios are outlined (e.g. technical and historical developments) but at the end of the day it depends on the players where the world of Novus Mundus is going static. Some key features in the game:
Fully realistic environment: vulnerable objects (e.g. buildings can be destroyed and built either), drainable resources (mines, forests, animals), dynamic terrain that affects visibility, speed, moral and health.

Complex society: if you are a leader your decisions affects other players and vice versa the players activities affects the leaders position.

The game is continuously changing: periods with full of action and peaceful times are varying during the game according to players’ behaviour. 

Novus Mundus is an open world and has its own declared history which is partly overlapped by our world’s history. In the beginning only one ethnic group is known, that is the Native Americans. 
A few remarkable events are highlighted in Novus Mundus’s history. These events can be discovered one by one by the players (e.g. treasure of the Knights Templar, red haired native american tribe, El Dorado, Inca Gold, The Fountain of Youth, Nazca Lines, mystery of Machu Picchu, etc.). 
In the beginning of the game a few villages and cities of the Aztec, of the Inca and the Maya Empires exist, but these tribes are far away from the starting points.One of the key features of Novus Mundus is that it is a fully open world (with sandbox elements) without restrictions. You can go wherever and do whatever you want.Each character has a detailed description of their abilities and attributes, which are the following: health, ethics, energy, level of character, experience, battle experience, profession and level of profession, speed, hunger, skills (e.g. sneaking), tribe or settlement rank, etc.. 
Every character has a base camp where they live and where they are reborn in case of death. In the beginning the players can choose their names, which tribe they would like to belong to and generate a look (head, face painting, hair, etc.) but there will be an option for players to upload their own photos and ones that are made by a graphic designer of Novus Mundus. 
The players can also choose from the following professions: fisherman, hunter, chef, shaman, gunsmith, craftsman, forester, ostler, thief, hit man, spy, sharpshooter, etc.
Finally, the players can set whether they would like to be a beginner or an advanced player. This setting affects their birthplace.
If they choose beginner level, the players will be born in a camp where they will be guided through the basics of the game. If they choose to be born as an advanced player, they will be born in a higher level camp where they immediately become a fully contributing resident of the camp. From there begins the game!A newborn player has a loin-cloth, a minimum set of tools (depending on the chosen profession) and a minimum amount of shells. Shells function as money between Native Americans in the first phase of the game, later when the pioneers arrive, this will change. 
All characters must eat and have rest (these can be modified and extruded by infusion of herbs, totems or shaman magic).
Practically, a player can do anything with his character that is why Novus Mundus called a totally free and realistic world. But first it is suggested that characters work something to earn shells, or prepare something that can be sold. Work can be anything based on the chosen profession, e.g. hunting, fishing, etc. 
By the time the players earn enough shells to buy weapons and any other stuff, they can start the adventures and develop their characters!Basically, the Indians life is either about battles and honour or about peaceful living in harmony. In Novus Mundus you have the opportunity for both,it’s up to you! 


In the game you can build your own camp, fulfill executive positions (e.g. chieftain, second in command, shaman, soul rider, first hunter, leader of women, shaman mate, scout, grey haired wise chieftain, best warrior title, etc.), start wars, discover new areas or maintain peaceful diplomatic relationships (e.g. commercial agreements).
The game is fully realistic, so every object in Novus Mundus depreciates with time, even animals gets older slowly. The characters move, fight, act in real time, which gives the opportunity to use tactical elements, e.g. an observer can be sent to the hill to view further whilst the others are hiding at the bottom of the hill ready to attack. Speed of moving and visibility is realistic, too. Character speed can be developed and increased with magic during the game. Visibility is reduced when you are moving in a forest (you cannot see other parts of the map) and also dynamic elements of the game can have other effects (Fog Of War).One of the unique features of Novus Mundus is non-player character (NPC) soldiers. Besides active players, NPC soldiers are part of the game, you can hire them and they protect your camp or attack hostile camps according to your commands.
Adventures are like mini games in Novus Mundus, which makes it more interesting and colorful. According to the type of your character and your level, you can participate in and solve different adventures like historical explorations where you can discover secret places, historical events and treasures (e.g. El Dorado, Inca Gold, The Fountain of Youth, Nazca Lines, mystery of Machu Picchu, villages and cities of Aztec, Inca and Maya empires).Registration and usage of Novus Mundus will be free but there will be a wide range of extra functions in the game that will be available for credits:

Magic effects


NPC guards and NPC soldiers


Executive positions


Adventures


Uploading your own photo as avatar


Uploading your own photo made by graphic designer of Novus Mundus


Buying unique weapons and objects


Internal market


Etc.

As I wrote above, time is passing in Novus Mundus and there is a continuous technical and historical development that makes the game more exciting. Here you can see the outline of the scenarios of Novus Mundus:
1. Life or death scenario – Era of the Native Americans: 
In the first period of Novus Mundus, Indigenous rule the world, you can act like them, work, fund a new camp, become a chieftain, make war, take part in adventures, etc.

4. Strategic scenario – Formation of Regular forces and War of Independence:

The characters can join the army (or navy), and become an officer. The taxes levied by the old country are getting stifling so the War of Independence is about to happen and new ethnical groups appear from Asia and Africa.
5. Forts and duels scenario – Wild West:

This is the game where Match-3 fans meet an amazing new world of role-playing adventures. Create your unique avatar and compete with your friends to save the world from Ancient Evil.
We are fans of the Puzzle Quest series and the entire genre of RPG. Our wives don't allow us to play the 'big' games on PCs. That's why, with your help, we're creating an exciting experience for mobile devices you can play anywhere - any time.




Why this game is better than Puzzle Quest.




You can choose up to 3 or more characters to include on your team (not only monsters but also your friends in the future).

PvP will be introduced to our game in the near future.
Advanced skill / talent system.
You don't need to wait for an opponent's move, you are always in control and proactive.
CCG system with Evolution features (each Common card can be upgraded up to the Epic card).
Extended social interaction between players (cooperation with friends, guilds, etc).
Dungeons and raid bosses.




Why do we need funding?


Our games are great because they are player-driven.
We look for great ideas and feedback that only you can provide and we like to offer as many cool features as possible to enhance the player experience: PvP, (social interaction) party with friends, guilds, auctions, dungeons, raid bosses, awesome music themes, etc.
All of these features are available on your phone - where ever you go.
The game will launch in the App Store and get localization in many languages.

Our schedule:  60 days for the Beta. We plan to release it at the same time we finish our funding campaign then roll out weekly updates so you can experience the progress.
About us: We are a team of professionals that have roots in old casual industry. Worked together on famous titles Mah Jong Quest, Jewel Quest and others. You can find much more information by clicking the link below:

<li>This campaign will support the development of <i>2nd Story</i>.  We want to put the tools for story-mapping into the hands of as many people as possible, making it easy to start telling, documenting, and sharing stories in the places that matter to you.  <br/>
</li>
<li>Together we can develop <i>2nd Story</i> into an intuitive, accessible, free tool for mapping the story landscape.  We can make it possible for anyone with a mobile device to shape a richer sense of where they are.

<li>I've been moved so many times by the stories I'm hearing from people I've never met before.  It has shifted my perceptions and rocked my stereotypes.  Connected me to neighbors, including marginalized communities, on another level.  Opened up my heart.  People are surprisingly ready to tell and to listen.  And when we tell our story, we are re-shaping our lives and the minds of those around us.<br/>

</li>
<li>$5 or $10 can help if that is what works for you right now!  For donations of $ 25 (Contour) we can offer a limited-edition DVD of <i>2nd Story: Blood Alley</i>, our first story-map collection.  $ 50 (Compass Rose) will get you the DVD and a preview invitation to the live launch of the project in Vancouver.  $ 100  (Legend) gets you all of that plus a gift from awesome social enterprises like East Van Roasters, The Urban Farm, or The Window art shop.  For $250 (Globe) you get the whole shebang, and an invite to a special Producers' reception with artists and participants.<br/>
</li>
<li>We promise to dedicate 100% of funds raised to this project.  Though fees will be higher if we don't reach our goal, we will put every dollar raised towards the project and keep fundraising!  We have already come this far, gathering 60+ stories, filming 8 short videos, developing a working prototype of the app: we will see it through.  That's what we do.<br/>

<br/>is a game which is actually based on love between a boy called Francy and his sweet girl Mary, a love which was born from the shifty eyes during a run in the park and turned into something so big and beautiful, to push our friend to run every day for miles only because he wants to meet her loved one and give her freshly picked beautiful flowers.

GaDoDev is a team of italian people that develop video games (and more..) since before man walked upright and humanity knew Nutella, Coca Cola and Ikea. Professional musicians and cartoonists, daily engaged in the creation of works of art such as the much-loved cartoon characters, constantly working group to provide HD graphics and exciting music. The team's motto is simple and concise: << Have fun and entertain ! >>
Today, we are pleased to announce the upcoming release of our latest creative endeavor: Running Twister - Save your Love, an advanced running game playable on smartphones and tablets Android, iOS and Windows Mobile but also on the Desktop PC.


- INTRODUCTION -Love is definitely the hub around which all things rotate. Who of you have never loved? we are not only talking about people but also animals or even simple things, smells on which we are connected, because they remind us some past facts happened. But the real question we should be asking is : << how would I react if one day anyone or anything takes away what I love? >>
- RUNNING TWISTER SAVE YOUR LOVE -
                
is a game which is actually based on love between a boy called Francy and his sweet girl Mary, a love which was born from the shifty eyes during a run in the park and turned into something so big and beautiful, to push our friend to run every day for miles only because he wants to meet her loved one and give her freshly picked beautiful flowers. But, as usual in cases like this one…danger is always lurking !

 -THE STORY -

                     
<< One day, one of those to clearly forget, the city was struck and destroyed by a terrible tornado, and among other things, a chemical factory in which items and experiments were dangerous!Hideous creatures were released and nothing was ever the same, especially after Francy found that Mery was quick from one of those horrible creatures.  >>
                                                     

At this point, let’s get back to the original question: “how would I react if one day anyone or anything takes away what I love ?"" 
                                   
We do not know your reaction, but we truly know that our fearless hero, even though he will get through an awkward situation (since the tornado will bring out all the clothes) will face all kinds of difficulties in order retrieve his clothes and free her loved one !

<h4><span>SELMA</span></h4>
<p><span>Little girl in a heap of trouble.  Desperate for help, she turns to an unlike ally and follows him since. Not much is known about her past or her family but one thing is certain – she is far from ordinary.</span></p>
<h4>WISP</h4>
<p>( will-o'-the-wisp ;ignis fatuus) atmospheric ghost light seen by travellers at night, especially over bogs, swamps or marshes. It resembles a flickering lamp and is said to recede if approached. The phenomenon is known by a variety of names in much of European folklore.</p>

<p><span>What little there is to know about the plot initially, only emphasizes the restlessness that soaks the game. What the player knows for sure, is that the protagonist – Selma is following the wisp into the weird land inside her wardrobe after something disturbing  happens in her home. </span></p>
<p>As You play along, you will collect bits and pieces of information that might ( or might not) help you fill the blank spaces in the story and answer the questions. Keep at it, as the ending will keep you on the edge of your seat.  </p>

<br/><p><span>As we have set upon our path of creating “Selma and the wisp”, one of our main goals was to deliver the players an original experience rather that generic throwback. Same goes for the soundtrack accompanying  Selma throughout her journey. </span></p>
<p>And so, we turned to our talented musician friend - Konrad Koziński, whom we have learnt to trust completely during previous collaborations.  The music perfectly captures and complements the game’s atmosphere, making the gameplay even more intense.</p>

Imagine you were lost with no one to help.

Imagine you were a child facing its worst nightmare.In utter darkness even the dimmest trickle of light means hope.Follow the wisp. Collect the lights. Don’t look back.





Here is the deal: The game we are developing is in fact finished and soon to be published anyway. Why have we started this campaign then? 
What we are doing  is giving You the opportunity to support us in order to enjoy our game even more.  With your help we can produce more levels, new puzzles etc. We will even throw in a few boss fights if you want.Game developing, as it turns out, costs time and money, so we decided to turn to the gaming community and allow You to decide whether You want to see Selma following the wisp further down the rabbit hole.




“Selma and the wisp” is a platform game with a particularly unsettling atmosphere, that makes it even more extraordinary. Not only is it densely packed with  logical puzzles that will test your wits but has an arcade game elements that require skills as well.
Inspired by such cult titles like “Limbo” or “Badlands”, it stands proudly in a row with its predecessors, still offering new and unique features.
First and foremost, the two characters co-dependant control systems which forces the player to take care of two characters at the same time.
Masterly crafted low-poly models combined with a spectacular animations are a whole different story. With our visionary art-director responsible for the graphics and aesthetics, every model and every location is a carefully designed masterpiece.

FEATURES

10 exciting and diverse levels
unique character-co-dependent control system 
surprising character and plot development
content suitable for players of age 16+ ( violence, blood, disturbing content, sugestive themes, gore scenes)
mesmerazing low-poly models


















SELMA
Little girl in a heap of trouble.  Desperate for help, she turns to an unlike ally and follows him since. Not much is known about her past or her family but one thing is certain – she is far from ordinary.
WISP
( will-o'-the-wisp ;ignis fatuus) atmospheric ghost light seen by travellers at night, especially over bogs, swamps or marshes. It resembles a flickering lamp and is said to recede if approached. The phenomenon is known by a variety of names in much of European folklore.









What little there is to know about the plot initially, only emphasizes the restlessness that soaks the game. What the player knows for sure, is that the protagonist – Selma is following the wisp into the weird land inside her wardrobe after something disturbing  happens in her home. 
As You play along, you will collect bits and pieces of information that might ( or might not) help you fill the blank spaces in the story and answer the questions. Keep at it, as the ending will keep you on the edge of your seat.  









As we have set upon our path of creating “Selma and the wisp”, one of our main goals was to deliver the players an original experience rather that generic throwback. Same goes for the soundtrack accompanying  Selma throughout her journey. 
And so, we turned to our talented musician friend - Konrad Koziński, whom we have learnt to trust completely during previous collaborations.  The music perfectly captures and complements the game’s atmosphere, making the gameplay even more intense.

<h3>Summary &amp; Impact</h3>
The gaming industry is an ever changing market, with that a lot of companies loose a lot of funding and lay off some if not all of their staff. This is what happened to me recently, I was let go from my company along with half of the staff. The worst part is I was living paycheck to paycheck trying to raise my family. Many of you know its not easy to raise a family on a single income. And I'm not one who likes to sit around and wait for things to happen. I have applied to over 30 companies and some for multiple positions. A few years ago when I was in my last month of college and I got the chance to go to GDC 2011. I found that to be more of an impact to companies than just sending my resume off into a black hole. So since I dont have a job at the moment, I dont really have any perks to give out, just more of a big thank you! I know that doesnt really mean much to some people, but its better to say to yourself that I just helped someone get one step closer to finding a job. And thats what helps put faith back into humainty. All the funding will help pay for a plane ticket round trip, my hotel room (cheapest one I can find), meals, and my pass for GDC. If I get 100% of my funding, I will be able to get the Summits, Tutorials &amp; Bootcamps Pass, which will also help me get into some tutorials that will help me in my future careers. If I dont get all my funding, I will only go for the Expo Pass which will let me get to the confrence room floor and talk to all the companies there.</div></div>","Summary & Impact

Many of you know its not easy to raise a family on a single income. And I'm not one who likes to sit around and wait for things to happen. I have applied to over 30 companies and some for multiple positions. A few years ago when I was in my last month of college and I got the chance to go to GDC 2011. I found that to be more of an impact to companies than just sending my resume off into a black hole. So since I dont have a job at the moment, I dont really have any perks to give out, just more of a big thank you! I know that doesnt really mean much to some people, but its better to say to yourself that I just helped someone get one step closer to finding a job. And thats what helps put faith back into humainty. All the funding will help pay for a plane ticket round trip, my hotel room (cheapest one I can find), meals, and my pass for GDC. If I get 100% of my funding, I will be able to get the Summits, Tutorials & Bootcamps Pass, which will also help me get into some tutorials that will help me in my future careers. If I dont get all my funding, I will only go for the Expo Pass which will let me get to the confrence room floor and talk to all the companies there.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

A lot of people liked it and it was my heart's work, so I would love to make a sequel.In order to do that, I need to eat and sleep. That's where you come in!








Skullz is a single player adventure game, unfolding a strange story starring a cast of six characters over four chapters with about a dozen screens each. It's made in flash, playable for free, right in your browser.



Skullz 2 is gonna continue the story of the first game while providing a back story for many of the established characters. There will be a new world to discover, with all-new backgrounds, a new soundtrack, branching paths, new and old characters to meet and interact with and, of course, lots and lots of paradoxes. Basically, Skullz 2 will be like it's predecessor, except bigger, better, cooler, sweeter , doper, sicker and just all-around mind-blowing.




My name is Feliks Balzer. I'm an art student from Germany, just about to be done with college. The game Skullz was my Bachelor's Thesis, made entirely by myself on the last legs of funding I had for my studies.



Being almost done being a student, I was planning on just getting some kinda job and trying to see where to go from there, but after the game was received so well, I could see that shining star at the edge of the horizon, and I decided to try and see if I can make the dream of being a truly independent video game developer reality with this crowd funding campaign.



By the time you're reading this, I will already have started developing the game. I will post frequent updates about the development process at my development blog, and generally be very responsive via my twitter account @pizzamakesgames.

I'll keep that up until the crowd funding period is over. Then, depending on whether or not the funding goal was reached, different things will happen:

At this point I'll have been developing the game for a month straight, all the while keeping you posted through twitter, my devblog and the odd mail so that you can be sure that I'm working hard on what you paid for. With the 500€ goal reached, I will have my rent paid for a whole month with enough money left for food. I'd take my time finishing the game up, making sure that everything's nice and smooth and release it somewhere within February, along with the soundtrack and lots of toots and whistles.

<em><strong>Exodus: Proxima Centauri</strong></em> uses several board game mechanics which contribute to the games strategical aspect and replay value.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Resource management - the resources players collect are constantly depleting and thus require further mining for new discoveries. Also, players pay tax for their income</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Bidding - every turn a political decision is reached through voting, followed by a bid for the turn order</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Simultaneous action selection </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Simultaneous movement - players make decisions regarding the movement of their space ships simultaneously using Movement Tokens, giving the game a realistic feeling</li>

</div></div>","NSKN Legendary Games is proud to present Exodus: Proxima Centauri, an epic board game for 2-6 players about economy, politics, technology and conquest.
This campaign concludes 15 months of hard work, imagination, research and testing - bringing to life a dream we were chasing - a full civilization game set up in a futuristic universe. 
Your support will help us make this dream reality and in exchange you will be the first to enjoy it.



After a devastating nuclear war, six human factions are seeking shelter in the Centauri system. On the verge of extinction, the humans are saved by a superior civilization, allegedly the Centaurians, and each faction is given a fresh start on a new planet. Thus the exodus of humanity seems to have ended on the planets orbiting the star called Proxima Centauri. When the Centaurians announce their departure, the struggle for power commences once again.  
 



Our goal is to raise $7500. We will use the money to finalize the production and deliver the game boxes to you in the shortest amount of time possible.
Once we reach the main goal, several exclusive promos and expansions can be unlocked and we'll make sure they're in every game box. 

 
On the modular map, every player has a Home Planet from which he start his expansion. Using space ships, players will fight the other player and deploy population on new planets and asteroids to increase their influence and income. At the same time, they will develop technologies, build new ships and customize them for maximum efficiency.

 
Every turn, players go through five stages.
 
In the Upkeep Stage the players repair their ships, receive their resources and pay tax
 
During the Political Stage the player reunited in the High Council decide on the turn's political decision, followed by bidding for the new turn order and the Bonus Action decision.
 

 
The Action Stage is the highlight of each turn, when the players develop their rising empire. Every player has two Actions which they play simultaneously and two optional Reactions.

The possible Actions are:


Research allows learning and using one of the 28 technologies on the player board, military, transport or civilian





Trade helps players exchange resources with the bank




Banking provides a little bit of extra income




Mining provides extra resources on the depleted planets 




Buy Upgrades - the players can purchase ship upgrades or Weapons of Mass Destruction that they have previously researched and customize their ship blueprints





Build Ships - new space ships can be constructed on the players' home planets



During the following stage, all players may fire their Weapons of Mass Destruction targeting resources, population or the planets themselves.
 
The two Conquest Stages allow the players to expand their empires. Each player moves his ships, fights opposing space ships and may colonize new planets and asteroids. 
 
 



48 palstic space ships
30 dice
150 wooden populatin cubes
185 wooden resource cylinders
24 ship blue prints
6 player boards (A4)
43 hex tiles that make up the modular map
42 action cards - 6 foar each player and 6 bonus actions
6 info cards and 6 turn order cards
33 Centaurian Resistance cards
30 political cards
18 resistance ships tokens
200+ ship and planetary upgrades tokens






Exodus: Proxima Centauri uses several board game mechanics which contribute to the games strategical aspect and replay value.
 


Resource management - the resources players collect are constantly depleting and thus require further mining for new discoveries. Also, players pay tax for their income




Bidding - every turn a political decision is reached through voting, followed by a bid for the turn order




Simultaneous action selection 




Simultaneous movement - players make decisions regarding the movement of their space ships simultaneously using Movement Tokens, giving the game a realistic feeling

very high quality POLYURETHANE resin that will last you a lifetime!</p>
<p>To help you helping us, we have extended this offer to all models
available in the range, not only the new desert series, so you can
choose any pack from this range as your reward!</p>

campaign, but you would like to see these products added to our

<h1>WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?</h1>
<p>Hi guys, this is Claudio from Baueda Wargames ltd. We are already
producing a large range of high quality resin cast wargame terrain,
designed specifically for 15mm WWII miniatures and fully compatible
with <strong>Flames of War™</strong> rules. Currently this range
already include over 30 different packs of scenic bases, objectives,
bunkers, fortifications and entrenchments, covering rural and urban
theatres and including also a couple specifically designed with a
desert theme. You can find plenty more pictures and full details of
the full range at <a href=""http://www.baueda.com/cama.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.baueda.com/cama.html</a></p>
<p>We now want to add a number of new codes to complete the desert
series, including a sandbag bunker!</p>
<p>While the range is designed specifically with a deser feel most of
these models can be used for many more armies and settings than the
North African campaign, all sandbag emplacement for instance would be
perfect also for the Vietnam war!</p>
<h1>WHY INDIEGOGO? 
</h1>
<p>The actual models sculpting is completed and we now need your help
funding the actual production, including making multiple production
molds for all the models.</p>
<p>Funds raised will be used for production molds, casting the goods
and shipping them off to you.</p>
<h1>WHAT WE NEED &amp; WHAT YOU GET</h1>
<p>We need your hard earned cash to finance the costs of putting more
awesome new models in production. Normally we pay out of our pockets
in advance to add new items to our ever-growing catalog, but then we
have to wait until we have recovered this initial investment before
we can afford to release more. In this way we can recover part of the
investment faster and bring yet more goodies to you faster! You get
the option to acquire very high quality products with a substantial
discount and you can get them even before they are added to our
catalog and begin to ship to retailers worldwide!</p>
<p>Please be warned that ALL our products are not toys and are not
intended for children!

<p>Finish: all items are supplied as unpainted plain castings.</p><p>Please remember that as with all resin models these <strong>have
to be washed thoroughly</strong> with hot water and a strong

off!

</p><h1>RISKS AND CHALLENGES</h1>
<p>I
have been making and selling wargame models for more than ten years
now, first as a part time job and then, over the last seven years as
a full time job. With the help of other professional artists we have
created hundreds of successful wargame products which we currently
manufacture and sell, both directly and through a worldwide network
of distributors and retailers. Baueda Wargames has already become a
brand recognized for the quality of its products and service and we
intend to continue this way!</p>
<p>The
main risk involved in this project is that it becomes such a runaway
success that will stretch our production capacity so far that there
will be a few days delay in shipping your order. Please do your best
to make this happen and I'll personally guarantee we will add some
free extras to make up for any eventual delay in this case! :)</p>
<p>
</p><h1>WHO ARE WE?</h1>
<p>BAUEDA
WARGAMES LTD. is a small British Company registered in England in
2005 with Reg. No. 5511646 It specializes in developing high quality
tabletop wargame accessories and miniatures. Most of our products
have been designed and sculpted by myself, my name is Claudio Berni
and I've been working as a professional freelance artist most of my
life; I've been working in the game industry since 1994 doing
illustrations, 3D models, concept art and game design. Recently I
have made the graphics for all the diagrams in the “Field of Glory”
series of rulebooks published by Osprey. You can see some samples of
my previous work including paintings, illustrations and concept art
here: <a href=""http://www.dreamsstudio.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.dreamsstudio.com/</a> <br/><br/></p><p>
</p></div>","Great quality
material, accurately scaled and well researched models, realistic
looking fortifications at the very best!
At BAUEDA we pride ourselves on our attention to historical
accuracy and this range is here to do justice to the more modern
battlefields, starting with WWII.
All scenic bases are especially designed to be compatible
with Flames of War™ rules. All our models are made with
very high quality POLYURETHANE resin that will last you a lifetime!
To help you helping us, we have extended this offer to all models
available in the range, not only the new desert series, so you can
choose any pack from this range as your reward!
If for any reason you still don't want or can't contribute to the
campaign, but you would like to see these products added to our
catalog anyway, so that they will soon be available also from your
local retailer then please help to get the word out, let your friends
know, share this on facebook and make some noise about this campaign
in your local gaming community! You'll have our everlasting gratitude
and will help us bringing to life yet more new fantastic models!
Thank you and have fun! 

WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?
Hi guys, this is Claudio from Baueda Wargames ltd. We are already
producing a large range of high quality resin cast wargame terrain,
designed specifically for 15mm WWII miniatures and fully compatible
with Flames of War™ rules. Currently this range
already include over 30 different packs of scenic bases, objectives,
bunkers, fortifications and entrenchments, covering rural and urban
theatres and including also a couple specifically designed with a
desert theme. You can find plenty more pictures and full details of
the full range at http://www.baueda.com/cama.html
We now want to add a number of new codes to complete the desert
series, including a sandbag bunker!
While the range is designed specifically with a deser feel most of
these models can be used for many more armies and settings than the
North African campaign, all sandbag emplacement for instance would be
perfect also for the Vietnam war!
WHY INDIEGOGO? 

The actual models sculpting is completed and we now need your help
funding the actual production, including making multiple production
molds for all the models.
Funds raised will be used for production molds, casting the goods
and shipping them off to you.
WHAT WE NEED & WHAT YOU GET
We need your hard earned cash to finance the costs of putting more
awesome new models in production. Normally we pay out of our pockets
in advance to add new items to our ever-growing catalog, but then we
have to wait until we have recovered this initial investment before
we can afford to release more. In this way we can recover part of the
investment faster and bring yet more goodies to you faster! You get
the option to acquire very high quality products with a substantial
discount and you can get them even before they are added to our
catalog and begin to ship to retailers worldwide!
Please be warned that ALL our products are not toys and are not
intended for children!

etc. Contains 1 x sandbag bunker body, 1 x sandbag bunker roof, 1 x
small scenic base.
15A25CB – Medium battery emplacement (desert) – This
selection counts as two packs!

perfect for most anti-tank, mortar and anti-aircraft artillery
platoons and are specifically designed so that the space inside each
emplacement is large enough to accommodate one Flames of War medium
base, either front on or sideways. This is a large pack that include
everything you need to fortify a full battery: three medium sandbag
emplacements for the gun bases, a medium scenic base for the staff,
one small scenic base for command or spotters and one medium dug-in marker.

theme and designed to accommodate four 15mm figures. These bases are

bases are almost flat these are approximately 2mm thick and on top of

never have to touch the figures themselves!

selection of six different styles out of eight different designs, in
all cases the models include all sorts of improvised repairs that
troops will naturally look for and use for cover and of course plenty
of deep carved details to help you in painting them! 

Finish: all items are supplied as unpainted plain castings.Please remember that as with all resin models these have
to be washed thoroughly with hot water and a strong
detergent before painting, to clean off all traces of mold release
agent. If you don't follow this simple precaution the paint may flake
off!

To

have to make an extra contribution adding the difference between the
two perks. Click on “contribute now” and add the amount without

of course!) we
will send you an e-mail asking you what options will you like to
choose for your Perks and at that time you will only need to tell us
what items you want added to your shipment.
Please
note that this offer is subject to availability, so if you order an
item that happens not to be in stock for whatsoever reason at the
time your Perk is due to ship, we may have to delay shipping for a
few days until your order is complete.
If

RISKS AND CHALLENGES
I
have been making and selling wargame models for more than ten years
now, first as a part time job and then, over the last seven years as
a full time job. With the help of other professional artists we have
created hundreds of successful wargame products which we currently
manufacture and sell, both directly and through a worldwide network
of distributors and retailers. Baueda Wargames has already become a
brand recognized for the quality of its products and service and we
intend to continue this way!
The
main risk involved in this project is that it becomes such a runaway
success that will stretch our production capacity so far that there
will be a few days delay in shipping your order. Please do your best
to make this happen and I'll personally guarantee we will add some
free extras to make up for any eventual delay in this case! :)

WHO ARE WE?
BAUEDA
WARGAMES LTD. is a small British Company registered in England in
2005 with Reg. No. 5511646 It specializes in developing high quality
tabletop wargame accessories and miniatures. Most of our products
have been designed and sculpted by myself, my name is Claudio Berni
and I've been working as a professional freelance artist most of my
life; I've been working in the game industry since 1994 doing
illustrations, 3D models, concept art and game design. Recently I
have made the graphics for all the diagrams in the “Field of Glory”
series of rulebooks published by Osprey. You can see some samples of
my previous work including paintings, illustrations and concept art

<h2>Welcome to the Greebo Nippo Goblin funding campaign!</h2>
<p> Greebo's miniatures is a well known manufacturer of miniatures, born for fantasy football and recently started  creating and producing  board games and different type of fantasy sports game.</p>
<p> We're trying to continue the production of what we used to do, and so to reach a complete variety of teams for fantasy football, supported by great designers and remarkable sculptors. In particular there is a project that goes on very slowly for years, due to lack of funds entirely self-financed.</p>
<p> The project involves the Nippo Goblin, Nipponese greenskins with a series of themed  secret weapons and traditional oriental demonic trolls who have been loudly requested for years from the audience.</p>
<p>Nowadays only two miniatures were produced, and now we would like to have your help for letting the remaining nine goblins, the troll and the coach to be created, produced and available!</p>
<p><strong> If we will reach the required amount  for the sculpture and the creation of the molds, we will create a team of 12 different high quality pieces ready to be painted and played, and if we will go over the reach we will sculpt extra Geisha Goblin as  cheerleader!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Rewards</h3>
<p>We would like to offer rewards them in four ""bands"" which are based on the cost of production and future MSRP (<em>Manufacturer's suggested retail price)</em></p>

<li>Deer populations require food and forests to hide in, thus you can force a deer population to relocate due to heavy deforestation or harvesting the plants they eat.</li>
<li>Berries, for example, starts to grow during the early summer and will be ripe in the fall. Each year they will provide more, unless disturbed.</li>

They are lost somewhere with nothing but some tools, the clothes on their backs and some food in their backpacks. Your task is to guide them and keep them alive in a world that changes with the seasons and the weather. You can:
Gather edible plants; fish in rivers and lakes; plant crops and hunt for game
Cut down trees and break rocks to get building materials
Build simple shelters or more permanent structures such as cabins and barns
Explore the world to find new resources or suitable places to settle
Set policies that affect the behavior and interaction of your settlers
Setup the production of tools, clothing, fuel and other materials
Your settlers are individuals. They have personal preferences for work and leisure. They have different sensitivities for hot and cold weather, different stamina levels and different calorie needs.The world of Homestead features:
A large open world that contains different types of physical geography
A day/night cycle that affects the settlers, in terms of darkness and sleep cycle
Weather that changes with the time of the day and the seasons
A dynamic ecosystem in which plants and animals affect each other
AI:s that you can trade and interact with

<br/><p>My name is Wojciech Gal and with my wife Agnieszka Gal we are creating team ZBB Games, based in Malbork, Poland.</p>
<p>I have been active on Polish gaming scene since 2008. Starting in journalism, I've quickly jumped to games review and commentary on YouTube which I continue to this day.</p>
<p>In late 2013 I've decided to go step further and after gathering money, when I was working on immigration in United Kingdom, I was able to mainly focus my energy on gaming programming.  The fruit of my work is Mumbis, game that I want to present to You today.</p>
<p>With a little help from IndieGoGo community we will be able to finish Mumbis on Windows, Mac and Linux, improve audio and visual assets, as well as gather minimum founds to promote our game.</p>
<p>Mumbis is currently in alpha development stage.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/692277/files/20140703101905-mumbis_what_is_mumbis.png?1404407945"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Mumbis is a rare combination of board game and action rogue­like. You will be visiting cities, encountering camps and merchant posts, but most importantly you will be travelling the land of Mumbis in your vehicle and camp in wilderness. All of those elements will be randomly generated for each of your new game.</p>
<p>Game­play is mainly focused on survival. In order to succeed in your mission one of your heroes have to destroy Nerh’Zul. That means that you have to learn how to survive on your journey.

<p>As with developing any video game there are a lot of risks and costs involved... But we are 100% confident that ZBB Games will overcome and achieve the goals we set forth.</p>
<p>1. Release Date- Late 2014: If it would just depend on our two we could release our game in the next few months, but due to Steam Greenlight and others interested publishers we need to plan to deliver our game simultaneously on all hardware platforms, as well as all, available for us, publishing platforms. Therefore late 2014 is the most secure date that we can estimate for now.</p>
<p>2. Quality: Matching the quality of Mumbis and resolving all found development bugs prior to it's release date. We cannot assure that we will find all of them, before game launch date, but the game will be provided with free of charge patches to do so after the launch.</p>
<p>3. Distribution: We are currently on Steam Greenlight as many of other developers from IndieGoGo gaming campaigns. Depending on the result of our vote- if we would get approve to publish on Steam, backers will be able to get their activation code for their gaming platform. We cannot assure Steam's approve for publishing, because it not depends on us.<br/></p>
<p>5. As requested by PayPal: ""The delivery of rewards or perks are subject to best efforts and not guaranteed."" (We don't foresee this being a problem, but we are required to include it.)</p>

</div> <p>Thank You for Your time and have a nice day!</p></div>","My name is Wojciech Gal and with my wife Agnieszka Gal we are creating team ZBB Games, based in Malbork, Poland.
I have been active on Polish gaming scene since 2008. Starting in journalism, I've quickly jumped to games review and commentary on YouTube which I continue to this day.
In late 2013 I've decided to go step further and after gathering money, when I was working on immigration in United Kingdom, I was able to mainly focus my energy on gaming programming.  The fruit of my work is Mumbis, game that I want to present to You today.
With a little help from IndieGoGo community we will be able to finish Mumbis on Windows, Mac and Linux, improve audio and visual assets, as well as gather minimum founds to promote our game.
Mumbis is currently in alpha development stage.



Mumbis is a rare combination of board game and action rogue­like. You will be visiting cities, encountering camps and merchant posts, but most importantly you will be travelling the land of Mumbis in your vehicle and camp in wilderness. All of those elements will be randomly generated for each of your new game.
Game­play is mainly focused on survival. In order to succeed in your mission one of your heroes have to destroy Nerh’Zul. That means that you have to learn how to survive on your journey. Scavenge and gather supplies, cure party members, repair your vehicle and improve your equipment. All of these to manage and more for player to discover.This is just a quick summary of our project. If you wish to learn more about the game please visit our detailed FAQ at Mumbis FAQ, and check out our development blog at ZlyBratBlizniak.pl.






 
We truly believe in this project, and we would like to be able to invest our money in it. Problem that we currently having is very similar to other campaings on IndieGoGo- we are struggling with the current economic state in Poland, and for us funding projects has become more difficult than ever.

The total estimated minimal cost for finishing the development of Mumbis is €2200, but we will fund €768, that's around 1/3 of whole project. We believe in our project and that's a real proof of it. 
The rest €1432 is up to IndieGoGo community. Your contribution will be used to finalize our little rouguelike. Below I present to You pie chart with ""things to buy"" and summary of costs:

More detailed:

GML Modules, are Linux and Mac export modules, as well as YYC- more powerful compiler for programming library in which Mubmis is developed,

Audio Assets is audio (music, game sounds, effects and ambient) library that will be used in Mumbis,
Visual Assets is graphics and animation library that will be used in our game,

Promotion Costs are advertisements, promotional materials and builds, as well as other forms of promotion of Mumbis through internet and media,

Minor Costs are all the little costs related to licensing, server costs, testing on various platforms and other unplanned expenses.





If you wish to help us finalize Mumbis, the best way it to choose a perk that is best suited for You and support us.

NPC Relations - NPCs who like each other are more likely to buy from each other, to help each other out in times of need, and to gossip.

Gossip - Acts the player carries out will become known to the town members if it is witnessed, or if one of them is told.

Romance - Court NPCs and win their favour in order to marry.

Back Story - A randomized back story for each NPC which will change the way they behave and how they react to situations.


Settle and build your own town - Create a town of your own, and choose to become mayor or appoint someone else (player or NPC). The surroundings of the town will influence what kind of business is best suited to it, and so what class and trade of people it will attract (for example, a town near a large area of water is likely to become a fishing/trading port, whereas one further inland could be a small farming village).
Advanced Inventory - Chests to store items in, weight system.
Trade - Swap items with other players/NPCs.

Technology
The game is being developed using the LÖVE engine, and being written in Lua.
It is being developed primarily for Windows, though LÖVE also supports OS X and Ubuntu, so support for these platforms is also a possibility.


What We Need & What You Get

With partial funding, a basic version of the game will be completed (all of the Basic Features list will be implemented, and maybe a few of the more advanced features) and funds will go towards acquiring other aspects of the game such as art & sound effects.


Complete funding will ensure that a more advanced version of the game is completed (more of the Advanced Features list will be implemented).

Background
I have over four years experience in creating games and mods, and am currently studying game design at university.

Throughout my time developing games I have created many variations of this basic idea, a medieval RPG in which the player takes on a role within society and has the ability to create for themselves.
Much of my experience has been gained through creating game modes for Garry's Mod;


Medieval Roleplay - My first game mode, a simple medieval mod built on top of other mods, which gave the player the ability to mine and smith items. The old page for the mod can be found here, though the actual mod no longer works.
The Middle Ages - My follow up to the Medieval Roleplay game mode, added more advanced skills such as crafting and alchemy, and a simple inventory.  Experimented with a fantasy theme, as well as NPCs.
Garry's Mod Civilizations - Another take on the idea, this time more focused on realism, with pre-designed buildings to construct, and further advancements such as trading, chests, farming and a faction system. A demonstration of game play and features can be seen here.

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>Let me start off by introducing myself. I am a 22 year old entrepreneur with a young start up company and a passion for the gaming industry. My company 3BrosStudios was started with my long time two best friends. Our goal is to create innovative game titles to keep our video game enthusiasts coming back for more. I need help fundraising money, along with the support of my local community, to get my passion for video games out for the rest of the world to enjoy. </p>
<p>As of right now <strong>NovaScape </strong>is in its <strong>early design phase</strong> with much more work on the horizon. Were ready to move into the <strong>Development phase</strong>, the only issue is funding. I have been able to get NovaScape this far with family investments along with multiple loans but I need help with this final push. Its time for me to take NovaScape and 3 Bros Studios to the next level and <strong>dedicate 100%</strong> of my time and energy to this project. I am <strong>75%</strong> there and need help with this final push my make my vision a reality.</p>

<p><strong>NovaScape</strong> is a mobile phone based video game application, in which the player will control a spaceship using the gyroscope within their phone. The player will tilt their phone from left to right in order to control the side to side flying motion of their spaceship.</p>
<p>The inspiration behind <strong>NovaScape</strong> came from a very simple game I used to love and play called <strong>Cube Runner</strong>. The purpose of the game is to achieve a high score based on flying distance, the longer you fly by avoiding the obstacles the more your score would increase.  What I want to do is take Cube Runner to an entirely new level. NovaScape will have the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intuitive Gameplay Controls</strong></li>
<li><strong>Online Multiplayer</strong></li>
<li><strong>Global Leaderboards</strong></li>
<li><strong>User Customization</strong></li>
<li><strong>iTunes Playlist Connectivity</strong></li>
<li><strong>Facebook and GameCenter Integration</strong></li>

<p> </p>
<p>The purpose of the game is to achieve a high score by flying the greatest distance possible while avoiding incoming asteroids and meteors. The longer the player stays alive by avoiding these impacts the more their score will increase and the harder the game play will get. Such increasing difficulties will included; <strong><em>meteor showers</em></strong>, <strong>black holes</strong>, <strong>comet strikes</strong>, etc.</p>
<p>If the player crashes into such objects, their health bar will decrease and the Supernova will encroach ever closer. Better watch out! If you mess up too many times you will be engulfed within the fiery abyss to never see the universe and all its splendor again... Or you could just press replay and give it a second shot. <strong>Good Luck! Lets see if you got what it takes to NovaScape!</strong></p>

<h2><strong>The ""Continuous Runner"" Application Model</strong></h2>
<p>Right now the mobile market has a few #1 hit  sensation <strong>Continuous Runners</strong>. Continuous runner games are platform games in which the player character moves forward continuously through a theoretically endless game world. Game controls are limited to making the character jump, attack or perform some other special action.</p>
<p>The object of these games is to get as far as possible before the character dies. Endless running games have found particular success on mobile platforms, which are well-suited to the small set of controls these games require – often limited to a single screen tap for jumping.<strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Subway Surfer</strong> and <strong>Temple Run</strong> lead the ranks in the #1 most played mobile applications.</p>

<p>My name is Milly Beddall. I am 24 years old and I live in London. I am currently working for Aston Martin as there showroom host. I have been lucky enough to be a reasonably good skier, It is something I love, my family also love it and annoyingly for me are a lot better than I am!</p>
<p>I am so honoured to have been accepted as part of the Skiing With Heroes team as a buddy, It is through my boyfriend Tom that I intially heard about this extraordinary charity.</p>
<p>For those of you that have been skiing you will know the feeling is like nothing else. It gives you a sense of freedom like no other- the fresh air and scenery gives you a new lease of life.  The fact that this can be given back to wounded ex-soldiers who may have thought they would never get the chance to ski or do any sort of sport again is just such a great thing. </p>
<p>This is a chance to give people that have fought for their country something in return. Skiing can help with rehabilitation both physically and mentally.  They can start building up core muscle strength and use muscles they wouldn't otherwise be able to use. The outdoors and fresh air is good for their health and will hopefully make a difference to how they feel at the end of the trip.</p>
<p>Being a ski buddy will be an amazing opportunity to make the ex-soldiers time as fun and enjoyable as possible. We will have to be enthusiastic and energetic at all times- I am hoping to keep a smile on everyone's faces.</p>
<p>If I could go to Kloster's knowing I had raised the amount of money I am hoping to I think the trip will be perfect. As this is a relatively new chairty I would like to aim high to get a good start to the fundraising for 2013.</p>

<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<div>
<p>If you have been on a skiing trip you will know the extreme costs that go into it!</p>
<p>We have been asked to raise £750.00 each to cover flights, ski hire and ski passes.</p>
<p>Accomodation will be through contacts that the chairty has out in Klosters- We have been asked to give a small donation to whoemever we stay with. I imagine about £100 each will suffice. </p>
<p>Tom and I would also like to buy gifts so at the end of the trip supper we can give out prizes so everyone has something to take away with them.</p>
<p>We also need to pay for our food- lunches and suppers when we are out there.  I don't mind paying for the majority of this but it would be nice to have a small amount of extra money for the ocassional spagetti bolognaise if any of the ex-soldiers feel like it!</p>
<p>I would like to offer for anyone that donates:</p>
<p>£10 or under- A personal thank you email and updates of the trip</p>
<p>£30 or under- A written letter and some photographs of the trip after we have returned.</p>
<p>£50 or under-An Aston Martin Iphone case, a written letter and some photos after the rip.</p>
<p>£100 under or more- And Aston Martin Iphone case, magazine and poster, a written letter and some photos after the trip.</p>
<p>If there is anything specific you think would be nice to see or hear about from the week then I am open to ideas as well.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Apologies about the £2 perks below- The system seemed to crash on me and wouldn't allow me to delete the unwanted boxes!</p>
<h2><strong>The Impact</strong></h2>
<p>I really believe that this could change the lives of some people who might have thought nothing good was coming their way in 2013.</p>
<p>It is a way of showing that help is out there and they are not alone in their injuries. I think it is a great way of demonstrating how far chairities have come in being able to help give something back.</p>

<p>We are down to just under 3 days left in the campaign and while it looks unlikely that we will reach our goal, you can still help us finish strong.  We have decided that everyone who contributes to this campaign will automatically be bumped up a reward tier in regard to the digital content and in game credit.  There is still time to get the word out about this game and what we are trying to do for mobile games in general, so please help us in whatever ways you can!</p>
<h2 style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Update 2/25, Day 25</h2>
<p>We have uploaded a new video showing the successful testing of importing an animated character into the game engine.  With the engine being on the newer side it took some effort, but our talented team was able to sort through it.  Take a look <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dls_lhjQ3Io&amp;feature=share&amp;list=PLQATwkJuk3ZmTngShUy7iQK0pGb9ZT13z"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Also, just to reiterate the fact that this will not be more of the same for mobile, here are a few highlights.</p>
<ul>
<li style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Airship Downs will allow up to three games to be played at the same time using our player network</li>
<li style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">It will be extremely replayable, and will allow players to add more of the optional features as they learn how to play</li>
<li style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">The amount of content and features included will easily make this game worthy of a PC title, but we want to bring it to mobile devices</li>

<h2 style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Update 2/15, Day 15</h2>
<p>We are halfway through the campaign, and haven't quite reached it to the halfway mark yet, but that's OK!  We know that mobile video game players are ready for more game than what is currently out there, and we are still making headway on the project. </p>
<p>We have chosen the option on our campaign, which will allow us to recieve most of the funds collected, REGARDLESS of whether or not we make the goal.  Every dollar will help us out folks, so please help us by contributing or spreading the word.</p>
<p>The time for a mobile video game revolution will soon be upon us, and you can be a part of that now!!</p>
<h2 style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Update 2/8, Day 9</h2>
<p>We have uploaded some <a href=""http://youtu.be/N8ORt2Tkryk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">footage</a> from the city building portion of the game.  We are now working on the UI, so should have something cleaner within a week or so.  Also, don't be discouraged by the goal amoun, every little bit will help us get to the next stage of funding. </p>
<h2 style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Update 2/6, Day 7</h2>
<p>Don't give up on us yet folks, because we haven't given up on you!  We are working on getting some gameplay footage up within the next day, so stay tuned.  And don't forget that we have a <a href=""http://www.airshipdowns.com/tiki-view_forum.php?forumId=7"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">forum</a> on our site that you can use to ask questions. </p>
<h2 style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Update 2/2, Day 3</h2>

<h2 style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Introduction</h2>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Welcome to our Indiegogo.com campaign! We are EVV Games, a group of indie developers with a passion for games that want to expand the frontier of mobile gaming. This campaign started with our disappointment with the quality of Free-to-Play titles on the mobile market. To change that, we are working fervently on Airship Downs to bring you an innovative and quality-packed title that is geared around delivering gameplay. One of our goals is to bring Freedom to Free-to-Play. You will be able to enjoy an un-crippled Airship Downs experience without spending a penny.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">We are committed to communicating with you and taking your input in to full account as development progresses. For this, we are integrating an extensive player network at our site <a href=""http://www.airshipdowns.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.airshipdowns.com</a>. Please, reach out to us with your suggestions and concerns where your opinion can and will make a difference.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">By supporting our campaign, you can help us develop our unique title to the fullest of its potential and deliver it as soon as possible, which is currently set for August, '13. We are confident that Airship Downs can not only push the limits of mobile gaming, but of city-building simulators as a whole. Along with release on iOS and Android mobile devices, we are also expanding Airship Downs to other platforms including the Ouya and web browser.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""> <img alt=""Mock up of hoodies with logo"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8061/8239811471_c80e27cc9e_c.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Hoodie""/></p>
<h2 style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Types of play</h2>
<h3 style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Single Player</h3>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">The single player mode will be what you spend the majority of your time with. The main part of this will be the city building. This portion will start you with a cache of stores, and you will start off with building housing and resource collectors to begin building the city.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Each building will have its own storage. The food will essentially be stored as a whole, and will feed the city based on the demand. This will essentially be gathered and parsed out in the background automatically.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">The populace will gather food after building and occupying farms, fisheries, and hunting grounds and it will sustain the population. Initially, you start with four people in the population, one Player Character (PC) and three Non-Player Characters (NPCs). These people will all need housing in order to be able to be assigned to buildings. Once the housing is built for all four characters, they will occupy the initial buildings. From here you will be able to utilize the resources and begin creating your city!</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">The combat that takes place in the quest line and in the main game will be determined by whether you have selected the extended combat mode to be enabled. If not, you will still have all the standard battle capabilities; however, there will be some changes. You will have no military to maintain and will only receive units on an as needed basis with the option to auto-play the combat. At the end of battles you will receive rewards of gold, xp, crafting items, and more.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><img alt=""Barnubus"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8069/8188698087_480eb609a2_c.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Barnubus""/></p>
<h3 style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Cooperative</h3>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">You will be able to build a cooperative network with your contacts which will allow you to take advantage of several features. You will be able to interact with each others cities by assisting your contact in collecting rewards and reloading shop recipes. In addition, you will be provided with standard and premium currency that you can send to your player network contacts. Interaction with your contacts will also be streamlined and user-friendly within the network.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">If the extended combat is enabled, the cooperative mode will allow two players to join one screen, with one maintaining control, and the other viewing. Once a battle is engaged, the standard battle screen will pop up, and each player will be given a turn to place their units and enjoy the tactical gameplay together.</p>
<h3 style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Player vs. Player</h3>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">PvP will also be available if the extended combat is enabled. The rewards from combat will be in the form of a point system, and you will be able to accrue these points in order to purchase rewards specific to the extended combat mode.</p>
<h3 style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Player Network</h3>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">The player network will allow you to have access to an initial three game slots (which can be expanded), which you can use to store different game saves. This data will be accessible from whichever platform you decide to play the game on at any time.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Another beneficial feature included with your network will be a purchase tracking and reward system. Any players who decide to purchase premium content will not be overlooked. We will have a tiered discount system to reward those who spend on the title.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""> <img alt=""Clara Bust"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8481/8188704073_3a0307feed_h.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Clara""/></p>
<h3 style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Gameplay</h3>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">First, Airship Downs will include some of the standard gameplay that has always existed in city builders, as well as some of the newer good features. You will gather resources from the resource collectors, and these will be used to build your buildings and fuel your shops. The shops will make items, based on timed recipes, and return rewards in the form of coins and experience. The gold will help you purchase more items, such as decorations and building upgrades, and the experience will help you gain levels. As you gain levels, you will unlock new buildings, enhancements, decorations, and more.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">There will also be the “Creature Keeper” element, in the form of city Automatons. One of the special buildings will be the Automaton Workshop, which will take resources and coin to produce an Automaton. There will be at least three levels of rarity that can be produced with one recipe, and the resulting automaton will affect the city as a whole, a building that it occupies, or both.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Some of the differences will start in how you can setup your game. There will be many optional gameplay elements available to you as you learn more about the game, or for more experienced gamers. Once you join the player network, you will be given three game slots to play from and save to, so you will be able to have multiple different gameplay setups. The optional elements will be the technology web/pyramid and turn-based strategic combat. If you select the optional combat you will be able to opt for the dungeon crawling element and the “Death” mode, which will be a more difficult all or nothing style of play.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Our premium currency system will be generous in comparison to those from some developers, and more along the lines of what has traditionally been done. For example, most buildings will have a premium version which will produce rewards better than the normal version. Once a new version of this buidling, let's say a metal shop, is available, this upgraded metal shop will have rewards at least as good as the previous premium version of the metal shop. In order to make sure that you don't feel slighted by this new building, you will be able to downgrade the previous premium version of the metal shop back into the normal one. When downgrading, you will receive a percentage of your premium currency back, and then be able to upgrade to the newer and better normal metal shop, using standard currency. Of course you will also have the option to upgrade to the new premium version, at a discounted rate. The items and features available through premium currency will essentially save you some time, but will not effect the gameplay to an extensive degree.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><img alt=""Overhead Map"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8203/8234195424_0ed351856d_b.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">The city that you will be able to create in Airship Downs will truly be a reflection of how you want to play the game. This will be done through what you can build in your city. There will be a wealth of decorations that can be used to either enhance other buildings or just make your city look the way you want it to. There will also be a class of buildings that will allow you to create landmarks for your achievements, which will enhance large parts of your city or produce currency and/or experience. The shops themselves will be a way to define the way you want your city to work. The three main resources used to supply your shops will be metals, wood, and stone. Each of these three shop types will give rewards, which will be either balanced, currency favored, or experience favored. The shops will also be able to be modified, in order to fine tune the rewards. Along with the decorations that will be available to enhance your shops, you will truly be able to build your city exactly how you want it. In addition, all buildings will be able to be upgraded in order to keep up with your level advancement.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">One of the best optional features will be the technology web or pyramid. This is going to be entirely different from the static and linear technology tree, which was awesome in it's day, but we feel it is time for something a little more dynamic. This tech web will essentially consist of four different main specialties, which will be arms, ciphering, cultivation, and mechanization. Arms will center around hand tools and items that will increase efficiency on an individual scale, and mechanization will be it's opposite, increasing efficiency in a broader sense.<br/><br/>Of course, they will also have effects for the military players, which will coincide with the obvious purposes. The cultivation discipline will allow you to concentrate on the cultivation of both food and xp, while the ciphering path will grant better savvy with gold from the various possible income sources and the resource market. Each of these disciplines will also be connected to each of the other three, which will provide paths for them to come together. These will become more of a combination between the first two and will then work inward toward the other two.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.williamsayerjr.com/Images/shared/Ursa_Major_bear4a.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/>A good way to visualize this is to draw a square and connect the diagonals. Then picture one diagonal creating a triangular base with the two connected sides, and the remaining lines form into the apex of a triangular pyramid. Once you see this, you will see the four triangular faces of the pyramid, which will allow all four disciplines to connect to each other equally. Hopefully this helps to explain why this will be the tech ""web"".<br/><br/>The learning on this will consist of being able to spend points in each of the technologies you want for your city, with these points being earned every time your city gains a level. You will be able to spend multiple points in the technologies, with the only limitation being that you will need a certain amount of points (starting with just one for the edge skills) in a connecting technology. As you work inward, you will need a higher level of points the further you go. Another limiting factor will be that you will never be able to learn everything in the pyramid, which will mean that you will have to decide a path. This will also allow you to start another city and explore the avenues that you think will work the best.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">The optional combat will also help to further define this game as unique. While you are in your city, or traveling to other areas via the overhead map, you will find “hotspots” that have enemies ready to be engaged. Once you engage them, you will place your units on the grid, and then engage the enemy. You will be able to use each of your units as they are available, so will conceivable be able to use more than one unit per turn. The grid will be a square “star” grid, so it will allow for 8 directions of aiming and movement, but will also allow for some units to be larger than just one square.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">If you do not choose the optional combat, you will still be able to engage enemies, you will just have your units provided on an as needed basis. You will also have the option to “auto-battle” so you can just watch the AI determine the outcome while you watch.</p>
<h2 style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">What we need, and where we are</h2>
<p>Essentially, you will help us bring this team together, and from a group of 12 volunteers, a professional game development company will be formed.  The LLC Ex Vortex Vita has already been formed in Monroe, GA, and is the entity that will be receiving these funds.  The funds received here will allow everyone on this team to work at least full-time on this game for at least a couple of months.  We will also utilize some of the funding to enhance our team by hiring professional consults in a few areas that we are still weak in.  Another part of the funding, about $3k-$5k, will allow our founder to fly around and seek further funding from investors.  It will also allow us to purchase the software licenses that we need.  You can help EVV Games become a true force in the Indie Game Developer industry, and we will then bring this spectacular title to your mobile devices.</p>
<p>We are currently in the prototyping stage of development.  We have been building our asset pool (in-game items/objects), and building the framework within the game engine.  If you care to check out the engine we are using, it is <a href=""http://www.stonetrip.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Shiva 3D</a>.  We already have the main storyline well established, a first completion of the game design document, and are now working on more models for the buildings and the UI design.  We know you will like this game, so we will make this happen.</p>
<h2 style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""> </h2>
<h2 style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">The Impact</h2>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">For whatever reason, some developers think you are content with the stagnant, unoriginal state of the industry. By contributing to our campaign, you will be doing more than helping a single game and studio.  A contribution to this game is a contribution to the revolution in the air, to break the monopoly that major publishers have and give people the games they want. Even if you can't contribute, or haven't decided to yet, please help us get the word about this project out.  Chances are you or someone you knows plays a mobile video game or two, and anyone who has played any knows how much pressure is made to spend money on those games.  Help us do away with this common practice!  Thank you so much for your time to read this and hear us out, and we look forward to seeing you on the site!</p>

We are down to just under 3 days left in the campaign and while it looks unlikely that we will reach our goal, you can still help us finish strong.  We have decided that everyone who contributes to this campaign will automatically be bumped up a reward tier in regard to the digital content and in game credit.  There is still time to get the word out about this game and what we are trying to do for mobile games in general, so please help us in whatever ways you can!
Update 2/25, Day 25
We have uploaded a new video showing the successful testing of importing an animated character into the game engine.  With the engine being on the newer side it took some effort, but our talented team was able to sort through it.  Take a look here.
Update 2/22, Day 22
We have just over a week to go, and we are still hoping to get closer to our goal.  We have uploaded another video, showing the animation of one of our models, Barnubus no less, from the game engine.  Please check it out here.
Also, just to reiterate the fact that this will not be more of the same for mobile, here are a few highlights.

Airship Downs will allow up to three games to be played at the same time using our player network
It will be extremely replayable, and will allow players to add more of the optional features as they learn how to play
The amount of content and features included will easily make this game worthy of a PC title, but we want to bring it to mobile devices
This truly will not be more of the same, so if you want to see more game brought to your mobile devices, please support us today!
Update 2/15, Day 15
We are halfway through the campaign, and haven't quite reached it to the halfway mark yet, but that's OK!  We know that mobile video game players are ready for more game than what is currently out there, and we are still making headway on the project. 
We have chosen the option on our campaign, which will allow us to recieve most of the funds collected, REGARDLESS of whether or not we make the goal.  Every dollar will help us out folks, so please help us by contributing or spreading the word.
The time for a mobile video game revolution will soon be upon us, and you can be a part of that now!!
Update 2/8, Day 9
We have uploaded some footage from the city building portion of the game.  We are now working on the UI, so should have something cleaner within a week or so.  Also, don't be discouraged by the goal amoun, every little bit will help us get to the next stage of funding. 
Update 2/6, Day 7
Don't give up on us yet folks, because we haven't given up on you!  We are working on getting some gameplay footage up within the next day, so stay tuned.  And don't forget that we have a forum on our site that you can use to ask questions. 
Update 2/2, Day 3
Added ""What we need, and where we are"" section during the closing.
Update 2/1, Day 2
Added gameplay section to clarify gameplay and differences compared to current mobile city builders.
A BIG SHOUT OUT!! to those of you who have already contributed.  We greatly appreciate it!!
Here is a compilation from our audio team to listen to while you read.

Introduction
Welcome to our Indiegogo.com campaign! We are EVV Games, a group of indie developers with a passion for games that want to expand the frontier of mobile gaming. This campaign started with our disappointment with the quality of Free-to-Play titles on the mobile market. To change that, we are working fervently on Airship Downs to bring you an innovative and quality-packed title that is geared around delivering gameplay. One of our goals is to bring Freedom to Free-to-Play. You will be able to enjoy an un-crippled Airship Downs experience without spending a penny.
We are committed to communicating with you and taking your input in to full account as development progresses. For this, we are integrating an extensive player network at our site www.airshipdowns.com. Please, reach out to us with your suggestions and concerns where your opinion can and will make a difference.
By supporting our campaign, you can help us develop our unique title to the fullest of its potential and deliver it as soon as possible, which is currently set for August, '13. We are confident that Airship Downs can not only push the limits of mobile gaming, but of city-building simulators as a whole. Along with release on iOS and Android mobile devices, we are also expanding Airship Downs to other platforms including the Ouya and web browser.
 
Types of play
Single Player
The single player mode will be what you spend the majority of your time with. The main part of this will be the city building. This portion will start you with a cache of stores, and you will start off with building housing and resource collectors to begin building the city.
Each building will have its own storage. The food will essentially be stored as a whole, and will feed the city based on the demand. This will essentially be gathered and parsed out in the background automatically.
The populace will gather food after building and occupying farms, fisheries, and hunting grounds and it will sustain the population. Initially, you start with four people in the population, one Player Character (PC) and three Non-Player Characters (NPCs). These people will all need housing in order to be able to be assigned to buildings. Once the housing is built for all four characters, they will occupy the initial buildings. From here you will be able to utilize the resources and begin creating your city!
The combat that takes place in the quest line and in the main game will be determined by whether you have selected the extended combat mode to be enabled. If not, you will still have all the standard battle capabilities; however, there will be some changes. You will have no military to maintain and will only receive units on an as needed basis with the option to auto-play the combat. At the end of battles you will receive rewards of gold, xp, crafting items, and more.

Cooperative
You will be able to build a cooperative network with your contacts which will allow you to take advantage of several features. You will be able to interact with each others cities by assisting your contact in collecting rewards and reloading shop recipes. In addition, you will be provided with standard and premium currency that you can send to your player network contacts. Interaction with your contacts will also be streamlined and user-friendly within the network.
If the extended combat is enabled, the cooperative mode will allow two players to join one screen, with one maintaining control, and the other viewing. Once a battle is engaged, the standard battle screen will pop up, and each player will be given a turn to place their units and enjoy the tactical gameplay together.
Player vs. Player
PvP will also be available if the extended combat is enabled. The rewards from combat will be in the form of a point system, and you will be able to accrue these points in order to purchase rewards specific to the extended combat mode.
Player Network
The player network will allow you to have access to an initial three game slots (which can be expanded), which you can use to store different game saves. This data will be accessible from whichever platform you decide to play the game on at any time.
Another beneficial feature included with your network will be a purchase tracking and reward system. Any players who decide to purchase premium content will not be overlooked. We will have a tiered discount system to reward those who spend on the title.
 
Gameplay
First, Airship Downs will include some of the standard gameplay that has always existed in city builders, as well as some of the newer good features. You will gather resources from the resource collectors, and these will be used to build your buildings and fuel your shops. The shops will make items, based on timed recipes, and return rewards in the form of coins and experience. The gold will help you purchase more items, such as decorations and building upgrades, and the experience will help you gain levels. As you gain levels, you will unlock new buildings, enhancements, decorations, and more.
There will also be the “Creature Keeper” element, in the form of city Automatons. One of the special buildings will be the Automaton Workshop, which will take resources and coin to produce an Automaton. There will be at least three levels of rarity that can be produced with one recipe, and the resulting automaton will affect the city as a whole, a building that it occupies, or both.
Some of the differences will start in how you can setup your game. There will be many optional gameplay elements available to you as you learn more about the game, or for more experienced gamers. Once you join the player network, you will be given three game slots to play from and save to, so you will be able to have multiple different gameplay setups. The optional elements will be the technology web/pyramid and turn-based strategic combat. If you select the optional combat you will be able to opt for the dungeon crawling element and the “Death” mode, which will be a more difficult all or nothing style of play.
Our premium currency system will be generous in comparison to those from some developers, and more along the lines of what has traditionally been done. For example, most buildings will have a premium version which will produce rewards better than the normal version. Once a new version of this buidling, let's say a metal shop, is available, this upgraded metal shop will have rewards at least as good as the previous premium version of the metal shop. In order to make sure that you don't feel slighted by this new building, you will be able to downgrade the previous premium version of the metal shop back into the normal one. When downgrading, you will receive a percentage of your premium currency back, and then be able to upgrade to the newer and better normal metal shop, using standard currency. Of course you will also have the option to upgrade to the new premium version, at a discounted rate. The items and features available through premium currency will essentially save you some time, but will not effect the gameplay to an extensive degree.

The city that you will be able to create in Airship Downs will truly be a reflection of how you want to play the game. This will be done through what you can build in your city. There will be a wealth of decorations that can be used to either enhance other buildings or just make your city look the way you want it to. There will also be a class of buildings that will allow you to create landmarks for your achievements, which will enhance large parts of your city or produce currency and/or experience. The shops themselves will be a way to define the way you want your city to work. The three main resources used to supply your shops will be metals, wood, and stone. Each of these three shop types will give rewards, which will be either balanced, currency favored, or experience favored. The shops will also be able to be modified, in order to fine tune the rewards. Along with the decorations that will be available to enhance your shops, you will truly be able to build your city exactly how you want it. In addition, all buildings will be able to be upgraded in order to keep up with your level advancement.
One of the best optional features will be the technology web or pyramid. This is going to be entirely different from the static and linear technology tree, which was awesome in it's day, but we feel it is time for something a little more dynamic. This tech web will essentially consist of four different main specialties, which will be arms, ciphering, cultivation, and mechanization. Arms will center around hand tools and items that will increase efficiency on an individual scale, and mechanization will be it's opposite, increasing efficiency in a broader sense.Of course, they will also have effects for the military players, which will coincide with the obvious purposes. The cultivation discipline will allow you to concentrate on the cultivation of both food and xp, while the ciphering path will grant better savvy with gold from the various possible income sources and the resource market.

What we need, and where we are

<h3>About us:</h3>
<p>My name is Charles, also known as Vellusian. I'm the owner and administrator of a small, 20-person Minecraft bukkit server. We've been operational for over ten months now and it's starting to show. Our worlds and plugins have expanded over the months to the point that my locally hosted server cannot keep up with demand. It's our hope to raise enough money to get a box dedicated to the server that has more processing power and RAM to feed our growing needs.</p>
<p><font color=""#000000"" size=""5""><span style=""letter-spacing: 1.440000057220459px; line-height: 30px;""><b>Here's the plan:</b></span></font></p>
<p>Here's how I'm planning on on spending the money if we manage to reach our goals.</p>
<p>Of the $500 of the starting goal, ~$40 will be expenses of the campaign, since the platform takes a cut. </p>
<p>My current build that I have in mind is in the link below.</p>
<p><a href=""https://secure.newegg.com/WishList/MySavedWishDetail.aspx?ID=23239652"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://secure.newegg.com/WishList/PublicWishDetail.aspx?WishListNumber=23239652"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://secure.newegg.com/WishList/PublicWishDetail.aspx?WishListNumber=23239652</a><br/></p>
<p>If we manage to surpass our goal, I have several stretch goals in mind.</p>
<p>For $150 more ($650) total, I'll double the total RAM making a server with 32 GB.</p>
<p>At $750, I'll switch to a Phenom chip with a higher cache and the case/power supply will be swapped out with one with more fans and watts.</p>
<p>At $850, I'll look into getting a higher performance modem to see if opening up that choke will decrease latency and any dropped packets.</p>
<p>If we go higher than that, I'll have to come up with something else. <b>We can make this happen!</b></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>In exchange:</h3>
<div>I promise that the resulting machine will be used for the server and related tasks.</div>
<div>For your donation, as shown elsewhere on this page, we will build a Donor's Hall, with your name immortalized in the Overworld of the server.</div>
<div>Every level of donation gets credits to use in a planned in-game shop. These can also be obtained from in-game tasks.</div>
<div>At the Gold level, you have the option to append [VIP] as an additional suffix to your name. This tag is updated to [Elite] for an Emerald level donation. These tags are optional.</div>
<div>Curated nicknames are available with a Diamond level or higher donation. These nicknames are changed by server staff and cannot create confusion between players (i.e. using a name similar to another player's or appearing in staff colors).

My name is Charles, also known as Vellusian. I'm the owner and administrator of a small, 20-person Minecraft bukkit server. We've been operational for over ten months now and it's starting to show. Our worlds and plugins have expanded over the months to the point that my locally hosted server cannot keep up with demand. It's our hope to raise enough money to get a box dedicated to the server that has more processing power and RAM to feed our growing needs.
Here's the plan:
Here's how I'm planning on on spending the money if we manage to reach our goals.
Of the $500 of the starting goal, ~$40 will be expenses of the campaign, since the platform takes a cut. 
My current build that I have in mind is in the link below.
http://secure.newegg.com/WishList/PublicWishDetail.aspx?WishListNumber=23239652
If we manage to surpass our goal, I have several stretch goals in mind.
For $150 more ($650) total, I'll double the total RAM making a server with 32 GB.
At $750, I'll switch to a Phenom chip with a higher cache and the case/power supply will be swapped out with one with more fans and watts.
At $850, I'll look into getting a higher performance modem to see if opening up that choke will decrease latency and any dropped packets.
If we go higher than that, I'll have to come up with something else. We can make this happen!


In exchange:
I promise that the resulting machine will be used for the server and related tasks.
For your donation, as shown elsewhere on this page, we will build a Donor's Hall, with your name immortalized in the Overworld of the server.
Every level of donation gets credits to use in a planned in-game shop. These can also be obtained from in-game tasks.
At the Gold level, you have the option to append [VIP] as an additional suffix to your name. This tag is updated to [Elite] for an Emerald level donation. These tags are optional.
Curated nicknames are available with a Diamond level or higher donation. These nicknames are changed by server staff and cannot create confusion between players (i.e. using a name similar to another player's or appearing in staff colors). These are limited in change, likely once a week, to enable staff members to play and deal with other situations.
What this means:
Quite simply, this expansion should reduce server lag, potentially allowing us to turn up the number of active chunks, increase our player cap, as well as enable further growth.
As the server administrator, I can confirm that the simple process of running the server takes all of the resources I can provide to it. We're limited to 1 GB of memory and 1 core of my processor; both of which are at max most of the time.

<h3>Welcome to the QuizComp Indiegogo Campaign!</h3>
<p><b><i>QuizComp</i></b> is set to be the<i> <b>first</b> </i>competitive quiz/trivia app that will support <b><i>thousands of players</i></b> competing in <b><i>real-time quizzes around the globe</i></b> and will include a <i><b>variety of interactive question formats</b></i>. Compete against players across the globe, against people of your league/level, and even contribute to your country's progress at the same time!<br/></p>
<p>We are very excited about this app and have already put it through a <b><i>scoping</i></b> and <b><i>prototyping</i></b> phase with one of <b><i>Australia's top app development</i><i> companies</i></b>, where we worked to refine the idea and plan the development phase. We also produced a prototype which top contributors will be able to view and discuss with us, including the full list of features that aren't disclosed here in the interests of IP protection. We are now inviting you to help this app reach its full potential during the development phase.</p>
<p>Our founder is currently completing his PhD and has always loved puzzles and quizzes of all kinds. However, when looking at all the quiz apps currently available on the market, we were disappointed to see that all the apps were lacking in various areas:<br/></p>
<p>The problems we found with currently available quiz apps: <br/></p>
<ol>
<li>They use outdated and obscure questions.</li>
<li>They do not have a realistic competitive feel.</li>
<li>They don't offer any reason to complete the quiz i.e. no sense of achievement, competition, leveling etc.</li>
<li>They are all single format questions e.g. the typical multiple choice trivia question with four options.</li>
<li>The questions are not interactive i.e. just press the answer and lock it in.</li>
<li>The apps that do have leaderboards require you to complete hundreds of quizzes to reach the top and require the download of third party software.</li>
</ol>
<p>Seeing all of these shortcomings, we saw the opportunity to develop an <b><i>ultimate quiz experience</i></b> for <b><i>casual gamers</i></b> and <b><i>hardcore quiz fans</i></b> alike.<br/></p>
<p>In particular, we are producing an entirely <b><i>new up-to-date question database</i></b> for the game, rather than simply purchasing an outdated database and this will include <b><i>interactive</i></b> questions of a <b><i>variety</i></b> of different formats. Follow our Facebook and Twitter pages to keep up to date and answer daily questions until the game is released!<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Development Costs<br/>
</h3>
<p>During the scoping and prototyping phase, an estimate of $40,000AUD was reached for an iOS (iPhone) build of this app. This is what has been estimated in order to achieve a world-class level app, including all of the core features. After all, nobody wants an app that is barely functional. This campaign has been listed at $45,000AUD to allow for any unforseen development costs that may arise and to build a website for the app.</p>
<p>If the campaign reaches ~$90,000 then an android build (estimated at $50,000) will begin development as well, as we would really love to see this game made available across as many current mobile devices as possible.</p>
<p>Any money raised above this will be used to build some of the extra features into the app that were put on hold to reach the more realistic cost of $40,000.<br/></p>
<p>If the goal of $45,000 is not reached, then we will work with the development team to scale back the build to fit within the budget, however this may severely impair the core concept so please show your support for this exciting app and help it to reach its full potential :-)<br/></p>

Recently, <a href=""http://www.patreon.com/horriblepeople"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">we've started a Patreon</a>, giving extra goodies and early access to all our patrons. They've been a wonderful help recouping expenses and giving us incentive to put more content out faster. </p><p>Despite putting the cards out for free, the cons we went to in 2013 proved to us that people don't want to just print out their own decks, but rather would prefer to grab-and-go with an official deck. If we make it to BronyCon, we can provide decks of our 1.0 version of the game to an unprecedented audience.</p><p>But of course we're not expecting pure altruism, and want to be able to make it worth your while for helping us.

That said, although we're covering the cost of card printing out-of-pocket, it's exceptionally steep! If we make above our main goal, we'll be able to reimburse ourselves for that and other important con-related costs!</p><p><b>Stretch Goal: Cover the Cost of Printing 100 Decks - $3500</b><br/>If we reach $3500, we will have covered the cost of printing 100 decks. We'll also spring for some basic reverse-top boxes and some sticker logos so it's not just a deck wrapped in cellophane!</p><p><b>Stretch Goal: Cover the Cost of Food - $3800</b><br/>If we reach $3800, that will cover the cost of feeding us for four days, plus any additional costs the extra money will incur in fees and taxes. All tiers will get a whole pack of TSSSF wallpapers (probably 5-8 or so?). </p><p><b>Stretch Goal: Cover the Cost of Printing 150 Decks - $4400</b><br/>If we reach $4400, the cost of printing 150 decks will be covered!

We will also spring for real, actual, designed and printed tuckboxes for each deck!</p><p><b>Stretch Goal: Cover All Con Costs (and taxes and fees) - $8000</b><br/>Since we covered the tuckboxes out of our own wallet and there are other things like new display materials etc, there's a final for-reals ultimate stretch goal. And that is to cover all our con costs this year! Which would be frankly amazing!! That would cover table costs for Everfree, BronyCon, AND BronyCAN; it would cover food and hotel costs for BronyCAN too. It would cover all the display equipment (wireframe cubes, vinyl sign, fancy shmancy tablecloth, etc) that we've already picked up. It would cover the new button punch, the business cards, as well as the cost of printing out all our prints and buttons, as well as the button supplies.<br/>Also, since pretty much every penny of this campaign has largely gone to printing costs etc, we'll still have to pay a hefty chunk of taxes on it later. We're not terribly worried, but it would be nice to not have to think about it too much!

Custom cards for everyone would need to observe very strict rules and a lot of guidance from us. If you want to make your card available separately, however, you are more than welcome to!<p></p><p><b>Q: When will I get my custom cards? Should I be sending you information now?</b><br/>A: Hold on tight! We're going to get your deck to you first. Then, once con season is over and we've had a moment to breathe, we'll send out surveys asking you for information on your cards. Once we've made them, we'll send you the PNG over email, and then once they've been printed we'll get your shipping information and send it to you in the mail. This should be, at the latest, April of next year but we'll keep you apprised!</p><p><b>Q: Can I buy the con-exclusive cards separately (at cons)?</b><br/>A: You absolutely can! We'll be selling them for $5 or free with purchase of a deck. If you pick up your Indiegogo deck there, you'll get the con exclusive for free AS WELL AS the Indiegogo exclusive. Lucky you!</p><p></p><p><b>Q: You said only people who pick their decks up at cons get the con-exclusive cards. Do people who donated $40 or higher and are getting their decks shipped still get the Maud Pie card?</b><br/>A: Absolutely!! The Maud Pie card is Indiegogo-exclusive, not con-exclusive. Everyone who donated for that card will get it, whether you pick it up or have it shipped.</p><p><b>Q: If someone else is picking up my deck for me at the con, do I still get the con exclusive card?</b><br/>A: Most definitely! And I'm sure Ruby appreciates not having to ship your deck!</p><p><b>Q: Wait, you can get a deck shipped to you if you're not going to a con?</b><br/>A: Indeedy! Donate as normal, drop a comment letting us know you need it shipped, and contact Ruby at rubyblossom@outlook.com!</p><p><b>Q: When will we get our decks shipped?</b><br/>A: Sometime after BronyCAN (which is at the end of August). We're going to be spending most of our time juggling the decks back and forth between cons and we have no idea how well or poorly they'll sell. (Well, we have an idea, but we don't want to pin our hopes too high.) After the con craziness is done, we'll order any extra decks we need to fulfill the orders and send them on their merry way!</p><p><b>Q: Can I increase my pledge for a higher tier?</b><br/>A: You can, although it's not as easy on Indiegogo as it is on Kickstarter. Simply pledge at the $1 tier and increase your pledge to the difference, and make sure to <a href=""http://support.indiegogo.com/hc/en-us/articles/526756-How-to-Upgrade-Your-Perk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">answer our survey with your correct tier</a>. (For more information, <a href=""http://support.indiegogo.com/hc/en-us/articles/526756-How-to-Upgrade-Your-Perk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">see this page</a>.)</p><p><b>Q: Can I get my friends to buy the con exclusive cards for me? </b><br/>A: Yes, of course! Though please note that all customers are limited to 2 exclusives and 2 decks per con. (Purchasing exclusives for someone else counts against your limit; so does buying a deck for someone who hasn't yet gotten one. However, picking up a deck for someone who's already donated DOES NOT count against your limit.)</p><p><b>Q: Can I pay you ahead of time for the exclusive cards my friends will be picking up?</b><br/>A: Alas, no! That would mean more book-keeping on our part and it increases the likelihood we won't be able to keep track of additional purchases and lose your purchase and basically things just get a little crazy. Just give the money to your friends and have them buy 'em up. That would be the best way.

<p></p></div>","UPDATE 6/23/14: When you are done donating, BE SURE TO FILL OUT THIS SURVEY. Otherwise you WILL NOT get your rewards! For those of you having decks shipped to you, Ruby will handle gathering your addresses LATER, after she has the decks in hand. See Updates for further details on timing.UPDATE, 6/20/14: If you are not going to a convention, never fear! Someone has opted to arrange for shipping decks to folks. Please read the Important Note down there, below, for more information. All the way down. Kay thanks!UPDATE, 6/11/14: Welcome folks from Equestria Daily! Heads up! The official 1.0 version of the PDF will not be released until Sunday June 15th so don't go printing v0.10.0 early! I'd hate for you all to waste ink like that, haha. Either way, hello! Hi! Welcome! If you don't have any local friends to play with, never fear! We have a Vassal module that lets you play online with your friends! -- End Update --Greetings, fellow horrible people! We are Horrible People Studios, and we want to bring our horrible games to BronyCon! One of the things that has floored us and made us feel Oh So Special is the huge positive response our flagship game, Twilight Sparkle's Secret Shipfic Folder, has received at previous cons, and we want to bring more joy to the East Coasters this year.However, seeing as we're based in Seattle, a trip to Baltimore can get very expensive, along with all the other fees and costs that go along with it. You can see our cost breakdown in the infographic below. Long story short, we're looking to raise $2200 to get to BronyCon this year, and we need your help.For those who may not be familiar with TSSSF, here's the elevator pitch: Twilight Sparkle is Equestria's most prolific (and horrific) fan fiction author. She ships herself, her friends, her family, and her enemies in a labyrinthine mess of OTPs with complete disregard for familial relation, sexual orientation, and harmonious mane/coat color combination. You play as part of her twisted psyche, building up a ""shipping grid"" of pairings using the cards from your hand, attempting to achieve goal points so you can prove yourself the Queen of the Ships.It features 162 full-color cards, all uniquely illustrated by Pixel Prism!Rated PG.TSSSF has been a labor of love for the three of us since we conceived of it back in Season 2. Since the beginning, we've provided access to the cards completely free of charge via our website. Recently, we've started a Patreon, giving extra goodies and early access to all our patrons. They've been a wonderful help recouping expenses and giving us incentive to put more content out faster. Despite putting the cards out for free, the cons we went to in 2013 proved to us that people don't want to just print out their own decks, but rather would prefer to grab-and-go with an official deck. If we make it to BronyCon, we can provide decks of our 1.0 version of the game to an unprecedented audience.But of course we're not expecting pure altruism, and want to be able to make it worth your while for helping us. We have a number of lovely incentives to give to anyone willing to help us out.All tiers now get the wallpaper pack and a very short story!Note: Decks will be selling for $30 at conventions!Stretch GoalsThis indiegogo, at its heart, is ONLY to help us get to BronyCon in August. That said, although we're covering the cost of card printing out-of-pocket, it's exceptionally steep! If we make above our main goal, we'll be able to reimburse ourselves for that and other important con-related costs!Stretch Goal: Cover the Cost of Printing 100 Decks - $3500If we reach $3500, we will have covered the cost of printing 100 decks. We'll also spring for some basic reverse-top boxes and some sticker logos so it's not just a deck wrapped in cellophane!Stretch Goal: Cover the Cost of Food - $3800If we reach $3800, that will cover the cost of feeding us for four days, plus any additional costs the extra money will incur in fees and taxes. All tiers will get a whole pack of TSSSF wallpapers (probably 5-8 or so?). Stretch Goal: Cover the Cost of Printing 150 Decks - $4400If we reach $4400, the cost of printing 150 decks will be covered! All tiers get drabbles -- basically short fanfic snippets Twilight will write just for you!Stretch Goal: Cover the Cost of Printing 300 Decks - $6100If we reach $6100, we'll cover the cost of printing 300 decks! We will also spring for real, actual, designed and printed tuckboxes for each deck!Stretch Goal: Cover All Con Costs (and taxes and fees) - $8000Since we covered the tuckboxes out of our own wallet and there are other things like new display materials etc, there's a final for-reals ultimate stretch goal. And that is to cover all our con costs this year! Which would be frankly amazing!! That would cover table costs for Everfree, BronyCon, AND BronyCAN; it would cover food and hotel costs for BronyCAN too. It would cover all the display equipment (wireframe cubes, vinyl sign, fancy shmancy tablecloth, etc) that we've already picked up. It would cover the new button punch, the business cards, as well as the cost of printing out all our prints and buttons, as well as the button supplies.Also, since pretty much every penny of this campaign has largely gone to printing costs etc, we'll still have to pay a hefty chunk of taxes on it later. We're not terribly worried, but it would be nice to not have to think about it too much! Also this will probably pay for an accountant because good gosh.Anything above this will go back into our coffers to start a con fund!Important Notes About DecksIf you purchase an incentive that includes a deck, we will set a deck aside just for you to pick up at BronyCon, BronyCAN, or possibly EverfreeNW*. Someone has offered to gather up and ship decks to folks who can't make conventions. You are welcome to take this option! If so, 1) Please note that you will ALSO have to pay shipping costs. 2) Donate here as per usual, then drop a comment here to let us know you need your deck shipped to you. 3) Then email Ruby at rubyblossom(a)outlook.com. 4) Ruby will not be working on coordinating all of this until the decks are in hand after Everfree, so just sit tight after that! They will be sending out a Google Form survey to get all your details at the appropriate time.IMPORTANT NOTE: Please check the USPS.com Shipping Calculator for your region, for a package weighing 2lbs. You will be shouldering that cost! So please decide if that's worth the cost before you donate. Ruby's happy to accommodate you!IMPORTANT NOTE II: SON OF IMPORTANT NOTE: When you've donated, please answer our very short survey so we know where our decks are going!FAQQ: Are the custom cards standard in everyone's decks or are they just mine?A: They're just yours! Custom cards for everyone would need to observe very strict rules and a lot of guidance from us. If you want to make your card available separately, however, you are more than welcome to!Q: When will I get my custom cards? Should I be sending you information now?A: Hold on tight! We're going to get your deck to you first. Then, once con season is over and we've had a moment to breathe, we'll send out surveys asking you for information on your cards. Once we've made them, we'll send you the PNG over email, and then once they've been printed we'll get your shipping information and send it to you in the mail. This should be, at the latest, April of next year but we'll keep you apprised!Q: Can I buy the con-exclusive cards separately (at cons)?A: You absolutely can! We'll be selling them for $5 or free with purchase of a deck. If you pick up your Indiegogo deck there, you'll get the con exclusive for free AS WELL AS the Indiegogo exclusive. Lucky you!Q: You said only people who pick their decks up at cons get the con-exclusive cards. Do people who donated $40 or higher and are getting their decks shipped still get the Maud Pie card?A: Absolutely!! The Maud Pie card is Indiegogo-exclusive, not con-exclusive. Everyone who donated for that card will get it, whether you pick it up or have it shipped.Q: If someone else is picking up my deck for me at the con, do I still get the con exclusive card?A: Most definitely! And I'm sure Ruby appreciates not having to ship your deck!Q: Wait, you can get a deck shipped to you if you're not going to a con?A: Indeedy! Donate as normal, drop a comment letting us know you need it shipped, and contact Ruby at rubyblossom@outlook.com!Q: When will we get our decks shipped?A: Sometime after BronyCAN (which is at the end of August). We're going to be spending most of our time juggling the decks back and forth between cons and we have no idea how well or poorly they'll sell. (Well, we have an idea, but we don't want to pin our hopes too high.) After the con craziness is done, we'll order any extra decks we need to fulfill the orders and send them on their merry way!Q: Can I increase my pledge for a higher tier?A: You can, although it's not as easy on Indiegogo as it is on Kickstarter. Simply pledge at the $1 tier and increase your pledge to the difference, and make sure to answer our survey with your correct tier. (For more information, see this page.)Q: Can I get my friends to buy the con exclusive cards for me? A: Yes, of course! Though please note that all customers are limited to 2 exclusives and 2 decks per con. (Purchasing exclusives for someone else counts against your limit; so does buying a deck for someone who hasn't yet gotten one. However, picking up a deck for someone who's already donated DOES NOT count against your limit.)Q: Can I pay you ahead of time for the exclusive cards my friends will be picking up?A: Alas, no! That would mean more book-keeping on our part and it increases the likelihood we won't be able to keep track of additional purchases and lose your purchase and basically things just get a little crazy. Just give the money to your friends and have them buy 'em up. That would be the best way.

<br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Dawn of the evil is rpg game with the elements of action, mystics, and hardcore-fight as we mentioned before. We started this process because we are players, or more exactly gamers, and we really know what the real gamers need. Sometimes gamers need not only some action but the kknowledgethat’s why we take so much attention to history and metaphysics in our game. Our slogan is<b> <i>‘A Human, not a Hero’</i></b> and we try to proof this statement at each and every step of our working process. Thus, hero doesn't have special super-natural abilities as 90% of the characters and what is more important he will have to struggle with everything around - people, own superstitions, monsters, authorities… overall he will have to become strong first (train his spirit), and only then powerful. </p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><b><i>Overall,  because our slogan is ‘A Human, not a Hero’ it means our protagonist will not be unique with superhuman abilities- he'll have to live as ''surfer of fate lines', i.e. not struggling with life and people, but following the ways of life remembering about butterfly effect - this will make the player and his character as one. Our player will live and grow with the protagonist.</i></b></span><br/></p>

<br/><p>As we go we’re making the process of the game creation and each stage completion as transparent as only we can. However we do not reveal the complete scenario of our game for the known reason. We start sharing the facts about our game on our Social pages as we went. </p>
<br/><p>In the meantime you can see most of the fact about our game on our Social pages and <a href=""http://dawnevil.eu/Home/About"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">on our site</a>. We either shared these facts or answered in form of F.A.Q.</p>
<p>*The actions of the first chapter will take place in 540 BC.</p>
<p>*The genre of our game is Action-Rpg and there will be with the elements of hardcore-fight, role-play, adventure and action games.</p>
<p> *We mixed up the apocalyptic legends, ancient Greek and Bible legends. And not only them actually. One of the co-founders wrote a manuscript called “Metaphysics” where he tried to combine Assyrian, Greek, ancient Hebrew and all Near-East legends to find a parallel between them.  We want our players dive into the true ancient worlds and live with the beliefs and superstitions of those epochs. </p>
<p>*Our hero is not a super-man – and this is another secret we can tell. Also some of the non-playable characters can just refuse to do some actions so our hero will have to face really hard time to achieve his goals and complete his mission. In other words, some missions may be very tricky and bring you more adventures than you have expected. Also our sociability is mirrored in our game as the hero will need to try to earn the trustworthy among npc-characters. </p>
<p>*Each npc will live his or her own lives. The open world, nonlinear story and all the costumes + weapons are close to the ones people used to wear and use during those days. We keep working over the historical exactness to be very realistic.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">If we reach our goal we’ll be able to complete the process of location creation that will be shown in our next trailer. The location will be settled by the humans. The process of main characters creation will be finally completed. Also the first 3d models of the monsters will be completed too. And  if we achieve our goals the funded money may also help us to complete the prototype of the behavioral system as well. In the best case if the necessary money are crowdfunded all the mentioned processes will take us 3-4 month of hard working to complete.</span><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/884183/files/20140926065312-face.jpg?1411739592"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>The main motivation for this campaign is to introduce the new ancient style action-rpg with the realistic feeling of the past times and reveal many secrets of “how it works” process via social media. <br/><p></p> </div><div><br/></div><div>
<p><span><b>The goals we pursuit </b></span></p>
<br/><p>The first goal of our campaign is to gather money for 3d shooting and filming process that means we’ll need the new office with the professional equipment for the mentioned purposes. We would like to bring the brand new faces and appearances, rich mimics and emotions which is almost impossible without the special tools. Also we are supposed to be a social project and we would like to help young talents in Riga to start their careers with us. First of all, we need actors who will lend us their voices and emotions. Of course, many developers may want to see the faces of celebrities such as Shakira or young Brad Pitt and use them as prototypes in their games –  but joking aside we’re inventing the new game and we need to bring the game to the people next to us. Thus, filming sort of work won’t be possible without markers, cameras and other 3D equipment plus renting a place to shoot for the two year period.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/884305/files/20140926075336-new_stuff.jpg?1411743216"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>Now we created locations you see in the trailer, but they are nothing without settlers and characters, who are, in their turn, impossible to be 3d without the proper equipment. The scenario and concept-art are ready too. You can see some of this stuff here within the text, most of concept-art and location renders are available on our Social Network Sites. </p>
<p>The second goal is to start  with the 3D equipping. If you google for 3d scanners anywhere in specialized ecommerce stores (such as amazon) you will see how much the professional means really cost. We need about 20 cameras and 3d scanner not only for a face scanning process but also for capturing the necessary emotions and face mimics so that any character looks as natural as possible. The more professionally made the game, the more professional 3d equipment is. Needless to say the high-quality 3d equipment costs money. And also we’re always welcome the thirsty for learning IT individuals who would like to improve their experience with our game.</p>
<p>The third goal is to broadcast out our working process. Seriously. Many people do not believe in many game developers because they just do not know what they are really doing. On our social network pages we tried to make this process as transparent and clear as we could. The same thing is done for our site. However for this purpose we do not ask for money - we’ve done it at our own expenses… along with working out the locations, purchasing equipment for 3d-art. In comparison with the 3d equipment  for shooting process it costs nothing :).</p>
<p>And the goal number zero is to complete the four-month stage of developing process – when the basic level is reached, the system of health-n-sleep will be developed, the basic placements without sophisticated cities will be built, first monsters and main character become live and the faces you now see in concepts become lively with rich mimics!</p>
<br/>
</div><div><br/></div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p><span><b>What We Need</b></span></p>
<p>We’re not asking you for money to make the game. We are realistic about this process and we know that we need a good start first. So we divided the process of game development into proper stages. Thus, we are crowdfunding money for the start process – we need to create 3d  models, buy scanners and cameras and shoot a new trailer-video with characters to show what the final version of the game will look like. The equipment will help our team to complete the models of first monsters, characters, npcs, settle the locations you see in demo-video etc. And here are the figures we’ll try to achieve with IndieGogo:</p>

<h1><span>How your money is used</span></h1>
<br/><p>So we need to be clear about how money will be used. If we make exactly 70000€ or more it will help us to rent a new office, to set maximum equipment for 3d photo shooting, to complete first 4-month-stage process (pre-alpha) and to release the first official video trailer with the monsters and 3d faces of our characters. If this sum will be insignificantly more than planned the money will be spent on widening sets of supporting npc-characters.</p>
<p>If the sum of money raised will be significantly more than the necessary sum (150% and more) then money will be spent on widening of our developers  team to accelerate the process of final release of alpha, thus, alpha is released before September 2015.</p>
<p>To be more clear about our plans we need to say the quality of 3d scanner depends on the price. For instance, if we reach our minimum or less we will have nothing but to buy DAVID Structured Light 3D Scanner worth 3000+ euros with postage. It has minimal requirements for us to please our players with good graphics. However if we reach more than twice of the required sum  then we will be able to afford the Artec Eva 3D Scanner that costs 19000 euros with postage. The last scanner is good for the high-quality objects capture thus the detailed graphics of any object will be of premium quality. Also we will need a  set of 20 cameras, a virtual camera, a costume and hat for the further animation process. And this equipment is the minimum  requirements we needed to start 3d shooting for the game.</p>

<p></p>
<p>We will keep updating infographics about the budget reach to reflect the current status of the campaign so that all our donators could know what we’ve gathered and what goals of the list have been achieved.</p>
<br/><p></p>
<p><b>What You Get</b></p>
<br/><p>So what do our donators get out of it?  The concept of the company is not bad but  the big projects really need a big start whereas the donators need some kind of evidences of project existence and serious goals of the team. First of all, we will share the posters with any donator and that is not the question as we’ve already shared our pieces of art with the contest participants we organized on our Social pages. However more stuff as special club-cart or early alpha access will be available later on (estimated date of  alpha release - September 2015) .</p>
<p>If we get funds enough for renting the new office with 3d photoshoot equipment any donator will get the posters, art-books, manual books, T-shirts and bestiary stylized as our special game trend. This stuff will be the first to deliver as printable information based on the concept-art and as long as the concept-art is ready that won’t make you wait long (T-shirts and hi-res posters will be sent immediately once the money is crowdfunded)</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/884212/files/20140926071319-waterflow.jpg?1411740799"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>The VIP donators will be granted the special premium and platinum accounts that means some special missions will be made only for them and some tricks will be revealed during these missions. However we are realistic and we understand that the first steps are all about renting a good office here in Riga equipped with 3d shooting means  and completion process of 3d model creation.
</div><div>
<p>If you've paid for something physical (such as T-shirt, coins, pendants, printed posters etc), and you don't want to pick it up from the place we live, you will probably have to pay for the postage charges as well.</p>
<p>Europe: 10€/ <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Globally: 10€</span></p>
<p>But all the digital copies are free of charges and will be posted as we release each. The quickest delivery comes for the posters and calendars, definitely access to alpha is the longest stuff to wait. </p>
<p>Also the high-level donators will not have to pay extra postal charges as it will be at expense of our team.</p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p><span><b>A different type of Action-RPG</b></span></p>
<p>We are a different type of action-rpg genre. However we’re positioning ourselves as rpg with the elements of action and mix of other genres. When it comes to the top action-rpg games  hero can do unusual stuff and replace the whole armies using his extra abilities  but our hero will be a simple mortal thus he will have to sweat on the abilities and solve different tricky problems (as we previously mentioned he will have to come across unexpected deeds, actions and refusals by his partners). We would really love to let players feel how hard those times were and feel exactly like our hero does.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/884221/files/20140926071628-rill.jpg?1411740988"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>The story, as mentioned, is based on the ancient legends and some true historical events. You will be also able to see the true historical and legendary individuals throughout the game. There will be different female characters but the main female character will surprise you, we swear! You already see her unique appearance here in concept-art illustrations. We skipped the classy red hairs and green eyes you often see in many top games. We brought the new concepts of faces - we promised that. However now we need real people and equipment to make these characters real and lively, full of mimics and emotions.</p>
<p>A good introductory of the game is always a must and we are working on this process.  We will do our best to introduce the catchiest stuff! Also you will need to have some special  mystical abilities – yes, we still cannot do without them and archangels in the game will help you with that!</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/884233/files/20140926072039-wpp2.jpg?1411741239"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p></p>
<p>As long as we are in need of the pledges, the main character will be developed in real time. You will follow the process up in all our social networks &amp; on our site. Currently we’ve composed the costumes for the characters after spending time working with the true historical  fashion details. We are fans of history and legends so sometimes we know  the topic, sometimes we need to consult with the professionals. For instance, we needed to describe the steel-casting process in the game (scenario stage) and we found the professional who taught us master-class.</p>
<p>Both the beginners and masters of rpg, action and other genres will be interested in our game because the characters will be catchy, unique… sometimes too unique even Assyrian Gods will be there! And yes, there will be some unpredictable stuff as some solutions of the protagonist will not be liked by his partners (both of npc and the real players) – but he won’t be able to do otherwise – that is the point! Previously we mentioned that the hero will sometimes be refused to do something by his partners. And that means unpredictable stuff of the game will make you step over the usual steps you take while playing and try to find another solution.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/884269/files/20140926073940-wip2.jpg?1411742380"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p></p>
<p>Currently we are working on the digital manual however the readymade book will be available as the game is completed. But the access to the early Alpha is meant to have some prompts and guidances on how to complete this or that mission. Also we put the estimated delivery date as the datewhen Alpha is completed that is September 2015 (digital art will be delivered fater).</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/884229/files/20140926071930-marshlands.jpg?1411741170"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p></p>
<p>Our team is also working on the tricky algorithms that will really make your missions even more complicated. Thus, the protagonist will have to sweat on fight with monsters - he will need to find out the monster’s weak points.</p>
<p>Definitely there will be a social club for the players in a long run but now it’s not our highest priority. We’re frequently asked about social club and similar matters. Going to indiegogo is a best chance to answer FAQ about our game. You can use our site, Social pages, Youtube and other channels to ask questions.</p>
<p>Each step is tested by ourselves, our close friends and family members who are players themselves. And thus we base each step (starting with the grass on our landscapes and finishing up with the comfort of the hero’s costume) on the opinions from both inside and outside. Yes, the vip donators will be able to join this team and will be the first to test alpha with us! We are enjoying this process and we hope you will enjoy it too.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
<p><span>No crowdfunding campaign comes without risks, but we will try to minimize them.</span></p>
<p>The worst case scenario is if we cannot reach 70000 € our team won’t be completed and we won’t be able to rent an office with the special studio for 3d scanning process. But we will still have possibility to find sponsors here on our soils, however in that case it will take our players and fans waiting longer in comparison with the best case scenario.</p>
<p>But let's make sure it doesn't come to that and instead we are donated and we finally started the first 4-month process that will keep being broadcasted on our Social media Channels and the site!</p>

We would like to bring something really new into the world of RPG as we are a G2G  (Gamers2Gamers) company called Eastglade Entertainment.




Dawn of the evil is rpg game with the elements of action, mystics, and hardcore-fight as we mentioned before. We started this process because we are players, or more exactly gamers, and we really know what the real gamers need. Sometimes gamers need not only some action but the kknowledgethat’s why we take so much attention to history and metaphysics in our game. Our slogan is ‘A Human, not a Hero’ and we try to proof this statement at each and every step of our working process. Thus, hero doesn't have special super-natural abilities as 90% of the characters and what is more important he will have to struggle with everything around - people, own superstitions, monsters, authorities… overall he will have to become strong first (train his spirit), and only then powerful. 
Overall,  because our slogan is ‘A Human, not a Hero’ it means our protagonist will not be unique with superhuman abilities- he'll have to live as ''surfer of fate lines', i.e. not struggling with life and people, but following the ways of life remembering about butterfly effect - this will make the player and his character as one. Our player will live and grow with the protagonist.

As we go we’re making the process of the game creation and each stage completion as transparent as only we can. However we do not reveal the complete scenario of our game for the known reason. We start sharing the facts about our game on our Social pages as we went. 
In the meantime you can see most of the fact about our game on our Social pages and on our site. We either shared these facts or answered in form of F.A.Q.
*The actions of the first chapter will take place in 540 BC.
*The genre of our game is Action-Rpg and there will be with the elements of hardcore-fight, role-play, adventure and action games.
 *We mixed up the apocalyptic legends, ancient Greek and Bible legends. And not only them actually. One of the co-founders wrote a manuscript called “Metaphysics” where he tried to combine Assyrian, Greek, ancient Hebrew and all Near-East legends to find a parallel between them.  We want our players dive into the true ancient worlds and live with the beliefs and superstitions of those epochs. 
*Our hero is not a super-man – and this is another secret we can tell. Also some of the non-playable characters can just refuse to do some actions so our hero will have to face really hard time to achieve his goals and complete his mission. In other words, some missions may be very tricky and bring you more adventures than you have expected. Also our sociability is mirrored in our game as the hero will need to try to earn the trustworthy among npc-characters. 
*Each npc will live his or her own lives. The open world, nonlinear story and all the costumes + weapons are close to the ones people used to wear and use during those days. We keep working over the historical exactness to be very realistic.
If we reach our goal we’ll be able to complete the process of location creation that will be shown in our next trailer. The location will be settled by the humans. The process of main characters creation will be finally completed. Also the first 3d models of the monsters will be completed too. And  if we achieve our goals the funded money may also help us to complete the prototype of the behavioral system as well. In the best case if the necessary money are crowdfunded all the mentioned processes will take us 3-4 month of hard working to complete.

The main motivation for this campaign is to introduce the new ancient style action-rpg with the realistic feeling of the past times and reveal many secrets of “how it works” process via social media.  
The goals we pursuit 
The first goal of our campaign is to gather money for 3d shooting and filming process that means we’ll need the new office with the professional equipment for the mentioned purposes. We would like to bring the brand new faces and appearances, rich mimics and emotions which is almost impossible without the special tools. Also we are supposed to be a social project and we would like to help young talents in Riga to start their careers with us. First of all, we need actors who will lend us their voices and emotions. Of course, many developers may want to see the faces of celebrities such as Shakira or young Brad Pitt and use them as prototypes in their games –  but joking aside we’re inventing the new game and we need to bring the game to the people next to us. Thus, filming sort of work won’t be possible without markers, cameras and other 3D equipment plus renting a place to shoot for the two year period.  


Now we created locations you see in the trailer, but they are nothing without settlers and characters, who are, in their turn, impossible to be 3d without the proper equipment. The scenario and concept-art are ready too. You can see some of this stuff here within the text, most of concept-art and location renders are available on our Social Network Sites. 
The second goal is to start  with the 3D equipping. If you google for 3d scanners anywhere in specialized ecommerce stores (such as amazon) you will see how much the professional means really cost. We need about 20 cameras and 3d scanner not only for a face scanning process but also for capturing the necessary emotions and face mimics so that any character looks as natural as possible. The more professionally made the game, the more professional 3d equipment is. Needless to say the high-quality 3d equipment costs money. And also we’re always welcome the thirsty for learning IT individuals who would like to improve their experience with our game.
The third goal is to broadcast out our working process. Seriously. Many people do not believe in many game developers because they just do not know what they are really doing. On our social network pages we tried to make this process as transparent and clear as we could. The same thing is done for our site. However for this purpose we do not ask for money - we’ve done it at our own expenses… along with working out the locations, purchasing equipment for 3d-art. In comparison with the 3d equipment  for shooting process it costs nothing :).
And the goal number zero is to complete the four-month stage of developing process – when the basic level is reached, the system of health-n-sleep will be developed, the basic placements without sophisticated cities will be built, first monsters and main character become live and the faces you now see in concepts become lively with rich mimics!

  What We Need & What You Get 
What We Need
We’re not asking you for money to make the game. We are realistic about this process and we know that we need a good start first. So we divided the process of game development into proper stages. Thus, we are crowdfunding money for the start process – we need to create 3d  models, buy scanners and cameras and shoot a new trailer-video with characters to show what the final version of the game will look like. The equipment will help our team to complete the models of first monsters, characters, npcs, settle the locations you see in demo-video etc. And here are the figures we’ll try to achieve with IndieGogo:
45000 €  will help us to obtain the 3d scanner likeArctic Eva plus buy 20 cameras, a virtual camera, markers and 3 costumes for animation.  This equipment lets designers and 3d modelers to catch not only the appearance of the human-model but also to scan and remember the emotions and mimics of each face that will make any character look realistic. Thus the mentioned equipment will help to complete the creation of the main characters.
The sum of 10000€  will be needed to create 3d models of 3d non-human objects. Yes, we need to use 3d models of objects (not characters) like spiders, fish, wings… i.e. all non-human objects including the mystic objects that do not exist in our world.
We needed the sum of  15000€ to rent a new office with the special room for 3D shooting and scanning. 

Next, and this is where you come in, any of our donator will have a special account on our forum and join as contributor to our community. However right now you can communicate with us via FB, Twitter and Google+ pages as our point is to be clear and transparent and we get in touch with all our followers using social network pages.
If we reach our 70000€ stretch goal, we'll be able to afford a new equipped official office, to widen our experienced 3d team (many people who know lots about the game understand most of work is based on 3d team) and the more staff you have the quicker process goes, monster-n-heroes  trailer video will be released, the new sets of 3d objects will be completed before we get to alpha stage and also we will finish 4 month process with the settlements of the first locations.



Right now we are the team of non-funded enthusiasts from Eastern Europe with the concept-art, scenario of the game and the readymade set of sample locations and landscapes. And, yes, of course the prototypes of our hero are also ready and you can see the sketches of the heroes on Twitter, Facebook, G+ and on our IndieGogo page. 

How your money is used
So we need to be clear about how money will be used. If we make exactly 70000€ or more it will help us to rent a new office, to set maximum equipment for 3d photo shooting, to complete first 4-month-stage process (pre-alpha) and to release the first official video trailer with the monsters and 3d faces of our characters. If this sum will be insignificantly more than planned the money will be spent on widening sets of supporting npc-characters.
If the sum of money raised will be significantly more than the necessary sum (150% and more) then money will be spent on widening of our developers  team to accelerate the process of final release of alpha, thus, alpha is released before September 2015.
To be more clear about our plans we need to say the quality of 3d scanner depends on the price. For instance, if we reach our minimum or less we will have nothing but to buy DAVID Structured Light 3D Scanner worth 3000+ euros with postage. It has minimal requirements for us to please our players with good graphics. However if we reach more than twice of the required sum  then we will be able to afford the Artec Eva 3D Scanner that costs 19000 euros with postage. The last scanner is good for the high-quality objects capture thus the detailed graphics of any object will be of premium quality. Also we will need a  set of 20 cameras, a virtual camera, a costume and hat for the further animation process. And this equipment is the minimum  requirements we needed to start 3d shooting for the game.







We will keep updating infographics about the budget reach to reflect the current status of the campaign so that all our donators could know what we’ve gathered and what goals of the list have been achieved.

What You Get
So what do our donators get out of it?  The concept of the company is not bad but  the big projects really need a big start whereas the donators need some kind of evidences of project existence and serious goals of the team. First of all, we will share the posters with any donator and that is not the question as we’ve already shared our pieces of art with the contest participants we organized on our Social pages. However more stuff as special club-cart or early alpha access will be available later on (estimated date of  alpha release - September 2015) .
If we get funds enough for renting the new office with 3d photoshoot equipment any donator will get the posters, art-books, manual books, T-shirts and bestiary stylized as our special game trend. This stuff will be the first to deliver as printable information based on the concept-art and as long as the concept-art is ready that won’t make you wait long (T-shirts and hi-res posters will be sent immediately once the money is crowdfunded)

The VIP donators will be granted the special premium and platinum accounts that means some special missions will be made only for them and some tricks will be revealed during these missions. However we are realistic and we understand that the first steps are all about renting a good office here in Riga equipped with 3d shooting means  and completion process of 3d model creation.

If you've paid for something physical (such as T-shirt, coins, pendants, printed posters etc), and you don't want to pick it up from the place we live, you will probably have to pay for the postage charges as well.
Europe: 10€/ Globally: 10€
But all the digital copies are free of charges and will be posted as we release each. The quickest delivery comes for the posters and calendars, definitely access to alpha is the longest stuff to wait. 
Also the high-level donators will not have to pay extra postal charges as it will be at expense of our team.

  The Impact 
A different type of Action-RPG
We are a different type of action-rpg genre. However we’re positioning ourselves as rpg with the elements of action and mix of other genres. When it comes to the top action-rpg games  hero can do unusual stuff and replace the whole armies using his extra abilities  but our hero will be a simple mortal thus he will have to sweat on the abilities and solve different tricky problems (as we previously mentioned he will have to come across unexpected deeds, actions and refusals by his partners). We would really love to let players feel how hard those times were and feel exactly like our hero does.

And that means unpredictable stuff of the game will make you step over the usual steps you take while playing and try to find another solution.



Currently we are working on the digital manual however the readymade book will be available as the game is completed. But the access to the early Alpha is meant to have some prompts and guidances on how to complete this or that mission. Also we put the estimated delivery date as the datewhen Alpha is completed that is September 2015 (digital art will be delivered fater).



Our team is also working on the tricky algorithms that will really make your missions even more complicated. Thus, the protagonist will have to sweat on fight with monsters - he will need to find out the monster’s weak points.
Definitely there will be a social club for the players in a long run but now it’s not our highest priority. We’re frequently asked about social club and similar matters. Going to indiegogo is a best chance to answer FAQ about our game. You can use our site, Social pages, Youtube and other channels to ask questions.
Each step is tested by ourselves, our close friends and family members who are players themselves. And thus we base each step (starting with the grass on our landscapes and finishing up with the comfort of the hero’s costume) on the opinions from both inside and outside. Yes, the vip donators will be able to join this team and will be the first to test alpha with us! We are enjoying this process and we hope you will enjoy it too.
  Risks & Challenges  
No crowdfunding campaign comes without risks, but we will try to minimize them.
The worst case scenario is if we cannot reach 70000 € our team won’t be completed and we won’t be able to rent an office with the special studio for 3d scanning process. But we will still have possibility to find sponsors here on our soils, however in that case it will take our players and fans waiting longer in comparison with the best case scenario.
But let's make sure it doesn't come to that and instead we are donated and we finally started the first 4-month process that will keep being broadcasted on our Social media Channels and the site!

  Other Ways You Can Help 
We don't just need your money! But yes, of course we actually do need it but for us it is more important to be with our community, your support and being transparent so that you know the process you are donating for and thus we think over other ways to get in touch with the interested players.

I would really like to do this with my own money, investing with other people's money gives u restraint and higher sense of responsibility. The thing is I have no money to invest in this, but really think that it could get big, any kind of donation would be great, thanks to anyone in advance, even if u just read this or take a look or whatever, cool to know i got someones attention. Enjoy!</p><p></p><p><b>MY TEAM</b></p><p>My team consists of 5 people. My brother who is senior year of architecture, he will be handling all of the designs, both interior and exterior. The other one is my friend Stefan Stancic who is styding economics also senior year. He will have no part in the business deals, making of contracts or anything like that. His purpose will be to be the economic manager once the cafe is open. I have Pavle Petrovic, stated him as a marketing manager he is an enthusiast, who will be spamming social networks, and anything he can get his hands on. And I have an IT manager who is also my friend. Wont mention his name since he didnt acceot the role in the team on Indiegogo. He is a junior software developer at Microsoft, and he will be handling the internet page, and everything technology related when the cafe is open. I will be handling the business stuff. I've been taught about these things by my father, who back in the days used to run a pretty sucesfull trading company. Business is not something you learn in schools and I can't guarante I will be good at this, but got noone better than myself, and atleast my team trust in me.</p><p><b>WHY DID WE START THIS?!</b></p><p>The first and main reason for opening a Dota cafe and making it worldwide would be promotion of Dota 2 as a game:</p><p>- Encourage more people to try it, which will result in more people playing it since it's a great game</p><p>- Make people see that Dota isn't a waste of time, it has a lot of money involved in it, that will just keep on growing</p><p>- One day maybe parents will encourage their kids to play Dota (We don't want kids to skip school or anything, just equivalent with some other afterschool activities)</p><p>- Increase the number of professional Dota players, professional tournaments, amateur tournaments (to give chance to new players), etc.</p><p>- Increase the number of Dota streamers, and promote less known players!</p><p> In the end guys, all sports, games, activities started small and not that significant, the only difference here is that with today's technology and internet things can be promoted a lot faster, so instead of 20-30 years that it took for some games/sports to become world known, we could do the same thing to Dota in maybe 1-2 years. This cafe is one of the ways to do so, so guys if u really like this game support my campaign. </p><p><b>THE BIG IDEA!</b></p><p>So in the perfect scenario where we raise all the money we need maybe even more then our goal, this is what we hope to create:</p><p>- Open it abroad, that would include finding a business partner in the US preferably, since it's the place I think Dota is more popular than any other country. If you have enough money to invest you can get anyone's attention!</p><p>- Buy/rent a large premises with a huge garden. So we would have a place where we can realize all of our ideas. We hope to have tables with Dota maps painted or in any way presented on them. A hall of fame, where we would put pictures of world renown dota players, most succesfull ones, so that people who dont play Dota can remember their faces, hear what tournaments they won, etc. Create a noob's corner (not to offend someone, just to put people who dont know about dota and are willing to learn, meaning they didnt come just for a drink, in the same place and hold like a 5-10 minute speech about the basics of the game, so they can be encouraged to try it out). My brother allready started making clay dota artifacts which we will start posting on the campaign soon. The first thing he will try to make is a Pudge's hook. It will hang on the wall with artifacts somewhere in the cafe, where people can look at it, maybe in some cases even be allowed to carry some of them. Have cosplay costumes for our employees, they probably wont be wearing them every day, maybe for some major events or something similar, but we will think more about that. Have more than one bar where people can order drinks (call one secret shop, one base, one side shop, or have 2 of each like in the game, depends of the size of the cafe). Buy a few really good computers/laptops so we can stream with cameras online what is happening in the cafe, when we make an event. Also buy a few really modern TV's we will discuss which TV's would be the best for this, which would give us the best possible picture. We would stream Dota every day, whole day. Buy tickets for all Dota events and stream them in the cafe non stop. Also we will have days when we will stream some funny dota videos, or something like that, we still havent decided on what kind of events exactly we will be hosting. We know that we will try to encourage nearby internet cafes to be hosts of some amateur dota tournaments, that we will sponsor, etc.</p><p>- The ultimate goal is this: My team manages a few dota cafes maybe 1 in Serbia, 2-3 in US/Britain, and then as we start getting big, we start selling the name to interested people. We offer them the name, our ideas for 25% of their profit and they take the name and open something similar that we would rate if it's good enough to be a Dota cafe. Something like Hard rock cafe (same concept). Sign contracts make deals, etc.</p><p>- Ofcourse buying sofas, chairs, bars, getting liquor licenses, employing an english speaking staff and everything else that goes with the opening of any cafe is mandatory.</p><b>BUSINESS PLAN</b><div>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>- 30000$</b> This amount of money is not sufficient to pay for or buy a premises that my team and I talked about (300 square meters atleast with a pretty big garden). With this kind of money we have 2 options. To open a cafe that would bring some income, set up some online commercials and it will be like a working funding campaign. The second option is to set up a site about our cafe, use the money for promotion and rerun the campaign in an attempt to raise a lot more money than the first time.</p>
<p><b>- 50000$</b> Can probably be used to open a descent cafe in Belgrade, Serbia. And still use some money for online commercialism</p>
<p><b>- 100000$</b> Would be a sufficient amount of money to open a fully set up Dota cafe in Belgrade, Serbia. Create a site and continue the promotion online.</p>
<p><b>- 200000$</b> (Goal) We chose this amount to be the goal. With this money I can contact people abroad (English speaking countries first) for some negotiations about opening it in Britain, America. The point is no serious businessman will even talk to you if u haven't got atleast 150000$</p>
<p>- Everything above this is a dream in which we can probably acomplish all of the ideas that were mentioned, and even more. </p>
<p>- If we raise less than 30000$ we will use the option 2 of the 30000$ plan just with a lot less budget to work with, it will be hard but we will try to manage, if we are unable to do anything we will just sponsor a few tournaments and give it up!</p>
<p>- Every amount of money thats like higher than these 4 goals will be the same concept, just with a little more budget thus helping us to pull it off easier. We will not waste any money, nor use for ourselves, all of the funding we receive is going towards promoting Dota as a game.</p>

<p>Dota (Defense of the ancients) is computer game. It's played 5 against 5 people who compete to destroy the enemy's main structure (the ancient). The game starts with both teams picking their heroes, out of a 100+ heroes pool. Every man should try to make their hero stronger, thus helping their teammates achieve the ultimate goal and win the game (destroy the enemy team's ancient). You improve your hero by buying items and gaining levels. It is a team game the point is to be a team player, help others and not just try to win it by yourself (impossible in 99% of cases). This game requires a lot of skill, but the most important thing is tactics and teamwork. In the begining it's hard to understand the game it's very complex and hard, but allways fun to play even if you have no idea what you are doing. That's it for the intro, download Steam and then download Dota, try it!!!</p>
<p>Dota is also the leading game in the world when it comes to tournament prizes. This year's prize pool on the world championship (The international) was over 10 million dollars. It's a game that's getting more and more support every day. Help me promote it even more, even if u just start playing and dont support me I'll be happy i brought more people to play this amazing game.</p>
<p><b>WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TO OFFER YOU!</b></p>
<p>Both my team and myself are very sad that at the moment, we can't offer you guys anything in return for your good will of funding our project. We haven't even taken any serious steps since the idea hasn't begun to spread as much as we would like it to. We hope that you can understand our plan and what we are trying to accomplish. If you have any suggestions, ideas any kind of help would be appreciated. We hope that one day if we are fully operational in more than 1 country, and have allready spread through the entire world we can in some way make it up to the people that believed in this, and by funding us helped us accomplish it, by then all we can say is: <b>Thank you!</b></p>

</div></div>","Short Summary 
My name is Spartaco Albertarelli, I'm a professional game designer, with 30 years of experience and more than 100 games published so far (some of my games on Pinterest). After a life spent designing games for game publishers, I decided to open my own company: KaleidosGames. In ancient Greek, Kaleidos means ""beautiful images"" and I believe that in games art is as important as the rules.

KaleidosGames is a very small company, but we know how to design and manufacture good quality games, thanks to my long experience. 
The idea behind this project is a little bit ""crazy"": revamping one of the most ancient and sophisticated Italian card game (Scopone), adding a twist and a stunning deck of illustrated cards.

The original game is usually played with the typical Italian cards and it's almost unknown outside my country. It's a pity, because it a very clever game.
What we did can be summarized by a simple image: from this 
to this


Primiera will let you play either the classic game and my personal evolution, using a deck of modern design cards, with stunning art and all the values clearly printed. 
The 40 cards are tarot size, and they are all fully illustrated.
You can read and download the rules (in English, French, German, Spanish and Italian) on my Issuu page.
You can have a look at the entire deck on our facebook page. 
What We Need & What You Get

The entire project is already finished. All the artworks are ready, and we'll print the game in any case, also if goal is not reached. This is the reason why we set our goal to just $ 2.000. 
KaleidosGames is not yet distributed in many countries outside Italy and we are not ready to start a professional online selling, so this can be a good chance to put your hand on a game that could be difficult to find in your usual game store. 
If you made an offer to receive a copy of the game and you like to have the game signed by the author you must simply ask, but you will receive the box unwrapped.    
Risks & Challenges

 
This is a flexible campaign. It means that you will get your stuff also if the goal is not reached.  When the crowd-funding campaign is over, we'll be ready to send you  what you payed for almost immediately.
Deliveries are estimated by the end of November. If you like to make an original Christmas gift, that's a perfect timing!
Delivery cost must be payed separately and depends on the country where you live. We are hard working on finding the best prices and we'll do our best to satisfy any special request you can have, managing every single delivery. 
  Other Ways You Can Help 
If you don't want to contribute, you should talk about this project to your friends. There are so many card game fans in the world... Don't forget the Indiegogo share tools! Your support to every single campaign can improve the chance to have new ideas available for the entire community.
Because this is our very first crowdfunding campaign we don't have great experience about international deliveries of this kind. Any suggestion about a way to lower the delivery prices from Italy is very welcome.

The game is really nice: it has all the deepness of standard Scopone with some nice twist. 
A real nice opportunity to gamers to learn one of the best traditional Italian card games.

tournaments again by the end of the summer. This is where you come in. The
Nebulous team is $8,000 short of the initial deposit. The purpose of this

club, a training facility for those who aspire to be the best, a hangout spot for casual players, a place for old
friends to gather and for new friendships to be made. On behalf of the Nebulous

<p>So what it is iGaming? iGaming is the brainchild of a small group of people who have been heavily involved in gaming for many years.

<p><strong>TCG gaming </strong>(MTG, Pokemon, Yugioh etc.)</p>

<p> </p>
<p>But iGaming is more than just writing a series of books on gaming, it is designed to be a community hub, while the guides will be written primarily by myself and my team (well, me and 3 others…) we want the community to get involved, to offer up bits and pieces to include and to offer us support…</p>
<p> </p>

<p><strong><em>So what about these books?!</em></strong></p>
<p>These will all be absolutely <strong>FREE </strong>(with the exception of the printed books, these you’ll have to pay for postage, but that’s it!)<strong> – </strong>I’d like to make it clear here that we are a non-profit group; we are not doing this to raise any sort of money for ourselves, just to give something back to the community!</p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>Ah, back to the reason we’re here, the books! We want to create a series of books on gaming which will be published digitally, on the iPad (iBooks) on Android (ePUB) as PDFs and as printed copies.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As far as the books go, we want to produce one for each element of each system of each type of gaming… For example we want to produce a tactics book for each army of each Tabletop Gaming system, we want to produce a walkthrough for digital games and we want to produce guides for TCGs (little bit harder to break down how we’ll divide the books due to the different nature of each game system).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Each book will be…</p>
<ul>
<li>Greater than 100 pages in length</li>
<li>Full of interactive features (videos, pictures, interactive HTML widgets so much we want to pack in!)</li>
<li>Be useful and tested! We will have a ‘beta group’ who will test and review our books first, so when we do publish them, they will be of a high quality!</li>
<li>Regulated by you! Yes, you read that right, as these books are being sold for free and for the sole purpose of giving something back to the community we want you to shape the way they are made, you want more of one type of book being produced, then fine, that’s what we’ll do!</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p><strong><em>There must be a catch; you can’t be giving away all these books for FREE?!</em></strong></p>
<p>Nope, no catch, everything we produce will be free (minus any shipping costs if you order a physical product) but we do need some help getting started…</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><em>Help us get this project started!</em></strong></p>
<p>Like is said, we need some help getting started, while we have most of the things we need to do this project, we are lacking a few things</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li> An iMac (without this we can’t create any iBooks, or add art to any books of any format)</li>
<li>An artist (you do want high quality pictures and illustrations in your books don’t you?!)</li>
<li> A programmer (while we all have computer knowledge, this is mainly in the book creation department rather than in the programing side; we need someone to write us a few HTML widgets)</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p>Cost wise this equates to £2000 ($3000) ideally we want to raise more, as this would let us give out more printed copies of books, buy higher quality equipment etc. Basically the more money we can raise, the faster we can produce higher quality books!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><em>So why should I donate?</em></strong></p>
<p>In conclusion, if you donate you will be helping us kick-start a massive project, one which will provide resources for, and benefit you and the entire gaming community! We’re not asking much, any small donation will go a long way to helping us achieve our goal!</p>

In conclusion, if you donate you will be helping us kick-start a massive project, one which will provide resources for, and benefit you and the entire gaming community! We’re not asking much, any small donation will go a long way to helping us achieve our goal!
 
If you can’t give then we ask that you help us out by sharing this page; help us get our idea to as many people as we can!
