WHY AM I HERE?<strong><p>A few years ago I was driving on Interstate 75 here in SW Florida. It was dusk and I needed to change from my sunglasses to my regular eyeglasses. My eyeglasses were held in a holder that I clipped to my sun visor.</p>
<p>I’m sure that you have one or more of these holders in your car. They are sold all over the place for around $4. They clip onto your visor and hold your sunglasses or eyeglasses.</p>
<p>I reached up and clicked the button on the visor holder to release my glasses. After I clicked the button my glasses fell right out of the holder towards the steering wheel. My reflex reaction was to grab for the glasses so they wouldn't break. As I reached for the glasses my SUV swerved towards the guard rail at 75 mph. I nearly went off the road but managed to correct the steering and avoid a horrible accident... all because of an eyeglass holder.</p>
<p>For the next several weeks I couldn't stop thinking about how I could have been killed just reaching for my eyeglasses. I decided that there has to be a better, safer way to store them. So I started playing with some ideas and worked on some sketches and designed spexGrip.</p>
<p><b>SPEX WHAT?</b></p>
<p>Have YOU ever misplaced or left the house without your glasses? Ever have your sunglasses fall from YOUR visor holder or FLY OFF your console or dash? Or like me almost DRIVE OFF THE ROAD to grab your glasses?</p>
<p>Well NEVER AGAIN with <b>spexGrip</b>.</p>
<p>spexGrip's unique patented design holds eyeglasses, sunglasses or reading glasses in your car or ANY ROOM IN YOUR HOME OR OFFICE. Eyewear can be stored and removed easily with one hand. Whether they are wire rim, big designer sunglasses or any size in between <b>spexGrip</b> will keep your eyewear in the SAME PLACE every time and SAFE from dropping and getting scratched or broken.</p></strong><br/><p></p>
<p><b>WHO ARE YOU?</b></p>
<p>My name is Joe
DiCioccio. My wife Diane and I live in southwest Florida. We are retired
but both work to supplement our social security. Diane is a cashier in a local
supermarket and I work as a chauffeur.</p>
<p>Before we moved to
Florida I was a sales and marketing consultant for the IT industry in New
York City for over thirty five years. Diane was the Payroll Administrator for
one of the Colleges in the State University of New York.</p>

<br/><strong>
<p>Our prototypes with 'soft feel' were tested in the hottest temperatures (Florida car interiors in the summer),
coldest temps (cars in New York last winter), in the shower for humidity and in
the Fridge as well as the freezer. The prototypes didn’t crack, chip or melt
and maintained suction. They held up beautifully!</p>
<p>A manufacturer has
been selected and has given us formal price quotes for tooling, production and
shipping. One of my first jobs was in the plastics industry so I’m familiar
with this process and the materials. I was involved in developing the patented

<p><b>SO WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS AT YOUR AGE?</b></p>
<p>Well there are
several reasons. </p>
<p>First of all this one small idea began to take on a life of it's own. <strong style=""font-size: 16px; background-color: initial;""></strong></p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; display: inline !important;"">I started playing with this idea for a sunglasses holder as something that I could use for my own car. Soon I realized that others, like YOU, could use it in your car to keep your 'EYES ON THE ROAD YOUR HANDS UPON THE WHEEL.'  - Thank you, 'The DOORS.' Yeah... sorry couldn't resist that one.</p></strong>
</div>
<div>
<strong><p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Next we realized that IF IT WORKS IN THE CAR THEN WHY NOT IN THE HOUSE! Soon we had our prototypes in each of our two cars and in every room of the house. </p></strong><strong><p><strong></strong></p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>We gave the prototypes to friends around the country for testing... they didn't want to send them back! A few of them even had their prototype 'BORROWED' by their spouse.</b></p></strong><strong><p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; display: inline !important;"">So we have designed a product that solves a common problem, 'Where's my glasses?' It's EASY TO USE and INEXPENSIVE … I like that. </p></strong><strong style=""font-size: 16px; background-color: initial;""><p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; display: inline !important;"">The idea of seeing this product for sale <b>ANYWHERE</b> would be a real kick for me.</p></strong>
</div>
<div><strong><p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong style=""font-size: 16px; background-color: initial;""></strong></p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; display: inline !important;"">Being retired the EXTRA INCOME would also really help. I don’t want to be an 85 year old chauffeur – that’s of course assuming that anyone wants an 85 year old chauffeur.</p></strong></div>
<div>
<strong>
<p><b>BUT THE MOST
IMPORTANT REASON FOR ME… </b></p>
<p>On September 11,
2001 I was scheduled to meet an associate in the North Tower of the World Trade
Center. My meeting was cancelled the evening before. Neither one of us went to the World Trade Center that day. If not for that last minute change in plans I could have been a victim
of that terrible tragedy on <b>9/11</b>. I
am still thankful every day that my life and that of my associate was spared.</p>
<p>In 1992 I had a
heart attack. Then I dealt with prostate cancer in 2011. In 2014 I was
diagnosed and treated for bladder cancer. Today I have clear arteries and I am
cancer free. And I am VERY THANKFUL EVERYDAY!</p>
<p>Most of my life has
been lived on the premise that you are what you think about most. The death of
a great talent, <b>Robin Williams</b>,
confirms this yet again for me although tragically… ‘Your thoughts are not who
you are. Your thoughts are who you become.’</p>
<p>I have been blessed with an incredible,
beautiful wife for over 45 years, two wonderful and talented sons and two years
ago an amazing Grandson. So for my health today and my incredible family I am truly blessed and extremely thankful.</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>From this very simple idea to just solve a problem for storing sunglasses in my car we now have a notebook FULL OF IDEAS for products that solve other common problems. </strong></p>
<strong><p style=""display: inline !important;"">So now at 68 I want to
start a company that makes cool gadgets and gizmos. I’m not sure why or how it
happened but over the past few years I’ve been getting all these neat ideas for
gadgets. Maybe the radiation treatments for my cancer sparked some creative brain cells…</p></strong>
<p><strong><strong></strong></strong></p>
<p>So NOW that one small idea is growing into a COMPANY! A company that designs and brings to market simple, inexpensive gadgets and gizmos that solve a problem while bringing a smile to your face.<strong style=""font-size: 16px; background-color: initial;""></strong></p>
<p style=""display: inline !important;"">The company will be
called <b>IZZI MO</b>...</p></strong><strong>

<br/><p>All the blessings in my life prove for me that no matter what comes your way in life <b>YOU AND ONLY YOU</b> decide how it will
affect you.</p>
<p>Maybe, WITH YOUR HELP, this one small idea and this dream, can grow into something real.</p>
<p>Maybe, WITH YOUR HELP, we can inspire others to NEVER GIVE UP ON THEIR DREAMS!</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to learn about us and spexGrip. We hope that you
will decide to help us.</p>

WHY AM I HERE?A few years ago I was driving on Interstate 75 here in SW Florida. It was dusk and I needed to change from my sunglasses to my regular eyeglasses. My eyeglasses were held in a holder that I clipped to my sun visor.
I’m sure that you have one or more of these holders in your car. They are sold all over the place for around $4. They clip onto your visor and hold your sunglasses or eyeglasses.
I reached up and clicked the button on the visor holder to release my glasses. After I clicked the button my glasses fell right out of the holder towards the steering wheel. My reflex reaction was to grab for the glasses so they wouldn't break. As I reached for the glasses my SUV swerved towards the guard rail at 75 mph. I nearly went off the road but managed to correct the steering and avoid a horrible accident... all because of an eyeglass holder.
For the next several weeks I couldn't stop thinking about how I could have been killed just reaching for my eyeglasses. I decided that there has to be a better, safer way to store them. So I started playing with some ideas and worked on some sketches and designed spexGrip.
SPEX WHAT?
Have YOU ever misplaced or left the house without your glasses? Ever have your sunglasses fall from YOUR visor holder or FLY OFF your console or dash? Or like me almost DRIVE OFF THE ROAD to grab your glasses?
Well NEVER AGAIN with spexGrip.
spexGrip's unique patented design holds eyeglasses, sunglasses or reading glasses in your car or ANY ROOM IN YOUR HOME OR OFFICE. Eyewear can be stored and removed easily with one hand. Whether they are wire rim, big designer sunglasses or any size in between spexGrip will keep your eyewear in the SAME PLACE every time and SAFE from dropping and getting scratched or broken.
WHO ARE YOU?
My name is Joe
DiCioccio. My wife Diane and I live in southwest Florida. We are retired
but both work to supplement our social security. Diane is a cashier in a local
supermarket and I work as a chauffeur.
Before we moved to
Florida I was a sales and marketing consultant for the IT industry in New
York City for over thirty five years. Diane was the Payroll Administrator for
one of the Colleges in the State University of New York.







HOW FAR ALONG ARE YOU WITH SPEXGRIP?

We have secured a
patent for our design.

For prototypes we
had several plastic cubes made on a 3-D printer based on our unique design. Suction
cups that we purchased and modified were glued to the cubes. These prototypes
were used to determine the best dimensions for spexGrip. The dimensions we
came up with allow spexGrip to accommodate a wide range of eyewear from wire
rim to large designer sunglasses while taking up a minimum amount of space.

We have researched dozens of different materials. We needed a soft material to guarantee the suction would hold and the eyewear would not be scratched or damaged. We also want to be environmentally friendly and avoid any potentially toxic chemicals. spexGrip will be injection molded as one piece using a ‘soft feel’ plastic.

Our prototypes with 'soft feel' were tested in the hottest temperatures (Florida car interiors in the summer),
coldest temps (cars in New York last winter), in the shower for humidity and in
the Fridge as well as the freezer. The prototypes didn’t crack, chip or melt
and maintained suction. They held up beautifully!
A manufacturer has
been selected and has given us formal price quotes for tooling, production and
shipping. One of my first jobs was in the plastics industry so I’m familiar
with this process and the materials. I was involved in developing the patented
process for manufacturing the plastic foam seals that are still used today in
the caps of plastic bottles. 
The mechanical drawings
for the spexGrip mold are complete and approved by the manufacturer. 
WHAT DOES SPEXGRIP NEED FROM US?
What we don't have are
the funds to manufacture our first spexGrip. This is where we NEED YOUR HELP.
Help us reach our
funding goal of $3,600 so that we can pay for the mold and our first 
spexGrips. Any and all funding that we receive will be used for bringing spexGrip to the
market.
Once we receive our
spexGrips from the manufacturer we will sell the product locally. We already
have a commitment from several vendors here in SW Florida. We will keep some of
the spexGrips so that I can use them to begin marketing and selling to
distributors and retailers. As I mentioned I have over thirty-five years of experience in sales… 
Our goal is to have
spexGrip sold as an ‘impulse’ item near the checkout counters for dozens of
retailers. Our ‘Target’ – pardon the pun – is any  home products, auto
products, convenience store, gas station, supermarket, pharmacy or Big Box store. Even Hallmark would
be an excellent outlet for us.
If you can’t help
fund our campaign then please help us SPREAD THE WORD to others about
spexGrip. Use Indiegogo share tools, like us on Facebook, tell you friends and
family about us.
WHAT'S IN IT FOR US CONTRIBUTORS?
If you’re someone that likes cool stuff and likes being an innovator
then by funding spexGrip you’ll have as a perk a product that is UNIQUE.
You’ll be the FIRST to have one. 
When spexGrip begins replacing all those cheap, ‘needs two hands’, dangerous sunglass holders
you can say ‘I had it FIRST.’ 
You’re ‘ahead of
your time’. You my friend are an INNOVATOR, a GENIUS, a TRENDSETTER!
But seriously and most importantly you can help us with our DREAM! As you'll read below we have ideas and designs for several other products. Our dream is to bring these products to the market through our own company. With your help we can begin to build this company and make our dream a reality.
IT'S NOT A SEXY PRODUCT, IS THERE A MARKET?
OK spexGrip is not
a sexy product – in fact the NAME is sexier than what it does - but it solves a
problem and it’s inexpensive. 
There are
approximately 250 Million registered
vehicles in the U.S. That’s MILLION!
Even a tiny piece of that market is a win. Here’s why… each person that buys a
spexGrip for their car will probably go back and buy one for their kitchen,
bath, bedroom and office. You’ll even be able to store eyewear on your coffee
table, kitchen counter or nightstand with our design for a spexGrip stand - a follow
up product.
They will make
great gifts… 
Get some for your
PARENTS or GRANDPARENTS! Ask them how many times they misplace their ‘READERS.’
With spexGrip they can keep their glasses in the same place all the time and SAFE FROM SCRATCHES OR BREAKING.
Get some for your
friends - they would be GREAT GIFTS - to keep their sunglasses HANDY AND SAFE in the car.
WE CAN GET ANY COLOR AS LONG AS IT'S BLACK?
Well for our first
order we’re going with basic black. But as we reorder we can go with FRUITY COLORS like...

GREEN APPLE

STRAWBERRY

or even a ‘camo’
look – like you know those Duck guys!



In fact if you have
color or design ideas we’d love to hear about them. Check out our perk for colors!

We’re also
designing spexGrips with BLING for all those ‘REAL HOUSEWIVES’ - precious
looking stones on the two sides or your initial on the front.


NO MORE FRIDGE MAGNETS?
We’re even talking
to a promotional product company about using spexGrip as company giveaways…
your COMPANY NAME AND LOGO PRINTED ON THE FRONT of an eyewear holder... what company wouldn't LOVE THAT!!!
Imagine INSURANCE
AND REAL ESTATE BROKERS having the opportunity to have their name in front of
you while you’re driving or in your kitchen… better than those dumb calendars
or fridge magnets or pens that they give away. 
Just imagine how
many of these we can sell!

SO WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS AT YOUR AGE?
Well there are
several reasons. 
First of all this one small idea began to take on a life of it's own. 
I started playing with this idea for a sunglasses holder as something that I could use for my own car. Soon I realized that others, like YOU, could use it in your car to keep your 'EYES ON THE ROAD YOUR HANDS UPON THE WHEEL.'  - Thank you, 'The DOORS.' Yeah... sorry couldn't resist that one.


Next we realized that IF IT WORKS IN THE CAR THEN WHY NOT IN THE HOUSE! Soon we had our prototypes in each of our two cars and in every room of the house. 
We gave the prototypes to friends around the country for testing... they didn't want to send them back! A few of them even had their prototype 'BORROWED' by their spouse.So we have designed a product that solves a common problem, 'Where's my glasses?' It's EASY TO USE and INEXPENSIVE … I like that. The idea of seeing this product for sale ANYWHERE would be a real kick for me.


Being retired the EXTRA INCOME would also really help. I don’t want to be an 85 year old chauffeur – that’s of course assuming that anyone wants an 85 year old chauffeur.


BUT THE MOST
IMPORTANT REASON FOR ME… 
On September 11,
2001 I was scheduled to meet an associate in the North Tower of the World Trade
Center. My meeting was cancelled the evening before. Neither one of us went to the World Trade Center that day. If not for that last minute change in plans I could have been a victim
of that terrible tragedy on 9/11. I
am still thankful every day that my life and that of my associate was spared.
In 1992 I had a
heart attack. Then I dealt with prostate cancer in 2011. In 2014 I was
diagnosed and treated for bladder cancer. Today I have clear arteries and I am
cancer free. And I am VERY THANKFUL EVERYDAY!
Most of my life has
been lived on the premise that you are what you think about most. The death of
a great talent, Robin Williams,
confirms this yet again for me although tragically… ‘Your thoughts are not who
you are. Your thoughts are who you become.’
I have been blessed with an incredible,
beautiful wife for over 45 years, two wonderful and talented sons and two years
ago an amazing Grandson. So for my health today and my incredible family I am truly blessed and extremely thankful.

From this very simple idea to just solve a problem for storing sunglasses in my car we now have a notebook FULL OF IDEAS for products that solve other common problems. 
So now at 68 I want to
start a company that makes cool gadgets and gizmos. I’m not sure why or how it
happened but over the past few years I’ve been getting all these neat ideas for
gadgets. Maybe the radiation treatments for my cancer sparked some creative brain cells…

So NOW that one small idea is growing into a COMPANY! A company that designs and brings to market simple, inexpensive gadgets and gizmos that solve a problem while bringing a smile to your face.
The company will be
called IZZI MO...


All the blessings in my life prove for me that no matter what comes your way in life YOU AND ONLY YOU decide how it will
affect you.
Maybe, WITH YOUR HELP, this one small idea and this dream, can grow into something real.
Maybe, WITH YOUR HELP, we can inspire others to NEVER GIVE UP ON THEIR DREAMS!
Thank you for taking the time to learn about us and spexGrip. We hope that you
will decide to help us.
Thank you,

VIITA Active comes with a TFT LCD color touchscreen, built-in GPS, and two additional fitness features: My Challenge & My Sets.   The VIITA Casual is a hybrid smartwatch with a classic dial combined with a digital black and white display, designed for those who want to keep track of their health, but also want a functional, everyday watch.  Combining the best of both worlds, the VIITA Watch offers the finest watchmaking craftsmanship paired with technology of the future. Acting as a personal coach on your wrist, VIITA offers a variety of features that fit anyone's lifestyle. From avid runners to traveling businessmen, VIITA has something for you.   The VIITA Active and Casual tell you how exhausted or recovered your body is, keeping your body safe and as healthy as possible.  The body’s regeneration depends on the state of strain or recovery your body is in. We know life can get crazy, causing you to experience various situations of strain such as work, stress, exercise, sleep deprivation and poor diet. To ensure those strains don’t cause harm to your body, it is important to take appropriate measures such as sufficient sleep, rest days, stress reducing exercises, a healthy diet, etc. Those strains and recoveries are measured by the regeneration status.  Heart Rate Variability is determined by the changes in your heart rate levels throughout your daily life.  Studies suggest that high heart rate variability indicates good health and high fitness levels. On the other hand, low heart rate variability indicates burnout or a stressful lifestyle. By combining the information about your heart, your movements and sleep we are not only able to calculate your stress level and regeneration status but are able to wake you up at the perfect time or provide you with the optimal training recommendation. Continuously be aware of how you react to activities, breaks, stress, and sleep in real time. VIITA's intelligent, self-learning algorithm calculates your stress level and regeneration status based on your heart rate, heart rate variability, 3D acceleration data, height, weight, sleep quality, training intensity, training volume, age and gender. Due to the high complexity of our algorithm and the uniqueness of each’s body, the VIITA SCAN provides health screenings in real time.  After one hour of use, the VIITA Scan calibrates 10%-30%, after one day 30%-60%, after a week 60%-80% and after 2 weeks 80%-99%. VIITA SCAN continues to learn how your body works to give specific feedback to you. The more you wear it, the better it reads you and your vital signs.  Wake up feeling refreshed, thanks to VIITA waking you within a 30 minute window during your lightest period of sleep. VIITA Wake analyzes your personal sleep patterns, based off your heartrate, heart variability, and your movements while asleep.  Stay hydrated at all times by tracking the amount of water you consume throughout the day.Do you know how much water you need a day? It’s a known fact that water is crucial to maintaining a healthy body. To keep you perfectly hydrated, VIITA calculates the amount of water you should consume every day based on an in-house developed algorithm that considers your heart rate, heart rate variability, 3D acceleration data, height, weight, sleep quality, training intensity, training volume, age, and gender. Challenge yourself to meet your fitness and overall health goals. With state of the art technology and a 20 Hz heart rate sensor, VIITA offers you a wide variety of unique and specific health and fitness recommendations. VIITA Coach provides intelligent and personalized training recommendations that are tailored to the needs of your body. VIITA Coach will tell you whether cardio or interval training, heavy or light weights are what you need depending on the stress levels your body experiences throughout the day. For example, if you’ve had a stressful day, VIITA will assess your heart rate, steps, and hours of sleep to recommend a walk rather than a run. On days when you’re rested and physically prepared, VIITA Coach will push you to tackle a high-intensity interval workout your body is ready for.  Target your problem areas with My Mission and transform your body. Set your fitness and body goals on the VIITA smartphone app and My Mission will adapt its training recommendation automatically! Want to lose weight? Select the weight loss option and your VIITA will recommend training intensities targeting your fat burn zone. My Challenge allows you to set your fitness goals (distance, time, speed) and track in real time if you are ahead or behind your target thanks to the built-in GPS sensor in the VIITA Active.  Choose the VIITA Active and you get to experience My Challenge!  VIITA Active’s built-in GPS tracks and visualizes the distance you have covered on your screen. The VIITA GPS sensor also supports Glonass, Galile, and Beidou. With an update-rate of up to 10 Hz and a localization accuracy of up to 20cm, you can leave the house for a run without your phone! Only featured on the VIITA Active, My Sets lets you determine the perfect timing between your resting periods and sets, to optimize your muscle growth.Your VIITA signals through subtle vibrations when to exercise or to take a break. Exercise times and training times can be individually adjusted in the VIITA App. For activity tracking, VIITA comes with 19 different activities to choose from.The trackable activities will continue to grow as the platform continues to mature and refine. Our activity tracking comes with: running, cycling, walking, hiking, mountain climbing, rowing, skiing, cross-country skiing, cross-country skating, inline skating, nordic walking, mountain biking, treadmill running, cross trainer, rowing ergometer, nordic walking on treadmill, cycling ergometer, stepper, and racing.  With a top of the line power management and software system, VIITA offers a variety of ways to stay in touch while you take care of your health. Through the VIITA App you can decide when and about what you want to be notified. Receive personal calls, WhatsApp, text messages, and more. Don't want to receive notifications? No problem. Simply choose the silent mode to switch off. With VIITA’s Silent Mode you can quickly and easily turn off all your notifications. Access all features, fitness and sleep results in easy to read charts, settings, and notifications straight from our VIITA App to your VIITA Watch.VIITA is built with a power management system that outlasts any other smartwatch on the market. With customized 530mAh and 385mAh lithium-ion batteries, the VIITA Active stays charged for up to 3 weeks and VIITA Casual stays charged for up to one month. Our team has made sure that no space is wasted in the VIITA Watch. With code written as efficiently as possible and all non-essential processes turned off, we are able to optimize the settings for components such as vibrating times and strength, screen activity, or data compression to allow more space for battery power.     
 
  In early 2016 Alex suffered a severe sports injury. Trying to speed up his recovery process, he extensively researched therapy that could aid in his recovery and he discovered the Vital Monitor. Thanks to the positive effects on his body, Alex was convinced of the Vital Monitor's capabilities and decided to reach out to the inventor, Martin.While his invention was already an amazing product on its own, Alexander saw the opportunity to kill two birds with one stone by creating a well designed Smartwatch with the Vital Monitor technology. His dream of developing a beautiful smartwatch and giving more people access to Martin’s ground-breaking technology became a reality.The biggest challenge was to adapt the algorithm to the smartwatch’s sensors. After months of testing and coding, Martin finally came up with a solution and the foundation of a new generation of health tracking devices was created, the VIITA Watch.     Alexander basically grew up in the watch industry.

<p>The desire to simplify this bag-switching process is what gave birth to Kristin Ashford Bags! Four sizes of pouches that can organize all the contents of your bag -- pencil case, small pouch, medium pouch (make up) and large pouch. Use one for cables and computer accessories, another for keys and pens, and another for make-up.</p>
<p>I wanted the style to be basic, but not boring. I also wanted them to feel great, have a bit of zing, and be made in the USA with the highest quality materials. I’ve been fascinated with neoprene and excited about the possibilities it holds for fashion so I decided to make one side leather and the other side neoprene. The neoprene is dyed to match the leather, and the bags are finished off with my signature cobalt blue zipper. For a touch of pizzazz, inside I use a patterned outdoor fabric, which can be wiped clean. I started with four classic colors – black, red, camel, and grey.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>These bags, not only look and feel amazing, but they are functional. I carry a lot around especially when I am working, and my pouches keep everything within easy reach. I don’t have to dig around for days to find pens, keys, lipstick, or that dose of Advil. It also makes changing bags so simple. No more dumping the entire contents of my bag out to see what I need take. I just pop the pouches in the bag I want to wear and off I go!</p>

<p><strong>TS4A - T-Shirts for Africa...</strong>Apparel with a conscience. </p>
<p>TS4A was carved out of a need to be more socially responsible, without an extra cost to the everyday consumer. During a class trip to Brazil, I was graced with the opportunity to visit both large and small companies and discuss with their executives about their operations. One thing I noticed from all the places we visited was, they all had a program to give back to the community, regardless of what industry they belonged to. This had become a culture and these companies did not need some sort of recognition for it. They were able to successfully integrate it into their organizational culture.</p>
<p>I was made to understand that regardless of how small or large your business was, there is always an opportunity to give back or be socially responsible. When I returned back to the U.S, I graduated a week after and with no immediate job, I decided to take the time to start a t-shirt project. I got a couple friends involved and we decided to buy a screen printing machine. </p>

<h3>Snapshot:</h3>
<p>So this project is about creating a much better emergency shelter, which can also be used, (and reused) as a 3rd world, or refugee, housing alternative.</p>
<p><img alt=""Kids playing in a refugee camp"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.cbc.ca/gfx/images/news/photos/2009/05/19/pakistan-kids-cp-w6726515.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Kids playing in a refugee camp""/></p>
<p>There is a need for really low cost shelter:</p>

<h3>What is needed is a really <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">cheap</span> form of shelter </h3>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Insulated</strong>!</span> so it is warmer in winter and cooler in summer ....</p>
<p>Immediately below is a CAD image of a shelter made from just one element.</p>
<p>If you look closely you will note the red sheets appear wider on the outside ..... Actually the red and grey sheets are locked together! Where they lock together forms a laminate ""compression tension"" arched beam.</p>
<h3>This is Flex Mechanism at it simplest.</h3>

<h3>What I do</h3>
<p>I develop ideas. It is my passion. It been a long journey, but I have learnt a bit along the way about how to turn ideas into working prototypes.</p>
<p>For example in 2011 I sold a technology called ""<a href=""http://youtu.be/CT7WtCI8opc?t=31s"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Flexloft"">Flexloft</a>"" to Nike USA:</p>
<p><a href=""http://youtu.be/aT94kAXBgwI?t=33s"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""FlexLoft by Nike from Simon Moore""><img alt=""Inventor: Simon Moore"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.appliedgolftechnology.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/nike-covert-driver-2.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Nike 2013 Covert Driver""/></a> </p>
<h3>But ideas mean a lot more if they do good.</h3>
<p>I call this ""Design with Heart""</p>
<p>Recently I have been working on a new approach to building which is very simple. It is ideal for shelter and housing for those who need it most.</p>
<ul>
<li>It can also (later) be developed for simple bridges, dams, and water tanks.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt=""Water water water - lovely water"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.actalliance.org/gallery/africa/kenya/dadaab-camp/kenya2011jeffrey-dadaab231786.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Water water water - lovely water""/></p>
<h2>This project can save and improve lives</h2>
<p>Ideas mean nothing .... To turn ideas into SOLUTIONS needs time and money.</p>
<p>Yep ..... Ideas mean nothing-zippo-nada .... unless they deliver. I want to really attack this project and I need your help.</p>
<p><img alt=""Smile"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-L_y-JXvYNYE/UO27aL8NscI/AAAAAAAAAtM/1s3WQcNIf1Q/s1600/smiley_face_flower-02.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Smile""/></p>

<h3>Ok .... Lets get technical for a moment:</h3>
<p>Have you ever tried to crush an egg in your hand? It <a href=""http://vimeo.com/31274761"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Man vs Egg"">can be done</a>, but the humble egg does quite well in the ""Man vs Egg"" test.</p>
<p>Actually an egg can survive 50 to 90lb of force:</p>
<p><img alt=""Man vs Egg"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://b.vimeocdn.com/ts/309/665/309665902_640.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Man vs Egg""/></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Yes curves are very strong, but we usually build with straight lines. But once upon a time we built more with curves:</p>
<p><img alt=""Railway bridge"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://destinationwestport.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/newport-seven-arch-bridge-580x407.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Railway bridge""/></p>
<p>Indeed we still use arches in elegant and strong ways today:</p>
<p><img alt=""St Louis Gateway Arch"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.mathsinthecity.com/sites/www.mathsinthecity.com/files/Gateway%20Arch.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""St Louis Gateway Arch""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>So how about using arches for cheap shelter and housing?</p>
<p>If you want to have a quick simple building one can use the strength and simplicity of an arch with common ole corrugated iron ....</p>
<p><img alt=""Corrugated iron ... 180years old and still relevant"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.scrapmetalyard.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/corrugated-iron.jpeg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Corrugated iron ... 180years old and still relevant""/></p>
<p>OK so lets use the power of the arch and corrugated iron to make simple affordable structures....</p>
<p>But there is one more thing needed here. It is a simple thing. It is the ""mechanical glue"" that makes this work. To illustrate the principle grab two plastic rulers:</p>
<p><img alt=""Flex mechanism can be demo'd with two rulers"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://2.imimg.com/data2/MJ/MV/MY-802479/plastic-ruler-500x500.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Flex mechanism can be demo'd with two rulers""/></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Seperate them at each end by a finger so they are roughly parallel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bend them!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>What happens?</p>
<p>The centers move close together .... and if something is the middle the rulers will trap it via a distributed friction force!</p>
<p>Now what if the rulers were a <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">lot stornger</span>, and <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">connected at the edges</span> ..... You could have a U shape ruler, or an S or H crossection .... bend the shape now and the closure will still happen.</p>
<p>Pretty simple eh! But great design often lives in simplicity. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ok, technogogy over ....</p>
<h3>I need your help to refine this technology and create a shelter solution ready to use:</h3>
<p>One thing I have learnt in the last decade or so is that you have to design with purpose.</p>
<p>The end user really matters whether it is a sneaky improvement to a golf club, or a quick and safe shelter for earthquake survivors in a remote mountainous area in Central Asia.</p>
<p>So for emergency shelter we have to pay attention to ALL of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cheap, and</li>
<li>Using local technologies if possible, and </li>
<li>Portable, and</li>
<li>Safe, and</li>
<li>Super easy to assemble, with minimal tools, and no English language requirement!</li>
</ol>

<p>Yep, I need financial assistance to make this happen, but i am aware some people reading this will also have a great mix of skills and passion, for this project, so you can also help with your time:</p>

<h2>Appendix: Project Overview</h2>
<p>For those of you who want a sense of the things that need to be done here following is an overview. This is not a tight sequential list, but merely scoping a list of things to work through:</p>
<h3><em>1. Current Status</em></h3>
<ol>
<li><em>Technical samples to hand &amp; </em></li>
<li><em>Some understanding of the wish list for emergency shelter &amp;</em></li>
<li><em>Moving now to larger forms &amp;</em></li>
<li><em>Testing ways of making S and H connectors for corrugated sheet.</em></li>
</ol><h3><em>2. What do aid agencies need?</em></h3>
<ol>
<li><em>Contact key aid agencies to better understand what is ideal.</em></li>
<li><em>Review current solutions, and problems ....</em></li>
<li><em>Research transport issues and limits.</em></li>
<li><em>Research production technologies available in the key geographical areas of Asia, Middle East, Africa, the Pacific, and </em></li>
<li><em>Conduct historical research on issues found in past emergencies, and third world crises.</em></li>
</ol><h3><em>3. What is the best technology to use?</em></h3>
<ol>
<li><em>Extruded plastic/fiber-reinforced plastic/aluminum/other?</em></li>
<li><em>Can fiber reinforced concrete be used? (concrete is more elastic than you think!)</em></li>
<li><em>Is pultruded form an option? (but how common is pultrusion as a production technology) </em></li>
<li><em>Is roll-forming using standard roll formers an option?</em></li>
<li><em>Is folding and pressing an option?</em></li>

No trusses


No beams


No purlins


No brackets


No fasteners


No perforations


No added bracing


No glue/welding/sealant


Just one new corrugated-profile sheet, flexed

 
This technolgy is perfect for disaster and low cost shelter:
Winter and tents don't mix so well:

Snapshot:
So this project is about creating a much better emergency shelter, which can also be used, (and reused) as a 3rd world, or refugee, housing alternative.

There is a need for really low cost shelter:

What starts a ""temporary"" often becomes near permanent:


What is needed is a really cheap form of shelter 
Insulated! so it is warmer in winter and cooler in summer ....
Immediately below is a CAD image of a shelter made from just one element.
If you look closely you will note the red sheets appear wider on the outside ..... Actually the red and grey sheets are locked together! Where they lock together forms a laminate ""compression tension"" arched beam.
This is Flex Mechanism at it simplest.

What I do
I develop ideas. It is my passion. It been a long journey, but I have learnt a bit along the way about how to turn ideas into working prototypes.
For example in 2011 I sold a technology called ""Flexloft"" to Nike USA:
 
But ideas mean a lot more if they do good.
I call this ""Design with Heart""
Recently I have been working on a new approach to building which is very simple. It is ideal for shelter and housing for those who need it most.

It can also (later) be developed for simple bridges, dams, and water tanks.


This project can save and improve lives
Ideas mean nothing .... To turn ideas into SOLUTIONS needs time and money.
Yep ..... Ideas mean nothing-zippo-nada .... unless they deliver. I want to really attack this project and I need your help.

 
Ok .... Lets get technical for a moment:
Have you ever tried to crush an egg in your hand? It can be done, but the humble egg does quite well in the ""Man vs Egg"" test.
Actually an egg can survive 50 to 90lb of force:



Yes curves are very strong, but we usually build with straight lines. But once upon a time we built more with curves:

Indeed we still use arches in elegant and strong ways today:

 
So how about using arches for cheap shelter and housing?
If you want to have a quick simple building one can use the strength and simplicity of an arch with common ole corrugated iron ....

OK so lets use the power of the arch and corrugated iron to make simple affordable structures....
But there is one more thing needed here. It is a simple thing. It is the ""mechanical glue"" that makes this work. To illustrate the principle grab two plastic rulers:



Seperate them at each end by a finger so they are roughly parallel.


Bend them!


What happens?
The centers move close together .... and if something is the middle the rulers will trap it via a distributed friction force!
Now what if the rulers were a lot stornger, and connected at the edges ..... You could have a U shape ruler, or an S or H crossection .... bend the shape now and the closure will still happen.
Pretty simple eh! But great design often lives in simplicity. 
 
Ok, technogogy over ....
I need your help to refine this technology and create a shelter solution ready to use:
One thing I have learnt in the last decade or so is that you have to design with purpose.
The end user really matters whether it is a sneaky improvement to a golf club, or a quick and safe shelter for earthquake survivors in a remote mountainous area in Central Asia.
So for emergency shelter we have to pay attention to ALL of the following:

Cheap, and
Using local technologies if possible, and 
Portable, and
Safe, and
Super easy to assemble, with minimal tools, and no English language requirement!




Yep, I need financial assistance to make this happen, but i am aware some people reading this will also have a great mix of skills and passion, for this project, so you can also help with your time:


Teamwork:
Great design is part inspiration and part perspiration, and a lot of persistence!

Teamwork here folks! If you have a passion and skill for CAD design, prototyping, detailed research, and dangerous thinking then send me an email simon@kiwipatents.com and I will advise you of a discussion blog which will be set up to start dialog.
Thanks Simon

If you really want to understand more about the project scope, and have a lot of time! .....read below .... 
Appendix: Project Overview
For those of you who want a sense of the things that need to be done here following is an overview. This is not a tight sequential list, but merely scoping a list of things to work through:
1. Current Status

Technical samples to hand & 
Some understanding of the wish list for emergency shelter &
Moving now to larger forms &
Testing ways of making S and H connectors for corrugated sheet.
2. What do aid agencies need?

Contact key aid agencies to better understand what is ideal.
Review current solutions, and problems ....
Research transport issues and limits.
Research production technologies available in the key geographical areas of Asia, Middle East, Africa, the Pacific, and 
Conduct historical research on issues found in past emergencies, and third world crises.
3. What is the best technology to use?

Extruded plastic/fiber-reinforced plastic/aluminum/other?
Can fiber reinforced concrete be used? (concrete is more elastic than you think!)
Is pultruded form an option? (but how common is pultrusion as a production technology) 
Is roll-forming using standard roll formers an option?
Is folding and pressing an option?
Is thermo forming, (possibly with folding) an option?
What other production technologies are there?
How practical is it to make the sheet with the connector integral?
In the case of insulating twin layer structure what is the best buffer layer to use to separate the beam elements by say 2""
What processes are options for creating the arch .... what may be the sequence of assembly ""on site""?
What alloys of steel are more elastic, and what are their costs and availability worldwide?
Is the traditional corrugation the best form anyway? .... is a flat form with plywood an alternative?
What end wall connectors are needed? .... Can things available now be used?????
What is the effect of the use of occasional polycarbonate sheets for lighting?
Is a chimney needed? ....and what are flashing and engineering considerations here?
How modular can parts be ....for extension as needed
How practically robust are parts for disassembly, transport, and reuse elsewhere?
..... others questions will arise!
4. Create working samples
Depending on feedback and factors above .....

A roof
A building 
An emergency shelter
A water tank
A small bridge
A small dam
A small house
Consult with engineers along the way (It is my hope we can save costs by crowd engineering here!)
Note: Whilst there are many options, and applications it is best to focus. What is the greatest pain and the greatest gain .... then focus on that. So whilst the above seven applications are very valid it will be best to work on them in time .... not all at once!
5. Other

Consider how you spread knowledge that this solution is available?
Is there are famous person who can be a champion for this in the media?
How simple and intuitive can the assembly be - can the parts be designed to be only able to be assembled in one (correct) way.
How few tools can be needed? none!? one?
Is a ""Factory in a Can"" an option for the third world? ... If so .... who to partner with to investigate with, and make this happen?
6. Test Production
Make, or more likely organize the making of, all parts needed ....

<p> This allows us to deliver our timepieces at less than <strong>$400 which is a fraction of their $1199</strong> normal retail price, worth far more than you will pledge and 

that will appreciate in value over time. </p>
<p>The timepiece is <strong>limited edition</strong> and has some features you will not find on any other watch on the market. Take advantage of the offer while it is here for 

this short period of time.</p>
<p>__________________________________________________________</p>
<p><strong>Though   time is fleeting</strong>, each carefully crafted Égard timepiece becomes a   constant reminder to <strong>be thankful for these wondrous moments</strong> 

and to look   forward to the future. </p>

<p>In   our process to come up with the<strong> infinite scale of time</strong>, we came up with   the idea to put <strong>authentic asteroid dust</strong> on the dial. Each 

limited   edition passages watch comes with dusted asteroid (some of the most   primitive material in the universe) on the dial so you can walk around with a piece of the universe on 

your wrist. </p>

<p>The entire vision of this watch came about by a <strong>chance encounter</strong> with <strong>William Shatner. Casper Van Dien</strong>, an ambassador of the <strong>Egard 

Brand</strong>, was followed by William Shatner on Twitter. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://agency20.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Bill_casper.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>When Mr. Shatner saw the Egard timepiece on Casper, he immediately wanted to own some of our timepieces.</p>
<p>Mr.   Shatner enjoyed wearing our timepieces and requested to meet with   Casper and I.  We spent well over an hour <strong>discussing horology</strong>, <strong>time, the   

universe and family</strong>. There was a strong connection because of my    intensity to what some might call an obsession with time: Mr.   Shatner related to it.<br/></p>
<p>We   discussed the <strong>meaning of time passing as we age</strong>,  and the few true   moments that reflect a good life,  <strong>moments not to be wasted.</strong></p>
<p>It was that same philosophy that<strong> inspired me to make my first watch</strong> for my father. <strong>My father</strong> (seen below wearing a timepiece I made for him) 

is the <strong>inspiration and motivativation</strong> behind my company. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://agency20.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/my_dad.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Sometime later Mr. Shatner reached out to  me to discuss how to bring our mutual vision to reality. </p>
<p>From   our initial meeting, it quickly grew into many sessions of us sitting   around discussing what the watch could be, <strong>sketching out ideas</strong> and   

discussing what was important to him in a watch from both a functional   standpoint and a personal standpoint. </p>

<p>What   resonated most was  <strong>""The passages of time""</strong>, Mr. Shatner’s idea that   represents the <strong>valued moments in time</strong>, for himself his 

family and   <strong>generations to come. </strong></p>
<p>We wanted to create a timepiece for others to share in the philosophy and <strong>experience with us</strong>...</p>

<p>Bill and I embarked on a <strong>YEAR  LONG JOURNEY</strong> to build his signature timepiece to be <strong>dedicated to his  grandchildren</strong> and signifying the passages of 

time. Through the year, we  created more than just a watch. We created a piece of <strong>mechanical artwork</strong> that  you can wear on your wrist signifying the passage of time…

Formed as a vision of a timepiece that is more than simply a watch,   but a true MECHANICAL WORK OF ART (no battery, works entirely based off the 

movement of your wrist.)

 

BY POPULAR
DEMAND: Woman’s Passages Beauté

As many women were asking about a woman’s version of the
timepiece, including Bill’s wife and daughter, by popular demand we are proud
to introduce the Woman’s Passages Beauté:








The “Passages” Limited Edition watch was created by William Shatner  in collaboration with myself, Ilan Srulovicz, the founder of Egard Watch 

Company.
A combination of both of our visions as to what a timepiece should be.
GET A SNEAK PEAK  AT BILL'S FIRST REACTION TO SEEING THE PROTOTYPE!



Before   we get too far, we would like thank you and the community of fans for   allowing us to do something unprecedented in the watch industry. 
By   bringing this project to IndieGoGo and directly to you, we can cut out   distributors and retailers, as well as additional marketing expenses. 



 This allows us to deliver our timepieces at less than $400 which is a fraction of their $1199 normal retail price, worth far more than you will pledge and 

that will appreciate in value over time. 
The timepiece is limited edition and has some features you will not find on any other watch on the market. Take advantage of the offer while it is here for 

this short period of time.
__________________________________________________________
Though   time is fleeting, each carefully crafted Égard timepiece becomes a   constant reminder to be thankful for these wondrous moments 

and to look   forward to the future. 



In   our process to come up with the infinite scale of time, we came up with   the idea to put authentic asteroid dust on the dial. Each 

limited   edition passages watch comes with dusted asteroid (some of the most   primitive material in the universe) on the dial so you can walk around with a piece of the universe on 

your wrist. 


The entire vision of this watch came about by a chance encounter with William Shatner. Casper Van Dien, an ambassador of the Egard 

Brand, was followed by William Shatner on Twitter. 

When Mr. Shatner saw the Egard timepiece on Casper, he immediately wanted to own some of our timepieces.
Mr.   Shatner enjoyed wearing our timepieces and requested to meet with   Casper and I.  We spent well over an hour discussing horology, time, the   

universe and family. There was a strong connection because of my    intensity to what some might call an obsession with time: Mr.   Shatner related to it.
We   discussed the meaning of time passing as we age,  and the few true   moments that reflect a good life,  moments not to be wasted.
It was that same philosophy that inspired me to make my first watch for my father. My father (seen below wearing a timepiece I made for him) 

is the inspiration and motivativation behind my company. 

Sometime later Mr. Shatner reached out to  me to discuss how to bring our mutual vision to reality. 
From   our initial meeting, it quickly grew into many sessions of us sitting   around discussing what the watch could be, sketching out ideas and   

discussing what was important to him in a watch from both a functional   standpoint and a personal standpoint. 
(screenshot from my initial realization of the watch in 3D)

What   resonated most was  ""The passages of time"", Mr. Shatner’s idea that   represents the valued moments in time, for himself his 

family and   generations to come. 
We wanted to create a timepiece for others to share in the philosophy and experience with us...

Bill and I embarked on a YEAR  LONG JOURNEY to build his signature timepiece to be dedicated to his  grandchildren and signifying the passages of 

time. Through the year, we  created more than just a watch. We created a piece of mechanical artwork that  you can wear on your wrist signifying the passage of time…


However, we both realized that we envisioned a watch  that was unique, but would also have to be extremely functional. 
Watch specifications:

Limited Edition (official William Shatner watch)
316L 45mm ""oblong"" case
 Dial dusted with 100 percent authentic asteroid  dust
3D multi layered, multi textured dial with  carbon fiber and open heart to showcase the movement

 Exhibition sapphire crystal caseback showcasing  the movement
Caseback engraved with Mr. Shatners signature and  number of the watch

 3 year warranty


The box set edition is an indiegogo EXCLUSIVE. It comes with everything listed above as well as a specially made watch winder (perfect for this automatic timepiece) 

which will retail for $150 USD. As well as a limited edition print. The Steel Bracelet and the Textured Leather Band showcased in the images below (as well as tools to change it). 

Additional USB footage and more. 
*JUST TO NOTE, WE WILL ASK YOUR COLOR PREFERENCE AT THE END OF THE CAMPAIGN



100% of the funds will be used for the first round of the  Egard Passages production. After more than a year of conceptualizing, designing  and manufacturing fully working 

prototypes we are ready to move forward!

All the work is done, we have our prototypes and are ready  to produce the watches! The timepieces should be ready to be shipped by February/March.
DON’T WORRY! WE WILL HAVE A SPECIAL GIFT FOR YOU FOR CHRISTMAS TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE SOMETHING UNDER THE TREE.

The collection has taken over a year to design and prototype.

First was the need for pouches, sleeves and padded covers for various gadgets that we have that were usable, washable and fun.  I then decided to blend it in with my passion in life, quilting and collecting fabric. I have always loved needlework. I’ve called myself a quilter for the last 18 years and have been working on various forms of needlework since the age of 7. I love to collect beautiful fabrics and sit and stare at them with hopes of grandeur of making quilts, GadgetGear, and amazing dog collars for various projects for people!<br/><p></p> <p></p> <p> </p><h3></h3><h3>Why I need your help</h3><p>When I started this adventure, it was a hobby/extra money thing. The extra money helped to fill in a few holes but it wasn't a full time job. As the business began to get larger, I discovered I wasn't going to be able to just run down to the sewing store and pick up a yard of batting or use whatever thread was on sale. I have businesses interested in carrying my items, but they need a larger amount that I am capable of making without start up funds. I am also the wife of a disabled Army Veteran.  Although he has graduated college, he is having a very hard time finding a job that does not discriminate him having his service dog, Charlie. So for the moment, my little business is filling in the gaps that his small disability doesn't cover.</p><p>The money raised here will help cover the costs of purchases of things such as </p><p></p><ul>

First was the need for pouches, sleeves and padded covers for various gadgets that we have that were usable, washable and fun.  I then decided to blend it in with my passion in life, quilting and collecting fabric. I have always loved needlework. I’ve called myself a quilter for the last 18 years and have been working on various forms of needlework since the age of 7. I love to collect beautiful fabrics and sit and stare at them with hopes of grandeur of making quilts, GadgetGear, and amazing dog collars for various projects for people!   Why I need your helpWhen I started this adventure, it was a hobby/extra money thing. The extra money helped to fill in a few holes but it wasn't a full time job. As the business began to get larger, I discovered I wasn't going to be able to just run down to the sewing store and pick up a yard of batting or use whatever thread was on sale. I have businesses interested in carrying my items, but they need a larger amount that I am capable of making without start up funds. I am also the wife of a disabled Army Veteran.  Although he has graduated college, he is having a very hard time finding a job that does not discriminate him having his service dog, Charlie. So for the moment, my little business is filling in the gaps that his small disability doesn't cover.The money raised here will help cover the costs of purchases of things such as 

Rolls of batting and yards of interfacing.


1"" polypro webbing and 3/8"" black heavy nylon webbing.


Fabrics: fat quarters, layered cakes, charm packs and yardage.


High quality threads.


Needles for my machine.


Buckles, triglides, and keepers.

Service for my Bernina.

For the cost of one of my single fabric camera straps, I will make you a custom patchwork camera strap, totally original, never made again.    What happens next As soon as I receive the funds I will purchase the ""ingredients,"" get my machine serviced, sign up for the QuiltCon Classes and get started making amazing, original pieces! All of the money raised here will go directly to these supplies, not my time, just the basic supplies.

I wanted to create something to help relieve some of the misery and danger. Like the person you see trying to save his house with a garden hose or the family who has to evacuate and can only hope their house will be OK and then come back to find it's burned to the ground. </p><ul>
<li>I came up with a simple inexpensive tool I've tested several times in a wind tunnel lab and refined it with the results from those indoor tests. It is now patent pending and requires one more final step of outdoor testing that I have set up with a Nationally Recognized Testing Facility in Washington state. </li>
<li>I am trying to raise funding for that testing. The product is a thin flat tool pictured above with a very specific design that  when laid out will slow and repeatedly suppress very large flames down to almost zero. This final outdoor testing will validate that claim and provide a launching point for marketing.</li>
<li>   It was specifically created from material  capable of taking on repeatedly the excessive heat of wildfire @ 2000° F. The pattern forces a fire to work harder and harder as it progresses forward through the design pushed by the wind.  No water, chemicals, electricity or mechanical equipment or human interaction is required for the design to work properly. You simply place it over shrubs, lawns or anywhere a fire will make its approach to a structure on the ground.</li>
<li>Here in So. California wildfire is a yearly fact of life as it is around the world; no one wants to be caught in it, and yet many are with few options. All too often the aftermath is devastating. I believe like an earthquake kit; if you are prepared with this product it can help save homes because it is so easy to setup before evacuating. It requires 1 minute to set 1 in place. Imagine a physical barrier a large 15' high fire cannot get past without being significantly degraded to less than 1 foot high. It may sound unrealistic,  but this testing will prove it. </li>

By taking 3-5 minutes a defensible fire line can be rolled out allowing a homeowner the ability to choose where to fight a fire as it approaches a property. That ability to slow a fire and degrade it is something everyone who has experienced any loss due to fire wishes they had available to them. The only thing stopping a person from buying a product like this is the proof it does work and the the knowledge of where to buy it.</p><p>On my web site I have included 2 videos I put on Youtube for your review. Although the video does not show the final design that came out of the testing it does show the idea does work. From the video showing the pattern being burned a second time you can see smoke starting up at the end of the test where the fire was starving from lack of oxygen being pulled down through the holes of the pattern fast enough to maintain the height of the flames. The final testing will also be using a secondary patent design implemented after the testing which will be even more effective driving the remaining flames  under a piece of material where extinguishing a flame is made much easier.  Taking a flame of 15' high down to almost zero within 10 feet.</p><p>I think that is an incredible claim and I hope you do also?</p><p>With this tool a fire can be directed, slowed and reduced in size adding safety and providing a barrier which a fire cannot pass through without being significantly suppressed. It is also reusable which will be one of the tests being run to show it is capable of being burned 3 times and still not degrade or destroy the material.</p><p>What can you do if a fire is coming toward your home except call the fire department and evacuate? Imagine taking 5 minutes to save everything you own, and not have to be there for it to work. </p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</span></p> <p> The risks involved are few with this product. I've proven twice the same material can handle temperatures over 1423° F. The material is rated for 2000° F. The risk I see with this idea are far outweighed by the potential for saving a home, barn, corral etc and all its possessions. The main risk as a homeowner is putting the tool down where a fire will not contact it causing a fire to go around it. The solution for that is to have enough on hand.  A good risk is to have paid the money for the product and never have use it. I have spoken with patent attorneys, many fire departments and testing facilities who all say its a good idea. The main challenge at this point is proving it and making the product known. The second challenge will be large scale marketing and setting up production with more capital investment required. Hopefully with the results of this testing I can come back to Indiegogo to ask for capital after providing proof from this testing of how well it did perform.  </p><p></p> <p> </p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">I've begun making several to be given out to places as a display item to start a conversation in areas that have been involved with a wildfire.

<p><strong>Blings</strong> are the world's first illuminated shoes that will interact with your iPhone or Android device.  The idea was to bring together the elements of style, functionality and technology into a coherent product that you can wear anywhere and stand out. </p>
<p>Blings are perfect for noisy environments where you can't hear your phone ring and when you can't feel it vibrate in your pocket or purse.  Never miss a call or text message again!</p>
<p>Blings are also perfect for jogging or cycling at night where lighted shoes will provide higher visibility for increased safety.</p>
<p><strong>HOW THEY WORK</strong>:</p>
<p>How they work video located here:  <a href=""http://youtu.be/6i7QSloZoHY?hd=1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://youtu.be/6i7QSloZoHY?hd=1</a></p>
<p>To communicate with your Blings, simply pair them with your device via Bluetooth, then download and install the free app and you're ready to go.</p>
<p>Once you've launched the App, it will give you several options on how to control your Blings.  For example, by pressing the ""ON"" button, all the lights in your Blings will be activated.  Your Blings are equipped with blue LEDs in the heel and orange EL (Electroluminescent) lighting along the sides.</p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt=""Blings illuminated interactive shoes"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i71.photobucket.com/albums/i125/vwongplay/Blings%20Shoes/shoe-1ksdescriptionsm_zps39ec94e5.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p>The next option in the App is to have your Blings flash by itself.  There are several presets provided and you can cycle through them using the preset button.</p>
<p>You can select the Audio button and your Blings will react to incoming audio such as music or even when you are walking.</p>
<p>However, one of the coolest features of your Blings is its ability to alert you when you get a call or text.  The alert feature can be used in conjunction with any of the other options or by itself.  When you receive a call, the blue lights will flash continuously until you pick up or the phone stops ringing.  However, if you get a text message, the blue light will flash the word ""TEXT"" in Morse code three times.</p>

<p>Your Blings are constructed of the highest quality materials including an all leather upper section.  The EL lighting is extremely flexible and waterproof.  The LED lights are embedded into the sole of the shoe, making your Blings very durable and capable of being worn daily.</p>
<p>Your Blings are equipped with an electronic brain located inside the tongue of the shoe and is easily accessible by pulling apart the Velcro lip.  The battery is located on the brain and can be replaced within a minute or two and should last for months or years depending on use.  The brain can be removed entirely if you desire to wash your Blings. </p>
<p>For those of you without an iPhone or Android device, don't fret.  We have added a push button switch on the brain to allow you to select various functions and presets for your Blings so that you may enjoy them also.</p>

A lot of us can relate to the situations when our things got crashed or stolen. Moreover, the news on TV puts more pressure on our everyday lives. However, the problem is not that we are facing some physical or material damage, but the feelings of stress, powerlessness, and disorder, which start to pursue us from the moment it happens. This is what led us to develop WonderShell protection technology for our future backpacks.What is it?The WonderShell was designed for a daily use. This backpack fulfills everyday urban needs, as well as keeps your gadgets and belongings safe from thefts or external impacts, hits, falls and even the most slippery thieves. Moreover, WonderShell Backpack is so durable, that it can serve you longer than any daily bag known before. We believe that things surrounding us are not only serving our daily needs, but determine the way we feel and how we go through every day. We believe every person deserves to feel safe, confident and be in control of their own lives. By combining effective protection technology, functionality, and design we created a backpack that can make people look, feel and live like a Superhero. First reviews of WonderShell backpack:""Travelers or commuters who might have concerns over their personal safety when out in the world might be interested in the 'WonderShell' shell backpacks. Boasting a bulletproof design, the 'WonderShell' backpack is designed to look like the shield of a superhero that sits comfortably and stylishly on your back.""""Coming with a superhero shield shape, the WonderShell Backpack has all the space you need for your laptop, tablet, devices, and gear.

 FeaturesMaterialsWe wanted to make WonderShell Safety Backpacks accessible to the audiences who have different lifestyles, therefore we decided to provide a wide choice of materials for the exterior design.WonderShell Backpack consists of front and back parts covered with different materials. The front part can be made of full leather, leather + fabric, fabric and sports fabric.We use calf skin leather in black and brown colors for Leather Designs of WonderShell.For the Fabric Designs, you can choose various options from newest collections: Dark Knight, Atlantis Celeste, and Canary Blue.The Limited Edition comes in finest Northern Reindeer Leather. Designed especially for this campaign, Reindeer Leather is like a good wine, since you only get a limited amount each year from a certain region of the world.  Back part always comes with a durable material, same as we use for the sport edition backpack.DurabilityThe materials covering the backpack are strongly attached to the sturdy base. This way WonderShell backpack serves you longer than any daily bag known before.   Antitheft ProtectionYou can access to WonderShell inside pockets only from a back part. Such location of zipper ensures that you have secured anti-theft protection for your belongings. Besides, due to the strong base of the backpack, the most slippery thieves would not be able even to cut their way inside your bag.Sturdy baseThe base of the backpack is made of strong fiberglass, that can withstand a huge pressure: more than 90 kg/sq.m (18.4p/sq.ft)It keeps your gadgets protected from impacts and a wide range of accidents.

When you wear this backpack, you will always have your personal bulletproof shield around for extraordinary situations.All gadgets inside are protected with a soft and durable foam material. So, in addition to the fiberglass shell, your belongings are protected from hitting each other or bumping into the shell.GabaritsThe WonderShell comes in two sizes regular and small. Inner PocketsInside you have special pockets for the gadgets, notebooks, smaller belongings and additional space for other things to fulfill your daily urban needs.

<h3>What is AotC?</h3>
<p>For anyone who's late joining the party The Art of the Con is a project J and I have been working on and building up to for a couple years now. Our official launch and grand opening was VegasCon this year, but we have so many plans for expansion throughout 2019.</p>
<p><strong>Who are Thrsday and J?</strong></p>
<p>We're 2 best friends who have booming social lives - complete with parties, perks, and an over abundance of karaoke, exhaustive travel itineraries and attractive bearded men - all the things one might wish for, but only 13 weekends out of the year.</p>
<p>During our many journeys back and forth across the country we've had so many ideas (mostly jokes we'd like to put on tshirts) and w<span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">ith over 50 cons between us we've learned a thing or two. AotC is us taking that experience and making it an experience for anyone to join in on. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""><strong>Phase II</strong></span></h3>

</div></div>","What is AotC?
For anyone who's late joining the party The Art of the Con is a project J and I have been working on and building up to for a couple years now. Our official launch and grand opening was VegasCon this year, but we have so many plans for expansion throughout 2019.
Who are Thrsday and J?
We're 2 best friends who have booming social lives - complete with parties, perks, and an over abundance of karaoke, exhaustive travel itineraries and attractive bearded men - all the things one might wish for, but only 13 weekends out of the year.
During our many journeys back and forth across the country we've had so many ideas (mostly jokes we'd like to put on tshirts) and with over 50 cons between us we've learned a thing or two. AotC is us taking that experience and making it an experience for anyone to join in on. 
 
Phase II
Our grand opening at VegasCon 2019 was a great success and a huge learning experience. We have so many plans moving forward and into our next con, but there's products we'd like to expand to offer and equipment we need to get and after careful examination we just can't do that on our own. We started this off buttons and buttons alone and we're going forward with more button designs than ever, but we have so many ideas for stickers, tshirts, enamel pins, and a broader range of services to offer in addition to the cosplay rescue and other at con features that are in progress.
Perks & Funding Goals
We tried to offer a variety of perk options and will be adding more as the campaign continues as we reach milestones. New button designs will be released every other hundred hit and we'll start adding new sticker designs around $400, tshirts at $500. If we go past our goal of $1,000 we'll be launching ArtofCons.Com with a full web shop, commissions blog, and more.
This is our first time doing any major crowdfunding so we're not sure what to expect, we'll be doing this as flexibly as possible and however much or little is raised will go toward a variety of goals. Only some of which we've outlined here, in part to have some surprises in store, the other part is we're still discovering what we're capable of. Anyone who knows me though, knows I can take twenty bucks and a shoe string and turn it into something magical. I can do much more with a couple thousand dollars.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<div>Hi there! We're three students attending an entrepreneurial program at MIT out to change the way we think of fashion today. As young adults, our threads are our way of expressing ourselves at first glance, but our clothes today are just a reflection of some designer after being diluted by department stores. We're frustrated by the lack of creativity in stores and excited to tap into the potential of aspiring designers worldwide. By supporting our campaign, you can help us put the power of fashion back in the hands of the people.</div>
<div>
<h3>Our Mission</h3>
<div>Fashion is an great area for outpourings of creative energy and personal empowerment. So we started CollabWear. <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">CollabWear is an online platform where designers can post their sketches, and members of the community can pre-order the garments. If a design gains enough pre-orders within a time frame, we send it off to be manufactured, and ship out the produced designs. We then take a commission off the profits, and give the rest to the designer. They’ve realized their design and the consumer takes home a product that expresses their individuality.<br/><br/><br/><h3>Our Product</h3>
<div><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">CollabWear is a platform for emerging designers to make their visions materialize in the market, as well as for fashionable customers to be able to choose the newest fashion trends at ease.</span></div>

<p>We've already forged some great relationships with the manufacturers we plan on working with. We're in the midst of contacting design schools to alert their students of opportunity we provide. Our next steps are to curate the designs we receive and post them to our site to make them available for pre-orders. </p>
</div>
<h3>Our Agenda</h3>
</div><div> <p>In order to pursue our idea, we need $10,000. Of this amount, we'll use $9,000 to hire a website developer to build our website to provide the best user experience possible and add features essential to maintaining the creative integrity of our users. The remaining $1,000 we will use to produce our initial designs with our manufacturers and market our platform to build a large design community.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Perks</h3>
<p>For contributing to our campaign, we'll send you some awesome rewards, including a trip to New York with a VIP Tour of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the chance to attend a ticketed talk by Alina Cho. We'll also send you some great CollabWear merchandise (t-shirt, stickers, sketchbooks) and handwritten notes stamped with our eternal gratitude. </p>

ARE WE?</b></b></b></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>We are two passionate Industrial
Designers, who have an interest in unique watches.  Outside of our normal jobs in the design
industry in Sydney, Australia we spend time coming up with new ideas and designs. Our dedication and passion to the subject is why we are here. </p>
<p>As Industrial designers, we love
product design. Unfortunately many of our ideas do not go any further from a simple
sketch on a napkin. With Indiegogo we now have this opportunity to present our
ideas, albeit refined and ready for the next stage in the design process.</p>
<p>You the contributors will get our
ideas of the ground. You alone will allow us to achieve our goals of making our
ideas functional and accessible to the wider audience. In-turn providing you
with the opportunity to own some of our great product ideas.</p>
<p><b>WHAT
ARE WE DESIGNING?</b></p>
<p>Our first
project is a minimalist wrist watch named ‘Uno’. After
months of sketching, deliberating, CAD modelling and some frustrations, we have
arrived at what we believe is something unique and worthy of manufacturing.</p>
<p>We have a particular interest in the
oversized watch industry. These watches speak form. We have followed through

ARE WE?


We are two passionate Industrial
Designers, who have an interest in unique watches.  Outside of our normal jobs in the design
industry in Sydney, Australia we spend time coming up with new ideas and designs. Our dedication and passion to the subject is why we are here. 
As Industrial designers, we love
product design. Unfortunately many of our ideas do not go any further from a simple
sketch on a napkin. With Indiegogo we now have this opportunity to present our
ideas, albeit refined and ready for the next stage in the design process.
You the contributors will get our
ideas of the ground. You alone will allow us to achieve our goals of making our
ideas functional and accessible to the wider audience. In-turn providing you
with the opportunity to own some of our great product ideas.
WHAT
ARE WE DESIGNING?
Our first
project is a minimalist wrist watch named ‘Uno’. After
months of sketching, deliberating, CAD modelling and some frustrations, we have
arrived at what we believe is something unique and worthy of manufacturing.
We have a particular interest in the
oversized watch industry. These watches speak form. We have followed through
with a large form factor, which blends minimalism, with a shape that is unique
yet subtle-that can be enjoyed by a wider audience
In addition we have envisioned the watch
in high quality materials, with a great quality finish and interesting colour
combinations.
Ultimately our goal is to bring this
piece to market at a costs that can make it affordable to anyone. 
We hope to have the production watch offered in the colours below:


Colour variations
















Final conceptual packaging (white face with black hands and red seconds hand)

WHY
DO WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT?
By backing the first stage of our
project we will be able to fully analyse and test a working prototype that will
lead to a product that we will be able to produce in a limited production run;
at a reasonable and attractive cost to you via a second crowd funding campaign.
The more money we can raise for a
prototype the more we can spend on refining manufacturing and testing different
materials for the overall finish, as well as offering all colour configurations
in production. We can also drive the cost of the final unit down by getting an idea of final quantities through the funding of this campaign.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello there!</p>
<p>I first want to thank you for checking out my project. It means a lot to even check out the page. Second, i would like to tell you a little about this project aside from the video above.</p>
<p>This project is my passion; it’s what I want as my career. Before college and high school, I had a thing for the arts. Design runs through me, I love to design! Anything and everything. When it started to come down to it, I had to eventually narrow it down to something. I narrowed it down to fashion design. Right now I am very much focused on fashion. I love to design clothing, women wear to be exact. I have my sketchbook full of fashion doodles and little notes and my dream and goal was to have those designs brought to life. My dreams become my goals, and my goals are my dreams. When that happens, I try every which way to achieve it or at least <em>try</em> to achieve it. I want to share my passion for fashion  to the world. Owning my own fashion line would mean the world to me, and if you could make that happen. well, let's just say karma will reward you as well as i am too. I know each of you have at least one thing that means the world to you. Whether it be family, a soul-mate, a goal, or a dream. I’m just asking you, to reach out a hand and help make my dream come true.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
What your money, every penny, will do is to help me complete the first steps of creating a line. Your money, weather i make my goal, go over, or fall short,  will go toward creating my designs. Having them come to life. The amount of money i raise here on this project profile will define how many designs i can actual get made and brought to life. i will also have a professional portfolio created in time, so i can show all the designs to manufactures, buyers, &amp; stores. so i wont have just one location that you can buy my designs at...</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Every gift of money desereves a reward. so i have presented a few gifts to all the donaters &amp; backers. as these are just the beginning steps of creating the line, i am limited to what i can give as a reward. depending on your donation amount, you are able to get a thank you from me in a form of online, in a video, in a handmade card written and designed by me, a photo print of one of the designs from the line, or a beautiful bracelet thats designed by me and handmade by a local artist.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>...and believe me, the bracelet is SO worth the donating! i actually kind of want one for myself, haha.</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
My designs are meant to compliment the woman's body as well as give her a great sense of style and class. My designs are primarily for the sophisticated and classy type of women (i am at the moment, working on designs for a line for young females). EVERY FEMALE SHOULD FEEL SEXY! Sexy in my book means knowing what fits &amp; compliments your body and showing off the right curves and not the wrong ones. More skin shown isn't the sexy you should aim for, if you want to be taken seriously as well as attract the right type of guys, you should show the right curves and cover the right amount. Less is not always more.</div>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I hope you take the time to consider donating to my project, it will really mean a lot to me! if you can't donate, do not worry! just share about this and spread the word! the more people that know about this, the better. if you have any comments, concerns, or questions, please DO NOT hesitate to ask! i will be glad to answer your questions and hear your comments!</p>

We have big plans for Lick My Sack©. We can expand our menu to include BURGERS, NACHOS, PIZZA...the opportunities are endless. By simply adding 1 ingredient to an existing food item, we create a whole new range of possibilities for customers.
Our plan is to expand beyond selling online and to introduce Lick My Sack© Kiosks. These kiosks will allow visitors to the hottest street wear stores to build their backpack, order and pay right there in-store.This is our marketing initiative to appeal to those we may not have reached online and to give ourselves a physical and interactive presence as well.

Why $4,000?

After expenses including: Indiegogo fees, PayPal fees & manufacturing, the profits will be put towards the creation of our first kiosk. This first kiosk will allow us to provide demonstrations for interested street wear stores, as well as being used for marketing and promotional purposes. See our budget breakdown of the profits to see how this will all come together.



What if we exceed $4,000?


That would be bloody fantastic. Below is a breakdown of what we can achieve at different levels if the campaign was to be more successful than anticipated. It's important to remember that the figures below are before expenses.




What if you don't hit the target?


If we can't reach our $4,000 target, we will still be able to use whatever money raised for marketing at a smaller scale. At the very least, we would have (with your help) spread the word of Lick My Sack© and have made a start towards getting our first kiosk.What You Get

<p>On July 23, 2015 <a href=""http://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-kepler-mission-discovers-bigger-older-cousin-to-earth"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">NASA publicly announced</a> the revolutionary discovery of Kepler-452b, an exoplanet known as Earth's bigger, older cousin or ""Earth 2,"" which orbits a star much like the sun. 
</p>
<p>We began our second watch series with a simple idea: to combine design, typeface, and mechanism within a watch. Inspired by this recent space discovery, the Series K452 was born.</p>

<p>The Series K452's disc system contains a 3-layer surface from inner to outer discs, graduated for seconds, minutes, and hours respectively. </p>
<p>As shown below, a reference point is engraved from the top of the watchface to its center so you can read time perpendicularly. The seconds are marked out in the center disc. The minute and hour discs are read through an aperture with a single engraved line at the top of the watch. <br/></p>

<h1>Table of Contents</h1>
<p>The sections below break down the Series K452's features in detail. Here is a quick overview. </p>
<ul>
<li><b>No battery necessary </b></li>
<li><b>Powered by Miyota Calibre 9015 </b></li>
<li><b>Transparent case back </b></li>
<li><b>316L stainless steel body </b></li>
<li><b>Milanese mesh bracelet </b></li>
<li><b>Genuine leather straps </b></li>
<li><b>3 color planet buttons </b></li>
<li><b>Smart docking system</b></li>
<li><b>One size fits all </b></li>
<li><b>Convex hard plexiglass + Anti-Reflective coating + Sapphire coating<br/></b></li>
<li><b>Original typeface</b></li>
<li><b>Exclusive telescopic auto winder </b></li>
<li><b>Laser-engraved astronaut badge</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<h1>Motion Powered by You</h1>
<p>The Series K452 requires <b>no battery</b>. </p>
<p>It does not need to be wound, but winds itself as you move. Alternatively, you can wind it by turning the crown clockwise. When you wear the watch, your natural movements keep the watch running; you are its power source!</p>

<br/>
<h1><b>Planetary Accuracy</b></h1>
<p>The Series K452 is driven by a <b>Miyota Calibre 9015</b>, a high grade and high frequency model that allows for smooth spinning with great accuracy. Offering slim dimensions and long preserved running time, the Miyota Calibre 9015 is known as one of the highest quality automatic movement motors.</p>
<ul>
<li>Vibration frequency: 28800 vibrations per hour </li>
<li>24 Jewels automatic movement </li>
<li>Accuracy: -10~30 seconds per day </li>
<li>Posture difference: Under 40 seconds per day </li>
<li>Running Time: More than 42 hours </li>
<li>Water resistance: 164' (50 m)</li>
</ul>
<p>*<i>Accuracy of a mechanical watch is different from the daily rate accuracy of a quartz watch. The accuracy will change at a maximum of ten seconds when you manually rewind the spring. Therefore, accuracy of the half wound condition (as the watch naturally unwinds throughout the week) will be different from that of fully wound condition.</i></p>
<h1><b>A Planet, Discovered</b></h1>
<p>The Series K452 also contains a <b>transparent case back</b>–a unique feature among timepieces. The case back represents the discovery of the Kepler-452b, showing how this world that was hidden within our galaxy has now been found.</p>

Launch
On July 23, 2015 NASA publicly announced the revolutionary discovery of Kepler-452b, an exoplanet known as Earth's bigger, older cousin or ""Earth 2,"" which orbits a star much like the sun. 

We began our second watch series with a simple idea: to combine design, typeface, and mechanism within a watch. Inspired by this recent space discovery, the Series K452 was born.

Series K452. 3 models.
A Wearable Solar System 

In the early 1600s, Johannes Kepler proposed three laws regarding the mechanics behind orbital movements, and his discoveries lead to our contemporary understanding of planetary movement.
The K452 Series pays homage to these discoveries, displaying the relationship between time and space through concentric discs.

The Series K452's disc system contains a 3-layer surface from inner to outer discs, graduated for seconds, minutes, and hours respectively. 
As shown below, a reference point is engraved from the top of the watchface to its center so you can read time perpendicularly. The seconds are marked out in the center disc. The minute and hour discs are read through an aperture with a single engraved line at the top of the watch. 









Table of Contents
The sections below break down the Series K452's features in detail. Here is a quick overview. 

No battery necessary 
Powered by Miyota Calibre 9015 
Transparent case back 
316L stainless steel body 
Milanese mesh bracelet 
Genuine leather straps 
3 color planet buttons 
Smart docking system
One size fits all 
Convex hard plexiglass + Anti-Reflective coating + Sapphire coating
Original typeface
Exclusive telescopic auto winder 
Laser-engraved astronaut badge



Motion Powered by You
The Series K452 requires no battery. 
It does not need to be wound, but winds itself as you move. Alternatively, you can wind it by turning the crown clockwise. When you wear the watch, your natural movements keep the watch running; you are its power source!






Planetary Accuracy
The Series K452 is driven by a Miyota Calibre 9015, a high grade and high frequency model that allows for smooth spinning with great accuracy. Offering slim dimensions and long preserved running time, the Miyota Calibre 9015 is known as one of the highest quality automatic movement motors.

Vibration frequency: 28800 vibrations per hour 
24 Jewels automatic movement 
Accuracy: -10~30 seconds per day 
Posture difference: Under 40 seconds per day 
Running Time: More than 42 hours 
Water resistance: 164' (50 m)

*Accuracy of a mechanical watch is different from the daily rate accuracy of a quartz watch. The accuracy will change at a maximum of ten seconds when you manually rewind the spring. Therefore, accuracy of the half wound condition (as the watch naturally unwinds throughout the week) will be different from that of fully wound condition.
A Planet, Discovered
The Series K452 also contains a transparent case back–a unique feature among timepieces. The case back represents the discovery of the Kepler-452b, showing how this world that was hidden within our galaxy has now been found.









The Spacecraft
The Series K452 is equipped with a bold 316L stainless steel body, reminiscent of the spacecraft itself, available in 3 stunning models, which you can choose from during the survey process. 






Convex hard Plexiglass with Anti-reflective coating + Sapphire coating
316L Stainless steel
Ø 1.65"" (42.0 mm)
Height 0.57"" (14.4 mm) back & screws

Secure Take Off
Embroidered by steel, the watch's Milanese mesh bracelet is a tribute to the airless tires of roving space vehicles and offers ultimate protection. The carefully fabricated Milanese mesh is stitched together in a delicate process involving up to 85 steps. 
This sophisticated mesh forms a metallic wave on the wrist, giving flexibility to the fit, allowing the skin to breathe freely. Unquestionably tough (it has been called “shark proof”) it is still versatile and light enough for everyday wear.

Offering precision, stability, and toughness all at once, the Milanese mesh bracelet is an ideal space suit for the Series K452.
There are 3 finishes available, which you will choose during the survey process.

     Brushed Milanese Mesh 
     Polished Milanese Mesh 
     DLC Matte Black Milanese Mesh
















Leather strap and planet buttons
Each Series K452 comes with your choice of a Milanese mesh bracelet, plus extra genuine leather straps with planet buttons. The leather straps also have a stainless steel buckle with PvD black plating.
Featuring the members of the discovered planets in Kepler’s neighborhood, the planet buttons come in 3 colors: red (Kepler-20e), yellow (Kepler-186f), and blue (Earth / Kepler 452b). 
Milanese mesh? Leather strap with 3-colored planets? Pick your spatial experience. 













Smart Docking 
To swap the straps, the Series K452 has an interchangeable strap system that secures straps with a simple pull and click. Within seconds straps can be changed and perfectly docked, ready for takeoff. The docking system is available for both Milanese mesh and leather straps, so you can choose what style fits you best. 













For Everyone
The Series K452 is designed for both men and women.
Simply slide the clasp to the desired slot to adjust the length of the bracelet so that it fits perfectly on your wrist.

We have performed several plexiglass hardness tests to measure the breaking energy of the Plexiglass under a simulated dropping impact. The material ensures incredible strength along with a magnificent view of the watch's mechanical universe.

<p>RISKS AND CHALLENGES</p>
<p>Our team has experience in product development, environmental business, e-commerce, and marketing. We've spent the last 14 months developing strong relationships with our manufacturers.  Design on our first frame style is finished. Our Ombraz Classic cord is finalized, and we have even run an initial production run of 300 units to test everything out. Two additional frame styles are in their final development stages and will be ready to launch this summer. We acknowledge that an unpredictable roadblock could happen, but we've traveled through a lot and are ready for it :)</p>
<p>After hand-sewning hundreds of pairs of Ombraz we've become intimately familiar with our product. We are in the process of testing out a scaled assembly process, using ultrasound to fuse our cord. We are determined to deliver a high-quality pair of sunnies that will enhance your eyewear experience and be the last kind of sunglasses you’ll ever buy.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, we have already started to develop our next 2 frame styles and they should launch by late summer 2018. They are looking beautiful! </p>
<p>Our initial focus will be on adapting Ombraz technology to other classic styles, adding a touch of Ombraz to each.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP</h3>
<p>During our campaign, every time you share us on your social pages, we will plant 1 tree on your behalf! Thank you all so much for the love! We can't wait to get a pair of Ombraz in your hands!</p>

When he discovered the running trails along the beaches of West Vancouver, he set out to buy the ultimate running jacket, but couldn’t find anything that came close. He wanted something versatile with modern, built-in features, that didn't compromise performance or comfort.With 20 years of experience as a producer and designer for women’s fashion brands across Europe, Kevin set out to create what he believes is the perfect running/activewear jacket for women AND men...enter the Merino Contour Jacket.The Magic of MerinoThe Merino Contour Jacket is made up of 85% pure Merino wool; a natural, renewable and biodegradable material that’s great for the environment, The natural fibres are lightweight, soft and breathable allowing you to perform in comfort. Merino adapts to your body temperature keeping you warm or cool all year round. A true no-fuss material, Merino wool is odour resistant, machine washable, and can be simply hung for a day to restore its freshness. With a much lower percentage of synthetic fibres than its competitors, our jacket focuses on the natural without sacrificing quality, performance and style. Comfort AND FunctionWorried about carrying too much stuff? Or not being able to carry what you need? Beat the bulk with secure inside pockets for your smartphone, keys and must-haves. Torn between wanting to be comfortable and wanting to look great? This jacket is perfectly detailed for comfort without compromising style.The jacket is loaded with fine details including:
self-sealing inside pockets for keys, cards or other valuables
glove-fitted sleeves
waterproof zippers
a microfibre cloth for your glasses

<p>This isn't our first rodeo, but there are always unknowns that can come up.</p>

<p>MANUFACTURING: We have dialed in the prototypes and love where they 
are at. We've become good friends with our manufacturer over the past 
few years and they have always delivered on quality and been able to be 
flexible with our needs for other sunglasses we produce. Nonetheless, 
challenges can arise, e.g. certain acetate colors could take a little 
extra time to procure. These guys only make high quality stuff and we 
accept nothing less.</p>
<p>FULFILLMENT: There are always things that could come up here. As you 
know, many Kickstarters deliver late. We've always delivered close to 
our deadlines and kept a hot line of communication between our backers 
and reality. Because we have a close relationship that has been built 
with our manufacturer over the past few years, we have the advantage of 
extra transparency. If the manufacturer misses a deadline, a shipment 
goes astray, or anything goes wrong, you'll hear about it right away.</p>

<h3 class=""Standard""><strong>The Project!</strong></h3>
<p class=""Standard"">I started working on the project because I wanted to make a bracelet for my girlfriend. She wears tight clothes and as you can imagine, she finds it inconvenient to keep coins in her pockets. Another problem was that the coins always fall out of her wallet and get scattered all over her purse. I wanted to save her these troubles and give her a reason to smile more often!</p>

Do you want your coins to be easily accessible, as well?

What is Ammo?
Ammo is a futuristic, plastic bracelet from a new generation. It was created for your convenience, so you could easily access your coins.
With Ammo you can forget about scattered coins all over your pockets!

 
The Project!
I started working on the project because I wanted to make a bracelet for my girlfriend. She wears tight clothes and as you can imagine, she finds it inconvenient to keep coins in her pockets. Another problem was that the coins always fall out of her wallet and get scattered all over her purse. I wanted to save her these troubles and give her a reason to smile more often!


We use coins every day for tickets, vending machines, shopping trolleys. I thought that Ammo would save us some time and nerves by keeping our coins easy too access whenever and wherever we need them.

And that's how the Ammo idea was born!



Where will my money go?

The product design and development are expensive, hard and time consuming. We are ready to take this challenge up but we need your help.
We need money for:
- Improving the material
- Improving the design 
- Minimum Order Quantities. Manufacturers require minimum quantities that must be paid before they run the products.


What is it made of ?
Ammo is made of flexible, nontoxic plastic.
 


Varieties
There are three different types of bracelets.
Ammo US



Ammo USA contains up to 28 US coins (all coins with diameter from 17.91mm to 30.61mm)


Ammo UK



Аmmo UK contains up to 28 British coins except for Twenty-five and Five pence (all coins  with diameter from 18mm to 28.4mm)


Ammo EU



Ammo US contains up to 28 EU coins (all coins with diameter from16.25mm to 25.75mm)

 
Dimensions:
There are three different sizes of bracelets.
S
Diameter: 80mmHeight: 28mm
M
Diameter: 96mmHeight: 28mm
L
Diameter: 100mmHeight: 28mm
 

What colors does it come in?

 



Manufacturing schedule:

October – last modifications
November – manufacturing
December – Quality check and product dispacth


Risks and challenges
International shipping is a great challenge as it is always hard to estimate the correct delivery date.
Ammo manufacturing will take place in an EU country, in a factory with proven quality. We will inform our customers if any unexpected delays occur during any of the manufacturing stages.

<p>Shotcaps combine traditional shot glasses and bottle caps into a single, unique product that allows you to cap your favorite liquor bottles! Stop wasting precious party time searching around your cluttered kitchen for that shot-glass-gone-rogue since now you'll have a fully functional shot glass attached atop your bottle.</p>
<p>The product was conceived, designed and developed by 24 year old, serial-entrepreneur Nathan 'Ello' Reimnitz of Minneapolis, MN.

<h3>Product Features...</h3>
<p>Let's face it, once in a while we all have a little too much fun at a party and glasses get dropped. Fortunately for you, our products are made of acrylic (not glass) which allows you to drop it as many times as you wish.</p>
<p>Our caps are manufactured using a non-flavor-transfer material which means when you pour your favorite drink in, it tastes like your favorite drink coming out (rather than tasting like plastic, yuck).</p>

We're looking for $10,000 to launch 3 products; a 1.5oz shot glass, a 3.0oz double-shot glass, and a 4.0oz mixed-shot glass.

durability;·  integrating technical design elements like forward-angle seams, slightly scooped necklines, elongated sleeve lengths, carefully measured shoulder slope and curved hemlines;·  translating hand-drawn artwork to garment embroidery;·  dipping and double-dipping different colorways for each fabric;·  rounds & rounds of sample revisions back and forth between our design team and our incredible manufacturing partners in Japan… and finally, we have our first collection!  We can't wait for you to try it on :)  We're a small team -- bootstrapped and women owned & operated -- with big plans for 2019.  By backing our campaign, you're helping us bring those plans and this brand to life.We started with a small collection of core styles, but we have a larger assortment in the product development pipeline that we're hoping to work on this year.  This is just the beginning of our inclusive-sizing effort -- we hope to carry everything we're learning about what you want in fabrics, patterns, and aesthetic toward concepting an entire assortment of styles specifically designed for our size range.We have a few more core styles that are in the sketch design phase.  We're particularly excited about working on a functional, comfy, flat-front waistband across a few different core bottoms styles, and on incorporating strategic paneling into tops and outerwear.    Product design and development are central to our goals in the immediate future.  Our longer-term vision is to complement an expanded assortment with an improved shopping experience, a closer integration with style inspiration + editorial content, and ongoing interaction with our community.           Customer feedback has been central to our product development thus far -- from our initial survey, to meeting some of you in person, to implementing your comments and opinions into every phase of the design process -- and our commitment to you is to maintain and improve upon that feedback loop throughout the coming months.Feel free to reach out at any time to support@wearori.com.  We are so excited to bring this brand to life, and we are *so* grateful for your support along the way ... this is just the beginning! wearori.com@wearori",34.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>I, Vaishali, started The Empowerment Bag because I'm passionate about stopping human trafficking. I was also looking for an affordable, sustainable, and ethically-made cross-body bag. I couldn't find such a product. I also didn't find a brand I trusted that provided a variety of bags to keep up with my varied activities and hectic lifestyle, so I decided to launch such a brand myself.</p>
<p>I've been involved with anti-trafficking projects since high school. When I attended Carleton College, I founded and led an anti-human trafficking task force. I was awarded a scholarship to work with the Cook County Adult Probation Sex Offender Unit and the Chicago Alliance Against Sexual Exploitation (CAASE). I also worked with the Australian Government Office for Women.</p>

<p>We're focused on developing great wearable products: things that a lot of people would wear all the time for a long time. Like jeans and t-shirts. We aim to pioneer the emerging world of wearables, by making products and services in the consumer health and fitness space to inspire people be more active and develop healthy habits. We were founded in 2011, and Misfit Shine is our first product.</p>
<h2>Why Indiegogo?</h2>
<p>Part of the idea behind the lean startup is to prove demand, and build products in a rapid, user-centered design cycle. By reaching out on Indiegogo, we can assess our demand, build a stronger relationship with our early adopters, and use feedback to make our product as amazing as possible.</p>
<h2>Use of Funds</h2>
<p>We've built our prototypes. We’ve figured out our supply chain. We need your help to take the next step. We’re looking for funds to put Misfit Shine into production. We know what we’re doing; we've led the development and manufacturing of more than a dozen hardware products in previous companies, including the first ever <a href=""Http://bit.ly/medroid"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">iPhone-compatible hardware medical device</a> - so we know exactly what's required to pull this off. You are getting in early, and getting a premium product ahead of everyone else.<br/><br/>We’re asking you to help us make Misfit Shine a reality.</p>

We're focused on developing great wearable products: things that a lot of people would wear all the time for a long time. Like jeans and t-shirts. We aim to pioneer the emerging world of wearables, by making products and services in the consumer health and fitness space to inspire people be more active and develop healthy habits. We were founded in 2011, and Misfit Shine is our first product.

Use of Funds
We've built our prototypes. We’ve figured out our supply chain. We need your help to take the next step. We’re looking for funds to put Misfit Shine into production.

<h1><strong>/// OUR STORY \\\</strong></h1> <p>Fiona O'Leary Sloan founded IARA (pronounced <i>yiah-rah</i>) in Detroit, Michigan in the summer of 2014 -- and is now hoping to take it full-time. Fiona lived in Rio de Janeiro in her early twenties and was inspired by the bright colors and fluid femininity of Rio's samba, surf, and conflicted heritage. Combining this inspiration with the beadweaving techniques traditionally employed by Native American artists in her home state of New Mexico, Fiona founded IARA in 2014 to unite these passions into beautiful, wearable artwork. She believes that everyone should own at least one handmade item, and seeks to make that dream a possibility through her artwork.</p>
<p>Where does the name IARA come from? The <em>iara</em> is a figure of Brazilian (specifically Tupi and Guaraní) mythology. The word, meaning ""lady of the lake"" or ""water queen,"" derives from the Old Tupi<em>yîara</em>: <em>y (water)</em> + <em>îara (lady)</em>. When portrayed in other cultures, the iara is usually represented as a siren, water nymph, or mermaid.</p>

If we can’t raise the money to match their grant by the end of 2014, our opportunity to receive this matching grant from the city of Oakland will be lost.Unfortunately the repairs and support we need extend far beyond Oakland’s grant. In order to truly build a thriving designer-friendly community space we need to invest in our future, and not just cover our current structural emergencies.The majority of the funds will be used to repair our physical space. Urban Stitch is located on the second floor of a historical building in Oakland and is in dire need of repairs. New flooring, lighting, and signage are urgently needed.

The fit of our shoes is true-to-size and intentionally snug at first.

<li>A ruler or tape measure  </li>
<li>Masking tape or a pencil  </li>
<li>A door or flat section of wall with flat baseboards </li>
</ul><p><strong>How to measure your feet:</strong></p><ul>
<li>Barefoot, <strong>stand straight with your heel against the wall or door.</strong> Do this in the evening, or the afternoon at least, once you’ve been on your feet for a while. Who wants to measure feet in the morning anyway?</li>
<li>
<strong>Mark the end of your foot</strong> by placing a piece of masking tape or a pencil on the floor parallel to the wall, flush with the tip of your furthest toe.</li>
<li>Stand back up straight and<strong> check again.</strong> Is your marker right on? As your carpenter would say, measure twice and cut once. (Please do not make any cuts in this process.) Adjust the tape if necessary. </li>
<li>This is exhausting, and you deserve a break. <strong>Step away from the wall. </strong>Be careful not to disturb the tape/pencil marking the length of your foot.</li>
<li>
<strong>Measure the distance</strong> from the wall/door to the tape/pencil.</li>
<li>
<strong>Repeat with your other foot</strong>, since most folks have feet with slightly different lengths. This probably goes without saying, but if your feet are different sizes, you should buy for your larger foot.</li>
<li>
<strong>Look up your shoe size</strong> in the tables below. If you’re between sizes, round up to the next one</li>

Backers can choose from almost unlimited design options! Colors and patterns are subject to change over the course of the campaign (we'll keep you informed if we do!), but our current offering includes:
10 Canvas colors
13 silk-screened patterns, or choose no pattern at all!
12 ink colors available
12 kanga patterns for the lining
The Afridrille is available in standard US mens' and womens' sizes. The fit of our shoes is true-to-size and intentionally snug at first. Within a few hours, they’ll conform to your feet.Since we can not offer returns on customized Afridrilles, we encourage you to measure your feet at home to be 100% sure! Here’s what you’ll need:  
A ruler or tape measure  
Masking tape or a pencil  
A door or flat section of wall with flat baseboards 
How to measure your feet:
Barefoot, stand straight with your heel against the wall or door. Do this in the evening, or the afternoon at least, once you’ve been on your feet for a while. Who wants to measure feet in the morning anyway?

Mark the end of your foot by placing a piece of masking tape or a pencil on the floor parallel to the wall, flush with the tip of your furthest toe.
Stand back up straight and check again. Is your marker right on? As your carpenter would say, measure twice and cut once. (Please do not make any cuts in this process.) Adjust the tape if necessary. 
This is exhausting, and you deserve a break. Step away from the wall. Be careful not to disturb the tape/pencil marking the length of your foot.

Measure the distance from the wall/door to the tape/pencil.

Repeat with your other foot, since most folks have feet with slightly different lengths. This probably goes without saying, but if your feet are different sizes, you should buy for your larger foot.

Look up your shoe size in the tables below. If you’re between sizes, round up to the next one
After this Kickstarter campaign ends, we’ll send you an easy survey to fill out, and will also include a link to the Afridrille Designer if you ordered any ‘Custom’ pairs to design your shoes on the Zazzle platform! We plan to go into production by mid-May at the latest, and should deliver shoes to your door in time for the peak summer season.   Hurry up and back this campaign earlier rather than later, as shoes will be produced in the order that they are submitted!Classic Afridrille in Black Custom Afridrille with white checkerboard on black canvas Custom Afridrille with grey cactus on black canvas Custom Afridrille with white hearts on red canvas Custom Afridrille with white ikat on natural canvas Custom Afridrille with black herringbone on grey canvas Classic Afridrilles in white and safari      Impact begins with community!

However, our design and operations teams have encountered several risks in this project, and we're working hard to minimize them.The first set of risks are operational. With over 20,000 distinct designs, production requires strict processes to communicate production requirements, produce orders exactly as requested, and check quality at multiple points throughout the process.A second risk is controlling the build quality. Since these are made by hand and a first-of-its-kind product in Kenya, we can mitigate this risk by investing early in rigorous training programs for our Mums, defining consistent step-by-step processes, and ensuring we have multi-point quality control throughout the process to identify any issues early.Third, we are currently launching extensive real-world and laboratory wear-testing of our shoes to make sure that none of the materials have hidden defects that only reveal themselves in time. We will have the results from these tests before we need to start production of the Afridrille.",50.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Hi! My name is Kyle Berkman and I'm a web developer. I work for a handful of web design companies and also freelance. I'm experienced in HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL, &amp; SEO and have an overall great sense of design. I mainly enjoy working with the <a href=""http://www.wordpress.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">WordPress</a> platform as it allows the client to maintain their own site with little to no assistance. In terms of limitations, all of the websites above and in the gallery were built on <a href=""http://www.wordpress.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">WordPress</a>, so there really are none. The real game breaker is <em>if you can use Facebook then you can use <a href=""http://www.wordpress.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">WordPress</a></em>.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>The work outsourced to me is starting to slow down and I am forced to rely more heavily on freelancing than I have in the past. The problem is that most of the companies that I work for have forced me to sign NDA (non disclosure agreements) which forbid me from claiming hundreds of websites that I have designed or worked on in my freelance portfolio.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Solution</h3>
<div>Offer a website deal that is too good to pass up and build up a more complete portfolio in a short amount of time. Starting at $99, you get a fully customized website built on the <a href=""http://www.wordpress.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">WordPress</a> platform, all of your initial content added, and even a 1-hour tutoring session showing you how to update and maintain the site on your own, cutting the cost of owning a website down to just yearly hosting fee's (~$50 / year). </div>
<div><strong><br/></strong></div>
<div><strong>At this point, there is no reason not to have a website for your small business or personal use.</strong></div>
</div>
<div><strong><br/></strong></div>
<div>
<h3>What Can You Do To Help?</h3>
<p>If you or anyone you know is in need of a website, give me the chance to wow you and them by pledging for the website perk that applies to you. If you are unsure which one would apply or have any questions, please feel free to contact me at <a href=""mailto:berkman.kyle@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">berkman.kyle@gmail.com</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Once the fundraising has ended, I will contact you with all the information that you will need to provide and will be available to answer any other questions you may have. If you do not have all the information ready immediately, you don't need to worry. I will be ready to start at your convenience whether it be next week or next month.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Other Ways To Help?</h3>
<div>Aside from helping to spread the word, you can also assist me for much less by making a pledge for smaller designs like business cards, letterhead, or flyers.

More Details On Website Perks.

With all 4 perks, you get a custom design based on your input and suggestions. I can work with as much or as little as you are able to provide. From a visitors standpoint, none of the sites will visually look any better or worse, but just provide different levels of functionality and customization.      
The classic $99 website: $99 - This is the basic site. It's essentially a place for your visitors to find information and media. It can be quite comprehensive though and has the ability to expand incredibly in functionality, so don't let that fool you. The e-merchant website: $125 - Same as the above but allows you to sell your products directly to the visitor via an online checkout system. I will add your first 25 items and show you how to add your own in our 1-hour tutoring session. The custom artwork (or software) website: $150 - This is meant for the designer who has already graphically designed how they want their site to look in Photoshop or a similar program. You would generally provide a layered file that I would then chop up and re-construct into an actual site. Please contact me first regarding your artwork so I can verify it is usable.


*I've modified this perk to include the option of replacing the custom artwork with custom software. (ie: scheduling portal software, etc) Please check with me first so I can verify that the software is compatible with WordPress or that an alternative option is available.* Custom artwork (or software) e-merchant website: $175 - Same as the above, with the addition of the online checkout system. Again,  I will add your first 25 items and show you how to add your own in our 1-hour tutoring session.

<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><br/> The game is focused on creating a dynamic gaming experience by featuring an interactive world that is constantly changing; whether due to environmental factors, AI-Controlled empires or various other beings populating each unique, randomly generated world.</p>

<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><br/> To further explain the kind of mysteries or situations you may find yourself in whilst traversing one of the multitudes of large randomly-generated landscapes, I shall give a few examples.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Imagine two large Empires at War with eachother and you are tasked to infiltrate the other in order to wage havoc and bring it down from the inside. Perhaps you choose to do the polar opposite and actually aid this Empire in the destruction of the Empire that gave you the task.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Perhaps you come across a small town and you hear a rumour that the mayor is corrupt in his fianances with the local bandits. There are a ton of ways to aproach this.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Maybe you approach the mayor as a trade partner offering foreign goods and invite him to a meal on your behalf, maybe he'll accept maybe he won't depends on how you handle the situation.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">You could use this moment to get him drunk openely, discuss what he's up to, befriend him, knock him out or drug him.</p>

I do however have an in-depth knowledge into the different gameplay types and how they can affect and change different aspects of the game; this is due to the fact that I have essentially been playing games for years.

Warcraft 3 (+ The Frozen Throne), Dune 2, Populous, Zelda: ALTTP, Dwarf Fortress, Settlers.
 Conclusion
I would like to give a shoutout to all you amazing fans that have followed and supported us throughout a lot of the early development days of The Old World! To all you new and old fans, You're Awesome!

Ironstrom

Hi, I'm Mark ""Ironstrom/Ku-Ko"" Jackson of Virtual Static. I'm 21 majoring in Computer Science at University on my up-coming 3rd year and TOW is our project.
 
Team Responsibilities
I'm the member of the team that is renowned for glueing people together. I'm a promoter of team attitudes, casual communication and all-round morale booster.
I influence most aspects of game design planning, world presentation thoughts and environmental design aethetics as a former level designer for the past 10 years; this is my greatest skill/interest.
I also do most of the promotional work related to the game. Most of it involves talking to the fans about the game and re-communicating those thoughts back into the design process. I currently spend much of my time trying to get in contact with indie supporting websites and channels.
Personal Preference Games
My stand out games that I love that'd I'd like to share are Warcraft 3 (+ The Frozen Throne) Grim Fandango, Outcast, Sacrifice and Asheron's Call 2.
Conclusion
I'd like to say thanks to those that have stuck around with us and those new-comers that have come to find us wherever they may have come from, be it word of ear from one of us, your friends or a site and so fourth. Thanks for visiting and thanks for supporting us to continue not only a dream project of ours but of yours too.

Citizen

My name is Taylor ""Citizen"" Dickson of Virtual Static, and I’m a 20 year old music student studying at the University of Surrey in Guildford, United Kingdom.
 
Team Responsibilities
Currently the Musical Director and Producer of The Old World, as well as Sound Designer. I joined the project about halfway through the development to the current stage. I am responsible for providing direction for the musical style of The Old World, as well as filling the world with sound effects and creating an immersive, living sonic environment.

Past Experience

Over the number of years I have been writing music, I have composed for a score (pun intended) of different forms of entertainment – ranging from atmospheric minimalist music for documentaries, to heavily stylised electronica reworks of popular musical tunes for British Theatre. I previously wrote commercial music under the name ‘Red Hare Productions’, however this was pre-University and I have since undergone a complete style overhaul and moved away from that name. Currently I produce under the alias ‘Citizen’, and hoping to release an electronica Glitch-Hop EP before the end of 2012.
Personal Preference Games
Warcraft 3 - The Frozen Throne.
Conclusion
I'm excited to be working on The Old World with such a dedicated team of individuals. This will be the first game score I have done solo, and I am determined to make it one to remember.

TDesius

Hi there, I’m Ryan ""TDesius"" Chambers of Virtual Static. I’m 19 years old and I am currently studying Extended Level 3 IT at college and I’m currently on my 2nd year.
 
Team Responsibilities
I was recently introduced to the team of TOW by Mark/Ironstrom, even so I have contributed as much as I could so far towards TOW. In the future I plan to be helping the team of TOW with the development of TOW and any future games they may create, In order to successfully do this I am currently making sure that everything I learn at college is being practiced and written down. While I have no real experience with games development yet I am able to quickly adapt to new tasks and am a fast learner. I do however have an in-depth knowledge into the different gameplay types and how they can affect and change different aspects of the game; this is due to the fact that I have essentially been playing games for years. Sure everyone has played games for years; however I have always made sure to widen the genres of the games I decide to play.
Personal Preference Games:
Warcraft 3 (+The Frozen Throne), World of Warcraft
Conclusion:
Thanks to everyone who is reading this, helping to support our cause or overall just following us and getting your friends to join, because as they say “Every bit helps”.",16.0,0,"1 Campaign

</tbody></table></div>","We first want to say THANK YOU for stopping by and checking out our very first Indiegogo campaign! WE NEED YOUR HELP!  Just a little over two years old, we are an evolving clothing brand looking to make waves in fashion by promoting a SOLID MESSAGE and by GIVING BACK, but we need your help in getting BARNABAS to the next level.
       WHAT WE PLAN ON DOING WITH THE MONEY?

We know you want your Barnabas gear as soon as possible, so we are already working with our manufacturing on production. We need the money to get this first batch manufactured and shipped.
10% of raised campaign sales will go directly to The Living Room Intl. helping those impacted and infected with HIV/AIDS in Kenya.
  Invest in a sales team to help distribute our brand into retail outlets nationwide & internationally
 Allocate funds towards strategic events/tradeshows & marketing/publicity
 Invest in setting up the SPRING/SUMMER 2013 collections
 And of course,...more 'Mustache Wristbands'

Please join us in making a difference & look fashionable as you do it!

 
 
 


 




 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Be bold and courageous! Be fearless in making choices that make a difference. Barnabas Clothing Co. was created to challenge people to live their lives with purpose and action, to live A LIFE WORTH IMITATING. So, BARNABAS is more than a brand or a logo; it's an identity and lifestyle. The actual meaning of the name is ""Son of Encouragement,"" and here at BARNABAS we see our purpose as just that - to be people of encouragement in every aspect of our lives - with what we say, what we do and even with the clothes we wear.
 ONE life, ...just ONE life can make an impact! We hope that when you wear our clothes, you take on that challenge - to be a BARNABAS – that you will be bold and courageous and become part of this massive community that is sending ripples of change and hope out into the world.

 
 
 
 



 
 


 
 





 
 
 
 
 
 

We have partnered with our good friend Juli McGowan Boit, the founder of The Living Room International in Kipkaren, Kenya. The Living Room International is a non-profit organization that provides comprehensive care to those men, women and children living with HIV/AIDS or other life threatening illnesses. Their vision is to be a community that honors life and offers hope and they do so by becoming family to those that are dying. The organization has a 26 bed inpatient hospice facility that allows them to provide compassionate medical, emotional and spiritual support for the patient in their final days of life. The environment and atmosphere is that of a home - everyone is welcome, everyone is loved, and everyone belongs. No one is left to face their pain or fears alone.

 
 
 
 
 


 
 
 
 
 

 It really does! Some business/brands say they give back to a charity or an organization, but don't tangibly show you in what ways your purchase makes a difference. We look for ways to connect the dots for customers by featuring in each inside label what 10% of your purchase equates to at The Living Room International with our 'BECAUSE OF YOU' quotes.

 
 
 
 
 
 


 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 


 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 


A grandmother in Africa caring for her orphaned grandchildren will receive milk for a week.
A mother in Africa, living with AIDS will be able to reach a nearby HIV clinic to receive life-prolonging treatment.

     products that people want 


We’re selling everything we
     make


We need to make MORE so we can sell MORE and therefore do MORE GOOD


HOW CAN YOU HELP?
Three Ways 

BUY A PERK - It's no secret, we're seeking funding, funding to acquire the resources we need to take our brand to a national... no... global
     level 


SHARE THIS
     CAMPAIGN - Share with your friends, their friends, your family, someone else's family, co-workers, basically
     everyone you know

yet... 




The Outdoor Office 
Finally the solution you've been looking for! Carry your tablet, an old fashioned notebook, and other essentials for productivity on the go. 



Handcrafted Style & Function




The Outdoor Office is the perfect solution for someone who has embraced the latest technology yet still appreciates the flexibility and ease of a simple notebook. Just watch the short video below to just how functional this product can be. (*iPad not included)





BUT DON'T STOP THERE... 

CHECK OUT OUR OTHER PERKS BELOW...



The Feed / Hope Strap








"".... Be not simply good; Be good for something"" - Henry David Thoreau










We built this business around 2 non-profit organizations we wanted to support. 25% of our profit goes directly to these two organizations which provide FOOD for hungry families or HOPE for children in need of therapy.
Please see below for more about the organizations we support. 










The (Veg Tan) Smallet







The ultimate front pocket
wallet or combination business card holder. 






You'll be amazed at how something so small and simple can become so cherished and valued as it darkens with age and use. Veg Tan is a very popular leather that truly expresses the journey you carry it through. Whether you're looking for a simple everyday carry or a special spot for your business cards, you will not be disappointed. 






The
Horween Minimalist Wallet







Handcrafted Refinement With a Minimalist Touch & Accented Style





With this design we were determined to trim the wallet fat... Why do we all insist on carrying all that STUFF in our wallet?... Seriously, when was the last time you got to the checkout counter and showed them ""All Your Cards"". Nobody wants to see that, it's embarrassing. 
WE SAY... Let's save the Fat for our Bacon and eliminate the notion that butt cheek dents are cool. 
WE SAY... Let's turn back the clock to a time where a man would flaunt his moustache rather than his butt stash...  






The
Barnwood Belt








Simple in Design Yet Worthy To Stand the Test of Time 







When we decided to offer a belt we only wanted to offer 2 things... Leather and Steel... No bonding... No stitching... No fillers... just a belt you could wear for decades and use to rappel out of the occasional window, should the need arise. 
Just remember - Black belt, Black shoes... Brown Belt, Brown shoes... So buy both.  





The Mini Outdoor Office (NEW)The functionality of the original meets the mini version of the technology. 



Built to carry any tablet of equal or smaller size than the iPad Mini. Have you ever read a book on your Kindle and wanted to take notes or jot down thoughts? Now you have a place to do both. 


The Journey Strap

Life's a journey. Thanks for participating in ours. 

At Barnwood Leather we believe that purpose defines action and action develops character. When you own one of our products you not only know you did a lot of GOOD, but you also have a pretty awesome story to tell. - Journey On!

<b>Here's our Story.</b> </h3>
<p> 
</p>
<p>We
were born and raised in Kenya. After High School, we came to the USA to further
our studies. During our travels back and forth from USA to Kenya, we started
noticing some interesting facts. Poverty was still rampant all over Africa,
un-employment was an everyday problem, and to fix this, education has to be
emphasized. Something had to be done from a grassroots level, create awareness
and try and be a part of the solution to one or all of these issues. We started
visiting schools, workshops and factories just to see how things operated. It
is during a couple of these visits that we met Maasai artisans who made very artistic and stylish sandals using a
Maasai beading tradition, some leather and recycled car tires. This was a
brilliant idea; it included the African culture and eco-friendly footwear. If a
Maasai in Africa can come up with an idea to be eco-friendly, why can’t the
whole world be eco-friendly? All these hardworking artisans were lacking was
market access and a modern design input. </p>

My work involved me going out of town for 4 to 6 weeks at a time, so I didn't have a great deal of time to work on them. My oldest son was out of work so I had him make a mold of the first products so that I could just dip in paint and sew by lines. (I had no experience using a sewing machine.) I had friends and family try them, and with their input, I have finally got to the final product that I am proud to see on the store shelves. This was originally meant for those that had limited range of motion, arthritis, or even those in wheelchairs that had to rely on others to wash them. However, after having everyone try them, I noticed that my son-in-law (which is a mechanic) that came home with grease on his hands even after washing, he still had like a stain. Once he used the Exfoliator Body Scrubber, his hands were coming out very clean. That opened the market up to just about anyone that would like to get a whole body cleansing without relying on others. Once you use one it is hard to go back to the original products that you were using. They also replace many of the products that are cluttering up your shower. My goal is to see my products on the shelves at the stores. I am the only one making them at this time, so I couldn't possibly supply a chain of stores with a large order without having the means to do so. I would like to find a manufacturer that can work with me, making sure that the quality is number one at all times.<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p> <ul> <li>We are looking to raise a minimum of $25,000. This is to get set up in a manufacturing environment instead of my dining room. Either I find a manufacturer preferably local, to help me get these mass produced. The money would be used for materials, hiring help for the orders before a manufacturer and machines and employees if I have to do it myself. Like I said my goal is to get these on the shelves to stores that sell bathing products. </li> <li>For those that contribute $1.00 to $24.99, your name will be posted on our website's supporters page. </li>
<li>
<p>For $25.00 to $49.99 you will receive 1 body scrubber (your choice of style), color will depend on what is available. Plus, your name will be posted on the supporters page on our website. Once we reach the goal, we ask 4 to 6 weeks to deliver products. However, as we are getting the support I will be making them, so most likely some will receive them much sooner.</p>
<p>Estimated delivery: <time>Apr 2016</time></p>
<p>Ships anywhere in the world</p>
<br/>
</li>
<li>
<p></p>
<p>All pledges of $50 and above will receive 2 body scrubbers of your choice of style, color will depend on what is available. Plus, your name will be posted on the supporters page on our website. Once we reach the goal we ask 4 to 6 weeks to deliver products. However, as we are getting the support I will be making them, so most likely some will receive them much sooner.</p>
<p>Estimated delivery: <time>Apr 2016</time></p>
<p>Ships anywhere in the world</p>
<br/>
</li> <li>If we cannot reach the goal, I will still use the money to continue to get more of The Body Scrubbers out until they are well known and we can get them in stores. Just by word of mouth, we are already getting business, even before I was ready to get this all launched. </li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Feel free to explain more about your campaign and let people know how the difference their contribution will make:</p> <ul> <li>There are separate products out there that do only one thing such as exfoliate your face or within your reach. Those products have to be held tight or they will fall out of your hand. These Body Scrubbers are made to help those that cannot grip tightly for any amount of time, you just slip your hand in one mitt, soap up the back, grab the back with the mitt that you have on, put it behind you to where you can easily slip your other hand in the other mitt and the fun begins. It helped one of my family friends that is 93 years old. He had trouble walking because his circulation wasn't very good. He said that he sat in his shower and just scrubbed up and down with the body scrubber at least 3 times on his back and in a few days he noticed that he didn't need to be leaning on walls, tables, chairs or anything because he could feel his legs and feet much better.</li> <li>I also want to try to get the packaging better. Like I said, at the moment, I am the only one making these. I turned my dining room into a mini warehouse so right now I use my own printer and these are so light weight it is easy to wrap them in plastic wrap. </li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>Main risks and challenges are to keep up with the demand. Just by word of mouth, I am getting orders and people love them.

</li> </ul> </div> <p>And that's all there is to it.</p></div>","Short Summary I have been working on these since July of 2014. My work involved me going out of town for 4 to 6 weeks at a time, so I didn't have a great deal of time to work on them. My oldest son was out of work so I had him make a mold of the first products so that I could just dip in paint and sew by lines. (I had no experience using a sewing machine.) I had friends and family try them, and with their input, I have finally got to the final product that I am proud to see on the store shelves. This was originally meant for those that had limited range of motion, arthritis, or even those in wheelchairs that had to rely on others to wash them. However, after having everyone try them, I noticed that my son-in-law (which is a mechanic) that came home with grease on his hands even after washing, he still had like a stain. Once he used the Exfoliator Body Scrubber, his hands were coming out very clean. That opened the market up to just about anyone that would like to get a whole body cleansing without relying on others. Once you use one it is hard to go back to the original products that you were using. They also replace many of the products that are cluttering up your shower. My goal is to see my products on the shelves at the stores. I am the only one making them at this time, so I couldn't possibly supply a chain of stores with a large order without having the means to do so. I would like to find a manufacturer that can work with me, making sure that the quality is number one at all times.   What We Need & What You Get Break it down for folks in more detail:  We are looking to raise a minimum of $25,000. This is to get set up in a manufacturing environment instead of my dining room. Either I find a manufacturer preferably local, to help me get these mass produced. The money would be used for materials, hiring help for the orders before a manufacturer and machines and employees if I have to do it myself. Like I said my goal is to get these on the shelves to stores that sell bathing products.  For those that contribute $1.00 to $24.99, your name will be posted on our website's supporters page. 

For $25.00 to $49.99 you will receive 1 body scrubber (your choice of style), color will depend on what is available. Plus, your name will be posted on the supporters page on our website. Once we reach the goal, we ask 4 to 6 weeks to deliver products. However, as we are getting the support I will be making them, so most likely some will receive them much sooner.
Estimated delivery: Apr 2016
Ships anywhere in the world




All pledges of $50 and above will receive 2 body scrubbers of your choice of style, color will depend on what is available. Plus, your name will be posted on the supporters page on our website. Once we reach the goal we ask 4 to 6 weeks to deliver products. However, as we are getting the support I will be making them, so most likely some will receive them much sooner.
Estimated delivery: Apr 2016
Ships anywhere in the world

 If we cannot reach the goal, I will still use the money to continue to get more of The Body Scrubbers out until they are well known and we can get them in stores. Just by word of mouth, we are already getting business, even before I was ready to get this all launched.     The Impact Feel free to explain more about your campaign and let people know how the difference their contribution will make:  There are separate products out there that do only one thing such as exfoliate your face or within your reach. Those products have to be held tight or they will fall out of your hand. These Body Scrubbers are made to help those that cannot grip tightly for any amount of time, you just slip your hand in one mitt, soap up the back, grab the back with the mitt that you have on, put it behind you to where you can easily slip your other hand in the other mitt and the fun begins. It helped one of my family friends that is 93 years old. He had trouble walking because his circulation wasn't very good. He said that he sat in his shower and just scrubbed up and down with the body scrubber at least 3 times on his back and in a few days he noticed that he didn't need to be leaning on walls, tables, chairs or anything because he could feel his legs and feet much better. I also want to try to get the packaging better. Like I said, at the moment, I am the only one making these. I turned my dining room into a mini warehouse so right now I use my own printer and these are so light weight it is easy to wrap them in plastic wrap.     Risks & Challenges  Main risks and challenges are to keep up with the demand. Just by word of mouth, I am getting orders and people love them. I am willing to become a manufacturer if necessary, because many manufacturers do not want to work with the nylon netting in so many layers, but I have created a way to easily work with it and am able to make them very well and easily. I am not a professional seamstress, but I did get the patterns made professionally helping me make 3 sizes and all look the same. Materials have been a problem also, but I have found some that work with me, but I haven't bought large orders from them yet so the price is still a little higher at the moment.

<h3>A Swiss watch for new times.</h3>
<h3>Archetypical design without frills.</h3>
<h3>As confident as its owner.</h3>
<p>We call it «Bólido», Spanish for meteor. A luminary that crosses between the somewhat immovable fixed stars of established brands on the watch firmament. A timepiece with surprising qualities at a completely un-Swiss price.​</p>
<h1> </h1>
<div data-id=""17253919""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1500413942/coztu8y8mq7bojzwwqrn.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<h1>  </h1>
<h3>Bólido is 100% Swiss made</h3>
<p>The new Federal Ordinance, in force since 1 Jan 2017 makes it difficult to launch a reasonably priced ‘Swiss Made’ mechanical watch. While movement and assembly always had to be Swiss, parts such as the watch cases that require expensive forging tooling and multiple labour-intensive operations must now have at least 60% Swiss content. The capacities of suppliers that use the usual production methods are absorbed by the big luxury brands which are able to afford their high costs.</p>
<h1> </h1>
<h3>The Bólido​ Concept</h3>
<p>We therefore chose to manufacture the Bólido case employing automatic lathing machines; in contrast to traditional case production, this so-called ‘décolletage’ is highly competitive and there is ample capacity for it in Switzerland. Sophisticated lathing machines are even able to do the finishing and polishing simultaneously.</p>
<div data-id=""16935893""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1500413942/y7l5yu4p09ynsehaou4c.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<h2> </h2>
<h3>‘Intelligent design’          </h3>
<p>It did not bother us that this method leaves very little room for fancy design, however! On the contrary, Bólido was intended to be bold and out of step. Adding a second rotative axis not only tilts the face of the watch to facilitate time-reading in situations like car-driving, etc.; it also increases the case height at the top of the dial to allow the integration of a large winding crown in an unusual but well protected position.</p>
<div data-id=""16822025""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1500413943/abrgswrkrp1ihpxffyry.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<h1> </h1>
<p>Lathing also facilitates the implementation of yet another feature of the Bólido design:</p>
<h3>The Bólido monocoque case construction</h3>
<p>With it, the movement with its dial and hands is inserted into the case from the top. This unusual construction eliminates a third of the parts, including the case back and gasket – what is not there cannot leak and costs nothing! This kind of systematic exploration of production-specific properties has allowed us to build the Bólido entirely in Switzerland economically and with the same high quality that applies to famous luxury brands.</p>
<p> </p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/218058125?portrait=0""></iframe></div></div>
<h2> </h2>
<h3>The heart of the Bólido: the self-winding mechanical movement</h3>
<p>The movement is supplied to us by a leading manufacturer and is hand-assembled by highly skilled craftsmen and women. The cost of such a movement relates to two main factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accuracy of adjustment in several position-angles</li>
<li>The finishing of the parts: enhancing the precision by reducing tolerances to broaden the range of adjustability; the beauty of such finishing is a welcome side effect.</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not cut corners in either of these two areas. On the contrary: the Bólido movements are built to our exacting specifications of regulation in 5 positions (instead of the usual 3), and the meticulous finishing is underscored by Geneva stripes and engine-turned decoration.</p>
<div data-id=""17087301""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1500413944/cayxez1itilejryvswqu.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<h3> <br/>The dial face         </h3>
<p>The dial and hands match Bólido’s functionality; we spent a significant amount of time searching for the best readability from different angles, distances and in varying light conditions. We finally chose the simplicity of a generic instrument scale, because reinventing the wheel will not make it better; SuperLuminova plots on the dial and hands enable excellent reading in darkness.</p>
<div data-id=""17097819""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1500413944/w6rksv1uxzj7rhowpi8n.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<h1>      </h1>
<h3>Band and folding buckle</h3>
<p>The band is hand cast in natural latex-based rubber; it is highly resistant to saltwater, hence its popularity amongst professional divers. It only requires a rinse with soap once in a while to keep it looking like new, even after many years. A quality watch is recognisable by its buckle, but even luxury brands often charge extra for an elaborate folding buckle with a safety clasp as is used for Bólido.​</p>

<p>In spite of its fashionable size, Bólido watches fit to almost every wrist-size, even very small ones. This is because the distance between the axes of the two springbars holding the band-ends underneath the case is only 32 mm. Regular gents watches of comparable size have a typical axis-distance of 42 mm or more.</p>

<h3>Service     </h3>
<p>What watch start-ups and watch buyers often forget is that a mechanical timepiece is as good as its after-sale care; any elaborate warranty is worthless if it is not backed by solid, bricks and mortar service facilities that stock all the necessary parts. Our business plan includes sufficient spare parts to last at least 10 years right from the start of production. A two year warranty covers all manufacturing faults and material defects. And you'll find Bólido Service Centres with highly skilled watch makers to provide maintenance and repairs in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Switzerland: Bólido Uhrenservice, Glarnerstr. 25, 8854 Siebnen</li>
<li>Germany (for the EU): Ventura Watches, Gattingerstr. 11, 97076 Wuerzburg</li>
<li>USA: Swisservice Inc., 1774 East Herbert Avenue, Salt Lake City, UT 84108</li>
<li>Japan: Preciluxe Co. Ltd., 〒227-0067 神奈川県横浜市青葉区松風台14-41</li>
</ul>
<p>And one more thing: when our regular e-shop opens after this campaign it will efficiently facilitate and transact all your servicing needs online.</p>
<h3> <br/>Standard retail prices</h3>

<h1> </h1>
</div></div>","After our crowdfunding project has ended very successfully, we were invited by Indiegogo InDemand for an encore. Bólido timepieces can be ordered at www.bolido.rocks

 
 
 

          
 
 
 
A Swiss watch for new times.
Archetypical design without frills.
As confident as its owner.
We call it «Bólido», Spanish for meteor. A luminary that crosses between the somewhat immovable fixed stars of established brands on the watch firmament. A timepiece with surprising qualities at a completely un-Swiss price.​
 

  
Bólido is 100% Swiss made
The new Federal Ordinance, in force since 1 Jan 2017 makes it difficult to launch a reasonably priced ‘Swiss Made’ mechanical watch. While movement and assembly always had to be Swiss, parts such as the watch cases that require expensive forging tooling and multiple labour-intensive operations must now have at least 60% Swiss content. The capacities of suppliers that use the usual production methods are absorbed by the big luxury brands which are able to afford their high costs.
 
The Bólido​ Concept
We therefore chose to manufacture the Bólido case employing automatic lathing machines; in contrast to traditional case production, this so-called ‘décolletage’ is highly competitive and there is ample capacity for it in Switzerland. Sophisticated lathing machines are even able to do the finishing and polishing simultaneously.

 
‘Intelligent design’          
It did not bother us that this method leaves very little room for fancy design, however! On the contrary, Bólido was intended to be bold and out of step. Adding a second rotative axis not only tilts the face of the watch to facilitate time-reading in situations like car-driving, etc.; it also increases the case height at the top of the dial to allow the integration of a large winding crown in an unusual but well protected position.

 
Lathing also facilitates the implementation of yet another feature of the Bólido design:
The Bólido monocoque case construction
With it, the movement with its dial and hands is inserted into the case from the top. This unusual construction eliminates a third of the parts, including the case back and gasket – what is not there cannot leak and costs nothing! This kind of systematic exploration of production-specific properties has allowed us to build the Bólido entirely in Switzerland economically and with the same high quality that applies to famous luxury brands.
 

 
The heart of the Bólido: the self-winding mechanical movement
The movement is supplied to us by a leading manufacturer and is hand-assembled by highly skilled craftsmen and women. The cost of such a movement relates to two main factors:

Accuracy of adjustment in several position-angles
The finishing of the parts: enhancing the precision by reducing tolerances to broaden the range of adjustability; the beauty of such finishing is a welcome side effect.

We do not cut corners in either of these two areas. On the contrary: the Bólido movements are built to our exacting specifications of regulation in 5 positions (instead of the usual 3), and the meticulous finishing is underscored by Geneva stripes and engine-turned decoration.

 The dial face         
The dial and hands match Bólido’s functionality; we spent a significant amount of time searching for the best readability from different angles, distances and in varying light conditions. We finally chose the simplicity of a generic instrument scale, because reinventing the wheel will not make it better; SuperLuminova plots on the dial and hands enable excellent reading in darkness.

      
Band and folding buckle
The band is hand cast in natural latex-based rubber; it is highly resistant to saltwater, hence its popularity amongst professional divers. It only requires a rinse with soap once in a while to keep it looking like new, even after many years. A quality watch is recognisable by its buckle, but even luxury brands often charge extra for an elaborate folding buckle with a safety clasp as is used for Bólido.​

 
Box

 
Bólido quality​​​​​​​​

Surgical grade stainless steel case
Scratch-resistant sapphire crystal
Water resistant to 100m / 330ft, every watch tested prior to shipment
Exclusive natural rubber strap
Adjustable stainless steel folding buckle
Swiss Mechanical Automatic Movement regulated in 5 positions
44 hours power reserve


In spite of its fashionable size, Bólido watches fit to almost every wrist-size, even very small ones. This is because the distance between the axes of the two springbars holding the band-ends underneath the case is only 32 mm. Regular gents watches of comparable size have a typical axis-distance of 42 mm or more.

 
Experience
Simon Husslein has designed watches for Ventura, Braun and NOMOS Glashütte and received numerous awards internationally.
Pierre Nobs is a veteran entrepreneur and was the founder of the Ventura Watch Company.
Our combined experience enables us to communicate what we actually want to our suppliers and how it has to be done, rather than just buying what is offered; in fact, every single part of the Bólido timepiece is custom-made to match our exigence for quality and design.

    
Work in progress



     
Service     
What watch start-ups and watch buyers often forget is that a mechanical timepiece is as good as its after-sale care; any elaborate warranty is worthless if it is not backed by solid, bricks and mortar service facilities that stock all the necessary parts. Our business plan includes sufficient spare parts to last at least 10 years right from the start of production. A two year warranty covers all manufacturing faults and material defects. And you'll find Bólido Service Centres with highly skilled watch makers to provide maintenance and repairs in:

Switzerland: Bólido Uhrenservice, Glarnerstr. 25, 8854 Siebnen
Germany (for the EU): Ventura Watches, Gattingerstr. 11, 97076 Wuerzburg
USA: Swisservice Inc., 1774 East Herbert Avenue, Salt Lake City, UT 84108
Japan: Preciluxe Co. Ltd., 〒227-0067 神奈川県横浜市青葉区松風台14-41

And one more thing: when our regular e-shop opens after this campaign it will efficiently facilitate and transact all your servicing needs online.

BÓLIDO WHITE | BÓLIDO BLACK: € | CHF | US$ 650.-

<p><strong>Think back…</strong></p>
<p>How often have you tried on a piece of outfit and realize that it <strong>does not fit you perfectly</strong>? <strong>Too long? Too loose on the sides? Arm holes are too huge? </strong></p>
<p>How often you realized that you are a UK8 for tops, but a UK10 for bottoms?</p>
<p>How often are clothes purchased by you, online, <strong>neglected or given away</strong>?</p>
<p>Have you ever feel mood and confidence dampen because your clothes are not perfectly fitting, styles are not the best for you as well?</p>
<p>That’s because current UK and US size guides are too standardized and outdated. No one is a perfect UK 8 or US 10. Body sizes and shapes differ in each individual, especially for us, Asians.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Kirsten, although most people know my business name of Fabric Dragon.  I had an awful time in school, largely due to an undiagnosed learning disability, and put off college because I just couldn't imagine going through that anymore.</p>
<p>I spent the time learning my business the hard way. I started in costuming and fabric sales before finally developing a steady business selling custom made jewelry.  I love making things that are unique, so that even if I try I cannot make exactly the same thing twice! (I also sell beads and supplies for the people who prefer to make their own.)</p>
<p>At 44 I finally decided that I was ready to try this whole ""school"" thing again, and enrolled in The Art Institute of Philadelphia, pursing a B.S. in Fashion Design. It was tough after being out of school for so long, but I only wish I had done it sooner!</p>
<p>In school we have projects that get increasingly complex as we get closer to graduating. We produce a line of clothing a lot like you see on those fashion shows, starting with just a few items, and leading up to our senior collections which have several complete outfits.</p>
<p>As you might expect from my background, I like unique fabrics and embellishments.  <strong>Which is where this campaign comes in...</strong></p>
<p>This quarter I had a project in school where I was needle felting designs into a coat. (Needle felting means meshing the fibers together with several sharp barbed needles.) It turned out to be a huge task that will take way more time than I thought, so I looked into a needle felting machine...</p>
<p>and fell in love.</p>
<p>Things I would never be able to do by hand were easy with that machine.  As it happens I know vendors who sell scraps of kimono fabrics, saris, and other beautiful fibers. This machine would let me mesh those fabrics and fibers together to create one-of-a-kind fabrics I can make into irreproducable clothes and accessories.</p>
<p><strong>NO ONE would ever be able to have exactly the same purse, or jacket, or whatever because the actual fabrics would be made JUST for that item.</strong></p>
<p>Not only  would this be fabulous for the coat I was embellishing, it would be something spectacular for my senior collection.  No one could have anything like it, because not only did I design that jacket, I made the fabric! Wow!</p>
<p>As it happens I know a number of people in the fashion industry (I know, a shock, right?). There is a market for up-cycled material, especially in one-of-a-kind wear like corsets and purses and pins.  Several of my friends in the industry have expressed interest in having me create the fabrics for a few items in their line.</p>
<p>In addition, being able to work with any sized scraps of fabric means that I could make pins, clutches or book covers out of scraps from your wedding dress, or other special occassion outfit, even if the pieces left over were really odd shapes or sizes!  This has gotten some interest from a friend who does wedding planning, and from another friend who makes bridal and prom  wear for a living.</p>
<p>So not only will this project be used for a school project (and possibly for sale in a boutique after it's graded), but it could very well lead to new business immediately!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>There are only a few things I really need for this:</p>
<p>First and foremost i will need a needle felting machine.  After a lot of research I have decided on a Babylock Embellisher.  YES there are other machines that are less expensive, but the Babylock has some of the best reviews for heavy use, and lets you customize the number of needles for different projects (and replace them individually if they break).  My local dealership is also full of great people who offer a LOT of support.</p>
<p>I will also need to buy some fabrics and fibers for this project. In specific, to get the kind of up-cycle-able kimono I want, I have to buy them in ten-pound lots. This will give me a good variety of kimono colors and patterns. I will need some recycled sari fibers and some backing fabrics. I will also need some other yarns and fibers, but these can often be purchased in smaller quantity. (I have beads, trust me there.)</p>
<p>So what *I* get is the tools and materials to make this project go...</p>
<p>and what do YOU get?</p>
<h3>PERKS!</h3>
<p>What better perks can you get than the products I want to make? Absolutely one of a kind, no one else can ever have one just like it pins, purses, even jackets! Imagine having  a messanger bag, pin, or clutch  that can never, ever, be exactly the same as someone else's! Something that makes people stop and ask where you got it. Something that didn't come from a mass market retailer. Something where you actually helped to CREATE the material itself!</p>
<p>Since I know what itss like to want to help out but be on a limited budget, I even have a perk for $5. For five dollars you can be immortalized in fashion! I will embelish a name (yours or another's) or a simple design (as long as it isn't trademarked) into one of my collection pieces!  You get a photo emailed to you of YOUR contribution to fashion!</p>
<p>I set my goal to allow me to get the machine, some of the fibers and fabrics, and mail your perks.  If I exceed my goal, I will be able to take off time from jewelry making to complete and deliver your perks sooner!</p>
</div>
<div>
<strong>If i do not make my goal I do not get to keep any of the money</strong>, as without the machine I cannot create the perks!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>(Since I will be trying to get this machine in any case, feel free to contact me through Facebook or Etsy about getting one of these perks made in the future.)</div>
<h3>Why This Matters</h3>
<div>
<p>Has there ever been something you always wished you could do? My graduating college with actual good grades is that to me.</p>
<p>In addition, as I said, I love making unique things, and this is about as unique as I can get!</p>
<p>You will be supporting an individual craftswoman, not a big business, who is making things by hand because she loves to, and who is supporting herself and her family through art, instead of spending the same money on ""everyone has one"" items made who knows where by no one knows who. Get something unique for your money!</p>
<p>I have a long track record of making things that people are happy with.  I have always stood by my products, and most of my business is from repeat customers.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
</div>
<p>I went back to college, so I understand that not everyone has the same kind of money. Right now what money I have goes to books and pet food.  EVERYONE can help though.</p>
<p>Publicity is worth way more than people think.</p>
<p>If you can tell people about this project, you will make a difference!</p>
<p>Share this on Facebook, Tweet it, tell your family to ""buy you a pin"", or just tell your friends who you know like interesting stuff. It all helps!</p>
<p>And the more often people talk about this project the more likely someone is to decide they would really like that messanger bag...</p></div>","Short Summary

In addition, being able to work with any sized scraps of fabric means that I could make pins, clutches or book covers out of scraps from your wedding dress, or other special occassion outfit, even if the pieces left over were really odd shapes or sizes!  This has gotten some interest from a friend who does wedding planning, and from another friend who makes bridal and prom  wear for a living.
So not only will this project be used for a school project (and possibly for sale in a boutique after it's graded), but it could very well lead to new business immediately!


What We Need & What You Get
There are only a few things I really need for this:
First and foremost i will need a needle felting machine.  After a lot of research I have decided on a Babylock Embellisher.  YES there are other machines that are less expensive, but the Babylock has some of the best reviews for heavy use, and lets you customize the number of needles for different projects (and replace them individually if they break).  My local dealership is also full of great people who offer a LOT of support.
I will also need to buy some fabrics and fibers for this project. In specific, to get the kind of up-cycle-able kimono I want, I have to buy them in ten-pound lots. This will give me a good variety of kimono colors and patterns. I will need some recycled sari fibers and some backing fabrics. I will also need some other yarns and fibers, but these can often be purchased in smaller quantity. (I have beads, trust me there.)
So what *I* get is the tools and materials to make this project go...
and what do YOU get?
PERKS!
What better perks can you get than the products I want to make? Absolutely one of a kind, no one else can ever have one just like it pins, purses, even jackets! Imagine having  a messanger bag, pin, or clutch  that can never, ever, be exactly the same as someone else's! Something that makes people stop and ask where you got it. Something that didn't come from a mass market retailer. Something where you actually helped to CREATE the material itself!
Since I know what itss like to want to help out but be on a limited budget, I even have a perk for $5. For five dollars you can be immortalized in fashion! I will embelish a name (yours or another's) or a simple design (as long as it isn't trademarked) into one of my collection pieces!  You get a photo emailed to you of YOUR contribution to fashion!
I set my goal to allow me to get the machine, some of the fibers and fabrics, and mail your perks.  If I exceed my goal, I will be able to take off time from jewelry making to complete and deliver your perks sooner!


If i do not make my goal I do not get to keep any of the money, as without the machine I cannot create the perks!
 
(Since I will be trying to get this machine in any case, feel free to contact me through Facebook or Etsy about getting one of these perks made in the future.)
Why This Matters

Has there ever been something you always wished you could do? My graduating college with actual good grades is that to me.
In addition, as I said, I love making unique things, and this is about as unique as I can get!
You will be supporting an individual craftswoman, not a big business, who is making things by hand because she loves to, and who is supporting herself and her family through art, instead of spending the same money on ""everyone has one"" items made who knows where by no one knows who. Get something unique for your money!
I have a long track record of making things that people are happy with.  I have always stood by my products, and most of my business is from repeat customers.


Other Ways You Can Help

I went back to college, so I understand that not everyone has the same kind of money. Right now what money I have goes to books and pet food.  EVERYONE can help though.
Publicity is worth way more than people think.
If you can tell people about this project, you will make a difference!
Share this on Facebook, Tweet it, tell your family to ""buy you a pin"", or just tell your friends who you know like interesting stuff. It all helps!
And the more often people talk about this project the more likely someone is to decide they would really like that messanger bag...",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>When you find your favorite pair of sunglasses, the ones that fit juuust right...The ones you never want to replace! Avenue Lou was born because replacing or losing your favorite pair of sunglasses is the worst! </p>
<p>We wanted to create a sunglass case that was durable, well designed and well made using materials that would keep your favorite pair of sunglasses safe and sound....Forever. So we came up with the greatest Sunglass Case ever known to mankind!</p>
<p> <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1314.photobucket.com/albums/t580/alandsar/LWP_AvenueLou_255_zps3d974b2e.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h1><strong>Premium Materials</strong></h1>
<p>When we set out to make our Lou's we wanted the best materials protecting your favorite sun sun's, so we went to work!</p>
<p>We found that a strong iron case would offer the best protection for that precious pair. </p>
<p>We wanted the material covering the case to be durable and long lasting so we found a leather calf skin that was perfect. The inside boasts a smooth suede-like material that will keep your shades lasting into the end of time and beyond.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1314.photobucket.com/albums/t580/alandsar/LWP_AvenueLou_131_zpsd012dc9d.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h1>Our Plan</h1>
<p>The funds raised through our Indiegogo project will be used to make our Avenue Lou Sunglass Case line, which includes 6 different designs. The funds will help with the costs associated with a large scale production run.</p>

</div></div>","Our Story
When you find your favorite pair of sunglasses, the ones that fit juuust right...The ones you never want to replace! Avenue Lou was born because replacing or losing your favorite pair of sunglasses is the worst! 
We wanted to create a sunglass case that was durable, well designed and well made using materials that would keep your favorite pair of sunglasses safe and sound....Forever. So we came up with the greatest Sunglass Case ever known to mankind!
 

Premium Materials
When we set out to make our Lou's we wanted the best materials protecting your favorite sun sun's, so we went to work!
We found that a strong iron case would offer the best protection for that precious pair. 
We wanted the material covering the case to be durable and long lasting so we found a leather calf skin that was perfect. The inside boasts a smooth suede-like material that will keep your shades lasting into the end of time and beyond.


Our Plan
The funds raised through our Indiegogo project will be used to make our Avenue Lou Sunglass Case line, which includes 6 different designs. The funds will help with the costs associated with a large scale production run.
Limited Edition - Each of our collections will be limited editions. Once we run through the collection a new one will be introduced. We would like to have a total of 12 designs in each collection. This is where we need your help!
Stretch Goal - If we reach $15,000 we will be able to make 6 other designs to add to our collection. This process will be crowd sourced. In other words, we will have a group of possible designs and YOU will get to decide what we produce to make the collection complete, plus some nice incentives for your help! (Don’t worry GUYS, we know you have favorite shades too, we will work on getting some designs for men as well.)

</div></div>","Blind
and visually impaired represent 314 mln group of people
around the world. They have limited perception of the world, which often does
not allow them to conduct a regular life.
Existing
Smart Glasses are expensive, cumbersome to use, but most of all are not
adapted to blind’s need.
Parsee is addressed to people with vision disability who have access to mobile network and possess a smartphone. With our solution they will explore the world as sighted people perceive it. Parsee provide full mobility, can be used freely anywhere and anytime. 
   







From
the moment we have started developing Parsee, our vision was to make a solution
which helps millions to live normally. Blind and visually impaired people with
Parsee glasses can read any printed text. Our revolutionary eyewear recognize shapes, colors, faces of loved ones and friends.


    





An
IP camera connected to simple 3D printed frame comunicates with a mobile device where our mobile app identifies text, colour, shape or face which
will output in sound to earphones attached to frame.



Conectivity – mobile app creates a hot spot,
which Parsee uses to send a photo stream from glasses and sound from
smartphone.


Rechargable
battery – in frame we put long life battery, which you can charge through micro USB.




                                 
                    Text Recognition                                                            Face Recognition
                                          
             Shapes & Items Recognition                                            Color Recognition













Patent pending


Working prototype


Preparations for further R&D – fundraising, consultations with
engineers.











Even
though we have big ambitions, we are a non – profit organization, with limited
resources and capacity. The largest possible number of people using Parsee solution – for free! This is our vision.
For
the last year we have been working on prototype, basing on our savings, time and
efforts in developing Parsee. Now we are close to important milestone:
improvement of our prototype and getting ready to support this ones, who need it
the most.

This is were you come in. With help from you, we plan to make Parsee
technologically ready to start production. 



Our team is based on experienced,
motivated and highly involved people. Participation in this project is a
challange and huge adventure.

Otherwise, if you're interested in getting two or three different watches as perks, you will need to pledge for them separately. Select the first perk in the perks section and go through to making the payment. Then come back to our campaign page and select the next perk and go through with that payment! Please use the same e-mail address for all pledges so we can easily match them.
How do I get an extra strap?Great idea to get an extra strap! After you select your watch and go through with the payment, we'll send you an email with a link to get an additional strap at a $20 discount. Steel straps are $65 (from $85) and leather straps are $45 (from $65). You can expect the email within 24 hours. Where do you ship?We ship to 40 countries: 

North America: United States, Canada, Mexico

Europe: United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Belgium, The Netherlands, Luxembourg, Italy, Vatican City, Spain, Portugal, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Austria, Monaco, San Marino, Greece, Croatia

Oceania: Australia, New Zealand

Asia: Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Macau, Taiwan, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia

Middle East: Israel, United Arab Emirates

What's the cost of shipping? How about taxes and duties?
Shipping is free to the 40 countries listed above.
If you live in the United States, Singapore, Hong Kong, the European Union, Norway or Switzerland, you're in luck -- we'll take care of the taxes and duties as well. You only pay the cost of the perk.
If you live in the other countries, shipping is free, but you will be responsible for the tax and duty payments. We'll give you an option to pre-pay the tax and duties before we ship. 
Can I interchange straps between the watches in this collection?The only band that is truly interchangeable between watches in the steel band for the Chrono-Diver and the GMT Watch. The leather bands for these watches have different buckles to match the style of the case.What's the warranty on the watches?All watches are covered by a two-year international warranty. We guarantee your watch (including the watch strap) to be free of any manufacturing defect for two years from the date of purchase. The warranty does not cover general wear, damage caused by accident, misuse, neglect or failed repair attempts.More questions? Email hello@linjer.co",46.0,0,"6 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Welcome to Club Midnite, the funnest brand on earth! We are a small company hailing from the epicenter of action sports...San Diego, California. We independently own and operate CM with just 2 partners and we've made quite a scene in the last 4 years that we have been in business. Until now, we have had 0 funding or investors, which has allowed us to be as crazy and as free as we want with our art! In the last 2 years we have done everything humanly  possible to stay independent, however we have reached our limit! If we are not able to raise the funds we need here with this Crowdfunding Campaign, we will be forced to close our doors.</p>
<p>We hope to raise enough money to continue making our art independently and be able to connect with people thru the genuine authenticity of our movement. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We decided to make a dream collection of limited edition products and experiences for our loyal customers and Club Members.</p>
<p>We aint a big fancy company with tons of departments and unnecessary bullshit. We created a business model that works and gets our raw, quality art, directly to people in a quick and efficient manner.  Our brand and movement are a vibe that creates products. Thats why we are asking for $20k in funding. We know the homies love our brand but we need to reach a bigger audience in order to keep going forward. Therefore 40% of the funding will be used for marketing while another 40% will be used for new product development. Expanding to different materials and categories...it's Wonka factory over here. We make what we love and we wear what we make. The last 20% will be used for Legal expansion to support the growth of the other 80% (taxes, trademarks, lawsuits from giants, you name it). We ain't gonna catch a case!</p>
<p>   That being said we have created a limited edition collection and label package just for this campaign and opportunity. This specific logo, embroidered in gold, will never be found produced on anything else. These color ways and these products will never be sold anywhere else. We've created our dream collection with no boundaries to make what we feel would really hit the sweet spot based on what yall need and want. </p>
<p>Marketing and product are our golden ticket....bottom line, thats it. The shit sells its self.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We set out to build a brand that gave people a memorable and unique experience from top to bottom since day one and that's exactly what we have done. We didn't have any money but we had a vision, drive and accessibility. Most importantly, we're not willing to compromise that for any price. To us, we are artists and this is our movement.  We want to be able to make our art with no restraints or input from anyone above, and it's been pretty damn effective so far! We've been rocking for 4 years and kicking ass all the way here. Now we invite you to be a part of the Club. Together we can take Club Midnite to the next level! Come have some fun, live a little, who knows where it goes from here. The Sky is the limit!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We're going to be 100% transparent. These last 4 years have been an entire risk and challenge every damn day! No start up money, no investors, no employees, no easy breaks, and definitely no quick buyout. But also all fun, all hard work,  and all opportunities every damn day while producing results! We took the hard way but we did it for a reason. WE OWN THIS. THIS IS OURS 100%. Two dudes from San Diego who truly cared about our culture staying alive and willing to do anything to keep it RAW. That being said we would love to push on and continue to face the risks and challenges daily. Whether it be production, legal, sourcing, sales, marketing, janitorial, IT, or whatever type of bullshit may come our way. We've got it handled with fuckin smiles on our faces because we are keeping the culture alive.</p>

<p><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Every piece of our jewelry is carefully hand crafted through a long process involving many stages: from defining the color palette, as starting point, to designing shapes, and adding textures; and finally to painting the details as a final touch. This is where the magic happens. Usually without any idea of the final product the artist let’s her imaginations and small pieces of clay guide her way to the final design. That is how every piece becomes truly unique.<br/></p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Impact and transparency</h2>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">At ch8se we measure success solely by the impact we make. The most intuitive way to express this is not through percentages and net sums, but by measuring real-world impact. For this we worked out our metric system, through which the impact of each product is exactly quantified. These are down to earth numbers, backed by our partner organisations.<br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.ch8se.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/impactgif.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div>
<div>Every product has a unique serial number<b> </b>that serves as an impact code. You can register that serial number on our website. When you do this, the code is redeemed, the donation will be transferred within a month to the right organization and the impact is added to the counter on your personal account. The code redeemer will be accessible right after the Indiegogo campaign.<br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455090559/gf0vavkhcyw6fd5htu4m.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>We take the matter of transparency very seriously. Everyone has a full insight to our monthly impact reports, which contain all the codes redeemed during the respective period, an optional message or username from the redeemer and the impact of each code. The reports will be public and accessible all the time. </p>

<h1 style=""text-align: center;"">Food for the children</h1>
<div><br/></div>

</div></div>","For every 10 shares we will plant a tree



1.6 billion people across the globe depend on forest products for their livelihoods
Up to 28,000 species are expected to become extinct by 2025 due to deforestation
Approximately 3.1 million children die from hunger each year
6.4 million children under age five died in 2015, nearly 17,000 every day





Can we make a change?






ch8se is the first apparel brand to donate away its entire advertising budget. This way a single hoodie can plant as many as 93 trees, a t-shirt can provide 46 months of clean water, or feed a child for 20 days. 





The
beauty of the concept is that by repurposing the advertising budget for donations, you can make a change without any additional costs, but by making a conscious consumer choice and utilising your
social reach. Today, with all the social media, it’s very simple, you help spread the word about us, and we don’t need to spend on ads. 



Sustainability, craftsmanshipand social inclusion



We are crazy about craftsmanship. All of our products are handmade in Europe out of non-GMO cotton with the highest attention to detail, carefully packaged using recycled materials. Multiple stages of the production and the packaging are being done through socially inclusive programs such as employing disabled young people, who would otherwise have a hard time earning an income.







The mission of ch8se is to have a positive impact not just by donating, but through all of its activities. We are doing our best to be the change we want to see.



Every product comes with a unique impact code, which you can redeem on our website, where you can keep track of all your future impact and share the impact you made. You will also receive a limited edition, hand made, silver plated #ch8ser lapel pin.





Choose your impact


To pre-order a product, just select the appropiate perk. 

We will contact you by the end of the campaign regarding the sizing and the design of your choice. For bigger pictures, details and size chart click the buttons bellow:


























 







Jewellery

Every piece of our jewelry is carefully hand crafted through a long process involving many stages: from defining the color palette, as starting point, to designing shapes, and adding textures; and finally to painting the details as a final touch. This is where the magic happens. Usually without any idea of the final product the artist let’s her imaginations and small pieces of clay guide her way to the final design. That is how every piece becomes truly unique.






Impact and transparency


At ch8se we measure success solely by the impact we make. The most intuitive way to express this is not through percentages and net sums, but by measuring real-world impact. For this we worked out our metric system, through which the impact of each product is exactly quantified. These are down to earth numbers, backed by our partner organisations.


Every product has a unique serial number that serves as an impact code. You can register that serial number on our website. When you do this, the code is redeemed, the donation will be transferred within a month to the right organization and the impact is added to the counter on your personal account. The code redeemer will be accessible right after the Indiegogo campaign.







We take the matter of transparency very seriously. Everyone has a full insight to our monthly impact reports, which contain all the codes redeemed during the respective period, an optional message or username from the redeemer and the impact of each code. The reports will be public and accessible all the time. 


Tree planting



By partnering with the Eden Reforestation Projects our products can restore native forests to the deforested regions of Madagascar, Ethiopia, Haiti and Nepal. 



As local villagers are hired to plant the trees, through these projects, they can provide a living to their families. And as the native forests get restored, the wildlife starts blooming again.


Food for the children

We feed hungry children in third world countries by donating to the World Food Program's school meal projects. A meal at school acts as a magnet to get children into the classroom. In poor countries, school meals are often the only regular and nutritious meal a child receives. They are an investment in the child’s future.


 It allows children to focus on their studies rather than their stomachs and helps to increase school enrollment and attendance, decrease drop-out rates, and improve cognitive abilities. As often as possible, food is bought locally, which benefits local farmers and the whole community while enhancing the sustainability of the programme.


Clean drinking water






We partnered up with One Day’s Wages in order to contribute to solving the global water crisis. Together, we can help people get access to improved water and sanitation through improvements such as wells, filtration systems, latrines and sanitation education.

MISSION

Pegasus Watches Venezia aims to offer a unique and high-quality watch allowing every person to wear a luxury and handcrafted timepiece that recalls the most famous 20th-century watches. Luxury is no longer for few. We are highly focused on our local context. As a matter of fact, straps are made ​​of genuine Italian leather and boxes are made of walnut from the city of Sorrento following traditional production techniques. We meet the demand of a consumer who is looking for a reliable, fashionable, luxury and at the same time, affordable timepiece.In order to offer you the perfect wearing experience, suitable for all wrist sizes, we only use 100% Italian leather treated with natural materials.






 All the types of leather used are from Veneto and Tuscany, two well known Italian tannery districts. Therefore, thanks to the expertise of our local and skilled artisans we provide soft, vintage and durable straps.

Each strap is handcrafted by skilled Italian artisans. We aim to produce unique and unrepeatable timepieces.



We cooperate with some of the most experienced watch manufacturers, who have produced luxury watches for notorious brands. Pegasus Venezia Legionarius is made of 316L stainless steel, offering high resistance and reliability. All watches going out of our factory will be subjected to a vigorous Quality Control. We want you to be 100% satisfied with your watch.

MOVEMENT

We use some of the best input materials on the market for this watch. The Legionarius model is powered by the 2115 Miyota, a reliable and robust quarz movement. Miyota has been building reputable, reliable movements for brands like Citizen for decades. Their movements are very accurate and built to last for many years.



SPECIFICATIONS

Watch case:	316L stainless steel  
Water resistant: 10 ATM, 100 meters  
Glass:	Mineral glass with non scratch surface finishing  
Strap size: 20 mm  
Watch Diameter: 40 mm  
Movement: Miyota 2115 by Citizen  
Strap:	Handmade with genuine italian leather  
Buckle: Stainless steel buckle




Making Prototypes
After we completed the design and finalized the technical drawings, we partnered with manufacturers to create prototypes of the Pegasus Legionarius watch and its unique leather strap. We have established great relationships with reliable suppliers, who helped us greatly communicate exactly what we wanted.


We are convinced that each exclusive watch should be unrepeatable and, therefore, not mass produced. That's why every Pegasus Venezia Watch is hand assembled . You will be assured that you own watch is unique.
Your watch will be packaged with care in our exclusive box. It is handcrafted in Italy by a skilled artisan using only fine walnut wood.


Our box supplier is a leader in the market thanks to the introduction of a revolutionary box shape with rounded angles that make the product more resistant, lighter and better looking. This invention is patent protected.
 The traditional distribution channel is based on different steps, involving extra costs for the final customer. We do things in a different way: we cut this chain. By skipping any intermediary we are able to offer you an exclusive Italian luxury watch at the price of €109.






We are convinced that a consumer should only pay for the quality of the watch and not for all costs related to distribution such as agent fees and traditional retail markup. 
For these reasons we expose all costs we support.






HOW DO I GET ONE?
In order to get your own unique timepiece you have to select the reward you prefer. Don't worry about the color of the strap . You will choose it later.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi this is Taneesha's mom:</p>
<p>To be creators and have the power to produce things that we like and need is of great importance.  Equally important is to practice our awareness of the oneness of all things and go about creating in a way that lends to sustainability and the thriving of all natural systems.</p>
<p>Ever since my daughter showed an interest in designing and sewing we have nurtured it.  She started this journey with crocheting and then moved onto apparel deconstruction (taking my old clothes and creating looks for her baby sister.) </p>
<p>And both of our interest has grown into wanting to create the textiles with eco-friendly fabrics and natural dyes and fully understanding the processes for both.</p>
<p>And to share what we learn...</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Hi this is Taneesha's mom:
To be creators and have the power to produce things that we like and need is of great importance.  Equally important is to practice our awareness of the oneness of all things and go about creating in a way that lends to sustainability and the thriving of all natural systems.
Ever since my daughter showed an interest in designing and sewing we have nurtured it.  She started this journey with crocheting and then moved onto apparel deconstruction (taking my old clothes and creating looks for her baby sister.) 
And both of our interest has grown into wanting to create the textiles with eco-friendly fabrics and natural dyes and fully understanding the processes for both.
And to share what we learn...",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><br/>The global push toward ethical consumerism and sustainable goods is growing, but current availability of varied products is limited and finding reliable information on product origins can be difficult.  It doesn´t make it any easier that small producers and brands are being largely invisible to consumers who would otherwise be motivated to make ethical purchasing choices.<br/><br/><strong>Our mission is to empower underprivileged makers in developing countries by connecting them directly to ethical consumers like you.</strong><br/> </p>

<p>Our company Store of Hope has been running for almost five years now. We started in 2012 with jewelry made by women who lived in a safe house in Nepal. Since then, we have created multiple product families in co-operation with local artisans in several countries.  Our first web store in Finland has helped to grow our reach and we'd love to expand on this success!</p>
<p>Through our work, we have seen first hand how difficult sustainable production and ethical business choices can be, when easier alternatives are everywhere.  B<span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>ringing better opportunities to local artisans and supporting growth in the developing world requires a lot of effort, as does reaching the needed, steady customer base.</span></p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>By offering empowering brands a common platform that consumers trust, we believe all of us can stay focused on the important work all of us have the privilege to do. </span>This is why we are building StoreofHope.com!<br/><br/><strong>You can make an important and meaningful impact.</strong> </p>
<p>With your help we can work towards a more sustainable world.  Your support to our fundraiser means you share our vision for a more equitable world. <strong>It means that you believe in the impact of ethical consuming. </strong> </p>

<p><strong>By building a business that supports producers toward economic independence we believe we can make a long lasting change. </strong><br/><br/><strong>Through our work we want to give local artisans in developing countries opportunities to make their own living and through their work empower their communities to prosper.</strong> That is why all of our products come from small producer groups in the developing world.<br/><br/>Through StoreofHope.com we want to nurture a demand for the skills of talented artisans and makers in different parts of the world.<br/><br/><strong>We know that throughout the world there is a great need for sustainable change, toward more societies where people can make their own living and prosper. </strong>Creating sustainable employment opportunities can permanently lift people out of poverty! <br/>____________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>Through the years we have worked in Nepal building different product lines, we have been searching for a good cashmere manufacturer. Knowing that Nepal is one of the biggest cashmere producers and knowing how great cashmere is in use kept our search on, though it wasn´t simple to find a producer to match our values and ethics. It took multiple trips and visiting several manufacturers to get to this point, but now we are happy to have quality cashmere products that we can proudly bring to our customers. We are glad we made the effort! </p>
<p><br/>Our cashmere products are made by a small Nepalese family business with 21 workers.  We have been working with them for over two years now, and we have been very happy with their work. One of the most important factors for us is that the company takes good care of every employee's well-being and feels passionate about doing so. The business takes pride in paying workers a decent salary, providing good working conditions, and taking care of workers in case of sickness or other problems that may occur in life. </p>
<p>Our cashmere wool comes from goats living in the mountains of central Asia. During the cold winter goats grow a thick underwool that makes cashmere a fine, strong, yet light and soft material.

</div></div>","Hi There!

Our new platform will allow us to expand our outreach to more empowering brands and artisans globally and to strengthen the impact we can have on developing areas across the world. Join us and become a part of our dream to make ethical shopping easy! While we are building storeofhope.com you can order our lovely cashmere products from here. Check out the perks we offer below and choose your favorite!

The global push toward ethical consumerism and sustainable goods is growing, but current availability of varied products is limited and finding reliable information on product origins can be difficult.  It doesn´t make it any easier that small producers and brands are being largely invisible to consumers who would otherwise be motivated to make ethical purchasing choices.Our mission is to empower underprivileged makers in developing countries by connecting them directly to ethical consumers like you. 

Our company Store of Hope has been running for almost five years now. We started in 2012 with jewelry made by women who lived in a safe house in Nepal. Since then, we have created multiple product families in co-operation with local artisans in several countries.  Our first web store in Finland has helped to grow our reach and we'd love to expand on this success!
Through our work, we have seen first hand how difficult sustainable production and ethical business choices can be, when easier alternatives are everywhere.  Bringing better opportunities to local artisans and supporting growth in the developing world requires a lot of effort, as does reaching the needed, steady customer base.
By offering empowering brands a common platform that consumers trust, we believe all of us can stay focused on the important work all of us have the privilege to do. This is why we are building StoreofHope.com!You can make an important and meaningful impact. 
With your help we can work towards a more sustainable world.  Your support to our fundraiser means you share our vision for a more equitable world. It means that you believe in the impact of ethical consuming.  

By building a business that supports producers toward economic independence we believe we can make a long lasting change. Through our work we want to give local artisans in developing countries opportunities to make their own living and through their work empower their communities to prosper. That is why all of our products come from small producer groups in the developing world.Through StoreofHope.com we want to nurture a demand for the skills of talented artisans and makers in different parts of the world.We know that throughout the world there is a great need for sustainable change, toward more societies where people can make their own living and prosper. Creating sustainable employment opportunities can permanently lift people out of poverty! ____________________________________________________________________________

Through the years we have worked in Nepal building different product lines, we have been searching for a good cashmere manufacturer. Knowing that Nepal is one of the biggest cashmere producers and knowing how great cashmere is in use kept our search on, though it wasn´t simple to find a producer to match our values and ethics. It took multiple trips and visiting several manufacturers to get to this point, but now we are happy to have quality cashmere products that we can proudly bring to our customers. We are glad we made the effort! 
Our cashmere products are made by a small Nepalese family business with 21 workers.  We have been working with them for over two years now, and we have been very happy with their work. One of the most important factors for us is that the company takes good care of every employee's well-being and feels passionate about doing so. The business takes pride in paying workers a decent salary, providing good working conditions, and taking care of workers in case of sickness or other problems that may occur in life. 
Our cashmere wool comes from goats living in the mountains of central Asia. During the cold winter goats grow a thick underwool that makes cashmere a fine, strong, yet light and soft material. Cashmere fiber is approximately three times more insulating than sheep wool. The properties of cashmere depend on the humidity of the air, meaning it is suitable for many different climates, even the warm ones. Cashmere works best when mixed with another fiber. That is why we use a combination of 50% lamb wool and 50% cashmere wool which ensures a durable product that will last for years.
