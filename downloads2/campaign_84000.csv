<p><strong>Picture this:</strong></p>
<p>You get the ball rolling on a huge project (second album) and you find out you're pregnant. Four months into this pregnancy, you travel to England to showcase and promote this project and the world shuts down shortly after. You lose your job(s), give birth in a pandemic and are unable to travel to finish this project so you send tracks to your producers, Stuart Cameron (<i>The Heartbroken, Crash Test Dummies</i>) and Peter Fusco (<i>The Heartbroken, Matthew Good</i>), that you've recorded in your bedroom between feedings and naps, all the while figuring out how to be a mother. The road to ""Joan"" has been a long and winding one. </p>
<p>If you don't know already, my name is Alicia Toner and I'm a singer/songwriter living in Charlottetown, PE. Even though Prince Edward Island is my chosen home, I was born and raised in Fredericton, NB, lived in Toronto, ON for 10 years and have travelled all over this country, living in different cities as an actor/musician. </p>
<p>Growing up in Fredericton I was surrounded by music from a young age. I started singing at 5 years old, playing violin at 7 and performing for people probably as soon as I could speak. I was a member of the New Brunswick Youth Orchestra for 4 years and was lucky enough to play Carnegie Hall with them. I started performing in musicals in high school which led me to study Musical Theatre at Sheridan College in Ontario and launched a 10 year career as an actor/musician. I’ve been in shows produced by Mirvish Productions, Soulpepper and the Charlottetown Festival among many others. In 2015, while performing in the Mirvish production of “Once”, I was introduced to Stuart Cameron (<i>The Heartbroken, Crash Test Dummies</i>) and made a sharp left turn in my career. I started recording songs I had written and released my first album, ""I Learned The Hard Way”, produced by Stuart and Peter Fusco (<i>The Heartbroken, Matthew Good</i>). That album earned me a SOCAN Songwriter of the Year award, got some national recognition and some serious radio play, so here we are again. Same producers, same me, better songs. Album number 2.</p>
<p>""Joan"" is something I'm incredibly proud of. I don't say that lightly. I am my toughest critic and to prove it to you I'll say this: looking back, I think my first album is scattered and in-cohesive. I didn't know who I was as a songwriter. I was finding my legs. This new album is grounded and represents a cohesive moment in time. It feels like an experience. I've never been so proud of anything I've done. I cannot wait to share it with you. </p>
<p>The making of ""Joan"" was full of road blocks. These songs have been patient while I secured funding to get this project off the ground and recording started back in October 2019 before I knew if we'd be able to finish it. Stuart Cameron and Peter Fusco once again lent their incredible talents not solely as producers but as the two primary musicians on the album. Peter also engineered many of tracks as well as mixed them all. Dream House Studios, with Engineer Calvin Hartwick, is where we tracked drums (Jody Brumell) and some vocals. Once again, the incomparable Joey Landreth lent his stunning voice and masterful guitar playing to some tracks. This was all accomplished in October 2019 for part of the album. It was then my partner and I found out we were expecting a very different surprise.</p>
<p>The imminent arrival of my daughter, Zoe, put an unexpected twist on the arrival of this album. Not as much of a twist, however, as a global pandemic that left us out of work and unable to get back to Toronto to finish things up. Luckily, technology being what it is these days, ""Joan"" was finished with me in my bedroom tracking vocals and sending them to Toronto. A baby and an album were born.</p>
<p>The name ""Joan"" is a significant one. It's my middle name but many people close to me have used it as my first since I was born. It's a part of me that not everyone gets to see, much like these songs. Calling this album ""Joan"" was my way of self-titling what feels like my debut.  </p>

<p><strong>SO!</strong></p>
<p>Where do you come in? I'm nearly at the finish line with this brain-child of mine, I just need a bit of help getting there. If you decide to become a backer (thank you!), your help will enable me to manufacture physical vinyl and CDs and cover extra marketing costs to get the word out there that this album has arrived. </p>
<p>I need about $5000 to get this album made and properly supported. Here's where your money will go:</p>
<p>-Manufacturing CDs &amp; vinyl </p>
<p>-MERCH - fun things for you to wear and promote the album!</p>
<p>-Sending 3rd single to radio (including delivery/tracking)</p>
<p>-PR for singles &amp; album (press releases, interviews, articles, reviews etc.)</p>
<p>What's in it for you?? I'd never ask for your money without giving you something in return. Think of this as pre-ordering the album so I can make it for you. There is also a long list of perks to choose from if you feel like getting more than the physical copy. Ever wanted a t-shirt with my name on it? Now you can have one! A signed copy of ""Joan"" on vinyl with a love note from me to you? You got it! Feeling super generous and want a private livestream concert for you and your friends within your bubble? Look no more! There are many options and they all come with my ENDLESS thanks and gratitude. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>If you're reading this and you're not in a place to pre-order the album, here's how you can help:</p>
<p><strong>SPREAD THE WORD!</strong></p>
<p>Share this campaign, tell a friend, tell a friend to tell a friend, tell a friend to share this campaign and tell one of their friends... you get the idea. Word of mouth, I believe, is still the best way to promote anything. If I hear it from a friend, I'm 10x more likely to do it. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you've made it this far, thank you. Your support truly does mean the world to me. If you decide to become a backer of this project I'll be keeping you up to date on all things ""Joan"". </p>

My college and grad school life in Taiwan was all about how to push my contemporary playing and how to interpret original composers’ materiel to the next level. I was in a world renowned percussion ensemble called “Ju Percussion Group” and we toured quite often in China, Singapore, Thailand and other Asian countries. The group collaborated with traditional artist in Asia including Peking Opera, dance. I was always fascinated by the two different art forms combined together. I applied these concepts to the tracks “The Path” and “Blossom in a Stormy Night” on this debut album. In 2015 I came to the States to study Jazz music. I was in a grad school program at University of the Arts in Philadelphia. By immersing myself in the Philly Jazz scene and learning the jazz language I started to feel the contrast between my culture and the art form Jazz. I feel that the music of the album is the result of the unique experience of merging two cultures, Taiwanese and American, which sometimes complements and sometimes contradicts each other.  There is courage, insanity and passion combined with Taiwanese lyricism and nostalgia. There is chaos and peace, questions and statements, powerful, delicate, and most of all, the in-depth search for the bigger meaning and truth.” Richie Goods is the producer for this record, he also arranged “Invitation”, “Blue in Green” and “The Path”.</p><p>我從小在台灣長大，一直以來都是演奏古典音樂以及當代打擊樂作品。我在大學和研究所期間，都在鑽研如何把原創者的作品詮釋得淋漓盡致，鞭策自己的演奏能力到極限！我在台灣期間曾為朱宗慶打擊樂團的團員，隨團我在台灣、亞洲各地巡迴演出。團裡演出的內容時常結合京劇鑼鼓、台灣本土元素的音樂以及舞蹈，這些都讓我體會到自身文化下音樂的能量。2015年我來到美國費城，費城為爵士樂重鎮，許多知名的爵士樂手都出於此地，我在當地爵士酒吧與費城本土樂手互相切磋，每天把自己浸淫在爵士樂最真的語彙之中。此張專輯《行》便是集結一路走來所學，體驗過美國與台灣文化之經驗，將此個人經歷譜寫成曲，例如專輯中主打創作曲《行》（The Path）我寫了四台木琴作為序奏，和聲上運用到五聲音階聲響，製造傳統歌謠的聲響色彩。在錄音室，我單獨演奏每個聲部，最後把四個軌道放在一起，變成木琴四重奏，加上大鼓以及鐵琴拉功技法來拓增聲響，使我一人演奏聽起來是整個打擊樂團，序奏拉開後，鋼琴、低音提琴、鼓的加入，讓原本五聲音階氛圍，再也不侷限古典音樂聲響，而是邁入多樂器間不斷溝通對話，碰撞出火花和藉由曲中即興片段展現當下的創造力。</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1594137962/glgem3g27asrs5ura5vg.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Now, I need your help to complete the production for this album.

I am on vibraphone and marimba with Richie Goods - Producer, Acoustic bass and electric bass, Shedrick Mitchell on piano and organ, Allan Mednard on drums, Ismel Wignall on percussion, Jeremy Pelt on trumpet, Quintin Zoto on Guitar, Yoonjin Park on Violin and Phoebe Tsai on Cello. 此張專輯共有12首樂曲，你可以在裡面聽到從靈魂樂鼻祖Roy Ayers到中文老歌改編，爵士八重奏到木琴四重奏，各種不同聲響色彩。我在專輯中演奏鐵琴、木琴，我的製作人是Richie Goods ，他同時也是貝斯手；Shedrick Mitchell 為鋼琴、管風琴手；Allan Mednard 為鼓手；Ismel Wignall為打擊樂手；Jeremy Pelt 為小號手；Quintin Zoto為吉他手；Yoojin Park為小提琴手；Phoebe Tsai為大提琴手。This is my debut album, it’s a completely self-produced project, I’m doing it without the support of a record label. It requires lots of energy to overcome obstacles and challenge myself to handle multi-tasks under limited budget, time and resources. I’m learning so much in this process. Also, the most wonderful thing about making my own record is that I get to talk to every all of you guys. If I have no communication and connection with you all, I wouldn’t be able to make music. So even if you can’t donate, that’s all good. You can just talk to me, send me messages. Or even better, share this project with your friends.這是我的第一張專輯，此張專輯選擇獨立發行，不與唱片公司簽約，一個人獨立發行，除了要克服中間遇到的困難，還得在有限的時間、金錢、資源內創造出最好的音樂並且呈現出來。過程很痛苦，但我也學習到很多，最重要的是，獨立發行創造了一個跟大家連結的機會，如果音樂沒有了人與人之間的溝同、支持、分享、連結，那我覺得我也不用做音樂了，或著說我根本不可能有機會做音樂。所以！你再讀此篇文章時，發覺自己無法捐款，沒關係，幫我分享連結也很棒！或著想要訊息我，也歡迎！I grew up and was raised in Taiwan.  I was a classical/contemporary percussionist. My college and grad school life in Taiwan was all about how to push my contemporary playing and how to interpret original composers’ materiel to the next level. I was in a world renowned percussion ensemble called “Ju Percussion Group” and we toured quite often in China, Singapore, Thailand and other Asian countries. The group collaborated with traditional artist in Asia including Peking Opera, dance. I was always fascinated by the two different art forms combined together. I applied these concepts to the tracks “The Path” and “Blossom in a Stormy Night” on this debut album. In 2015 I came to the States to study Jazz music. I was in a grad school program at University of the Arts in Philadelphia. By immersing myself in the Philly Jazz scene and learning the jazz language I started to feel the contrast between my culture and the art form Jazz. I feel that the music of the album is the result of the unique experience of merging two cultures, Taiwanese and American, which sometimes complements and sometimes contradicts each other.  There is courage, insanity and passion combined with Taiwanese lyricism and nostalgia. There is chaos and peace, questions and statements, powerful, delicate, and most of all, the in-depth search for the bigger meaning and truth.” Richie Goods is the producer for this record, he also arranged “Invitation”, “Blue in Green” and “The Path”.我從小在台灣長大，一直以來都是演奏古典音樂以及當代打擊樂作品。我在大學和研究所期間，都在鑽研如何把原創者的作品詮釋得淋漓盡致，鞭策自己的演奏能力到極限！我在台灣期間曾為朱宗慶打擊樂團的團員，隨團我在台灣、亞洲各地巡迴演出。團裡演出的內容時常結合京劇鑼鼓、台灣本土元素的音樂以及舞蹈，這些都讓我體會到自身文化下音樂的能量。2015年我來到美國費城，費城為爵士樂重鎮，許多知名的爵士樂手都出於此地，我在當地爵士酒吧與費城本土樂手互相切磋，每天把自己浸淫在爵士樂最真的語彙之中。此張專輯《行》便是集結一路走來所學，體驗過美國與台灣文化之經驗，將此個人經歷譜寫成曲，例如專輯中主打創作曲《行》（The Path）我寫了四台木琴作為序奏，和聲上運用到五聲音階聲響，製造傳統歌謠的聲響色彩。在錄音室，我單獨演奏每個聲部，最後把四個軌道放在一起，變成木琴四重奏，加上大鼓以及鐵琴拉功技法來拓增聲響，使我一人演奏聽起來是整個打擊樂團，序奏拉開後，鋼琴、低音提琴、鼓的加入，讓原本五聲音階氛圍，再也不侷限古典音樂聲響，而是邁入多樂器間不斷溝通對話，碰撞出火花和藉由曲中即興片段展現當下的創造力。Now, I need your help to complete the production for this album. I’ve recorded all the music so the funds I raise will be used for the mixing, mastering of the recording, the artwork, CD printing, cover song licensing. And I am also going to produce videos for this music. If I get extra money, it will be used for touring with my band. Here's just the most essential parts of what our price breakdown looks like:為了完成這張專輯，我需要你的幫忙。我已經錄好全部的音樂，所以募資得到的錢，我會用在混音、專輯封面設計、專輯印製費、版權費、樂手費以及宣傳之影片。如果有餘款，則會直接用在支持我的樂團日後巡迴演出的費用上，在此我提供款項之用途及項目：  
Cover Song licensing（版權費）: $1,000
Studios & instrument rental（錄音室及樂器租借）: $3,100
Artwork and graphic motion（專輯封面設計費及音樂影像製作費）: $3,000

Mastering（混音）: $1,000

<p>I have been studying at The Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, PA for the past three years and was previously at The Juilliard School, McGill University. </p>
<p>Music has always been a huge part of my life. My mom always had music playing in the background everywhere around the house when I was growing up.

<p>Learning for students has been extremely difficult due to the pandemic, where many students may have found themselves feeling disconnected and falling behind in their work. So that is when I asked myself, </p>
<h3>""How can music encourage a love of learning and reading?""</h3>
<p>This program was created around this question of fostering creativity, love, and curiosity for music and literacy education. </p>
<p>With the help of six guest artists, we will break down the basic story elements (character, plot, setting, and conflict/resolution) in both books and music. The students will write their own short story and composition that goes along with their story. There will be a final concert at the end of the program where the students will be able to share their stories and compositions with friends and family. </p>

As noted above: full finding allows all who want to participate in the recording and entertainment field to do so from all over the world.  The discovery of this new music and artists will be distributed out to the world on our global media platforms.  In differentiation to other like programs, STARBREAKERS' artists will not just be recognized as gifted artists.  Our various programs will have a ripple effect as their performances and music will be aired on radio/TV and on-demand programs.  Their music will be distributed globally and they will be marketed to promoters and venues for parties and events.  These shows will accommodate them unprecedented celebrity usually only available through major labels. The anticipated success of these artists will provide the building blocks of businesses revolved around recorded music and open same business opportunities for those who are not front-line entertainers. 
 Previously stated, this is a new experience in entertainment.  Tapped from the bottom up, the cream will rise to the top and you will be the cause and the beneficiary of it all.   This showcase not only impacts the artists involved, but will give an unprecedented opportunity to the many start-up radio stations, TV programs, events born as a spinoff out of this campaign plus a new rank of celebrity personalities and hosts.  These will be listed below.    Risks & Challenges The risks and challenges are extremely low for this type of campaign. Most of the crew who will be working with us have put together their entertainment operations mostly with their own out-of-pocket funding and have not been provided the opportunity or outlet to work collectively as a future business model due to corporate and/or traditional business models.  This format eliminates most of these issues and the funding erases the bulk of technical expenses.

Soy Loreto González Lorca; Loreto Lorca.I was born in Santiago, Chile at the feet of the Andes mountains and since I was a child I started the search for  the Spirit.Nací en Santiago de Chile a los pies de la cordillera de los Andes y desde pequeña comencé la búsqueda de lo que nunca se va: el espíritu.I always knew that my misión was to give  music and songs to the world, I became a singer songwriter and voice teacher. I have  created the Voice Workshop at the Rock Schools and taught thousands of students all along Chile.Siempre supe que mi misión en el mundo era entregar mis canciones y mi música, por eso me convertí en cantautora y maestra de canto, creando el taller de voz en las Escuelas de Rock y enseñando a miles de alumnos en Chile .I like to collaborate with people, and I have created solidarity campaigns  in our numerous earthquakes. My favorite was: Walking Together ""Caminando Juntos"", where we sent new shoes to children and the elderly most affected by my land´s earthquake in 2010.Creo en la colaboración entre personas, por eso he realizado y participado en campañas para ayudar  en los tantos terremotos que han remecido mi tierra, como por ejemplo Caminando Juntos, donde enviamos zapatos y calcetines nuevos a niños y ancianos afectados por el sismo del 27 de febrero de 2010.I am a singer & songwriter since I was 13, I now  have hundreds of  songs. I invite you to listen to some of them in my Soundcloud.Compongo desde los 13 años y cuento con más de 100 canciones.Puedes escuchar algunas de éstas en mi Soundcloud
Quotes""In this exquisite music Taj Loreto sings the epic story of her dramatic land, Chile, while also telling us of the journey of the Soul.  Her music heals our Earth and returns magic to the heart of humanity!”  En ésta deliciosa música Taj Loreto canta la historia épica de su dramática tierra, Chile, mientras tanto nos cuenta también del viaje del alma. Su música sana la Tierra y devuelve la magia al corazón de la humanidad” Sharifa Oppenheimer www.ourheavenonearth.netEach song on this album is an exquisitely crafted gem. Loreto Lorca is a master melodist and storyteller."" “Cada canción de este álbum es una joya exquisitamente tallada Loreto Lorca es una maestra melódica y una “cuentacuentos.””Bisan Toronwww.bisantoron.com“For her lyrical proposal, Loreto tells us a story that placesher, because of  her message, as a citizen of the world ""Musician & journalist Andrés Lecaros. http://www.andreslecaros.cl/ “Para su propuesta lírica, Loreto expone un estilo de narración, que la sitúa, en base a su mensaje, como una ciudadana del mundo”.

In each place I  emerged  in its music & culture, thus, my music is from everywhere. My songs talk  about reconciliation, my city, the awakening of humanity, my desire to unify the american heart, about the elements of nature, about love in its many forms.Comencé a viajar a los 17 años por Chile y luego recorrí Norteamérica y Sudamérica, conociendo Brasil, Argentina, Perú, Bolivia, Estados Unidos, y en cada lugar me impregné de su música y cultura, por eso mis canciones son del mundo, es decir World Music.Mis canciones hablan de reconciliación, de mi ciudad, del despertar de la humanidad, de mi anhelo de unir el corazón americano, de los elementos de la naturaleza y del amor en sus tantas formas.These last years I realize I was doing many things, but no what I most love and what my mission in life was: my music. So I decided to do it. I started the pre production of a CD with 12 of my songs, and here began the task of creating a team to do it.Two years ago we started the pre production of VIENTO AZUL; Blue Wind, with an extraordinary team of chilean artists, musical arranger, 5 young and tremendous musicians, designer, film maker, sound engineers etc. One of these artists is the chilean painter René Olivares  artist  of Los Jaivas covers (chilean Grateful Dead) .Estos últimos años me di cuenta que estaba haciendo muchas cosas pero no lo que más amo y aquello que es mi misión en la vida hacer: mi música. Entonces me propuse hacer un disco con 12 de mis canciones y así es como comenzó la tarea de formar un equipo para realizarlo.Hace 2 años iniciamos la producción de VIENTO AZUL,con un equipo extraordinario de artistas chilenos, arreglador, músicos, director audiovisual y muchos más. Uno de estos artistas es el pintor chileno René Olivares, realizador de las portadas de los discos de Los Jaivas, quien se encargó de hacer también el arte de este disco.I sing because it is  vital  for me and I want to share my songs with the world…
I invite you to be part of the creation of Viento Azul, debut álbum of twelve original songs.Canto porque es una necesidad vital para mí y quiero compartirlo con el mundo.Te invito a ser parte de mi obra VIENTO AZUL, álbum debut de 12 canciones originales.In the creation of this CD, this wonderful group of musicians are my companions:En la realización de esta obra, me acompañan excelentes músicos:

<span>“From
the first fiery note to the last whispery phrase, Christine Rosander’s voice
grabs hold and doesn’t let go, stirring up yearning and desire long after a
song has ended.”</span><span> <br/></span></b></i></p><p><b><span>Vocalist Christine Rosander has the kind of
voice that makes you want to laugh, cry and even shout a “Hallelujah!” or two.
Her sultry mix of gospel — honed by a childhood of singing in church choir —
country, folk, and jazz, warms the spirit with a captivating, earthy power.</span></b><i><b><span><br/>
</span><span></span></b></i></p>The soundtrack to Christine Rosander’s life started before she was born, her mother a piano teacher and singer, pregnant with her when she was a voice major in college. Christine grew up in northern California near Sacramento, the beginning of the Sierra Nevada Mountains in the distance, her family’s church, Elk Grove First Baptist, where Christine went to Wednesday night prayer meetings, Sunday morning and evening services, her father a driving force in attendance. It was there she learned, getting the congregation ready to hear the sermon by singing to the top of the church rafters, that music healed, music made hurting souls well. She had found the power of music.<br/><br/>Years later, when she was introduced to jazz, she remembered back to a Sunday night church service and Mr. Stan Hagstrom singing, “There is a Balm in Gilead,” which inspired Christine to do a jazz version on her first album, “Smooth Ride,” earning an “Independent Female Vocalist of the Year” nomination from the Los Angeles Music Awards.<p><br/></p><p>Christine’s memories of luck and finding a person that inspires you came from meeting Mrs. Perla Warren, a much-loved Filipino concert pianist and teacher who, because of her brilliance, her passion for jazz and for life, changed Christine’s life forever. She loved the improvisation and styling in jazz, loved that she could take a song and make it her own, tell her story through her own truths and intuitions, and become the Artist she wanted to be.<br/></p><p>Yet truths, sometimes, are difficult to tell, many of their effects long lasting and painful. Words like betrayal or violence, words like doubt. But where do songs come from, where does art come from? From sadness and loss and often from the worst times in our lives, from fear and broken promises---soul damage. But also from inspiration and transformation, she told herself, from singing to the rafters and moving on.
</p><p>Christine Rosander’s latest single, <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/been-a-long-time-single/id816378818"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Been a Long Time”</a> celebrates her grandfather Ray Rosander and the need we all have to connect with each other. “I was thinking about who anchors us to family, to love and who connects us to the earth. For me that person was my Grandpa Ray. He was a simple man, a farmer, but he taught so much about life by his example. He had a friendly, easy-going way and a deep spiritual love of life. He wasn’t tied to material things. Connecting with his memory has been restorative.</p>
<p><b><i>“I’ve realized that everything good about my life, everything important to me, has nothing anymore to do with painful memories or experiences. I am whole and wonderful and loved without them. I have been transformed in many ways. I believe in myself and write songs. I regain my self-worth. I remember who I am and all I have to offer the world. I remember my parents and grandparents, my childhood and the legacies left me, remember my roots and family, special and wonderful. I remember the artists I listened to and loved and was guided by, as I hope to guide others. This is where I come from, this is my hope, my commitment, my authentic self.” </i></b></p>
<p>Christine earned a bachelor’s degree in Vocal Performance and Commercial Composing and Arranging from Cal State Long Beach and later became the first vocalist to earn a master’s degree from USC in Jazz Studies. Currently she lives in Los Angeles working as a professional singer, musician, teacher and songwriter and is busy doing an IndieGogo campaign to make her latest album, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGC7yZ_zPJ8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Been a Long Time"".</a><br/></p>
<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGC7yZ_zPJ8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“Been a Long Time”</a> is my prayer for listeners. I hope they experience the healing power of music and are reminded of what is really important in life — the people we love and how we can make a difference in the world. Producing the music video for ""Been a Long Time"" brought the song to life in an even more powerful way. We used old film clips of my grandfather interwoven with those of my dad. The story, location and music came together effortlessly. I truly felt Spirit at work.”</p><br/><p></p><strong></strong><br/><p></p></div>","Singing My Story...And Yours!

Bio: Christine Rosander




“From
the first fiery note to the last whispery phrase, Christine Rosander’s voice
grabs hold and doesn’t let go, stirring up yearning and desire long after a
song has ended.” Vocalist Christine Rosander has the kind of
voice that makes you want to laugh, cry and even shout a “Hallelujah!” or two.
Her sultry mix of gospel — honed by a childhood of singing in church choir —
country, folk, and jazz, warms the spirit with a captivating, earthy power.
The soundtrack to Christine Rosander’s life started before she was born, her mother a piano teacher and singer, pregnant with her when she was a voice major in college. Christine grew up in northern California near Sacramento, the beginning of the Sierra Nevada Mountains in the distance, her family’s church, Elk Grove First Baptist, where Christine went to Wednesday night prayer meetings, Sunday morning and evening services, her father a driving force in attendance. It was there she learned, getting the congregation ready to hear the sermon by singing to the top of the church rafters, that music healed, music made hurting souls well. She had found the power of music.Years later, when she was introduced to jazz, she remembered back to a Sunday night church service and Mr. Stan Hagstrom singing, “There is a Balm in Gilead,” which inspired Christine to do a jazz version on her first album, “Smooth Ride,” earning an “Independent Female Vocalist of the Year” nomination from the Los Angeles Music Awards.Christine’s memories of luck and finding a person that inspires you came from meeting Mrs. Perla Warren, a much-loved Filipino concert pianist and teacher who, because of her brilliance, her passion for jazz and for life, changed Christine’s life forever. She loved the improvisation and styling in jazz, loved that she could take a song and make it her own, tell her story through her own truths and intuitions, and become the Artist she wanted to be.Yet truths, sometimes, are difficult to tell, many of their effects long lasting and painful. Words like betrayal or violence, words like doubt. But where do songs come from, where does art come from? From sadness and loss and often from the worst times in our lives, from fear and broken promises---soul damage. But also from inspiration and transformation, she told herself, from singing to the rafters and moving on.
Christine Rosander’s latest single, “Been a Long Time” celebrates her grandfather Ray Rosander and the need we all have to connect with each other. “I was thinking about who anchors us to family, to love and who connects us to the earth. For me that person was my Grandpa Ray. He was a simple man, a farmer, but he taught so much about life by his example. He had a friendly, easy-going way and a deep spiritual love of life. He wasn’t tied to material things. Connecting with his memory has been restorative.
“I’ve realized that everything good about my life, everything important to me, has nothing anymore to do with painful memories or experiences. I am whole and wonderful and loved without them. I have been transformed in many ways. I believe in myself and write songs. I regain my self-worth. I remember who I am and all I have to offer the world. I remember my parents and grandparents, my childhood and the legacies left me, remember my roots and family, special and wonderful. I remember the artists I listened to and loved and was guided by, as I hope to guide others. This is where I come from, this is my hope, my commitment, my authentic self.” 
Christine earned a bachelor’s degree in Vocal Performance and Commercial Composing and Arranging from Cal State Long Beach and later became the first vocalist to earn a master’s degree from USC in Jazz Studies. Currently she lives in Los Angeles working as a professional singer, musician, teacher and songwriter and is busy doing an IndieGogo campaign to make her latest album, ""Been a Long Time"".
“Been a Long Time” is my prayer for listeners. I hope they experience the healing power of music and are reminded of what is really important in life — the people we love and how we can make a difference in the world. Producing the music video for ""Been a Long Time"" brought the song to life in an even more powerful way. We used old film clips of my grandfather interwoven with those of my dad. The story, location and music came together effortlessly. I truly felt Spirit at work.”",3.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>So, who's the guy with the guitar? </h3>
<p>My name is Tom Ciorciari and for the past nine years I've been 
writing and recording under the nom du rock, Deerheart. I was part of 
both NYC's Paisley Underground and Boston's Garage Punk scenes in the 
80's, and did the singer-songwriter thing in the 90's, all the while 
accumulating a strong backlog of material that would eventually find an 
outlet when I started releasing albums as Deerheart in 2007. Since then 
there have been seven Deerheart releases, and a steadily-growing 
audience via radio play, social media and solo performances in and 
around New York area. 
</p>
<p>Over the past nine months I've been hard at it, recording a new 
album, and putting a rock solid band together to get it out to the 
public. And that's where this campaign comes in...

</p>
<h3>What's he need &amp; what's it for? And who's Elsie?
</h3>
<p>Deerheart has always been a DIY project. It's always just been me 
writing, recording and performing everything; producing, mixing, you get
 the idea. But these 12 new songs are very possibly the best I've 
written; songs of love, songs of desperation and, ultimately, songs of 
triumph. Songs that reverberate, that get to the heart of the matter, as
 someone once said. Songs that I believe in. Songs ""Fer Elsie..."", as the title has it. And with a new band ready 
to take these songs to a larger audience it's time to bring things up to
 the next level and have this album professionally mixed and mastered. 
For <b>$2800</b> we can do that and get the album out to you, and continue to grow our audience. <br/></p>
<h3>Other ways you can help!</h3>
<p>I know that not everyone has the ability to contribute financially, but there are other ways you can contribute...</p>

<p><b style=""background-color: initial;"">Music The Universal Language of the Soul:</b></p><p><b style=""background-color: initial;"">
</b></p><p>Hello, my name is Julio L. Matta. I'm
a Native New Yorker from the South Bronx, of Hispanic Origin. A
songwriter, composer, percussionist, keyboardist, producer of Pop, Latin Pop,
R&amp;B, Jazz Fusion, Afro-Cuban, Adult Contemporary, Love Ballads,
Pop/Country, Instrumental, Urban/R&amp;B, World, and Soft Rock music.  I would greatly appreciate your support and donations to help me reach my funding goals to make this dream come true.  Not only will your donation help me complete my debut Album and put us closer to producing our music video, you will be joining me in advocating the importance of Immigration Reform to help bring out those living in the shadows who deserve a chance at achieving the American Dream.  As
a musician I've been blessed with over 25 years of extensive experience
performing with many well-known artists throughout the United States, Puerto
Rico, and Europe.  Artist such as: 
Jon Akkerman; Marilyn McCoo &amp; Billy Davis Jr.; Klaus Dordinger; Donna
Summers, Gato Barbieri; Lou Rawls; Willie Colon, Justo Betancourt; and
many others.  I began my musical endeavors at the young age of 14 in New
York City.  At the age of 18, I was drafted and served in the United
States Army and after 12 years of service, I decided to return to college
acquiring several Degrees, which includes an MBA.  During this same time
period, I also worked as a Civil Rights Practitioner for the Federal Government
in several Federal agencies.  As a Public Servant, I held the positions of
Director of Civil Rights for the U. S. Marine Corps at the Pentagon, Director
of Civil Rights, for the United States Merit Systems Protection Board, which
was the old Civil Service Commission, Senior Enforcement Investigator for both
the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and Wage and Hour
Division of the U. S. Department of Labor, and ended my Federal Civil Service
career at the US Department of Labor as the Deputy Chief of Enforcement
for Civil Rights in Washington, DC.  </p>
<p>The diversity of music that I have learned
and performed, nurtured by people with a vast cultural history; are all
joined by a universal language, which is music.    This experience
coupled with the responsibility of protecting the Civil and
Labor Rights of thousands of individuals throughout the United States; has
enrich my soul by serving and protecting my fellow American brothers and
sisters of all races, sex, age, religion, sexual preferences, disabilities,
color and nationalities.  My journey has been serving and protecting the
children of generations of Exiles and Immigrants; seeds conceived in
America but its roots touching the world hungry with hope for prosperity,
and freedom.</p>
<p><b>The Drive and Vision:</b></p>
<p>I love people, period.   Yes, we will
all go through life meeting up with some who just don't get it.  But that
is your choice to accept or protest, and I protested by getting into the
trenches overseas, and here right at home.  I love people because the
majority of those individuals that have touch my life musically or otherwise;
no matter what nationality or cultural difference we had as individuals, were
intelligent, decent, hardworking people all looking for the same thing; to
better themselves as an individuals and insure the safety, and prosperity for
their families.   As a Musician, Disabled Veteran, Public Servant, and
Cancer Survivor, as I am sure hundreds have asked; {why and how have we
encourage divisiveness?}  It tears at the very essence of my soul.  </p>
<p><b>The Drive:</b></p>
<p>Understanding a little bit about who I am, in
someway or another, musically or publicly, people have and continue to be the center of my
journey through life.   My drive; as a man, a veteran, public servant;
Hispanic; and yes American born; we are slowly walking away from who we are,
what we stand for, most importantly; what so many of our children through
generations of Exile, and Immigrants have died to ensure the beacon of hope,
prosperity and freedom never dies.  We must never allow that sacred
promise be broken to any decent man, woman or child who seeks the protection of
our Sentinel; Our Guardian of Freedom, Our Mother Of Exiles.  
 Although, this is my first album, and musical project I have many stories
to tell.  Stories based on the diverse life I have lived among so many
cultures; difficulties, desires, and hopes that makes us all the same.  We
The Children were promised; in writing to bear witness, and in blood defending
to secure an establishment of Justice, domestic tranquility, defend and promote
the general Welfare, and insure the Children's security of liberty for
themselves, and their Posterity.  Posterity; this is where we are missing
the point in my opinion, the promise does not end with us, it is secured
bearing witness and blood for all future generations to come, and live as one
people; <b>"" E PLURIBUS UNUM"" ""OUT OF MANY, ONE""   </b>We should never adapt a political posture where people are held back from hope and prosperity because of their religion, race or color of their skin.  History has shown us that unity is the survival and strength of any great team, organization and yes a progressive and great country.  </p>
<p><b>Vision: </b></p>
<p>I need your help to continue to communicate
the best way I know about what I have seen and experienced.  I need your
support to bring to life a dream over 25 years in the making, an Album diverse
in genres, rich in stories of love, sadness, triumph, and the life of many.
  I ask for your support and participation in this two-stage project
called <b>""Mother Of Exiles"".  </b></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">The </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">Mother of Exiles Project </b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">is a
Two Stage Project.  Stage one is to seek your support to complete our
first debut Album.  Musically, is non-genre specific, stemming from Love
Ballads, Pop/Rock, Latin Fusion, R&amp;B, World, and our title song Mother Of
Exiles.  The title song ""</span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">Mother of Exiles,""</b><span style=""background-color: initial;""> talks
about how immigration starts in the U.S. though Ellis Island, and the
significance of the Statute of Liberty to us and for the world.  The song tells a compelling and gripping story on how Exiles and Immigrants have built
and fought for this country and are still fighting to this day, and how
politics has taken such a terrible turn on this important issue.  To
achieve the first stage of the project we need your support to raise </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">$8,500.00.</b><span style=""background-color: initial;""> The
first stage is to complete the Album.  Some of the songs for the Album are
recorded, but as an independent musician, with no budget; needed marketing has
been difficult, and for this reason they will become part of the </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">Mother
Of Exiles</b><span style=""background-color: initial;""> Album project.  There are four additional songs, one being
the title song </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">""Mother Of Exiles."" </b><span style=""background-color: initial;""> </span><br/></p>
<p>As mentioned the title song <b>Mother of
Exiles</b> has been recorded and we are looking to build a Fan Base of
core supporters; interested parties; musicians, celebrities, corporate sponsors
to help us Market the Single, participate with us to raise awareness on the
importance of immigration and how it has, and will continue to strengthen our
country, as well as your generous support to help us raise the needed capital to complete the
Album.    The Single, <b>Mother of Exiles</b> is up-tempo,
and presents a real political issue that effects us all through music in a
positive way, without negativity or encouraging divisiveness making the song,
and production inclusive for all.  It's the song about us and the many generations before us!  
 It's the song of the children of America past and present ""our
posterity"" of generations that have safeguarded this country so it may
never ceases to be the country of hope, prosperity, freedom and peace for all. </p>
<p> Without your generous financial
support, and getting involved with us <b>""The Julio Matta
Project""</b> joining and expanding a global Fan Club, and expanding our voices, the
dream of completing the <b>Mother Of Exiles </b>Album would be
difficult.  We would miss an opportunity ""as one people"" through
beautiful music; and future Freedom and Unity Concerts, wherever allowed;
to come together and speak out on this serious issues of Immigration happening right here
right now.  We need your financial support, and help to build our Fan Base
to get involved with us and help us advocate throughout the United States,
and around the world; that America will forever stand as the land where the poor, those forced by tyranny to flee their lands yearning to breathe free, seeking hope, prosperity and peace; will always see our Sentinel's light
guiding her children to the shores of freedom.  </p>

<p><b>Will your generous
financial support help us distribute the Single worldwide so others can
participate financially and support our campaign to complete the Mother Of
Exiles Album and move on to Stage II?</b></p>
<p><b>Ariella Records</b> is among one of the fastest
growing companies with offices in Canada, California, Zurich, and Switzerland.
 Distribution, Marketing and Artist development is just some of the services
this Artist- friendly company owed by Jason and Mandi Lafauci have helped
scores of new artist get their music heard around the world.   Without
your generous donations we would not have the funds to pay for the
above-mentioned necessities to complete our first stage and produce a stunning
professional, great sounding Album, as we market our new Single ""<b>Mother
Of Exiles.""</b>  You can hear our new Single at:  
</p><p><a href=""https://www.reverbnation.com/q/6m0lb4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.reverbnation.com/q/6m0lb4</a></p>

Your support will not only help us market the single
and complete the Album, your support is key to help us reach our initial
financial goal of <b>$8,500.00</b>, while we prepare ourselves for the second stage, which is the
production of the <b>Mother Of Exiles</b> music video.  Stage
two will be a separate campaign, but in advance, we would greatly appreciate
for those who may be in a position to provide generous contributions to help us
move that much close to hiring the production team needed to finalize the
script that will tell this story, and to complete the production of the music
video which will bring the <b>Mother of Exiles </b>to life for all to
participate and enjoy.  It is our story!!      

<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>I've worked in recording studios on projects
in the past.  On those occasions, the project was always defined by the
budget, which is almost always costly.  Now, I've been given this
incredibly, spiritual enriched opportunity to share, and continue advocating
for those who can not advocate for themselves through music; but I cannot ask
the musicians and engineers involved to commit their reputations and careers
without making it the best it can be.  And that costs big bucks! </p>
<p>The project will also give musicians,
songwriters, singers, producers, scriptwriters; video/film production
companies; known artist; celebrities; corporations, TV and Radio Hosts, Fans, and
generous donors the opportunity to get involved and help us reach our goals and bring the issue of Immigration to the forefront.
  Additionally, with your support we can continue to grow our worldwide
Fan Base, which is key to our success.   One of the goals of this
campaign is to reach like-minded people for collaboration, raise money in
exchange for early access; rewards, and Perks you can used daily or exhibit proudly for participating in this musical movement.  We also want to spread the word
through your participation on a global scale because the issue of ""Immigration"" is important and global.  The more people we can get involved in this
campaign to support us by purchasing our <b>“Mother Of Exiles""</b> Single, which will help us raise the capital for the second part of our musical journey (the production of our Mother Of Exiles music video), your support to complete the Album will enhance our chances of succeeding in reaching
people everywhere, and anywhere around the world so they can also
participate in this social and musical movement, and financially help us reach
our goals. </p>
<p>Our campaign will give you the basics on our
efforts through videos and electronic correspondence showing or indicating the
different stages of the project’s progression.  Beyond that we encourage
you to ask us questions, donate and get involved.  We developed the
""Mother of Exiles"" to have the benefit of talking about this
important issue of immigration through music, so get involved, let us tell your
story, and enjoy making history!  We believe we are really onto an easier
way to face political and social issues with the grace and ease of music. </p>
<p><b>THIS IS HAPPENING!!! </b> With the help of Ariella Records, we envision the
distribution and sells of our Single <b>""Mother Of Exiles” </b>to being in June 2016. The
distribution and sales of our Single coupled with your generous donations will
provide us with the financial support we need to continue working on the
Album's completion.   We will begin recording the rest of the Album, as
well as mixing and mastering starting on or about end of June 2016 through
November 2016 with musicians from Arlington, VA, Maryland, Florida, California, and Puerto
Rico.  Here again, your generous financial support will allow us to bring
these A list musicians to our Studio in VA, or travel to the needed locations
to meet up with our A list musicians and guest artist that are not residents of
Maryland.    As stated, we plan to expand the scoring of our recorded
songs, expand the musical scoring for the music video Mother Of Exiles, with
several fantastic arrangers, some of which are donating their time.  But
writing out all the charts, as well as hiring top session players, securing a
top studio and engineer, and
all the mixing and mastering for a project of this quality is an extremely
expensive undertaking.  Still, it's one that I believe so many will be
touched by the message of the song, for which I cordially ask for your support,
participation and donations.  </p>
<p><b>Join Us and help us bring Mother of Exiles to a reality:</b></p>
<p>1) We ask you to support us by buying our
Single to keep the message alive and the project moving forward, 2) Have you
ever thought about using music to express yourself, 3) Do you want to be part
of a music revolution that is bigger than anything you have ever been part of,
4) Are you interested in facing issues that have stood the test of time through
beautiful music, 5) Are you a professional musician, singer, videographer,
scriptwriter, music producer, film/video producer, corporation, celebrity
or TV/Radio Host who believes in getting involved in social issues, 6) Is music
the voice you love to express and share with individuals like myself on
important issues such as immigration.  If so, we ask you to become part of
our Core Support Team, get involved, buy our Single and/or donate and participate and support
us.  Your donations will be greatly appreciated and used to complete this
first stage of this project.  If you could afford a little bit more, my

bit more closer and again for that I sincerely appreciate your involvement.</p>

<br/></div>","Music The Universal Language of the Soul:
Hello, my name is Julio L. Matta. I'm
a Native New Yorker from the South Bronx, of Hispanic Origin. A
songwriter, composer, percussionist, keyboardist, producer of Pop, Latin Pop,
R&B, Jazz Fusion, Afro-Cuban, Adult Contemporary, Love Ballads,
Pop/Country, Instrumental, Urban/R&B, World, and Soft Rock music.  I would greatly appreciate your support and donations to help me reach my funding goals to make this dream come true.  Not only will your donation help me complete my debut Album and put us closer to producing our music video, you will be joining me in advocating the importance of Immigration Reform to help bring out those living in the shadows who deserve a chance at achieving the American Dream.  As
a musician I've been blessed with over 25 years of extensive experience
performing with many well-known artists throughout the United States, Puerto
Rico, and Europe.  Artist such as: 
Jon Akkerman; Marilyn McCoo & Billy Davis Jr.; Klaus Dordinger; Donna
Summers, Gato Barbieri; Lou Rawls; Willie Colon, Justo Betancourt; and
many others.  I began my musical endeavors at the young age of 14 in New
York City.  At the age of 18, I was drafted and served in the United
States Army and after 12 years of service, I decided to return to college
acquiring several Degrees, which includes an MBA.  During this same time
period, I also worked as a Civil Rights Practitioner for the Federal Government
in several Federal agencies.  As a Public Servant, I held the positions of
Director of Civil Rights for the U. S. Marine Corps at the Pentagon, Director
of Civil Rights, for the United States Merit Systems Protection Board, which
was the old Civil Service Commission, Senior Enforcement Investigator for both
the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and Wage and Hour
Division of the U. S. Department of Labor, and ended my Federal Civil Service
career at the US Department of Labor as the Deputy Chief of Enforcement
for Civil Rights in Washington, DC.  
The diversity of music that I have learned
and performed, nurtured by people with a vast cultural history; are all
joined by a universal language, which is music.    This experience
coupled with the responsibility of protecting the Civil and
Labor Rights of thousands of individuals throughout the United States; has
enrich my soul by serving and protecting my fellow American brothers and
sisters of all races, sex, age, religion, sexual preferences, disabilities,
color and nationalities.  My journey has been serving and protecting the
children of generations of Exiles and Immigrants; seeds conceived in
America but its roots touching the world hungry with hope for prosperity,
and freedom.
The Drive and Vision:
I love people, period.   Yes, we will
all go through life meeting up with some who just don't get it.  But that
is your choice to accept or protest, and I protested by getting into the
trenches overseas, and here right at home.  I love people because the
majority of those individuals that have touch my life musically or otherwise;
no matter what nationality or cultural difference we had as individuals, were
intelligent, decent, hardworking people all looking for the same thing; to
better themselves as an individuals and insure the safety, and prosperity for
their families.   As a Musician, Disabled Veteran, Public Servant, and
Cancer Survivor, as I am sure hundreds have asked; {why and how have we
encourage divisiveness?}  It tears at the very essence of my soul.  
The Drive:
Understanding a little bit about who I am, in
someway or another, musically or publicly, people have and continue to be the center of my
journey through life.   My drive; as a man, a veteran, public servant;
Hispanic; and yes American born; we are slowly walking away from who we are,
what we stand for, most importantly; what so many of our children through
generations of Exile, and Immigrants have died to ensure the beacon of hope,
prosperity and freedom never dies.  We must never allow that sacred
promise be broken to any decent man, woman or child who seeks the protection of
our Sentinel; Our Guardian of Freedom, Our Mother Of Exiles.  
 Although, this is my first album, and musical project I have many stories
to tell.  Stories based on the diverse life I have lived among so many
cultures; difficulties, desires, and hopes that makes us all the same.  We
The Children were promised; in writing to bear witness, and in blood defending
to secure an establishment of Justice, domestic tranquility, defend and promote
the general Welfare, and insure the Children's security of liberty for
themselves, and their Posterity.  Posterity; this is where we are missing
the point in my opinion, the promise does not end with us, it is secured
bearing witness and blood for all future generations to come, and live as one
people; "" E PLURIBUS UNUM"" ""OUT OF MANY, ONE""   We should never adapt a political posture where people are held back from hope and prosperity because of their religion, race or color of their skin.  History has shown us that unity is the survival and strength of any great team, organization and yes a progressive and great country.  
Vision: 
I need your help to continue to communicate
the best way I know about what I have seen and experienced.  I need your
support to bring to life a dream over 25 years in the making, an Album diverse
in genres, rich in stories of love, sadness, triumph, and the life of many.
  I ask for your support and participation in this two-stage project
called ""Mother Of Exiles"".  
The Mother of Exiles Project is a
Two Stage Project.  Stage one is to seek your support to complete our
first debut Album.  Musically, is non-genre specific, stemming from Love
Ballads, Pop/Rock, Latin Fusion, R&B, World, and our title song Mother Of
Exiles.  The title song ""Mother of Exiles,"" talks
about how immigration starts in the U.S. though Ellis Island, and the
significance of the Statute of Liberty to us and for the world.  The song tells a compelling and gripping story on how Exiles and Immigrants have built
and fought for this country and are still fighting to this day, and how
politics has taken such a terrible turn on this important issue.  To
achieve the first stage of the project we need your support to raise $8,500.00. The
first stage is to complete the Album.  Some of the songs for the Album are
recorded, but as an independent musician, with no budget; needed marketing has
been difficult, and for this reason they will become part of the Mother
Of Exiles Album project.  There are four additional songs, one being
the title song ""Mother Of Exiles.""  
As mentioned the title song Mother of
Exiles has been recorded and we are looking to build a Fan Base of
core supporters; interested parties; musicians, celebrities, corporate sponsors
to help us Market the Single, participate with us to raise awareness on the
importance of immigration and how it has, and will continue to strengthen our
country, as well as your generous support to help us raise the needed capital to complete the
Album.    The Single, Mother of Exiles is up-tempo,
and presents a real political issue that effects us all through music in a
positive way, without negativity or encouraging divisiveness making the song,
and production inclusive for all.  It's the song about us and the many generations before us!  
 It's the song of the children of America past and present ""our
posterity"" of generations that have safeguarded this country so it may
never ceases to be the country of hope, prosperity, freedom and peace for all. 
 Without your generous financial
support, and getting involved with us ""The Julio Matta
Project"" joining and expanding a global Fan Club, and expanding our voices, the
dream of completing the Mother Of Exiles Album would be
difficult.  We would miss an opportunity ""as one people"" through
beautiful music; and future Freedom and Unity Concerts, wherever allowed;
to come together and speak out on this serious issues of Immigration happening right here
right now.  We need your financial support, and help to build our Fan Base
to get involved with us and help us advocate throughout the United States,
and around the world; that America will forever stand as the land where the poor, those forced by tyranny to flee their lands yearning to breathe free, seeking hope, prosperity and peace; will always see our Sentinel's light
guiding her children to the shores of freedom.  
Your contribution and participation is the
lifeline to my project and dream.  What we need:
Your support to help us raise our initial
$8,500.00 will allow us to:

Establish
     worldwide distribution for sells of our Single: Mother Of Exiles;
Completing
     the musical scoring for the four new song left to record, and expansion of
     the musical scores for the music video production in Stage II of our
     project, 
Studio
     time is expensive and we need to complete our recording not only in a
     great studio, but also have great engineering,
Many
     of the songs will be recorded with live Strings, and Horn Sections, as
     well as professional singers will also help us complete the production,
Marketing
     and Promotion
Artwork
     and Design
Videographer
     so we can continue to document the progress of the project and keep
     everyone up to date.  You will see the project as it comes together
     because of your generous donations through our website, YouTube, and
     social media, 
We
     will have musical guest to expand our live recording capabilities and future
     performances, 
Mixing
     and mastering, which is expensive but essential to the finish
     product. 

Will your generous
financial support help us distribute the Single worldwide so others can
participate financially and support our campaign to complete the Mother Of
Exiles Album and move on to Stage II?
Ariella Records is among one of the fastest
growing companies with offices in Canada, California, Zurich, and Switzerland.
 Distribution, Marketing and Artist development is just some of the services
this Artist- friendly company owed by Jason and Mandi Lafauci have helped
scores of new artist get their music heard around the world.   Without
your generous donations we would not have the funds to pay for the
above-mentioned necessities to complete our first stage and produce a stunning
professional, great sounding Album, as we market our new Single ""Mother
Of Exiles.""  You can hear our new Single at:  
https://www.reverbnation.com/q/6m0lb4

Your support will not only help us market the single
and complete the Album, your support is key to help us reach our initial
financial goal of $8,500.00, while we prepare ourselves for the second stage, which is the
production of the Mother Of Exiles music video.  Stage
two will be a separate campaign, but in advance, we would greatly appreciate
for those who may be in a position to provide generous contributions to help us
move that much close to hiring the production team needed to finalize the
script that will tell this story, and to complete the production of the music
video which will bring the Mother of Exiles to life for all to
participate and enjoy.  It is our story!!      

The Impact
I've worked in recording studios on projects
in the past.  On those occasions, the project was always defined by the
budget, which is almost always costly.  Now, I've been given this
incredibly, spiritual enriched opportunity to share, and continue advocating
for those who can not advocate for themselves through music; but I cannot ask
the musicians and engineers involved to commit their reputations and careers
without making it the best it can be.  And that costs big bucks! 
The project will also give musicians,
songwriters, singers, producers, scriptwriters; video/film production
companies; known artist; celebrities; corporations, TV and Radio Hosts, Fans, and
generous donors the opportunity to get involved and help us reach our goals and bring the issue of Immigration to the forefront.
  Additionally, with your support we can continue to grow our worldwide
Fan Base, which is key to our success.   One of the goals of this
campaign is to reach like-minded people for collaboration, raise money in
exchange for early access; rewards, and Perks you can used daily or exhibit proudly for participating in this musical movement.  We also want to spread the word
through your participation on a global scale because the issue of ""Immigration"" is important and global.  The more people we can get involved in this
campaign to support us by purchasing our “Mother Of Exiles"" Single, which will help us raise the capital for the second part of our musical journey (the production of our Mother Of Exiles music video), your support to complete the Album will enhance our chances of succeeding in reaching
people everywhere, and anywhere around the world so they can also
participate in this social and musical movement, and financially help us reach
our goals. 
Our campaign will give you the basics on our
efforts through videos and electronic correspondence showing or indicating the
different stages of the project’s progression.  Beyond that we encourage
you to ask us questions, donate and get involved.  We developed the
""Mother of Exiles"" to have the benefit of talking about this
important issue of immigration through music, so get involved, let us tell your
story, and enjoy making history!  We believe we are really onto an easier
way to face political and social issues with the grace and ease of music. 
THIS IS HAPPENING!!!  With the help of Ariella Records, we envision the
distribution and sells of our Single ""Mother Of Exiles” to being in June 2016. The
distribution and sales of our Single coupled with your generous donations will
provide us with the financial support we need to continue working on the
Album's completion.   We will begin recording the rest of the Album, as
well as mixing and mastering starting on or about end of June 2016 through
November 2016 with musicians from Arlington, VA, Maryland, Florida, California, and Puerto
Rico.  Here again, your generous financial support will allow us to bring
these A list musicians to our Studio in VA, or travel to the needed locations
to meet up with our A list musicians and guest artist that are not residents of
Maryland.    As stated, we plan to expand the scoring of our recorded
songs, expand the musical scoring for the music video Mother Of Exiles, with
several fantastic arrangers, some of which are donating their time.  But
writing out all the charts, as well as hiring top session players, securing a
top studio and engineer, and
all the mixing and mastering for a project of this quality is an extremely
expensive undertaking.  Still, it's one that I believe so many will be
touched by the message of the song, for which I cordially ask for your support,
participation and donations.  
Join Us and help us bring Mother of Exiles to a reality:
1) We ask you to support us by buying our
Single to keep the message alive and the project moving forward, 2) Have you
ever thought about using music to express yourself, 3) Do you want to be part
of a music revolution that is bigger than anything you have ever been part of,
4) Are you interested in facing issues that have stood the test of time through
beautiful music, 5) Are you a professional musician, singer, videographer,
scriptwriter, music producer, film/video producer, corporation, celebrity
or TV/Radio Host who believes in getting involved in social issues, 6) Is music
the voice you love to express and share with individuals like myself on
important issues such as immigration.  If so, we ask you to become part of
our Core Support Team, get involved, buy our Single and/or donate and participate and support
us.  Your donations will be greatly appreciated and used to complete this
first stage of this project.  If you could afford a little bit more, my
dream of making the Mother Of Exiles music video a reality becomes a
bit more closer and again for that I sincerely appreciate your involvement.

I picked up quite a few instruments myself as well!   What We Need & What You Get My goal is to allocate $500 towards mixing fees to cover the last round of mix revisions, $500 towards mastering, and $1000 for promotion (radio campaign, facebook ads, blog outreach, paid services)

</h3>Stack Rapids is a Hip Hop mixtape we've been curating for the past year. It consists of an hour and 20 minutes (20 tracks) jam packed with some of the best Hip Hoppers our city of Grand Rapids has to offer. It's versatile, diverse, and most importantly REALLY fricking good! We plan to release the project on June 16th, #LoveGR Day for FREE download off various media outlets, but with all this worked compiled, all the collaborations, and the #WeAreGR message circling the project, that just doesn't seem like a big enough splash..<br/><br/>With your contribution we are looking to raise $3,500 to purchase 5,000 physical CD's. With those CD's, we will flood the Grand Rapids metropolitan area, shinning light and deserved recognition for all 30+ Rapidians on the project. Each artist will get 50 CD's of their own to share with their individually unique fan base, give away free at shows, or anyway they can think to capitalize on the opportunity. We will also collaborate with local businesses by setting up ""pick up"" locations for the free CD's. These locations will not only serve as outlets for distributing this project, but will also drive more potential customers into the local business markets, helping create and push this #LocalSupportsLocal movement.  <br/><br/><h3><i>Stack Rapids (The Mixtape)</i></h3> 1.

<h3>My story </h3>
<p>It all has started when I was 3 years old and my mum placed me on the kitchen table to perform for our family guests. Since then, I was coming back on that table, singing some made up songs and loving all the attention I would receive :D </p>
<p>Eventually, I was too big for the table and my mum decided to get music lessons for me. I started piano and guitar lessons when I was 8, and I bought my first keyboard from the 1st communion's money! Since then, I would escape into my room,practising the songs I would learn at piano lessons plus making up my own melodies. I remember my older brother Michael, coming in at night to my room and playing on that keyboard together, trying to reconstruct the songs heard on the radio, while parents were asleep, unable to tell us off for staying up that late.  When I was 6, I've joined the band ""Promyczki"" associated with church, and for the next 10 years I would travel and  perform with them in hundreds of places around Europe (that was amaaaazing time!!!) When I was 15, I was too big (again) for the band, but grown up enough to join Music school in Vocal Class. I then believed I will become an Opera diva, and so did my mum.</p>

<br/><p>Unfortunately, my mum's dream didn't come true, her daughter decided to be rebel and play her own music. When I was 19, I came to London, loving the idea of a big world with plenty of possibilities and potential. But it wasn't that easy! What a surprise! I didn't know where and how to start, I would create more songs but keep them to myself, not knowing how to promote myself, who to tell, who to ask.

<p>""<strong>THE OPPORTUNITY OF A LIFETIME LAST IN THE LIFETIME OF THE
OPPORTUNITY""</strong></p>
<p>Dear reader,</p>
<p>I wanted to take a few moments to share my heart with you and give you the
opportunity to get to know more about me and the journey's God has taken me on.
I have been an ""aspiring"" artist since I was 16 years old. I started
playing guitar at about 10 years old. I've always been fascinated with the
ability music has to speak in a ""different language"" to people and
influence our everyday lives...whether positively or negatively. No matter
what I was going through I could always pick up my guitar or an instrument and
just lay everything on the table for hours. I have  performed music on stage
to larger audiences for years and have toured a little bit as well and it has been
amazing, humbling and even frustrating at times- basically more of a growing
experience first and for that I am thankful because we learn by more in our mistakes or in trial in
the industry more than we do our successes. I gave my life to Jesus 5 years ago 
in 2010  during college as God called me to greater things and my perspective on music
changed( or rather expanded). </p>
<p>Allow me to fast forward. About 2 years ago  November 11, 2013 I
traveled to Nashville, TN with my girlfriend and current wife Brittany. A
Christian talent/booking agency had discovered some of my songs on a social
media site and they asked me if I would be interested in performing in front of
a panel of judges that included publicists, established producers, and record
label A&amp;R's. The goal was through them to be signed by a major label by
some of my favorite artists and worship leaders around the world. It was a huge
blessing and I was very humbled. One of the judges, named Nathan Walters.
Nathan Walters is a former member of the Christian pop band Plus One that sold
1/2 a million records.  Long story short I wasn't ready to be signed
because  I hadn't been properly developed by my previous independent
record label. </p>
<p>Nathan and I have kept in contact and he agreed to produce and help me get
in the studio with some of the best musicians in the industry. Nathan is also
connected to radio promoters and label executives who help keep artist songs
current to the music industry standards. </p>
<p>Furthermore, a lot of time has gone by and I have been in prayer about this
for some time because I want to do God’s will in everything I set my heart to
do. I really wanted to prioritize my life and really go after the things God
has had me dreaming about and my BIGGEST goal was marrying my best friend
Brittany. I told Nathan before I jumped back in to the big sea of the music
industry I wanted to be married and have a nice place to live and settle in for
a bit. Brittany has always been supportive of my purpose in Christ but she has
also helped me to be patient and slow down a bit because everything works best
in His time. The Bible states to “let God transform you into a new person by
changing the way you think. THEN you will learn to know God’s will for you
which is good, pleasing and perfect.” I am so blessed by you reading this and
supporting my journey. My goal is to raise $6500 which will cover the recording
process, travel(for Brittany and I a few trips), hotel stay and radio
promotion. I pray and believe that God will use you to sow a seed and invest in
this dream God has put in me!</p>

<p>Hello, The
Indigos here. We are a loud 8-piece funky rock band from Muncie, IN. By
performing and singing about the importance of being yourself and following
your passions, we are doing what we love and strive to encourage others do the same through.
Right now we are working to become a professionally touring act within the
next 1-3 years. </p>
<p>To make this
happen, we are planning to do something crazy from July 16<sup>th</sup> – July
27<sup>th</sup>. We are heading out to the <b>Viper Room in Los Angeles, CA on July 21st</b>  and
stopping for a few shows there and back including Las Vegas, NV, Beaumont, TX,
Denver, CO, and Kansas City, MO just to name a few.</p>
<p>Not only are
we fortunate enough to perform in LA with our friend and veteran of the road
Rich Hardesty, but we also have the privilege of having some industry
professionals coming out to see us. This is shaping up to be the break we need
to make it to the next level – playing music professionally. Your support will
go a long way to helping us make our dream come true. We will use the first
$5,000 for gas, lodging and food for the band. The next $1,000 will help us
take a videographer and stage crew with us. Anything past $6,000 will be put toward
making the album for all of you even better. <br/></p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3></h3>
<p>We need $5,000 for road expenses: </p>
<p>This breaks down into $1,500 for gas for the van, $2,500 living expenses
for the band for the duration of the tour, and an additional $1,000 in lodging
expenses. Once we break $5,000, the next $1,200 will be used to take our
videographer, a small stage crew with us, and some financial padding for the
tour. Anything past that will go toward recording expenses for the album we are
recoding later this year. </p>
<p>For supporting us, we’ve got some great perks for you!</p>
</div> <div> <h3></h3>
<p>We are so thankful for all of your support and any contribution that you are
able to make. We have been
fortunate enough to do well in Indiana so far, and we look forward to exploring
new areas of music with you all. We’ve won Best Local Band of 2015, we’ve
played many of the best venues in the state with more on the way, and had a
blast every day with our fans – because when you’re around, we feel famous ;)
</p>
</div>
<p>Right now we're all recent college grads or undergrads almost finished with our degrees, and right now we've got the desire and work ethic to pull off being a professionally touring act. We need your help now to help catalyze our progress.<br/></p>
<div> <h3></h3>
</div>
<p>We realize some of you are in our boat as well. Money can be an issue in
everyday life and we understand. All we ask is that you share this with as many
people as you can! Getting exposure helps us by getting word out there that we
are trying to make a difference in the music industry and the world. If you're a fan of what we are doing, go ahead and hit that SHARE button.</p><p>Thank you for your support.</p><p>We love you all - The Indigos</p><p></p></div>","Hello, The

 founder Specialties: Singing,video, acting, general stunts,songwriting,
 scriptwriting, poetry, monitor of youth video workshops,drawing,entrepreneurship, company founder. I also give back by
 supporting different causes. 
Short bioAfter doing back vocals for artists and being an artist invited in  jams nights of blues cats like Sonny Wolf, Jim Zeller, Carl Tremblay, Black Hats, etc. Hagiel previously known as Analoga K takes her place on the Blues/Roots scene. Some say she has a soulful voice that reflects her influences in gospel classic rock and blues. She would like also to try jazz in the future. She organizes events from time to time. She was one of the organizers of a fundraiser for Haïti in the past. My campaign and why it's important to me.

My campaign is important to me because my followers are awaiting more  songs and it has been a while and I want to do this the right way with the dream team in a professional studio with a well-known Canadian Producer. 
 The magnitude of what contributors will help you achieve. 


By helping me out you will be able to say you contributed to my first blues, gospel, jazz album and that these songs will travel in my followers audio systems or mp3 players from all over the world. 
     What We Need & What You Get
The 3500$ will go to recording part of the album then we would apply for funding with this song that will be high-quality then do more songs. I will apply also to another organization for a loan. 
 My unique perks. Are you excited?

The Impact I will also get more exposure by performing and selling my own original songs. Will be able to submit to Festivals, events all across Canada and the States. I have got great reviews for my demos that I did in a friend`s home studio and I would like to push these further with a producer and also record new material in blues, gospel & jazz. The songwriting was done by myself and getting the feedback of a producer who has many contacts can get your music out there and heard. Enough of a Woman and Survivors got great reviews. Enough of a Woman is definitely a favorite.     Risks & Challenges
Its a challenge to combine many 
kinds of music and do them well and inspire at the same time the next 
generation! I am ready for this new challenge and to use my creative 
ideas and those of my team of professionals to succeed in achieving this
 challenge.

<h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>Since 1998 the National Marian Anderson Historical Society has been an organization that has been dedicated to promoting the late classical singer, who was considered of the most important opera performers of the 20th century, showcasing her Residence as a Museum and supporting the development and performance of Young Classical and Performing Artist Scholars. The organization was founded by Blanche Burton-Lyles and has existed for the past 15 years. The society itself consists of The Marian Anderson Residence Museum at 762 S. Martin St., where Anderson lived for much of her life.  Beyond that, the area around these sites has been named the Marian Anderson Village, which proudly boasts flags around the neighborhood. In addition to the residence houses, the village contains Marian Anderson’s church, elementary school and a recreational center dedicated to her. The society is working on creating the Marian Anderson Educational Pavilion, which it says is “designed to educate and produce and audio/visual interactive tour of the Marian Anderson Heritage Village.” Aside from merely promoting Anderson through displaying imagery from her life, the society seeks to spread Anderson’s music throughout the world. The scholars’ program frequently supports young classical and opera singers from around the world. These artists perform regularly at events that the society sponsors, and many have gone on to more prominent positions in places. As well as partnering with the Arts Empowerment Project to provide education, development and performance for all Children in the Arts in the Tri-State Area.</p>

<div>Now is the time for us to put our big boy pants on and make a mark on the world with our music.  Because of you, we have quickly taken over Memphis but we believe that there are even more of you out there that need our music for hope, for a smile, and sometimes the strength to get through the day.  </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>With that being said, we are making another record with the help of Lawrence 'Boo' Mitchell (John Mayer, Mark Ronson, Bruno Mars) at the legendary Royal Studios!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We’ve put together some awesome ideas, with the help of friends, to get this project off the ground. By doing this campaign through Indiegogo our goal is to include you as a part of something bigger than we could be on our own. We will work together to make something that will last forever and will always be a part of us.<br/>
</div> <p></p>There are a lot of different levels for contributing so you can find something you’re excited about! For $10 you get a digital download of the record with 2 exclusive acoustic versions of songs on the next record that NO ONE ELSE WILL GET unless they contribute...it's basically a pre-order.  The only difference is, instead of giving cash to iTunes you’re helping make the record right here and now, and you’ll be getting detailed updates along the way!  After that it can go anywhere from handwritten lyrics to one of our signed stage scrims. Those are just a few of the many perks!<br/><br/>This is our first record in a big studio and we're finally able to offer some of the awesome things we’ve always wanted to give to you.  This is our chance to make something permanent together and we couldn’t be more thankful to have such supportive fans that will be a part of this with us from start to finish. Whether you make a contribution, tell a friend, or share the campaign online, no matter what part you want to play in this effort, we love you for it.<br/><br/>Thanks so much for being a part of this journey with us.

<p>Since we are always trying to expand our boundaries on every level and always prefer to walk on paths that nobody has stepped on before, last summer we did something quite unusual, something that has never been done before. At least, not like this...</p>
<p><b>We have recorded an album on the top of a mountain.</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Why? </b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Our
Moldavian Csángó folk song compilation <b>Pille<i> </i></b>has
ripened and waited for many years, ready for the day when we will record it in
the nature. <span>It’s not a common
practice for a sound studio to move out under the open sky with its entire
equipment, but it only felt right for us to take the songs back where they were
born a long time ago… in the nature. It has always been very important to us to nurture our
traditions, and to bring to light all those values, which we have discovered.
The secrets lying in these folk songs should never be forgotten.</span></p>

Who We Are and What We Do We are a passionate team of Transylvanian filmmakers and musicians playing a mixture of different genres. In the past 29 years (as Role band) we've had 14 concept programs (including a concert for children based on the principles of composer Zoltán Kodály, several rock albums with our very own and original songs, and two compilations of poems set to music). We've also orchestrated 5 rock operas presenting and reviving scenes from Hungarian history.
Since we are always trying to expand our boundaries on every level and always prefer to walk on paths that nobody has stepped on before, last summer we did something quite unusual, something that has never been done before. At least, not like this...
We have recorded an album on the top of a mountain.

Why? 

Our
Moldavian Csángó folk song compilation Pille has
ripened and waited for many years, ready for the day when we will record it in
the nature. It’s not a common
practice for a sound studio to move out under the open sky with its entire
equipment, but it only felt right for us to take the songs back where they were
born a long time ago… in the nature. It has always been very important to us to nurture our
traditions, and to bring to light all those values, which we have discovered.
The secrets lying in these folk songs should never be forgotten.
Who are the Csángós?
If you'd like to find out more about the Csángó people (roughly translated as ""wanderers"") and their very specific music, click on the link below.






Link About Csángós 
While working with these treasures and adapting them, we carefully paid attention to the lyrics, the rhythm and the melodic line of the songs. However, we transmit them with the instruments of up-to-date sound technology and modern orchestration, all this in our very own way.



Pille (that is Feather) drifted by the
wind, human fate, lives, love, joy and sorrow, You and I, we all are a part of
these songs.And now you can help us show everyone how it has been done.We (= the video crew and the musicians) plan to release the video material made during the audio recordings on DVD as a unique making-of movie, with interviews and background info on our difficulties, struggles, accomplishments, personal experiences, and meanwhile each of the 20 songs will come to life through live footage and illustrations.  Video crew:
Zsuzsa Demeter (Demizsu) - video concept, director

Barna Nagy - camera operator, editor 

Dénes Sántha - production manager, camera operator, animationsPlease help this enthusiastic and devoted little team finish and release the Pille DVD!What We Need & What You Get
The funds raised from this campaign will pay for the DVD production and for finishing the final edit and packaging costs. 
To show our gratitude, we hope you will find something on this list you will appreciate from us and our most sincere thanks for being a part of this. Thank you... have so long worked to manifest this project and have created some really great perks that include original art work, hand painted t-shirts, signed CDs and, of course, a signed DVD that you helped fund, as well as other ""surprise"" items.















The funds
raised with your help will cover the cost of:

Recording, mixing, mastering,
     artwork, manufacturing and distributing the DVD Pille 
Basic PR & marketing and technical equipment, costs

The more
funds we manage to raise, the more money we will put into making this DVD
spectacular.
We
believe in these songs, this video and this project, and we will see it through!

Egy lelkes kis erdélyi csapat vagyunk, amely egy elkötelezett videós stábból és sokféle műfajt játszó erdélyi zenészekből áll. Az elmúlt 29 évben (Role zenekarként) 14 koncept műsort készítettünk (a kodályi elvekre épülő gyerekkoncerttől Ady Endre és József Attila verseinek dalba öntéséig). Mivel mindig próbáljuk feszegetni a határainkat és gyakran indulunk el olyan utakon, melyeken előttünk senki nem járt, ezért tavaly nyáron egy egészen különleges dolgot valósítottunk meg.
A legutóbbi albumunk hanganyagát egy hegy tetején vettük fel.
Miért?


A Pille című
moldvai csángó műsorunk sok évet érett és várt rá, hogy zenekarunk egy napon
kivigye a természetbe és felvétel készüljön róla. Nem mindennapi dolog, hogy egy profi
hangstúdió a teljes felszerelésével kiköltözik a szabad ég alá, de úgy éreztük
helyénvalónak, ha visszavisszük a dalokat oda, ahol egykoron
születhettek... a természetbe. Fontosnak tartjuk hagyományaink
ápolását és azt, hogy megmutassuk másoknak is azon értékeket, amelyeket
felfedezhettünk magunknak. Olyan titkok rejlenek ezekben a népdalokban,
amelyeket nem lenne szabad elfeledni.
Az átdolgozásokban gondosan
ügyeltünk a népdalok szöveg, ritmus és dallam világára, ugyanakkor a
korszerű hangtechnika, a modern hangszerelés és hangszerek eszközeivel, a
magunk módján közvetítjük őket.
Pille, amit sodor a szél,
emberi sorsok, életek, szerelmek, öröm és bánat, Te és mi, mindannyian

<p>Patchwork Project is a new initiative for the performance of American music. Our goal is to present innovative programs that reflect the unique American artistic fabric.</p>
<p>Through research, collaboration, and performance we will join together a wide variety of artists to create something new. Our program will evolve and change to honor the musical culture of each city we perform in. We aim to create something that will echo the voices of the vast American musical landscape, whether that be through the works of popular composers such as Aaron Copland and Leonard Bernstein or through exploring the works of lesser-known composers such as Hub Miller and Gabriel Kahane.</p>
<p>Our name is in homage to the process of making a patchwork quilt. Traditionally, scraps or pieces of worn textiles are sewn together to make a vibrant new fabric for use in a variety of ways. We aim to reflect this process in our creation and presentation of our concert programs.</p>
<p>We are raising money and building a network to support our first concert tour across the Midwest and Northeast this coming July and August! We'll be roadtripping between Chicago, IL and New York, NY with stops in various cities in Ohio, Illinois, upstate New York, Massachusetts, and more to come! In each city we will feature a rotating cast of guest artists-- both singers and instrumentalists-- who will collaborate with us to present each unique program. No two concerts will be the same! </p>
<br/> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We are not seeking to make a profit on this venture, rather just to create some awesome programs and cover our own travel and preparation expenses.

<p>If you live in one of the cities on our tour, you will get to experience a concert unlike anything you've ever experienced before!

<div>I own several instruments and recording equipment, so these funds will go into purchasing one or two pieces of gear to make recording easier (a new mic, and maybe a tracking compressor) but mostly the funds would allow me the free time to devote to this project.

<div>The perks will be simple for this project- for $10 you can get a digital copy of this album, with stranger's theme songs on it.</div>
<div>For $25 you will receive a physical copy- in CD, flash drive, or Cassette format (your choice!)</div>
<div>For $50 you will receive a personal theme song.</div>
<div>If I don't reach the $800 and you order a theme song, I will still be able to make your theme.

<div>This album is both a unique experience for the audience and for me, I'm very excited about getting to know people and create melodies around their personalities. It's a truly interesting experiment.</div>

MEET MELODY…



My name is Melody Lin, and I am a third year student studying for a Bachelor of Music degree in cello performance at the Royal College of Music. I specialise in chamber music and solo performance, and truly hope that I have a promising career ahead of me as an internationally performing musician! I have made a brilliant life for myself in London over the last few years, and adore the country and culture of the UK. 
UNI FEES...
As an International Student, the cost of my degree each year is a staggering £20,850, which is nearly three times the price offered to domestic students. This cost has been partly subsidised by the RCM via a merit-based Foundation Scholarship, whilst the remainder of my funds come from the generous support from my family and friends. This works out at the cost to study of around £3,000 per month.
In the previous two years of my study, a scholarship from RCM and a company sponsored my study in London and could therefore keep up with my tuition, as well as helping the enormous living costs faced by Londoners. 
DISASTER HAS STRUCK.
Since last year in September I have been struggling to cover my £3,000 monthly instalments for my tuition fees. I have managed to raise nearly £3,000 in a private fundraising concert and have another concert scheduled for the end of April.
As an international student on a Tier 4 Visa, I also have limited options to obtain income by working, as although I could be earning a fantastic income via teaching, my visa imposes a maximum limit of just 20 hours work per week. 
Suspending my studies would mean suspending my right to study in the UK, and the end of my career development plans at the Royal College of Music, including the cancellation of all of my upcoming concerts.
I have reached out to the RCM’s hardship fund, but was rejected because my professional income from teaching and playing in external concerts is insufficient to fulfil the remaining of my tuition fee due to my Visa restrictions.  
My only option remain that does not involve interrupting my studies is the transfer of my degree to another institution. Fortunately, I have managed to secure a fully funded Scholarship to the world-renowned Conservatorio della Svizzera Italiana in the Swiss town of Lugano, where I will be finishing off the fourth and the last year of my degree.
THE ISSUE IS THIS:

If I do not complete this year at the Royal College of Music, I will be unable to earn credits towards the completion of my degree.
I have already spent £14,000 on my degree studies in London this year, and if I do not complete the year, this will have been effectively wasted. I will have to redo all of this year in Lugano.
I cannot work to earn the money to pay for my outstanding fees, due to visa requirements.

SOLUTION:
This has left me with one option: to ask my friends and colleagues to help me to raise £4,000 to pay for the remaining fees for this year, so I can transfer my degree studies to Lugano at the end of the year.
It is of course a lot to ask, but by many people coming together and pledging a small amount of money, I know that we can raise enough funds to secure the final few months of my studies at the RCM! 
So please, give what you can. This is literally my last chance to save what remains of my degree in the UK before transferring to Switzerland. I appreciate any and all support that you can give me.

nouveau souffle de la musique africaine. Leur musique se trouve à la 
croisée des chemins entre le blues Malien, l’Afrobeat, le rock et le 
jazz qui font naître une sonorité kaléidoscopique. 
The word Sahad translates to harvest in Serer. Change the last syllable to a « t » sound, and Sahad becomes the Wolof term for « resurrection. » It’s also the first name of the lead singer of the musical ensemble known as Sahad and the Nataal Patchwork. 
Sahad and the Nataal Patchwork is a reflection of many diverse musical influences, a wandering spirit, a journey of awakening, a hyphen between cultures. This group is in effect a cultural crossroads where different musicians from all walks of life meet. Together they make their contribution to the rich traditions of young musicians who carry the torch of the new African music. Their music finds itself at the intersection of Malian blues, Afrobeat, rock and jazz all of which nourish this kaleidoscopic soundscape. 

Nous ne sommes pas dans une maison de disque et nous n'avons pas encore de label, c'est pour cela que nous faisons appel à vous. 
Nous avons eu la chance de remporter le Tanit d'Or aux Journées Musicales de Carthage en Tunisie, accompagné de 8 800 €. Cette somme nous a permis :
- de donner une petite participation aux musiciens du Patchwork (1 750 €);
- de couvrir la moitié des frais de la soirée sur Dakar organisée à l'effigie de cette récompense et pour lancer le crowdfunding (750€);
- de rembourser les frais d'un an de travail (production de l'EP, production du clip-vidéo, création du site internet, frais de communication, relation presse, matériel studio et technique, etc.) (6 500€).

We aren’t yet part of a record company or record label, that’s why we need your help.
We were lucky enough to take the Golden Prize at the Carthage Music Days festival in Tunisia, accompanied by an award of 8,800 euros. This sum will allow us to :
-  Compensate the musicians with 1750 euros
- Cover half the cost of the celebratory concert in Dakar and fund this crowdfunding
campaign (750 euros)
-Cover the cost of a year’s work including production of an EP, production of a music video, creating a website, publicity and press coverage, technical equipment, etc.
Nous sommes en train de réaliser les pré-productions avec un ingénieur son dans notre studio. Les maquettes seront bientôt prêtes ! Il nous reste encore tout un circuit à réaliser pour produire l'album et le défendre, afin qu'il sorte en Octobre 2016.
Et il faut savoir qu'un album de qualité, c'est beaucoup de frais ! 
Après l'enregistrement des morceaux : frais de studios, techniciens, musiciens, choristes, réalisateur artistique, etc. ils méritent tous une participation, vient l'étape du mixage de l'album, puis du mastering (étape finale sur l'audio), de la création de la pochette et des éléments graphiques, des clips, etc.

	Et une fois que les côtés artistiques du projet de terminés, il faut s'occuper de la promotion, pour faire connaître l'existence de l'album. Cela passe par une équipe de communication et des attachés de presse.
On vous passe d'autres frais annexes (droits d'auteur, impressions de visuels, transports, nourriture, contreparties, etc.)
Les frais de l'album s'élèvent à 15 000 €, nous faisons appel à vous pour avoir les deux tiers de cette somme, soit 10 000 € ($11 500).
Voici la répartition de notre budget :
- Ingénieur son + séances studio live = 2 000 €
- Réalisateur album = 1 500 €
- Mix + mastering = 2 000 €
- Pressage albums (1000 CD) + vinyls (120 vinyls) = 1 600 €
- Musiciens = 3 000 € (15 musiciens)
- Budget communication = 2 000 €
- Réalisation d'un clip = 1 500 €
- Frais annexes = 1 000 €

We’re already working on the preproduction process with an engineer in our studio. The demos are already finished. All that remains is a path to production and promotion of the album as soon as it is released in October 2016.
As you may already know, producing a quality album comes with a high price tag.
Costs associated with recording and production of the album inclue : studio fees, technicians, musicians, back-up singers, the artisitc director, etc. After recording is taken care of, mixing and mastering remain as well as design of album art &amp; cover, music videos, etc.
Once the creative phase of the process is finished, the promotion process must begin in order
to make known the existance of the album.
Other auxilliary costs include copyrighting fees, printing fees, transportation, meals, etc.
The total cost of the album will be 15,000 euros. We’re asking you to help cover two thirds of that cost, 10,000 euros ($11,500).
Here’s how our budget breaks down :
- Sound engineer and live studio recording sessions = 2000 euros
- Album producer = 1500 euros
- Mix + mastering = 2 000 €
- Production of 1000 CD’s and album jackets + 120 vinyl copies = 1600 euros
- Compensations for 15 musicians = 3000 euros
- Communication budget = 2000 euros
- Production of 1 music video = 1500 euros
- Additional fees = 1000 euros
On compte sur vous !Merci - Thank You - Jere Jef !

Or if you want to be a major contributor to Strive and Matt's next album you have the option of spending $1,000 to become a PRODUCER! If we don't reach our goal of $5,000 then we will still use the money we gather to by Merchandise and help us market the tour so more people can participate.    The Impact Many people think that their contribution doesn't impact us, WRONG:  You're help will influence a younger generation of Self Motivated artist feel empowered and willing to achieve their dreams. Matt has already had years of live performance experience and has been doing test runs all over Washington State which has already been benificial. You have an opportunity right now to make a huge difference in people lives, from audience members to entrepreneurs.    Risks & Challenges  This tour does come with many risks. I could easily become sick and have to cancel some shows due to that, or I may run out of guitar strings if I try and do this tour self funded.  However I already have experience working 18+ hours in a Seafood Processing Plant in Alaska, so being tired is not a challenge to me.
I already play two to three open mic nights a week so I have trained my body to be ready for this endeavor. For the first two weeks I will be on my own. However after Silas finishes school he will join me for the more difficult part of the journey stretching down from Oregon to California. With his help, this tour will be successful, no doubt in my mind.    Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:  Share this campaign and my music with all of your friends and family members. Ask them to share it if they like it. By showing more people you can have an even greater impact then just contributing financially  Please use Indiegogo's share tools so that people you will be showing can come directly to this page!

  Monteverdi's 1610 Vespers stood as the grandest piece of religious music for more than a century after its composition, and many musicians today consider it some of the best music ever composed. Calling for rarely heard, exquisite historical instruments and early music singers, this masterpiece expresses a great variety of sounds and emotions. This piece has never been performed in Detroit due to the expertise needed for a historically inspired performance. Audivi, a professional vocal ensemble, and Dark Horse Consort, a nationally renowned instrumental ensemble, will join to perform the Monteverdi Vespers at the grand, resonant Cathedral of the Most Blessed Sacrament on Sunday, April 24, at 3:00 p.m.

<h3>About Mephisto</h3>
<p>There is nothing we enjoy more than those performances during which it feels as though the audience is in the palm of our hand. We have their undivided and complete attention: the perfect atmosphere for communicating our ideas. Sometimes it is the characterful and theatrical aspect of our interpretation that captures the audience's imagination. The movement, the drama, the intensity. But on other occasions it's the sheer virtuosity that grabs our listeners, with almost mysterious effect.</p>
<p>Legend has it that the bourgeoisie regularly fainted at concerts given by the great Niccolò Paganini. The aura of mystique enshrouding his personality and talent was truly remarkable, to the point where the only possible explanation for such great artistry had to be something super-human. No wonder so many believed he had sold his soul to the devil, a legend which persisted even after his death, denying him a proper burial in sacred ground. He was a genuine interpreter, perhaps one of the first for whom <i>what</i> he played did not matter as much as <i>how </i>he played it. It seems very possible that the young Franz Liszt wanted to exude a similar air of mystique when he started writing and performing his own virtuoso piano music, often borrowing themes from other composers and transforming them into fantastic virtuosic showpieces in the great Paganini tradition.</p>
<p>We couldn't resist this idea ourselves when we decided to weave our next album around this red thread – this mephistophelian virtuosity.</p>

I have decided to put up a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo to seek for your monetary support.I have set up a campaign goal of $1000 for my initial goal funding. In any case that this campaign has exceeded its initial campaign goal before or after this campaign is over, this campaign page will become an InDemand page and will no longer show days or hours left, no fundraising target and no deadline limits.InDemand makes it easy for any successful campaigner to keep raising funds after their campaign ends. With InDemand, I can accept contributions even after my campaign ends, grow my community and reach new audiences, and  I will get ongoing exposure on the Indiegogo platform for as long as I like.  BiographyEirene Iana Mascariña Enriquez (born on 16 July 1994), better known as Iana, is a singer-songwriter based in Singapore. She is of Filipino, Spanish and Chinese descent and was born in San Pedro, Laguna, Philippines and was raised by her grandparents in an island province—Alabat, Quezon while her parents are working abroad to provide for the family.Iana discovered her talent when she first performed for her grandfather’s election campaign show when she was just 7 years old, the crowd and their overwhelming response was her motivation in going into the arts scene.In 2005, Iana and her family moved to Singapore. At 11 years old, she auditioned and became a member of the Singapore Symphony Children’s Choir, a classical chorale training ground with the Singapore Symphony Orchestra. At the age of 14, she was discovered by her then manager, Kuo Po, the creative director of Singapore’s premier performing arts school—Kids Performing™ where she was trained in singing, acting, dancing whilst performing for multitude of events for four years. Her musical debut started when she was offered a lead role in NARNIA, the Musical (the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe).Since then, Iana has been involved in various events, musicals and concerts such as the Straits Times’ annual charity concert ChildAid, Youth Olympic Games, Singapore Airshow, ASEAN School Games to name a few.Iana was a secondary student of St. Anthony’s Canossian Secondary School and later on took the ALS (Alternative Learning System) to finish her secondary studies. After Secondary, she took a Diploma in Music Production in City College - SODE (School of Design and Entrepreneurship) for a year. Recently, she has been accepted into LASALLE College of the Arts and will start freshman year this August. Influences: Adele, Amy Winehouse, Christina Aguilera, Sia, Jessie J and Kelly Clarkson. My goal is to pre-sell enough digital download of ""Killer"" and fabulous loot to fund this recording project.I am working to raise at least $20,000 to cover the costs involved in recording, releasing and promoting a professional, full-length, studio album. Here's where the money is going:

Pre-production: this is where the songs and arrangements are worked out, overturned, ripped apart, thrown out, re-born, and put back together with a lot of time, sweat, energy, and talent.  

Studio Recording: this is where all the musicians and I, sound engineers, and their assistants come together to record the songs as you'll hear them on the finished album.  For me, this involves several days booked at the great Analog Factory in Singapore, with a stellar producer/engineer and his respective crew.  It also involves hiring top-gun studio musicians to help fill in the musical spaces with instrumentation that I personally don't play.

Mastering: this is a mysterious and magical part of the process. I don't exactly know what mastering engineers are doing in there, but mastering is what puts the shimmer and shine on to the finished mix.  It's an essential part of the finished song. 

CD & Album Manufacturing and Production: when the whole recording process it finished, this is the step that gets the actual CD or Vinyl into your hands. There are costs involved not only in the production of these physical beauties but also in the artwork, design & of course, shipping costs.

</p><p>Hi, my name is <b>Dave Cipriani,</b> and I’m asking for your help to finish my most ambitious musical album yet, “My Heart is Pierced” - the new album by the world music group <b>Mahadev</b>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This album represents the next step in my evolution of combining music styles in a way that is organic and soulful.  It has a wide mix - many groove based compositions that are relatively simple to more complex pieces with tricky rhythms and breaks.

<p>
</p><p>I studied jazz with the great <b>Charlie Byrd</b> and attended masterclass with <b>Christopher Parkening </b>several years ago.  later, I studied in India on 20-string Indian Slide Guitar with <b>Pandit Barun Kumar Pal,</b> and more recently I greatly deepened my studies at <b>California Institute of the Arts</b>, with <b>Pandit Swapan Chaudhuri </b>and<b> Randy Gloss</b>, and most importantly with<b> Ustad Aashish Khan</b>, with whom I still study with when I can.  I also studied at CalArts with the great Balkan/Flamenco guitarist <b>Miroslav Tadic, </b>and<b> with Stuart Fox, Vinnie Golia, David Roitstein, Larry Koonse </b>and<b> Milen Kirov.</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>I would say that this album, to date is the best summation of everything I have studied, and everyone I studied with over these many years. To further that, I have assembled the best group of musicians I’ve gotten together.  In addition to the regular group of 5 guys, I got several excellent musicians to lend their talents to this.  </p><blockquote>The album features:<br/><b>Mahadev (regular group):<br/></b>Dave Cipriani - 7-string classical guitar, Indian Slide Guitar &amp; vocals<br/>Mike Mull: saxophones, clarinets<br/>Dave Tranchina: Upright Bass<br/>Chris Payne: Cajon, Congas, Drumkit, Shakers, Jank, Vibes<br/>Jamie Papish: Riq, Daf, Triangle, Shakers, Quarkabeb (Moroccan Cymbals)<br/><b>The extra awesome musicians:<br/></b>Tahir Faridi Qawwal - Qawwali vocal solo on “Burning Sword of Wisdom”<br/>Greg Zilborg: Trumpet<br/>Leonice Shinneman: Tabla, Calabash<br/>Indradeep Ghosh: - indian Violin<br/>Dr. Neelamjit Dhillon - Tabla, Alto Saxophone<br/>Robin Sukhadia - Tabla<br/>Chris Votek - Cello<br/>Clinton Patterson - Trumpet<br/>Vikram Devasthali- Trombone<br/><b>And I have to mention these people even if it is a 2nd time:<br/></b>Chris Votek - recording &amp; editing, string arranging<br/>Clinton Patterson - overdub recording, Producing &amp; general productive argumenting, mixing<br/>Andrew Mudrock - session recording at Hobby Shop and feet-to-the-fire-holding </blockquote><p><b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">What We Need</b><br/></p>

Hi, my name is Dave Cipriani, and I’m asking for your help to finish my most ambitious musical album yet, “My Heart is Pierced” - the new album by the world music group Mahadev.

What You Get

For some of the different levels of perks, you get to dig into mine and other members’ back catalogs, a treasury of music from some awesome musicians, plus some fun one’s like breakfast and live music for you!.

If we don’t reach the entire goal, the funds will be prioritized:

mix & finish the album!

The Impact

This is music that is simultaneously complex and reaches for the heart.  Musicians will dig hearing it, as well general listeners will get excited or touched by it.  This is the best work I’ve ever done, everyone that I have played it for agrees, close loved ones and friends as well as people new to my music.

This music is ambitious yet accessible.  Many beautiful moments, lots of grooves with heart and emotion.

Risks & Challenges

The big risk is that the music falls outside of the norms, that it is too ambitious.  I think I have proven through various projects that I can make some great music, and I have gotten the best musicians and been the most slow moving on this album to make sure everything is as good as possible - work for the album first started in 2014, with several recording sessions that year, and a few last year.  Some of that has been because me and my amazing partner Emily had a baby boy in the fall of 2014 which has meant doing this project in its own time.

<p>Hi yall, I'm Glitter Rose.  I've been blessed with the opportunity and the will to live my dreams as a songwriter and musician.  Sometimes, those dreams are a different reality than I envisioned, but I haven't had to follow anyone's rules but my own. I have the freedom and support to make music the way I envision it. In 17 years of doing so, I've loved, lost, learned, lived and most of all, overcome any obstacle that has presented itself, no matter how heartbroken, or soul-broken I may have been.</p>
<p>What I haven't done is let anyone in.  I haven't creatively exposed myself. For a long, long time, I kept my emotions at bay by writing music about other people, telling their stories, or making up characters all together.  I wanted people to have fun, I wanted people to feel good.  So I decided I didn't want to burden my fans with my feelings and struggles. </p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">What I've come to realize is that its ok to write about things that make me sad, or feel vulnerable.  Its ok to tell yall I'm in love, or that I'm confused.  Mainly, because you all feel these things too. I've noticed as I dig deep into my darkest crevices, and bring it to the surface, I'm healing and helping others.  Helping them understand and mend their wounds because now they see, I feel it too and through it all, I stay strong, hopeful, and know the most important thing in life is love whether it's family, friends or lovers, present or lost.  It always comes back around, in one way or another.</span><br/></p>
<p>""Outlaw In Love"" is my 3rd full length album as a solo artist, and it is my most honest, true, painful and inspiring collection of songs to date.  I experienced many kinds of love and heartbreak in the past 4 years.  Of course, the only way for an outlaw to love is with no rules, and it has resulted in some of the greatest and lowest moments of my life, but most of all, some of the best songs I've ever written.</p>
<p>Join me in my journey and experience the story of the girl I was, and the woman I'm becoming.  Meet an Outlaw In Love.</p> </div> <div> <h3>The logistics...</h3> <p>The fact is, it takes money to make an album.  There are ways to make it less expensive, but there are also corners that cannot be cut. Hard work and people who believe in what I do is how I've sustained in this business for 17 years.  I've been very blessed to have beautifully talented, good people on my team over the years.  </p>
<p> This album is no different. My team is epic. I have an amazing band, an incredible engineer and recording partner, the best companies and individuals in the business supporting the project and undying support from my family, my friends and my fans.  We are going to make a professional, radio ready album that is going to inspire, evoke emotion and introduce people to a new GR and a new style of Southern Rock.  This will also be my first entirely self produced album. </p>
<p>Here's a breakdown what we intend to do with the funds earned:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>$2,000 - Studio Time</li>
<li>$2,000 - Engineer and Mixing</li>
<li>$1,500 - Mastering</li>
<li>$1,000 - Band and Additional Musicians</li>
<li>$2,000 - Reproduction of CD's, Artwork, and Distribution Fees</li>
<li>$1,500 - Processing Fees to Indiegogo (approx.)</li>
<li>$3,000 - Marketing/Promotion</li>
<li>$2,000 - Perks costs and shipping &amp; handling</li>
</ul>
<div>In return, we are offering some sweet perks, like:</div>
<div><ul>
<li>Signed CD's and GR Swag packs</li>
<li>Exclusive VINYL packages</li>
<li>Private whiskey party with GR and the band</li>
<li>Be part of the studio audience for our Live Acoustic EP recording and Q&amp;A</li>
<li>Be featured in a GR music video</li>
<li>Executive Producer credits and a day in the studio</li>
<li>...and more</li>
</ul></div> </div> <div> <h3>The impact...</h3> <p></p>
<p>By lending your support in making this record, you will be an integral part of the advancement of my career.  I'm at a level in my field that I will be able to get this album into the hands of people that can take it further and help it grow.  This album will also be submitted for GRAMMY consideration.</p>
<p>I am releasing this album as I have all of my others, completely independent.  Every sale, every stream, every blog or article, will all come down to me and my team making it happen.  I am not afraid of hard work, and that helps you know that what you contribute is being appreciated and put to good use. </p> </div> <div> <h3>The challenge...</h3> <p>What if we don't reach our goal?  We will still make this album.  Its happening no matter what.  The difference in meeting our goal or not, is the impact the record will have and how far it can go.  It doesn't do us much good to record an album, and then have no funds to reproduce it or distribute it.  No one can benefit from the gift of music if they can't hear it.  Meeting our goal is crucial to the support of this album.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The ways you can help...</h3> <p>I understand more than anyone the struggles of today's economy, and that financially, times are tough.  My 3 years in LA have been rough and at one point, I was homeless.  I've also had several other creator friends run campaigns and even when I was sleeping in my truck on the beach, I donated the last $5 I had left in my account to help.   That's because I believe in artists and I believe in karma.  I couldn't do what I do without your support, and I want to lend that same support to the art I love and respect, and so on.  </p>
<p>If you can't donate any money, that's ok.  You can help by following this campaign and commenting on it here at Indiegogo.  You can also share this campaign on your Facebook wall, or blog about it, or tweet it.  Maybe send an email to your music loving friends and ask if they can spread the word too.  </p>
<p>Ultimately, its really not about money.  It's about spreading the word, and gaining new believers.  Its about music, love, hope and inspiration.  Money can't buy any of that.  What money does is help it manifest into a product that can be enjoyed by the masses.  If you aid in me gaining a new fan, you've contributed to this project.  </p>
<p><b>Anything, and everything, helps.</b></p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to learn about my project and listen to my story.  I can't wait for you all to see the benefits of believing in and support this album.  Until then... this outlaw is sending her love. Rock on! GR</p>
</div></div>","The true story... 
Hi yall, I'm Glitter Rose.  I've been blessed with the opportunity and the will to live my dreams as a songwriter and musician.  Sometimes, those dreams are a different reality than I envisioned, but I haven't had to follow anyone's rules but my own. I have the freedom and support to make music the way I envision it. In 17 years of doing so, I've loved, lost, learned, lived and most of all, overcome any obstacle that has presented itself, no matter how heartbroken, or soul-broken I may have been.
What I haven't done is let anyone in.  I haven't creatively exposed myself. For a long, long time, I kept my emotions at bay by writing music about other people, telling their stories, or making up characters all together.  I wanted people to have fun, I wanted people to feel good.  So I decided I didn't want to burden my fans with my feelings and struggles. 
What I've come to realize is that its ok to write about things that make me sad, or feel vulnerable.  Its ok to tell yall I'm in love, or that I'm confused.  Mainly, because you all feel these things too. I've noticed as I dig deep into my darkest crevices, and bring it to the surface, I'm healing and helping others.  Helping them understand and mend their wounds because now they see, I feel it too and through it all, I stay strong, hopeful, and know the most important thing in life is love whether it's family, friends or lovers, present or lost.  It always comes back around, in one way or another.
""Outlaw In Love"" is my 3rd full length album as a solo artist, and it is my most honest, true, painful and inspiring collection of songs to date.  I experienced many kinds of love and heartbreak in the past 4 years.  Of course, the only way for an outlaw to love is with no rules, and it has resulted in some of the greatest and lowest moments of my life, but most of all, some of the best songs I've ever written.
Join me in my journey and experience the story of the girl I was, and the woman I'm becoming.  Meet an Outlaw In Love.   The logistics... The fact is, it takes money to make an album.  There are ways to make it less expensive, but there are also corners that cannot be cut. Hard work and people who believe in what I do is how I've sustained in this business for 17 years.  I've been very blessed to have beautifully talented, good people on my team over the years.  
 This album is no different. My team is epic. I have an amazing band, an incredible engineer and recording partner, the best companies and individuals in the business supporting the project and undying support from my family, my friends and my fans.  We are going to make a professional, radio ready album that is going to inspire, evoke emotion and introduce people to a new GR and a new style of Southern Rock.  This will also be my first entirely self produced album.

<p>Just think to yourself for a second. Think of how your
donation will impact a child’s life. The donation you make, no matter how big
or small will help to provide a child that is scared for their life each day
with an escape from reality. The music that they play and create is more than
just a song to them. It will be a feeling of safety, security and reassurance
that everything will be alright in the end. Music has the power to do that to
someone. The children will stop feeling worried and smile again, you will be

</div></div>","Hello there! Thank you for taking your time to click on this campaign. My name is Mackenzie Yorke and I am a 14 year old girl who likes to make people happy and put smiles on their faces. I believe that us as humans need to work together and keep the world peaceful and at ease. What better way to do that then to make someone else smile? :) You see, I have noticed that collectively, us humans are not holding up their end of the bargain and there is  more aggression and anger in some parts of the world then peace and love. Specifically, I am talking about the war going on in Afghanistan.As a child myself, I couldn't imagine what fear and sorrow the kids living in Afghanistan must face each day. After awhile, these kids must get quite sad and just want to smile, have fun, and just be kids again! I plan to help them smile by giving them the gift of music, a recorder!Anytime I am sad, I like to listen to music or make my own and I want children who are faced with fear and worry and sadness to just get a chance to let it all out through the music they'll create with their new recorders. I think music in itself is healing. It is an expression of humanity; something we are all touched by regardless of race or religion that will always put a smile on someones face.     Where will the $$$ Go?
All of the money raised from this campaign will go towards
the purchasing of: 

Recorders
Recorder cleaning tools 
Books that teach children how to play the
recorder and basic knowledge about music
Sheet music for various songs to learn and play.


I strive to raise enough money to purchase 50 recorders for
the children in the town of Samangan, along with 50 sets of recorder cleaning
tools, 50 books to teach the children how to play the recorder and 100 sets of
sheet music. If I do not reach my $500 goal for this campaign, I will buy as
many recorders, books, cleaning tools and sheet music as I can with the money
that was donated and then donate the remaining money to various charities in Afghanistan.

    The Impact 

Just think to yourself for a second. Think of how your
donation will impact a child’s life. The donation you make, no matter how big
or small will help to provide a child that is scared for their life each day
with an escape from reality. The music that they play and create is more than
just a song to them. It will be a feeling of safety, security and reassurance
that everything will be alright in the end. Music has the power to do that to
someone. The children will stop feeling worried and smile again, you will be
helping to make people happy!

</p><p>Last year our festival was a major success and it was because of the help from our worldwide community that we were able to have a powerful day of awareness. Making a music festival is really challenging especially coming from a family of musicians and management. We usually get invited to perform at festivals and the background work is done way in advance. Seeing the work that needs to be done and having the young people as a point of inspiration is what keeps us going because there are many moments when you want to give up. I will speak for our team and say that giving up isn't an option when you have talent that is overlooked and unappreciated in these young moguls in the making. </p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">To put it simply, ""WE NEED YOUR HELP""! </span><br/></p><p>

With a  pledge of $100 and above you, as an Associate of the Community Unity Music Festival,  will receive (1) complimentary ticket to sit in the reserved VIP section of the festival. 



$50 - Giver of Hope 

With a generous pledge of $50 and above you will be given a commemorative ink pen as a token of appreciation from our festival committee. 



$25- Cheerful Giver

With a healthy donation of $25 and above you will receive a letter of gratitude from our Founder Mrs. Carol Mitchell Faulkner herself!I must say, ""WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT TO MAKE THIS DAY A REALITY!""If in fact we do not meet our goal, our funds will still go toward giving the scholarships to the students. The more money we raise the more assistance we can provide. Our goal is to one day award FULL scholarships to students and we will dedicate our lives to making this dream come true.  

Last year our festival was a major success and it was because of the help from our worldwide community that we were able to have a powerful day of awareness. Making a music festival is really challenging especially coming from a family of musicians and management. We usually get invited to perform at festivals and the background work is done way in advance. Seeing the work that needs to be done and having the young people as a point of inspiration is what keeps us going because there are many moments when you want to give up. I will speak for our team and say that giving up isn't an option when you have talent that is overlooked and unappreciated in these young moguls in the making. To put it simply, ""WE NEED YOUR HELP""! 


Use the share tools to spread the word on every social media outlet there is. 


Every piece counts and I promise that you will remember the look on that child's face when they receive their first pair of drum sticks or the first lesson that leads to your child playing your favorite song.  



OUR COMMITTEE WOULD LIKE TO EXTEND ITS DEEPEST HEARTFELT THANKS FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND ENCOURAGEMENT. WITHOUT THE COMMUNITY OUR COMMUNITY THE MUSIC HAS NO MEANING. 
PEACE AND LOVE TO YOU ALL!",11.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<p><b>Hello Everyone! </b></p>
<p>Thank you for visiting my IndieGogo page! </p>
<p>This year I had the amazing opportunity to record an
album…and its almost ready!! </p>
<p>The album, called <i>In
the Place of In Between, </i>is a collection of songs about love and its many
aspects—the highs and the lows, the silly and the serious, and of course,
everything “in between”. </p>
<p>The songs are written by me, my producer Charlie Lewis, and
songwriters Anna Hill, Britta Linburg, Alysia Rogers, and Donna Ulisse.  </p><p>Here is a link to some of the songs in the album: </p><p><a href=""https://soundcloud.com/pbanikmusic/sets/in-between"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://soundcloud.com/pbanikmusic/sets/in-between</a><br/></p>

<p>I love music, being creative, and sharing that creativity
with the world!  That is the short story…
</p>
<p>Here’s the long story: 
</p>
<p>My journey with music started as a first grader, singing
during my first performance at a Bengali cultural festival.  From there it grew to doing more
performances, taking voice lessons, joining my school’s choir and spring
musical, singing in jazz clubs, and even co-founding and leading a South Asian fusion a capella group
at my college.   Along with music however, I was also balancing
academics pretty heavily, and doing both…was tough!  </p>
<p>After
graduating college three years ago, I took a little break from the school life
and finally decided to explore more of my love for music.  I did open mics and joined
musician-networking groups and ended up meeting a musician and producer named
Charlie Lewis.  Charlie had some songs
that he wanted a vocalist for, and I wanted to get my start on songwriting.  Together we decided to make an album—a dream
I’ve had for a long time!</p>
<p>Making this album was an AWESOME experience and a great way to
spend my last year before starting the next phase of my life—medical
school.  And it was an AMAZING learning
experience.  I now understand the many

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<div>Hey there, fellow music-lover! Have you ever wondered why the same standard works are repeated over and over again in concert houses all over the world? Do you believe that there is a good deal of lesser-known repertoire that deserves getting heard more often?  Then you're in excellent company. ""<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/keydiscoveries"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Key discoveries</a>"" is a new piano recital series offering a stage to pianists with a curious mind, eager to  reach far beyond the most often heard repertoire. While it also offers room for traditional repertoire, the central aim of the concerts is to offer something new and unexpected to the concert-goers. A regular piano recital series has long been missing in Helsinki - finally it is becoming reality! The concerts will be video-recorded and shared in part via YouTube, also reaching audiences far away from Finland.</div>
<div>
<p><br/></p>
<p>For the first season, there is a total of six recitals planned. If the final budget allows for more, there will be more concerts planned. Among the concerts taking place in the 15/16 season of ""Key discoveries"" we have:</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>An opening recital by <b><a href=""http://www.kozlovsky.fi/index.php/fi/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Kiril Kozlovsky</a></b>, focusing on 'emigrant composers'.  The Russians <b>Nikolai Medtner </b>and <b>Sergei Rachmaninoff</b> are heard in the second half, and the first half includes music by contemporary composers including <b>Matthew Whittall</b>, <b>Matei Gheorghiu</b>, <b>Pasi Lyytikäinen </b>and <b>Ilari Kaila</b>. The concert will include a world premiere of <b>Mikko Nisula</b>'s Piano Sonata. </p>
<p>Pianist <b>Risto-Matti Marin </b>will act as a host for this opening concert, and will hold a pre-concert discussion with the composers who will be present at the concert. </p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b><a href=""http://www.annachristensson.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Anna Christensson</a></b>'s recital ""Awekening - Swedish 1920's"" offers an unusual and rewarding glimpse into the Swedish musical life of the beginning of the last century. The concert explores three Swedish composers that were active during this time, and through whose deeds the Swedish music tradition finally woke up to the dawn of modernism. We meet the young pioneer <b>Hilding Rosenberg</b> in the early stages of his highly productive artistry that continued until the very end of the 1900's. We meet the vagabond <b>Gösta Nystroem</b>, who spent most of the decade at sea and in Paris. There he experienced the optimism of the new times both as a painter and as a composer. And we meet <b>Henning Mankell </b>(grandfather of the writer with the same name), the shy loner. Eternally in love with the sound-world of the piano, he writes sprawling, dramatic and beautiful works.<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><br/></span></p>
<p><b><a href=""http://oskarekberg.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Oskar Ekberg</a> </b>will present an all-Swedish program ranging from baroque to early 20th century, including works by <b>Johan Helmich Roman</b>, <b>Adolf Fredrik Lindblad</b>,<b> Gustav Düben</b>, <b>Elfrida Andrée </b>and <b>Valborg Aulin. </b>Though considered 'the father of Swedish music', a great deal of <b>Johan Helmich Roman</b>'s music has been obscured by the immensely popular ""Drottningholm music"". Such was the fate of his twelve keyboard suites, until <b>Oskar Ekberg </b>came along and made the premiere recording (on piano) of the entire set. The rest of the concert shines light on other interesting figures in Swedish music life, and also focuses on several somewhat neglected female composers of the 19th century.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b><a href=""https://soundcloud.com/jonasolssonpianist"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Jonas Olsson</a> </b>will perform a program of 'contemporary classics', focusing in particular on music written in the 2000's. <b>Brian Ferneyhough</b>'s classic Lemma-Icon-Epigram is heard along with works by a new generation of composers, some of whom are heard for the first time in Finland! <b>Vassos Nicolaou</b>, <b>Johan Svensson</b>, <b>Art-Oliver Simon</b>, <b>Pedro Alvarez </b>and others will be heard.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b><a href=""http://www.iliadkultur.com/inesebiografi.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Inese Klotina</a> </b>has become well known as a temperamental pianist with particular interest in the music of Nikolai Medtner. For this recital however, she will play a program including music by the Finnish-Swedish composer <b>Laura Netzel</b>, <b>Ture Rangström</b>, <b>Karl Nicklas Gustavsson</b>, as well as works by the Lithuanian composer <b>Mikalojus Konstantinas Čiurlionis</b>.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>...for information about remaining concerts, programs and performers, do stay tuned! Details will be revealed as our crowd-funding campaign continues.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>This project is run by pianist <b><a href=""www.martinmalmgren.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Martin Malmgren</a></b> and composer/producer <b><a href=""http://www.iliadkultur.com/index_eng.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Karl Nicklas Gustavsson</a></b>. Martin has a long-time interest in exploring lesser-heard repertoire, and Nicklas has many years of experience as organizer and producer of concert series and music competitions, such as SIMC (Stockholm International Music  Competition).

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>""Key discoveries"" has so far received generous funds from the Swedish Cultural Foundation and Musiikkin Edestämissäätiö. However, the rental of the concert hall turned out to be higher than we expected, and we also want to pay all pianists an acceptable sum for their performances. As it is hard to estimate how much incomes we will have through ticket/program sales, we are still in need of more funds.</div>
<div>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Contributing to this project will help in starting out something new, important and valuable to the cultural life in Helsinki. We are starting out with a highly limited budget and with only six concerts per season, but if the series will receive enough attention, it will have the chance of receiving more funds for future series. By contributing, you will help the ball start rolling. Larger funds for future seasons would give us the possibility to invite international artists, as well as organizing seminars and masterclasses. Anyone that contributes will receive something in return, as all of the concerts will be recorded and released in part via YouTube. A website will soon be up, and it is our idea that a website for a concert series of this kind will also be educational, and include extensive information about the composers that are highlighted and their times, as well as the pianists invited to perform.</p>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>As things stand right now, any contributions through this campaign will be crucial to having the concert series launched the way that it is planned. With a lack of funds, we will have to limit the amount of concerts further, which is not something we would like to do at this point. Meanwhile, we are also applying for scholarships through various cultural foundations. If we are lucky enough to reach our goal with such help, all donations received through this campaign will serve other goals, such as:
</div>
<div>
<p><br/></p>
<p>* Raising the somewhat limited compensation for the pianists invited</p>
<p>* Recording all concerts professionally, with more amount of microphones and cameras, and covering costs for editing the material</p>
<p>* Spending more money on advertisement</p>
<p>* Including one or two more concerts in the series</p>
<p>* Saving money for the following season</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">What we hope is that this initiative will reach out to audiences and make them discover music they otherwise would not have come across, played by pianists they likely would not have heard otherwise. </span></div>
<div><br/></div>
<p></p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div>As long as we raise enough money for this project, there are no significant challenges ahead. One challenge in these early stages is going to be to advertise the series - Helsinki has a lot to offer on the music scene as it is, and there is a risk that an event of this kind will drown amid all other musical happenings. Our idea is to have a concert series that is welcoming towards everyone - therefore, we would like to keep the concerts free of charge, but with sales of concert programs for anyone that is interested. As the concert series also is meant to be educational, we program leaflets will cover a wide range of topics relevant to the music being performed.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>The best way to help us is to spread the word, and perhaps offer advice and suggestions! You are most welcome to put a 'like' on our Facebook page to find out the most recent about ""Key discoveries""!</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/keydiscoveries"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/keydiscoveries</a><br/></p>

Our idea is to have a concert series that is welcoming towards everyone - therefore, we would like to keep the concerts free of charge, but with sales of concert programs for anyone that is interested. As the concert series also is meant to be educational, we program leaflets will cover a wide range of topics relevant to the music being performed.


Other Ways You Can Help
The best way to help us is to spread the word, and perhaps offer advice and suggestions! You are most welcome to put a 'like' on our Facebook page to find out the most recent about ""Key discoveries""!

https://www.facebook.com/keydiscoveries

Additionally, we are always happy to communicate with anyone interested in finding out more about the series, and anyone willing to help us out in other ways! Suggestions on repertoire, interesting pianists, composers and whatnot are certainly most welcome. Feel free to send an email to:

<p>The violin-accordion duo <b>Cricket &amp; Snail</b> is in the process
of releasing a NEW CD entitled <b>Street
Symphonies</b>! But we need your help. We’ve got the
recordings and $500 already raised, but we are not there yet financially
to fund the production costs ($1000 for the CDs + $500 for song licensing= $1500) so we still need $1000. We are offering some incentives as well including a copy of
the CD (for $20 contribution) and a house concert (for $250). (For more see
below.)<br/>
<span>The title Street Symphonies refers to
inclusion of 5 symphony movements arranged for violin and accordion on the
program.  These are cleverly and effectively arranged pieces that we have
played on the streets of Prague. Other songs on the CD have street themes as well
(Pigalle, Der Gasn Nigun/2nd Avenue Square Dance, Theme for Mon
Oncle and Raglan Road). We look forward to sharing our latest mix of French,
Klezmer, Celtic and classical tunes with you soon!<span></span></span></p><p><b>Listen</b> to a preview of <i>Street Symphonies</i> here: <br/></p><p><a href=""https://soundcloud.com/cricket-and-snail/street-symphonies-cd-preview"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://soundcloud.com/cricket-and-snail/street-symphonies-cd-preview</a><br/></p><p><span><span>

<b>My Background &amp; The Recording Of ""Northern Town""  <br/><br/></b>I have been a working musician in the Niagara area since the spring of 1979. I have always written my own songs, but it took me until 2005 to finally record and release my first album, ""Ghosts,"" and the main reason it took so long was a lack of the money to do it. Life certainly enjoys throwing its curves my way. Thanks to the help of many friends, I was able to get that album done on a relatively small budget. I immediately began to write songs for a new album, and now it is ten years later, and I'm ready to do a second one, but I am going to need some help to accomplish it. I want to do a bit more musically this time, with bass and percussion and keyboards, and get a bunch of CD's actually manufactured this time, and every little bit will help bring me closer to my goal. The first recording session has already taken place. Now it's time to get this thing going and get it finished.<br/><br/>My goal is to raise about $1600. That should cover the cost of the recording sessions, paying the musicians, and getting 300 CD's manufactured at the end. It's not a lot of money, but for a person working hard on minimum wage, as I am, there isn't a lot extra to go around. My music has always been the most important thing in my life, outside of my family, and the new songs are good and just begging to be put out there properly. My fans have been asking me for a new album for years now. ""Ghosts"" was extremely well-received, and I feel this new album will be even better. The new album is based around my experiences during vacation times spent on the Bruce Peninsula. It will be a positive, spiritually uplifting record.<br/><br/>In return for your contributions, everyone who donates money to my cause will receive an autographed copy of the new album, which will be in CD/Digipak format. I will also do a draw for two contributors to receive a private concert at their home, provided that they live within driving distance for me from Niagara, and we are able to set up a suitable, convenient date. </div><br/></div>","My Background & The Recording Of ""Northern Town""  I have been a working musician in the Niagara area since the spring of 1979.

<p></p>
<h3>Short story</h3>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">Hello! For those of you who haven't met us yet, we are Caleidofonio, a musical group formed by six musicians that want to invite you to perceive reality in a different way. With original songs and improvisations that promote the suspension of disbelief, we extend our hand and welcome you to listen and see everything that we sometimes give for granted when we see it with the eyes of habit.</div>
<div>In the last months we managed to record our first album, <i>Suspension Of Disbelief</i> , and this has made us very happy because we got to enjoy every part of a process in which  the songs that once were just a fragment of our imagination, finally materialized. We went through the phase of composing and arranging, we gathered to rehearse the songs with a lot of enthusiasm and went to the recording studio to have some fun; achieving the sound of our dreams through the processes of mixing and mastering.  Finally we got to translate the universe of every song into illustrations that build up a beautiful booklet that narrates several ways of perception.</div>
<div>
<p>With all of this ready, there's only one more step: Making everything possible so that this album that we love so much is finally available to get to you, either in a physical format or in a digital platform. We want it to get as far as it can go. We also want to make a big launching concert with other artists, dancers, and acrobats.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>What we need and what you get</h3>
</div>
<p>For this we need 4,500 dollars that will be distributed the following way:</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438611258/ldmcekwl6xpfwikcmyz9.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p>By helping us with our dream, you deserve to get several rewards which range from getting the digital copy of the album, all the way to getting a concerts in your house or via streaming, the signed physical copy of the album, and several other surprises. </p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal, we're using the funds mainly for the physical copies of the album and it's digital distribution.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<div>In this world that is moved by habit frenzy and it's mechanical movements, sometimes we need to remember that, in the most unsuspected corners of reality, universes full of beauty and wonder are hidden, and we want our songs to be a reminder of that search; an invitation to perceive reality in other ways. Help us build a world where the Great Habit and the disbelief are suspended with more frequency, and extend this invitation to every one that could enjoy our proposal.</div>
<div><p></p></div>
<p></p>
<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>

(¡Baja un poco para la versión en Español!)


Short story
Hello! For those of you who haven't met us yet, we are Caleidofonio, a musical group formed by six musicians that want to invite you to perceive reality in a different way. With original songs and improvisations that promote the suspension of disbelief, we extend our hand and welcome you to listen and see everything that we sometimes give for granted when we see it with the eyes of habit.
In the last months we managed to record our first album, Suspension Of Disbelief , and this has made us very happy because we got to enjoy every part of a process in which  the songs that once were just a fragment of our imagination, finally materialized. We went through the phase of composing and arranging, we gathered to rehearse the songs with a lot of enthusiasm and went to the recording studio to have some fun; achieving the sound of our dreams through the processes of mixing and mastering.  Finally we got to translate the universe of every song into illustrations that build up a beautiful booklet that narrates several ways of perception.

With all of this ready, there's only one more step: Making everything possible so that this album that we love so much is finally available to get to you, either in a physical format or in a digital platform. We want it to get as far as it can go. We also want to make a big launching concert with other artists, dancers, and acrobats.

What we need and what you get

For this we need 4,500 dollars that will be distributed the following way:




By helping us with our dream, you deserve to get several rewards which range from getting the digital copy of the album, all the way to getting a concerts in your house or via streaming, the signed physical copy of the album, and several other surprises. 
If we don't reach our goal, we're using the funds mainly for the physical copies of the album and it's digital distribution.

Impact
In this world that is moved by habit frenzy and it's mechanical movements, sometimes we need to remember that, in the most unsuspected corners of reality, universes full of beauty and wonder are hidden, and we want our songs to be a reminder of that search; an invitation to perceive reality in other ways. Help us build a world where the Great Habit and the disbelief are suspended with more frequency, and extend this invitation to every one that could enjoy our proposal.


Risks and challenges
In Colombia, crowdfunding campaigns like this one are still a relatively unknown method for independent artists like us to raise funds for their projects. This might difficult the diffusion and support of our campaign at a national level. Never the less, we are hopeful because we believe in the quality and the emotional and esthetic value of our music. We've also been shown by the raising number of artists and creators that there is a great collective need to break the Great Habit and be able to see reality in different ways, which is why we believe that our proposal will be in sync with every person that is in that search. We are more than willing to share every week in this campaign, music and videos that inspired us to open reality for us, hoping that you get to experience something similar.


Other ways to contribute
We know that it's not always possible to contribute economically, but if you like our music and our proposal, we invite you to share our campaign using the several Indiegogo tools, and you will greatly help us achieve our dreams.

<div> </div>
<p><b>Subway Talents</b> was born as a solution to numerous problems we had involving the underground subway performing scenery. We love subway performers, but it was difficult to enjoy full shows of their performance, because we were always on the run trying to catch the train to our next destination. It’s extremely rare to run into the same subway performer the next day at the same spot. We had a lot of curiosity about subway performers, so we begin searching online with the hope of finding a platform specifically designed to learn more about subway performers or discover their next performance in advanced, but it was very difficult to find a specific online platform cater to subway performers. Out of frustration we decided to take it upon ourselves to find a solution to this problem by creating Subway Talents.</p>

It’s extremely rare to run into the same subway performer the next day at the same spot. We had a lot of curiosity about subway performers, so we begin searching online with the hope of finding a platform specifically designed to learn more about subway performers or discover their next performance in advanced, but it was very difficult to find a specific online platform cater to subway performers. Out of frustration we decided to take it upon ourselves to find a solution to this problem by creating Subway Talents.

 
 
 
Why We Are Raising Money
We are raising money because after launching we notice a rapid growth in our website visitors, audience and performers wanting to be featured on the website. There are so much performers to cover, and so many business related tasks that needs to be done. At the moment we are really short on staff we need funds to grow our video team.


We are backed up with videos that need to be edit, a lot of new and old performers that need to be recorded, a lot of shows to cover, and so much more. We also need money to upgrade our video equipment so we can capture great high quality content to provide to both, the performers and the audience.  

 
Equipment Need:

$1,270.99 Camera: Panasonic Lumix DMC-GH4 4K
$1,397.99 Lens:  Panasonic H-NS043 Lumix G Leica DG Nocticron 42.5mm/F1.2 Lens
$629.95 Lavalier Mic: Sennheiser EW112P G3 A-Band Wireless Lav Mic Bundle
We plan to spend $5,500 to hire additional staff to keep up with video production and new artists.The rest of the money will cover Indiegogo fees.

<h3><strong><strong><strong><br/></strong></strong></strong></h3>
<p><strong><strong><strong><strong>Hi my name is Xavier, my stage name is ""Xclusive"" I'm 10 years old, I have been given an opportunity of a lifetime to audition for Sony Music a major recording company. I need your help in order to record my professional EP which is a four song demo and music video. </strong><strong> I am concerned with the message that other recording artist are sending to children my age.  I am being raised by my supportive parents Mr. &amp; Mrs. Bates. </strong></strong></strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><strong><strong><strong>Education is very important to me, I maintain a straight A average in school. I rewarded my parents by studying hard  and staying out of trouble.  Music is a big part of the lives of kids my age. Most all of the music the kids listen to is negative, about selling drugs, or calling woman and young girls bad words. </strong></strong></strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><strong><strong>I want to spread a positive message to other students and kids. Lots of my friends learned profanity from the records they listen to.  It doesn't have to be that way. Will you help me make a difference for children all over the United States? I take pride in being a young role model. I love to educate and mentor other kids with homework and help them in areas where they are struggling in school </strong></strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Mr. June Walton and Mr. Youngblood my mentors stated:  ""Its very rare for anyone, especially kids who are pre-occupied with their cell phones and  problems in life to make a decision to be a positive role models"" It gets sad sometimes with all the bad news in the media and all the negativity around us. I just want to make someone happy. </strong></p>
<p><strong>What makes me happiest is knowing  the parents would be okay buying my music. Since I do not talk about drugs or gangs or anything negative.  It will give the kids a break from all the music that teaches them to be a part of gangs, do drugs and treat girls and women with no respect. I see this everyday at school, and you can help me change minds and attitudes. </strong></p>
<p><strong> I was told and I believe that you are never too young to be a role model.  I know everyone needs someone to help them with their dreams.</strong></p>
<p><strong>As a young person my parents told me I have choices, It is important to me to do something positive in the world. Instead of being in gangs or using drugs I have decided to do something positive with my life. This positive experience  will help carry me through a challenging life ahead. I can be strong in knowing that people believed in me. This experience will give me a chance to pay it forward in the lives of others kids who may feel alone or rejected.  </strong></p>
<p><strong>Well, I can't talk as much as the adults, so I am running out of words, choose a perk and please help me accomplish my dreams. Remember you are investing in the life of a child who is seeking to be a positive influence in our world. If for nothing else the fact that I am trying to do something positive is worth paying it forward in my life. I will always pay it forward for someone else thank you very much Xavier ""Xclusive"" Bates.</strong></p>

like self-esteem, social interaction, negative/positive perception, quiet time,
forgiveness, food, and more! Many positive lifestyle topics.These subjects are important to children in the
target age group of 5-9.  To date, one book has
been written and privately printed to get feedback and another book is in the story-blocking
process to be submitted for publication with a company. </span></p>
<p>I was able to do a public school reading for 3rd
graders and when I asked how many had experienced what happened to Penni in the
story, about half of the room raised their hands. This experience speaks to the
need for this material. The teachers loved it too!</p>
<p><b>Process Page at the End of the Book</b></p>
<p>The stories create opportunities for kids to talk to
about their personal experiences with their parents, and process through their feelings.  Parents can use the
content and Miranda's special process page int he back to jumpstart family discussions about choices and family values. This can create skills in children to serve them a lifetime and create unforgettable memories between the parent and child. </p>

<p><b>The Music</b></p>

lives, both young and old.  Just think

<p><b>About The Author Miranda Sullivan and The Inspiration Behind The Series</b></p>
<p>I have been a Professional Nanny for 8 years and now am a Certified Positive
Discipline Educator, lyricist and author. I have worked for over 10 years with
kids in capacities such as a nanny, motivational speaker, a coordinator for a
Church Children's Choir, and a reading tutor for high-risk teens.</p>
<p>I came up with the idea for 'Positive Penni' because of a little
girl I used to nanny. I remember her using the word ""ugly"" to
describe a rainy day.  I told her it was a beautiful day in disguise
because the rain was feeding the grass, flowers and trees.  A few days
later, when it rained again, she called it 'a beautiful day'.  Like the
character in my book, her focus was suddenly on the positive rather than the
negative.</p>
<p>The creation of “The Adventures of Positive Penni” have been a
gift. I truly believe that I was given this idea to fill a void that is needed
for children ages 5-9. I would have loved to have something like this book
series with music when I was a child. I guarantee it would have made a
difference in how I viewed my world, made decisions, in my relationships at
work, personal relationships and how I felt about myself.  How children view themselves makes all the
difference in the experience they have in this life. </p>

<p></p>
<p>The goal is to raise $5500 to cover the musical
production and initial publication costs and the creation the EP, printing of books,and a promotional video. The financing will help get the project up and going.  I am also praying that we are able to go
above and beyond the $5,500.  This extra
money will be put to good use with advertising, additional book printing, and
development of future books.<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> </span></p>

</div></div>","This campaign is to
raise funding for the initial publication of the first book in a series, and
for recording and mastering of associated songs. it is a story coloringbook witn music to reitterate the message. 

Positive Encouraging Music and a Heartfelt Adventure to Increase Kids Self Esteem!



(Note of changes: the title has been changed to match the message of the book and the song ""Trust What You Know"" and it is a story coloring book, allowing create the color they want to!
The Books“The Adventures of Positive Penni” is a series of books with adventures for Penni and her animal friends that will cover subjects
like self-esteem, social interaction, negative/positive perception, quiet time,
forgiveness, food, and more! Many positive lifestyle topics.These subjects are important to children in the
target age group of 5-9.  To date, one book has
been written and privately printed to get feedback and another book is in the story-blocking
process to be submitted for publication with a company. 
I was able to do a public school reading for 3rd
graders and when I asked how many had experienced what happened to Penni in the
story, about half of the room raised their hands. This experience speaks to the
need for this material. The teachers loved it too!
Process Page at the End of the Book
The stories create opportunities for kids to talk to
about their personal experiences with their parents, and process through their feelings.  Parents can use the
content and Miranda's special process page int he back to jumpstart family discussions about choices and family values. This can create skills in children to serve them a lifetime and create unforgettable memories between the parent and child. 

The Music
The music for Positive Penni, combined with the messages in the books, together are a driving force for the success of  the series to come.  Children just love the catchy tunes and words! 
The Singers and Production


Jessica Collins
CH Henry
Faith Dengate
The Positive Penni singers ages 9-12;  Faith Dengate, Jessica Collins and CH Henry are some of the children that will record the songs that Miranda Sullivan co-wrote. with other writers.  Miranda's songs that need to be recorded are: The Adventures of Positive Penni Theme song, and ""Trust What You Know""  these 2 songs will be included with the book along with Laurie O""Shea's ""Perfectly You.""  (that has already been recorded) and then the other songs, ""Keep On Believing In Me,"" ""Find Your Own Voice"" and ""I Can Do It On My Own"" will be offered later on, keeping a connection with the families. The recordings will take place at the Music Row's Parlor Studio. 

Positive Penni Is Already Making A Difference!


The songs and the book speak for themselves in touching the
hearts of kids. The project isn't complete yet, but has already touched so many
lives, both young and old.  Just think
what it can do for thousands of kids once it's complete.  Over the creation of this project, I have not
spoken with one parent who hasn't said “I love it, the kids need it, and I want
a book!”

Faith Dengate's story.
Positive Penni is an avenue for kids to learn to care for themselves and process through their feelings. ""I wish I would have had something like this when I was a kid, my life would have changed for the better."" Miranda Sullivan
Faith Dengate's mother - Amy Dengate

Opportunity For Growth Through Public Performances and Community Involvment
Positive Penni is also offering it's singers opportunities to sing in the public. They have been invited to and will have shows at churches, Girl Scout of Middle TN meetings , family businesses, schools, and other opportunies that present themselves.  Go the www.positivepenni.com for their up and coming schedule. 


We are in the midst of getting approval for 10 Percent of the proceeds for this book will be given to the Girl Scouts of Middle TN.

<p><br/></p> <p>This is Moses Mo from the Funk Rock group Mother's Finest.  Some of you may know me as Gary Moore from Kettering, Ohio, others may call me ""MO"" or ""Moses"".  I began this journey fresh out of high school, no expectations, just wanting to play music for a living.  I met a couple playing in another band at a club across the street from a place where I played at and was asked to join them in Florida.  The rest became history.  My love for creating music grew along with my career.  Once comfortable as a guitarist, songwriting then grew into a passion, exploring what lyrics could do combined with music, one of my earliest compositions will be included as a bonus for this project performed by 3D Poet, a name I've given to a group of works I share with my daughter and her husband.  <br/></p>
<p>Over time I've had the opportunity to write with many talented artists, most of the songs were co-written and recorded by Mother's Finest, but also recorded by the group Illusion (USA/Geffen/Universal), Caroline Aiken, Carl Carlton and The Songdogs, along the way I established a collections of songs, waiting to be recorded by someone and that someone turned out to be me.  I released a debut solo project entitled CARTOON YOU, these songs were my babies.  I began the process of becoming an independent artist and learned what so many had been doing for me along the way.  I became a producer, an engineer, a vocalist, and enlisted many of my friends with skills far greater than mine, to help me create my first solo endeavor.  I created a record company and became a publisher, distributor, and promoter of my songs.  I am pleased to announce the birth of another!</p>
<p>My family fully funded the debut project, this time, I am asking ALL OF YOU, to support this next step in the journey.  In the beginning it was just about the music, but I am now aware of how much that ""music"" costs just to get it to the people who want to listen and be a part of my experience.  By pre-ordering this new music project titled ""2 TON MESSAGE"", you become a part of the process.  The songs have already been recorded and mixed.  The next step is mastering and then, production of products, you decide what should be offered.  By helping to fund and promote this project, you are getting the first release of 2 TON MESSAGE, and anything else you would like to have as a contributing member at any level.</p>
<p>A successfully funded campaign will allow me to connect with others by doing what I love most and will help establish a tour of dates to perform the songs from CARTOON YOU and 2 TON MESSAGE.  Your support means EVERYTHING!  The industry will be watching, you can help get their attention and hear some great songs!  It takes a village to raise a baby!  <br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>There's a lot of different facets to making a record.  I spent several years just writing the songs.  Sometimes beginning with a few notes, a few words, inspired often from the chaos in my own head.  I practice everyday, several hours at a time or for a few minutes whenever I can, sometimes on my travel, student size guitar, other times on an acoustic or electric guitar.  This practice then leads to organizing the parts into an original piece of music, I record these into a small recorder with a microphone, jot down some of the lyrics or open a session and begin with a drum track.  Each song may go thru many revisions before actually becoming a song I would like to group with others to make a project.  This is perhaps the longest part of the process.  <br/></p>
<p>I've completed ALL the songs and ALL have been recorded, the next part is getting the mix.  The payoff of all that recording of the music.  Much like building a ratrod, all the nonessential parts are removed, and the polishing occurs.  I now have 8 out of 12 mixes ready for mastering.</p>
<p>This is where the funding begins:</p>
<p>Most of the musicians have agreed to be paid by tracks used.  This said, I used a bass player, a drummer, and myself.  There are special guests appearance throughout the project.  This cost is approximately $3600  ($100 X 12 X 3)</p>
<p>Mixing - this requires special equipment that I don't have in my home studio and an experienced, outstanding set of ears, the engineer.  This cost is approximately $1200  ($100 X 12)<br/></p>
<p>Mastering - this is where all the peaks and valleys from track to track is balanced out so you hear one continuous piece from song to song without too much adjustment on the equipment you are using to listen back with.  Several different masters will be made, the one for downloads, CD/USB production, and vinyl.  This cost is approximately $800  (40 min. X $20 a minute)</p>
<p>Production of Product:  (Your reward for your contribution)</p>
<p>There are a variety of ways to supply listeners with music.  There are many distributors with offers to provide downloads, CDs, USBs, and Vinyl.  My idea is to offer the album art work and you decide the format you would like to receive the music. All packages will come with a full size album jacket just like in the old days. I think every band should use old school album jackets and we could hang them on the wall and enjoy!<br/></p>
<p>Artwork is approximately $250 (Album sleeve, CD cover, brand logo)</p>
<p>Printing:</p>
<p>2 Panel, 12"" Record Jacket - (min. quantity 200)  $5.47ea X 200 = $1094</p>
<p>Credit Card style USB - (100 - 2G card stock, 1 side with white housing) <br/></p>
<p>$7.28 X 100 = $728</p>
<p>Digipak CD - (min. 1000) $1.65 X 1000 = $1650</p>
<p>12"" 180gm Vinyl record (min. 300) = $2663</p>
<p>Promotional Items:</p>
<p>T-shirt (200) 5.35 X 200 = $1070<br/></p>
<p>Posters (min. 300)  $198</p>
<p>Post Cards (min. 1000)  $95</p>
<p>Cover Art Stickers (100 min.)  $65</p>
<p>Postage and handling:</p>
<p>Domestic Priority Mail:  $5-20 (200+) = $1000+<br/></p>
<p>International Priority Mail:  $25-50 (200+) = $5000+</p>
<p>it costs more to offer a package like this but I'm not through with album covers yet!i would love to have it the way I remember it and it was good!!<br/></p>
<p>Unique perks:</p>
<p>Anyone funding the project $100 or more will also have their names added as super supporters of the project on All printed and social media.<br/></p>
<p>Lead sheets and Lyrics - $50 per song</p>
<p>Studio Work: $500 - 4 hour session - guitar tracks by MosesMo  This can be done thru the internet through a secure file sharing site.  You can send your session and I'll add my tracks and return it to you for review. (Travel, Lodging, Hospitality extra for out of town sessions).<br/></p>
<p> Song Demo - $1000  I'll create the tracks needed for your song . I'll use all my resources and come up with a cool track you will love.<br/></p>
<p>Record Release Party - $1500  We'll use your venue to perform songs from 2 Ton Message and Cartoon You (standard venue contract, back line and sufficient PA, travel, lodging, hospitality extra)<br/></p>
<p>VIP Executive Producer:  $2500 will have name, business, listed everywhere on everything made possible b/c you're an ANGEL!  Managers, Booking Agents, Venues, local businesses, etc.  A private special occasion will be planned to thank you for your support and will receive every perk offered.<br/></p>
<p>Giving back - if we exceed our GOAL 10% will be donated to a charitable organization</p>
<p>Not making our goal means we have to take care of business first, the 12 songs will be mastered, copyright fees for published project will be paid, fees for website downloads will be paid, Album covers will be printed, CDs will be ordered, and rewards delivered to those who made the choice to support Independent Artists!  Man, I don't want to cross anything off but we'll have to cross that bridge when we get to it.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I've been extremely fortunate and I'm deeply grateful for the life, 
experiences, and relationships that I've had.  Each day, I strive to be better than the day before .  I have a 
whole lot more to give but I need your support.  I'm asking you because you are the only ones who really make a difference.  You listen and decide.  My entire career has 
been an outstandingly awesome event, my loyalty, love, and respect for 
those I've worked with has taken me to great heights in my life.  This is something I am compelled to do, I've 
got a message, a 2 TON MESSAGE, that will be delivered but your support 
will make it happen that much quicker.  I'm OLDER and BOLDER, not afraid to try something new, I hope you won't be either! <br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I promise to you, that I will give this project ALL that I have to give, to deliver to you a professionally AWESOME piece of me in the quickest time possible.  This project will go for 45 days, some may lose interest or simply forget but we have to remind them.  I will share music, moments, photos, and whatever else comes to me but I can't do this alone. That's why they call this CROWDFUNDING!  I need a CROWD for support of this project.   Tell your friends, family, co-workers, EVERYBODY, that Moses has a NEW MUSIC PROJECT of 10 uniquely original songs and that I'm letting supporters preview and be a part of the process!  Tell them to pre-order NOW and support an Independent Artist. This is the first time, on my own, no one else making the decisions, no one else directing, learning as I go.  This is an opportunity, not a RISK!  Let's make this happen!<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I'm not just asking for financial support, there are many ways to support this project, share the links, share the music, the photos, etc.  The internet has such connectivity!  On Facebook, share with friends, post links or photos, On Twitter?  I am, follow me and share the posts, links, and photos you find there, might even catch me in a conversation, let me know what you think about the songs!  Invite others to follow me!  Instagram, yea, share a photo of your perks and yes, the one you take with me!  Everyone supporting the project will have the chance to take a selfie with me.  That sounded odd but taking pictures are a wonderful way to show support!  YouTube, you betcha!  Write a blog, newsletter, articles for magazines?  Include a little something about the project, or just ask and we'll do an interview!  Help me get the word out.  If you've read this far, there is nothing else left but to use the Indiegogo share tools, make enough noise that people will have to listen, then, they can decide if they want to support the project and pre-order the CD or whatever format they want the music delivered to them as.  Let's do this! Let's keep the music coming!<br/></p>Even if you can't contribute, there is something here for you.  We will be releasing videos and the tracks from the album on YouTube, just enjoy and tell your friends, that's the important thing!  We're trying to build an army of like minded funkrockers and you're invited!  MOSES<br/>

  The Impact
I've been extremely fortunate and I'm deeply grateful for the life, 
experiences, and relationships that I've had.  Each day, I strive to be better than the day before .  I have a 
whole lot more to give but I need your support.  I'm asking you because you are the only ones who really make a difference.  You listen and decide.  My entire career has 
been an outstandingly awesome event, my loyalty, love, and respect for 
those I've worked with has taken me to great heights in my life.  This is something I am compelled to do, I've 
got a message, a 2 TON MESSAGE, that will be delivered but your support 
will make it happen that much quicker.  I'm OLDER and BOLDER, not afraid to try something new, I hope you won't be either! 
  Risks & Challenges
I promise to you, that I will give this project ALL that I have to give, to deliver to you a professionally AWESOME piece of me in the quickest time possible.  This project will go for 45 days, some may lose interest or simply forget but we have to remind them.  I will share music, moments, photos, and whatever else comes to me but I can't do this alone. That's why they call this CROWDFUNDING!  I need a CROWD for support of this project.   Tell your friends, family, co-workers, EVERYBODY, that Moses has a NEW MUSIC PROJECT of 10 uniquely original songs and that I'm letting supporters preview and be a part of the process!  Tell them to pre-order NOW and support an Independent Artist. This is the first time, on my own, no one else making the decisions, no one else directing, learning as I go.  This is an opportunity, not a RISK!  Let's make this happen!
  Other Ways You Can Help
I'm not just asking for financial support, there are many ways to support this project, share the links, share the music, the photos, etc.  The internet has such connectivity!  On Facebook, share with friends, post links or photos, On Twitter?  I am, follow me and share the posts, links, and photos you find there, might even catch me in a conversation, let me know what you think about the songs!  Invite others to follow me!  Instagram, yea, share a photo of your perks and yes, the one you take with me!  Everyone supporting the project will have the chance to take a selfie with me.  That sounded odd but taking pictures are a wonderful way to show support!  YouTube, you betcha!  Write a blog, newsletter, articles for magazines?  Include a little something about the project, or just ask and we'll do an interview!  Help me get the word out.  If you've read this far, there is nothing else left but to use the Indiegogo share tools, make enough noise that people will have to listen, then, they can decide if they want to support the project and pre-order the CD or whatever format they want the music delivered to them as.  Let's do this! Let's keep the music coming!Even if you can't contribute, there is something here for you.  We will be releasing videos and the tracks from the album on YouTube, just enjoy and tell your friends, that's the important thing!  We're trying to build an army of like minded funkrockers and you're invited!  MOSES",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

journey full of huge joy and great frustration, and getting through it all has
indeed made me a much better person. Help a man repay his mom an incredible
debt of gratitude for gifting his life with beautiful original music. Your
contribution to this project is a testament of the profoundly inspiring and
healing relationship between mother and child, a central aspect of being a
moral sentient being. Thank you in advance for your consideration and here is our story...</p>
<p>Since I was a boy my Mom, Margarita Figueroa, would sing the most amazing
songs to me and my siblings. Each morning a new song would fill
the house, and her voice would raise us out of bed as she cooked our breakfast.
We would always eat our food watching her prepare to go to work, never once thinking
about the incredible sacrifice she was making for us.</p>
<p>On the weekends, she would sit by my side on my bed and sing a new song
she had worked out that morning with her guitar. The whole time, I thought she
was listening to records or the radio and watching TV to learn and practice all
those great songs that she would play for us. So, I came to believe in discipline
through total devotion and applied this philosophy to my training as a Latin
percussionist, practicing up to 9 hours a day for long periods at a time.</p>
<p>One day I was asked to write a song by my friend Mikey Rivera for the La
Juventúd Típica band in Chicago. He was an awesome bass player, and we
were in this band together. At that time Mikey was the smartest guy I
knew. I used to think it was because he went to Francis Parker High School for
privileged kids on scholarship, but as I became a man, I realized he was just
smart. So, not to disappoint him, I gave it a try.</p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p>When I told my Mom how hard it was for me to write a song, she told me that
it wasn't hard at all. She told me to just explore what my heart is feeling and
what my mind is thinking, and I'd have a song in no time. I smugly asked her
how could she know that. She turned to me in her calm demeanor and said,
""Toñito, I've been writing a new song every day since you were 3 years
old. If I can do it having only gone to the 3rd grade, surely you can do it,
being so intelligent."" After picking my jaw up from the floor, I proceeded
to try to prove that she couldn't have written ALL those songs, day in
and day out, with no one to help or praise her! No, I thought, she can't
possibly understand what I mean.</p>
<p>After checking every possible avenue of music, every library, every radio
station for weeks on end, I couldn't find ANY of her songs. I began to exhibit
symptoms of depression. Not because my Mom was more prolific than I could ever
hope to be, but because I didn't believe her.  No one ever complimented her on her massive daily
efforts. No one ever encouraged her to continue writing or to look for a record
deal or a song publishing entity. Furthermore, because of her humility, she was never able to tell us that she was the one writing all those beautiful
songs we would hear her sing and play every day. Something in me had changed. A
seriousness for music and it's therapeutic power to heal us overcame me. </p>
<p>We lived in Humboldt Park, Chicago -- a gang infested, punishing urban
environment. Thinking back to all those times she made me feel better when
I thought our world was ending just by singing a song that she was composing
while singing it right then and there just for me and exactly for the difficult
situation I had just described, I realized she literally saved <i>most</i> of
our lives with her inspired original music. I say ""most"" because my
little brother was killed at age 17.</p>
<p>So I wrote the song my friend Mikey requested, it was waxed and released
on the Ebirac Records label. I grew up, went to college, moved away from
Chicago to Los Angeles and pursued a music career as a Latin percussionist. I
played and recorded with Mongo Santamaria, Herbie Hancock, Maxwell, Brian
McKnight, Sting, Kenny Loggins, Vikki Carr, Billy Preston, The Pointer Sisters,
Patti Austin, Biz Marquis, Mark Anthony, The Temptations, Jeffery Osborne, Ivan
Neville, and many others...But never could I ever fathom writing a song or two
every day, or composing as I played to heal someone's heart from hurting. And,
with all due respect, none of the musicians I ever worked with did that either -- no
matter how prolific, how famous or how much they're considered to be geniuses.</p>
<p>I decided to record my Mom's CD myself. I saved my tour money and built a
recording studio, learned the process of audio production from George Black (an
incredible producer in Los Angeles), Dave Hampton (an innovative audio engineer) and Shawn Rivera (an awesome vocalist of Az Yet fame). I began recording my Mom singing every
time she came to visit me in Los Angeles (she now lives in Aurora, Illinois,
just outside of Chicago). Once she arrived, I would throw these song parties
where she would sing and make everyone cry. We would witness this time and
again until it became a dare to see who would show up and attempt not to cry
while she sang and played guitar. Those were incredible times.</p>
<p>Producing is kind of like Latin percussion in that it requires a skill set
anchored in multiple disciplines. But despite that, I was REALLY bad at it, so
I decided to co-produce any chance I got, and eventually came to produce on my
own to better hone my skills. When several of the artists I produced told me they liked my production
style I began work on this CD, checking in with George Black, Dave Hampton and Shawn Rivera and their infinite
patience, knowledge and generosity to make sure I wasn't making any major mistakes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And here we are. My Mom is an angel from heaven that I was lucky to have as my parents (she was both my Mom and my dad.) Now, through your generosity,
her dream will finally be realized and we'll be better off for it. I say
this with the utmost conviction that you will be touched by her voice, changed by
her words and moved by her songs. You don’t even have to know Spanish to feel the
grace and power of her voice and be forever transformed into
believing that music is a sacred healing force for good. Who knows, perhaps you'll be inspired to write a song or two yourself.</p>

PERSONAL BACKGROUND:  

In high school I studied Jazz Theory & Ensemble for college credit under Michael Carenbauer (who studied under Pat Metheny at Berklee) at the University of AR Little Rock. While completing a bachelor's degree in Recording Industry at Middle TN State, I lived in or near Nashville from 1997 - 2005 and played with such international jazz greats as Les McCann, Tony Monaco, Dr. Lonnie Smith, John Jorgensen and Jeff Coffin. I also worked with such talents as Roland Gresham, The Tao Jones, Sam Brooker, Greg Bryant, Chris West, Moe Denham, Nioshi Jackson and Charles Treadway.
After moving to central Virginia in 2005, I have been privileged to play with such artists as Robert Jospe, John D'earth, Bobby Read, Charles Owens, Jonah Kane-West, The Rootdowns, Lew Taylor, Graham Spice, Juliana Marques, The Nicholson Brothers, Liz Barnes, Ray Caddell, any many more. I have also shared the stage with blues legend Bob Margolin, Vegas staple Wayne Newton, and the DJ Williams Projekt. 

I currently live in Roanoke VA, performing music regionally and teaching at the Music Lab at Jefferson Center.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><div> <h3>What's the Plan?</h3>
<p>What’s
the biggest obstacle to any unsigned, unmanaged band trying to tour? Money,
100% of the time. When someone’s trying to go to college but can’t afford it,
what do they do? Apply for loans, scholarships, and other financial aid.
However, no such thing exists for metal bands. In the spirit of Brian Shields,
a man who always made it his priority to do whatever he could for bands, no
matter how small, we’re aiming to set up, in his honor, essentially a
“fund” for unsigned bands in the metal community. <br/></p> <p>With the support of heavyblogisheavy.com, if this crowd fund is successful, our goal is to be able to every year, starting in 2015, provide two bands each with an interest-free loan for $2,500, to get their music on the road. <br/></p>
<p>After completion of the funding, eligible bands can submit directly to Heavy Blog is Heavy. A selection committee, comprised of members of some well-known and diverse bands in the metal community will pick the top 10 bands from the submissions. Those top 10 will then be voted upon by Heavy Blog readers, and the top two will win the $2,500 grants.</p>
<p>To keep this project self-sustaining, the bands would then be required to return the money to Heavy Blog by March 1st of the following year, after which we would accept submissions again, and continue to allow two bands to tour, year after year!</p>
<p>Selection Committee, 2015:</p>
<p>John Matos (Abiotic)<br/>Sacha Dunable (Intronaut)<br/>Zach Dresher (Wings Denied)<br/>Eli Whitehead (Enfold Darkness)<br/>Dan Weiten (The Omega Experiment)<br/>Kyle Gaddo (Heavy Blog Is Heavy)<br/>Jordan Eberhardt (The Contortionist)<br/>Michael Rumple (Lorelei)<br/>Marty DePietro (Fivebyfive Records)<br/>TBD<br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why are you taking my money? <br/>
</h3>Goal- $6,500 USD<br/>Breakdown:<br/><ul>
<li>$5,000- to be used towards the grants. Two bands will each win amounts of $2,500. <br/>
</li>
<li>$1,500- Perk fulfillment. </li>
</ul>
<p>Stretch Goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>$9,000 USD- We'll add a third band! <br/>
</li>
<li>$12,000 USD- And a fourth band!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Why is this a good idea? <br/>
</h3> <ul> <li>Because touring is expensive! A typical three-week DIY tour can end up costing over a thousand dollars in gas expenses alone. Food expenses, between five people, even eating on $10-15 per day, can easily amount to around a thousand total as well. Not to mention the costs we all know, of pressing merch, purchasing quality gear, and maintaining/renting a van. <br/><br/>
</li>
<li>Because most importantly, we are a community, and this matters. Every single one of us writes or appreciates music, and this in turn makes us appreciate each other. The rest of society may not understand why we prefer a blast-beat or a breakdown to what's typically on the radio, but we do. We appreciate each other, we create art, and always want to help our friends. Many of us have hosted touring bands or bought them a drink, and all of us have gone to a show, with the hopes of meeting one of these people we admire. We're always willing to pay a few dollars for a Bandcamp album we particularly like, even if it's free. But by letting a band tour, we can take that support even further, and honestly make a difference in the world and community we've created. <br/>
</li>
</ul>

What’s
the biggest obstacle to any unsigned, unmanaged band trying to tour? Money,
100% of the time. When someone’s trying to go to college but can’t afford it,
what do they do? Apply for loans, scholarships, and other financial aid.
However, no such thing exists for metal bands. In the spirit of Brian Shields,
a man who always made it his priority to do whatever he could for bands, no
matter how small, we’re aiming to set up, in his honor, essentially a
“fund” for unsigned bands in the metal community.  With the support of heavyblogisheavy.com, if this crowd fund is successful, our goal is to be able to every year, starting in 2015, provide two bands each with an interest-free loan for $2,500, to get their music on the road. 
After completion of the funding, eligible bands can submit directly to Heavy Blog is Heavy. A selection committee, comprised of members of some well-known and diverse bands in the metal community will pick the top 10 bands from the submissions. Those top 10 will then be voted upon by Heavy Blog readers, and the top two will win the $2,500 grants.
To keep this project self-sustaining, the bands would then be required to return the money to Heavy Blog by March 1st of the following year, after which we would accept submissions again, and continue to allow two bands to tour, year after year!
Selection Committee, 2015:
John Matos (Abiotic)Sacha Dunable (Intronaut)Zach Dresher (Wings Denied)Eli Whitehead (Enfold Darkness)Dan Weiten (The Omega Experiment)Kyle Gaddo (Heavy Blog Is Heavy)Jordan Eberhardt (The Contortionist)Michael Rumple (Lorelei)Marty DePietro (Fivebyfive Records)TBD

Why are you taking my money? 
Goal- $6,500 USDBreakdown:
$5,000- to be used towards the grants. Two bands will each win amounts of $2,500. 

$1,500- Perk fulfillment. 

Stretch Goals:

$9,000 USD- We'll add a third band! 

$12,000 USD- And a fourth band!



  Why is this a good idea? 
  Because touring is expensive! A typical three-week DIY tour can end up costing over a thousand dollars in gas expenses alone. Food expenses, between five people, even eating on $10-15 per day, can easily amount to around a thousand total as well. Not to mention the costs we all know, of pressing merch, purchasing quality gear, and maintaining/renting a van. 

Because most importantly, we are a community, and this matters. Every single one of us writes or appreciates music, and this in turn makes us appreciate each other. The rest of society may not understand why we prefer a blast-beat or a breakdown to what's typically on the radio, but we do. We appreciate each other, we create art, and always want to help our friends. Many of us have hosted touring bands or bought them a drink, and all of us have gone to a show, with the hopes of meeting one of these people we admire. We're always willing to pay a few dollars for a Bandcamp album we particularly like, even if it's free. But by letting a band tour, we can take that support even further, and honestly make a difference in the world and community we've created. 



What do these shirts look like?
We're glad you asked. We've commissioned designer Mike Graziano, to create the following shirts:
""Dabs in Heaven:""


And, ""This Shirt Helped a Band Tour""




   I'm Broke. What can I do? 
  Help share this crowdfund! Every voice can reach a new donor.
 Go to your local DIY show! Every dollar that goes towards an unsigned band on tour is a dollar well spent. 

   I claimed a perk, and I have questions?

IF THE PERK YOU HAVE CLAIMED ISN'T SHOWING UP ON THE SIDE ANYMORE: Don't worry, we've got it. Indiegogo only lets us show 20 at a time, and we've had some pretty generous people that have offered things to this campaign. Everyone who selected a perk that has sold out (Contortionist shirts, posters, and Eli's guest solos) will receive that perk.
If you have selected ANY sort of shirt option, you will receive an email AFTER the completion of the crowdfunding, where we'll get your shirt size, and confirm the shipping address.

<h3>¡Hola!</h3> <p></p>
<p>Me llamo Anamari, vivo en Santurtzi, Bizkaia (España). </p>
<p>Amo a
Dios y amo la música, la música es parte fundamental de la adoración a Dios en
la Iglesia y Dios ha querido en su misericordia que yo pueda servirle con la
Alabanza y la Adoración. En todos estos años, con una simple guitarra, Dios me
ha dado muchas canciones que han sido de gran bendición en su Iglesia. </p>
<p>Empecé a componer con solo 15 años y hasta el día de hoy Dios sigue siendo fiel y sigue dándome canciones, que nacen estando en su presencia y en comunión con su Espíritu Santo.</p>
<h3><b>¿Por qué quiero grabar un disco de alabanza?</b></h3>
<p>¡Ha llegado el momento de compartir ese don con todos
vosotros! Mi humilde anhelo siempre ha sido haceros participes de este llamado
y que su bendición se extienda y pueda sobrepasar el ámbito de nuestra iglesia
local y nuestra pequeña zona de influencia. </p>
<p>Que este proyecto sea una herramienta al servicio del pueblo
de Dios en España, para que otros puedan adorarle y ser bendecidos por Él como
nosotros.</p>
<p>Es una respuesta a tantos hermanos y amigos que siempre han
insistido y me han animado:</p>

Me llamo Anamari, vivo en Santurtzi, Bizkaia (España). 
Amo a
Dios y amo la música, la música es parte fundamental de la adoración a Dios en
la Iglesia y Dios ha querido en su misericordia que yo pueda servirle con la
Alabanza y la Adoración. En todos estos años, con una simple guitarra, Dios me
ha dado muchas canciones que han sido de gran bendición en su Iglesia. 
Empecé a componer con solo 15 años y hasta el día de hoy Dios sigue siendo fiel y sigue dándome canciones, que nacen estando en su presencia y en comunión con su Espíritu Santo.
¿Por qué quiero grabar un disco de alabanza?
¡Ha llegado el momento de compartir ese don con todos
vosotros! Mi humilde anhelo siempre ha sido haceros participes de este llamado
y que su bendición se extienda y pueda sobrepasar el ámbito de nuestra iglesia
local y nuestra pequeña zona de influencia. 
Que este proyecto sea una herramienta al servicio del pueblo
de Dios en España, para que otros puedan adorarle y ser bendecidos por Él como
nosotros.
Es una respuesta a tantos hermanos y amigos que siempre han
insistido y me han animado:
      —Ana,
¡tienes que grabar un disco con tus canciones!



¿Por qué ahora?
En febrero de 2015
conocimos a Ana Mary Baizán y David Neutel, líderes de alabanza en una de las
iglesias más grandes de Lisboa. David es productor musical con mucha
experiencia y, después de visitar su estudio en marzo, vimos claro que es con el con
quien debíamos realizarlo.
Lo que necesitamos y lo que obtienes 
Necesitamos 4000$
para cubrir una gran parte de estos gastos:




El trabajo del productor musical.


Los músicos de estudio.


El diseño gráfico, impresión y duplicación
del disco físico.


Los viajes a Lisboa para la grabación de las
voces.


Esta web está pensada para que puedas ayudarme en la financiación del proyecto
y con tu aportación podrás recibir lo que llaman una ""recompensa"" que puede ser:



Descarga
de una de las canciones.


Descarga
completa del disco.


Un disco
físico.


Una
visita a tu iglesia ¡con concierto de alabanza incluido!

I know that it was important for me to come back to Michigan. Why was it important? </strong></p><p><strong>  I’ll answer that question now. First let me start by saying it was never my intention to move back to Michigan ever again in my life. When I left Houston, Tx, I was in a bad place mentally. After first going through heart ache and still living with the person who tore my heart and soul to pieces. I was already pretty unstable mentally. I was ready to give up on life. I didn’t know how much more I could handle, after everything I had already been through in my life. Six months of heart break, cutting and uncontrolled drinking and pot smoking went by …</strong></p><p><strong>  July 27, 2010 I was 2 hours away from going home on my first day at a new job. My cell phone started going crazy with text messages and my facebook was also lit up with messages and comments to contact almost every person I am related to back in Michigan. As I stated it was my first day back to work after being without a job for almost 3 months. So, I was trying to get my life back together. Back to the text messages and facebook messages I was receiving to contact my family in Michigan.  No one wanted to tell me through a text message or a facebook message what was going on. I called my Aunt Patti to find out everything, thats when my world completely crumbled. She told me they weren’t sure, but that my cousin had seen on the news that a 50 year old woman was found murdered in my moms home. My mom was 50, the only woman that lived in that home. So i did what most people would do, and i started searching the internet for stories about what had happened. I knew it was her, but still had some hope that it wasn’t. When I found a posting on a local Flint, Mich. news website, it included a photo of my moms house. Not a picture of her, not her name… but that is when I knew. My mom was gone. I lost it. I cried… and cried and cried. I got into my car and drove to the first person I knew I could count on to be there for me. My ex Jennifer. I cried as I drove to her job. Screaming and yelling at other drivers, speeding like a bat out of hell. When I arrived at her job, i waited in the car for her to come out. When she came out… I ran into her arms and collapsed. </strong></p><p><strong>I never thought I would lose my mother that way. I never though a lot of things. I never knew that my mom had an addiction to crack cocaine. I was so caught up in my heart being broken that I lost all connection with my family. I was so caught up in the love I though I had that I forgot about what should have been more important to me. </strong></p><p><strong>My mother and I always had a very rocky relationship, but I loved her more then anything. She is my mother, how could I not love her. She gave up a lot for me. Regardless of all the pain I had locked up inside from her going to prison, I still loved her very much. Regardless of the ridiculous arguments we had, and the months we would go without speaking to each other, she was still my biggest fan. No matter what wrong I had done in my life she was always there for me and I for her. </strong></p><p><strong>I flew to Michigan the day after finding out my mom was murdered. It was all so surreal. I felt like I was in my own episode of the first 48 or some other reality murder investigation show. As soon as I got off the plane, I saw my dad and wanted to cry. But I held it together. I promised myself that I wouldn’t lose it, I would keep my shit together and stay strong. I promised myself I wouldn’t let anyone see me cry or seem weak. And that is exactly what I did. </strong></p><p><strong>When I went to my moms house to meet detectives and clean it out, I didn’t want to go in. I didn’t want to see my mothers murder scene. Everyone that came with me: my dad, his wife, Aunt Sandy, Aunt Katie, Aunt Toni and Uncle Ted, they all told me I had to go in. I had to tell them what I wanted to take and what I didn’t. They got me to go into the house, I wish I never had done that. The images still stick in my mind. To see my mothers home in shambles, dirty and disorganized. It was so crazy to me. She was such a clean person, OCD practically. She was always cleaning, everything was always spotless. To see her mattress on the front lawn, soaked in her blood,  her blood splattered on the walls in the bedroom from the two shots fired into her head. To find crack pipe upon crack pipe in drawer upon drawer and shuffling through a mess I never thought my mom would make, was like being in a movie. This is stuff you see in movies right? </strong></p><p><strong>I planned her memorial service and had her buried with my grandmother. I knew that is what she would have wanted. Through it all I didn’t break, I kept my composure. I didn’t cry, I didn’t show weakness and I held it together. I couldn’t let my family see me break. After two weeks of being in Michigan with my family I was ready to go home, to get back to my life and try to recover from everything had happened. Once I got home, I went back to drinking and smoking pot just to keep from feeling the pain I had inside. I just wanted to be numb. I would spend days in my room… sleepless and crying. I would go out nights and drink and smoke and drink and smoke. Anything to feel numb… I didn’t want to feel anything at all. I just wanted to die. One night I found a bottle of Vicodin of my Ex-Girlfriends in the apartment we both still lived in. I decided this was it. This was the time for me to end it all. No more pain, no more drinking and smoking pot to feel numb. No more. I was done living. I was done. I grabbed the first alcoholic beverage I could find, I don’t remember now what it was. And one pill at a time I took with a shot of liquor. Locked in my bathroom I took pill after pill. Waiting for it all to end. I sat on the bathroom floor, thinking about all the good I had in my life before. I had found love and lost love although dysfunctional I had a good family. I was ready to say good-bye. I grabbed the pen and paper i had on the counter and as I sat on the floor in a numb haze, I wrote. </strong></p><p><strong>  I am not sorry. I wanted it this way. I can’t deal with life anymore. Don’t cry for me, I am not worth anyone’s tears. </strong></p><p><strong>    Love, </strong></p><p><strong>    Nebula</strong></p><p><strong>I remember laying on the floor the room spinning and everything looking blurry, fading in and out of consciousness. I laid there and waited for my end as My ipod played music in the background. I felt that the end was coming closer and closer. Then this song came on by Framing Hanley called Hear me Now. I listened to the words… and something in me made me get up off the floor. I sat in front of the toilet as I heard the words “Now my body’s on the floor and I am calling, Well I’m Calling out to you, Can you hear me now?” </strong></p><p><strong>  I shoved my finger down my throat, and forced the poison out of me. I forced myself to keep on living. </strong></p><p><strong>  Not long after I attempted to take my life, I decided I needed to go home. I needed to be with my family, and to be with people that Love me. I had nothing left in Houston. I had nothing. I needed to get myself back… re-identify myself. I needed to get “Nebula” back. So, I packed up my car with what ever I could fit, sold the belongings that didn’t and as my apartment slowly became empty I cried. I knew this was the end of what I thought was the life I wanted for myself. This was good-bye to what I had come to love and a real final good-bye to the breaker of my heart. </strong></p><p><strong> Now… Here I am in Michigan. Miserably cold and constantly bored. But I have grown. Thankful for everyday I have on this earth and thankful for that song. Thankful to a song that kept me wanting to live. I have completely re-identified, happier now then I have ever been. Granted, I miss my mother more then anything. And I know she watches me, making sure I’m not fucking up. Making sure I’m not numbing myself anymore. I have so much to be thankful for and so much to live for. I am blessed for everyday I have and I work hard to fulfill my every dream, no matter what it takes. </strong></p><br/></div>","I’m sitting here in my room…Bored out of my mind, and just thinking.

If you're not able to make a financial contribution please share the www.countindigo.net link and help spread the word. I'll be keeping you in very regular touch with how the kidnap is going and what you can do to save H.M. and get the project afloat.With your help, one recording can revitalise 2015's turgid notions of Britishness into something far more dangerous, danceable and fun!Be lovely, H.M.is depending on it.Cordial regards,The Count.",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

<div>The sum we are seeking is 800 CAD. It might seem low but this is due to the fact that we are going to record in Samara where fees aren't as high as in Europe or Canada.

<h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>Hi, everybody. I am Carol Mossa, a 60-year-old author and adventurer from East Greenwich, Rhode Island. My forthcoming book, <i>Linger Longer: Lessons from a Contemplative Life, (Brown Books Publishing Group), </i>is the result of a 30-day, solo, cross-country trip that I took last October. Armed with my camera, a few changes of clothes, and a dream to see the United States through a contemplative lens, I traveled 9500 miles, slept in nineteen different <i>Airbnb</i> properties, and found vast storehouses of courage and creativity that changed the way I occupy the world daily. My journey captured the hearts and minds of people nationwide as I photographed, blogged, and videotaped my way across the country and back (social media is a wonderful thing). Women asked me publicly and privately, ""How did you become so fearless?"" All I can say is, ""I became fearless by practicing fear less."" This summer I am hitting the open road again, and I am offering women artists, writers, poets, photographers, musicians---seekers---a chance to cast aside fear, excuses, and trepidation. Ladies, hitch your stars to MY WAGON. I purchased a new 2014 Ford Transit Connect wagon which seats seven passengers including myself. I will leave the East Coast on, or about, June 26 and return on, or about, September 30. My itinerary is loosely planned, but I anticipate traveling at least 13,000 miles, coast-to-coast, door-to-door. Join me. Let me show you how to travel with less baggage, expectations, and preconceived notions. Come explore. Bring your paints, your camera, your pens and paper, your desire to experience spontaneity, and to <i>linger longer </i>over things that matter today and every day. Bring your heart. I promise to take good care of it. </p>

<p>Today, I'm on IndieGoGo to raise funds for the completion and promotion of my upcoming EP entitled Mood Indigo along with a music video for it's main single ""California Girls"".</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Some background info on California Girls: Like most recordings - it started in my bedroom around 2 AM one night, with a simple guitar lick, just an idea at this point. I worked with minimal equipment, but somehow managed to mix the song to a point at which it was digestible enough for the online community. Fast forward 4 months, I released it on Soundcloud and could've never anticipated the tremendous success it's had so far: reaching #1 on Hype Machine AND 22Tracks for three whole days, beating off huge artists like Kendrick Lamar &amp; Bruno Mars! Not just that, but it generated over 200,000 plays in less than 3 weeks and even gets international radio play now!!! </p>

<p>Making quality music and visuals can get quite

<span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Ever since childhood, I've dreamt of being bea</span><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">med from one place to another just like in Star Trek: momentarily, magically whisked into an alternate reality.</span></p>
<p>
<span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">It took me a while to understand that this is impossible right now, and probably not in my </span><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">lifetime. However, this sensation of suddenly transcending to a parallel reality and level of consciousness magically happens in music.</span></p>
<p>
<span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">This is what drives me: to help people shift their perception and their reality... away from the mundane, the everyday... and towards the surreal, the sublime... to a spot that connects you to the beauty of life.</span></p>

<p>
		 </p>
<p>
<span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">As a musician, I'm fulfilling my biggest dream - to tour with my band between countries &amp; across continents, and to host many audiences in my ""Transporter deck"" at different clubs or festivals.</span></p>
<p>
<span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Today, after working with the same team for nearly 3 years, we feel the urge to document these journeys, and we will be humbled by your support which will enable us to do so. </span></p>
<p>
<span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">We will do our best so that the recordings will also beam you up in a spin of a CD!</span></p>

		Pledge Today!</h1>
<p>
<span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">To the right, you will find various ways to help us achieve our goal of raising 7400€ for our project. </span></p>
<p>
<span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">This amount will allow us the basic product and with your extra support we can finance many more things that will really beam us up!</span></p>

<p>
<span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">The contributions will be invested in:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Recording studio &amp; engineer in Meudon, France (~2000€) </strong>- To produce the highest quality recording, one needs to use the most reliable engineer, equipment and facility, Studio de Meudon has that reputation and has recorded albums by notables such as Avishai Cohen, Archie Shepp, Bireli Legrene &amp; Johnny Halliday among many others. </span>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Mixing of the album (~1500€)</strong> - </span><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">after the long days of recording, we start the mixing. Usually between an hour and 2 hours are spent on each track on average. This attention to detail is critical in order to create the most authentic, rich listening experience for you.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Graphic design &amp; photography</strong> (~750€) - a big part of today's showbiz is about the image. Creating the right visuals always help to promote what important - the music. I'll be working with photographer <a href=""http://www.nicolas-vernier.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Nicolas Vernier</a>, a well known jazz portrait &amp; film-scenes photographer in France.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><strong>Public relations &amp; press campaign in France (~3000€)</strong> - </span><span style=""font-size: 16px;"">Since this project is going to be distributed either by a label (there are few already interested now!) or be self released (in case we can't find the right label), we made sure to keep enough budget aside for a good PR campaign which, except for the music, is the most essential part of releasing a production.</span>

		Stretch Goals</h1>
<p>
		In case the project is reaching its goal please don't stop pledging, with your help we can do those things (in addition to the basic) that will get us to the next level:</p>
<p>
		 </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>The 10,000€ Goal </strong>will allow us to <b>launch a Radio PR campaign in Europe</b> which has a the potential to significantly impact the success of this project. We would also <b>create a video</b> for our EPK (electronic press kit). Having a high-quality video is <i>the most important element</i> of our EPK which is what we use for booking our showcases and tours around the world!</li>
<li>
<strong>The 14,000€ Goal </strong>will <b>finance a showcase</b> in one of the Jazz expos in the USA or Europe (such as APAP, SXSW, JazzAhead, Womex). Investing in these showcases gives us critical access to networking opportunities in the industry and allows us to develop the relationships that we need to have to <i>continue forward and maintain momentum.</i>
</li>
<li>
<strong>The 20,000€ Goal...</strong> would knock our socks off! We would invest the additional amounts in <b>1) launching a PR campaign in the USA and 2) filming a super-professional video clip</b> that we would use in our promotional efforts. These 2 investments would lend crucial efforts to our work in the International scene <i>as well as</i> strengthen our assets for use in France and Europe. After the music itself, a quality, professional music video is the next most important asset to have in place for promoting our music and having the ability to launch an effective PR campaign.<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> </span>

<h1>
		The Team</h1>
<p>
<span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Since coming to France I had the pleasure of meeting the best musicians on the scene, I'm really proud to share the stage with these guys:</span></p>
<p>
<strong><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Paul Lay - Piano </span></strong></p>
<p>
<span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><img alt=""team"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.shaulieinav.com/images/team.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin-left: 10px; float: right;""/></span></p>
<p>
<span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">I met Paul during a random session that was organized about a month after my arrival to France, </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; font-size: 10pt; background-color: initial;"">usually it takes time to find bandmates but sometimes random things lead you to the best decisions. Besides being the most musically-generous pianist I played with, </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; font-size: 10pt; background-color: initial;"">Paul Lay “Mikado” ” (ミカド (ゲーム)) Quartet, just won in Paris the prestigious Prize of Charles Cros Academy, for the best international jazz album of the year.</span></p>
<p>
<span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">This is what jazz legend Martial Solal had to say about him:</span></p>
<p>
<cite><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">“Excellent harmonic imagination, diverse playing, most interesting compositions, and obvious knowledge of jazz history as well as a personal voice: Paul Lay has got everything it takes to go right to the top and make a lasting career”</span></cite></p>
<p>
<strong><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Florent Nisse - Contrabass</span></strong></p>
<p>
<span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">Recently after settling in Paris, I kept hearing this name ""Florenisse"" going on, I was sure that whoever he is, he must be something else for not needing a last name. </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; font-size: 10pt; background-color: initial;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">Something like ""Ronaldo"" in Soccer or ""Dr. J"" in basketball</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">.</span></span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; font-size: 10pt; background-color: initial;"">. </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; font-size: 10pt; background-color: initial;"">Florent is one of the best bassist I ever played with, his rhythmic feeling adds another layer to the drums and his big sound is helping the piano to extends its lower register. </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; font-size: 10pt; background-color: initial;"">His has been the most supportive cat on the scene and I'm really fortunate to have him around.</span></p>
<p>
<strong><span style=""font-size: 12pt;"">Gautier Garrigue - Drums</span></strong></p>
<p>
<span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">Gautier is one of the bussiest drummers in France and his career led him to play on important stages all over the world such as North Sea Jazz Festival, Venezia Jazz Festival, Jazz à Vienne, Jazz in Marciac, Victoria jazz festival, Vancouver jazz festival, Belgrade Jazz festival. Like me</span><span style=""font-size: 10pt;"">, Gautier arrived from distance to Paris (born in Parpignan in the south west of France right next to Spain), despite of his young age, you can hear his personal and musical maturity in every gesture on the drums.</span></p>

<p>
	Depuis que je suis enfant, je rêve de me téléporter d’un endroit à un autre comme dans Star Trek : être emmené temporairement dans une réalité parallèle comme par magie. </p>
<p>
	Il m’a fallu du temps pour comprendre que c’était finalement impossible et que ce serait probablement toujours le cas de mon vivant. Néanmoins, cette sensation de dépasser soudainement les limites, pour atteindre une réalité et un niveau de conscience parallèles, s’opère comme par enchantement grâce à la musique.</p>
<p>
	C’est ce qui me porte : aider les gens à changer leur vision des choses et leur quotidien … loin du terre-à-terre, du train-train… et s’envoler vers le surréel et le sublime vers un endroit qui vous rapproche de la beauté de la vie.</p>
<p>
	 </p>
<h1>
	Qu'est-ce que le projet « Beam me up » ?</h1>
<p>
	En étant musicien, j’ai pu réaliser mon plus grand rêve : partir en tournée avec mon groupe à travers les pays et les continents et accueillir le public sur ma « rampe de lancement » dans différents clubs et festivals.</p>
<p>
	Aujourd’hui, après avoir travaillé ensemble pendant près de 3 ans, nous ressentons le besoin de partager ces voyages et nous serons émus par votre soutien qui pourra nous permettre de l’assouvir.   </p>
<p>
	 Nous ferons de notre mieux pour que notre album vous téléporte aussi en un tour de CD!</p>
<p>
	 </p>
<h1>
	Participez dès aujourd’hui !</h1>
<p>
	A votre droite, vous trouverez différentes façons de nous aider à atteindre notre objectif de 7400€ pour notre projet.</p>
<p>
	Cette somme d’argent nous permettra de réaliser la base du projet, et, avec votre soutien supplémentaire, nous pouvons financer encore bien des choses qui pourront vraiment nous faire rêver !</p>
<p>
<b>Les dons seront investis dans :</b></p>
<p><b>
	1- Le studio d’enregistrement et son personnel à Meudon (~2000€)</b> : Pour réaliser un enregistrement de la meilleure qualité qui soit, nous avons besoin du personnel, de l’équipement et des locaux les plus fiables. Le studio de Meudon remplit tous ces critères et des personnes de renom telles que Avishai Cohen, Archie Shepp, Bireli Legren, Johnny Halliday et encore bien d’autres y ont enregistré leurs albums.</p>
<p><b>
	2- Mixage de l’album (~1500€) </b>: Après plusieurs jours d’enregistrement, nous commençons le mixage. Environ une ou deux heures sont consacrées à chaque chanson. Cette attention portée au détail est primordiale pour vous offrir l’expérience d’écoute la plus riche et la plus authentique.   </p>
<p><b>
	3 – Création graphique et photos (~750 €)</b> : dans le monde du spectacle, l’image a aujourd’hui une place très importante. Trouver LES photos aide toujours à promouvoir ce qui est important : la musique. Je vais travailler avec Nicolas Vernier,  photographe reconnu dans le monde du jazz en France pour ses portraits et ses photos de cinéma. </p>
<p><b>
	4 – Relations publiques et campagne de presse en France (~3000€) </b>: Comme ce projet va se voir distribué soit par un label (certains sont désormais intéressés !) ou par nous-mêmes (si nous ne trouvons pas le bon label), nous voulons être sûrs d’avoir assez d’argent de côté pour une campagne de communication de qualité qui, en dehors de la musique, est la partie la plus importante dans le processus de production.</p>
<h1>
	Les récompenses</h1>
<p>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">A votre droite vous pouvez trouver un panel de récompenses que je souhaite vous donner comme marque de reconnaissance pour votre générosité et votre soutien. N’hésitez pas à choisir celui qui vous plaît le plus ! </span></p>

	 </h1>
<h1>
	Dépasser les objectifs</h1>
<p>
	Si nous avons atteint notre objectif, n’hésitez pas à continuer de donner ! Avec votre aide nous pourrions faire ce qui suit (en plus du projet de base) pour passer au niveau supérieur :</p>
<p>
	- Atteindre les 10 000€, nous permettrait de lancer une campagne de radio en Europe, ce qui aurait un impact significatif pour la réussite de ce projet. Nous créerions également une vidéo pour notre DPE (dossier de presse électronique). Une vidéo de haute qualité est ce qu’il y a de plus important pour notre DPE, car nous nous servons de cet outil pour signer des contrats de showcases et partir en tournée à travers le monde entier.</p>
<p>
	- Atteindre les 14 000€ permettrait de financer un showcase dans un des festivals de jazz des Etats-Unis ou d’Europe, tels que l’APAP, le SXSW, le JazzAhead ou encore le Womex. Investir dans ces événements nous donne un accès primordial pour des possibilités de/serait une porte ouverte pour créer des réseaux dans ce milieu et nous permettrait d’établir les contacts nécessaires pour continuer sur notre lancée.</p>
<p>
	- Atteindre les 20 000€ … nous laisserait sans voix ! On investirait ces dons supplémentaires dans 1) le lancement d’une campagne de communication aux Etats-Unis et 2) le tournage professionnel d’un clip vidéo que nous utiliserions pour les campagnes promotionnelles. Non seulement ces deux investissements mèneraient à des efforts importants sur notre travail concernant la scène internationale, mais ils renforceraient notre budget pour la France et l’Europe. Après la musique en tant que telle, un clip vidéo professionnel et de qualité est l’autre chose la plus importante à avoir pour pouvoir promouvoir notre musique et être capable de lancer une campagne de communication efficace.</p>
<h1>
	L’équipe</h1>
<p>
	Depuis mon arrivée en France, j’ai eu le plaisir de rencontrer les meilleurs musiciens, et je suis vraiment très fier de pouvoir partager la scène avec eux :</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Paul Lay - Piano</span></p><p>
<span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><img alt=""team"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.shaulieinav.com/images/team.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin-left: 10px; float: right;""/></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">J’ai rencontré Paul au hasard lors d’une session organisée environ un mois après mon arrivée en France. D’habitude, dénicher des partenaires de scène prend du temps, mais des fois le hasard vous fait prendre les meilleures décisions. En plus d’être le meilleur pianiste avec qui j’ai jamais joué, son quartet Paul Lay « Mikado » ” (ミカド (ゲーム) venait tout juste de remporter à Paris le prestigieux prix de l’Académie Charles Cros dans la catégorie meilleur album jazz international de l’année. Voici ce que la légende du jazz Martial Solal dit de lui :</span><br/></p>
<p>
	« Excellente imagination harmonique, jeu très diversité, compositions des plus intéressantes, connaissance évidente de l’histoire du jazz, discours personnel : Paul Lay a tous les atouts pour monter et durer ! »</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">Florent Nisse - Contrebasse</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Peu de temps après mon installation à Paris, lorsque j’ai entendu le nom « Florenisse », je pensais que c’était un nom de scène, comme ça peut être le cas pour Ronaldo au football ou Dr. J au basketball, et qu’il n’avait donc pas besoin de donner son nom de famille pour qu’on sache que c’est lui. Florent est l’un des meilleurs contrebassistes avec qui j’ai pu joué. Son ressenti du rythme rajoute une autre couche à la batterie et son gros son aide le piano à élargir ses graves. Il a été le gars faisant preuve du plus grand engagement sur scène et j’ai vraiment beaucoup de chance de l’avoir à mes côtés. </span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">Gautier Garrigue - Batterie</span><br/></p>
<p>
	Gautier est l’un des batteurs les plus actifs en France, et sa carrière l’a mené à jouer dans le monde entier sur des grandes scènes telles que le North Sea Festival, le Venezia Jazz Festival, Jazz à Vienne, Jazz in Marciac, le Victoria Jazz Festival, le Vancouver Jazz Festival. Tout comme moi, Gautier habitait loin de Paris avant de venir s’y installer puisqu’il est né à Perpignan, dans le Sud-Ouest de la France. Malgré son jeune âge, vous pouvez entendre sa maturité, aussi bien personnelle que musicale, dans chacun de ses coups de batterie. </p>

	The Mission




Ever since childhood, I've dreamt of being beamed from one place to another just like in Star Trek: momentarily, magically whisked into an alternate reality.

It took me a while to understand that this is impossible right now, and probably not in my lifetime. However, this sensation of suddenly transcending to a parallel reality and level of consciousness magically happens in music.

This is what drives me: to help people shift their perception and their reality... away from the mundane, the everyday... and towards the surreal, the sublime... to a spot that connects you to the beauty of life.

		 

		About the ""Beam Me Up"" Project

		 

As a musician, I'm fulfilling my biggest dream - to tour with my band between countries & across continents, and to host many audiences in my ""Transporter deck"" at different clubs or festivals.

Today, after working with the same team for nearly 3 years, we feel the urge to document these journeys, and we will be humbled by your support which will enable us to do so. 

We will do our best so that the recordings will also beam you up in a spin of a CD!

		Pledge Today!

To the right, you will find various ways to help us achieve our goal of raising 7400€ for our project. 

This amount will allow us the basic product and with your extra support we can finance many more things that will really beam us up!



The contributions will be invested in:


Recording studio & engineer in Meudon, France (~2000€) - To produce the highest quality recording, one needs to use the most reliable engineer, equipment and facility, Studio de Meudon has that reputation and has recorded albums by notables such as Avishai Cohen, Archie Shepp, Bireli Legrene & Johnny Halliday among many others. 


Mixing of the album (~1500€) - after the long days of recording, we start the mixing. Usually between an hour and 2 hours are spent on each track on average. This attention to detail is critical in order to create the most authentic, rich listening experience for you.


Graphic design & photography (~750€) - a big part of today's showbiz is about the image. Creating the right visuals always help to promote what important - the music. I'll be working with photographer Nicolas Vernier, a well known jazz portrait & film-scenes photographer in France.


Public relations & press campaign in France (~3000€) - Since this project is going to be distributed either by a label (there are few already interested now!) or be self released (in case we can't find the right label), we made sure to keep enough budget aside for a good PR campaign which, except for the music, is the most essential part of releasing a production.




			The Rewards

			On the right side you can find a variety of rewards that I want to give you as a token of appreciation for your generosity and support. Please choose the one that fits you best.

		Stretch Goals

		In case the project is reaching its goal please don't stop pledging, with your help we can do those things (in addition to the basic) that will get us to the next level:

		 


The 10,000€ Goal will allow us to launch a Radio PR campaign in Europe which has a the potential to significantly impact the success of this project. We would also create a video for our EPK (electronic press kit). Having a high-quality video is the most important element of our EPK which is what we use for booking our showcases and tours around the world!

The 14,000€ Goal will finance a showcase in one of the Jazz expos in the USA or Europe (such as APAP, SXSW, JazzAhead, Womex). Investing in these showcases gives us critical access to networking opportunities in the industry and allows us to develop the relationships that we need to have to continue forward and maintain momentum.


The 20,000€ Goal... would knock our socks off! We would invest the additional amounts in 1) launching a PR campaign in the USA and 2) filming a super-professional video clip that we would use in our promotional efforts. These 2 investments would lend crucial efforts to our work in the International scene as well as strengthen our assets for use in France and Europe. After the music itself, a quality, professional music video is the next most important asset to have in place for promoting our music and having the ability to launch an effective PR campaign. 



		The Team

Since coming to France I had the pleasure of meeting the best musicians on the scene, I'm really proud to share the stage with these guys:

Paul Lay - Piano 



I met Paul during a random session that was organized about a month after my arrival to France, usually it takes time to find bandmates but sometimes random things lead you to the best decisions. Besides being the most musically-generous pianist I played with, Paul Lay “Mikado” ” (ミカド (ゲーム)) Quartet, just won in Paris the prestigious Prize of Charles Cros Academy, for the best international jazz album of the year.

This is what jazz legend Martial Solal had to say about him:

“Excellent harmonic imagination, diverse playing, most interesting compositions, and obvious knowledge of jazz history as well as a personal voice: Paul Lay has got everything it takes to go right to the top and make a lasting career”

Florent Nisse - Contrabass

Recently after settling in Paris, I kept hearing this name ""Florenisse"" going on, I was sure that whoever he is, he must be something else for not needing a last name. Something like ""Ronaldo"" in Soccer or ""Dr. J"" in basketball.. Florent is one of the best bassist I ever played with, his rhythmic feeling adds another layer to the drums and his big sound is helping the piano to extends its lower register. His has been the most supportive cat on the scene and I'm really fortunate to have him around.

Gautier Garrigue - Drums

Gautier is one of the bussiest drummers in France and his career led him to play on important stages all over the world such as North Sea Jazz Festival, Venezia Jazz Festival, Jazz à Vienne, Jazz in Marciac, Victoria jazz festival, Vancouver jazz festival, Belgrade Jazz festival. Like me, Gautier arrived from distance to Paris (born in Parpignan in the south west of France right next to Spain), despite of his young age, you can hear his personal and musical maturity in every gesture on the drums.

	La Mission





	Depuis que je suis enfant, je rêve de me téléporter d’un endroit à un autre comme dans Star Trek : être emmené temporairement dans une réalité parallèle comme par magie. 

	Il m’a fallu du temps pour comprendre que c’était finalement impossible et que ce serait probablement toujours le cas de mon vivant. Néanmoins, cette sensation de dépasser soudainement les limites, pour atteindre une réalité et un niveau de conscience parallèles, s’opère comme par enchantement grâce à la musique.

	C’est ce qui me porte : aider les gens à changer leur vision des choses et leur quotidien … loin du terre-à-terre, du train-train… et s’envoler vers le surréel et le sublime vers un endroit qui vous rapproche de la beauté de la vie.

	 

	Qu'est-ce que le projet « Beam me up » ?

	En étant musicien, j’ai pu réaliser mon plus grand rêve : partir en tournée avec mon groupe à travers les pays et les continents et accueillir le public sur ma « rampe de lancement » dans différents clubs et festivals.

	Aujourd’hui, après avoir travaillé ensemble pendant près de 3 ans, nous ressentons le besoin de partager ces voyages et nous serons émus par votre soutien qui pourra nous permettre de l’assouvir.   

	 Nous ferons de notre mieux pour que notre album vous téléporte aussi en un tour de CD!

	 

	Participez dès aujourd’hui !

	A votre droite, vous trouverez différentes façons de nous aider à atteindre notre objectif de 7400€ pour notre projet.

	Cette somme d’argent nous permettra de réaliser la base du projet, et, avec votre soutien supplémentaire, nous pouvons financer encore bien des choses qui pourront vraiment nous faire rêver !

Les dons seront investis dans :

	1- Le studio d’enregistrement et son personnel à Meudon (~2000€) : Pour réaliser un enregistrement de la meilleure qualité qui soit, nous avons besoin du personnel, de l’équipement et des locaux les plus fiables. Le studio de Meudon remplit tous ces critères et des personnes de renom telles que Avishai Cohen, Archie Shepp, Bireli Legren, Johnny Halliday et encore bien d’autres y ont enregistré leurs albums.

	2- Mixage de l’album (~1500€) : Après plusieurs jours d’enregistrement, nous commençons le mixage. Environ une ou deux heures sont consacrées à chaque chanson. Cette attention portée au détail est primordiale pour vous offrir l’expérience d’écoute la plus riche et la plus authentique.   

	3 – Création graphique et photos (~750 €) : dans le monde du spectacle, l’image a aujourd’hui une place très importante. Trouver LES photos aide toujours à promouvoir ce qui est important : la musique. Je vais travailler avec Nicolas Vernier,  photographe reconnu dans le monde du jazz en France pour ses portraits et ses photos de cinéma. 

	4 – Relations publiques et campagne de presse en France (~3000€) : Comme ce projet va se voir distribué soit par un label (certains sont désormais intéressés !) ou par nous-mêmes (si nous ne trouvons pas le bon label), nous voulons être sûrs d’avoir assez d’argent de côté pour une campagne de communication de qualité qui, en dehors de la musique, est la partie la plus importante dans le processus de production.

	Les récompenses

A votre droite vous pouvez trouver un panel de récompenses que je souhaite vous donner comme marque de reconnaissance pour votre générosité et votre soutien. N’hésitez pas à choisir celui qui vous plaît le plus ! 

Cliquez sur l'image ou télécharger en PDF



	 

	Dépasser les objectifs

	Si nous avons atteint notre objectif, n’hésitez pas à continuer de donner ! Avec votre aide nous pourrions faire ce qui suit (en plus du projet de base) pour passer au niveau supérieur :

	- Atteindre les 10 000€, nous permettrait de lancer une campagne de radio en Europe, ce qui aurait un impact significatif pour la réussite de ce projet. Nous créerions également une vidéo pour notre DPE (dossier de presse électronique). Une vidéo de haute qualité est ce qu’il y a de plus important pour notre DPE, car nous nous servons de cet outil pour signer des contrats de showcases et partir en tournée à travers le monde entier.

	- Atteindre les 14 000€ permettrait de financer un showcase dans un des festivals de jazz des Etats-Unis ou d’Europe, tels que l’APAP, le SXSW, le JazzAhead ou encore le Womex. Investir dans ces événements nous donne un accès primordial pour des possibilités de/serait une porte ouverte pour créer des réseaux dans ce milieu et nous permettrait d’établir les contacts nécessaires pour continuer sur notre lancée.

	- Atteindre les 20 000€ … nous laisserait sans voix ! On investirait ces dons supplémentaires dans 1) le lancement d’une campagne de communication aux Etats-Unis et 2) le tournage professionnel d’un clip vidéo que nous utiliserions pour les campagnes promotionnelles. Non seulement ces deux investissements mèneraient à des efforts importants sur notre travail concernant la scène internationale, mais ils renforceraient notre budget pour la France et l’Europe. Après la musique en tant que telle, un clip vidéo professionnel et de qualité est l’autre chose la plus importante à avoir pour pouvoir promouvoir notre musique et être capable de lancer une campagne de communication efficace.

	L’équipe

	Depuis mon arrivée en France, j’ai eu le plaisir de rencontrer les meilleurs musiciens, et je suis vraiment très fier de pouvoir partager la scène avec eux :Paul Lay - Piano

J’ai rencontré Paul au hasard lors d’une session organisée environ un mois après mon arrivée en France. D’habitude, dénicher des partenaires de scène prend du temps, mais des fois le hasard vous fait prendre les meilleures décisions. En plus d’être le meilleur pianiste avec qui j’ai jamais joué, son quartet Paul Lay « Mikado » ” (ミカド (ゲーム) venait tout juste de remporter à Paris le prestigieux prix de l’Académie Charles Cros dans la catégorie meilleur album jazz international de l’année. Voici ce que la légende du jazz Martial Solal dit de lui :

	« Excellente imagination harmonique, jeu très diversité, compositions des plus intéressantes, connaissance évidente de l’histoire du jazz, discours personnel : Paul Lay a tous les atouts pour monter et durer ! »
Florent Nisse - Contrebasse
Peu de temps après mon installation à Paris, lorsque j’ai entendu le nom « Florenisse », je pensais que c’était un nom de scène, comme ça peut être le cas pour Ronaldo au football ou Dr. J au basketball, et qu’il n’avait donc pas besoin de donner son nom de famille pour qu’on sache que c’est lui. Florent est l’un des meilleurs contrebassistes avec qui j’ai pu joué. Son ressenti du rythme rajoute une autre couche à la batterie et son gros son aide le piano à élargir ses graves. Il a été le gars faisant preuve du plus grand engagement sur scène et j’ai vraiment beaucoup de chance de l’avoir à mes côtés. 
Gautier Garrigue - Batterie

	Gautier est l’un des batteurs les plus actifs en France, et sa carrière l’a mené à jouer dans le monde entier sur des grandes scènes telles que le North Sea Festival, le Venezia Jazz Festival, Jazz à Vienne, Jazz in Marciac, le Victoria Jazz Festival, le Vancouver Jazz Festival. Tout comme moi, Gautier habitait loin de Paris avant de venir s’y installer puisqu’il est né à Perpignan, dans le Sud-Ouest de la France. Malgré son jeune âge, vous pouvez entendre sa maturité, aussi bien personnelle que musicale, dans chacun de ses coups de batterie.

המשימה


 מאז ילדותי תמיד חלמתי לעבור בשיגור ממקום למקום ממש כמו בסדרה ""מסע בין כוכבים"" כמו בקסם.
לקח לי קצת זמן להפנים שכרגע זה לא אפשרי, וככל הנראה גם לא בתקופת חיי. לעומת זאת, התחושה הזו, אשר לפתע את\ה מועבר\ת בה למציאות מקבילה ורמת תודעה שונה, קיימת באופן מסתורי כאשר מאזינים למוסיקה.

זהו מה שמניע אותי - לשנות למאזינים את התפישה והמציאות, הרחק מהעולם הגשמי והיומיומי ואל עבר המחשבות הסוריאליסטיות ואל הנקודה בה אתה מתחבר למה שבאמת יפה בחיים.

	 



	 

על הפרוייקט החדש

בתור מוסיקאי, התמזל לי להגשים את חלומי הגדול - לנסוע עם הלהקה בין ארצות ויבשות, ולארח קהלים רבים בקונצרטים. 

היום לאחר קרוב ל3 שנים עם הלהקה הקבועה, ברצוננו לתעד ולהקליט את המסעות הללו באלבום חדש, אנו נעריך לעד את תמיכתכם אשר תעזור לנו להגשים את המטרה.

אנו נעשה כמיטב יכולתנו כדי שההקלטה הזו גם תעביר אתכם בין מציאות אחת לשניה.

	4. יחסי ציבור וקמפיין עיתונות - מאחר והאלבום יופץ בסופו של דבר או על ידי חברת תקליטים (ישנם כרגע כבר כמה מתעניינים!) או בהפקה עצמית) לקחנו בחשבון שחייבים להשאיר בצד מספיק תקציב עבור מסע יח""צ, אשר מלבד המוסיקה, הוא האלמנט החשוב ביותר באלבומים חדשים.

</h3>
<div>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We are an alt/rock band from Birmingham, West Midlands, we write heavy but personal music. Our main influences come from 90's bands such as Nirvana, Smashing Pumpkins as well as more modern acts such as Superheaven, Basement and Tittle Fight. We've been together since late 2013, and have independently released one EP. Our campaign is important </span>because this will generate the funds necessary to have our album professionally printed, and will also contribute towards merchandise printing and our first ever short tour up and down the UK! </div>
<div>We are nearing the end of our university degrees and want to play music full time so without these funds, we will  be unable to achieve our goals. </div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We are aiming to raise £500. This will fund our CD printing costs, merchandise printing and travelling costs for our short tour we have planned around the UK. We want to get 50 CD's printed which will cost no more than £150. We will also be printing 50 t shirts with our original logo on them, which at a cost of £5 each will greatly contribute towards the cost incurred. The remaining funds will go towards the costs of travelling over the UK on tour. </p>

</div></div>","Short Summary


We are an alt/rock band from Birmingham, West Midlands, we write heavy but personal music. Our main influences come from 90's bands such as Nirvana, Smashing Pumpkins as well as more modern acts such as Superheaven, Basement and Tittle Fight. We've been together since late 2013, and have independently released one EP. Our campaign is important because this will generate the funds necessary to have our album professionally printed, and will also contribute towards merchandise printing and our first ever short tour up and down the UK! 
We are nearing the end of our university degrees and want to play music full time so without these funds, we will  be unable to achieve our goals.    What We Need & What You Get We are aiming to raise £500. This will fund our CD printing costs, merchandise printing and travelling costs for our short tour we have planned around the UK. We want to get 50 CD's printed which will cost no more than £150. We will also be printing 50 t shirts with our original logo on them, which at a cost of £5 each will greatly contribute towards the cost incurred. The remaining funds will go towards the costs of travelling over the UK on tour. 
Like our music, our perks will also be personal. Pledging your money means you will be receiving gifts such as meet and greets at our gigs, signed merchandise and album credits so you can feel a part of our journey as band too. 
If we don't reach our entire goal, the funds we have raised will go towards the printing of the CD's. This is the most important part of our campaign because we just want to be able to put our music out there and sell it at up and coming shows. 
    The Impact Our project is valuable to all contributors because they will now be a part of our journey as a group as we hope to grow as musicians and song writers, and hopefully become as a big a band as we can possibly hope to be. We want our songs played on the radio for as many people to hear, so your contributions towards touring and CD pressing costs will go a long way to making this dream real.  
    Risks & Challenges
Our main risk with hoping to going on tour to promote our album and getting the CD's printed is that if we can not generate any funds from this campaign we won't be able to get our music out to people as we hope to. This is why your money and generosity is so important to our campaign; without you, none of this will be able to happen. All we want is to write good music and to be able to play it to as many people as possible, that's our goal, not only for the next few years but as our full-time jobs.

I've also worked on my songwriting craft by attending the <a href=""https://www.bluegrass.com/songschool/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Rocky Mountain Song School</a>, and starting a Songwriter Circle here in the Bay Area.</p><p>I've continued to teach private voice lessons, singing workshops, and group singing classes for LGBTQ people and allies, and studied an approach to voice teaching called <a href=""http://somaticvoicework.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Somatic Voicework - The LoVetri Method™</a>. Through this process I realized I was having some vocal challenges of my own, and worked with master voice teacher Jeanie LoVetri to address the constriction that was impeding my sound and freedom of expression.
