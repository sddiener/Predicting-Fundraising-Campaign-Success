<h3>The Black Pullet: An Introduction</h3>
<p>The <i>Black Pullet</i> (""La Poule Noire"") is a nineteenth century, French, talismanic ritual book and tradition as well as an often-overlooked piece of magical history that continues to influence a large cross segment of different cultures, people and traditions. </p>
<h3>What We Are Contributing</h3>
<p>In spite of its popularity, up until now the <i>Black Pullet</i> has only seen hastily thrown-together reprints, often riddled with typos, none of which offered any additional research or information into the book itself. This campaign is to help us publish 2 new books on the subject, which will be the gold standard of the <i>Black Pullet</i> tradition for decades to come. We are also offering 2 new ritual circle cloths based on descriptions in the book as well as expanded and clarified magical instructions to finally make this a workable magical system, after 2 centuries of confusion.</p>
<h3>Why 2 Books? </h3>
<p>These two new books serve two different purposes.</p>
<p>The first of the two books is called “<u><strong><i>The Black Pullet Grimoire: Secrets of the Sage of the Pyramids</i></strong></u>,” and it is specifically designed as a manual for use in your temple. It is a small, full-color hardback book with a sewn-in bookmark. It is small in size and concise, with all of the extraneous material removed. As practicing magicians, we are well aware that large books can sometimes overtake your altar space during a working, so we designed this book with practical ritual use in mind. It has the instructions clearly laid out for each of the 20 talismans and rings, with the prayers and magical words in bold and any hand gestures or other magical instructions clearly indicated. It is also the first time that all 20 of the <i>Black Pullet</i> talismans will have been published in <strong>FULL COLOR</strong>. This small, hardcover, temple manual is being limited to 50 copies only <i>(if a few more copies are needed to fill orders from this campaign, we will print those, as well, but following this fund-raising campaign, this small, full-color hardcover, temple manual will be put out-of-print</i>).</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1546290412/ntsakpl7ixb7ljitro4i.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>The second book, a paperback, is called “<u><strong><i>A Modern User’s Guide to the Black Pullet</i></strong></u>,” and it contains the entire text of the <i>Black Pullet </i>in a new translation; however, it doesn’t just contain the text of the original book. It is the first and only book on the subject to contain an extended introduction which includes not only historical information regarding the publishing history and sources, as well as confusion over several related texts, but it also debunks several common myths and misconceptions about the original text. Also included is a lengthy section on magical instructions for performing advanced rituals of this sort; what kinds of preparations should be made; what sorts of magical tools are needed and so forth. There are also never-before-published ritual instructions for use with the <i>Black Pullet</i>. Regarding the ritual directions included in the book, the savvy ritualist will know how to adjust the instructions for other rituals, and as thus, it's quite an invaluable section of writing in its own regard. This book, “<i>A Modern User’s Guide to the Black Pullet</i>,” is being offered as an unlimited paperback, which will be available for years to come, in our hopes of it aiding future generations of magical practitioners.</p>

<h3>How You Can Help</h3>
<p>You can help offset our printing costs by pre-ordering either or both of these new books, as well as the 2 newly created circle cloths (<i>based on the diagrams in the Black Pullet</i>), which have been previously unavailable.</p>

<p>The first of the two circles is a 4-foot circle cloth, with a red border around the circumference. This circle is done in the classic style of a Grand Magical Circle, as seen in many of the French texts of the time. The version we are offering matches exactly the version featured in the <i>Black Pullet</i>.</p>

<p>The second of the two circles is a larger, 6-foot circle cloth, featuring a gold-colored ouroboros which hugs the circumference of the entire circle. The version we are offering matches exactly the version featured in the <i>Black Pullet</i>. We have smartly designed it large enough, in order to be able to put the slightly smaller 4-foot circle inside the larger one, if so desired.</p>

<h3>Magical Ritual Tools</h3>
</div><div>
<p>The<i> Black Pullet </i>magical tradition is a collection of 20 talisman &amp; ring sets, each designed with a different magical goal in mind. All 20 of these are being made available at a reduced price, for the duration of this fund-raising campaign. For those who may have previously read the book, you'll know that 2 different ritual circles are mentioned in the text (<i>along with diagrams of the circles</i>). As mentioned above, we are also making ritual circle cloths of these 2 designs available for the first time, for any individuals who want to employee them for use, in their personal temples. </p>

<h3>The 20 Black Pullet Sets</h3>
<p>This is a list of all 20 <i>Black Pullet</i> ring &amp; talisman sets, which you’ll need to choose from, if you choose a perk which includes one (<i>or more</i>) of these sets. Each set includes one ring &amp; talisman which were designed to be used together. We have made these items exactly to the specifications described in the <i>Black Pullet</i>. Each talisman is about 3.75-inches in width and embroidered on satin in their designated colors. The ring is a standard men's 11.5, made of bronzed-steel, as described in the text and contains the secret symbols (<i>different for each ring</i>) on the underside of the ring itself. In the photograph, they can be seen in numerical order, from left to right and top to bottom:</p>
<p>#1 Conjures the celestial and infernal spirits.<br/><br/>#2 Gives love from women.<br/><br/>#3 Discovers treasures.<br/><br/>#4 Reveals hidden secrets and lets you penetrate everywhere unseen.<br/><br/>#5 Will make the people tell you their secrets.<br/><br/>#6 Sets genii to work achieving any work desired, and to stop any which oppose you.<br/><br/>#7 Destroys with storms and earthquakes, but preserves friends.<br/><br/>#8 Gives invisibility and power of passing through walls.<br/><br/>#9 Transports to any part of the world without danger.<br/><br/>#10 Opens all locks.<br/><br/>#11 Remote vision and thought reading.<br/><br/>#12 Destroys all plans made against you.<br/><br/>#13 Makes you and all things virtuous.<br/><br/>#14 Bestows healing powers.<br/><br/>#15 Protects from animal and allows you to communicate with them.<br/><br/>#16 Gives the discernment for the good or bad intentions of any person.<br/><br/>#17 Gives talent in the arts and scholarly pursuits.<br/><br/>#18 Gives good fortune in all lotteries.<br/><br/>#19 Gives the power of directing all the infernal hosts against your enemies.<br/><br/>#20 Gives you the ability to know the plans of evil powers.</p>

</div></div>","Introduction

One man. One laptop. Thousands of ideas.
The somewhat simple writing does not seem that much when compared to all the technological breakthroughs that are happening every year. It will however, remain the ''purest'' form of communication, a means of expressing thoughts and emotions.
Connecting with people from all around the world through writing is exciting!
Expect brand new fantasy elements and mystery which will leave you hungering for more. 


Funding and how it will work

Money invested in my project will go towards paying the rent: the rent of the place where I will continue to stay to write the second half of the book. As I will be living alone, personal expenses are also included.
Fair pay for fair work = I am making my work available to the readers, who can review it first. They can then decide for themselves, based upon how much they like the idea, how much to invest. 
If overfunding happens, it will lead to a more ''polished'' version of the book and will cover the costs of the graphic perks that will be in development, while considerably increasing the chances of a trilogy!
No matter what the final results of the project are, I will still offer what was promised!


The Impact it will have

I have always enjoyed writing: It's a unique, creative experience.
This project is very important to me, in the sense that you readers have the possibility of shaping my future.
There is no such thing as too many authors! I consider that a lot of people have the ability to express their thoughts and emotions through pen and paper. If this happened more often, people would get along better.


Challenges and overcoming them

Writing a book is a challenge. Combining real facts with fantasy would be the best outcome, but with that also come copyright-related problems.. Taking that in consideration, I started sending out e-mails, asking for the right to use some trademarks but if I do not get a positive answer, I will have to make some changes.
Words and sentences might change(In a positive way). What I am creating is a work in progress!
Delivering something good to the reader will be the hardest challenge I have ever picked up.

I wrote this book because there was not a blueprint for first-generation and minority students transitioning to college. This was something I struggled with in the early stages of my academic career and feel that sharing my experiences through this four year ride will be beneficial to those who come from the same background as myself and are also first generation college students.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that you are not alone in this experience. The journey will have its ups and downs, but that is only to test your will to succeed. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to engage with the themes of; “storm before the calm”, which is dealing with adversity before everything gets better, “am I enough”, which deals with questioning one’s self worth and whether they belong in an environment; and “cheers to the mayhem“ which is the growth section of the book. It deals with realizing the lessons learned from experiencing adversity and being uncomfortable which provides proof that one is built for success.<br/> </p><p><strong>The 4-Year Ride</strong></p><p>The book is written in 3 Parts....<br/><br/>Part [1] “The Storm before the Calm”<br/>This section is dealing with adversity before everything gets better.

<li>The Copyediting for My Book - to make help polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication</li>
<li>The Launch &amp; Promotion Efforts for my book - when I ultimately publish this winter.</li>
</ul><p>When I pre-sell 120 copies of my book, I will publish. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish a hardcover edition.

She has given a TEDx Talk October 2019 discussing the experience of a first-gen and how she was able to overcome her personal battles.<br/><br/>THIS IS THE BOOK I WISH SOMEONE HAD GIVEN ME WHEN I BEGAN MY 4 YEAR COLLEGE JOURNEY AS A FIRST-GEN student. I made this blueprint so other first-gen students can get an idea of what to expect and therefor be even more prepared and successful in their own journey .<br/><br/>I am someone who is extremely ambitious, determined and a goal-getter. When I want something, I do not, under any circumstances, take no for an answer.

I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.<br/><br/>The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you.

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<i>Endless: A Villain’s Love Story</i> is a kaleidoscopic exploration of love, brokenness, and ambition.<br/><br/>My name is Ananya Mallik, and I am the author of <i>Endless: A Villain’s Love Story</i>. I wrote this book because I wanted to explore the dark side of love and passion. I wanted to take the traditional narrative and flip it on its head so that my story could explore the dangers and the untold stories of passion gone awry. The embedded narrative allows for a non-linear chronological structure, enabling the reader to delve deeper into the motivations and emotions of each character.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the pitfalls of never pursuing your dreams. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to engage with the nuance that exists between trying to follow your dreams or just conforming to societal expectations. The book tells the story of a woman who wants nothing more than to desperately escape from her life, but she experiences trauma every time she attempts rebellion. The book follows the joys of a life driven by passion but also of the dangers of obsessive love.<br/><br/>Amid the honeyed air of their Italian summer romance, Alana awakens to see that the man she ran away with, Milan, has suddenly deserted her. When her rebellion for love fails spectacularly, Alana finally succumbs to her parent's wishes and buries her dream of being an artist. Many years later, she develops a relationship with her childhood friend Riaan, slowly embracing a life of caged stability. However, Alana’s suppressed desires are stirred as Milan returns and embroils her in a world of mystery, intrigue, and death. Faced with a choice between the two men, Alana’s decision may anchor her into deadly waters.<br/><br/>You will love this book if you enjoy thrillers, romance, or contemporary fiction.<br/><br/><i>Endless</i> speaks to teenagers and adults who want to grapple with the quest for individuality and learning not to trust appearances in a new way.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that <i>Endless</i> inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:<ul>
<li>How far would you go for love?</li>
<li>Is it better to live within society’s standards if the consequences of rebellion hurt those you love?</li>
<li>Is death the ultimate form of liberation?</li>
</ul> I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing individuality and the facades we build up to conform to society will change us all for the better.<br/> <h2>The Book -<i> Endless</i>
</h2>The book is written in 5 acts, following the structure of a traditional Greek tragedy.<br/><br/><strong>Part 1 </strong>introduces the reader to Alana’s world in the present.

The reader learns how she met him on a cruise and eventually they run away to Italy together.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3</strong> builds up the intrigue and suspense as both men become active suitors in her life, but their (and her) bad choices result in a series of deaths.

<h2><strong>This is my Story...</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>My name is Mary Elizabeth, but you can call me...ME!!!</strong></h3>
<p>My story is a survivor's story of hope, truimph and perservance.  Come go with me as we explore the negative experiences of child abuse first-hand.  My journey takes me to a place of solitude, fear and despair. Yet, despite it all, I do a brave thing...I tell my Mom...In the end, my act of courage and bravery allows me to overcome the stain of child abuse and hopefully my voice can be the voice or catalyst for other's to speak out as well.</p>
<h3>
<span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">""No one has the right to touch my private place, No one has the right to invade my private space.""</span><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;""> </span>
</h3>
<p><strong>""My Private Space""</strong> <span>is a self-help children's book written to enlighten, encourage and empower.  As a personal eight year survivor of child abuse myself, I have endured the embarrassment and degradation of molestation first hand.  I became a victim of someone who used my innocence to silence my voice.  However, my own internal navigational system has guided me to my present place of peace and comfort. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>""How many others go silent, yet are screaming internally for help?""</h3>
<p> </p>
<h2>Here are the Facts....</h2>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Adult retrospective studies show that 1 in 4 women and 1 in 6 men were sexually abused before the age of 18 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2006). This means there are more than 42 million adult survivors of child sexual abuse in the U.S. today.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Consequently, the American Cancer Society estimates there are more survivors of sexual abuse, (42 million) then the 12 million cancer survivors in the U.S. (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2006).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Like rape, child molestation is one of the most underreported crimes: only 1-10% are ever disclosed.-FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>""The serial killer has the same personality characteristics as the sex offender against children""-Dr. Mace Knapp, Nevada State Prison Psychologist.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Nearly 70% of all reported sexual assaults, including those on adults, occur on children ages 17 and under.           (<a href=""http://www.adultsprotectingchildren.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.adultsprotectingchildren.com</a>)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Approximately 20% of the victims of sexual abuse are under the age of 8. (<a href=""http://www.adultsprotectingchildren.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.adultsprotectingchildren.com</a>)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Over 90% of child sex abuse cases presented to prosecutors do not go to trial. Over 1/2 are not charged or dropped after charging. (<a href=""http://www.adultsprotectingchildren.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.adultsprotectingchildren.com</a>) </li>
</ul>
<h3> </h3>
<h2>Negative Consequences of Child Abuse...</h2>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Sexually abused children who keep it a secret or who ""tell"" and are not believed may be at greater risk than the general population for psychological, emotional, social and physical problems often lasting into adulthood.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>60% of teen-first pregnancies are preceded by experiences of molestation, rape or attempted rape.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>70-80% of sexual abuse victims report excessive drug/alcohol use.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Girls who are abused are more likely to develop eating disorders.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>50% of abuse victims have thoughts of suicide and 20% have attempted suicide.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>High school drop-out rates are high among those who are abused.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3> </h3>
<h2>Financial Burden....</h2>
<div>According to the Department of Justice, the cost of one incident of child sexual abuse is approximately $14,400. (Then there are the long-term losses that impact the community, such as loss of earning potential due to poor performance in school, major health issues lasting into adulthood. Who pays these costs? You, the taxpayer! This is why we say child sexual abuse is a community issue which calls for broad community support for prevention.)</div>
<div>•Consider for example, the economic impact of these three North Georgia counties:</div>
<p>   <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">County</span>        <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Population</span>    <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Immediate cost (annually)</span>          <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Long-term Losses (annually)</span></p>
<div>•Hall           185,000                   $1.6 million                        $16.4 million</div>
<div>•Lumpkin       27,500                    $200,000                          $2.4 million</div>
<div>•Gwinnett     789,500                    $6.8 million                        $70 million</div>
<h3> </h3>
<h2>Mission, Strategies and Expectations</h2>
<h3>This is my Mission:</h3>
<p>To put an end to the sexual abuse of children by training children and adults in how to prevent, recognize and react responsibly to child sexual abuse. </p>
<h3>This is my Strategy:</h3>
<div>To introduce “My Private Space” as a self-help, self-motivating book, complete with accompanying workbook.  This initiative helps to bridge the gap between apathy and ignorance concerning sexual child abuse.  Many cases go unnoticed simply because many children do not tell. </div>
<h3>This is my Expectation:</h3>
<p>My goal is to reach at least 5% of the population in each state, which will be done through the school system, local libraries, book signing events and child abuse advocacy agencies across the U.S. </p>
<div>That is what we are all about--a cultural change. I want to see each State and hopefully, Worldwide, move from a place where child sexual abuse is shrouded in fear and denial, which keeps kids vulnerable, to one where preventing sexual abuse is openly discussed and there is simply no place for a molester to have freedom to assault children. </div>
<p><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;""> </span></p>
<h2><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Your Impact</span></h2>
</div>
<div>
<p>This is how you contribution will help propel this vision into a reality.  I am in the final stages of book completion, however, in order to get the message out, I would need to have book printed and effectively marketed.  My initial appoarch is to self-publish, because this gives me the best option for creative control of the book.  See below a brief breakdown of how your contribution will best be used to bring this book into mainstream:</p>
<p>Print 1200 copies              $6080</p>
<p>Shipping Cost                   $172</p>
<p>Website Development        $425</p>
<p>Artwork/Artist commission   $500</p>
<p>Marketing/Media Kit           $535</p>
<p>ISBN                                $300</p>
<p>Five City Tour(includes book signing engagements and set-up)  $ 1988</p>
<p>Estimated Total: $10,000.00</p>

""My Private Space"" is a self-help children's book written to enlighten, encourage and empower.  As a personal eight year survivor of child abuse myself, I have endured the embarrassment and degradation of molestation first hand.  I became a victim of someone who used my innocence to silence my voice.  However, my own internal navigational system has guided me to my present place of peace and comfort. 
 
""How many others go silent, yet are screaming internally for help?""
 
Here are the Facts....




Adult retrospective studies show that 1 in 4 women and 1 in 6 men were sexually abused before the age of 18 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2006). This means there are more than 42 million adult survivors of child sexual abuse in the U.S. today.




Consequently, the American Cancer Society estimates there are more survivors of sexual abuse, (42 million) then the 12 million cancer survivors in the U.S. (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2006).




Like rape, child molestation is one of the most underreported crimes: only 1-10% are ever disclosed.-FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin.




""The serial killer has the same personality characteristics as the sex offender against children""-Dr. Mace Knapp, Nevada State Prison Psychologist.




Nearly 70% of all reported sexual assaults, including those on adults, occur on children ages 17 and under.           (www.adultsprotectingchildren.com)




Approximately 20% of the victims of sexual abuse are under the age of 8. (www.adultsprotectingchildren.com)



Over 90% of child sex abuse cases presented to prosecutors do not go to trial. Over 1/2 are not charged or dropped after charging. (www.adultsprotectingchildren.com) 

 
Negative Consequences of Child Abuse...


Sexually abused children who keep it a secret or who ""tell"" and are not believed may be at greater risk than the general population for psychological, emotional, social and physical problems often lasting into adulthood.




60% of teen-first pregnancies are preceded by experiences of molestation, rape or attempted rape.




70-80% of sexual abuse victims report excessive drug/alcohol use.




Girls who are abused are more likely to develop eating disorders.




50% of abuse victims have thoughts of suicide and 20% have attempted suicide.




High school drop-out rates are high among those who are abused.


 
Financial Burden....
According to the Department of Justice, the cost of one incident of child sexual abuse is approximately $14,400. (Then there are the long-term losses that impact the community, such as loss of earning potential due to poor performance in school, major health issues lasting into adulthood. Who pays these costs? You, the taxpayer! This is why we say child sexual abuse is a community issue which calls for broad community support for prevention.)
•Consider for example, the economic impact of these three North Georgia counties:
   County        Population    Immediate cost (annually)          Long-term Losses (annually)
•Hall           185,000                   $1.6 million                        $16.4 million
•Lumpkin       27,500                    $200,000                          $2.4 million
•Gwinnett     789,500                    $6.8 million                        $70 million
 
Mission, Strategies and Expectations
This is my Mission:
To put an end to the sexual abuse of children by training children and adults in how to prevent, recognize and react responsibly to child sexual abuse. 
This is my Strategy:
To introduce “My Private Space” as a self-help, self-motivating book, complete with accompanying workbook.  This initiative helps to bridge the gap between apathy and ignorance concerning sexual child abuse.  Many cases go unnoticed simply because many children do not tell. 
This is my Expectation:
My goal is to reach at least 5% of the population in each state, which will be done through the school system, local libraries, book signing events and child abuse advocacy agencies across the U.S. 
That is what we are all about--a cultural change. I want to see each State and hopefully, Worldwide, move from a place where child sexual abuse is shrouded in fear and denial, which keeps kids vulnerable, to one where preventing sexual abuse is openly discussed and there is simply no place for a molester to have freedom to assault children.

The 5,000 euros is primarily going to be used for publication and, also, I need the money to pay for a graphic designer, translation assistance, distribution and PR.Depending on the funds collected, my wish is to publish the book in three languages, Danish, French and English, so my stories can reach a bigger audience.I hope you will help me make this book a reality. Thank you so much!//Marie Louise-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Support this project if you:· Love Paris· Love organic food· Love and care for the environment· Love good stories· Love good portraits· Love beautiful books· Love beautiful photographs· Love to give your support to an authentic, organic city guide that doesn’t look like all the others-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------About me (Marie Louise Albers):I’m a 26-year-old Danish journalist, based in Paris for almost three years.

<p>The mission of the book will be to provide real-world examples of some of the most important and creative individuals alive today, as a way of demonstrating to readers that creativity and innovation are not exclusively used and owned by any type of person or industry.

By sharing techniques for maximising creativity and lessons that can be learned from those who have done so, I hope that this book will represent a new definitive text to readers: a snapshot of creativity as it is manifested at this point in history.</p>

<h2><b>WHO WILL BENEFIT</b></h2>
<p>The audience of this book is a broad and diverse target group of anyone who is interested in creativity, participates in an innovative industry, or is simply looking to be inspired by the stories of genius that are happening every day. As mentioned earlier, creativity is not reserved for a specific demographic or cultural group, it is a unifying force that empowers people all around the globe. For that reason, I would expect that everyone from teenagers in rural America to aspiring CEOs could find something in this book that will appeal or apply to them. Struggling musicians, home-based business owners, and HR managers could all find gems of wisdom and insight in the pages of this proposed book, since I intend for it to be as inclusive and comprehensive as possible. When we talk about people that have been involved in the creative process, that grouping includes almost every single person on the planet, because simple problem solving and critical thinking that we do on an everyday basis has its roots in creativity and the adaptability of reality. This may sound slightly philosophical, but when our experience is stripped down to its essence, we are all active participants in the creative process, so I would hope that the potential audience that could benefit from this book would be equally universal.</p>
<h2><b>EXAMPLES OF CREATIVE INDIVIDUALS</b></h2>
<p>I will examine 13-16 creative individuals that have made a significant impact in recent years in their respective field, and has a unique approach to the creative process. For example, I will dissect the creative approach that Barack Obama took to politics during the first “social media election”, as well as Lee Clow’s evolution of advertising with Apple over the past few decades. In terms of the entertainment industry, I want to delve into the Coen Brother’s fascinating style of realistic filmmaking, while the blending of science and art in the culinary genius of Ferran Adria will be another of the chapters.

WHY I AM DOING THIS

The single most important force that has driven humanity forward from lighting fires in caves to leaving footsteps on the moon has been creativity. Throughout history, the act of creation and the desire to make something new has laid the groundwork for everything we now take for granted, and will continue to shape our future.

<p><b>Who We Are   <br/></b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We're Jana and Mike Llewellyn and we're starting a small publishing company called First Day Press. One day, we hope First Day Press will be the publisher behind some of the most inspired and thoughtful books and e-books you read. But first, we're bringing together the work of great writers for a project called The First Day.</span></p>
<p><b>What is The First Day?   <br/></b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The First Day is an online magazine and quarterly print journal that uses literature, the arts, and personal stories as a way to explore faith and spirituality. We want to create a space where people from all different faiths and backgrounds can share and learn from individual experiences of struggle, despair, hope, and love. See the website at <a href=""http://www.firstdaypress.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.firstdaypress.org</a>. </span></p>
<p><b>Why is it important?   <br/></b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Everyone has a profound spiritual life, regardless of their background, specific beliefs, or the words they use to describe it. One of the most powerful ways to explore your spirituality is to hear other people's stories of their own journeys.</span></p>
<p>Today, there are very few ways to learn about spirituality that aren't tied to a particular religion or philosophy. And there are even fewer places built for high-quality, open-minded, agenda-free writing about faith and spirituality.</p>
<p>The First Day is a home for great writing about all the many ways people try to find strength, beauty, and peace in themselves and in the world around them.</p>
<p><b>Is The First Day affiliated with any organized religion?   <br/></b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The First Day isn't affiliated with any organized religion or ideology. It's an interfaith publication by and for people with a very diverse range of beliefs and perspectives. </span></p>
<p>Our own perspective is rooted in a spiritual journey that brought us to Quakerism, a faith that we were attracted to in large part for its openness and respect for other traditions. As we build The First Day, we'll be guided by our belief in the Quaker testimonies of stewardship, peace, integrity, community, equality, and simplicity. </p>
<p><b>How much is needed?   <br/></b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">To launch The First Day successfully, we'd like to raise $30,000. The funds will be applied to the production and operating costs of the magazine and website over the next 12 months, and will allow us to invest our time in making The First Day self-sustaining over the long term.</span></p>
<p><b>How will the money be used?   <br/></b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Right now, our biggest expense by far is printing and postage, and will require about two thirds of our funding. The money will cover all or most of the printing and postage for the first and second issues while we continue to add advertisers and paid subscribers. </span></p>
<p>Our next largest expense is promotion. The bulk of our promotional spending will be for online advertising, mainly on Facebook and through Google AdWords. Additional promotional expenses will include a small number of display ads, conference attendance, email marketing, etc.</p>
<p>Finally, we have a some technology expenses to cover: freelance web development help, additional design and publishing software, the costs of running the site (email, hosting, shopping cart software).</p>
<p><b>What happens if the goal isn't met?<br/></b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">For this project to succeed, it needs adequate funding, and we believe the necessary support for this project is out there. If we don't hit our funding goal, we'll keep moving forward, but we'll likely have to delay the first issue by a few weeks, scale back the page count, and reduce our promotional activity until we can try for the funding again.</span></p>
<p><b>What are the perks?<br/></b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">This magazine is all about great writing, and our perks reflect that. Depending on the level of support, you can receive subscriptions, a personalized inaugural issue, bonus digital content, poetry that's framed and signed by the author, a thank-you note on the website, or your support called out proudly in our print edition. We also have some pretty great buttons that say, ""I'm quite fond of First Day Press.""</span></p>
<p><b>Is there anything to do besides contribute to this campaign?<br/></b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Sure! You can share this campaign through indiegogo's share tools. You can subscribe or advertise with us. You can get as many of your friends and family members as you can to like us on Facebook and read our online posts. You can submit your own work for review.

<div><b>Without you, there would be far less poetry in this world. </b></div> </div> <p><br/></p></div>","Hi y'all, it's Terra here.A native Louisiana species, I am a proud feminist writer of Lafayette and for New Orleans, and my literary passions lie in the exploration of thematic crossroads between sexuality, hybridity, ecology, feminism, and regionalism.

In childhood, my world revolved around books-- a new title every week. Voted ""most likely to write a memoir"" in high school, I aptly left Lafayette for a stranger port of harbor. I wasn't sure what, but knew I wanted to create.

As an English major in New Orleans, I realized my liberal arts future would never be lavish (the subsequent student loans confirmed it). Having lived here nearly 7 years, my love of New Orleans is the most important of my life thus far; there are no words to illuminate the ways the city has shaped my growth. 

But words are what have come of it-- a whole lot of them, growing in a community of artists, creators, individuals, weirdos, and other people like me. It's truly home. And here we are still; and 24 years later, I can say today that my whole life's work in writing (up to this point) has come to ripe fruition.


Friends & cherished folks, I'm pleased to announce the publishing of my debut chapbook and poetry collection, Last Waters.








Fast Facts about the project: 



Next Left Press, a local non-profit publisher, is hand-binding, building, and publishing the book, which was written about and to this elusive city over the course of 5 years, across several different countries. 


A fragmented narrative told in poetry, Last Waters contains over 33 poems, features cover illustration by dear friend and talented artist Audrey Lloyd, and incorporates unique structural design details such as pop-out poems, glyphs, and more. Support me in publishing my debut poetry collection! Donate, pre-order, and dive into Last Waters.

Challenges, Your Help, and The Final Impact


Raw materials for 200 books (published in batches of 100) are purchased, the manuscript is complete, cover art created, and first edition chapbook building is underway as we speak.


Our publishing deadline for releasing the first batch: Halloween weekend 2015...in just two weeks. With your financial backing, the artist, publisher, and writer will be reimbursed at cost for supplies, secure the amount needed to start labor, and finally, the books can start getting assembled. 


We need $1,000 to get this book paid for and out in the world. So far, every step of the process has been out-of-pocket, and we can't complete this project without you. Support local art and realize the collaborative dream of three artists who want to create beautiful art objects for the world to enjoy.This will be treated more of a pre-order than a crowdfunder--if you support this project, you support local writers and art creation. There are perks that come with that! Get excited!
If we don't reach the entire goal, the creators involved can't afford to publish the book at this point, and the publication will be halted (or stopped altogether, if expenses can't be covered). Since 100% of the profits of this book goes to the artist and writer, the proliferation of great art and community-minded art appreciators will prevail!
Other Ways You Can Help
 Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't still help:  Reach out to folks! Get the word out and stir interest in the book! Use the Indiegogo share tools! Facebook! Twitter! Go forth!
 
Above all, THANK YOU for being readers and supporters of the arts in all the capacities you cover. 
Whether through money or word-of-mouth, your aid is vital, because it's folks like you who inspire artists to create. 
Without you, there would be far less poetry in this world.",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>I'll be a second year Burner in 2012.  In my first year, I was amazed by incredible visual art and sound camps on the playa, but as a writer, I missed my own art form, literature.  This year, KEROSENE is bringing the work of 47 writers to the playa as a print magazine and burnable billbaord that are simultaneously turning into more and more interesting visual art as we work through the details.    </p>
<p>This is a highly collaborative project!  First and foremost, people offered their writing.     Originally, I had planned to curate the magazine and pick ""the best"" pieces.  In the end, I saw that the pieces illuminate one another in interesting ways and decided to turn my planned 10-page magazine into a 60-page, fully inclusive literary offering.  This means raising a lot more money than originally planned and that's where you come in.</p>
<p>People have offered much more than just their writing.  They've helped me plan the burnable billboard--designing it, building it, shipping it, lighting it, powering it and burning it.  They've offered help in erecting it once we're on the playa, designing the print magazine, getting the website live, and keeping this project going.  Most of these people were strangers before KEROSENE brought us together.  The collaborative nature of all this has been deeply fun and extremely moving.  Thanks to all of you!</p>
<p>Along the way, one of the writers offered to bring the magazines and her own version of the burnable billbaord to Burn in the Firest, the Vancouver regional Burning Man event.  Thanks to the wonderful Kimpossible!  Additional funding raised here will be offered to Kimpossible for the Vancouver KEROSENE--printing and billboard.</p>
<p>Funding for this project will cover:</p>
<p>--printing of magazines (about $5 per copy--thanks to Kimpossible for finding a cheap printer!)  $750-$1,350</p>
<p>--building materials and stuff to secure the billboard against wind (thanks to Frankie and Ty for essential help in planning)  $200</p>
<p>--lighting and powering the lights (an additional $200 if we go solar!--thanks to Mike and Pieter for planning) $325-$525</p>
<p>--transportation of billboard and magazines (thanks to the NY Container Crew)  $200</p>
<p>--Burn and clean up materials (fire extinguishers, rakes, etc)   $70</p>
<p>--Stuff I forget that I'll realize I need to fund later  $55</p>
<p>--Indegogo fees and shipping of reqards to generous funders like you  $300</p>
<p>IF YOU FUND US, you can choose from among yummy perks.  EVEN IF YOU CAN'T FUND US, please pass the word out.  Post news of this campaign on your Burning Man regional list and send it out to your friends.  You can really help us that way.  And come visit the billboard if you make it to the playa!  We'll be having a party there, probably on Tuesday evening at sundown (placement of the billboard is still unclear, we'll do our best to publicize this later)  And come watch us burn our writing (time to be determined)!</p>

After moving to the US and eventually becoming a fire fighter and working other odd jobs during the week, with some weeks, working 120 hours in order to provide for his family! However, Dave never gave up and eventually went on to host multiple seasons of A&amp;E's hit TV show, Flipping Boston and starting a $100M private equity fund!</p> <p>I share my story of how my wife and I purchased our first fix-n-flip project in Alexandria, VA. I share the challenges in finding the right property, securing financing and the due diligence required to ensure the deal would be profitable. Additionally, I talk about the mindset behind the decision to move forward with the project despite facing some uncertainty and unknown challenges after closing.</p> <p>Another great story is the story of Vinney Chipora and how he came to the United States with only $7 to his name! Vinney came to the US to obtain a Master's degree and took a job in the summertime going door to door selling books back in the late 1970s. Afterwards, he went on to take a job opportunity in San Francisco as a promotional consultant and began his real estate career investing in single family and multifamily properties. Today, Vinney has been a key principal in the acquisition of over 4,500 apartment units across 34 multifamily syndications in the last 10+ years.</p>

Over the last six years, Johnny has purchased and sold over two dozen single family properties and one apartment across four different markets. He holds a Masters Degree in Business Administration from TUI University, Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from The University of Alabama, and Financial Planning and Services Certification from Northwestern University.<br/><br/>Born in Detroit, MI, Johnny Lynum is a genuine, servant leader who strives to make a positive impact wherever he goes. He grew up in Whatley, AL with his parents Johnnie and Ruth Lynum and his sister Johnnetta. Johnny has always excelled at whatever he does whether in the class room, on the basketball court, or managing a $1.2 Billion software development program.<br/><br/>He wrote this book to assist others who didn't receive the financial knowledge at home or in school to build generational wealth. Johnny believes we all start from different positions in life, but we all have the ability to be successful if we have the right strategy. What he loves most about real estate is the ability to create passive income to buy back your time instead of having to constantly work for money.<br/><br/>Johnny has a beautiful wife and three kids who he loves to spend time with when not working. They love to travel and experience new areas and new cultures.

Financial confidence is crucial for business owners to make effective financial decisions, yet only 25% of businesses in the world accurately keep track of and record their financial data. <br/><br/>My name is Chris Arredondo and I am the author of The Curious Business Owner. I wrote this book to help business owners overcome the obstacles in business by being more aware of how important financial management is to making more mindful decisions and maximizing the performance of the business. In my research I found that using a curious mindset is key to building financial success. When we use our curiosity we develop an interest in our social and psychological capital and by capturing the right financial data we can make better financial decisions. <br/><br/>I’ve learned about many of the obstacles that small business owners face throughout my career and my relationships with business owners. I have seen how many times obstacles are created internally and unfortunately the struggles increase over the life of the business causing a downward spiral. I continuously encountered business owners that had capped off their willingness to expand their business mindset because they feel that revenue will fix all their problems. We get told to hustle harder but it is the business owners that incorporate innovation, development, and a continued motivation of learning new ways of doing things that create a better foundation for success.  <br/><br/>As financial problems become the main cause of business failure, the solution of the problem gets ignored by the stress of the situation. Financial management is recognized as the leading objective for business growth and development yet entrepreneurs continue to ignore the significance their financial performance plays in their long term success.<br/><br/>I will demonstrate how curiosity can help develop the most important aspect of a business, capital. Most people’s attention is on Financial Capital, since it is the leading cause of business failure, but I will make the argument that curiosity builds financial stability through a focus on:</p><ul>
<li>Human Capital - creating an environment that encourages an exchange of ideas through communication. </li>
<li>Social Capital - creating a network of people that hold us accountable.</li>
<li>Data Capital - creating processes that capture as much information as possible about the business, to make informed decisions.</li>
</ul><p>Psychological Capital - creating an understanding of who we are as a leader of an organization.</p><p>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will gain an interest in how curiosity creates a grounded confidence that helps us improve decision making and our daily habits. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same passion and excitement that I have in learning from others. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to become a better problem solver, overcome fears, develop empathy, and become more knowledgable and self-aware as a business owner. <br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn how to overcome the common failures small business owners face and how the habit of a curious mindset can help develop innovation and stability in our businesses.

Risks & ChallengesThe biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by including the cost of mailing and shipping the signed copies into each pre-order tier. The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we ship the pre-order rewards to you as early as possible. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as to when my book will publish. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship. Other Ways You Can HelpSome people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:Please share my pre-sale campaign on Instagram, Facebook, and LinkedIn with your friends, family and network. Please use #Curiousbusinessowner and tag me as well as my publisher, New Degree Press, so that we can help amplify your efforts.You can easily share my pre-sale campaign via Indiegogo at the top of the page.Please share my book with 5 friends, family members, or co-workers who you think would enjoy it via text or direct message on social media.Thank you so much for of all of your love and support!Thanks again,Chris Arredondo",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div></div>","Short Summary My name is Nia King and I run a podcast called We Want the Airwaves where I interview queer and trans artists of color about their lives and their work. In 2014, I self-published a collection of these interviews called Queer & Trans Artists of Color: Stories of Some of Our Lives with co-editors Jessica Glennon-Zukoff and Terra Mikalson. Since summer of 2015, my new co-editor Elena Rose and I have been working on a second collection of interviews with QTPOC, and in October 2016 it will finally be finished. We are asking for your help to throw an amazing, accessible launch party, and go to Seattle, Portland, and LA!
The book is a self-published, do-it-yourself labor of love and we are booking the tour ourselves. All of our funding so far has come from individuals, mostly giving small donations of $5-$25. It means so much that you believe in us. Please help us continue the important work of documenting and sharing the words of living queer and trans artists of color by funding our West Coast book tour! 
    Here's how we're going to use the money.
  Hiring ASL interpreters for book launch party.
Paying artists. We'll be asking local queer and trans artists of color to perform with us in every city when we go on tour. We will pay all of them.

Food and gas to get us from place to place.
 Cheap hotels. Chronic pain makes sleeping on floors and couches really difficult.

<div><b>Excerpt from Angels and Avalon</b></div>
<div>
<p></p>
<p><i>Run.</i> Her feet struggled to comply with the
command her mind bellowed. Run! Heavy foot falls echoed behind her and
encouraged her forward. She darted into a side street and hoped it would not
dead-end. She had no idea where she was going. The new sensations in her feet
as they hit cobblestone caused her legs to jolt and jar uncomfortably. She
turned left and dodged a few people walking in the morning air. Not that there
was any air left in this retched place. She sped around another corner and
paused to listen for the steps of the guards over her pounding heart. A faint
echo from behind told her they were coming. The softer their foot falls, the
closer her mother’s guards were to catching their prey.</p>
<p>She ducked into an alley and curled up in
the shadows. She prayed, hoping against all odds that they would not find her.
Soon the foot falls grew silent and she feared the worst. She had heard from
the other prisoners in her mother’s dungeon that the guards whispered your name
before sealing your fate with a swift blade, if they were feeling merciful. She
wondered what it was they would whisper to her. She had no name. Would they be
merciful and swift or would they end her short existence slowly? </p>
<p>She hoped her inner-light, as her mother
had called it, would not betray her hiding place. She tried to rub soot all
over her exposed skin. The dark green dress her lady in waiting had stolen for
her covered most of her, but her neck, face, arms, and feet lay bare. Her skin
was pale like moonlight, glowing white with subtle, swirling pinks, greens and
blues just beneath the surface. Her hair could not make up its mind, changing
with the weather, her mood, or the light – flowing from chestnut to auburn,
auburn to the colors of fire, and fire to the color of straw and back again. It
was not her fault she was so bright. She would change if she could. She would
be like the others with their dark hair, grayed skin, and dark eyes. But she
was not and could not be like them. </p>
<p>Towers of smoke billowed from homes. Soot
fell, coating the bitter cold ground. If there was ever any color in this
world, surely the smoke and soot would have choked it out quickly. The
crumbling church steeple teetered like a gaping maw, ready to swallow up all
the light and joy in the world and spew darkness from its blackened depths. She
had heard other children talking about it as they sat outside the dungeon walls
to try and get a glimpse of her, the freakish daughter of the Queen. </p>
<p>The girl turned away from the sight of the
church and curled up closer to the wall. Her mother, had no other heir, but
would not pass on her throne to someone like her daughter. She was too soft,
too loving, too bright to rule over the type of court the Queen had built and
maintained: a court of darkness and pain. Six years in the darkness and shadows
of the dungeon, facing the demons, sorcerers and criminals her mother sent down
there had not chased the light from her eyes. She closed her eyes tightly to
hide their dancing colors. In the interest of her kingdom the Queen declared an
alternative heir, a distant male relative, and ordered her nameless daughter
killed so she could not try to claim the throne for herself. Fearing for her
life, she had escaped from the dungeons and now cowered in the corner of a
frigid dead-end.</p>
<p>It wasn’t long until the little nameless
girl lost all sensation from the cold. She may have cried, but her tears had
dried up long ago. Instead, she fell into a fitful, exhausted sleep hidden by
soot and darkness. She drifted in the bright world of dreams. The only place
she had ever felt she had belonged.</p>

A growing light surrounded her and pulled her from her
dreams. Her imaginings of trees and blue sky flew past her.  Beyond her dreams was a blinding white light.
She drifted there unable to move or speak. Terror flashed through her, but it
was chased away by a sense of warmth and safety. For the first time in her
life, the unfortunate girl felt safe enough to let go and sleep deeply.<br/><p><i>(...)</i></p>
<p><i>Adamina</i>, Goddess whispered,<i> Adamina, wake up child.</i></p>
<p>Lightning
snapped through the sky and thunder shook Adamina awake. The rain poured down
over the green hills. Fear and adrenaline filled her as she clambered to her
feet. She had to keep running. She ran down the hill and into a plain covered
in grass and clover slick with rain drops. Adamina’s eyes darted wildly,
searching for the inevitable arrival of … what. She couldn’t remember what she
was running from. The scent of lavender and lemon thyme filled her lungs,
causing her fear to ebb and her racing heart to slow slightly. A forest on the
other side of a plain came in view and Adamina jogged towards it. She tripped
over a tree root and fell. </p>
<p>Soil!
Fresh soil? No soil was left in her mother’s kingdom as far as she had known. Before
she had been given to the dungeons, the little nameless girl rode out on a
little brown pony in search of a patch of soil and seeds. Stories of trees and
forests, wildlife and plants beyond those few harvested in the soot-covered
fields ignited her curiosity. Digging in the ground all she had found was sand
and soot. The trees and flowers she had dreamed about would never be. And yet,
here they were in front of her very eyes.</p>
<p>Adamina
pulled herself up off the ground and looked around slowly. Trees clouded her
vision. The rhythm of rain drops sliding and bursting on leaves above her were
the only sounds she could hear.  Her
mouth gaped at the scene and she had to blink and rub her eyes several times
before she began to believe. Adamina realized that she was not cold. She had
always been cold. The new warmth caused her limbs to ache. The tempo of the rain
began to slow and she walked unhurriedly, taking in the forest, mentally
mapping exits and clearings as she came across them. </p>
<p>When
the sun began to peek through the clouds and the rain stopped, Adamina found
herself in a large clearing. The path that led her there had been made of fine
reddish and grey sand that clung to her feet. A small circular space was framed
by two stone benches. Adamina had never before seen so much sun, so much color
and life. She gaped in awe as her gaze stretch up and up over smooth stone.</p>
<p> A temple reached high above with pillars
taller than trees and four stone steps each nearly as tall as she was. Humming
began to fill her blood and urge her into the darkness past the doorway of the
temple. A small voice inside her heart answering her unspoken question told her
this place was called Avalon.</p>

She
remembered temples. Gods lived in temples. She climbed the large stone steps
until she faced the entrance. Inside was pitch black and silent. Adamina
stepped into the darkness. At first nothing happened, so Adamina kept moving
forward. Then she fell.<br/>

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p><i>Not THAT Rich </i>is a fictional drama-filled novel about a group of diverse teenagers struggling to find their identity in a highly pressurized affluent community.<br/><br/>My name is Belinda Lei and I am the author of <i>Not THAT Rich</i>. I wrote this book because, like many teenagers out there, high school was an immensely transformative experience for me, filled with all the angst, laughter, tears, and drama that makes your teenage years so formative. Through this book, I want to not only give readers an escape into a satirical and predominantly affluent Asian American community, but also lend my voice to young readers out there who might feel lost or invisible because of their racial, sexual, socioeconomic, or generational identity.<br/><br/>Siblings Hunter and Trisha Wang are smart, multi-talented, overachievers that have grown up embracing the dream of many families in the San Gabriel Valley - to one day attend one of the nation's top universities. They're also students at Winchester, one of the premier private high schools in the valley with a track record of sending all its primarily privileged and wealthy students into top tier colleges. As a senior, Hunter is laser-focused on submitting his Stanford college application, but an investigation into stolen AP exams, relationship struggles with the ""It"" girl, Sierra Jones, and the arrival of the son of a Chinese billionaire, Jack Zhou, and outsider, Ray Martinez, is about to flip the school year upside down for not just Hunter, but all the Winchester students. <br/><br/>You will enjoy this book if you are a fan of <i>Crazy Rich Asians, Never Have I Ever, or Gossip Girl</i>. Readers who want to escape into a very ""extra"" version of a wealthy, predominantly Asian American community will also love it.<br/><br/><i>Not THAT Rich</i> speaks to young adults and Asian Americans who want to grapple with college admissions and the pressures of family and status in a new way.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that <i>Not THAT Rich</i> takes readers through a dramatic, yet fun, story, but also inspires feelings of reflection, pressing into engaging questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>What does it mean to be Asian American today?</li>
<li>How do you find individuality amongst family and societal pressures?</li>
<li>Why is the college admissions process so skewed towards favoriting the wealthy and privileged?</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>I really look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. </p>

<h2><strong>Story of My Book</strong></h2>
<p>Yassen Knight knows he cannot be forgiven. After years of committing acts of high treason for the Arohassin, a criminal organization, his hands are numb with sin. But when an old, devious friend offers him a chance at redemption, Yassen takes it. He must journey back to the ancient Kingdom of Ravence where he had lost his family, and where the people have forsaken him.<br/><br/>But an old power awakens deep within the deserts of Ravence. A raging, unforgiving power that speaks of prophecy and annihilation. Its very existence threatens to unveil a closely guarded secret of the royal family. And it will stop at nothing to take back what it had claimed long ago.<br/><br/>The first of <i>The Ravence Trilogy, </i><i>The Boy With Fire</i> is a tale of a world teetering on the edge of war and prophecy, of fate and betrayal, of man’s irrevocable greed for power — and the sacrifices that must come with it.</p>

<p><br/>My name is Aparna Verma and I am the author of <i>The Boy With Fire</i>. Some stories arrive with such a force that they are impossible to ignore.

I want you to see this book as an opportunity to relish the power and beauty of magical realism, of unlimited imaginations, of myth and lore, and of the simple love for storytelling.<br/><br/>You will love this book if you’re a fan of sci-fi and fantasy, if you enjoy epic tales of lore, or if you are someone who believes in second chances.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that <i>The Boy with Fire</i> inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p>
<ol>
<li>What do we sacrifice in order to remain comfortable?</li>
<li>Who do we assign as scapegoats in our society?</li>
<li>Why do we believe in powers older and greater than us?</li>
</ol>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers.

Newton, MA.  This campaign is all about a book I made for my senior year project (CAPStone project) at NNHS and the impact it's had on my community.  It is a book of poetry and artwork that I wrote and designed myself.</p><p>    This past school year in Newton there have been three suicides among the high school community.  I have suffered from clinical depression and anxiety for many years as well as struggling with suicidality, so these recent events shook me to the core.  One of the girls was a friend of mine who sat three seats to my right in english class this year.  I had planned to take part in the CAPStone program since the spring of my junior year, but my project had seemed nebulous even to me up until this winter.  Before then I had wanted to write my own book, as I have been writing on my own for many years, but in my head there was no focus, message, or theme that could give any shape to my project.  I found my inspiration during our school's darkest time and decided to turn it into a light.</p><p>    This campaign has a couple central goals that I could use some help with.  The book already exists, so this is not about funding a hollow promise for something in the future.  This is about spreading a message of hope.  All I want is to be able to share my work and message with anyone and everyone who need to hear it, starting with my community and then spreading outward.  Your donations will go directly towards printing and disseminating my book, both to my supporters on Indiegogo and in Newton.  I used a service called ""Blurb"" to print my book personally, but I feel the cost is too high to ask the general public to pay.  A basic softcover copy costs about $40 to print, and that is not conducive to sharing in any meaningful way.  This is not about making money, this is about healing and spreading a message.  All of the money goes towards printing, and if you donate a certain amount half of it will go towards printing you a copy and the other half will print a copy for someone else.  I keep 0% of the donations.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p><br/></p><p>Ok so more in detail:</p><p>-My fundraising goal is $500.</p><p>-Everyone who donates $5 or more will receive a link to download the PDF version of my book.  The point of this perk is to share what I've done in the hope that you will in turn share it with the people in your life.  I want this to get out into the world and not just live in my computer or at my school, and you can help with that.  Keep it for yourself or share it with all your friends and family, do whatever you want it's as much yours as it is mine.</p><p>-Every other perk is designed so that it is just about double the cost it is to me to print physical copies of the book.  You will receive a copy in the mail and I will print another to send out to people in my community, the publishing world, those suffering from mental illness, and anyone else who wants or needs some hope.  I do not know at this point who specifically will be receiving each of the other copies, but I will let people know once I have a better idea.  The slight increase in the donation amount from the printing cost is to cover the shipping costs to make sure everyone receives their book sooner rather than later.</p><p>-Each book (soft cover, hard cover dust jacket, and hard cover image wrap) will be printed on premium paper for lasting quality and deep contrast in the images.</p><p>-If I do not reach my goal of $500 the money I have raised will still go towards printing however many books I can, and anyone who donated will still be guaranteed a copy (I promise!).</p><p>-If I somehow exceed my fundraising goal then nothing will change (except I will be off the walls with excitement), everyone will get their copy and I will simply print more books.</p><p><br/></p><p>***The book is 52 pages long, landscape orientation, length of 10 inches, height of 8 inches, professionally printed and bound using premium paper.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p><br/></p><p>    I will admit up front, I have never tried a project like this before.  That being said, I've committed the entire second half of my senior year in high school to making this book a reality, and I plan on continuing that devotion with this campaign.  For me, depression and suicide are two of the most tragic realities we face in our world today.  There has been lots of talk about excessive diagnosing and over-medicating and social stigma and the change that must occur, but few grassroots initiatives to truly make a change in how our society views mental illness.  This book is raw and emotional, that's the way I meant for it to be, but I believe that is what we need to even begin any sort of change.  My city lost three teenagers who had barely even started living their lives yet, and this is the best way I could conceive to honor them.  If you believe in life and you believe it is possible to heal, then please consider donating to this cause.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p><br/></p><p>Please also remember that if you feel you cannot donate, for whatever reason, you can still share this campaign with your friends and family.  Every little bit helps immensely!  Also remember to share the PDF freely and generously if you wish, the link will be good for anyone to download from if you choose to share it on social media or any website, blog, chat room, channel, or anything else on the internet!</p><p>Thank you everyone for just taking the time to read this!  I know it is a lot of text to look at.</p><p>(Just as a side note - my tumblr website link is not directly for my book, it is related mostly to the research

<p><em>“Jesus is my Hero, I am not a Christian.... Letting Go of Labels and Living From the Heart”</em> is a book for anyone interested in spiritual awakening.  With timeless content it empowers the reader to connect to the well of love that can only be found within. It is inspired reading for anyone interested in understanding the mind of Christ and how the principles that Jesus taught may be applied to daily life in order to find their own strength and authenticity in the human experience.</p>
<p>The objective of the book is to reach the many people who wish to connect to the Christ Consciousness, the path of non- judgment and unconditional love, whether they are Christian or not, in order to more fully realize their own Christ nature and enlivening the awareness of the One love that connects all humans.</p>
<p>The goal is to have the book completed and available to the world in January 2013. </p>
<p>How will these funds be used? </p>
<p>The funds will be used to self-publish copies of the book, and also to pay for editing, layout, publicity, and order fulfillment. We also intend to donate copies of the book to institutions such a prisons and addiction recovery programs.</p>

<p><strong>Why IndieGogo?</strong></p>
<p>I have been working with Kimberly Wright for several months.  While working with Kimberly, I volunteered to begin editing her book “Jesus is my Hero, I am not a Christian”. </p>
<p>Working with Kimberly has been such a powerful and life saving experience.  While reading the content of this book, I have had shifts in my life, in my own awakening and connection to the Christ Consciousness that are beyond what any words can describe. </p>
<p>Experiencing the impact of working with Kimberly Wright, and the power of this book, I can confidently say that reading this book will shift your life, wherever you are at, in the most amazing ways.  </p>
<p>This book must be published and available to the world, which is why I have created this fundraiser.  Your pledges are a significant contribution to this amazing piece of work, and thus also to the shift in humanity that is happening now.     </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is Christ Consciousness? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Excerpts from the book ""Jesus is my Hero, I am not a Christian""</strong></p>
<p>“The experience of Christ consciousness waking up is an experience that can only happen within the awareness and within the heart that is truly seeking to know the truth within.”</p>
<p>“Christ consciousness is the awareness of love in all beings and circumstances.  It sees no colors or wrong doing. It is the awareness of what is as perfection.  It is the awareness of love as the only thing that is real and as that which has created all that is for the purpose of awakening the One being that is all to itself.”</p>
<p>“Jesus was one of many who have come to be the embodiment of this message in the human form.  While he was not the only one, he was indeed the one that embodied the energy of the Christ Consciousness structure in order to bring it to modern day man and save the world from it's own destruction.”</p>
<p>“The Christ Consciousness can happen without the intention of giving one's life to Jesus. It can happen, through meditation and devotion to finding the truth within.  But devotion to God, and devotion to finding the truth within, <em>is</em> Christ Consciousness emerging in the seeker... whether they see it as that or not.  The CC does not seek to define the seeker by what means they arrive there. It receives any seeker who is genuine of heart and intention.  And in the structure of consciousness that we now refer to as Christ Consciousness many will eventually find themselves in relation with Jesus or with the other forms of Christ, such as Mother Mary, Kuan Yin or Buddha, all expressions of this consciousness.” </p>
<p>“When you are in Christ Consciousness you will see only love in all beings and in all circumstances.  Fear will melt away and love will prevail in your awareness.  Great love swells the heart as it breaths in the awareness of the Universal heart, knowing and feeling and experiencing the Oneness of all, the greatest love there is.”</p>
<p>The Christ consciousness is the aspect of the collective universal consciousness that is centered in the heart that is awake to love, or light, in all beings, reaching beyond all boundaries related to the material world such as race or religion. In Christ consciousness all paths and all humans are equal and created in love. In realizing the Christ consciousness through awakening the individual, then experiences the unity of himself with all other beings, recognizing as well that all creation exists within one's own consciousness, and the result is a life of grace, ease, and unconditional love for all. One recognizes there is only love in all circumstances.  The essence of this path is grace.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>You are invited to join the awakening of the Christ within the collective through your active choice that you will now begin to wake up to this in your own life.</strong> </p>
<p>It does not matter what religion you practice, or don't practice. It matters only that you make the choice each day to know the truth from within you – that you actively choose this is all that matters. That choice, your determination to know the truth, within yourself, for yourself, by your own path of choice – THAT is the path of Christ. It is a path of following only what speaks true to your heart in the moment. It is the path of the individual who wants answers, but not from books or dogma or doctrine of the world. Those things may inspire at best, but the real work is done internally, through intention, choice and a dedication to knowing the truth by no other means than this. </p>
<p>As for the great love that is available in the Christ consciousness, please don't take my word for it.   Find out for yourself. Decide to know the truth. All you have to do is ask.   And in the mire of the current collective energetic structures and paradigms that currently exist in the world and therefore in the mind of most humans, there is a need to be diligent in this intention.  It has to be a priority on your list.  Otherwise you will find yourself living a life on auto pilot, caught in the mire, and wondering what's missing, or why you can't seem to make the law of attraction work for you.  How can you make the law of attraction work for you when you are 99% asleep to who you really are?</p>

“Jesus is my Hero, I am not a Christian.... Letting Go of Labels and Living From the Heart” is a book for anyone interested in spiritual awakening.  With timeless content it empowers the reader to connect to the well of love that can only be found within. It is inspired reading for anyone interested in understanding the mind of Christ and how the principles that Jesus taught may be applied to daily life in order to find their own strength and authenticity in the human experience.
The objective of the book is to reach the many people who wish to connect to the Christ Consciousness, the path of non- judgment and unconditional love, whether they are Christian or not, in order to more fully realize their own Christ nature and enlivening the awareness of the One love that connects all humans.
The goal is to have the book completed and available to the world in January 2013. 
How will these funds be used? 
The funds will be used to self-publish copies of the book, and also to pay for editing, layout, publicity, and order fulfillment. We also intend to donate copies of the book to institutions such a prisons and addiction recovery programs.

Why IndieGogo?
I have been working with Kimberly Wright for several months.  While working with Kimberly, I volunteered to begin editing her book “Jesus is my Hero, I am not a Christian”. 
Working with Kimberly has been such a powerful and life saving experience.  While reading the content of this book, I have had shifts in my life, in my own awakening and connection to the Christ Consciousness that are beyond what any words can describe. 
Experiencing the impact of working with Kimberly Wright, and the power of this book, I can confidently say that reading this book will shift your life, wherever you are at, in the most amazing ways.  
This book must be published and available to the world, which is why I have created this fundraiser.  Your pledges are a significant contribution to this amazing piece of work, and thus also to the shift in humanity that is happening now.     
 
What is Christ Consciousness? 
Excerpts from the book ""Jesus is my Hero, I am not a Christian""
“The experience of Christ consciousness waking up is an experience that can only happen within the awareness and within the heart that is truly seeking to know the truth within.”
“Christ consciousness is the awareness of love in all beings and circumstances.  It sees no colors or wrong doing. It is the awareness of what is as perfection.  It is the awareness of love as the only thing that is real and as that which has created all that is for the purpose of awakening the One being that is all to itself.”
“Jesus was one of many who have come to be the embodiment of this message in the human form.  While he was not the only one, he was indeed the one that embodied the energy of the Christ Consciousness structure in order to bring it to modern day man and save the world from it's own destruction.”
“The Christ Consciousness can happen without the intention of giving one's life to Jesus. It can happen, through meditation and devotion to finding the truth within.  But devotion to God, and devotion to finding the truth within, is Christ Consciousness emerging in the seeker... whether they see it as that or not.  The CC does not seek to define the seeker by what means they arrive there. It receives any seeker who is genuine of heart and intention.  And in the structure of consciousness that we now refer to as Christ Consciousness many will eventually find themselves in relation with Jesus or with the other forms of Christ, such as Mother Mary, Kuan Yin or Buddha, all expressions of this consciousness.” 
“When you are in Christ Consciousness you will see only love in all beings and in all circumstances.  Fear will melt away and love will prevail in your awareness.  Great love swells the heart as it breaths in the awareness of the Universal heart, knowing and feeling and experiencing the Oneness of all, the greatest love there is.”
The Christ consciousness is the aspect of the collective universal consciousness that is centered in the heart that is awake to love, or light, in all beings, reaching beyond all boundaries related to the material world such as race or religion. In Christ consciousness all paths and all humans are equal and created in love. In realizing the Christ consciousness through awakening the individual, then experiences the unity of himself with all other beings, recognizing as well that all creation exists within one's own consciousness, and the result is a life of grace, ease, and unconditional love for all. One recognizes there is only love in all circumstances.  The essence of this path is grace. 
You are invited to join the awakening of the Christ within the collective through your active choice that you will now begin to wake up to this in your own life. 
It does not matter what religion you practice, or don't practice. It matters only that you make the choice each day to know the truth from within you – that you actively choose this is all that matters. That choice, your determination to know the truth, within yourself, for yourself, by your own path of choice – THAT is the path of Christ. It is a path of following only what speaks true to your heart in the moment. It is the path of the individual who wants answers, but not from books or dogma or doctrine of the world. Those things may inspire at best, but the real work is done internally, through intention, choice and a dedication to knowing the truth by no other means than this. 
As for the great love that is available in the Christ consciousness, please don't take my word for it.   Find out for yourself. Decide to know the truth. All you have to do is ask.   And in the mire of the current collective energetic structures and paradigms that currently exist in the world and therefore in the mind of most humans, there is a need to be diligent in this intention.  It has to be a priority on your list.  Otherwise you will find yourself living a life on auto pilot, caught in the mire, and wondering what's missing, or why you can't seem to make the law of attraction work for you.  How can you make the law of attraction work for you when you are 99% asleep to who you really are?

<div> <p></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Today, a significant gap exists between literary
publishers and strictly religious publishers. Literary publishers occasionally
publish books of spiritual depth, but few, if any, set out to do so as a
mission and raison d’être. Religious publishers, on the other hand, tend to
publish work that offers little appeal to readers outside a particular ideological
group. Orison Books, a new non-profit (501(c)(3)) literary press, aims to
address this gap through its focus on the life of the spirit from a
non-ideological standpoint. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We are conducting a fundraiser to enable a
successful launch. Through behind-the-scenes efforts, Orison Books initially raised $6,500, which allowed us to incorporate, apply for tax exemption with the IRS, and create a logo and website. Our goal is to raise an additional $40,000 to enable us to begin publishing books in early 2015.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">“Orison” [awr-uh-zuhn] is an archaic word that means
“prayer.” We at Orison Books believe that the best spiritual art and literature
call us to meditate and contemplate, rather than asking us to adopt any
ideology or set of propositions.  As
Simone Weil wrote, “The mysteries of faith are degraded if they are made into
an object of affirmation and negation, when in reality they should be an object
of contemplation” (<i>Gravity and Grace</i>). This type of art evokes the human
experience of transcendence and explores the mysteries of being, and in so
doing opens our minds and hearts to the divine and the possibility of becoming
the fullest humans we can be. In our view, spiritual writing has little to do
with subject matter. Rather, the kind of work we seek to publish has a transcendent
aesthetic effect on the reader, and reading it can itself be a spiritual
experience. Such work is not merely about spiritual contemplation, but itself
leads the reader into profound contemplation. It is not merely about the
sublime, but itself has a sublime effect on the reader. It is not merely about
the mystery of being, but itself heightens the reader’s sense of the mystery
underlying the fabric of our daily lives.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Orison Books will serve as a home for writers and readers
of all backgrounds, religious and non-religious. In addition to publishing spiritually-engaged
poetry, fiction, and non-fiction books of exceptional literary merit, each year
we will publish <i>The Orison Anthology</i>—a collection of the best spiritual writing
in all genres published in periodicals the preceding year.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Our titles will be released in beautifully-designed hardcover and paperback formats, and many will also be released as e-books.<br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Additionally, Orison Books aims to contribute to the
cultural conversations around spirituality and literature by hosting classes, readings, symposia, and other public events.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We cannot succeed without the contributions of those who
support our mission of publishing exceptional literature that engages the life
of the spirit, and of fostering cultural conversation around spirituality and literature. Please consider making a tax-deductible contribution today.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Since Orison Books is a non-profit, Indiegogo does not require us to reach our goal in order for us to collect donated funds.

If we raise more than is necessary for that, then we will be able to more quickly acquire and release additional titles and plan public events. If we reach our $40,000 goal, we have budgeted for a small salary for the Editor in order to allow him to create the time necessary for shepherding Orison Books into a successful and impactful future. (This will be more than a full-time job!) So, even if you're able to donate $10, or $50, or $250, it will support the mission of Orison Books, and our promise to you is that we will use all funds raised in a responsible and thoughtful way, always in order to further our mission of publishing the finest new spiritually-engaged literature, and promoting cultural conversation around spirituality and literature. Thank you for any support you're able to offer. And if you're unable to support us monetarily but you feel compelled by our mission, please consider helping spread the word about our fundraising effort, which is a vital aspect of any fundraising campaign. <br/></p>

<h3>Our First Title</h3>

<p><i><b>I Scrape The Window of Nothingness: <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">New &amp; Selected Poems</span></b></i></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">“Stella Vinitchi Radulescu’s poems are rich in connotations, metaphysically profound in some great unlocatable fashion. Surreal, ethereal, some of the poems enact ghostly things, and a very powerful world view glitters and solidifies…. <b>It’s a dark poetry shining with the ecstasy of the imagination let loose, a triumph of being, a war against banality</b>.” </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><u>—David Dodd Lee, author of <i>The Nervous Filaments</i></u><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">""Daunting to even try to put into a few words a <b>poetry that is <i>sui generis</i>, whose moving language of images, displaced from any single set of cultural signs, seems the distillation of a thousand occasions, a legion of losses—a universal language 'at the edge of spoken time,' a vision 'wildly sad, diffused, beautiful, a tactile absence.' </b>In this poetry of passionate paradox, embodied thought becomes the solid clarity through which what we can’t see is glimpsed.""            </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><u>—Eleanor Wilner, MacArthur Fellow and author of <i>Tourist in Hell</i></u><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">""<b>Stella
Vinitchi Radulescu’s poetry irradiates, like a magnetic field charged with mysteries</b>,<b>
the movements and the rituals of her bright vision.</b> One of the strongest
characteristics of her poems consists in the unabridged relationship she
establishes with words, a pact that sends us to their origins. The poet dares
to carry the shadow of her own loneliness, keeping pace with that of her words,
up to the line of a horizon where sky and earth, life and death merge."" </p>

Overview
 
Today, a significant gap exists between literary
publishers and strictly religious publishers. Literary publishers occasionally
publish books of spiritual depth, but few, if any, set out to do so as a
mission and raison d’être. Religious publishers, on the other hand, tend to
publish work that offers little appeal to readers outside a particular ideological
group. Orison Books, a new non-profit (501(c)(3)) literary press, aims to
address this gap through its focus on the life of the spirit from a
non-ideological standpoint. 
We are conducting a fundraiser to enable a
successful launch. Through behind-the-scenes efforts, Orison Books initially raised $6,500, which allowed us to incorporate, apply for tax exemption with the IRS, and create a logo and website. Our goal is to raise an additional $40,000 to enable us to begin publishing books in early 2015.
“Orison” [awr-uh-zuhn] is an archaic word that means
“prayer.” We at Orison Books believe that the best spiritual art and literature
call us to meditate and contemplate, rather than asking us to adopt any
ideology or set of propositions.  As
Simone Weil wrote, “The mysteries of faith are degraded if they are made into
an object of affirmation and negation, when in reality they should be an object
of contemplation” (Gravity and Grace). This type of art evokes the human
experience of transcendence and explores the mysteries of being, and in so
doing opens our minds and hearts to the divine and the possibility of becoming
the fullest humans we can be. In our view, spiritual writing has little to do
with subject matter. Rather, the kind of work we seek to publish has a transcendent
aesthetic effect on the reader, and reading it can itself be a spiritual
experience. Such work is not merely about spiritual contemplation, but itself
leads the reader into profound contemplation. It is not merely about the
sublime, but itself has a sublime effect on the reader. It is not merely about
the mystery of being, but itself heightens the reader’s sense of the mystery
underlying the fabric of our daily lives.
Orison Books will serve as a home for writers and readers
of all backgrounds, religious and non-religious. In addition to publishing spiritually-engaged
poetry, fiction, and non-fiction books of exceptional literary merit, each year
we will publish The Orison Anthology—a collection of the best spiritual writing
in all genres published in periodicals the preceding year.
Our titles will be released in beautifully-designed hardcover and paperback formats, and many will also be released as e-books.
Additionally, Orison Books aims to contribute to the
cultural conversations around spirituality and literature by hosting classes, readings, symposia, and other public events.

We cannot succeed without the contributions of those who
support our mission of publishing exceptional literature that engages the life
of the spirit, and of fostering cultural conversation around spirituality and literature. Please consider making a tax-deductible contribution today.
Since Orison Books is a non-profit, Indiegogo does not require us to reach our goal in order for us to collect donated funds. All funds are collected in real time, and we at Orison will use whatever amount we're able to raise first of all on expenses related to releasing and promoting our first title. If we raise more than is necessary for that, then we will be able to more quickly acquire and release additional titles and plan public events. If we reach our $40,000 goal, we have budgeted for a small salary for the Editor in order to allow him to create the time necessary for shepherding Orison Books into a successful and impactful future. (This will be more than a full-time job!) So, even if you're able to donate $10, or $50, or $250, it will support the mission of Orison Books, and our promise to you is that we will use all funds raised in a responsible and thoughtful way, always in order to further our mission of publishing the finest new spiritually-engaged literature, and promoting cultural conversation around spirituality and literature. Thank you for any support you're able to offer. And if you're unable to support us monetarily but you feel compelled by our mission, please consider helping spread the word about our fundraising effort, which is a vital aspect of any fundraising campaign.

Our First Title
Orison Books is pleased to announce its first title:
I Scrape The Window of Nothingness: New & Selected Poems
by Stella Vinitchi Radulescu

Release date: March, 2015
“Stella Vinitchi Radulescu’s poems are rich in connotations, metaphysically profound in some great unlocatable fashion. Surreal, ethereal, some of the poems enact ghostly things, and a very powerful world view glitters and solidifies…. It’s a dark poetry shining with the ecstasy of the imagination let loose, a triumph of being, a war against banality.” 
—David Dodd Lee, author of The Nervous Filaments

""Daunting to even try to put into a few words a poetry that is sui generis, whose moving language of images, displaced from any single set of cultural signs, seems the distillation of a thousand occasions, a legion of losses—a universal language 'at the edge of spoken time,' a vision 'wildly sad, diffused, beautiful, a tactile absence.' In this poetry of passionate paradox, embodied thought becomes the solid clarity through which what we can’t see is glimpsed.""            
—Eleanor Wilner, MacArthur Fellow and author of Tourist in Hell
""Stella
Vinitchi Radulescu’s poetry irradiates, like a magnetic field charged with mysteries,
the movements and the rituals of her bright vision. One of the strongest
characteristics of her poems consists in the unabridged relationship she
establishes with words, a pact that sends us to their origins. The poet dares
to carry the shadow of her own loneliness, keeping pace with that of her words,
up to the line of a horizon where sky and earth, life and death merge."" 
—Alexandru Lungu, editor of Zarathustra and Argo

""With constancy and felicity Stella Vinitchi Radulescu pursues her poetic course in a pertinent and already important trilingual oeuvre. [. . .] She remains faithful to a certain hermeticism that
breathes more force into her work, whose mysterious form beats with the rhythm
of life."" 
—Michel Bénard, laureate of l’Académie Française and Chevalier de l’Ordre des Arts & des Lettres

About the Author: Stella Vinitchi Radulescu was born in Romania in 1946 and left the country permanently in 1983, at the height of Ceausescu’s communist regime. She holds a Ph.D. in French Language & Literature from the University of Bucharest. Since 1989, she has taught French, first at Loyola University, and subsequently at Northwestern University. She writes poetry in English, French, and Romanian and is the author of numerous collections of poetry published in the United States, France, and Romania. She has received several prizes for her French books, including the Grand Prix de Poésie Henri-Noël Villard and the Prix Amélie Murat. I Scrape the Window of Nothingness: New & Selected Poems is a collection of work selected from Radulescu's English-language poetry published over several decades, along with a substantial collection of previously unpublished work.",6.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<li>
<i><b>For the Sake of the Song: </b></i>Kelley Hunt and Caryn Mirriam-Goldberg were brought together in 2004 to write a song. Neither of us have been the same since! We experienced such thrills and joy in creating songs together that we've gone on to write over 30 songs, some of which Kelley has recorded and performed around the world.</li>
<li>
<i><b>When Music and Poetry Meet: </b></i>For the last eight years, we have created performances that join song, poetry, and even on occasion, dance. Each performance focuses on a theme close to the hearts of our community, such as healing through the arts, redefining beauty, coming home to the soul, and connecting with community, earth and sky. </li>
<li>
<b><i>Finding Our Brave Voice: </i></b>Since 2006, we've co-led ""Brave Voice: Writing &amp; Singing For Your Life"" 6-day workshops in the Flint Hills of Kansas, helping professional and emerging writers, musicians, singers, songwriters, artists, educators and others find new art, right livelihood, and enduring community.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<i><b>This Campaign: </b></i>We ask you to support 1) the creation of new songs and poems, which we will perform with dancer Laura Ramberg in Lawrence, Council Grove and other venues in 2014; and 2) the scholarship fund for Brave Voice.<br/>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><b>Our Fundraising Plan: </b>We ultimately are raising $4,000 ($1,500 for creation of new work; $2,500 for scholarships to Brave Voice), $2,500 of which will be raised through this Indiegogo campaign:<br/></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b><i>Scholarship Funds: </i></b>Help support up to five people attending the event, which costs approximately $700/participant for room, board, and the workshop. We meet you part-way by lowering fees for scholarship recipients.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<i><b>New Work Fund: </b></i>Support our work together unearthing or catching new songs, developing the lyrics and music, Kelley arranging each song, Caryn creating new poetry -- all toward a collaborative performance that also features Laura Ramberg.<br/>

they created for our local artists was expansive. They brought participants to a new level of expression, allowing

<br/>Perks &amp; Quirks</h3><ul>
<li>I'd love for you to pre-buy a book or two (or seven)! If you're new to IndieGoGo, you simply get books and/or other perks based on your contributions. I've got oh-oh-7 perks to choose from including proof books, signed books, your name in the books as a contributor, a unique Caribbean cruise and tickets to my latest spy fan event, <a href=""http://bondfanevents.com/leans/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Live and Let 'Leans</a>.
 I've written or edited over a million words about James Bond and entertained more
 than 120 actors, authors and film production team members, along with 
intelligence officers (spies!) from the FBI, CIA, NSA and KGB at my fan events, and have appeared on C-SPAN, DISCOVERY, 
HGTV, VH-1, TLC, TNN and in <i><em><em><i>Ripley's Believe It or Not!</i></em></em></i>,<em><i>The Chicago Tribune</i>, <i>The Los Angeles Times</i></em>, <em><i>The New York Times</i>, <i>The Washington Post</i>, <i>Parade Magazine</i>, <i>Time</i> </em>and<i><em><em><i>Time Europe</i></em></em></i>.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>While donations of any amount are appreciated, what happens if I get over funded past the $20,000 book goal? Can you say, <i>""Double Jeroboams of Dom Pérignon '53?""</i>
 Actually, it means more people get to learn how to eat like Bond!<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>What happens if the $20,000 goal isn't reached? I pledge I<i><b> </b></i>will honor all perks even if funding falls short. Everyone donating $25 or more receives a glossy <b>100% FULL COLOR BOOK INSIDE AND OUT</b>. This even if the color version in print costs over $25 in stores. The free world is counting on your contributions, Mr. and Mrs. Bond!</li>
</ul><br/><h3>Sudden Impact</h3><p>IndieGoGo makes a difference:</p><ul>
<li>Why a book on every last meal in every OO7 book and film? Because nothing of importance happens to Bond without food or drink nearby. He proposes marriage in a restaurant, meets villains over dining tables, drinks before he kills and steals caviar, vodka or a grape after a melee. A Bond movie has 20 food, drinking and eating scenes and a villain eating from a massive table laden with silver, crystal and gold. A Bond novel details 20-40 meals or more. Ian Fleming's novels grew world famous for their travelogues including exotic, gourmet and just plain delicious food.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>Please help me get lush <b>full color</b> printing on each and every page to the public. Filet
 mignon and lobster look better not printed in grayscale. Money raised from book sales and perks add to professional photography, layout and advertising.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>Help <i><b>Eating James Bond</b></i> look as sharp as possible with modern, clean illustrations and publishing, and please help me get word out with advertising and samples to tell the world what a cool book this will be.<br/><br/>
</li>

Perks & Quirks
I'd love for you to pre-buy a book or two (or seven)! If you're new to IndieGoGo, you simply get books and/or other perks based on your contributions. I've got oh-oh-7 perks to choose from including proof books, signed books, your name in the books as a contributor, a unique Caribbean cruise and tickets to my latest spy fan event, Live and Let 'Leans.
 I've written or edited over a million words about James Bond and entertained more
 than 120 actors, authors and film production team members, along with 
intelligence officers (spies!) from the FBI, CIA, NSA and KGB at my fan events, and have appeared on C-SPAN, DISCOVERY, 
HGTV, VH-1, TLC, TNN and in Ripley's Believe It or Not!,The Chicago Tribune, The Los Angeles Times, The New York Times, The Washington Post, Parade Magazine, Time andTime Europe.

While donations of any amount are appreciated, what happens if I get over funded past the $20,000 book goal? Can you say, ""Double Jeroboams of Dom Pérignon '53?""
 Actually, it means more people get to learn how to eat like Bond!

What happens if the $20,000 goal isn't reached? I pledge I will honor all perks even if funding falls short. Everyone donating $25 or more receives a glossy 100% FULL COLOR BOOK INSIDE AND OUT. This even if the color version in print costs over $25 in stores. The free world is counting on your contributions, Mr. and Mrs. Bond!
Sudden ImpactIndieGoGo makes a difference:
Why a book on every last meal in every OO7 book and film? Because nothing of importance happens to Bond without food or drink nearby. He proposes marriage in a restaurant, meets villains over dining tables, drinks before he kills and steals caviar, vodka or a grape after a melee. A Bond movie has 20 food, drinking and eating scenes and a villain eating from a massive table laden with silver, crystal and gold. A Bond novel details 20-40 meals or more. Ian Fleming's novels grew world famous for their travelogues including exotic, gourmet and just plain delicious food.

Please help me get lush full color printing on each and every page to the public. Filet
 mignon and lobster look better not printed in grayscale. Money raised from book sales and perks add to professional photography, layout and advertising.

Help Eating James Bond look as sharp as possible with modern, clean illustrations and publishing, and please help me get word out with advertising and samples to tell the world what a cool book this will be.

Thanks for using IndieGoGo tools and social media to get Eating James Bond to friends (and enemies). Please help me finish this fattening book!

I now have the opportunity to edit and revise my memoir in a residency with a master writer at VONA’s summer workshops.  </p>
<p>I’ve been cocooned for many months writing my memoir. The venture began over a decade ago when I first put it out into the ether that I wanted to, had to write a pentagonia (five part series) of memoirs. I had to share the story of this girl, raised in Bushwick by two moms long before the lifestyle was discussed in the mainstream, other than to curl lips in disgust and rail about how unnatural it is. I had to share how it felt to be raised by a mentally ill parent. I had to share the story of how and why I left my mother’s home when I was thirteen and never returned. I had to share what happened to me in boarding school, when I realized that I was “the other,” the time a lit cigarette was thrown from a passing truck at me and my St. Lucian friend, followed by the words, “Nigg*s, go home.” I had to share how I ended up with a drug dealer for six years while a student at Columbia University, and how as a result of that relationship, I emotionally incarcerated myself for more than ten years in a desperate attempt to protect my heart (of course I ended up doing more damage to myself than anyone could.) But it’s in the writing that you realize all these things, and that’s what the past decade+ of writing has helped me see. It wasn’t until I went to VONA in 2009 that I really started believing that my stories do indeed matter and should be, need to be heard. In a word, VONA gave me permission.</p>
<p>There was a time when I resisted the stories that cracked my spine, bent me over into impossible positions. I'm not that limber. There is no human who is. It's why it's taken me over a decade to work through this first memoir. I was on my knees; now I'm on my tippy toes showing the world how tall 5 feet 2 inches can be.</p>
<p>In January, after feeling stuck because I couldn’t find the thread in the dozens of stories, something shook loose after a grueling, what-are-you-afraid-of-kind-of conversation. I realized that this book is about my relationship with my mother and what happened that I left at 13. Once I had that, I went in because I’m from the school of: the only way out is in. I knew the first story and I knew the last. I gathered those I had in the middle and started filling in the gaps. And that is why and how today I am now compiling the stories that surfaced in my nightly ritual writing process.</p>
<p>I can feel the book in my hands. I can see the chapters. I can feel my fingers caressing it. I can see the epigraph and the quotes that start the chapters. I can see it all, for the first time in this years-long memoir process, I can finally see the first of the pentagonia.</p>
<p>And now I have an opportunity to have a master writer work through the book with me, help me see where it is strong and where it is weak, help me see the book in its entirety. The thing is, as a teaching artist who quit her job two years ago to work with urban youth, I cannot afford to go to VONA on my current income. I need help. And if there’s anything I’ve learned from memoir, it’s that I have to humble myself and learn to ask for help and accept it when I need it. So I need it now. And so, I’m asking that you help me raise $2000 to attend VONA.</p>
<p>The fees include $700 for the residency + $650 for housing + airfare (which last time I checked was about $550) and all the particulars like cab fare and luggage fees.</p>

<p>- I'm a big fan of jewelry, plushies, and other random swag.</p>
<p>- Giftcards!</p>

<p>I'm also looking for street team volunteers!

<p>Promo. Promo. Promo. (also expensive! This is also about $200 if I'm going to get good quality stuff)</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>What's in it for you?</p>

However, it would mean the world to me to be able to do this and give back to everyone who's working so hard to make this happen. I want to pay it forward, pay it back.

A New Adult, Science Fiction, Adventure novel like no other.
Chevelle Donahue thought going into work would be just like any other boring day at the mall. Sure, there was her annoying co-worker Wicken Lyle, and a promotional visit from teen hearth-throb Timber Hudson to watch to keep her entertained. But who was she kidding? Retail was lame no matter what happened.
A terrorist attack changes everything - an attack from aliens of all things. The patrons are given two options: comply, or else. Complying means giving in to a new set of rules and changing her entire life. ""Or else"" means she has no chance of going home again.
With the help of Wicken and Timber, she must figure out the truth behind why the aliens are holding them hostage. In doing so, they risk their chance at freedom - but by then they might not want it.

<p><strong>Once upon a time…</strong></p>
<p>Once upon a time, there was a series of books that took young readers on exciting adventures. What made these books truly special was the fact they let readers make choices about how their stories would unfold. And if their tales ended in sadness or tragedy, the readers could go back to any point in the story and do things differently. </p>
<p>Decades later, in another land, there was a young woman who often found herself distraught when it came to matters of the heart. And like many before her, she turned to the written word for help in avoiding heartbreak. </p>
<p>She soon found herself overwhelmed with the sundry of books and articles promising magical elixirs to cure her romantic ailments. There were so many rules. So many do’s. So many don’ts. So many contradictory and outdated opinions. How was she to keep everything straight, let alone apply it to her own, unique life?</p>
<p>And then one day, fate waved its magic wand and inspired the young woman to combine her favourite childhood stories with the advice books of her adulthood. The result was enchanting. </p>
<p>The reader could make her own decisions about her romantic future.  If she should make mistakes, she would start over again. It would offer true-to-life dating dilemmas. It would represent the varied wants and desires of the modern woman.  There would be pop culture references, sex, and shenanigans. Hilarity would ensue.</p>
<p>And <em>Coulda, Woulda, Shoulda</em> was born.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 180px;""><img alt=""Hannah"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/693069/pictures/original/20130306100306-Hanna-03.jpg?1362592985"" src="""" style="""" title=""Hannah""/></p>
<p><strong>Present day…</strong></p>
<p>As you may have gleaned from the fairytale above, I am that young woman from the far off land (of Toronto, Canada).</p>
<p>I, Tara Reed, hereby announce to the world that I have read my share of dating advice books. I’m betting you have, too. At least one. Come on. You’ve got a copy of <em>He’s Just Not That Into You.</em> Admit it. Just between us girls? <em>I knew it!</em></p>
<p>So you know as well as I do that some dating advice sends our love soaring to new altitudes, while some of it leaves us searching for the relationship black box, desperate to know where it all went wrong. Why is that? It’s because we’re all different. Male or female, each of us is the sum total our unique experiences, which dictate our choices in all areas of our lives.</p>
<p>Even if we don’t actively look to books, magazines, friends, or tarot cards for advice, it finds us. Social circles, officemates, and know-it-all relatives desperate for us to have babies, frequently have something to say.  We even get it subliminally through music, TV and movies. (Yeah, yeah. Romantic comedies are the root of all evil and Rachel McAdams is the incredibly beautiful devil.  We get it.) All of this contributes to the time-honoured tradition known as “playing games.”</p>
<p><em>We all do it. </em>For every girl wondering why a guy hasn’t called her after a great date, there’s a guy discouraging his buddy from calling a girl so he can keep the upper hand.</p>
<p>That's never going to change.  Ever. Of course, that doesn’t mean we have to take dating too seriously or transport ourselves to the 1950s in search of some mysterious quality supposed to help us catch and keep a man. We don’t even have to <em>want </em>to keep a man. Hear us roar!</p>
<p>You should seek out all the advice your heart desires, but it’s important to heed only the advice that sounds right for <em>you</em>, and to make choices that are going to make <em>you </em>happy - whatever happy looks like to <em>you</em>. See a theme? Whether you want to marry (or not), have kids (or not), juggle two guys at a time (or <em>at once), </em>it should be fun, right?</p>
<p>So where to start? Hmm. <em>Oh!</em> Hey! I know. You could help me fund the production of my awesome novel, <em>Coulda, Woulda, Shoulda, </em>which I'm hoping to publish by September of this year.</p>
<p><strong><em>Tell me more!</em></strong></p>
<p>Whether you think you're a dating disaster or a certified courtship champion, <em>Coulda, Woulda Shoulda</em> offers you a fun platform to test your technique throughout hundreds of true-to-life dating scenarios and over 60 different endings. Stepping into the role of Hannah, you’ll have to carefully balance your heart and your head to maneuver your relationship from frisky Friday nights to plans for a June wedding. If you want to get married, that is.   </p>
<p>It doesn’t matter if you’ve read <em>all </em>the books, or none of them.  Why?  Because while it was inspired by countless books like <em>The Rules</em> and <em>He’s Just Not That Into You</em>, this is <em>not</em> an advice book.  It doesn’t matter if you’re an old-fashioned gal or a true-feminista, this novel has something for you! You’ll also have great friends, Rachel and Valerie, who put the antics in romantics, and are always ready to help you get out of, and into, guy trouble.</p>
<p>How will you handle your first fight? What do you do about his way-too-close-and-attractive-for-your-liking gal pal? What do you say when he suggests the dreaded threesome? What’s a girl to do about that cute, charming guy she keeps running into who won’t take no for an answer? How about when you’re faced with unexpected pregnancies, suspicious behaviour, those three biggest of little words, and the minefield that is the topic of marriage? I don’t know what you’ll do, but I do know that you’ll always have a choice, and a chance to start over if you fall flat on your face. And you don’t even have to put on make up to do it.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 180px;""><img alt=""Rachel"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/693071/pictures/original/20130306100337-Rachael-02.jpg?1362593016"" src="""" style="""" title=""Rachel""/></p>
<p><strong>Okay. Neat-O idea, Tara, but why should <em>you </em>write it?</strong></p>
<p>What qualifies me to write this book? Other than the fact I did? I’m <span style=""text-decoration: line-through;"">just</span> kinda like you!  I’m a hapless romantic. I’ve been guilty of premature infatuation.  I’ve juggled candlelit dinners and clandestine meetings. I’m really more of a dating <em>in</em>expert - who just happens to be a pretty good writer. I also spent a ludicrous amount of time reading all the dating and relationship books and articles I could get my hands on to make the content in the book as comprehensive as possible.</p>
<p>I’m no longer a single gal, but my guy (who you might recognize from such films as the video for this campaign) appears on the covers of 75 <em>Harlequin </em>romance novels, so that’s kind of like a rom-com, right?   </p>
<p><strong>Go on…</strong></p>
<p>I spent 10 years working in public relations, writing for and promoting everything from video games to shoes to dolls - including one particularly well-known plastic blonde!  Unfortunately, I was forced to stop working five years ago when I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia.  So in between doctor’s appointments, side effects and treatments, I chipped away at this book a little bit a time to keep myself sane. It soon took on a life of its own, and hopefully will provide me with the means to support myself in the future.<br/><br/>I’ve also published many columns on consumer technology in SNAP, a Toronto-based newspaper, and studied improvisation with <em>The Second City</em> here in Toronto. I also not-so-secretly wish I were a <em>Muppet</em>, I’m a Gemini, and I like short walks on the beach.</p>
<p><strong>Why self-publish?<br/></strong><br/>The completion of the original manuscript coincided with the lowest point of the recent financial crisis. After querying a group of agents, I received wonderful responses to the story and the fresh concept. Unfortunately, and understandably, the economy and unpredictable fiction market made taking on debut authors with niche projects challenging for agents. However, a handful of them encouraged me to leverage my PR expertise and publish it myself, and I am so grateful to them. </p>
<p><strong>And if I help you raise all that money?</strong><br/><br/>First, I suspect you would be handsomely rewarded by Karma - she loves love and when people get to fulfill their dreams (but no pressure!). Mostly, you’d be helping me launch this book with the full integrity of a traditionally published novel.   <br/><br/>That means professional editing, formatting, and cover design, and a kick-ass, interactive website. Let me emphasize the word “professional” here. I’ve got a great team of talented colleagues who are ready to put in the work (as soon as I can pay them).<br/><br/>What’s more? Aside of from the book in multiple formats, you could score some sweet extras, like official temporary tattoos, a place in the book's acknowledgements or have a character named after you. You can find a full list of perks to the right of the screen.</p>
<p>I'm working with financial expert, <a href=""http://shannonleesimmons.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Shannon Lee Simmons"">Shannon Lee Simmons</a> to make sure funds are distributed properly.</p>
<p><strong>And if you don’t meet your goal?</strong></p>
<p>Well, let's hope that doesn't happen. If we don't make it, the money will be used on the highest priority initiatives - editing, formatting, cover design and a website - in that order - as well as getting the book to you. I'll do everything in my power to make sure you get a professional product. That's priority one! </p>
<p><strong>What if you exceed your goal?</strong></p>
<p>From your fingertips to God's ears! The more money we raise, the more we can do! We'll do a book trailer, a series of fun promotional videos and illustrations to bring the book to life. I've prepared a fun package of bonus incentives that will enhance the Coulda, Woulda, Shoulda experience, including a retro (but oh, so grown up) cootie-catcher to give you insight into your love life, a specialty bookmark that has as many fingers as you do, a glossy story map to let you trace your steps along the way, and more!</p>
<p>And if things get <em>insane </em>up in here, <em>Coulda, Woulda, Shoulda</em> could become a full-colour, interactive <em>iBook</em>. It could be an app. It could be a <em>full-fledged video game</em>!</p>

</h2></div>","The Deal
 
Coming of Mage started as an idea for an entry in a short story contest.  Quickly it outgrew the 'short story' realm and grew into a novella, which, in turn, was picked up by some very wise folks over at North Star Press.  Doubling in size (and richness), Mage has become a full-blown novel.  My full-blown novel.  And, if you've ever spent more than a 3 minutes talking to me, you probably know how bad I've wanted this.  This is a dream 29 years in the making.
 
*Read a great interview about it here.
 
The Catch
 
As part of the ""book buy"" portion of my contract, I'm required to purchase so many copies of my own novel out of my own pocket.  The amount I purchase allows the publisher to gauge how serious I am about getting my novel out there.
 
I agreed to buy 100 copies. Pretty serious, right?
 
Even at a fair rate, this purchase is more than I have under my mattress. As many of you know, when not writing, I moonlight as a server at a restaurant attached to a ski resort. And unfortunately this “book buy” comes smack dab in the middle of the off-season.
 
Yeah. Ouch.
 
The Fix
 
I've finished the novel. Mage is happening as we speak. Funding for all the early morning coffee, late night energy drinks, laptops, pens, pencils, sweat, and tears that goes into the writing process is not what I'm asking for.  Don't worry.
 
But I do need a little help from my friends.
 
A hundred copies sold in stores would fetch $1300. That's what I'm asking for here. Good ol' market value. That'll cover my dues with North Star Press, transport and shipping, and put a dent in some of the press stuff I have planned: book signings, readings, tours, etc.

And do some research for the sequel at the same time! Hint hint!)
 
The Payoff
Specifics aside, this is a good deal for you too. A lot of you have been asking When can I get a copy? Can I pre-order one? Can I get a signed copy?
Is it on Goodreads?

<h3>My Name Is Lucian And It Has Been Three Years Since My Last Book</h3>
<p>With your generosity and tireless enthusiasm, I was able to produce my illustrated edition of the <i>Ars Goetia</i> back in 2014, and by the grace of the gods I was able to publish my (200% gayer by net weight) <i>Salome</i> in 2015.  This left me creatively reeling, cut adrift from my own, uncensored impulses, and I took 2016 to recalibrate. </p>
<p>By 2017, having permitted myself to luxuriate in illustrative magic, I had gone very wild indeed. I rejoiced in my newfound mental freedom, and spent the entire year working my claws to nubs to finally enact a piece of original work I have spent my entire life dreaming about: an exposition of the world inside my spirit, and the people that live there.</p>
<p><strong>That brings me to this: <i>An Ode To Divine &amp; Dirt</i>, an original grimoire, lovingly illustrated by me as a result of years of spiritual exploration and gnosis.</strong>  With 106 full colour illustrations of a veritable cavalcade of divine spirits and monstrous beings, <i>An Ode</i> reflects the inside of my heart without censorship.  I will introduce you to this world through its inhabitants, and the deities they worship.  My portraiture is uncompromising, and showcases people of a wide range appearances.  I cannot be bothered with the cis- and heteronormative portrayals of deities, and neither should you.  Let us explore other ways of illustrating the divine, and celebrating the monstrous.</p>
<p>I did not compromise on my artistic work in this book, and I did not want to quickly pay out for a run of paperbacks and then regret not seeing my work fully-fashioned as I imagined it, <strong>so that is why I need your help: to print (at first) 50 copies of <i>An Ode to Divine &amp; Dirt</i> in glorious luxury hardback.</strong></p>

</div><div>
<h3>Making Gorgeous Books Is Expensive</h3>
<p>I cannot produce this book without your help.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>A run of 50 hardback books will set me back a princely £1,352, and you can pre-order your copy RIGHT here. </strong> The specifications I have for the books are: white library cloth binding, gold foiling on the cover, antique gold headbands and gorgeous heavyweight natural uncoated recycled paper, so that the printed ink ""sinks"" into the page.  They will all be turned out by my favourite independent printer in the UK with whom I have worked numerous times before and so can vouch for their craftsmanship and the quality of their work.</li>
<li>I know not everyone can afford to splurge on a gorgeous book.  <strong>As such, I am also funding a run of 50 paperbacks, also pre-orderable through this campaign.</strong>  Also beautifully designed and printed in the UK, the paperbacks will feature a velvety matte cover, custom cover inners and that same sexy uncoated off-white recycled paper.  <strong>These will cost me a much more digestable £517</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is what you can order through this tasty crowdfunder:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Firstly, you can literally pre-order your very own copy of An Ode to Divine and Dirt right here, right now,</strong> and get it before anyone else, shipped directly into your eager hands by a little man in a car (the postal service).  <strong>All books ordered through this campaign will come furnished with a limited bookplate, available only to funders of the campaign</strong>, and of course, signed and scribbled in by my very own paws.  What more could you want?</li>
<li>
<strong>Handmade A4 prints</strong> on the tastiest paper I could source of never-before-seen uncut illustrations as they were when I drew them, before eventually being edited into book-ready form.  There is a choice of four!  Four!  Wow.  That's one for every mouth you'll ever grow in your life.</li>
<li>
<strong>Stickers!</strong>  You like the cover glyph, huh?  Do you wish one side of it was gummier than the other, yeah?  You want to put one gummy side onto a surface and/or thing and for it to stay there?  Well, you can have that dream realised with full adhesive function, ready to adorn your laptop or phone or face or dog. (NOTE: sticker not suitable for animal adhesion)</li>
<li>
<strong>Oh you wanted some enamel pins?</strong>  We've got enamel pins! The first illustrative enamel pin I have <i>ever</i> made, and you get to order them first.  The cover glyph features, colours inverted, in Goth Standard black and silver hard enamel.  I wouldn't produce anything I personally wouldn't wear, and I'm a <i>big </i>fan of enamel pins.  These are sweet as and I can't wait to get my hands on them!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>So, I want to raise £2200 in the first instance to cover the perks, the fees and, of course, fund the books properly. </strong> This is basically a riskless funder -<strong> the book is already completed</strong> (hell, I've even <strong>already registered the ISBN</strong> pending publication on the 1st of October) and even the enamel pins are already ordered!  <strong>Any surplus funds go directly into making yet more books.</strong>  The better funded this project gets, the more people get to own a copy of a unique piece of magic, and the longer I live.  It's a win-win.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535036874/qllsloie6v5sstljohkv.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>""But Lucian, I Don't Understand Magic Or Art And Don't Get Why I Should Care""</h3>
<p>You should care because art makes us who we are.  I'm not going to tell you that <i>my</i> work is going to make a sizeable social difference, teach you how to be a better person, or even pretend it will be very popular.  I merrily punch windows into weird places, filled with monsters, danger and nightmarish things, and I wouldn't for a moment pretend that I have Cool Mass-Market Appeal.  I'm weird, and so is this.  You knew that.  But what I <i>can</i> guarantee is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Good luck finding an illustrated grimoire like this one.</strong>  Is anyone else bored of physical disability, transness, and body modification being shorthand for ""monstrosity""?  Yeah, me too.  In my work, variant bodies live peacefully alongside the <i>actually</i> non-human and actually monstrous, because they're <i>normal</i>.  My people and their appearances are real.  They get to enjoy their own sensuality and beauty, unfetishised and as decorated as the gods. <strong> I wanted to create a magical art book that people like me, an extensively modified, scarred and unusually-gendered trans person, could enjoy <i>without</i> feeling alienated.  </strong>And I have.</li>
<li>I have created two gorgeous art books before this, and I see <i>An Ode</i> as being a continuation of my (bafflingly popular) 2016 magical landscape and psychogeography project <i>Where Am I, If Not Here?</i>  This is part of the Lucian Canon, sure, but <strong>I see it as my personal graduation into a space where I can share purely original content with you.  </strong>This crowd funder will have repercussions next year, for example.  This does not stop here.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535037207/l2w60yrvenx1ldpiqubk.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Every Day, I Take Out My Own Brain And Beat It With A Tube</h3>
<p>I have worked my fingers to the bone to create this book.  It is significantly larger than the Ars Goetia, and Salome, as well as not having the luxury of following pre-existing guides of a source text.  I have overcome all the risks already.  But for the sake of transparency, here's what could go wrong:</p>
<ul>
<li>The enamel pins explode in transit and we never get them.</li>
<li>My six backup locations all simultaneously melt and I lose my work (this includes the whole of Microsoft OneDrive)</li>
<li>I have no plan for overcoming these theoretical obstacles<i> because they're absurd.</i>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If we don't complete the £2200 funding, then I can put in a bit from my accounts that I've earned from doing cons twice a year, every year, since 2011, but basically it means fewer books.  <strong>This is happening. </strong> But it's mostly happening because of your generosity and belief in my work.<strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535037160/xnw2aja06wqouockwm4c.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3>""O Lucian I Have No Money And Must Scream""</h3>
<p>As long as you're screaming on the internet to tell people who <i>do</i> have money to come and help out, then I'm cool with that.</p>
<ul><li>
<strong>Indiegogo has share tools! </strong> Why not use those to share this campaign with your richer mates?  I believe in you!  You can do it!</li></ul>

This is what you can order through this tasty crowdfunder:


Firstly, you can literally pre-order your very own copy of An Ode to Divine and Dirt right here, right now, and get it before anyone else, shipped directly into your eager hands by a little man in a car (the postal service).  All books ordered through this campaign will come furnished with a limited bookplate, available only to funders of the campaign, and of course, signed and scribbled in by my very own paws.  What more could you want?

Handmade A4 prints on the tastiest paper I could source of never-before-seen uncut illustrations as they were when I drew them, before eventually being edited into book-ready form.  There is a choice of four!  Four!  Wow.  That's one for every mouth you'll ever grow in your life.

Stickers!  You like the cover glyph, huh?  Do you wish one side of it was gummier than the other, yeah?  You want to put one gummy side onto a surface and/or thing and for it to stay there?  Well, you can have that dream realised with full adhesive function, ready to adorn your laptop or phone or face or dog. (NOTE: sticker not suitable for animal adhesion)

Oh you wanted some enamel pins?  We've got enamel pins! The first illustrative enamel pin I have ever made, and you get to order them first.  The cover glyph features, colours inverted, in Goth Standard black and silver hard enamel.  I wouldn't produce anything I personally wouldn't wear, and I'm a big fan of enamel pins.  These are sweet as and I can't wait to get my hands on them!

So, I want to raise £2200 in the first instance to cover the perks, the fees and, of course, fund the books properly.  This is basically a riskless funder - the book is already completed (hell, I've even already registered the ISBN pending publication on the 1st of October) and even the enamel pins are already ordered!  Any surplus funds go directly into making yet more books.  The better funded this project gets, the more people get to own a copy of a unique piece of magic, and the longer I live.  It's a win-win.


""But Lucian, I Don't Understand Magic Or Art And Don't Get Why I Should Care""
You should care because art makes us who we are.  I'm not going to tell you that my work is going to make a sizeable social difference, teach you how to be a better person, or even pretend it will be very popular.  I merrily punch windows into weird places, filled with monsters, danger and nightmarish things, and I wouldn't for a moment pretend that I have Cool Mass-Market Appeal.  I'm weird, and so is this.  You knew that.  But what I can guarantee is this:


Good luck finding an illustrated grimoire like this one.  Is anyone else bored of physical disability, transness, and body modification being shorthand for ""monstrosity""?  Yeah, me too.  In my work, variant bodies live peacefully alongside the actually non-human and actually monstrous, because they're normal.  My people and their appearances are real.  They get to enjoy their own sensuality and beauty, unfetishised and as decorated as the gods.  I wanted to create a magical art book that people like me, an extensively modified, scarred and unusually-gendered trans person, could enjoy without feeling alienated.  And I have.
I have created two gorgeous art books before this, and I see An Ode as being a continuation of my (bafflingly popular) 2016 magical landscape and psychogeography project Where Am I, If Not Here?  This is part of the Lucian Canon, sure, but I see it as my personal graduation into a space where I can share purely original content with you.  This crowd funder will have repercussions next year, for example.  This does not stop here.



Every Day, I Take Out My Own Brain And Beat It With A Tube
I have worked my fingers to the bone to create this book.  It is significantly larger than the Ars Goetia, and Salome, as well as not having the luxury of following pre-existing guides of a source text.  I have overcome all the risks already.  But for the sake of transparency, here's what could go wrong:

The enamel pins explode in transit and we never get them.
My six backup locations all simultaneously melt and I lose my work (this includes the whole of Microsoft OneDrive)
I have no plan for overcoming these theoretical obstacles because they're absurd.


If we don't complete the £2200 funding, then I can put in a bit from my accounts that I've earned from doing cons twice a year, every year, since 2011, but basically it means fewer books.  This is happening.  But it's mostly happening because of your generosity and belief in my work.

""O Lucian I Have No Money And Must Scream""
As long as you're screaming on the internet to tell people who do have money to come and help out, then I'm cool with that.

Indiegogo has share tools!  Why not use those to share this campaign with your richer mates?  I believe in you!  You can do it!
I love you.  I want you to have this.  Let's get some.",5.0,0,"5 Campaigns

<h3>Saving the Guinea Hogs: The Recovery of an American Homestead Breed</h3>
<p>I am a former elementary teacher and former sustainable farmer with a passion for education, lifelong learning, and heritage breed animals. This is my fourth Indiegogo campaign focused on awareness and preservation of heritage breeds.</p>
<p>I discovered the Guinea Hog breed in 2013 and was immediately fascinated. There was so much unknown about the breed. I am curious with a strong desire to learn, so I decided to write the first book about Guinea Hogs.</p>
<p>Six years later I have completed the manuscript for my e-book. It will be released in mid-March. However, I need to hire talent to design the print books' interior and to produce a professional index. I will have both softcover and hardcover print editions. Adding a professional index and layout require additional expense. I would rather not incur additional credit card debt for this phase of my project. However, you can help by pre-ordering books during this fundraiser. <i>Saving the Guinea Hogs </i>will be a game-changer for breeders of the hogs.

<h3>The idea was simple.</h3>
<p>People were getting angrier and angrier at people going on spring break or flouting restrictions so I thought it would be funny to treat them like children and adopt the ""Stay The Fuck Home"" sentiment to illustrate a book I hoped I'd be able to turn into a viral video and a memento of this crazy thing we're all going through.</p>
<p>The exact same DAY I sent the files to the printer and paid for my first copies my brother sent me Samuel L Jackson's wonderful version. But you know what, I'd spent weeks making an actual, real book AND during the last few weeks I've been looking at how to help in my local community which has the oldest population in the country and is likely to be one of the hardest hit.  </p>
<p>One organisation really jumped out - the Ballina Meals on Wheels organization as by delivering food to elderly and otherwise at risk people they would be helping break the social chains that help the virus spread. When I talked to them they were already well ahead with planning on additional services such as more communication over the phone with this isolated group of people now they can't chat in person, grocery shopping, craft supplies and activities on top of higher safety measures so I knew straight away that some proceeds of the book should go to help them.</p>
<p>I've decided that after a one dollar admin fee per sale, all proceeds will go to them.</p>
<p>The idea that I might spread some humour at this time and help raise a bit of money for a local charity helped me focus and move forward through the uncertainty around us. So fuck it, we'll do it live!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The perks</h3>
<p>Well, are very simple. A digital eBook that will be available during the first week of the campaign and a print version that will be printed if the campaign reaches it's goal. If you purchase a print version you will get the digital version at no extra cost.</p>
<p>If the campaign doesn't reach it's goal to allow for printing then and physical book perks will be refunded but eBook perks will remain active.</p>
</div><div>
<p>I have the samples I am ready to click the Print button if the goals are met!</p>
<h3>Some uncertainties</h3>
</div><div>
<p>The biggest risk to this campaign is the ongoing COVID-19 situation. I have been speaking to the printer for the last week and they are confident it should take about 10-12 weeks to print and ship allowing for some delay time due to the virus. I will be using a fulfillment provider to ship the books once they're printed on the advice that even though the cost is greater it ensures a professional delivery service by a company with experience ensuring people get their orders.</p>
<p>So although there is some slack, in case things got worse it may add some time.</p>
<p>Another is the exchange rate. I can only run the campaign in Australian dollarydoos which have TANKED hard. I've worked out there is about a conservative $4 profit per physical book sold. It's possible the AUD could fall further and leave no profit at all but it's already at historical lows and the Australian government is supporting the economy very well.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>So Please</h3>
<p>Even if you can't contribute to this campaign, please share it, or even better - share a video of you reading the book! Also.. If you know anyone in the public eye that might read it, ask them! Samuel L, I'm looking at you!</p>

</h3> <p>Hi, my name is Jamie Arpin-Ricci, an author, writer and inner city Mennonite pastor.  For the last 20 years I've served full-time in ministry with Youth With A Mission (YWAM) Canada.  While I have largely served in Winnipeg, my work has also taking me to places like Haiti, Venezuela, New Zealand and beyond.  In that time, I've had some space to practice my passion- writing- but not nearly enough.  I always knew I would need to take some time off to give it the attention it deserved (and for me, the break I needed).</p>
<p>Given the nature of our ministry, I was not surprised to discover, recently, that I have been suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).  While the initial trauma is likely witnessing a friend take his own life, it was triggered &amp; diagnosed recently with the sudden death of another friend in our community.  This underscores my need to take time away from the full spectrum of my roles- pastor of our church; co-director of our mission; and director of our housing initiative.  So the time is now!<br/></p>
<p>By preparing now we will be ready for the sabbatical to begin in June 2015, giving me time to ""get all my affairs in order"" and, hopefully, raise some funds to make it possible.  My plan is to take <i><b>from June 2015 to January 2016</b></i> to dedicate myself to my writing, with several book projects planned.  It will also be a time of much needed study, personal/professional development and hopefully some time to travel.  In fact, one of my stretch goals includes a pilgrimage I've always dreamed of doing. (More on that later!)<br/></p>
<p>This is where I need you.  For the past 20 years, I have relied on the support of donors to pay my salary, as well as most of my work expenses.  Given the hours my role(s) demand, that support has never come close to minimum wage.  However, we've never gone without and we've always had people like you standing shoulder to shoulder with us.  I believe that will continue here.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>In order to cover the extra costs that this writing sabbatical will incur, I want to raise a minimum of $9000, which is around $1000 per month.  This will cover the cost of research materials, writing space, basic travel and conferences/courses.  It will also make it possible for my wife to continue in her leadership role in our work while I step away to focus on writing.  Perhaps most important, however, is for some of those funds to go towards counseling and treatment for my PTSD.<br/></p>
<p>What about those perks?  Well, here they are:</p> <ul>
<li>A $10 investment will get a personal thank you online on my website &amp; social media accounts.</li>
<li>At $20, you get the online acknowledgment of the previous perk, plus a personal (and personalized) video thank you on my Youtube channel.</li>
<li>With a $50 investment, you will get all the above, plus an autographed copy of my book <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/dp/0830836357/ref=as_li_ss_til?tag=emergenvoyage-20&amp;camp=213381&amp;creative=390973&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=0830836357&amp;adid=0QRT3Y05G8B20VWTDWQ0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Cost of Community: Jesus, St. Francis &amp; Life in the Kingdom""</a>. (Shipping outside Canada &amp; US will have addition cost).</li>
<li>At $100 you get all of the above, plus an autographed copy of my forthcoming book with Paraclete Press, tentatively titled ""The Beauty of Vulnerability: Radical Obedience, Missional Living, and St. Patrick of Ireland"". (Shipping outside Canada &amp; US will have addition cost).</li>
<li>With a $500 investment, you get all previous perks, plus I will name you in the acknowledgments of any books published as a result of the sabbatical.<br/>
</li>
<li>At $1000 you get all previous perks, plus I'll do a Skype workshop with a group of your choice on any topic I've written about for a least an hour.  (Shipping outside Canada &amp; US will have addition cost).</li>
<li>For $10,000, you will get all the perks from $500, plus, we will fly you into Winnipeg for a Weekend with <a href=""www.littleflowers.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Little Flowers Community</a>.  Meet our people, learn about our ministry- room &amp; board in our community house. (North America Only)<br/>
</li>
<li>Why not dream big?  Should anyone be so generous as to give $25,000, they will get everything in the $500 perk, plus I will fly to your city for two days &amp; give a workshop to a group of your choice.<br/>
</li> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3></h3>
<p>By using the ""flexible funding"" option, even if I don't reach my goal, I will receive all pledges made by the end of the campaign regardless.  However, I have every confidence that we will reach and surpass these goals!<br/></p> <h3>The Impact<br/>
</h3>
<p>When I began this work 20 years ago, I did so knowing that I would have to put writing aside for a season.  After a decade, I was able to write more often, but even then only as a tertiary focus.  However, this campaign will allow me to maximize this rare and exciting opportunity and focus fully on the discipline for several months.</p>
<p>My last two books took many months to write, but when I look at how much time it actually took, counting only the time I spent on them, it was a surprisingly small amount.  In other words, given the time and means to focus, I know I can produce more in that 9 months than I've been able to in the last 10 years.  With your help.</p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>As a published author, I know what is involved in making the most of this opportunity.  The risks for supporting me in this are honestly quite low.  For me, the stakes are too high to not take advantage of this rare gift of time &amp; resources.</p>
<p>The biggest challenges, beyond raising the funds to make it possible, is doing this in such a way that makes the most of the time without leaving my community and my family in the lurch.  That is why I am taking nearly a year to plan and prepare alongside everyone involved.  In truth, the more funds I raise, the easier it will be for me to do this in ways that won't negatively impact others.  Both my community and my family believe I should do this, which is important to me.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>I know that not everyone has the means to support a campaign like this with money.  So here are other ways you can help:</p> <ul>
<li>Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about this campaign.</li> <li>If you have ""air miles"" you can donate or a connection with an airline, those are much needed.</li>
<li>Know of creative ways to make this campaign a success?  Advice &amp; input is very welcome.</li>
<li>If you are local to us, volunteer in our ministry to help fill in the gaps my travel might leave in the community.<br/>
</li>
<li>Pray for us!<br/>
</li> </ul>
</div> <p>With all that said, let's do this.  Thanks &amp; peace!<br/></p></div>","So what's this all about?

Given the nature of our ministry, I was not surprised to discover, recently, that I have been suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).  While the initial trauma is likely witnessing a friend take his own life, it was triggered & diagnosed recently with the sudden death of another friend in our community.  This underscores my need to take time away from the full spectrum of my roles- pastor of our church; co-director of our mission; and director of our housing initiative.  So the time is now!
By preparing now we will be ready for the sabbatical to begin in June 2015, giving me time to ""get all my affairs in order"" and, hopefully, raise some funds to make it possible.  My plan is to take from June 2015 to January 2016 to dedicate myself to my writing, with several book projects planned.  It will also be a time of much needed study, personal/professional development and hopefully some time to travel.  In fact, one of my stretch goals includes a pilgrimage I've always dreamed of doing. (More on that later!)
This is where I need you.  For the past 20 years, I have relied on the support of donors to pay my salary, as well as most of my work expenses.  Given the hours my role(s) demand, that support has never come close to minimum wage.  However, we've never gone without and we've always had people like you standing shoulder to shoulder with us.  I believe that will continue here.
  What I Need & What You Get In order to cover the extra costs that this writing sabbatical will incur, I want to raise a minimum of $9000, which is around $1000 per month.  This will cover the cost of research materials, writing space, basic travel and conferences/courses.  It will also make it possible for my wife to continue in her leadership role in our work while I step away to focus on writing.  Perhaps most important, however, is for some of those funds to go towards counseling and treatment for my PTSD.
What about those perks?  Well, here they are: 
A $10 investment will get a personal thank you online on my website & social media accounts.
At $20, you get the online acknowledgment of the previous perk, plus a personal (and personalized) video thank you on my Youtube channel.
With a $50 investment, you will get all the above, plus an autographed copy of my book ""The Cost of Community: Jesus, St. Francis & Life in the Kingdom"". (Shipping outside Canada & US will have addition cost).
At $100 you get all of the above, plus an autographed copy of my forthcoming book with Paraclete Press, tentatively titled ""The Beauty of Vulnerability: Radical Obedience, Missional Living, and St. Patrick of Ireland"". (Shipping outside Canada & US will have addition cost).
With a $500 investment, you get all previous perks, plus I will name you in the acknowledgments of any books published as a result of the sabbatical.

At $1000 you get all previous perks, plus I'll do a Skype workshop with a group of your choice on any topic I've written about for a least an hour.  (Shipping outside Canada & US will have addition cost).
For $10,000, you will get all the perks from $500, plus, we will fly you into Winnipeg for a Weekend with Little Flowers Community.  Meet our people, learn about our ministry- room & board in our community house. (North America Only)

Why not dream big?  Should anyone be so generous as to give $25,000, they will get everything in the $500 perk, plus I will fly to your city for two days & give a workshop to a group of your choice.
 
  
By using the ""flexible funding"" option, even if I don't reach my goal, I will receive all pledges made by the end of the campaign regardless.  However, I have every confidence that we will reach and surpass these goals! The Impact

When I began this work 20 years ago, I did so knowing that I would have to put writing aside for a season.  After a decade, I was able to write more often, but even then only as a tertiary focus.  However, this campaign will allow me to maximize this rare and exciting opportunity and focus fully on the discipline for several months.
My last two books took many months to write, but when I look at how much time it actually took, counting only the time I spent on them, it was a surprisingly small amount.  In other words, given the time and means to focus, I know I can produce more in that 9 months than I've been able to in the last 10 years.  With your help.

  Risks & Challenges As a published author, I know what is involved in making the most of this opportunity.  The risks for supporting me in this are honestly quite low.  For me, the stakes are too high to not take advantage of this rare gift of time & resources.
The biggest challenges, beyond raising the funds to make it possible, is doing this in such a way that makes the most of the time without leaving my community and my family in the lurch.  That is why I am taking nearly a year to plan and prepare alongside everyone involved.  In truth, the more funds I raise, the easier it will be for me to do this in ways that won't negatively impact others.  Both my community and my family believe I should do this, which is important to me.
  Other Ways You Can Help I know that not everyone has the means to support a campaign like this with money.  So here are other ways you can help: 
Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about this campaign. If you have ""air miles"" you can donate or a connection with an airline, those are much needed.
Know of creative ways to make this campaign a success?  Advice & input is very welcome.
If you are local to us, volunteer in our ministry to help fill in the gaps my travel might leave in the community.

Pray for us!
 
 With all that said, let's do this.  Thanks & peace!",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<h3>Brick Desperately Needs Some New Equipment</h3>
<p><em>Brick</em><span> features a great many of the world’s best-loved writers, and has readers in every corner of the planet. </span>Both up-to-date and deeply engaged with what has come before, the magazine prizes the personal voice and celebrates opinion, passion, revelation, and the occasional bad joke. Our goal is to participate, as a Canadian literary presence, in the widest and most galvanizing exploration of the arts possible.</p>
<p>But while our content is on the cutting edge, the equipment we work on struggles to keep up with the times. As you'll see from our picture, our publisher and managing editor currently works on an iMac G4—the model that was discontinued in 2004! Our office chairs are more than a little worse for wear, and our phone, well, we'll post a picture so you can see for yourself.</p>
<p>Here are some phrases you may hear as Nadia waits for a file to download onto her computer:</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">     ""It's fine, really. It teaches me to practice patience.""</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">     ""I'll just go water the plants...""</p>
<p><em>Brick</em>is truly a labour of love, and though there's a lot of labour, there's a lot of love. <span>You can find out more about the magazine and read a sampling of our excellent content </span><a href=""http://www.brickmag.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">on our website</a><span>. </span></p>
<p>Please help us move our office into the present.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our goal is to purchase an up-to-date iMac for the office. This will allow us to work more efficiently as we put together our beloved magazine. This will cost $1,300.00 after taxes. If we raise the full $1,500.00 dollars, we plan to replace the hilariously rickety chair our publisher and managing editor spends her days in and get a new phone. </p>
<p>We appreciate any and all contributions, and we will happily recognize all contributions of $10.00 or more with a special thank you in our upcoming issue, <em>Brick</em> 90. Those who give $25.00 will get a set of beautiful <em>Brick</em> postcards. For any contribution over $50.00, you can get your name on the <em>Brick</em> Wall, which appears at the end of every issue of <em>Brick, </em>and if you donate $75.00 or more, we'll give you a free two-year subscription to the magazine, too. For donations over $150.00, we'll throw in a signed copy of a book by one of our editors.</p>
<p>If we cannot meet our goal, the money we raise will go towards a refurbished computer (which will still, no doubt, be a vast improvement on the one we're currently using). We will continue to publish <em>Brick</em> as long as we possibly can, with whatever equipment we can get our hands on. Nonethless, your contribution will be an incredible help and transform the way we put the magazine together.</p>

</div></div>","The Story

 


My
Name is Robert Ryan, a writer who is locked in a ginger manâ€™s body. I seek your
creative input and funding to feed my imagination, and help me to write two
books this year. The first book, â€˜Commutinyâ€™, will be written with, and
about, my local town in Ireland. The second book, 'Online Commutiny' will be a
story written with you, the funders, joining in as writers and also becoming
characters, depending on how much, or little, you want to be involved. (see
perks on the right hand side) I hope that by offering you the chance to, not only, get your
thoughts and words into my book, but giving you the opportunity to have your
name in it, we can create something special together. 




How the process will work: 

The idea is to write the books in a similar way to Chain Novels, only with a modern day social media approach. However, it will be slightly different in that I will write the start and middle of
the books myself, and work with you to create the rest of the story. For
'Commutiny' I will be looking for the people in my community to take part and to provide me with a sentence, paragraph or page of writing for the book, which I
will prompt from them via email or social network. I will send the begining of the story and
enough of the previous page to each person to enable them to follow on from,
and subsequently, send their work back to me, in the time frame provided. The more obscure and interesting
the contribution, the better the result will be. I will then add it to, and
edit it into the story and bring it together as a book. It will work the same
for 'Online Commutiny' except that it will be you, the generous funders, who I will
be getting the material from. 


 

 What the books are about: 



'Commutiny': The citizens of a small town in the South of Ireland called Cobh
(pronounced Cove) feel so aggrieved with the situation in the country, and the
way it is being run, they decide as a community, that they want to be
independent. As Cobh is only attached to the mainland by one bridge they take
it upon themselves to burn the bridge,
both literally and metaphorically to the fury of the government. Living free
was their dream but will it slowly turn into a nightmare??



'Online Commutiny': An ironic story about a
couple of friends who, with help from an online community, fight to take down social networks!! After a
drunken night out where they observed a complete lack of communication in the bar, as everyone was so engrossed in their phones, they make a video asking the
world to deactivate their social network profiles. As they believed the video
was just a rant that would go un-noticed, they soon forget that they posted it
online. That was, until a small group of followers steadily grew into a
community and back the two in their campaign. Together, they
start thinking that maybe they can, at least for a short time, change the world
back to the way it was. Back to a time when their â€˜friendsâ€™ were real, and if
those â€˜friendsâ€™ wrote on your wall, then they would be called vandals, not
friends.
The Impact


I
want this campaign to encourage people to chase their imagination and prove
that no matter how daft or big your dreams, if you believe in yourself and are
lucky enough to get the kicks in the right direction from people who believe in
you, you can achieve anything. Whether that dream is writing a book, taking on
your country as a little town or going against the world as a little group,
just go for it.



What We Need & What You Get
The money I need will all go towards advertising and publishing these two books. If I do not reach my goal in this campaign I will continue fundraising in other ways until I hit my target. I hope that with the unique perks I am offering we will get to where we want to be and next year, we will all be happy. Just imagine telling a new friend that you wrote a page in the new book by Robert Ryan. They dont believe you? Go to your bookshelf and show them! Go to the website and proudly point out your name as a contributor...Take that, new friend, where is your page, huh????

<p><strong>The Project </strong></p>
<p>Raised and educated in the heart of the Bible-belt, I didn’t look at certain groups of people as valid or respectable. Liberals, Jews, Muslims, Atheists, I was taught to convert them all. But there was one people group I looked down upon more than any other. For me the LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) community represented the worst of what sin had to offer, and I treated it and them with extreme prejudice. I was a bully, a bigot, and a modern-day Pharisee.</p>
<p>After an acquaintance came out of the closet, and was kicked out of her home and cut off from her family, something unexpected happened. For the first time in my spiritual life I began to question why I believed what I did about homosexuality. Were the warnings we always got about gays and lesbians based off of theological fact, or conservative, social stereotyping? And the voice inside of me judging my poor friend for coming out, was that “the Spirit” inside of me, or something else entirely?</p>
<p>I had to find out for myself.</p>
<p>I had to learn empathy because sympathy simply wouldn’t be enough to challenge my years of programming.</p>
<p>I needed to see how the label of gay would change how I was viewed by everyone around me, and if people would treat me like a second-class citizen for no other reason than that they believed I was gay.</p>
<p>And I needed to feel the isolation and repression of the closet… as much as I would be able.</p>
<p>In January 2009 I entered the closet a straight man and came out to my friends and family as a gay. I lived with the label for an entire year. After my life as I knew it had quickly unraveled into nothing, I began building a new one. I became a barista at a gay café. I played in a LGBT softball league. I protested in New York City with a group of gay activists that I had encountered years before while I studied Liberty University. And I even participated in a marriage equality event with the son on Jim and Tammy Faye, Jay Bakker. For a year I immersed myself, completely and utterly, in the small gay scene of Nashville, Tennessee, and experienced firsthand the agony of being isolated, repressed, and alone.</p>
<p>My book is the result of that year and it tells the story of the men and women that challenged, and ultimately changed my life’s path. It is a book about faith, and a book about doubt. But mostly it is a book about people, and how the men and women I’d always been taught to shun ended up saving my life.</p>
<p><strong>Why an Indiegogo campaign?</strong></p>
<p>The book releases in October 11<sup>th</sup> of this year, but before it does a lot of groundwork must be laid for it to have a real chance of making it in the tough, mainstream market. This work requires a quality PR firm to help get the word out. In addition, the final edits on the book must also be done by a quality editor. These two things are more than I am able to afford in the timeframe I we are looking at. In order to get this book out, we must raise approximately <strong>$8,000</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>$5,500 to hire a publicist for six months</strong></li>
<li><strong>$1,500 to the editor for the final draft revisions</strong></li>
<li><strong>$1,000 for travel expenses to Washington D.C. to meet with the Publicist</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>*What happens if we raise money over and above the goal? All funds raised above the $8,000 will go towards additional PR services needed, and the equipment needed to develop talks and workshops for speaking engagements. This is the next step after hiring the publicist.</strong></p>
<p><strong>FAQ</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This is <strong>not</strong> a book about <em>being</em> gay. As a straight man I am fundamentally unqualified to write that book. Instead this book is about what I could experience firsthand, and that is to feel for myself how the label of gay would affect both my external and internal life.</li>
<li>This book is <strong>not</strong> an exposé or a theological treatise. This book is the story about my personal experiences immersed in the gay scene of Nashville. And while I was befriended by a wide variety of individuals, I would never consider myself an expert in gay, bisexual, lesbian, or trans issues. The book is about my personal journey out of prejudice and the people who taught me along the way.</li>
<li>This book is not a Christian bashing or gay bashing book. While I am honest about the negative things I experienced during my year involving both, I learned that with any group of people there are positives and negatives.  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My Heart…</strong></p>
<p>My mission is to share the hearts and stories of others, so that people might begin to see and treat each other as human instead of by the labels of our religion, politics, or orientation.  I feel honored to have met the people I did during this experiment, and while my means were unorthodox to say the least, walking for a year in the shoes of a gay man, irrevocably changed my life. My intentions are not to tell you what to believe, but rather to show you what I believed, who I was, and to introduce you to a beautiful cast of characters that answered many of my questions without even knowing it. </p>
<p><strong>Will you help me? </strong></p>
<p>In a time where we are bombarded by stories of prejudice towards our fellow human, and when the American people are facing a national presidential election where equal rights will be playing a starring role, it is crucial that we re-examine our beliefs before casting our ballots. I believe this book will provide insight in a way that many others haven’t. It is a book of questions and experiences, and it is my prayer that you will walk with me through the story of my “<em>abominable” </em>year of living with the label of gay.  </p>

<p> </p>
<p>Hi, my name is Mike Harris, the grandson of William E. Thomas. I am in the middle of a project to publish and promote my grandfather's wonderful books. Having successfully published the first part of the trilogy, <em>Pegasus Falling</em>, I've now turned my attention to getting the second book published.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>#LetsgetGrampspublished!</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>“Brilliant is the only way to describe Pegasus Falling...A masterpiece of historical fiction.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>“A wonderful epic. This is an intriguing story, gripping from the first page to the last and full of sorrow, happiness, kindness and heartbreak.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>“I have been kept spellbound by this wonderful story.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>“I couldn't put it down and read it from start to finish in one day!”</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>On his retirement, William sat down to write a novel. The result was <em>The Cypress Branches</em>, an epic, beautifully written love story set against the backdrop of World War II and its aftermath.</p>
<p>It turned out he’d written an incredible piece of literary fiction. Ever since <em>Pegasus Falling</em>, the first part the <em>Cypress Branches</em> trilogy, was released last year, it has had praise heaped on it from readers and reviewers all over the globe.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/16639911@N07/8373936799/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Pegasus Falling cover - large by acuteAngle books, on Flickr""><img align=""right"" alt=""Pegasus Falling cover - large"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8354/8373936799_e8ddec7319_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p>
<p><em>Pegasus Falling</em> follows the story of Sammy Parker, a World War II paratrooper who, after attacking a German officer, finds himself incarcerated in a concentration camp.

<p> </p>
<h2>What we need and what it will mean...</h2>
<p>This is a series of books which was always meant to be published and read, but shortly after finishing them, William started to fall ill and was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease.</p>
<p>As the disease took hold it seemed that William's dream of seeing his work published was over. But I wasn't prepared to see the story end there.</p>
<p>Why? Because when I read <em>The Cypress Branches</em> I totally fell in love with it. And that is the case for a vast majority of other readers. It’s one of those books that when you read it, you want all your friends to read it as soon as possible so that you have someone else you can talk to about it. </p>
<p>I became determined that William should see his book in print and that it should have the chance to reach the audience it deserves. </p>
<p>After printing a limited run of hardbacks of the original manuscript in 2009, and fulfilling one dream by presenting a delighted William with a copy of his published book, I turned my attention to getting his work out to a wider audience. </p>
<p>William wrote <em>The</em> <em>Cypress Branches</em> in an episodic form, so I have been able to adapt the huge tome into a more manageable trilogy for release as a series of paperbacks. The first part - <em>Pegasus Falling - </em>was released in March last year. As well as <a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13606888-pegasus-falling?auto_login_attempted=true#other_reviews"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">universally excellent reviews</a>, it was also named as a Finalist in The Kindle Book Review’s <a href=""http://www.thekindlebookreview.net/2012-contest-winners/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Best Indie Books of 2012 contest</a>.</p>
<p>Part two - titled <em>It Never Was You</em> - has been edited and is almost ready to release. I can't wait to get copies into the hands of readers who will love it, but I need funds to make that happen. </p>
<p>And that’s where this campaign comes in. By raising funds early, I can give <em>It Never Was You</em> the launch it deserves. The £500 will finance an initial print run of the paperback. If we can raise even more, it will mean I can put together an effective marketing campaign and start work on the final instalment straight away.</p>
<p>This is a flexible funding campaign, so if I don’t reach the target amount, I’ll still invest what I have raised into the books. It will take much longer to complete the trilogy, though. That would be upsetting. Let's not think about it.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>The Perks...</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Get stuck in to the trilogy...</strong></h3>
<p>I’m determined that everyone who backs this campaign should get the chance to read at least one of the books in return, no matter what their budget...</p>
<p>If you haven’t yet read any of William’s books, just £3 (approx $5) will get you a digital copy of <em>Pegasus Falling</em> and £9 (approx $14) will get you the paperback sent directly from me to you. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Be one of the first to read <em>It Never Was You</em>...</strong></h3>
<p>If you’d like to be one of the first to read <em>It Never Was You</em>, you can be by choosing either the “digital saga continues” or “paperback saga continues” perk. These will be sent out to you the moment they’re off the press. I’m anticipating the ebook to be ready early-mid March and the paperback to be printed by mid-late March. They won’t be released to the shops until late April, so you should get your copy well in advance!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Get Personal...</strong></h3>
<p>For a £20 contribution, I’ll make it personal. Alas, William’s illness means he is unable to autograph his books, but I can offer you a personal, hand-written thank you note inside your book written by me, his grandson. It’s not the same, but it’s the next best thing...</p>
<p>If you’re as excited about the <em>Cypress Branches</em> trilogy as I am, then you’ll love the £75 perk. Not only will you be sent paperback copies of both <em>Pegasus Falling</em> and <em>It Never Was You</em> as soon as they’re available (with a personal thank you note in each one), you’ll also be named as a key sponsor on the acknowledgements page of <em>It Never Was You</em>. And you'll get the third book when it's released. </p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>

<p>Then you’ll want the <strong>The Cypress Branches Special Edition</strong>. For £100 contribution, not only will you receive everything in the £75 perk, but you’ll also get a copy of the beautiful special limited edition of the original hardback. Containing the manuscript as William wrote it (before I adapted it into a trilogy), only 108 copies were printed and it will never be printed in this form again. Each copy comes with its own certificate telling you which copy you have in the print run. Only family and close friends got copies and only a handful remain, so get in quick! </p>

Hi, my name is Mike Harris, the grandson of William E. Thomas. I am in the middle of a project to publish and promote my grandfather's wonderful books. Having successfully published the first part of the trilogy, Pegasus Falling, I've now turned my attention to getting the second book published.
 
#LetsgetGrampspublished!
 
“Brilliant is the only way to describe Pegasus Falling...A masterpiece of historical fiction.”
“A wonderful epic. This is an intriguing story, gripping from the first page to the last and full of sorrow, happiness, kindness and heartbreak.”
“I have been kept spellbound by this wonderful story.”
“I couldn't put it down and read it from start to finish in one day!”
 
On his retirement, William sat down to write a novel. The result was The Cypress Branches, an epic, beautifully written love story set against the backdrop of World War II and its aftermath.
It turned out he’d written an incredible piece of literary fiction. Ever since Pegasus Falling, the first part the Cypress Branches trilogy, was released last year, it has had praise heaped on it from readers and reviewers all over the globe.

Pegasus Falling follows the story of Sammy Parker, a World War II paratrooper who, after attacking a German officer, finds himself incarcerated in a concentration camp. There he discovers not only the horrors of the Nazi's final solution, but also Naomi, a woman who Sammy comes to depend on to survive. When the camp is liberated, the couple are separated and Sammy must battle to find out what happened to the woman he loves.

Part two of the trilogy, titled It Never Was You, is just about ready for release. Following the heartbreaking story of a middle class merchant seaman and his unexpected and rollercoaster relationship with a beautiful, exuberant waitress from the Liverpool docks, it continues the saga started in Pegasus Falling and packs a lot of emotion, drama and history into its pages.
Part love story, part social history, The Cypress Branches weaves together the stories of an incredible set of characters whose lives and loves are buffeted by the ever changing attitudes and culture of the twentieth century. They are ordinary people caught up in extraordinary times and it makes for exhilarating reading.

I'm Joe Plummer, I'm an author, and I write primarily about 
criminal influence within our banking and political system. A rough draft of my 
most recent book, Tragedy & Hope 
101, is now complete and 
available (for free) at TragedyAndHope.INFO. Now, it's just a matter of 
completing the final editing, getting the book into physical form, and then 
putting it into as many hands as possible.
I know that this is where I'm supposed to write some kind of ""pitch"" for the 
book, but this always makes me feel uncomfortable. Fortunately, G. Edward 
Griffin (author of the Creature from Jekyll Island) has written an introduction 
that will spare me the embarrassment. I've included his introduction below. 

Additionally, for those who don't have the time to read the rough draft, 
I’ve reposted part of a video that I recorded in 2012 at the beginning of the 
project. Hopefully this will clear up any questions about the book’s topic and convey the importance of spreading this information far and wide.

Last but not least, I want to sincerely thank each and every one of you who invests 
their time and money into learning about (and resisting) corporate and 
state-sponsored crime. If not for people like you, the world would be a very 
ugly place. (All money contributed to this campaign will be used to cover final editing, design, inventory and marketing costs.)  



Introductionby G. Edward Griffin
If you have 
ever watched an illusionist perform up-close magic, you know the power of 
misdirection and sleight-of-hand. Even in a room full of suspicious and 
attentive observers, the illusionist can fool them all. By exploiting known 
weaknesses in the human mind and employing his tools of the trade, he will 
deceive the crowd whether it wants to be deceived or not. 
Imagine 
what an equally talented “network” of political illusionists can accomplish. 
Performing before an audience of mostly trusting and casual observers, 
exploiting known weaknesses in the human mind, and employing their tools of the 
trade, they, too, will deceive the crowd whether it wants to be deceived or not.
Having 
spent nearly sixty years of my life researching and writing about the 
illusionists who control our world, I can say without reservation that you are 
about to learn some of their closest-held secrets. Joe has done an outstanding 
job of weeding through Carroll Quigley’s book,
Tragedy & Hope. He has captured the 
essence of what Quigley referred to as “the Network” and made this important 
information accessible to the average person who simply doesn’t have time to 
read a 1,300-page history book. Even for those who intend to read the entire 
volume, Joe has created an introduction and study guide that will serve the 
serious student well. 
Knowledge 
of who Carroll Quigley was and the deceptions that he revealed is essential for 
understanding the real world of today. His close relationship with the Network 
and his approval of its aims made it possible to provide an insider’s analysis 
of the minds and methods of the global elite. Without this knowledge, the 
actions of those who dominate the U.S. government and the Western world do not 
make sense. With it, everything falls into place. 
Be 
forewarned. The journey you are about to begin is not for the faint hearted. If 
you are comfortable with the illusions that currently pass for political 
reality, this book is not for you because, once you discover how the deceivers 
perform their magic, the comfort of ignorance is no longer possible. Once the 
bell is rung, it cannot be unrung.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><i>I Found Real Love</i> is a memoir by Leah Seelman. This book explores real examples of God's love that Leah has experienced throughout her life and the lives of people around her. <span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Each story connects the experience to a Scripture verse for the reader to look up and study. <i>I Found Real Love </i> challenges the reader to find God's love in everyday experiences and give Him glory for what He's done, what He continues to do, and what He will do.</span></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><i>I Found Real Love</i> is being published by JSA Publications, LLC which is a company designed to help authors self-publish their books. JSA does all the publishing work without taking royalties from the author. Unlike traditional publishing where the publisher pays for the production of the book and then takes royalties from the author, self-published books are funded by the author. This is where you come in. By ordering a copy of the book through this fundraiser, you're helping Leah pay for the printing of her book. The more funds raised, the more copies of the book can be printed and the quality of materials used in printing can be upgraded. Additionally, books ordered through this campaign will feature a poem written by Leah that will not be available in later printings. It's a win-win! Order your copy of <i>I Found Real Love</i> today or donate what you can to the general printing fund.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>It is Leah's hope and prayer that the reader of this book will discover real love as they move through the pages of these stories. The experience of writing and sharing this book will impact Leah too and will ultimately be one more story to add to her many wonderful life experiences.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are very limited risks with this campaign. At this point, the book is ready to be sent to the printer and will only take a few short days to process. Most of the challenges from this project came prior to this fundraiser. This is not only the first book that Leah has written, but it is also the first book that JSA Publications is publishing. Any problems that could arise, <i>while highly unlikely</i>, would come from an issue with the printing company such as printing on the wrong material or other such issues that sometimes, <i>but rarely</i>, happen with orders. In this case it would simply be a small delay in receiving the books while they are reprinted. There should not be any issue that arises that results in the book not getting printed, only delayed.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Maybe this book isn't for you or maybe you just can't afford a copy right now. There are other ways to support Leah. For instance, by sharing this campaign on social media, you can increase the amount of people who have access to it.

<p>This book shapes and forms the understanding of how faith and mental health cross paths, and it depicts this understanding through stories, songs, and more. I wrote it because I have personally dealt with generalized anxiety disorder, and my faith has played a huge role in this. I want to show people that they are never alone and that there is always help and an answer. My book will publish in February of 2020. </p>
<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<i>Every Rose Has Its Thorn- A Thorn in the Flesh</i> details my own personal stories about my battle with anxiety and how God has poured into my life to rescue me from myself. This book serves as a reminder that these battles and struggles are no match for our God, and He can rescue and bring us through anything we deal with. <br/><br/>My name is Sydney Radecki and I am the author of<i> Every Rose Has Its Thorn- A Thorn in the Flesh.</i> I wrote this book to end the stigma against mental health, and to show that you can be a Christian and suffer from mental disorders, while carrying your beliefs hand in hand. <br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how mental health and faith have a connection, but also that God is here with you and He can ultimately solve your problems. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for faith, healing, and mental health in you. And then, ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you fight through your hard times and trust that God is with you throughout all things. <br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover and find peace and know that you are not alone, and to discover the reality and truth of what suffering from a mental health disorder yet having a strong faith outlet truly looks like. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for being there for others, providing people with hope during their lowest times, and the excitement of serving as an inspiration for others to trust God to fight their battles. I hope that you will learn how having your identity set and found in Christ will enable you to know He can fight and win your battle. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you break your chains, find your peace, and to know that you are much more than your struggle. <br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about the connection between faith and mental health. <ul>
<li>You’ll hear my personal testimony about my personal faith journey and how I was saved. </li>
<li>You’ll hear tidbits and stories from many of my close friends who have shared about faith among many other things. </li>
<li>You’ll hear from real doctors and mental health counselors on strategies to take on your personal mental health struggles, while keeping a positive attitude. </li>
</ul>You will love this book if you are seeking to find truth to your struggle, and to find a way out of your present day situation. I also believe you will love this book if you are a mental health advocate and strong in your faith as well. <br/><i>Every Rose Has Its Thorn- A Thorn in the Flesh </i>is a non-fiction book that speaks to the advocates, Christians, and warriors who are looking at coping methods, comparisons, and stories for the first time. <h3> </h3>
<h3>The Book -Every Rose Has Its Thorn— A Thorn in the Flesh </h3>The book is written in five parts... <br/><br/>Part One contains the introduction + additional chapters. In this section readers will have the opportunity to learn more about my anxiety battle, and readers will begin to learn and see some insight about how God works in our lives even in the midst of these battles. <br/><br/>Part Two contains Chapters 14-19. In these chapters, readers will be immersed into the glory and goodness of God, and they will learn more about the Word of God, and how it is important to utilize this and look to God in the midst of our hardships. <br/><br/>Part Three contains Chapters 20-25. This part of the book contains detailed information on proven methods on how to cope with any mental health disorder. This section also provides lots of education in regards to mental health and the intersection of that and faith. <br/><br/>Part Four contains Chapters 26-31. These chapters depict and detail some of the various hardships we go through, but it also ties directly back into the hope that follows with it. This section is formatted so readers will learn that it is okay to not be okay, but it is also extremely important to look to the Lord during these moments. <br/><br/>Part 5 contains Chapters 32-37, and a closing letter. This final section aims to show readers my personal happy ending and resolution to my anxiety battle, by God’s grace. It also aims to show readers that they can get through anything they put their minds to, and that God will always see them through. <br/> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3>This book will be published with New Degree Press.

<p>Hello Fellow Pan Africans,</p>
<p>For those of you who have not received any mail piece from me before, let me introduce <a href=""http://www.weareallafricans.com/author.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Kwadwo Obeng"">myself</a>:</p>
<p>I am Kwadwo Obeng, the author of the book<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/dp/1935097318/ref=rdr_ext_tmb"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Tha book""> “WE Are All Africans – Exposing the Negative Influence of the Judeo-Christian-Islamic Religions on Africans”.</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>It is on weareallafricans.com, Amazon and Barnes and Nobles with excellent reviews. I am an activist promoting African renaissance and consciousness. My passion is the unity of the African families on the continent and the Diaspora, and, the integration of the 54 African colonies (countries) into one country with one Government for all Africa and the Countries of the Caribbean. My work involves establishing a new African Paradigm Shift by re-educating Africans on their real origin and history of Africa dating back to millions of years, appreciating our cultures, religions and traditions based on human values.</p>
<p>African people have been transformed into Europeans, Arabs and Jews by mis-education by Europeans, Arabs, and Jews using their powerful tools of their religions – Judaism, Christianity and Islam. We have been de-Africanized.</p>
<p>The book analyzes the teachings of these bogus religions that have been craftily packaged and promoted as ‘True’ religions for Africans. It debunks the Jewish and Arabic creation stories, Noah's global flood and so many others as myths that are no more valid than other creation stories told by other cultures, including African. It shows Jesus, Mohammed and Moses as not prophets of the world but political tyrants and violent terrorists who used their religions for control of the world including Africa. (Jesus’ own words reveal him as would-be terrorist too, if he ever returns). These men are not to be adored as prophets or saviors of African people. History and reality shows them as terrorists whose teachings have been responsible for the genocide of millions of African people during the past 2,000 years.</p>
<p><strong>Please </strong><strong>donate to the cause</strong></p>
<p>Using anthropology, paleontology, mitochondrial DNA, Y-Chromosomes, fossil record, and the history of our ancestors in the Nile Valley, it shows us that Africans are not and could not be the descendants of Adam who was created in Iraq (Mesopotamia) only 6,000 years ago according to biblical chronology.</p>
<p>Rather, African ancestors have been on the continent for millions of years as hominins/hominids, and as homo sapiens and homo sapien sapien (modern humans) during the past 200,000 years according to Dr. Spencer Wells. The bones of Dinkenesh (“Lucy”), a lady found in Ethiopia, have been dated by radiometric dating to 3.2 million years old.</p>
<h3>State of Pan Africa</h3>
<p>These religions have had tremendous influence on the world. For people of African descent, it has been disastrous – over 200 million either murdered or enslaved by Arabs, Jews, Americans, Europeans and Hindi Brahmins. Our lives have no value to them as evidenced by victims such as Emett Til, Trayvon Martin, Dr. King and so many others.</p>
<p>These people refuse to hear anything about <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">reparations </span>for harm caused African people.</p>
<p>African people have been coerced into accepting these religions as their culture and religions, and rejecting those of their ancestors. We have been branded as an inferior race only good to be slaves by these religions. This negative branding is still found in their so-called holy books – Torah, Talmud, Bible, Catechisms, Koran, Hadiths, and taught to their children, worst of all, our children.</p>
<p>We have been divided along lines of ‘race’ (near-white-skinned, light-skinned, in-between-skinned vs. black-skinned), religions of others, thus, creating terrible disunity among us. We have no respect or trust in each other.</p>
<p>Africans are killing each other in Nigeria, Somalia, Uganda, Tanzania, Ivory Coast over political ideologies, religion with European, Jewish and Arab involvement.</p>
<p>Our continent was partitioned and shared between European countries. Our quasi-governments backed by Americans and Europeans continue to operate within the boundaries of colonial territories since independence without any intentions of uniting us. These puppet politicians of these colonies pay lip-service of unity while promoting disunity with bogus organizations like Africa Union and Economic Communities.</p>
<p>We have developed strong nationalistic attachment to these colonial territories. So we are patriotic Ghanaians, Nigerians, South Africans, Ugandans, Kenyans…The divide and conquer has worked well for the Europeans and their supporters, including the newcomer, China, but against us. The truth is: we are not better off than we were 50 years ago.</p>
<p>Today, African people are at the bottom of society's social and economic ladder wherever we are. Our family is the most fragmented and disintegrated of all cultural groups due to the fact that we have rejected our African culture, traditions and religions that taught human values of familial love, unity, kindness, empathy, respect for life - human as well as animals, and, respect for elders, ancestors and authority. Present-day Africans are Africans only by skin color and place of birth. Sadly, the overwhelming majority thinks and aspires to be European, Jewish or Arabic.</p>
<p>We are a lost people who need to return to our roots – culture, religions, and learn our rich history. We are of Africa but Africa is not in us.</p>
<h3><strong>Loss of Natural Resources, Animals and Land</strong></h3>
<p>Our natural resources and ancestral farming lands are being depleted or sold to greedy corporations and investors in several African countries – Sierra Leone, Kenya, Ethiopia, Mozambique to name a few. Usually, indigenous Africans who have farmed the land, ancestral heritage, are forcibly moved to unsuitable land without compensation. The Afrikaans did that in South Africa; now misguided African politicians are implementing this wicked policy on Africans.</p>
<p>The industrialized world, including China, has a voracious appetite for Africa’s resources. We are obscenely exploited by outsiders, and our most corrupt politicians are collaborators in the exploitation for their self-enrichment. Africa’s animals are on the extinct list due to barbaric hunting and killing for sport or aphrodisiac purposes by Europeans, Arabs and Chinese.</p>
<h3>Soon there will be nothing left for Africans and the generations to come. Then what? Extermination!</h3>
<h3><strong>Time for a Revolutionary Change - Take Back Africa!</strong></h3>
<p>African people talk, moan and groan about our situation. We spend a lot of our time praying to Jesus or Allah to come and save us from the guns and swords, poisons in the hands of the people who brought us Jesus, Allah and Yahweh without taking action ourselves. We have become too passive, too afraid, always waiting for the 'white' man’s solution to problems they cause us. We rely on the UN, a white man’s organization for control of the world. They have used tactics such as assassination of our honest leaders – Lumumba, Khadafy, Sankara, and deposing of Pan African leaders like Osagyefo Kwame Nkrumah to stop unification and integration efforts.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Education as Key  </h3>
<p>We know everything about anybody except us. Now is the time to know who we really are and what we need to do about ourselves and for ourselves.</p>
<h3><strong>The impact of the book and what your contribution can accomplish</strong></h3>
<p>Two years ago we engaged in an educational program of a series of lectures based on the book. Unfortunately it was suspended. We would like to start again. The program covers the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>re-education of African people to un-learn what was taught to us and then learn the truths about ourselves</li>
<li>taking ownership of the continent from absolutely corrupt, power-hungry, murderous politicians who think they rule by divine power</li>
<li>undoing the mental harm done with these religions by eliminating Judaism, Christianity, Islam and Hinduism from Africa</li>
<li>integrating Africa back into one piece by erasing the colonial borders drawn around us by the Europeans at the Berlin conference</li>
<li>killing the African Union – a European organization to perpetuate disintegration, and setting up one continental government – Africa Republic – for all Africa and the Caribbean</li>
</ul><p>With unification and integration, we can solve the problems of the entire continent in an integrated fashion, rather than piecemeal, country by country (colony by colony). Integration will put Africa on a fast track, developing it into an economic, military and cultural superpower for the betterment of ALL African people regardless of their place of birth place of residence.</p>
<p>We can take control of our resources, unite all the family groups (tribes) to live side-by-side in peace as our ancestors did more than 200,000 years ago, and stand on our own feet without depending on the ‘international community’ of exploiters. No more war-lords creating mayhem on women and children on the continent. We can develop trans-continental infrastructure that can enable intra-continental and international trade and commerce with one economy. We can stop internecine wars, eliminate starvation and poverty. No African should go to bed on an empty stomach.</p>
<h3>Time to Dream Big!</h3>
<p>This may sound like a dream, but dreams acted upon by diligent people, become reality. With the aid of technology, this generation of Pan Africans can and <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">should</span> make this unified integration happen for the sake of our children and our ‘race’. Africa is broken; we are the only ones who can fix it.</p>

For those of you who have not received any mail piece from me before, let me introduce myself:

Each poem begins with a line from a published poem. </p><p>To date, over 130 of these exercises have been created by poets of all experiences and geographies – from state poet laureates to the casual journaler; from South Carolina to South Korea to South Africa. We've selected the best.</p><p>These poems reflect the way in which social media has transformed the ability of artists to engage with each other regardless of physical constraints or externally driven outcomes. </p><p>
</p><p>It’s a truly unique and layered book.  The anthology has two sections: collaborative poems and poems from the most frequent contributors.  The reason for publishing individual poems is our hope that by seeing the individual poem, the determined reader might excavate that poet's voice within the larger voice of the group. Almost like a soloist in a choral piece.  In addition, the e-book will have a clickable index of links to all the first lines so truly curious readers can compare and contrast.</p><p>
</p><p>The most  important part of this anthology is for archival reasons.  Unlike pre-digital artistic communities, there will be no cocktail napkins or scrawled notebook pages to reconstruct the ways in which artistic communities engage.  In regards to social media - entire conversations can be lost if one person deletes their account.  This book archives one digital salon over the period of a year.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3></h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/330398/files/20140126083322-svahalogo_small_final.png?1390754002"" src="""" style=""width: 110.02247191011236px; height: 72px;""/></p><p><span style=""font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 30px;"">Svaha Paradox Salon</span></p><p>The Svaha Paradox Salon, responds with agility to under-exposed artists whose voices are marginalized due to the way in which they are performed in the minds of the dominant culture. And together, we share the results with audiences. </p><p>Svaha Paradox Salon resumes where the Pittsburgh based organization Sun Crumbs left off in 2003.

Each poem begins with a line from a published poem. To date, over 130 of these exercises have been created by poets of all experiences and geographies – from state poet laureates to the casual journaler; from South Carolina to South Korea to South Africa. We've selected the best.These poems reflect the way in which social media has transformed the ability of artists to engage with each other regardless of physical constraints or externally driven outcomes. 
It’s a truly unique and layered book.  The anthology has two sections: collaborative poems and poems from the most frequent contributors.  The reason for publishing individual poems is our hope that by seeing the individual poem, the determined reader might excavate that poet's voice within the larger voice of the group. Almost like a soloist in a choral piece.  In addition, the e-book will have a clickable index of links to all the first lines so truly curious readers can compare and contrast.
The most  important part of this anthology is for archival reasons.  Unlike pre-digital artistic communities, there will be no cocktail napkins or scrawled notebook pages to reconstruct the ways in which artistic communities engage.  In regards to social media - entire conversations can be lost if one person deletes their account.  This book archives one digital salon over the period of a year.Svaha Paradox SalonThe Svaha Paradox Salon, responds with agility to under-exposed artists whose voices are marginalized due to the way in which they are performed in the minds of the dominant culture. And together, we share the results with audiences. Svaha Paradox Salon resumes where the Pittsburgh based organization Sun Crumbs left off in 2003. Through involvement In various art communities, Christina Springer seeks out artists whose exceptional work requires support from non-traditional sources. Svaha Paradox Salon provides the encouragement necessary to complete these projects. Making It HappenWe need your help to take the book out of the computer and into the real world.  M. Ayodele Heath has done a magnificent job running the salon, selecting, logging and editing the poems. The manuscript is in the hands of the excellent design team.  Krista Franklin has created a stunning cover.  We are going to print. We've raised the necessary funds to have this book in your hands by April 5th.    And we need your help to cross the finish line.  We know we have a great product. But, we need to communicate that to a wider audience.  That means throwing a fantastic launch party, taking the book to conferences, designing and implementing collaborative readings, promotions and advertising. Sample

The five cool stars above this town look down



The
five cool stars above this town look downfrom their hill.  They'd
rather sleep, they are lostknitted into our dark cloth of sky,
light bursting through at the seams.No one seems to recall when
they appeared, butnow they stay out of habit (or obligation) to
sailors and drunks.
Once
upon a time, they were a boy bandcaught between harmonics and
hormones,their future fueled by delicate chemistry,a powerful
mixture oftestosterone, adrenaline, ambition, and heartache
Spiraling
into control, like a galaxy—red dwarfs and supernovas, all the
same to this town—the five stars still seek the heart,
exploding liquid lava light through what is in the way.
In
their stuttering light, a long blue moansplinters into iridescent
shiversas a one-time fan tightens her shawl.  Turns the other
way.

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<i>The Death of Uncertainty</i><br/><br/><i>The Death of Uncertainty</i> is story of a world powered by a perfect AI algorithm that can accurately determine what the optimal decision is to any choice one may have — thus, in this world, no mistakes are made and everyone lives the optimal version of their respective lives. One day, a young man of this world stumbles upon suboptimality and adversity, which causes him to reflect on the system, helping him to explore the intersections of free will and uncertainty, adversity and fulfillment, and perfection and human nature...<br/><br/>My name is Michael Tan and I am the author of <i>The Death of Uncertainty</i>. I wrote this book because I hope to add value and insight to a pertinent development in our modern world, namely the rapid growth of Artificial Intelligence.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover both the myriad of ways in which AI can enhance human society and how it has the potential to degrade key parts of human nature. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for a vision of an AI future in you. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you think about both the physical and metaphysical implications of such a future.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about the inverse relationship between optimality and uncertainty and the relationship between free will and uncertainty.<p>The main character Viktor begins the story with a comfortable, optimal life where he is able to do everything perfectly and fulfill all his wants — his happiness is certain, guided by an AI that directs his every decision to optimality.</p>
<p>He then experiences real adversity for the first time and then overcomes it through his own free will without any technological aid, leading to a sense of internal fulfillment which causes him to reflect on his old life and wonder if there’s more to life than just maximizing happiness and pleasure.</p>
<p>Viktor confronts his old life after his new realizations and further explores the relationships between optimality, free will, and uncertainty.</p>
<p>You will love this book if you:</p>
<ul>
<li>are interested in the implications of AI</li>

</div></div>","The book is a philosophical inquiry into the themes of free will and the value of adversity through exploring a fictional, dystopic world where the optimal decision to every choice set can be ascertained through the use of AI. I wrote it because I wanted to explore philosophical and ethical questions that will be pertinent to our world in the near future and that stimulate my curiosity. My book will publish in February 2020.

<p>There may be a time when some people start to get a feeling that something is wrong. Many can look past that feeling or ignore it, but it can dig at you—and if you allow it to surface and consider that there is something to it, then your world can turn upside down. It will control the very essence of who you are and leave you feeling like an empty shell of who you once were.

<p>My memories are of what feels like a long time ago, or maybe it was yesterday… everything is running together in my memories. There was a discussion amongst a few of my friends about thinking you had done something before, that you had already lived the event and you knew what was going to happen.

<p>It was strange to start remembering things that were happening right now, pieces and remnants of something that had not even happened yet, but there it is, and it was happening again and again.

<h3>¿Qué?</h3>
<p><strong>El valle</strong> es una narración dura, cruda quizás, de ritmo ágil y alejada de los tópicos. Una trama de madurez, de redención quizá, con un poso de denuncia social latente e imposible de ignorar.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Estamos ante una historia pasional que más que zarandear golpea, que más que avisar actúa porque entiende de su necesidad e importancia. El Amor y la Revolución aparecen enredados como si fuesen una, quizás lo sean; nombrar el principio de uno o el final del otro resulta cuestionable. Por ambos mueres y por ambos vives, por ambos el hombre honrado y la mujer honrada llevan a cabo oscuros actos, tropieza u olvida su ética. Que la intensidad de la vida es distinta en la adolescencia, es algo que sabe todo aquel que haya cumplido los veintitantos, habiendo así pasado la brecha de tiempo más visceral. Imaginen el Amor y la Revolución estallando a esa edad tan molesta, enfocado principalmente en dos personajes que tratan de aprender sobre la marcha lo que nadie les ha enseñado. Enmarcado todo en las dimensiones de un pueblo pequeño, que actúa de olla a presión, acelerando hasta el vértigo lo que no necesita de vértigo para ser apasionante.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Arturo conoce el mismo día, a través de una de esas hermosas casualidades que trae la vida, a Manuela, y junto a ella, inseparables ambas, se encuentra con la Revolución. Ambos jóvenes, creyéndose ya adultos, se ven obligados a crecer, obligados a aprender a amar, y a ser revolucionarios. A mantenerse unidos sin olvidar la lucha. Se verán envueltos en batallas que no entienden, pero deben abordar, las batallas propias del día a día, y las batallas ajenas que traen la necesaria lucha por la justicia y la libertad. Además, el libro se estructura de un modo poco habitual, rompiendo la línea temporal clásica, creando un ente particular, parecido a un atractivo rompecabezas, que hará de su lectura una aventura mucho más embriagadora.   </p>
<h3>¿Quiénes?</h3>
<p><strong>Tandaia</strong> es una editorial con voluntad de cambio, de dar la alternativa a autores que no la encuentran en otro lugar, con nuevas y refrescantes ideas como es el emplear una campaña preventa para valorar la aceptación y viabilidad de cada título.</p>
<p>De este modo eres tú, ahora que te estás planteando cómo colaborar, el que decide si la obra que te presentamos verá la luz pasando a formar parte de nuestro catálogo... porque consideramos al lector parte fundamental del proceso.</p>
<p>Hoy te presentamos a <strong>Juan Mª Gallego Jara</strong>.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Nace y crece en Murcia bajo un ambiente siempre agradable y soleado. Creció enganchado a un balón de cuero, soñando quizás con llegar algún día a coronar el mundo, a través del esférico. Todo cambió el verano que había cumplido catorce años, llegó a sus manos, por medio de su madre, ávida lectora, un libro, al que en inicio no prestó demasiada atención. El libro era pequeño y fino, quizás por ello se decidió a leerlo, de haber sido más pesado, es probable, que hubiese continuado con su afán de patear el balón.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">El libro era <i>Cien años de soledad</i> de Gabriel García Márquez. Sin él pretenderlo, pronto comprobó, embriagado por las letras del artista colombiano, que se había visto infectado por una enfermedad benigna, agradable y hermosa, de la que ya no podría salir. De la mano de este y muchos otros libros aprendió que la vida no acababa en el patio donde siempre pasó sus tardes. Adquirió afinidad por descubrir luces y sombras de lugares que antes no conocía. Se entregó al camino, a pedalear de pueblo en pueblo por países desconocidos, de lenguajes distintos al suyo. Lugares que le promocionaban la emoción y la clarividencia para agarrar, siempre al vuelo, historias y personajes que ocuparían sus escritos.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Cabe decir que este libro, <i>El Valle</i>, fue escrito en su último viaje en bicicleta, a través de cuatro mil kilómetros, con la ayuda de un papel en blanco, y el valor necesario para rellenarlo con su tinta. Aún hay quien le pregunta «¿Por qué escritor?», y él responde contundente siempre con las mismas palabras: «He intentado ser muchas cosas, pero no logro imaginarme haciendo nada distinto a esto».</p>
<h3>¿Por qué?</h3>
<p>Y por aquí una muestra de lo que encontraréis en sus páginas:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">«Tu madre llegó a casa a eso del mediodía, yo llevaba horas amarrada al balcón con medio ojo puesto en ti que en silencio removías de un lado a otro los juguetes; taciturno y decaído, no eras más que un crío, pero ya sabías que algo no iba bien. Lo decían tus ojos que eran los que un niño jamás debiera poseer, ojos tristes sin futuro. Yo vi como tu Madre aparecía tras la esquina de la avenida, medio cuerpo suyo bañado del rojo sangre de su pecho izquierdo, desnuda caminaba erguida, con la frente alta, y la mirada precisa y profunda. Los balcones se llenaban de gente, también los portales y las terrazas de los bares, la mayoría guardaba un absoluto silencio, unos pocos lloraban, otros reían jocosos, e incluso algún hijo de puta se atrevió valiéndose de su cobardía y de la multitud que lo hacía invisible para llamarla puta, y ordenarle que se tapase.<br/>          Pero no, ella no se tapó.<br/>          Ella no se tapó porque no tenía pecado que ocultar, porque no había errado, porque ella solo luchó con honor y valor, con orgullo y nobleza. No se tapa, avanza erguida mientras con su mano izquierda arrastra el trapo con el que los militares la obsequiaron para cubrirse. No usará el trapo, jamás lo hará. Este trapo no es otro que la nueva bandera nacionalista, la que extendió su poder a fuerza de terror, la que mató a sus hermanos, la que mató al padre de sus hijos. María se desangraría, pero no taparía con esa bandera su herida, ni escondería su cuerpo que es libre, aunque haya sido mutilado»</p>
<h3>¿Cómo?</h3>
<p>Para arrancar el proyecto nos hemos fijado como objetivo 920€; esta es la cantidad que recaudaríamos si alrededor de cincuenta mecenas se hiciesen, cada cual, con un ejemplar de esta primera edición.</p>
<ul>
<li>Teniendo acceso a las galeradas de edición.</li>
<li>Recibiendo un ejemplar semanas antes de la salida al mercado de la obra.</li>
<li>Si bien, también podrías ver tu nombre en los agradecimientos aportando un poco más.</li>
</ul>
<p>Los fondos recaudados, se utilizarán como ayuda para sacar adelante esta primera edición de <i>El valle</i> que saldría después a la venta.</p>
<h3>Además...</h3>
<p>Sabemos que son tiempos difíciles, también nosotros los sufrimos, y es posible que no te encuentres en disposición de apoyarnos con tu mecenazgo en estos momentos... pero esperamos que si esto te ha llegado al alma, incluso si tal vez conoces en persona al autor, trates de difundir esta campaña (facebook, twitter, blogger, boca-oreja... ) para que alcancemos nuestra meta y <strong>Juan Mª Gallego Jara</strong> vea publicada su obra.</p>
<p>Gracias por vuestro tiempo.</p>

Ambos jóvenes, creyéndose ya adultos, se ven obligados a crecer, obligados a aprender a amar, y a ser revolucionarios. A mantenerse unidos sin olvidar la lucha. Se verán envueltos en batallas que no entienden, pero deben abordar, las batallas propias del día a día, y las batallas ajenas que traen la necesaria lucha por la justicia y la libertad. Además, el libro se estructura de un modo poco habitual, rompiendo la línea temporal clásica, creando un ente particular, parecido a un atractivo rompecabezas, que hará de su lectura una aventura mucho más embriagadora.   
¿Quiénes?
Tandaia es una editorial con voluntad de cambio, de dar la alternativa a autores que no la encuentran en otro lugar, con nuevas y refrescantes ideas como es el emplear una campaña preventa para valorar la aceptación y viabilidad de cada título.
De este modo eres tú, ahora que te estás planteando cómo colaborar, el que decide si la obra que te presentamos verá la luz pasando a formar parte de nuestro catálogo... porque consideramos al lector parte fundamental del proceso.
Hoy te presentamos a Juan Mª Gallego Jara.
Nace y crece en Murcia bajo un ambiente siempre agradable y soleado. Creció enganchado a un balón de cuero, soñando quizás con llegar algún día a coronar el mundo, a través del esférico. Todo cambió el verano que había cumplido catorce años, llegó a sus manos, por medio de su madre, ávida lectora, un libro, al que en inicio no prestó demasiada atención. El libro era pequeño y fino, quizás por ello se decidió a leerlo, de haber sido más pesado, es probable, que hubiese continuado con su afán de patear el balón.
El libro era Cien años de soledad de Gabriel García Márquez. Sin él pretenderlo, pronto comprobó, embriagado por las letras del artista colombiano, que se había visto infectado por una enfermedad benigna, agradable y hermosa, de la que ya no podría salir. De la mano de este y muchos otros libros aprendió que la vida no acababa en el patio donde siempre pasó sus tardes. Adquirió afinidad por descubrir luces y sombras de lugares que antes no conocía. Se entregó al camino, a pedalear de pueblo en pueblo por países desconocidos, de lenguajes distintos al suyo. Lugares que le promocionaban la emoción y la clarividencia para agarrar, siempre al vuelo, historias y personajes que ocuparían sus escritos.
Cabe decir que este libro, El Valle, fue escrito en su último viaje en bicicleta, a través de cuatro mil kilómetros, con la ayuda de un papel en blanco, y el valor necesario para rellenarlo con su tinta. Aún hay quien le pregunta «¿Por qué escritor?», y él responde contundente siempre con las mismas palabras: «He intentado ser muchas cosas, pero no logro imaginarme haciendo nada distinto a esto».
¿Por qué?
Y por aquí una muestra de lo que encontraréis en sus páginas:
«Tu madre llegó a casa a eso del mediodía, yo llevaba horas amarrada al balcón con medio ojo puesto en ti que en silencio removías de un lado a otro los juguetes; taciturno y decaído, no eras más que un crío, pero ya sabías que algo no iba bien. Lo decían tus ojos que eran los que un niño jamás debiera poseer, ojos tristes sin futuro. Yo vi como tu Madre aparecía tras la esquina de la avenida, medio cuerpo suyo bañado del rojo sangre de su pecho izquierdo, desnuda caminaba erguida, con la frente alta, y la mirada precisa y profunda. Los balcones se llenaban de gente, también los portales y las terrazas de los bares, la mayoría guardaba un absoluto silencio, unos pocos lloraban, otros reían jocosos, e incluso algún hijo de puta se atrevió valiéndose de su cobardía y de la multitud que lo hacía invisible para llamarla puta, y ordenarle que se tapase.          Pero no, ella no se tapó.          Ella no se tapó porque no tenía pecado que ocultar, porque no había errado, porque ella solo luchó con honor y valor, con orgullo y nobleza. No se tapa, avanza erguida mientras con su mano izquierda arrastra el trapo con el que los militares la obsequiaron para cubrirse. No usará el trapo, jamás lo hará. Este trapo no es otro que la nueva bandera nacionalista, la que extendió su poder a fuerza de terror, la que mató a sus hermanos, la que mató al padre de sus hijos. María se desangraría, pero no taparía con esa bandera su herida, ni escondería su cuerpo que es libre, aunque haya sido mutilado»
¿Cómo?
Para arrancar el proyecto nos hemos fijado como objetivo 920€; esta es la cantidad que recaudaríamos si alrededor de cincuenta mecenas se hiciesen, cada cual, con un ejemplar de esta primera edición.

Teniendo acceso a las galeradas de edición.
Recibiendo un ejemplar semanas antes de la salida al mercado de la obra.
Si bien, también podrías ver tu nombre en los agradecimientos aportando un poco más.

Los fondos recaudados, se utilizarán como ayuda para sacar adelante esta primera edición de El valle que saldría después a la venta.
Además...
Sabemos que son tiempos difíciles, también nosotros los sufrimos, y es posible que no te encuentres en disposición de apoyarnos con tu mecenazgo en estos momentos... pero esperamos que si esto te ha llegado al alma, incluso si tal vez conoces en persona al autor, trates de difundir esta campaña (facebook, twitter, blogger, boca-oreja... ) para que alcancemos nuestra meta y Juan Mª Gallego Jara vea publicada su obra.
Gracias por vuestro tiempo.",0.0,0,"228 Campaigns

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">A Poetry Book - Based On Your Suggestions On Instagram</span></h3>
<p>Hey, I'm Tom.</p>
<p>Over the last few weeks, I've been asking my friends on Instagram to suggest subjects for me to write poems about; and I've crammed more than 50 of my favourites into my first <i>ever </i>poetry book.</p>
<p>Even more importantly, I'm going to be <strong>donating 100% of the profits</strong> from the sale of the book to <strong>two very important charities</strong>: Beat Eating Disorders and The Trussell Trust, who help support a network of food banks across the UK.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1600585056/x2pmqt0l32i4sh479udx.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>To say thank you for your support, we've put together some great perks. For just £15 you can get your hands on an exclusive signed copy of the book, and all perks come with free shipping in the UK.</p>
<p>The book has had some great reviews so far, and it would really mean a lot if you could help me get this project off the ground, so we can raise some money for two very worthwhile causes.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/s/aGlnaGxpZ2h0OjE3ODgxMTA5ODM5NzQwOTE3?igshid=kec9hb2j57qu&amp;story_media_id=2381407885113912060_2064199075"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i><strong>You can read my first attempts at Instagram poetry here</strong></i></a></p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What's The Plan?</h3>
<p>I've written nearly 100 poems, and in the next couple of weeks we're going to pick our 50 favourites to go in the book. If you have any last-minute ideas for subjects, <a href=""https://instagram.com/tomandthat"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">feel free to suggest it on Instagram</a>!</p>
<p>Some very generous and talented artists have kindly provided accompanying illustrations, so in total, there will be well over 100 pages of artistic goodness to bring joy to your soul.</p>
<p>I'm now hoping to raise enough money to fund a limited print run of 200 copies of the book, to raise money for our chosen charities - that's where we need your help.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1600635439/mexauxy1zakoscyl0ouw.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>As a thank-you for your support, I'd like to include some spectacular rewards to supporters of our campaign; including, but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Signed copies of the book</li>
<li>Exclusive Jobs For Beluga Whales merch, including postcards and tea towels</li>
<li>Your own, unique, hand-written poem</li>
<li>The option of having your book blessed by a priest before shipping</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>What Are The Poems About?</h3>
<p>All of the poems in the book are based on subjects people have suggested to me on Instagram. I've been sent some very weird and wonderful topics to write about.</p>
<p>I won't list them all, because there are more than 50 in total, but some of my favourite poems include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Zoom Meetings</p></li>
<li><p>The Origin Of Eels</p></li>
<li><p>Staring At Goats</p></li>
<li><p>Low Calorie Hot Chocolate Sachets - 35p in Morrisons</p></li>
<li><p>Getting a static shock when you get up from an office chair and try to open a door</p></li>
<li><p>Showerhead Limescale</p></li>

<p> </p>
<h3>Where Will The Money Go?</h3>
<p>Once we've covered the costs of printing the book, and of course the rewards, all the money generated from the sale of Jobs For Beluga Whales will be donated to two very important charities:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Trussell Trust</strong></p>
<p><a href=""https://www.trusselltrust.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Trussell Trust</a> supports a nationwide network of food banks, providing emergency food and support to people living in poverty. Astonishingly, that’s more than 14 million people in the UK, including more than 4 million children. Perhaps more importantly, they also campaign to end the structural inequalities in our society which mean that food banks, sadly, are still a necessity in 2020.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Beat Eating Disorders</strong></p>
<p><a href=""https://www.beateatingdisorders.org.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Beat</a> is the UK’s eating disorder charity. They carry out invaluable work in helping people who are suffering, one way or another, as a result of often very serious conditions. Having witnessed first-hand the impact eating disorders can have, it means an enormous amount to me that we’re able to help Beat support others who are struggling.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I've got a fantastic team of people helping me put the book together, including editors, illustrators, photographers, and graphic designers; and nobody has asked for a single penny in exchange for their time and effort. As soon as we've paid the printing costs, <i>all</i> of the money will be going to Beat and The Trussell Trust.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Who On Earth Are You?</h3>
<p>My name is Tom (<a href=""https://instagram.com/tomandthat"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">@TomAndThat on Instagram</a>), and in my day job I work in the creative industries.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1600584773/c5cf5opo6o2xjoqpybsj.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I help to organise a music festival in Lincolnshire called <a href=""https://beyondthewoods.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Beyond The Woods</a>, and make social media content for Annie Mac's show on BBC Radio 1.</p>
<p>In my spare time I enjoy running, and making silly things for the internet. When Tony Blair was the prime minister, he sent me a congratulatory letter for watching all three Lord Of The Rings films back-to-back, without any toilet breaks.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Finances</h3>
<p>After a lot of shopping around for prices, to print 200 copies of the book will cost us £800 (including Indiegogo's Fees).</p>
<p>The remaining £200 will go towards funding the rewards for our amazing supporters. Costs include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Upgrading up to 20 books to hardback editions</p></li>
<li><p>Jobs For Beluga Whales postcards + tea towels</p></li>
<li><p>Certificates of blessing, and travel expenses for our chosen priest</p></li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1600637004/t45znhmpenuaokp2bxt6.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What If We Don't Raise £1,000?</strong></p>
<p>Of course the plan is to raise more than the £1,000 we need, but if we're not able to raise the full amount then we'll order as many books as we can for the amount of money raised. For example: If we get half the funds, we might only order half the books.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What If We Raise More Than £1,000?</strong></p>
<p>If we end up raising more than the £1,000 we need - which would be incredible - any excess profits will be donated to our charities. We won't order any more than 200 books.</p>
<p>If all of the perks were claimed by the end of our crowdfunding run, it would mean being able to donate almost £5,500 to our two charities!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Of course, I completely understand that money is pretty tight for a lot of people at the moment. If you can't support the project financially (or even if you can), I'd be hugely grateful for your help in spreading the word; and letting people know about the book, and the charities we're supporting.</p>
<p>Even something as simple as sharing the link to this page on your socials, and telling people a bit about what we're trying to achieve, would make a massive difference.</p>
<p>Thank you for your help!</p>

<h2>Sun Salutations to all!</h2>
<h2>Thank you for your attention. You will love this story, you are part of it !!</h2>
<p>My name is Flor Fernández. This campaign is launched to finance the publication, presentation and publicity of the novel ""Marina´s Journey"". It is of utmost importance for me. I am 45, and I had always known I had to publish since I was a child. It is also a way to show that when there is a crisis, there is always the possibility of listening to one´s heart to get out of it. Ater 13 years in Scotland, where I was teaching Spanish in several Univerisities and companies, I have been back in Spain for four years. I haven´t found a job in this time, and I have seen many people losing theirs.</p>
<p>The core point of the book is <strong>: ""The magic of pure hearts works"".</strong>When you know inside who you are, then you have to<strong> follow your inner compass</strong>.</p>
<p>This will be a successful project that <strong>will benefit many people</strong>.</p>
<p>""Marina´s Journey"" is an<strong> invitation to the reader</strong> to identify himself/herself with all characters, with the landscapes, the moods and the processes that fill the pages. It transmits a wellbeing sensation. In a certain way it is a kind of guided visualization that shows us parts of our collective consciousness, hence parts of ourselves. The reading will give you a holiday, where you can liberate from stress and tensions. You will fly with your imagination in territories that will <strong>fill you with brilliant sensations</strong>. It may surprise that Marina is a fairy. Nevertheless, it is not the intention of this book to be a fairytale story as such. Marina is a part of you. It is open to people of all ages. </p>
<p>There are some notes at the end of the book, where the deeper meaning of some of the metaphors is explained.</p>
<p><br/>It started as a dream of a summer night, from where the first 9 pages were written and it continued as a metaphore of the weakening in communication that arises out of antagonism and how it generates obstacles.</p>
<p>Marina is searching for what can she offer to her community to help them overcome the fact that they have split in two bands. It reflects what happens in society. It conveys the idea that the individual has a meaningful and unique way to offer his/her gifts in the co-creation of a fair society.</p>
<p>The division has ocurred over a disagreement regarding how to deliver Blue Berries to humanity . In the story the blue berries are a fruit, generously given by Nature to mankind. It is a metaphor that it is in our nature to find states of harmony and balance and transmit that to others. The tree of the biue berries is symbolic of the capacity of each person to ground the dreams of their souls, to nourish the seeds that are carrying inside since birth.</p>
<p>This book encourages deep listening, respect for all forms of life and the capacity to transcend by opening the imagination and the heart.</p>
<p>It will certainly benefit all those who take part and all those who read it. Everybody involved will feel part of a valuable, meaningful life experience that connects all of us through our hearts. On the other hand, relevant current issues that affect our communities are touched, such as the problems with food and obesity that have spread so fast in some countries. The solutions that appear will speak to the inner child, that will understand that there are always solutions to reach the inner balance.</p>
<p><br/>The money raised will go towards the payment of the revision, editing and printing of the first 1000 books, the launching and the publicity, as well as the supervision of its translation into English. During the presentations of the book I would like to sing the songs that came to me and appear in the book, as well as organise beautiful inspiring evenings, with meditations, music and question/answer time .</p>

Thank you for your attention. You will love this story, you are part of it !!
My name is Flor Fernández. This campaign is launched to finance the publication, presentation and publicity of the novel ""Marina´s Journey"". It is of utmost importance for me. I am 45, and I had always known I had to publish since I was a child. It is also a way to show that when there is a crisis, there is always the possibility of listening to one´s heart to get out of it. Ater 13 years in Scotland, where I was teaching Spanish in several Univerisities and companies, I have been back in Spain for four years. I haven´t found a job in this time, and I have seen many people losing theirs.
The core point of the book is : ""The magic of pure hearts works"".When you know inside who you are, then you have to follow your inner compass.
This will be a successful project that will benefit many people.
""Marina´s Journey"" is an invitation to the reader to identify himself/herself with all characters, with the landscapes, the moods and the processes that fill the pages. It transmits a wellbeing sensation. In a certain way it is a kind of guided visualization that shows us parts of our collective consciousness, hence parts of ourselves. The reading will give you a holiday, where you can liberate from stress and tensions. You will fly with your imagination in territories that will fill you with brilliant sensations. It may surprise that Marina is a fairy. Nevertheless, it is not the intention of this book to be a fairytale story as such. Marina is a part of you. It is open to people of all ages. 
There are some notes at the end of the book, where the deeper meaning of some of the metaphors is explained.
It started as a dream of a summer night, from where the first 9 pages were written and it continued as a metaphore of the weakening in communication that arises out of antagonism and how it generates obstacles.
Marina is searching for what can she offer to her community to help them overcome the fact that they have split in two bands. It reflects what happens in society. It conveys the idea that the individual has a meaningful and unique way to offer his/her gifts in the co-creation of a fair society.
The division has ocurred over a disagreement regarding how to deliver Blue Berries to humanity . In the story the blue berries are a fruit, generously given by Nature to mankind. It is a metaphor that it is in our nature to find states of harmony and balance and transmit that to others. The tree of the biue berries is symbolic of the capacity of each person to ground the dreams of their souls, to nourish the seeds that are carrying inside since birth.
This book encourages deep listening, respect for all forms of life and the capacity to transcend by opening the imagination and the heart.
It will certainly benefit all those who take part and all those who read it. Everybody involved will feel part of a valuable, meaningful life experience that connects all of us through our hearts. On the other hand, relevant current issues that affect our communities are touched, such as the problems with food and obesity that have spread so fast in some countries. The solutions that appear will speak to the inner child, that will understand that there are always solutions to reach the inner balance.
The money raised will go towards the payment of the revision, editing and printing of the first 1000 books, the launching and the publicity, as well as the supervision of its translation into English. During the presentations of the book I would like to sing the songs that came to me and appear in the book, as well as organise beautiful inspiring evenings, with meditations, music and question/answer time .
This is a book to spread happiness, healing and union. It stimulates creativity, reading between lines and the trust in oneself and the community.
Oceans of gratitude for your attention, for reading me, for your support and for seeing with as much clarity as me that this project deserves to reach the public as soon as possible.
 If the financial goal were not to be reached, then I would reduce the number of copies published to 500, all depending on budget, as well as cutting expenses from the organasation of the presentation, publicity etc.
My most sincere thanks to all of you and to all those who pass the word around to their family and friends. Together it will happen: I am sure. Thank you!!
Dedicated to all the children in the Earth, and to the inner child of all the adults. Dedicated as well to my parents and to all parents.

</p><p>What to say,<i> what to say</i>...
Well, honestly, I am wholly new at this. I can’t make any claims that I know
entirely what I am doing. But even though I am a novice in this industry,
I am fervently committed. I live, breathe and lose sleep over
this project, because I have this saga I am compelled to share.</p>
<p>Somewhere deep within, a creativity I
didn’t think I harbored, awoke from sharing my grandparents history to a
particular friend. Over the years, every person I ever told my family's story
to, I’ve been rewarded with his or her genuine intrigue and downright shock;
while morbidly, I’ve relished each and every one of their reactions to it!</p>
<p>Now see, this friend, while consumed
with my tale, offhandedly said “you’ve got to be kidding…this sounds like a
book I haven’t read yet.”  </p>
<p align=""center""><b>And that statement was the catalytic
point that steered me towards my new endeavor.</b></p>
<p>So here I am now, composing this book
in a way that allows my imagination to run wild with creativity, whilst
allowing the essence of their story to be shared at the same time. </p>
<p>With <b>Farewell, my Loves</b>, I’ll
give you the romance novel that emerged from my late mother's accounts of her
parents’ true story.</p>
<p align=""center""><b>But with passion, comes struggle...</b></p>
<p>I’m not afraid of the work this project
entails. Actually, as mentioned before, I am consumed. I have been working on
this non-stop. Whether it is researching deeper into my family history from
those left to tell it, how I will go about publishing once I’ve finished
compiling the story, or the late nights getting in a scene that <i>just has to
be written;</i> nevertheless, it all requires time, capital and dedication to
complete it.</p>
<p>At the moment, my novel is a work in
progress. <i>The story is already there</i>. The drafts are being written. The
process has fully commenced; however I am not too proud to admit that I need
help.</p>
<p align=""center""><b>This is where all you generous
contributors come in</b>.</p>
<p>Sincerely, this form of a “book
advance” will help. Freelance work isn’t free after all!</p>
<p>But most importantly, after completing
the manuscript I need it to be copy edited. Checked for grammatical corrections
after my eyes have twisted to the point I can’t find the errors myself anymore.
Being my first novel, I am going to need help with content editing as well to
make sure the book I put out there is in its best form. <i>Another pair of
eyes just won’t do it</i>. They’ve got to be professional and that doesn’t come
cheap. Not only do I need the book reviewed, but most likely I’d need help
formatting it into ePUB format for eBook distribution. Do I even get into the
ins and outs of print publishing or can you only imagine? Print on demand very
well may be the route I take as a self-published author.</p>
<p>We can’t forget about the cover design
now either. That’s got to be weighed with just as much importance. <b>The
book is a form of art and the cover needs to reflect that. </b>The design
will need to encompass the nostalgia and beauty that this story is. A flawless
cover is essential, in my opinion.<i><br/></i></p><p align=""center""><i>So what makes my project special you
ask?</i><br/></p><p>Well, novels have a unique way of transporting a reader to another place.
Perhaps another country. A different era even. It can make one embark on a love
affair they’ve yet to experience their selves. Books also make readers relate
on the most basic human levels and empathize when the situation correlates.</p>
<p>What’s most incredible is that a book can
make a person<i> experience</i> the story wholeheartedly. <i>Feel</i>, even
though it’s fictional. It can get someone to reminisce his or her own
experiences, when a walk down memory lane could be just what a reader is in the
mood for.</p>
<p>And that is what I have set out to do,
because I myself <b>love </b>to read. The experience of delving
completely into a book is amazing; when the whole world fades away and all that
you’ve got happening is the story that is unfolding before your eyes...<i>bliss!</i></p>
<p>With that said, I’d like to share the
stories my mother bestowed upon me. Although I’ve changed it up, plenty <i>actually

</h3> <p>From homelessness to a diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis, Scotty Rushing is no stranger to overcoming challenges. By embracing Henry David Thoreau's philosophy of making a conscious endeavor to succeed, Scotty transformed his obstacles into opportunities and has become an inspiration to thousands of people. Now, Scotty is hoping to share his story with a larger audience by self-publishing his autobiography.</p>
<p>In 2005, Scotty Rushing lost almost everything he owned and became homeless after a job he held for several years came to an end with no warning. Scotty was forced to live in his car for six months while he struggled to find work. One of Scotty's few remaining possessions was an old copy of Henry David Thoreau's <i>Walden</i>. A passage from that book became Scotty's personal motto:</p>
<p><i><b><em>“I know of no more encouraging fact than the unquestionable ability of man to elevate his life by a conscious endeavor.”</em></b></i></p>
<p>With little more than these words to sustain him, Scotty embarked on an effort to reclaim his life and achieve success. He found work as a groom for racehorses in Louisiana, lived in a small tack room, and eventually became a licensed sports agent representing professional jockeys. Scotty embraced his lifelong passion and talent for writing and became a monthly columnist for a nationally-published magazine. </p>
<p>Scotty faced another challenge in 2011 when a minor illness led to a diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis. Despite the pain caused by this debilitating disease, Scotty has continued his work of making a conscious endeavor.<br/></p>
<p>One of Scotty's great regrets was the absence of a college education, so he decided to enroll in school to pursue a degree. After exploring the possibilities of online education by participating in free classes, Scotty became a 45 year-old freshman at the Florida Institute of Technology where he became an academic standout. Scotty was named Outstanding Sophomore in 2014 and inducted as a member of Psi Chi, the International Honor Society for Psychology. After graduating from Florida Tech, Scotty transferred to Arizona State University where he is now pursuing a BA in English.</p>
<p>Scotty Rushing has been featured in publications in the United States and France and has been the subject of short video documentaries. This campaign is designed to help him complete and self-publish his autobiography in the hopes that others will be inspired to overcome their own challenges by making a conscious endeavor.</p>
<p>As a contributor to this campaign you can help Scotty share his story and continue his inspirational work. Scotty is a great example of the power of the human spirit and the ability of an individual to succeed through hard work and dedication to personal excellence. By becoming a contributor you will have played a significant role in encouraging others to succeed.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>How Your Money Helps and What We Can Offer In Return<br/>
</h3> <p>In order to self-publish his autobiography Scotty needs to raise a minimum of $7500. The money will be allocated to the following expenses:<br/></p> <ul> <li>$5000 will be devoted to the printing costs of the book. <br/>
</li> <li>$2000 will be used for promotional expenses including advertising, photos, press kits, and other related expenses.<br/>
</li> <li>$500 will be used to prepare the book for e-reader platforms and make it available in a digital format.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Why Your Contribution Matters</h3>

</li> </ul> </div> </div>","Scotty Rushing's Amazing Journey
 From homelessness to a diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis, Scotty Rushing is no stranger to overcoming challenges. By embracing Henry David Thoreau's philosophy of making a conscious endeavor to succeed, Scotty transformed his obstacles into opportunities and has become an inspiration to thousands of people. Now, Scotty is hoping to share his story with a larger audience by self-publishing his autobiography.
In 2005, Scotty Rushing lost almost everything he owned and became homeless after a job he held for several years came to an end with no warning. Scotty was forced to live in his car for six months while he struggled to find work. One of Scotty's few remaining possessions was an old copy of Henry David Thoreau's Walden. A passage from that book became Scotty's personal motto:
“I know of no more encouraging fact than the unquestionable ability of man to elevate his life by a conscious endeavor.”
With little more than these words to sustain him, Scotty embarked on an effort to reclaim his life and achieve success. He found work as a groom for racehorses in Louisiana, lived in a small tack room, and eventually became a licensed sports agent representing professional jockeys. Scotty embraced his lifelong passion and talent for writing and became a monthly columnist for a nationally-published magazine. 
Scotty faced another challenge in 2011 when a minor illness led to a diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis. Despite the pain caused by this debilitating disease, Scotty has continued his work of making a conscious endeavor.
One of Scotty's great regrets was the absence of a college education, so he decided to enroll in school to pursue a degree. After exploring the possibilities of online education by participating in free classes, Scotty became a 45 year-old freshman at the Florida Institute of Technology where he became an academic standout. Scotty was named Outstanding Sophomore in 2014 and inducted as a member of Psi Chi, the International Honor Society for Psychology. After graduating from Florida Tech, Scotty transferred to Arizona State University where he is now pursuing a BA in English.
Scotty Rushing has been featured in publications in the United States and France and has been the subject of short video documentaries. This campaign is designed to help him complete and self-publish his autobiography in the hopes that others will be inspired to overcome their own challenges by making a conscious endeavor.
As a contributor to this campaign you can help Scotty share his story and continue his inspirational work. Scotty is a great example of the power of the human spirit and the ability of an individual to succeed through hard work and dedication to personal excellence. By becoming a contributor you will have played a significant role in encouraging others to succeed.
  How Your Money Helps and What We Can Offer In Return
 In order to self-publish his autobiography Scotty needs to raise a minimum of $7500. The money will be allocated to the following expenses:  $5000 will be devoted to the printing costs of the book. 
 $2000 will be used for promotional expenses including advertising, photos, press kits, and other related expenses.
 $500 will be used to prepare the book for e-reader platforms and make it available in a digital format.    Why Your Contribution Matters
The power of encouragement in our society cannot be overstated. People need to hear the uplifting stories of others who have endured hardships similar to their own. This project is valuable because it has the power to reinforce self-sufficiency in the face of adversity. Scotty Rushing's life is a testimony to the importance of accepting personal responsibility and creating a life of value. 
Scotty's writing has a very unique voice that comes across as down-to-earth and genuine. His words are crafted to reach a wide variety of readers and motivate them to take action.

film, art and people intrigued me. I would spend most of my free time people
watching and when that wasn't available to me, I watched people through T.V. My
fascination with people turned into a love of the arts people created.
Television shows, I learned rather quickly, came from the minds of people. They
were able to put into words and transfer onto the screen, what they had envisioned
within their minds.</span><br/></p>
<p>I remember seeing Star Wars as a
child. It was so fascinating to me. The odd planets and the strange creatures
that inhabited them. The different ways the characters spoke. The humans or
Jedi and Sith, who could move things with their minds and the interesting
looking alien and mechanical beings they interacted with, who in the story,
weren’t that different from the humans. I remember saying that’s what I want to
do. I want to create stories, worlds and characters that INSPIRE whole
generations. </p>
<p>I would say that my curiosity for
writing stemmed from my childhood of watching foreign and domestic science
fiction, fantasy and horror films. I was especially intrigued by vampire movies
and fancied to call myself a vampire expert at the age of twelve, even though I
might not have been. For me writing and T.V. offered an escape from a household
of domestic violence. T.V. was my safe haven, a place where characters of shows
were my non-judgmental friends.</p>
<p>Shows like Xena: Warrior Princess,
Hercules: The Legendary Journeys, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and Murder She
Wrote (my grandmother’s favorite) were on my daily watch list. And movies like
Star Wars, The Matrix, Devdas, Azumi, and Harry Potter, became some of my
biggest sources of inspiration. Though my first forms of writing were poetry, I
now find myself writing science fiction and fantasy novels as well as
screenplays.</p>

Alle klagen über schlechte Literatur, aber niemand bemüht sich um konstruktive Kritik und nachvollziehbare Bewertungskriterien. Jedenfalls niemand außer uns.In Klagenfurt traten auch 2014 wieder 14 Autorinnen und Autoren bei den Tagen der deutschsprachigen Literatur zum öffentlichen Wettlesen an. Eine Jury aus Literaturfachleuten bestimmt dort vor laufenden Kameras mehrere Gewinner. Weil man als Zuschauer nicht immer nachvollziehen kann, ob ein Text jetzt ""rhizomatisch"" oder eine ""Engführung gelungen"" ist oder nicht, ergänzt seit 2008 der Automatische Literaturkritik Preis das Geschehen. Mit Hilfe einer transparenten und leicht anwendbaren Liste von Plus-und Minuspunkten wird ein Preisträgertext ermittelt.Ob dieser Text dann auch wirklich der beste ist, weiß man nicht – genau wie bei den Jurypreisen. Aber dass er den Preis zu Recht bekommen hat, ist garantiert und lässt sich anhand der Kriterienliste jederzeit nachprüfen.In vielen Jahren haben die Gewinner des ALK-Preises danach noch andere Preise gewonnen (etwa Tilman Rammstedt, der außerdem mit dem Bachmannpreis und dem Publikumspreis ausgezeichnet wurde), in manchen Jahren aber auch nicht. Und weil es uns schmerzte, die Autoren in diesen anderen Jahren nur mit einer – wenn auch sehr hübschen – Urkunde und 500 Euro nach Hause gehen zu sehen, wurde das Preisgeld 2014 durch Crowdfunding aufgebracht. So konnten wir Michael Fehr am 6.

Informationen zum Crowdfunding 2014, hier hinterlassen: Was haben die Spender davon?
Die Spender erwarten Prämien (sogenannte ""Perks""), die man nicht kaufen kann (jedenfalls nicht zu solchen Preisen): Hervorragende Bücher, von namhaften Literaturbetriebsmitgliedern benutzte Schwimmtiere oder eine luxuriöse Tretbootfahrt auf dem Wörthersee, aber auch Unikate wie eigens gedichtete Sonette von Clemens J. Setz, die Originalzeichnung ""Burkhard Spinnen findet ein Haar im Text"" von Tex Rubinowitz, bewährt bachmannpreisgewinnbringende Unterwäsche und ein so gut wie unveröffentlichter Eichhörnchentext von Martin Fritz (aka Mauszfabrick). Das gestiftete Geld
wird fast vollständig an die Preisträgerin oder den Preisträger ausgeschüttet, auch wenn mehr oder weniger als 5000 Euro eingehen. Wir ziehen nur einen kleinen Betrag für die Finanzierung von Perks bzw. deren Versand und Transaktionskosten (indiegogo) ab. Die Perks stammen überwiegend aus Sachspenden. Die Perks werden gespendet von

<h3><strong>What the Campaign is About: To get help and raise $2,500 to self-publish my next book, a thriller called The List. </strong></h3>
<p>There are two ways to live a life – in theory or in practice. One involves talking about what might happen and the other requires taking risks and letting go of the outcome. I was stuck in the first camp for a long time, which meant I preferred to turn over most of the work, the rewards and what I saw as the risk of failure to a traditional publishing house. The results are Wired, The Sitting Sisters and A Place to Call Home – three great books that have been well received. It seemed like enough.</p>
<p>But then in 2009 I was told I had cancer and only a one percent chance of living longer than one more year. I walked out of the doctor’s office shaking, trying to come up with something comforting to say to my 21-year-old son, Louie. Instead, he looked at me and said very firmly, “You weren’t listening. They said there was hope.” Something clicked and I realized that I was going to have to figure out how to be present for every day I had left rather than stare at my death.</p>
<p>It turns out that for now the doctors were wrong about the year but I’ve had four more operations for cancer since then. I’ve had to learn how to live with cancer without making it the focus and to be grateful for the rewards that come along with being reminded that life isn’t a guarantee.</p>
<p>The biggest reward I’ve gotten so far is learning how to ask for help from friends and family. At times I’ve really needed it because I couldn’t walk very well or because my face was bandaged and I couldn’t speak. I’ve learned that help can also be about just needing comfort and company like watching a scary movie with friends or throwing together a potluck or learning how to ride a bike again. That one took four spectacular spills but eventually I stayed on the bike. This past year I even started acting like I plan to live a long time and lost 86 pounds.</p>
<p>It doesn’t have to be complicated.</p>
<p>So, I’m doing my best to let go of old ideas about everything and learn to live in the moment. To make writing more about why I started - to share something – including the journey to get the book in your hands as well as every conversation afterwards. If you want to join in you can take a look at the different things you can get by making a donation. You can even be a part of what is turning into an amazing journey just by letting your friends know about The List Campaign. Share the link by using the share buttons on this site.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your ongoing love and support. I am really looking forward to seeing what comes next, whatever it is – and to walking through it, to enjoying it with all of you.</p>
<h3>
<strong>What the Book is About</strong>:</h3>
<p>The List is a novel of suspense about a happy family caught between two old political powers that have always existed behind the scenes, invisible to most of the public. The two sides have battled over control for hundreds of years actively recruiting new members at a young age to groom them for politics, Wall Street, Corporate corner offices and the military. Good Old Boy networks, private clubs and political action committees were all formed with the same idea in mind to grease the wheels of life because we all want to ensure a nice, fat piece of the American pie, especially for our children. However, families find out a little too late that once they’ve joined there’s no out clause.</p>

<h1>The story</h1>
<p><b>Please, close your eyes and start your imagination!</b></p>
<p><b>Imagine the smells and fragrances of once upon a time.</b> Imagine an old stone mansion <b>built before 1500</b>, in the center of a village <b>perched at 1300 meters</b> above sea level.</p>
<p>Now imagine a <b>grandmother</b>, a nice little old lady with the strength of two truckers, who <b>kneads bread</b> and then cooks it in the <b>huge wood-fired oven</b> in the house.</p>
<p><b>Can you hear the dry wood crackling</b>, the <b>smell of tomato sauce</b> for the lasagna baking, the <b>smell of bread slowly baking</b> in the oven?</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/764619/files/20140804040604-imgGrannysHome.jpg?1407150364"" src="""" style=""""/></p><i><b>Granny Gioconda's Home</b></i>
<p><br/></p><p>Well, I remember very well, because I was is in the group of children who entered like a herd of buffalo and with the hunger of a mountain lion. Five, ten children, brothers, cousins, friends entering in the middle of a summer afternoon with only one thought in mind: hunger!</p>
<p>My grandmother, calmly and with a smile of happiness, began to slice huge slices of bread, still warm. Imagine each of those slices as long as an arm of a child, warm and crisp.</p>
<p>Then, with the water pitcher, she watered each slice with the right amount of water and finally distributing the sugar on every centimeter of bread.</p>
<p>It is not difficult to imagine that, for a good ten minutes in the house of Grandma she did not feel a fly.</p><p><br/></p>
<h1>When Grandma Gioconda put a Nazi commander in his place!</h1>
<p><b>Born in 1897 in St. Stefano of Sessanio, she is no longer with us since 1991, after spending 94 years as only a true Abruzzo bear can do.</b></p>
<p>In his life she always had to work and struggle to live and maintain <b>their 5 children</b> along with <b>the ever present and taciturn grandfather Ferdinand</b>.</p>
<p>I want to tell only a small event, to make you understand what that woman was hardening. <b>In 1944, St. Stefano was occupied by the Nazis</b> and made ​​it an outpost for communications.</p>
<p>The village at that time was, like many other villages in Italy, <b>mainly self-sufficient</b> because they were able to produce the food necessary to the life of the population. Fruits, vegetables, meat, sausages, cereals, cheese, bread, everything was produced and processed in the village. There were only few who could afford ""luxury"" goods and cars could be counted on the fingers of one hand.</p>
<p>With the arrival of the Nazis, <b>the population was enslaved and forced to work</b> to supply the military contingent stationed. Grandma told me that it <b>was a period of considerable hardship</b>, with little food and a lot of fear. <b>By that time the Nazi massacre in the village of Onna, a few kilometers away.</b></p>
<p>Grandmother Gioconda worked in the oven to bake bread daily and she usually sent one of his sons to deliver bread to the command and the radio station.</p>
<p>That day it fell to my <b>Uncle Nicola, age 7</b>, to deliver the bread to the radio station installed <b>on the Medici Tower, 20 meters high</b>.</p>
<p><b>The tower</b> of St. Stefano <b>was renovated in the 80s</b> and <b>collapsed in the earthquake of 2009</b>. Prior to the restructuring, I remember it perfectly, to climb the tower stairs were <b>made ​​of wood</b>, <b>stuck to spiral</b> around the circumference and <b>without protection</b>.</p>
<p>It went up by<b> 8 yards up to the first platform</b>, then for another <b>10 yards up to the top of the tower</b>. I do not suffer from vertigo but I can assure you that it was very dangerous and it took courage to climb.</p>
<p>My uncle tells me that, <b>just come on top</b> with four loaves of bread that weighed almost as much as him, <b>one of the soldiers began to tease him</b>. He was a child and did not speak German, so can not tell us what they wanted, <b>but at some point he was picked up and held back only by the ankle, leaning out from the battlements of the tower amidst the laughter of the German soldiers.</b></p>
<p><b>Can you imagine, 22-yards cliff on the sharp rocks of the Apennines, the screams and the horror in the eyes of that little boy.</b></p>
<p><b>When he came home in tears told what had happened to my grandmother who ran the command and, making their way among the armed soldiers, entered shoting the office of the Nazi commander.</b> </p><p>She has never wanted to say how she did it and what was said, the fact is that she obtained a public apology from the commander, an apology from the soldier and, since then, they had no more problems until the day of the retreat of the Germans.</p>
<p><b>A woman of the past, and with a temper out of the ordinary. I collected so many other testimonies about her life and I hope to be able to insert as many cameos in the upcoming book.</b></p>

Please, close your eyes and start your imagination!
Imagine the smells and fragrances of once upon a time. Imagine an old stone mansion built before 1500, in the center of a village perched at 1300 meters above sea level.
Now imagine a grandmother, a nice little old lady with the strength of two truckers, who kneads bread and then cooks it in the huge wood-fired oven in the house.

Well, I remember very well, because I was is in the group of children who entered like a herd of buffalo and with the hunger of a mountain lion. Five, ten children, brothers, cousins, friends entering in the middle of a summer afternoon with only one thought in mind: hunger!

It went up by 8 yards up to the first platform, then for another 10 yards up to the top of the tower. I do not suffer from vertigo but I can assure you that it was very dangerous and it took courage to climb.
My uncle tells me that, just come on top with four loaves of bread that weighed almost as much as him, one of the soldiers began to tease him.

Some words on Santo Stefano di Sessanio
Far from me the idea to write here a sneak copy of Wikipedia, what can I say is that St. Stefano is a must see place, almost one time in life.
Actually is like a hitted lion, full of signs of the terrible hearthquake of five years ago. Reconstruction is made difficult becase each single house is connected and embedded in other buildings. The whole village was built centuries ago as a continuous wall for protection reasons.

<b>“A powerful yet very accessible voice - just right for telling stories.” </b> - <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Margot C. - Glasgow U.K.</span>
</blockquote><p>My book -<i> <b>Somewhere in a Town You Never Knew Existed Somewhere</b>,</i> is a quirky collection of prose pieces, and a book that wanted to write itself. The characters implored me to speak about injustice, vulnerability, and sensitivity in a world that reveres power and force. They wanted me to speak directly to society's ""elephants"" in the living room - through kooky hooliganism and satire. And in allowing the voices of small children, elephants, cows, butterflies, and the broken hearted to speak through me, the book became a voice for the voiceless, calling out gentle songs for this fragile place we call home.

“A powerful yet very accessible voice - just right for telling stories.”  - Margot C. - Glasgow U.K.
My book - Somewhere in a Town You Never Knew Existed Somewhere, is a quirky collection of prose pieces, and a book that wanted to write itself. The characters implored me to speak about injustice, vulnerability, and sensitivity in a world that reveres power and force. They wanted me to speak directly to society's ""elephants"" in the living room - through kooky hooliganism and satire. And in allowing the voices of small children, elephants, cows, butterflies, and the broken hearted to speak through me, the book became a voice for the voiceless, calling out gentle songs for this fragile place we call home. I care deeply about the earth and our environment, and this book is dedicated to that cause. My name is Nina Hart, and I’m seeking support to publish my first book and strategize and launch tours where I will perform pieces from the book, and offer workshops. I love to speak these stories out loud  - and I’m excited to share the zany wisdom of the voice that finds its way through me (and anyone if they will let it) because I’ve seen how powerfully its expression touches others and inspires them to unleash their own creative impulses onto the world. I believe that’s what this world needs more of: creative people who trust their childish muse.Praise for Nina's Writing:""Nina Hart is a writer and mentor and community activist like no other.

<p>Hello, folks! On 6th-7th October 2015 I'm going to be writing 100 poems in 48 hours to raise money for <a href=""http://www.thebookbus.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Book Bus</a>, a wonderful charity that sends mobile libraries to communities in various places across Africa, Asia and South America to help children learn to read, provide teaching materials and create school libraries.  </p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<ul><li>On the 6th-7th I'll be posting the poems online as I write them at <a href=""http://100poemchallenge.blogspot.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://100poemchallenge.blogspot.com</a> Before then, if you'd like to, please <a href=""http://www.twitter.com/aeroplanegirl"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">tweet me</a> tag words using the hashtag #100PoemChallenge - I'll use some of these as titles of poems or to spark off ideas when the time comes.</li></ul>
<p></p>
<ul><li>Any amount that you could donate would be very much appreciated: £1, £2, whatever you can spare. I've set the goal at £1000 but I would love to raise as much money as possible - as I'm sure you'll agree: stories are a huge part of what makes us who we are, and reading is a skill that should be available to every child.</li></ul>
<ul><li>There are also two perks that you can purchase: a handwritten poem on a postcard at £5 (I'll be handwriting each of the 100 poems on postcards after the event) and a limited edition poetry pamphlet of all of the poems for £10. Both of these can be shipped to anywhere in the world. All proceeds go to The Book Bus.</li></ul>

Working mainly with rural schools in Zambia, Malawi, India and Ecuador, our volunteer crew divide huge classes into small groups and inspire the children to read by personalizing the reading experience through story-telling, assisted reading practice and creative arts. This simple and effective support is sustained by provision of books and resources to each school library. Each Book Bus and its volunteer crew supports a cluster of five schools for up to three months. We make weekly visits to these schools working with up to 800 children from the cluster.

Hello, folks! On 6th-7th October 2015 I'm going to be writing 100 poems in 48 hours to raise money for The Book Bus, a wonderful charity that sends mobile libraries to communities in various places across Africa, Asia and South America to help children learn to read, provide teaching materials and create school libraries.  

On the 6th-7th I'll be posting the poems online as I write them at http://100poemchallenge.blogspot.com Before then, if you'd like to, please tweet me tag words using the hashtag #100PoemChallenge - I'll use some of these as titles of poems or to spark off ideas when the time comes.

Any amount that you could donate would be very much appreciated: £1, £2, whatever you can spare. I've set the goal at £1000 but I would love to raise as much money as possible - as I'm sure you'll agree: stories are a huge part of what makes us who we are, and reading is a skill that should be available to every child.
There are also two perks that you can purchase: a handwritten poem on a postcard at £5 (I'll be handwriting each of the 100 poems on postcards after the event) and a limited edition poetry pamphlet of all of the poems for £10. Both of these can be shipped to anywhere in the world. All proceeds go to The Book Bus.
  About The Book Bus 

See recent amazing activity from The Book Bus on their Facebook and Twitter

& from their website:

The Book Bus supports schools by providing mobile library facilities and volunteer story-tellers to help children become confident and literate readers for life. Working mainly with rural schools in Zambia, Malawi, India and Ecuador, our volunteer crew divide huge classes into small groups and inspire the children to read by personalizing the reading experience through story-telling, assisted reading practice and creative arts. This simple and effective support is sustained by provision of books and resources to each school library. Each Book Bus and its volunteer crew supports a cluster of five schools for up to three months. We make weekly visits to these schools working with up to 800 children from the cluster. The project finishes with an end of term party and opening of a new school library.Registered Charity No: 1117357About JenJen Campbell is the Sunday Times bestselling author of the ‘Weird Things Customers Say in Bookshops’ series and ‘The Bookshop Book.’ She’s also an award-winning poet and short story writer; her poetry pamphlet 'The Hungry Ghost Festival' is published by The Rialto, and she runs a Youtube channel over at www.youtube.com/jenvcampbell where she discusses all things books.

<p></p>
<p>The purpose of this campaign is to provide schools and youth
organizations with a FREE updated digital version of the Whiz Teens in Business
book, a book for kids and teenagers who want to start their own business. The book has started being used by schools and has even been bought by the The Montgomery Alabama School Board for their students, through the Small Business development Center, College of Business Administration of the Alabama State University.</p>
<p>A new cover is being created, illustrations inside the book
are being replaced, the chapter on using technology for doing business is being
updated and a couple of 
very important chapters are being added to
discuss self-esteem, limiting emotions and the proper mindset for success.</p>
<p>A PR and email campaign will be done to inform schools and youth
organizations of the free interactive PDF format for their students and
members.</p>
<p>Included in the interactive digital book are online videos
demonstrating more complex topics such as making a budget and revenue
projections. For the Table of Contents, go to <a href=""http://www.whizventures.com/whizteenstoc.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.whizventures.com/whizteenstoc.html</a></p>

<p><b>About Myself</b></p>
<p>I have always been an entrepreneur for as long as I can
remember. I started writing books when I was 14. I started working for a large
telecommunication company when I was 18.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, being self-employed myself, I started an
association for self-employed people who were practically persecuted at the
time, myself included. We were considered pariahs with no regular income,
working out of the dark basement. For instance, in those days, when the
telephone company found out you were working from home it cut off your home
phone service with no warning and forced you to subscribe to an expensive
commercial service. So, with a colleague mine, we were able to completely
reverse the situation and obtain recognition for self-employed people from
governments, financial institutions and telecommunication companies. Several
government programs were created based on our research and our work.</p>
<p>In those days I also started taking full advantage of what
the early Web and first commercial browser had to offer, because I saw from
early on the potential it had for small businesses. During that time I built on
the knowledge and experience I already had and realized that this information
could definitely benefit young people.  To
view my full bio, go to <a href=""http://www.whizventures.com/bio.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.whizventures.com/bio.html</a></p>
<p>The job market has been very difficult for several years and
even decades now. Young people need to have some hope and know that they don’t
need to necessarily depend on employers to accomplish great things. All they
need is some ideas and the necessary knowledge.</p>
<p>I have worked in small businesses and large corporations and
have an extensive knowledge of business and the Web, and I am specialized in online learning. I wrote “Leading Your Business Into the Future With the
Internet” in 1999. Unfortunately, one makes little or no money when dealing
with publishers.</p>
<p>This is why I wrote and self-published the first edition of
the Whiz Teens in Business book. I wanted to share my business knowledge with
those who needed it the most. The first paperback edition of the book was
purchased by several schools and is used by teachers to teach business
principles to young people. This book needs to become more widely available in

schools worldwide.</p>
<p>The upcoming 2014 edition of the book contains additional
chapters and will be available in several formats. First, new Web and social
media information needs to be added to the technology chapter. Second,
self-esteem, dealing with limiting emotions and having the right mindset are
crucial in order to be successful, so a couple of chapters are being added to
show how to program the mind for success. And the cover has been redesigned to
reflect today’s reality more closely.</p>
But the main features of this book are that it
will take full advantage of technology by integrating tutorials right inside
the book. And this campaign is to make the book available for free to schools and youth organizations that
want to use it in their curriculum. <p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I Need</h3><p>
</p><p>Material like new photos and illustrations for preparing a book
is expensive, and so is producing interactive material for the book. Making
resources available on the Internet is not free. Reaching out to the vast
network of schools and libraries is very costly. Furthermore, when things are
offered for free, they may not be perceived as having any value. But having the
Whiz Teens in Business book sponsored in a major way gives it an added value for those who receive it.</p>
<p>The campaign consists in obtaining lists of contacts, sending out emails to schools and youth organizations, sending out press releases, social media activity and word of mouth. I need your help to accomplish this.</p><p></p><h3>What You Get</h3><p></p>
<p>Whether all or part of the funds is raised, the book will be published and distributed. Not raising all of the funds will simply make the book distribution process slower, and more funds will mean that the distribution can be accelerated with more help. It may also allow me to make personal appearances when requested, to talk to future entrepreneurs.</p><p>$5 – Gets you my deep gratitude and an advanced copy of the digital book.</p><p>$10 –  Gets you an advanced copy of the digital book and your name in the book as a supporter.</p>

While overcoming cultural obstacles they both tell their story with doses of humor and irony. This story will open a window to the Korean culture as well as to the relationship between the two travelers.

It made me realize how open minded I have to be in everything in life. This book tells the story of Korea from a different angle and will tell you about things you don't usually read in a guide book. Just like sitting with friends over coffee and listening to their tale about the last vacation they took in a funny, revealing  and honest way. </div><div>   With the help I will be getting from you, dear contributors, I will be able to publish the book through a self-publishing agency. This book later can be bought by any bookstore, kindle or other version of E-book and get to as many people as possible.

I hope that six months from now, you will be able to see this book on the shelves in your favorite bookstore's travel section. The aim is to raise $2500 which is the publishing deal I was offered. This book will be published ""By hook or by crook', as we say, so any amount of money I will raise will go to the publishing.
    I would appreciate your help by funding but also by talking about this campaign. Let your friends know about it. People who love to travel, people who have been to Korea or know Korean people, people who love to laugh and even just mothers with teenaged boys or anyone who has seen PSY with his song 'Kangnam Style'.

point, turned to me and said: 'Your

it was my parental responsibility to teach the chick some manners so I asked
him to thank the good lady. The chick, with a lovely smile, turned and from

<h3></h3>
<p>Hello. My name is Jaidon Wells. I’m a professional LGBTQIA romance writer, and I’m staring down the face of eventual disability.</p>
<p>In May of 2012, I was injured at my job in an assisted living home, a knee injury that required two and a half months of physical therapy to get me walking again. At the time, my orthopedist advised me to pass over surgery to repair what he said was minor damage to the knee—listening to that advice turned out to be an incredibly stupid mistake.</p>
<p>A year later, I got a desperately needed second job as an assisted manager in a restaurant, which requires me to work 12 hour shifts on my feet. What started out as minor knee pain after my shifts has progressed to constant, severe pain and the need to wear a knee brace at all times just to be able to walk. The damage to my knee my orthopedist told me was minor has turned out to be anything but and only becomes worse every time I walk. I’ve been told that elective surgery is no longer optional: either I get it now or the damage to my knee continues to compound every time I’m on my feet until, eventually, I won’t be able to walk, at all. </p>
<p>The problem? I have no health insurance and work two low wage jobs, neither of which is legally required to help me under workers comp laws in Texas. I have to pay for the surgery out of pocket and no matter what way I look at it, I’m going to come out several thousand dollars short of paying for it myself.</p>
<p>I don’t want handouts, though. So what I decided to do in exchange for donations was to put my writing skills to use: I’m opening up to commissions of any sort (the price ranges of which are listed as perks). If you’d like to commission me just choose whichever perk your heart may desire, then take a screenshot of your donation confirmation page and attach it to an email with your story prompt and anything you might specifically want to see in it in the body of the email to jaidonwells(at)outlook(dot)com. I will email your completed story back to whatever address the email is sent from, so be sure that it’s one you check. I will send you a confirmation that I’ve received your prompt when I get it.</p>
<p>Other authors and artists doing commissions for this project are listed on <a href=""http://keepjaidonwalking.tumblr.com/commissions"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">this page.</a> Should you wish to commission one of them instead simply make a donation here for the appropriate amount, screenshot your donation confirmation, and submit it along with what you would like to commission from them to their personal blogs (all linked from that page, aside from Travis, who can be contacted through that blog).</p>
<p><b>EDIT</b>: The amazing <a href=""sashalmiller.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sasha Miller</a> is now doing commissions for this project. Her commission prices are the same as those listed on this page, but she has a few rules in regards to what she'll write (which is strictly original fiction):</p>
<p></p>
<p>Commission nets the commissioner one story dedicated to them and based on a prompt from them. Prompts can include characters from an existing ‘verse of hers or something original, but she won’t write something that interferes with (1) sequel or WIP plans or (2) canon for existing stories. Commissioners can offer multiple prompts, in which case she will try to incorporate as many as possible or pick from the offered prompts. She writes all genres and across the LGBTQ spectrum. She does not write dub/non-con, character torture and does not guarantee any sexually explicit content. Stories will be delivered within a year of the commission drive ending (and probably much sooner).</p>

~~~to help an artist
see their project come to life

Some time ago, deep in my heart, I came upon a wellspring of Haiku. There were times when couldn't get them on to the paper before another one came. There is nothing conventional about these Haiku (aside from the 5, 7, 5) but  each holds a valuable piece of wisdom gleaned from my 
life of wonder and fulfillment. 

I sat on them for some time, not sure how to share them with others. 
A book? That didn't really feel right.
Then it came...
 Of course!!! A deck of inspirational cards. 
 

 
Writing the haiku was the easy part. Then there was choosing which to include. I was so 
connected to each one that it wasn't easy to just pick fifty or so. Manhandling Indesign and Illustrator  took months, and quite a bit of blood, sweat, and tears... But I did it! 

 
I have compiled the haiku. Completed the artwork, layout and set-up of a deck of cards fifty+ in all. They are ready for print. Like so many projects- they are waiting for the finances for 
production to materialize. 

 
That's where you come in...
 

 
I realized that although it felt good to do it all by myself; it was time to really open up to others 
and allow support. One of the bravest things one can do is ask for help. And a wonderful way to 
offer an opportunity to be of assistance. Now it's time to bring these babies to print!





what I give to you


comes back to me in my heart
and so I give more

 


When I share my observations with another person, and they feel invigorated, or wiser, or just a little bit better than they did before they came, then I gain from that experience as well. It is a sharing, and hopefully a receiving that benefits everyone involved. I look forward to the opportunity to turn the wheels in a few more minds... maybe start up a few conversations.I hope to see these cards inspire may people to look inside for more questions. It's the only way to find the answers. 








how bout we call it
the new way to start a biz
pre-sale with some perks
 
My goal is to wholesale the deck and get it out to stores ASAP. In order to do that they must sell at wholesale cost. When it comes to printing, the more you print, the cheaper the cost. Only thing is, the more you print, the more you have to outlay. So even though it is less per piece, one has to buy more pieces.  Thus the costly upstart costs of self publishing.   I have found my printer, and I am Excited! Where is the money from this campaign going? What happens if I do not reach my goal, you ask? Below is the breakdown including boxing, shrink wrapping each deck and shipping to me (I will cover all shipping costs to fulfill any perk you claim) :  



When I reach my goal ($8,500) I print 2500 decks at a cost that allows me to wholesale a fair and reasonable price (half of the wholesale rate    while creating the capital to promote the deck and perhaps print a second run.

 

If I reach only part of my goal I will print as many decks as I am able to do so with the funds raised. 


Whether or not my goal is reached, I will honor every perk claimed. I have every intention of publishing Haiku for Thought, it is just a matter of when in 2012 that is. Everyone who contributes to this campaign will see their fruition, and I can't wait to fulfill!!

 Zakkum (“oleander” in Turkish) is a graphic murder mystery about 
family, loyalty, love, cultural etiquette and taboos. The narrator, an 
artist in her early 30s, lives in Amsterdam. A letter arrives one day 
from her favourite aunt in Istanbul with a cry for help, only to be 
followed soon after with news of the aunt’s death. Alarmed by this 
unusual coincidence, she sets off to investigate a possible murder in a 
city she knows only from childhood holidays and a recent love affair. 
Family secrets, poisonous plants, and a blinding dislike for her uncle, 
lead the narrator to jump to the wrong conclusion! Humorous and moving, 
Zakkum is a unique story and a refreshing glimpse into gay life in 
Istanbul.</p>

<p>Sono un fotografo, un fotografo che vola. <br/>Un viaggiatore che fotografa e vola, da solo, con un parapendio a motore.</p>
<p>Il progetto Cieli d'Italia nasce sulla scorta del primo grande viaggio realizzato <a href=""https://lozenelartedelvoloinparamotore.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">lungo il corso del Po </a> </p>
<p>Il fine: raccontare l'Italia, ma da un punto di vista differente. Dal cielo</p>
<p>Il progetto del volo lungo il Po è stato pienamente autoprodotto, leggendo il resoconto del viaggio sul blog è chiaramente visibile come sono stati gli incontri casuali, gratuiti e non combinati, ad arricchire e soprattutto rendere sostenibile il viaggio. Ogni persona incontrata lungo il viaggio ha contribuito a suo modo a farmi raggiungere l'obiettivo. Un panino, qualche litro di benzina, una roulotte dismessa per passare la notte: piccoli gesti che hanno donato ricchezza al viaggio. A sua volta un viaggio nato per raccontare il corso di un fiume è diventato - inaspettatamente - un pretesto per raccontare le sue genti, la ricchezza umana di chi lo vive.</p>
<p>Ecco perchè il crowdfunding: un piccolo contributo prima della partenza, una sicurezza per fare rifornimento ed assicurarsi un pasto. Nulla di più.<br/>Così come lungo il Po ogni persona incontrata è diventata protagonista e compagno di viaggio - seppur per una piccola parte di esso - grazie al crowdfunding mi piace l'idea di trovare tanti compagni di viaggio che contribuiranno a questa esperienza, condividendola con loro. Ognuno avrà un ""perk"", una ""gratificazione"". Sia essa una stampa, o quanto è possibile dare in cambio.</p>
<p>Il viaggio sarà raccontato ""in diretta"" dal 25 agosto: come lungo il Po ogni giorno il blog sarà aggiornato con testi e fotografie del Diario di Bordo di giornata. Questa volta arricchito da video, interviste, ed il making of, accessibili tramite un'are riservata.</p>
<p><br/><br/>E' un periodo in cui vogliamo lasciare l'Italia, abbandonarla, fuggire, andare all'estero. Io non ho mai amato tanto l'Italia e gli italiani come nell'ultimo viaggio. Voglio ripeterlo, e questa volta lungo tutta l'Italia, e coinvolgere per quanto possibile ogni persona a terra che sia disponibile ed interessata a farlo.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Cosa è necessario, come puoi contribuire</h3>
<p>Il bussiness plan è molto semplice: in questo momento abbiamo un piano di volo di massima, per quanto è possibile prevedere un viaggio sottoposto a numerose variabili: soprattutto quelle metereologiche.<br/>La cifra che intendiamo raggiungere (meno di 2.500 euro)ci servirà per il carburante (benzina e olio per la miscela), e per contribuire alle spese vive di un umile ma funzionante ufficio stampa (non ci piace far lavorare la gente soltanto per la gloria...), il tutto per almeno un mese e mezzo circa.</p>
Chi contribuisce può farlo con un sostegno economico tramite questa iniziativa, in cambio di una stampa autografata, di una copia del libro, o assicurandosi l'elica in legno usata durante il viaggio (è anche un bel soprammobile: io ne ho una in salotto).</div>
<div>Oppure può sostenere l'iniziativa ospitandomi per una notte, o con un panino o un piatto di pasta. Sono ben accetti anche i sostegni puramente morali ed il tifo.<br/><br/>
</div>
<div>Il progetto partirà se viene raggiunto almeno il 50% della cifra necessaria. La restante parte sarà eventualmente ricercata con altri mezzi (sponsor, autofinanziamento, vendita di stampe e libro ad amici che non usano internet...).<br/>Nel caso in cui la cifra non raggiunga la quota del 50% l'ammontare sarà versato all'Associazione Nazionale Vigili del Fuoco Volontari: sono un pompiere volontario, e i soldi che arrivano dal Ministero non sono mai abbastanza...almeno garantiranno un po' di gasolio per l'autopompa...</div>
<div>
<h3>Le finalità</h3>
Un Road Book (cartaceo ed e-book) che raccoglierà le immagini dell'Italia vista dal cielo e la storia dell'avventura e delle persone che avranno partecipato alla sua realizzazione.</div>
<div>Come già fatto, per il Po, sul blog <a rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://lozenelartedelvoloinparamotore.com/</a>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Il libro conterà 96 pagine, stampato su carta 150 gr/mq, la lavorazione garantita da un fornitore abituale e di qualità.</div>

A sua volta un viaggio nato per raccontare il corso di un fiume è diventato - inaspettatamente - un pretesto per raccontare le sue genti, la ricchezza umana di chi lo vive.
Ecco perchè il crowdfunding: un piccolo contributo prima della partenza, una sicurezza per fare rifornimento ed assicurarsi un pasto. Nulla di più.Così come lungo il Po ogni persona incontrata è diventata protagonista e compagno di viaggio - seppur per una piccola parte di esso - grazie al crowdfunding mi piace l'idea di trovare tanti compagni di viaggio che contribuiranno a questa esperienza, condividendola con loro. Ognuno avrà un ""perk"", una ""gratificazione"". Sia essa una stampa, o quanto è possibile dare in cambio.
Il viaggio sarà raccontato ""in diretta"" dal 25 agosto: come lungo il Po ogni giorno il blog sarà aggiornato con testi e fotografie del Diario di Bordo di giornata. Questa volta arricchito da video, interviste, ed il making of, accessibili tramite un'are riservata.
E' un periodo in cui vogliamo lasciare l'Italia, abbandonarla, fuggire, andare all'estero. Io non ho mai amato tanto l'Italia e gli italiani come nell'ultimo viaggio. Voglio ripeterlo, e questa volta lungo tutta l'Italia, e coinvolgere per quanto possibile ogni persona a terra che sia disponibile ed interessata a farlo.


 
Cosa è necessario, come puoi contribuire
Il bussiness plan è molto semplice: in questo momento abbiamo un piano di volo di massima, per quanto è possibile prevedere un viaggio sottoposto a numerose variabili: soprattutto quelle metereologiche.La cifra che intendiamo raggiungere (meno di 2.500 euro)ci servirà per il carburante (benzina e olio per la miscela), e per contribuire alle spese vive di un umile ma funzionante ufficio stampa (non ci piace far lavorare la gente soltanto per la gloria...), il tutto per almeno un mese e mezzo circa.
Chi contribuisce può farlo con un sostegno economico tramite questa iniziativa, in cambio di una stampa autografata, di una copia del libro, o assicurandosi l'elica in legno usata durante il viaggio (è anche un bel soprammobile: io ne ho una in salotto).
Oppure può sostenere l'iniziativa ospitandomi per una notte, o con un panino o un piatto di pasta. Sono ben accetti anche i sostegni puramente morali ed il tifo.

Il progetto partirà se viene raggiunto almeno il 50% della cifra necessaria. La restante parte sarà eventualmente ricercata con altri mezzi (sponsor, autofinanziamento, vendita di stampe e libro ad amici che non usano internet...).Nel caso in cui la cifra non raggiunga la quota del 50% l'ammontare sarà versato all'Associazione Nazionale Vigili del Fuoco Volontari: sono un pompiere volontario, e i soldi che arrivano dal Ministero non sono mai abbastanza...almeno garantiranno un po' di gasolio per l'autopompa...

Le finalità
Un Road Book (cartaceo ed e-book) che raccoglierà le immagini dell'Italia vista dal cielo e la storia dell'avventura e delle persone che avranno partecipato alla sua realizzazione.
Come già fatto, per il Po, sul blog http://lozenelartedelvoloinparamotore.com/

 
Il libro conterà 96 pagine, stampato su carta 150 gr/mq, la lavorazione garantita da un fornitore abituale e di qualità.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><span class=""notranlsate"">Hello, I'm Tricia Rose Burt, director of I Will Be Good Productions, an enterprise I established for my creative projects. Here's the latest:<br/></span></p>
<p>In December 2010, I performed a five-minute vignette from my one-woman show <em>I Will Be Good</em> at a Moth StorySLAM in NYC (that’s the video above). The Moth is a national storytelling collective that <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> calls New York’s “hottest, hippest, literary event.” The show chronicles my journey from a rule-following corporate executive raised in the south to a lateral-thinking contemporary artist living up north. From that first Moth appearance, momentum immediately began to build:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Moth featured my StorySLAM performance on the Peabody Award-winning <em>The Moth Radio Hour, </em>which is broadcast on NPR stations nationwide.</li>
<li>The Moth then podcast a <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br0MNFXpqzU&amp;feature=youtu.be"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Long Version: How to Draw a Nekkid Man"">longer version</a> of the story, which was downloaded <strong>more than a quarter million times</strong> and generated <strong>more than 15,000 hits</strong> on my website in one week. Numerous blogs featured either the podcast or the YouTube video of the performance. Emails poured in (and still do), from listeners stating how much the story resonates with their lives.</li>
<li>At the same time the podcast aired, my one-woman show appeared in the 15<sup>th</sup> Annual New York International Fringe Festival. Two critical things happened during that run: 1) I am now represented by a leading theater agent, who is helping bring the show back to the stage, summer 2013; and 2) a very prominent literary agent attended the show and thinks the play will make an important book. I am currently working with her on the first stages of the manuscript.</li>
</ul><p>I need your help in funding a sabbatical year, or at least some part of a year, to devote full time to writing that book -- my memoir, <em>How to Draw a Nekkid Man</em>.</p>
<p><strong>The Need</strong></p>
<p>The good news is I live in the NH woods, where it is quiet and there are few distractions, an ideal environment for a writer. The bad news is I live in the NH woods, where it is quiet and there are few distractions, a less than ideal environment for supplementing an artist’s income. Since moving here 13 years ago, I’ve held nearly a dozen part-time jobs including the typist for the local newspaper, an art school gallery director, and most recently, as a personal assistant to dear friends.</p>
<p>The author Harper Lee faced these same challenges. She struggled for years in NYC working as an Eastern Airlines ticket agent. She had the talent and a literary agent, but she was forced to spend her energy trying to make ends meet, forgoing precious writing time. Then friends of hers gave her a year’s wages with the note: “You have one year off from your job to write whatever you please. Merry Christmas.” She quit the airline and devoted herself to writing. Within a year, she had the first draft of <em>To Kill A Mockingbird</em>.</p>
<p>I’m hoping you’ll continue the legacy of Harper Lee’s friends, and help give me the time I need to write this book, carrying its resonant message beyond radio, stage and podcast.</p>
<p><strong>The Opportunity</strong></p>
<p>My overhead is incredibly low, but the expenses still mount. My target goal is $16,000, which will cover my expenses through June 2013. Your tax-deductible contributions will cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Studio expenses: electric, heat, phone, Internet, office supplies</li>
<li>Travel expenses: monthly NYC meetings with agents</li>
<li>Technological expenses: upgrades/training for social media and marketing, critical to building my audience</li>
<li>Artist fees: necessary to meet other conventional living expenses</li>
</ul><p>There are many ways for you to participate: sponsor a paragraph, sponsor a page, sponsor a chapter, and, if you’re really excited, sponsor the book! The tax deductions are a plus; the perks, one of a kind.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>People are hungry for this story because audiences recognize both the desire and struggle to rediscover their creative voice, take risks, and create their own identity. The story more than entertains – it validates, encourages and inspires.</p>
<p>Two years ago, my creative enterprise I Will Be Good Productions raised more than $15,000 to bring the stage version of the story to NYC, Nantucket and Tampa. I am hopeful the book version of the story will generate the same donor enthusiasm!</p>
<p>Now, I’m not saying that like Harper Lee, I’ll win the Pulitzer Prize, but I am an excellent writer, with major momentum and a prominent literary agent (and theater agent) who believes in me. Please help me make the most of this terrific opportunity. Thank you.</p>
