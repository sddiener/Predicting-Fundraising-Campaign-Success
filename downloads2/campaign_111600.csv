<p>It's never been a better time to be an author, considering the easy access to ebooks and online bookshops. But many authors try self publishing, which might see them paying large sums of money to be published with little support. Or, to get their work out with virtually no outlay, they skip the editing process and publish work that wasn't quite ready.</p>
<p>I don't believe in asking authors to pay to publish their work. But I do believe that they deserve fair compensation, alongside help to get that work as good as it can be before it is released into the wild. </p>
<p>All authors will be considered by Rillington Press, whether it's their first or their ninety-first book. They will have as much support as they need throughout, access to experienced editors and designers at fair prices and, most importantly, a competitive royalty paid at regular intervals. </p>
<p>But - until we're selling a few books, there are a number of costs that will need to be met. And that's why you're reading this.</p>
<p>First year costs that need your support include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Freelance fees</strong>. Proofreading, typesetting, ebook creation and some covers will be done in-house. Copy editing and some graphic design will be outsourced to trusted contacts.</li>
<li>
<strong>ISBNs</strong>. Books need ISBNs and it is more cost effective to buy a batch upfront than to buy them individually. </li>
<li>
<strong>Printing of paperback books</strong>. The print-on-demand model can be used very effectively to keep costs down but early copies still need to be paid for before there is a steady cash flow. Additionally, if the books are to go into retail outlets (and that's a decision that will ultimately be made by each author), a traditional print run will be needed. </li>
<li>
<strong>Proof copies</strong>. Essential before allowing a print run to start.</li>
<li>
<strong>Author copies</strong>. Freebies to the author to keep, sell or give away as they choose. </li>
<li>
<strong>Promotion</strong>. Of course, a great deal of promotion happens on social media and that's free, but that's rarely enough to make a big and fast impact for a new title. Plus, Rillington Press itself needs to be marketed.</li>
<li>

</div></div>","It's never been a better time to be an author, considering the easy access to ebooks and online bookshops. But many authors try self publishing, which might see them paying large sums of money to be published with little support. Or, to get their work out with virtually no outlay, they skip the editing process and publish work that wasn't quite ready.
I don't believe in asking authors to pay to publish their work. But I do believe that they deserve fair compensation, alongside help to get that work as good as it can be before it is released into the wild. 
All authors will be considered by Rillington Press, whether it's their first or their ninety-first book. They will have as much support as they need throughout, access to experienced editors and designers at fair prices and, most importantly, a competitive royalty paid at regular intervals. 
But - until we're selling a few books, there are a number of costs that will need to be met. And that's why you're reading this.
First year costs that need your support include:


Freelance fees. Proofreading, typesetting, ebook creation and some covers will be done in-house. Copy editing and some graphic design will be outsourced to trusted contacts.

ISBNs. Books need ISBNs and it is more cost effective to buy a batch upfront than to buy them individually. 

Printing of paperback books. The print-on-demand model can be used very effectively to keep costs down but early copies still need to be paid for before there is a steady cash flow. Additionally, if the books are to go into retail outlets (and that's a decision that will ultimately be made by each author), a traditional print run will be needed. 

Proof copies. Essential before allowing a print run to start.

Author copies. Freebies to the author to keep, sell or give away as they choose. 

Promotion. Of course, a great deal of promotion happens on social media and that's free, but that's rarely enough to make a big and fast impact for a new title. Plus, Rillington Press itself needs to be marketed.

General overheads such as web hosting.

To get going, the first release from Rillington Press will be a new edition of The Lodger, written by Marie Adelaide Belloc Lowndes in 1913 - a fine example of an early thriller, based on Jack the Ripper's activities - with an original introduction to Mrs Belloc Lowndes and the times she lived in.
'But that's not by a new author!' you may say. No, it isn't. But as well as finding new authors, I want to share what I consider classics: books that aren't in any of the top-ten-lists-of-books-you-need-to-read.

<h3>American Psychos</h3>
<p>Serial killers fascinate and horrify at the same time, and the FBI estimates there are between 25 and 50 active serial killers at any given time in the USA. A terrifying thought, but all too real. This current campaign's ultimate purpose is to produce an anthology of original serial killer fiction by authors well-versed in horror, crime and thriller genres. Inspired by the most disturbingly violent and graphic crime thriller novels of our time, including Bret Easton Ellis's <i>American Psycho</i> and Shane Steven's <i>By Reason of Insanity</i>, our goal is to make <i>American Psychos</i> a brutal, suspenseful, nightmare-inducing hard ride into hell.</p>
<p>Contributors will make it possible for Red Room to offer top dollar for top quality tales. We will be reaching out to some of the most renowned writers and with your help we can make it happen. We also have an open submission period from June through October, and all writers are welcome to submit their stories. If we reach our goal, accepted authors from the open submission will receive an additional $50 bonus!  <a href=""http://www.redroompress.com/submission-guidelines/american-psychos/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">View the guidelines on the Red Room Press website.</a></p>
<p>Producing a top-notch anthology takes thousands of dollars and all funds will be used to pay the contributors, the designers, typesetter, and audiobook narrators.</p>
<p>The book will be available in trade-paperback format, ePub, and Mobi. An audiobook will also be produced if sufficient funds are raised. The book is slated for publication in early 2018.</p>
<p>Crowd-funding a book is akin to pre-ordering that book. However, we do hope you’ll take advantage of some of our other great perks and rewards. We’re really excited about <i>American Psychos</i>, and believe it is a unique idea whose time has come. We hope you’ll support its publication.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>

Serial killers fascinate and horrify at the same time, and the FBI estimates there are between 25 and 50 active serial killers at any given time in the USA. A terrifying thought, but all too real. This current campaign's ultimate purpose is to produce an anthology of original serial killer fiction by authors well-versed in horror, crime and thriller genres. Inspired by the most disturbingly violent and graphic crime thriller novels of our time, including Bret Easton Ellis's American Psycho and Shane Steven's By Reason of Insanity, our goal is to make American Psychos a brutal, suspenseful, nightmare-inducing hard ride into hell.
Contributors will make it possible for Red Room to offer top dollar for top quality tales. We will be reaching out to some of the most renowned writers and with your help we can make it happen. We also have an open submission period from June through October, and all writers are welcome to submit their stories. If we reach our goal, accepted authors from the open submission will receive an additional $50 bonus!  View the guidelines on the Red Room Press website.
Producing a top-notch anthology takes thousands of dollars and all funds will be used to pay the contributors, the designers, typesetter, and audiobook narrators.
The book will be available in trade-paperback format, ePub, and Mobi. An audiobook will also be produced if sufficient funds are raised. The book is slated for publication in early 2018.
Crowd-funding a book is akin to pre-ordering that book. However, we do hope you’ll take advantage of some of our other great perks and rewards. We’re really excited about American Psychos, and believe it is a unique idea whose time has come. We hope you’ll support its publication.
Who We Are
Red Room Press (an imprint of Comet Press) is an independent publisher of extreme horror fiction, thrillers and crime fiction.

Perks

Plus various anthologies that Red Room Press and Comet Press have produced in the past decade including:

PLUS:  The editor is sacrificing her highly treasured, personalized signed copy of Stephen King's Song of Susannah  for this project. The book was signed in person at Barnes and Noble in the mid 2000s in NYC. Now that is dedication!
 



Risks & Challenges
If we don't meet our goal, we still intend to go through with this project. However, it will be much more difficult to reach out to top writers and pay them top rates. In our ten years of publishing we have followed through with every anthology project.

<p>If you're ready to explore the magical world of pixies and discover the beauty of navigating emotions than I invite you to come play with Scarlet, Della and Molly pixie.</p>
<p><strong>My dream</strong>, is to help all the little pixies out there understand and handle big feelings and have emotional empowerment, is just as important to me as parenting my 6-year-old little girl, who is my co-founder and the inspiration for my business, Scarlett.</p>
<p>I have been reading parenting books for many years but am always left looking for a kinder and more connective way to teach my little girl. Like any other parent, I want to do the best for my child, and I realised that by helping Scarlett understand emotions, fear, and empathy now, I would help her as an adult. I started reading my stories to her and she loved them, so I thought it was time I share them.</p>
<p>I don’t have a writing background; I haven’t been working as a blogger or journalist, I’m ‘just’ a mum. My love of writing started when I was seven years old, when I used to write plays and then perform them at school. I loved that time in my childhood; I loved being creative.</p>
<p>However, when I was a little bit older, the word dyslexia came into my life and my writing stopped.  I was schooled in the eighties when ‘if you couldn’t learn it was your fault, not the outdated teaching style’.</p>
<p>Let me leap ahead to last year; I met this wonderful, spiritual teacher who told me that I needed to start writing again, and to write about the pixies I had created, linking their tales to my past hurts and things I had learned. </p>
<p>She told me to look out for butterflies and that when I see them then I will know I am on the right path. So the next day, ever so excited, I pulled up my chair and sat by my open patio doors, and I started to write. From out of nowhere a flurry of butterflies were flying towards me it was such a delicious sight. I knew after that magical experience that I had to write this book.</p>

The Apollo missions were an amazing achievement of ingenuity, passion, bravery and commitment to achieve the seemingly impossible dream of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to Earth.    It took years to plan and thousands of people to accomplish this task. As a result, on July 16th, 1969 the massive Saturn V rocket lifted off from NASA's Kennedy Space Center carrying three astronauts on their mission to the moon. In 2019, the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 project, looking back 50 years to 1969, we respect all the Men and Women at NASA and supporting sites around the world who were able to achieve this incredible feat without nowadays technology.To remind descendants, to arouse the passion of science, and the desire to reach out to the world are the main objectives of this campaign.In honor of this achievement we have set out to produce the highest quality reproduction:1/ The story of the Apollo projectWe will compose all of the milestones, details of the Apollo project to bring a story, a true documentary of human journey into the space.On July 20th, 1969 two American astronauts ( Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin ) became the first men to step on the moon. It was a dream and a challenge set forth by one man, President John F. Kennedy, when he declared in May of 1961 :   We will bring you the journey from the first brick to the final success of Apollo 11.Everything will be coming true and clear about the work of passion, blood, tears and enthusiasm of everyone in the project. All bursted when the final success of Apollo 11 came. A story of cooperation, morale, sacrifice for the common purpose of human beings. You will be immersed in the re-imagined space of the Apollo project. We want it to inspire you in your life since maybe you are the one who will take the humanity to discover this vast universe. 450 pages of books are edited and carefully selected, bringing you into the world of Apollo missions. 2/ The Story Of The Apollo Project For KidSpecial editions for children. The story of the Apollo project journey has been edited to be understood easily and friendly to children, encouraging curiosity and love for science, giving children the motivation to develop their passions.  Our specialists are very caring for this publication. We want to inspire our children, and make them cosmic citizens 3/ The Apollo 11 Mission Control  The Apollo 11 Final Flight Manual used by Mission Control, Flight Controllers, Astronauts and supporting personnels around the globe throughout the Apollo 11 mission. We set out one goal which is to recreate the Apollo 11 Final Flight Manual in the most accurate way. We start from the beginning to reproduce every single page, using accurate fonts, colors, spacing and papers, as well as re-draw all vector graphics based on very high resolution scans of the original Apollo 11 Final Flight Plan.All texts have been reproduced using the same font as the original Flight Manual. We are using the same line spacing and every letter appears in the exact same position on the page as the original Apollo 11 Flight Manual. It all strives to bring a true vision of what has happened, what the previous generation did and reminded us of responsibility for the future. 4/ The Apollo 11  Project Lunar Landing ChartThe Original 1967 NASA Apollo 11 Lunar Landing Chart Restored, Recolored, and Reissued. This reissue of The Apollo 11 Lunar Landing Chart will measure 1' x 3' ( 12"" x 36""/30cm x 92cm ). It will be printed on 80lb glossy cover stock with a UV coating and feature a 1/4"" border - in black - so it will be easy to frame. The title block will also feature foil stamping to really commemorate the occasion. This is a standard panorama frame size as well, so pre-made frames can easily be purchased.This chart is a wonderful paper souvenir of one of the most glorious events in humankind and yet very few people own it. So we hope to change your mind with this project.A fifty-year-old chart has been given new life.....it deserves this.  5/ Human Mission To Mars Mission to conquer Mars will start soon. This is the right time for us to celebrate the past and look forward to the future. Therefore, our team has composed the most valuable documents about the projects which brings us to Mars and their progress. With the most intuitive images and information, you will not regret having possession of this kit and using it to talk to your children. Maybe your kids will become the person bringing human out of the earth. THE STICKER SET FOR ALL BACKEROne 4"" circular sticker features the original artwork from the Apollo 11 mission patch. The astronauts wanted the image on the patch to be symbolic so they chose a bald eagle with its ""landing gear"" extended. The eagle is the proud symbol of the United States but it was also the name of the lunar module. To symbolize the peaceful nature of the mission, the eagle carries an olive branch - the symbol of peace. The Highest Quality DocumentAll tables and diagrams have been recreated using vector artwork, this allows us to infinitely scale and create the highest quality printed document. Everything will be reproduced in minute details including fold out charts as per the original documentsThe materials we compiled will be in great quality. Everything is made to be precise and detailed so that everyone has the best experience, inspired life and creativity. Each page document will be shipped in your choice of binder. We have a finished prototype artwork, a confirmed manufacturer for the binders as well as a printer who is able to produce the document to our exact specifications. Each page will also be printed on reinforced paper to eliminate stretching or tearing. We need your kindly help to fund an exclusive production run, so please get back us by today.  All NASA logos and works are owned by NASA. We maintain NASA as the source of the Campaign When I can receive my order?

<h2>Misconceptions</h2>
<p>Russia is not all cold. I come from the South, from the mountains. On the southern slopes they grow oranges and tea. You’ve heard about those places: Georgia, Abkhazia. At my place on the northern side of the range it’s a bit cooler, but it’s still the South, the Caucasus.</p>
<p>In 2002 I moved to Canada. That is another life; another dimension in the world of worlds. After violence and war Canada felt like rehabilitation, like a model paradise. Here I had to shed some misconceptions. For example, I saw a poster on the subway in Toronto about an exhibition of Iroquois art. I was surprised, because the Iroquois were the baddies, but the poster didn’t show that. And it clicked: my impression of the Iroquois came from Fenimore Cooper, whom I read when I was little. The Iroquois sided with the French in his novels, so that’s why they were villains, because they were on the other side of the fence in a book of fiction. And in any case by now that fence was gone; the glorious poster was the evidence. Just like that, in the blink of an eye, a whole chunk of knowledge was updated.</p>
<p>Many years later, after careful consideration, I realize I have something really unique to offer to the public. So here I am, on Indiegogo, hoping to raise funds from the public for the financing of my book. </p>
<p>Experiment in Literary Investigation – that’s the subtitle of Solzhenitsyn’s famous book “The Gulag Archipelago”. I borrow this subtitle for use in the same way: the compilation and analysis of personal and trustworthy observations. That turns out to be a genre. It must be conceptually close to the American genre of gonzo-journalism, where the author is a participant in the reported events, as in Hunter S. Thompson’s books. So I’m borrowing some things from these writers, as well as Bulgakov, Capote, Márquez, Salinger.</p>
<p>The book’s main themes are individual, culture and identity, in short. The following text introduces the author, expands on some of the themes and tries, all in all, to persuade you to support this campaign.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Author </h3>
<p>Educated in the field of linguistics, a programmer and a graphic designer by trade, I also make unpopular music and untimely art. (That’s not a value judgement, rather a statement of the results’ utter utilitarian uselessness). For me there is no precarious contradiction here – all those occupations have something in common: knowledge translation. For example, as a programmer I translate human needs for a machine and machine capabilities to the humans. A graphic designer, I translate my ideal (philosophically speaking) vision of the world into my work: identities, logotypes, websites – things that add to our sensory lives. Sensations I translate into art. This is what I really do under the surface of routines: I am a translator, converter of information.</p>
<p>Here are three reasons why supporting this book is objectively a good and useful action.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Historicity</h3>
<p>As far as my story goes, you’ve probably heard about my city, maybe on the news, in a segment about a war in Chechnya, or the Beslan hostage tragedy, or some of those 2,000+ terrorist attacks that were carried out in Russia since 1990 (says Wiki). Likely you’ve forgotten, as I would, and everybody does. That’s why eyewitness accounts are important. We have a better chance of not repeating our mistakes while we remember them.</p>
<p>Enough mistakes were made there under very catastrophic circumstances, in the environment that went from neutral to hostile. I am talking about the time of the disintegration of the Soviet State and the long spell of anarchy that followed. That time has left a scar across the largest country in the world. Previously such a wound that affected every person was WWII.</p>
<p>That wound, that post-Soviet anarchy that Putin switched off (why his popularity will not fall below the election minimum) has found some reflection in our human record. For example, in the Russian villains characters in the movies. Very little of that has to do with the periphery like the Caucasus, let alone a small distinct region there. </p>
<p>In academia it’s the reports from the various human rights organizations. I read their reports and use their stats (hats off!), but their interests and mine are in two different dimensions. They are interested in the processes at the satellite view level – nothing wrong with that – when my view is from ‘here is my breakfast’ level. </p>
<p>My material lends itself elegantly to literary expression, but I don’t think I can pull off fiction. So I decided to be honest, in the sense of trying to tell the truth to the best of my ability and to the extent of my courage. It is a quest both personal and documentary. And here is the rub: life in a city like mine in the Caucasus in the 90s is not well-documented. It means that there is a space for my book.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Fairness</h3>
<p>Caucasians are ancient tribes... Now wait a minute, what tribes? This kind of thing used to amuse me: a tall blonde Norseman called a Caucasian. In the West the white people are called “Caucasian” after that same Caucasus, out of a peculiar taste of J. F. Blumenbach for Georgian skulls. He was a founding anthropologist two hundred years ago. In Russian the word specifically refers to the individuals of the Caucasian ethnicities, they mostly look Middle Eastern or Mediterranean.</p>
<p>So, those are the Caucasians, ancient tribes, they were always there. They carried their cultures through centuries of living between two seas – in the path for armies, in the way of merchants – and are fiercely proud of it. Their sagas root all the way in the Neolithic. In the past. The past has been studied well-enough. Archaeology and myth comprise much of geographically relevant literature.</p>
<p>But how exactly did those cultures go through those same periods – socialism and anarchy? You may have heard about the traditional hospitality and generosity in the Caucasus. But what do you know about the Caucasian racism, sexism, violence, rapes?</p>
<p>Those evil facts of life, inescapable like the hot thick air before a thunderstorm, endless like a polar night with wolves outside – individual terror doesn’t get into stats. I heard the survivors back then, telling me their stories tête-à-tête – in corridors during long waits, smoking on the stairs, on the phone. People talked with me, and sometimes, after a conversation or two, shared their pains. I do not intend to betray their trust. But for the sake of their suffering they are owed a validation. They deserve their existence to be acknowledged. I think it has to be done, and I’m doing it in the book. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Utility</h3>
<p>It took me a decade to begin to understand the Canadian reality, see its dynamics, and feel it for my own. In those transitional years I saw many misconceptions and found some curious trends in how they were constructed and in which one of the three lives.</p>
<p>My three lives. High socialism. Anarcho-capitalism. Advanced democracy. Different planets with different priority of gravities, shon at by the same stars, at different angles. I use the extraordinary and systemic differences between those realities for analytical triangulation of sorts. Just like human eyes, modern telescopes can be used in pairs and clusters for more precise observation. That’s the way I use my three matrices in the book. If we examine a common phenomenon from two or more deep and rich points of view we add a dimension, a perspective to it, and see its true nature, its (possibly human) condition more precisely.</p>
<p>I use this method to examine, among other things, the shared problems, many of which I’ve seen in concentration. My Western life provides the reality into which I translate the realities of the past so you could really get it. Maybe we can prevent some things from happening, if we understand them better.</p>
<p>Maybe we can manage the known problems better if we know more about them. I hope that my observations may contribute to the public discourse on real, painful issues: drug addiction, alcoholism, bullying. If this book shifts something somewhere and helps one person rise above those evils – this whole project will not be in vain.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>I’m grateful for your consideration.</p>
<p>One more thing: I am afraid that my choice of examples may misrepresent the book as a comparative study in misery. That is not so. I am far enough removed from my own memories to examine them objectively. Good and the beauty are there. But I would rather stop giving out spoilers. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Money Talk</h2>
<p>I am finishing my pile of material, looking forward to editing: rewriting, structuring, styling. Then typesetting, layout, all that design and then release. If this campaign is not successful, none of that will happen in years, likely ever, because it hasn’t happened in years past. If the campaign succeeds I’ll just work on the book until it’s done. Unless who knows what. I heard somewhere that startups usually take twice the time and three times the money over what founders expect.</p>
<p>This is exactly what Indiegogo is for, isn’t it, to distribute the risk? Almost like a form of insurance for projects that promise a net benefit to the society. I estimate the risk of five  months, plus a small warchest/error-fund and various expenses at 20,000 CAD (~15k USD) and I can’t carry this risk alone. I’ll carry other risks: misjudging the required time, underestimating costs, risking all my future campaigns on this first try. But what I hope to get out of this campaign is captive audience, because maybe people who care enough to contribute might also be inclined to read this book, or pass it on to somebody who will.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>20,000 CAD = 21,739 CAD (≈16,722 USD)</h3>
<p>If this campaign succeeds the result will be an ebook. Every contribution is significant for our goal, every contributor will get an electronic version of the book.</p>
<p>The goal doesn’t include the 8% of Indiegogo’s and bank’s fees, so if we factor those in we get 21,739 CAD (≈ 16,722 USD).</p>
<p>In case I fail to raise the money, whatever I do raise will be used for some book-related purposes anyway, everything will depend on how much is lacking. </p>
<p>My material is ripening, like grapes. There will be a moment really soon when it will have to be harvested and processed. That’s why I’m here counting on your help.</p>
<p>The $21,739 is the optimal goal, the goal to shoot for. Please do what you can and support this campaign now.</p>

My material is ripening, like grapes. There will be a moment really soon when it will have to be harvested and processed. That’s why I’m here counting on your help.
The $21,739 is the optimal goal, the goal to shoot for. Please do what you can and support this campaign now.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>We are super excited to announce the publication of our second book!</strong></p>
<p>Sarah Awa’s book <i>Hunter’s Moon</i> is scheduled to be released on January 1st. However, pre-orders will be available starting December 25th. Pre-orders are a chance to get the book at a discount and to help the book come out of the publishing gate at a higher ranking on Amazon. </p>
<p>Here’s the back-cover summary of the book and a peek at the front cover:</p>
<p>After a wild animal attack, Melanie Caldwell ends up sick and disoriented. She and her friends think she’s suffering from infection and just needs to go to the doctor. Then she’s kidnapped on the day of the next full moon, and discovers in the worst way that monsters are real . . . and that she has become one of them.</p>
<p>All Melanie wanted was to get a boyfriend and graduate college. Now she has to somehow deal with agonizing monthly transformations, a secret organization stalking her, friends and enemies trying to discover her secret, and hunters looming on the horizon.</p>
<p>If only she knew whom to trust. . . .</p>
<p> </p>
<p align=""center""> </p>
<p>What We Need to Publish</p>
<p>Through our Indiegogo campaign, which will begin December 18th and end December 31st, we’ll be raising funds to print physical copies of the book. We’ve sourced our printing through the printers we have researched that offer us the best bang for the buck. But, even so, copies of books still add up. Each copy we print costs us about $5 for just the printing. We plan on ordering about 500 books for our first run of printing. That means each book costs an initial $2,500. </p>
<p>Risks &amp; Challenges</p>
<p>Sometimes I wonder why...why bother starting Thinklings Books or any company? It's such a hard endeavor! What'd we get ourselves into? We're small fish in a great big ocean. Heck, we're fish eggs right now. Caviar. … <i>Caviar.</i> High quality, costly, of great value. And trying to help other writers who are small but valuable too. That thought helps me just keep swimming.</p>
<p>Other Ways You Can Help</p>
<p>1. Book Reviews</p>
<p>Honest reviews are super hard to come by, especially for first-time authors, but are one of the best ways to boost sales.<br/><br/>I know, also, that people get extra nervous about writing reviews. I’m sure it has something to do with those awful page-long book reports we had to do in school, but this isn’t going to be graded and doesn’t need to be nearly as long. You don’t even have to summarize the book; that’s what the book’s summary is for. Did you like the book because you liked how the main character talked? Say that. If you thought it was really good, but you were hoping for a certain ending and that didn’t happen? Write that.<br/><br/>Honest, short, to-the-point. <br/><br/>2. Share Their Social Media Posts<br/><br/>It’s hard for many writers to continually post about themselves. Writers mostly tend to be a quiet, self-deprecating lot. With our Platform in a Box, we teach them some types of simple posts they can make about their books, but it’s even more helpful if you can share these posts.<br/><br/>No need to add anything to it if you don’t want to. A simple share to page, or retweet, is fine. If you want to go the extra mile, like the Thinklings Books page on Facebook and share our posts about the author.<br/><br/>3. Book Launch Party<br/><br/>​If you are really up for some party planning and have that pizzazz, then working with a local library, bookstore, or other venue to plan a fabulous book signing / launch party is a wonderful gift for the writer in your life. If you have terrific party-planning skills but don’t know anything about book launches, just send an email to contact@thinklingsbooks.com. I’ll be more than willing to help you brainstorm.<br/><br/>Authors can, of course, plan their own party; but it does seem more legit to bookstores if someone else does it . . . even if you are just the person of contact, fill out the permission forms, and then disappear into the night. <br/><br/>Even if you aren’t the planning or form-filling type, you can still make sure that you show up for the book signings or launch party. Having a friendly face in the crowd makes even the most boisterous, confident author feel more at ease.<br/><br/>4. Low-Tech Sharing<br/><br/>Even if you don’t like computers, social media, or the internet, you can still talk up the book on the physical streets. Your author can give you bookmarks, posters, or flyers to put in schools, libraries, bookstores, or community centers. You can even use mankind’s oldest (and arguably greatest) technology: the spoken word. Tell your book club. Tell your mother. Tell your friend who likes to read.<br/><br/>Here are a few additional low-tech options:</p>
<p>-Put the book in one of those little free library boxes. </p>
<p>-Leave the book on a table in a coffee shop.</p>
<p>-Gift the book to readers in your life.</p>
<p>-Give the book, if applicable, to local school libraries.</p>
<p>-Form your own book club and use your author’s book as the first book.</p>
<p>-Leave a flyer wherever you see people reading books.</p>
<p><br/>5. Putting Books on Consignment at Bookstores<br/><br/>The author can, again, put their book on consignment at a local bookstore, but it looks better if someone else does this. Most local bookstores have a form you can fill out, and you can give them a couple of copies of the book. You can ask your author, or email us at contact@thinklingsbooks.com, for wholesale copies of the book to give to bookstores.<br/><br/>When the bookstores sell the book, they keep a certain amount of the profit and will hand the rest over to you. Usually these consignment contracts have a specific amount of time that they will have your book available. If the book doesn’t sell all of its copies before the end, you will need to come back and pick them up.<br/><br/>This is an especially good strategy if you are having a book signing at the local bookstore. Most of the copies will be sold right around the time of the book signing. If your author is well known in the community, you may be able to negotiate for a really good placement for the book. But, even if she is not well known, many local bookstores do have a special place for local authors to be displayed, and often quite prominently. <br/><br/>If you need help negotiating this area, shoot Thinklings Books an email, and we’ll be happy to help you out. We’re here to make everyone’s job easier.<br/><br/>6. Requesting at Libraries<br/><br/>Did you know that you can request books to be at your local library? Some libraries will have the book available after just one request. Others require a few more. On the other hand, libraries also have e-books for borrowing as well. You can check out the author’s book on your Kindle or other e-reader device through the library’s online catalog. This is an easy way for the library to offer a wide array of books without actually buying them. If enough people check out the e-book from the library, they may even decide to have a hard copy available as well.<br/><br/>You can just walk right up to the librarian and ask if they have your author’s book available. You don’t even need to let them know the author is a friend. Just see if they have it available. They will look it up and say one of 3 things: 1) Yes, we have it available. 2) We do not have the hard copy of it, but you can download it via the online catalog. 3) We do not have it available, but you can submit a request; here’s the form or the link to the form. <br/><br/>Easy peasy. <br/><br/>7. Writing Reviews on Goodreads<br/><br/>In addition to leaving reviews on Amazon, you can also use Goodreads, which is a social media platform for readers. You just need to follow the same advice I gave above for Amazon. In fact, you can leave the same review you left on Amazon.<br/><br/>8. Leaving Comments on Their Blog<br/><br/>As part of Platform in a Box, authors are given a simple website with a blog. They will once, maybe twice per month, write a post on the blog about their book, give an update on it or themselves, or on something related to their craft.<br/><br/>Checking in once in a while and leaving a simple, authentic comment such as “Can’t wait to see you at the book festival!” is great. Asking the author a question is also great. For example, “Who is your favorite author?”<br/><br/>9. Join The Readers’ Collective<br/><br/>The Readers’ Collective is Thinklings Books’ group of diehard fans and readers. We send out weekly updates on our authors, which will include yours; YouTube videos; artwork; blogs; important links and dates; podcasts; and much more. It’s the easiest way to keep abreast of Thinklings’ offerings and what is going on in your author’s life. <br/><br/>Being part of the Collective comes with quite a few perks, such as discounts on books, exclusive author interviews and artwork from their books, and sneak peeks at videos and recordings of their books. You never know what goodies might show up in your inbox!<br/><br/>It’s easy to sign up. Just follow this link and put in your email address and you’ll be all set. Make sure you check your spam folder so it doesn’t get junked before you see it.<br/><br/>10. Get Involved with Crowdfunding<br/><br/>Thinklings Books does publishing a little differently. We’re a small press, and we use a structure similar to PBS or NPR. We pay our authors higher royalties, to boot. To borrow from PBS: Without the financial support of readers like you, Thinklings wouldn’t exist. If you want to learn more about how Thinklings operates and is different, we did a <a href=""https://www.thinklingsbooks.com/blog/how-thinklings-does-it-differently-diversifying-income#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">three-part</a> <a href=""https://www.thinklingsbooks.com/blog/cutting-costs#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">blog</a> <a href=""https://www.thinklingsbooks.com/blog/platform-in-a-box#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">series</a> on the topic.<br/><br/>In addition to this page, we also have <a href=""https://www.patreon.com/join/thinklingsbooks"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Patreon</a>, which will allow people to support our writers and our creative endeavors on a monthly basis. Patreon might be something many of you have never heard of before, but I think it is super awesome! It’s a website that puts a modern spin on the age-old idea of patronage. Most great artists of the past, from Leonardo da Vinci to Mozart, had patrons. Most of the time, these patrons were extremely wealthy families with money to burn. However, Patreon makes patronage accessible to even the average Joe. With monthly patronage subscriptions as low as $1 per month, even high school students have the ability to support artists of their choice. Like patrons of old, Patreon subscribers get special bonuses from the artists beyond the reach of the general public. We’ll be reading our first chapters on video, providing exclusive artwork related to the books, and giving control of picking video critiques to our Patreon subscribers. Plus a lot more!</p>

<h3>My name is Dave Bayford.</h3>
<p>I write under the name M.D. Dragon. I am owner and operator of Boaz Jachin Publishing. This campaign is to help get my company up and running in a proper and professional capacity. By donating to this you will help me reach this goal. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>This campaign will benificial to to both myself and the comunity I reside in.</h3>
<p>I am in need of $4000 to help me get the office space needed and to get the first book in print, both in e-book and softcover format. I am offering everyone who helps in this campaign a free e-book copy of the book and a 50% discount on the softcover at my book launch. The copy of the book if purchased will be autographed as well. There will be a limited number of books available in the first printing, only 200 will be printed, so this makes the first print autographed that much more special. Any funds raised if I don't reach my goal within the 60 days will be going towards printing costs and or office space leasing depending on the amount that does get raised. </p>

<h3>Your contribution will help me to get this company into the professional light and to help me leave behind something for my family.</h3>
<p>In doing this I am also hoping that I can give back to the community that I have called home for the past 26 years. I have over the past 20 years been involved in youth organizations such as Youth Bowling Counsel, Umpire for Pee Wee League, former Vice-President Navy League for Triumph Sea Cadets, Chair school counsel and head of the nutrition program at Memorial city school. All of which are located in the Crown Point community in Hamilton Ontario.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>All fundraisers come with trials and tribulations.</h3>
<p>Using the money will help to establish the company in a very competitive market. Most publishing companies prefer to stick within specific genres. This company will be open to all genres. This gives all authors a chance to be published under one label instead of trying to find a publisher that only deals in the genre that they write in. It also helps them to find a company that is not a vanity label. This means that my company will not be focused only on our output every year but on the quality of writing by the authors that sign with us.</p>
<h3>Every little bit helps.</h3>
<p>Even if you are unable to help monetarily at this time, spreading the word about this campaign helps as well. Spread the word to all your friends and family and anyone else who would be interested in helping me in seeing my goal of establishing myself in this market and being a welcoming company to new Canadian authors. This doesn't just affect me but others in this industry as well.</p>

The fact is that their is nothing much to put into a video that I cannot tell you here without revealing my true identity.</p><p>To get a free copy of chapter one from The Devil's Son, then <a href=""https://www.scribd.com/doc/268326136/Sample-Chapter-The-Devil-s-Son"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">click here</a><a href=""https://www.scribd.com/doc/268326136/Sample-Chapter-The-Devil-s-Son"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>.</p><h3><b>Short Summary</b></h3>
<p>Having
spent the first decade of my life being physically assaulted and the last eight
years being mentally manipulated into believing it was acceptable to be
punched, kicked and beaten for little or no reason I have chosen to speak
out. My physical abuse is now over but the scars are still there and I
live with one former abuser who still mentally tortures me!</p>
<p>My
campaign is here to change it! I want to make enough money to leave my home and
pursue the dreams and ambitions that I couldn't under their imprisonment. I
want people to know my story in order to understand what the effects of being
abused are. It is not all sad. A big part of the book is about the things
that helped me survive it all. It highlights the rare and amazing opportunities
I got to do while living in France and Romania. I’m selling the story so far to
make sure I can go further!</p>
<p>I have
lived through heaven and hell and all I want to do is move on. With your help
that is what I can do. I can launch my story to the world through this book and
help more people who are suffering abuse. I also need this money to move away
from the house I share with my spoiled; overly loved sister and former abusing
mother, who has worked to destroy my every shr</p><p>ed of success as detailed in the
book. You're changing my life for the better!</p>
<h3><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></h3>
<p></p><p>I need to
make at least $5,000 to leave my current home and set myself up in a different
place. It’s the bare minimum that I will need to start something new.</p>
<p>Two thirds of the income will go towards printing and delivering the book. An investment in a new cover for the book is being planned. The cost of a good artist rendition for the book cover will be roughly $1,000. This should bring the book to a standard suitable for publishing via mainstream routes in both printed and ebook formats. </p><p>Below is a donut chart outlining where the money you are giving to this campaign is going.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433684209/ymug433fmd9iwsnl1hvh.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>As you can see a large amount of the money is being spent on printing new books. These books are the ones being ordered on indiegogo. Any spare books will be sold offline or to our indiegogo InDemand contributors. An investment in the book cover will take a fifth of the income. The remaining income that is not take in Indiegogo and transaction fees will go towards my plans to leave my current home life and live somewhere free from the torment I am currently forced to live with.</p><p></p> <div> <h3>
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The Impact</span><br/>
</h3> <p>This campaign has two main impacts, one personal and one that is of a wider influence. You will be helping me to raise enough money to leave what is currently a miserable place to live.

The fact is that their is nothing much to put into a video that I cannot tell you here without revealing my true identity.To get a free copy of chapter one from The Devil's Son, then click here.Short Summary
Having
spent the first decade of my life being physically assaulted and the last eight
years being mentally manipulated into believing it was acceptable to be
punched, kicked and beaten for little or no reason I have chosen to speak
out. My physical abuse is now over but the scars are still there and I
live with one former abuser who still mentally tortures me!
My
campaign is here to change it! I want to make enough money to leave my home and
pursue the dreams and ambitions that I couldn't under their imprisonment. I
want people to know my story in order to understand what the effects of being
abused are. It is not all sad. A big part of the book is about the things
that helped me survive it all. It highlights the rare and amazing opportunities
I got to do while living in France and Romania. I’m selling the story so far to
make sure I can go further!
I have
lived through heaven and hell and all I want to do is move on. With your help
that is what I can do. I can launch my story to the world through this book and
help more people who are suffering abuse. I also need this money to move away
from the house I share with my spoiled; overly loved sister and former abusing
mother, who has worked to destroy my every shred of success as detailed in the
book. You're changing my life for the better!
What We Need & What You Get
I need to
make at least $5,000 to leave my current home and set myself up in a different
place. It’s the bare minimum that I will need to start something new.
Two thirds of the income will go towards printing and delivering the book. An investment in a new cover for the book is being planned. The cost of a good artist rendition for the book cover will be roughly $1,000. This should bring the book to a standard suitable for publishing via mainstream routes in both printed and ebook formats. Below is a donut chart outlining where the money you are giving to this campaign is going.As you can see a large amount of the money is being spent on printing new books. These books are the ones being ordered on indiegogo. Any spare books will be sold offline or to our indiegogo InDemand contributors. An investment in the book cover will take a fifth of the income. The remaining income that is not take in Indiegogo and transaction fees will go towards my plans to leave my current home life and live somewhere free from the torment I am currently forced to live with.  
The Impact
 This campaign has two main impacts, one personal and one that is of a wider influence. You will be helping me to raise enough money to leave what is currently a miserable place to live. You will also be contributing to a larger change in peoples understanding of abuse. The book will give you all an insight into what it is like to have lived my life and why it is important to address abuse in society. You will helping people currently living with abuse, former victims of abuse and will also give the abusers an insight into the effects of their actions on their victims.
I have lived every moment depicted in this book. I know what it is like to be the recipient of constant physical and psychological abuse by the people trusted to protect me the most in this world. I want to let the world know what it is like to live in a destructive world with no one to trust and nothing but hope to keep you going.
    Risks & Challenges The obstacles I have before me are the deadlines I have set for completion of the book for release. I have set some short deadlines for publishing but they are very much achievable and given the current writing pace the book should be complete by the end of June. 

The
artist would be hired at the end of the campaign and work on a short timeframe
to complete the cover. Printing
times will take two weeks before we can begin sending them out for national and international delivery. It is a tight set of deadlines but achievable and would allow prompt publication of the book.

<p>The illustration, design, and writing of <i>A Basket Full of Kittens </i>is complete. All that's left is to format the book for print and pay for a number of expenses. The first edition should take about 9 weeks to process and print once the order is in. </p>
<p>We are using the ""fixed funding"" option. That just means that if we don't reach our goal, you'll get your money back. But you won't get a book. Or a signed note from Mufasa. And the book won't get printed. :( That would be very sad, so let's make sure that doesn't happen, OK?</p>

You might have them. They may belong to relatives or close friends or co-workers. Consider giving them this politically neutral book, which will be easy to ready for even a very young reader.

Have you heard the joke about politicians wearing the logos of their sponsors like Nascar drivers? Well, we are making that a law in California! 
The California is Not For Sale initiative will require politicians to wear the logos of their top ten corporate donors anytime they present a bill on the assembly floor. 
We need YOUR help to make this happen! We need to collect 365,000 signatures by April 26th to make it on the ballot and we only have 150,000 so far. 
All funds raised will be used for paid signature gatherers and to help raise awareness around this cause.

I am trying to get out of self-publishing and into the traditional form. That is what this campaign is all about.  I am trying to raise money for the next step of this awesome journey! 
What I Need & What You Get
 In order to accomplish this dream, I need a total of $6,500. 
This is where the money will go:

Editing:  $1,400
I have sent my manuscript to a very reputable editing agency who
is interested in my story.  Included in this price they quoted is the cost of a

What Could This Impact?
My books may be science fiction, but they are so much more than just that. I've written the characters in such a way where you can relate to them in some way or another. I want to be an encouragement to other writers and show them that dreams really can come true. I know that sounds cliche, but with determination, perseverance, and a dash of courage anything is possible. 


    
What's The Risk?

As with any new adventure, there are always going to be some sort of risks involved. In this case, there are two.



Not all the money could be raised
There could be unexpected expenses



As for the first case, if I am not able to raise the amount I had hoped for, I won't give up. Instead, I'll start another campaign, at least I will have learned something from this one. For the second case, I may be fortunate enough to get all the money, however an expense could come up that wasn't expected. Providing the expense isn't too much, I would have to pay out of pocket. If it is too much, then I would need to do another fundraiser and would then have to put a stop in the publishing process. 

 
How Can You Help? 

If you are not able to give at this time the best way you can help me is by spreading the news! Word of mouth is the best way to get the news out there! Tell your friends, tweet it or post it on Facebook.  

If I go over my monetary goal, that is great! There are always unforeseen circumstances that could arise that the extra funds can go to. Plus, it can be used towards anything needed for publishing the remaining 7 books of the series!

<h3><strong>Why Arcoiris</strong></h3>
<p>As a communicator, i meet people in many different situations, and when we have to deal with little children the recurrent question is what i have do to get them quiet? There are no a single answer but what always works to me is take children seriously through fun games and activities. Thinking about that, Arcoiris was organized as a small collection of children's books to coloring, create new designs and learn easily.</p>
<p>Content of those book are guided by preschool stimulation rules, so kids and girls can better take advantage of them. Each activity have short instructions to daddies take part or guide children through the work.</p>
<p>Now comes the other side of the decision to be guided by preschool stimulation rules: distribute part of the print edition among children from low-income families. Preschool education provides children with the tools and basic concepts to face new learning in the future. However, preschool centers in Peru are often private and the material is expensive.</p>
<p>Arcoiris is not only a collection of books for children, but also a solidarity project that gives children in poverty the opportunity to obtain basic tools for their development.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What we need</h3>
<p>The collection is almost ready, my partners in this adventure and I are working on the design and drawings before printing. Now is when we need your help to take the books to the printing press, the packaging and finally the distribution.<br/>If we get more than we have planned, we can go faster with the distribution of books in communities within the country.</p>
<h3>The proposal </h3>
</div><div>
<p>The two books are intended to stimulate communication skills, graphomotor skills and motor coordination in children, as well as to develop concentration and memory.<br/>With that objective, mandalas, puzzles and identification games have been developed, which can be developed according to the creative perception of each child.</p>
<p>Our editorial proposal includes exercises that help children to express in a healthy way the stress and frustration that can be generated by the acquisition of new abilities. Thus, the little ones will learn to take control of their emotions.</p>
<p>Each book stimulates a group of skills: ABC is oriented to communication, graphomotor skills and motor coordination, while Mandalas reinforces concentration and memory, and at the same time introduces children to basic mathematics. This, however, does not prevent both books from finding points of mutual encounter and review.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>The restless temperament of children and their great capacity for distraction contrasts dramatically with the stillness and tranquility of the pages of a book. Therefore, one of the main challenges in developing these books was to achieve a balance between homework and play, so that children stay entertained and learning is fun.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Ways to help</h3>
<p>There are many ways to help us complete the launch of this mini-collection: supporting solidarity, buying the books in advance or promoting the campaign through friends and acquaintances who might be interested.</p>
<p>So that others know about this campaign do not forget to share it by clicking on the icons of social networks, choose yours and help us promote this beautiful adventure.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Alicia Fleming-Dorsey. I am a wife of 29 yrs., a mother of one child, 2 grandsons, an educator and an activist. I have two college degrees in business and love being an important part of children realizing their potential and soaring to higher heights. Rather a child is in a wheelchair, confronting cancer or playing in a playground, he or she can bring out the superhero in themselves without changing even one thing about how they look. There is no need to wear a cape or mask to be extraordinary, as fun as that can be too.</p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
</div><div>
<p>I need to raise $75,000, in order to complete my book. The illustrations have already been created. Now, I need to have the technology added to the book and then have it manufactured, here in the United States and marketed.</p>
<p>There are exciting perks offered for different amounts of money that you donate, like getting a shout out on my website so everyone knows that you just contributed to the completion of the book. Bigger donations will get you 1 or more free autographed books. You can also receive them hand delivered, by me. There are perks for larger donations too, like you and I having a meet and greet, for up to 2 hrs., when I hand deliver your signed copies of the book to you. I am also available to do events, for children, at no additional cost for people who donate $10,000.</p>
<p>If I do not meet my campaign goal of $75,000, all donations will go back to the donors and children will not get this incredible book that is about them. So please donate what you can.</p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>Your help is valuable in helping to make sure that children know they never have to change anything about themselves, in order, to be awesome and do extraordinary things. It really does take a village to raise a child. You being a part of the village with me assures children that we support their individualism and that difference never means that they cannot accomplish something they set their minds on to accomplish. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Starting any endeavor has its risks and challenges. Two that I might be faced with are getting the American company that I have right now, who is on standby, to continue to offer me the lowest pricing per quantity of books that are made. My Plan B is to have the books created by my backup manufacturers, if the price increases for the number of books I need to have created.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please donate what you can. No amount is too little. It all adds up and will make a huge difference in getting this book completed and into the hands of every child who thinks that he or she is limited by what he or she can do because they look different.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hey everyone, my name is Aaron Calimeri. Ded Ninja is my first novella and my first crowd-funded campaign. </p>
<p>Ded Ninja is a novella that reads like a straight-to-DVD action movie. Jon Ded is just an average guy trying to get by in a world of corruption. He does what he needs to do to survive, which usually means violence. He works as a bounty hunter for a local cartel, but he's no super vigilante and things often go haywire. This is the story of his worst failure yet, and how he gets himself out of major trouble when caught between two rival gangs.</p>
<p>Short version: Jon Ded is an idiot who shoots people, gets in car chases, and sucker punches you in the face.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need money to pay for my cover art, as well as printing and shipping.</p>
<p>What you get is an action packed novella that doesn't pull punches and will keep you entertained the entire way.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I need you guys to make this dream a reality. If successful, I will not only deliver a great product, but I will be able to create a sequel continuing the adventures of Jon Ded in a brand new setting!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>It's always a risk backing a new creator, and I have never written a novella before. </p>

<p>Homeland</p>
<p>Jacob has recently come home from his time in Afghanistan. After two bullets to the chest and shrapnel from an IED, Jacob is holding onto scars both physical and mental. Adjusting to home is has proven to difficult as he can’t seem to let go of the past. Memories of his time in combat haunt his dreams and plagues to wakefulness. He is a soldier that’s unable to move on.</p>
<p>Even though he goes to see his counselor, it hasn’t helped him see through the noise and horror that constantly bombards him. Too many days of living with his guilt of not being able to save friends in combat while he survived has torn him apart. He is a broken man and one without hope. He turns to the one thing he knows. Violence. As the PTSD escalates, he turns to the gun in his nightstand. One-shot, one kill, will the pain end forever, or will he live on to see another day.</p>
<p>I'm Matthew Angelo, a writer and a veteran of the US Armed Forces. The campaign for this novella is important as I want to highlight the realities of what many veterans with PTSD go through daily. There time in combat leaves many scared both mentally and physically and I feel it's essential that others know how deep these scars can run. </p>
<p>As a contributor, you'll help me get this book started. Even though it's a work of fiction, your contribution will help many open their eyes on what it means to truly support a combat veteran. My ultimate achievement is to see this story come to life and published for all to read.</p>

<p>Here's why I'm pursuing funding for this fiction novella:</p>
<ul>
<li>The book takes time for me to write. This means holding off on some of my work. This negligible amount of cash flow will help greatly.</li>
<li>The perks are where you get the fun stuff. I'll have three for major contributors: These include a ""thank you"" in the acknowledgment section, a copy of the ebook, and the biggest perk, a signed copy of the paperback as soon as its released.</li>

<p>Your Impact</p>
<p>As a contributor, you'll see the book come to life and a soldier fight for his life as he faces the day-to-day challenges of PTSD. The veteran suicide rate is 2-a-day. This is a large number and many need to see the reality. Many veterans are homeless and others cannot make their doctor's appointments at the VA. I want this story to reflect what happens in one soldier's life. That way, you can see how important it is to take care of our troops when they come home.</p>
<p>Risks and Challenges</p>
<p>Initially, I would like to seek publication with a small press. Unfortunately, the nature of the story, though fiction, may not sit well with them. If that fails, I'll self-publish, but then come the challenges of marketing and getting the book out there. </p>

<p>Hi, my name is Shawna Reppert, and I’m the award-winning author of the Ravensblood series of dark urban fantasy books. The series is set in an alternate-universe version of the Pacific Northwest, mostly Portland and surrounding areas. In the first book, my protagonist, a dark mage seeking redemption, struggles against impossible choices where sometimes death magic is the <i>lesser </i>of the evils. The first book in the series came out in October of 2013, and almost immediately people were begging me to make it available in audiobook.</p>
<p>Audio is not only a convenient and pleasant way to enjoy a book while driving or completing other tasks. For people with visual impairments, it may be the <i>only </i>way to enjoy a book.</p>
<p>That’s where you come in. If you are an audiobook fan, you are aware of how very important it is to have the right narrator. I was lucky enough to meet the incredibly talented narrator Matt Haynes at a science fiction and fantasy convention where we were both panelists. Matt is an Audible Approved Narrator and Producer and has many, many 5-star audiobooks available through Audible. I am positive that he will do justice to this award-winning novel. You don't need to take my word for it, though. Listen to him <a href=""http://youtu.be/EaEm6pYorms"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">read a teaser.</a></p>
<p>I’m asking you to chip in to get the ball rolling with the first book in the series. Any funds raised over and above the production costs for the first book will go to releasing other of my books in audiobook format. I have lots of exciting rewards available to contributors, including free audiobook downloads, Ravenscroft perfume and toiletries, original-cover books for collectors, and so much more! Thank you for your help in making this dream a reality, not only for me but for everyone waiting to hear this book in audio.</p>

</div><p> </p></div>","Hi, my name is Shawna Reppert, and I’m the award-winning author of the Ravensblood series of dark urban fantasy books. The series is set in an alternate-universe version of the Pacific Northwest, mostly Portland and surrounding areas. In the first book, my protagonist, a dark mage seeking redemption, struggles against impossible choices where sometimes death magic is the lesser of the evils. The first book in the series came out in October of 2013, and almost immediately people were begging me to make it available in audiobook.
Audio is not only a convenient and pleasant way to enjoy a book while driving or completing other tasks. For people with visual impairments, it may be the only way to enjoy a book.
That’s where you come in. If you are an audiobook fan, you are aware of how very important it is to have the right narrator. I was lucky enough to meet the incredibly talented narrator Matt Haynes at a science fiction and fantasy convention where we were both panelists. Matt is an Audible Approved Narrator and Producer and has many, many 5-star audiobooks available through Audible. I am positive that he will do justice to this award-winning novel. You don't need to take my word for it, though. Listen to him read a teaser.
I’m asking you to chip in to get the ball rolling with the first book in the series. Any funds raised over and above the production costs for the first book will go to releasing other of my books in audiobook format. I have lots of exciting rewards available to contributors, including free audiobook downloads, Ravenscroft perfume and toiletries, original-cover books for collectors, and so much more! Thank you for your help in making this dream a reality, not only for me but for everyone waiting to hear this book in audio.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

It is about resilience and determination; disability and how I never let mine stop me. It’s about the sport I fell in love with and how your dream can come true if you only keep chipping away at it. It’s the story of how, despite my early years’ experience, I became the first African Paralympian to qualify as a rower in Tokyo 2020. [Please see updates for the latest on Tokyo 2020.)</strong></p><p>At 9 months of age, I contracted Polio. It left the muscle on my left leg completely wasted and my right arm slightly weaker than the other. Callipers, wheelchairs and clutches became a part of everyday life as I was unable to walk unaided.</p><p>For a young person growing up with a disability future prospects can seem limited, yet I was not one to give up. I found new and unique ways to get involved in different sports, such as water-skiing, wheelchair basketball and football as the goalkeeper for my team. Still, nothing could have prepared me for the day I would become a qualifier for the 2020 Tokyo Paralympics. This was something I could have never envisioned as a child, as I was the least likely of my siblings to become an athlete.</p><p>And yet it seems I was destined for the journey. The first time I got into a boat was one of the most exhilarating experiences I’d ever had. I felt like I had walked on water and got such a sense of freedom that I knew it was where I belonged. Had I not attended a dinner party where one of the guests suggested that I should try rowing, or had I let being the only black or disabled member at the club dissuade me, I might have never discovered the sport I have grown to love. In fact, my consistent attendance at the club eventually opened up new adaptive rowing opportunities for around 15 disabled people, which is brilliant since people with disabilities have low levels of participation when it comes to the sport.</p><h3> </h3><h3><strong>Why I am writing this book and who it is for</strong></h3><p>Becoming a 2020 Paralympic Rower has been a journey, one that has involved embracing my disability, seizing opportunities and never giving up. Rowing is a sport of endurance, a sport where you have to get up close and personal with pain, doubt, discouragement and fear. It is not for the faint-hearted and demands all you’ve got and some. But if you think that’s tough, welcome to the world of para-rowing where, like me, you have to find ways to compensate for the lack of muscle tone other rowers take for granted.</p><p>I want to share the motivational story of this journey, how I didn’t let my disability stop me from striving to be the best version of myself as I took on the challenge of this gruelling sport. I want to share the lessons I’ve learned, and how you can use them to keep going in your own life to win at what you may even imagine to be farfetched goals.</p><p>You’ll love this book if you enjoy real-life stories about people who have overcome tough odds stacked against them. You will appreciate it if you prize stories that can keep you motivated even when you feel tired, that life has dealt you a dud set of cards or like the underdog.</p><p>My book will place you centre stage to my journey, so you can see that disability, adversity and setbacks need not prevent you from reaching your potential. Your race to victory need not involve disability or qualifying for the Paralympics as it’s been for me. The lessons I’ve learned are applicable to any area of life where the challenges ahead seem insurmountable. When you read this book I want you to feel like you’ve already won simply because you’re still in the ring.</p><h3> </h3><h3><strong>The Book – Paralympian Journey to Tokyo</strong></h3><p><strong>Paralympian Journey to Tokyo </strong><i>(working title) </i>is divided into 12 life-defining lessons, each sharing a crucial aspect of my journey as I, Kingsley Ijomah, grew from a baby whose parents had been told he would never walk, to a man who has learned to embrace his disability and is competing in the upcoming Paralympics.</p><p><i>This is a book about determination; one that will challenge the perspective of anybody that doubts themselves. It is the story of a young boy who would not let his disability define him. This book will show you what it takes to go from fighting your disability to embracing it, learning from it and excelling with it. </i></p><p>Within these lessons are crucial life principles that will take anybody beyond their current mindset and help them to see that the possibilities for their own journey are endless.</p><p>My hope is that you will be inspired by the stories, lessons and principles shared in this book and motivated to begin, continue or resume your own journey of perseverance, going after whatever you believe in and knowing that you can reach your dreams if you persist.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Read this book to discover…</strong></p><ul>

<h3>Rolling Around the World</h3>
<p>If Morton's List has ever touched your life, ended your boredom, or given you cherished memories or scars, we call on you now to share in a momentous gift. A global Quest is underway . . . to fulfill the greatest wish of the Morton's List A Trip to Someplace Fresh contest winner, Matt Foy of Muncie, Indiana. Matt was chosen purely by chance to receive this life-changing benefit. His dream destination? The ruins of ancient Sumeria in present-day Iraq - land of the first cities, the first writing, the cradle of civilization itself. Join us in funding this most magnificent Quest yet undertaken. Together we will send Matt to Iraq and make the most implausible adventure an undeniable reality.<br/><br/>Ninja Nate Andren<br/>R. Jesse Deneaux<br/>Morton’s List co-authors<br/>A Trip to Someplace Fresh Contest organizers<br/> </p>
<h3>How We Arrived Here</h3>
<p>Atop a Mayan pyramid in the ruins of Tikal, Guatemala at daybreak on December 21, 2012, there began a new type of Morton’s List Quest. Those present were given the Twilight Scroll-level mission to Find Atlantis. Four years later, equipped with the necessary skills and SCUBA gear, the Morton’s List team headed to dive the Bimini Road in the Bahamas for firsthand research. Rolling on the cyclopean underwater blocks they once again consulted Morton’s List for guidance, receiving the Quest of Wish Fulfilled.<br/><br/>Tasked with fulfilling someone’s greatest wish in life, and seeking the next Quest destination, trip organizers and Morton’s List co-authors Ninja Nate Andren and R. Jesse Deneaux launched the A Trip to Someplace Fresh contest. Entrants simply submitted the one place on earth they most wanted to visit, and why. The randomly-rolled winner is Matt Foy and his dream is to connect with the ruins of ancient Sumeria, now in modern-day Iraq. This also happens to be the most distant, unstable, and logistically challenging of all submitted destinations, which is especially fitting for this inaugural event.<br/><br/>With the help of everyone who's ever been entertained by and benefited from the Quests of Morton’s List, as well as everyone you know, we will fund Matt's trip of a lifetime. Join R. Jesse and Ninja Nate in this pioneering crowdfunder for the grandest Morton's List Quest yet.

</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Every aspect of this expedition has been thoroughly researched and planned, with the guidance of experienced local tour operators. $9k will fund all crowdfunder rewards and 7 days of all-inclusive travel throughout Iraq. Matt’s touchdown in Baghdad is currently scheduled for Monday, March 8th, 2021 with flexibility to adjust to any international travel restrictions. If the Global Inner Circle cannot raise $9k, we will continue to make every effort to get Matt to Sumeria. We would then ask backers not to request refunds, and instead to forgo medallions, using their high production cost to instead cover trip expenses. If further project cost reduction is required, the book could be released solely as an eBook. Without the expense of these rewards, the total travel cost is about $5.5k. If we cannot raise even that amount, we will automatically refund all donations and move on to other projects.<br/><br/>We acknowledge that safety is most people's primary concern, and that the US State Department advises the average US citizen against traveling to Iraq. Matt and those organizing this expedition are experienced and resourceful international travelers, ready to adapt to changing situations on the ground. Itineraries and travel plans remain flexible to account for the global pandemic, and shifting geopolitical realities. Of all the destinations that could have been randomly rolled, Sumeria was chosen by the Morton Boulder. It is now our challenge to make this unlikely destiny real. Give now at the highest level you can, as we grant A Trip to Someplace Fresh through the limitless Karma of the Inner Circle.<br/> </p>

If Morton's List has ever touched your life, ended your boredom, or given you cherished memories or scars, we call on you now to share in a momentous gift. A global Quest is underway . . . to fulfill the greatest wish of the Morton's List A Trip to Someplace Fresh contest winner, Matt Foy of Muncie, Indiana. Matt was chosen purely by chance to receive this life-changing benefit. His dream destination? The ruins of ancient Sumeria in present-day Iraq - land of the first cities, the first writing, the cradle of civilization itself. Join us in funding this most magnificent Quest yet undertaken. Together we will send Matt to Iraq and make the most implausible adventure an undeniable reality.Ninja Nate AndrenR. Jesse DeneauxMorton’s List co-authorsA Trip to Someplace Fresh Contest organizers 
How We Arrived Here
Atop a Mayan pyramid in the ruins of Tikal, Guatemala at daybreak on December 21, 2012, there began a new type of Morton’s List Quest. Those present were given the Twilight Scroll-level mission to Find Atlantis. Four years later, equipped with the necessary skills and SCUBA gear, the Morton’s List team headed to dive the Bimini Road in the Bahamas for firsthand research. Rolling on the cyclopean underwater blocks they once again consulted Morton’s List for guidance, receiving the Quest of Wish Fulfilled.Tasked with fulfilling someone’s greatest wish in life, and seeking the next Quest destination, trip organizers and Morton’s List co-authors Ninja Nate Andren and R. Jesse Deneaux launched the A Trip to Someplace Fresh contest. Entrants simply submitted the one place on earth they most wanted to visit, and why. The randomly-rolled winner is Matt Foy and his dream is to connect with the ruins of ancient Sumeria, now in modern-day Iraq. This also happens to be the most distant, unstable, and logistically challenging of all submitted destinations, which is especially fitting for this inaugural event.With the help of everyone who's ever been entertained by and benefited from the Quests of Morton’s List, as well as everyone you know, we will fund Matt's trip of a lifetime. Join R. Jesse and Ninja Nate in this pioneering crowdfunder for the grandest Morton's List Quest yet. Every penny of the $9k goal goes directly to funding Matt's flights, ground transportation, guides, security, guides, accommodation, delicious meals, and archaeological site entrance fees, as well as production costs for the book, medallion, and other Perks. Organizers have donated hundreds of hours of their time over several years to make this possible, and are happy to receive zero compensation. Fulfilling Matt's wish - with your help - is our singular mission.

Коли
читачі стають співавторами
Привіт,
дорогий друже!
Ми
Олександр, Олександра, Олександра, та Лада, автори,
перекладачі та редактори науково-фантастичної новели“Монстр: Лезо Темряви”. В
той час, як Олександр родом з Молдови (хоч і має трохи української крові), всі
інші народились в Україні.
З самого
початку мрія про новелу “Монстр:
Лезо Темряви” стала
реальністю завдяки спільній підтримці багатьох неймовірних та добрих людей з
різних країн.  Вперше вона
була написана Олександром та випущена у серпні 2014 року в Молдові завдяки
фінансовій підтримці читачів, через кампанію зі збору коштів в Інтернеті. Новела
була перекладена англійською надзвичайним читачем зі Швеції, Erika Rydergard, а
англійська версія опублікована Wolfgang Stricker з
Австрії видавництвом “serendii”. Ілюстрації до книжки
були створені художниками Kärt Viljalo з Естонії та Catherine Starostenko
з України.Долучившись
до спільноти читачів та прихильників “Монстр:
Лезо Темряви”, ми,
Олександра, Олександра та Лада, вирішили перекласти та опублікувати милозвучною
мовою нашої країни, українською. Отже, ми об’єднали зусилля з Олександром та
почали готувати українську версію новели.
На
сьогоднішній момент, ми закінчили переклад “Монстр: Лезо Темряви” та готуємо книжку до публікації та
розповсюдження серед української аудиторії, серед тих, хто з нетерпінням чекає
отримати та прочитати її! Ми просимо ТВОЄЇ підтримки, друже.
Якщо ТИ
хотів би
+ Допомогти нашій справі та розповсюдити новелу українською мовою;
+
Надати можливість українським читачам зрозуміти та обдумати теперішні та
майбутні відносини Людини та Природи рідною мовою;
+
Фігурувати у всіх українських публікаціях “Монстр:
Лезо Темряви” як
помічник у втіленні мрії;
+
Отримати ексклюзивне перше видання новели українською з персональним підписом
від автора;
То
ми запрошуємо тебе вибрати додаткові бонуси які хочеш отримати та допомогти “Монстр:
Лезо Темряви” бути
доступною для українців та, звісно, для тебе!
Новела Людьми для Людей
“Монстр: Лезо Темряви” спеціальна новела створена у форматі
“читачами для чатачів”. Вона не має мети стати глобальним бестселлером, що
визнана багатьма критиками; навпаки, новела має бути якомога ближчою до читача;
і сам читач має життєвоважливий внесок в її успіх. Тому кожне видання цієї
новели побудовано та опубліковано за допомогою краудсорсінгу та краудфандінгу,
де люди бажають втілити у життя їх зусилля, або фінанси, або і те і інше.
Більш того, “Монстр: Лезо Темряви” це лише перша частина повної
науково-фантастичної трилогії “Монстр”, що присвячена дослідженню, як людство взаємодіє з навколишнім
середовищем у теперішньому часі і як ця взаємодія може розвиватись у
майбутньому. Трилогія покриває аспекти захисту природи, консервації
біорозмаїття, етичної людської поведінки, бізнес етики, впливу технологій на
вчинки людей, і, звісно ж, романтичні відносини двох людей, що закохуються.
У першій
частині трилогії “Монстр” ти познайомишся з головними дійовими особами,
Джессі та Джеком, і разом з ними подорожуватимеш до віддаленого тропічного острову, щоб врятувати місцеве плем’я, дізнатися про
містичного монстра, що блукає там, та дослідити весь острів. Разом з Джессі та Джеком ти зустрінеш плем’я жертв від природнього лиха, відслідкуєш відбитки містичної природи у глибині
тропічних джунглів, полюватимеш разом з досвідченими снайперами та
бойовими роботами, будеш
досліджувати невідомі малюнки та
символи у темряві печери та протягом
всього цього насолодишся захопливою красою острівного природного середовища та
дізнаєшся про функції його екосистеми.
Щоб дізнатись більше про новелу відвідай www.themonster.info.
Науково-фантастичні
пригоди у новелі “Монстр: Лезо Темряви” перекладені на мелодійну українську мову та

Hello,
dear Amazing Friend!
We
are Alexander, Aleksandra, Alexandra, and Lada, the authors,
translators, and editors of the science fiction novel “The Monster: Blade of Darkness”. While
Alexander comes from the Republic of Moldova (although he has some Ukrainian
blood), the rest of us were born in Ukraine.From
its very beginning the dream of the novel “The
Monster: Blade of Darkness” was realized due to crowdsourced support from
many wonderful and kind individuals in different countries. It was originally
written by Alexander and released in August 2014 in Moldova on the basis of
readers’ support gathered via crowdfunding campaign. The novel was then translated
into English by an amazing reader from Sweden, Erika Rydergard, and its
English version published by Wolfgang
Stricker from Austria through his publishing house “serendii”. And the illustrations for
the book were kindly provided by the artists Kärt Viljalo from Estonia and Catherine Starostenko
from Ukraine.After
joining the community of readers and supporters of “The Monster: Blade of Darkness” we, Aleksandra,
Alexandra, and Lada, decided that it would be great to have it also translated
and published in the beautiful language of our home country, Ukrainian. And so
we joined forces with Alexander and started preparing the Ukrainian edition of
the novel.
Nowadays
we have finalized the translation of “The
Monster: Blade of Darkness” and are preparing the book for publishing and
distribution to the readers in Ukraine, who are already eager to receive and
read it. And for this we ask for YOUR support, dear Friend.

A general consensus would be yes, there is a difference. The difference between the Old and the New Testament, and therefore the prayers of Abraham, Moses, the Prophets…etc is not what is said, but that in the Old Testament the hope was future oriented. God’s kingdom had not come to earth. In the New Testament the timeline of hope changed.  It is still future oriented, in part, but the hope was realized in the empty grave Jesus left behind. In the Old Testament people asked God to smite their enemies. People were only worried about their own kingdoms. In the New Testament, Jesus taught his disciples to pray for their enemies and to pray for God’s kingdom to come to earth.</p><p>The Old Testament is violent. It just may be that the violence of the Old Testament has more to do with the violent nature of the writers than the nature of the God they worship.  Christians have committed atrocities in the name of Jesus.  Does that automatically mean Jesus is a violent, blood thirsty Lord?  Of course not.  A person cannot read the prophets without acknowledging that God is a God of love and forgiveness, a God who shows mercy when he doesn’t have to, a God concerned for the needs of the poor and oppressed. The Old Testament God is a God who rescues and protects and saves.</p><p>By ignoring differences in composition, we assume differences in message.  In the Gospels, Jesus tells people to love their neighbors. In the Torah, God tells His people not to covet their neighbor’s property. Jesus’ words come down to us through the composition of the gospel.  God’s words to Moses came down through law.  Therefore, Jesus sounds much less legalistic, but is the New Testament actually telling us anything new from the Old Testament? No. In Fact, what we think of as Jesus’ golden rule, “Love the Lord with all your heart, soul and strength and love your neighbor as yourself,” is, in fact, a step up of Deuteronomy and Leviticus. </p><p>There are many issues with this attitude. Men have re-written the Bible over this.  The Old Testament is seldom read by today’s “New Testament” Christians. Their judgment is based on rumor, speculation and hearsay. </p><p>So what does this all have to do with prayer? It means that the longings of the Old and New Testaments are not as different as we think.  Let’s take the time to look at the Prophets and the Patriarchs who wanted to see a day of righteousness and peace come to earth, as Jesus wanted when He said, “Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done..”</p><p> </p></div>","Before looking at the prayers of the Prophets and the Patriarchs, there are a few items that need to be brought out for clarity as to what may seem to be differences in the nature of the Old and New Testament prayers.Many Christians tend to be anti-Old Testament.

The Old Testament God is a God who rescues and protects and saves.By ignoring differences in composition, we assume differences in message.  In the Gospels, Jesus tells people to love their neighbors. In the Torah, God tells His people not to covet their neighbor’s property. Jesus’ words come down to us through the composition of the gospel.  God’s words to Moses came down through law.  Therefore, Jesus sounds much less legalistic, but is the New Testament actually telling us anything new from the Old Testament? No. In Fact, what we think of as Jesus’ golden rule, “Love the Lord with all your heart, soul and strength and love your neighbor as yourself,” is, in fact, a step up of Deuteronomy and Leviticus. There are many issues with this attitude. Men have re-written the Bible over this.  The Old Testament is seldom read by today’s “New Testament” Christians. Their judgment is based on rumor, speculation and hearsay. So what does this all have to do with prayer? It means that the longings of the Old and New Testaments are not as different as we think.  Let’s take the time to look at the Prophets and the Patriarchs who wanted to see a day of righteousness and peace come to earth, as Jesus wanted when He said, “Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done..”",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>2006. When it all began : our first work on the mysterious landscapes of the Renaissance's paintings</h2><div>
<div>  <p>All began in 2006 with a similar work, when we noticed some resemblances between the hills near the country-house of Rosetta and the  landscape represented in some Renaissance art work. Following that intuition, we began our hard work and in 2008 we published the book “The invisible landscape” which disclosed the details of the landscape behind the subjects painted by Piero della Francesca in his masterpieces. </p>That book was a great success and helped us start a longer and deeper research work about the landscapes of this territory,  the birthplace of the Renaissance.</div>
<div>In that year we established the cultural association ""Montefeltro Vedute Rinascimentali"" (""Montefeltro's Renaissance Views"") whose main purpose is to promote this territory as the birthplace of many Renaissance paintings.</div>

<p>
</p>
<p>The Mona Lisa is the most visited painting in the
world. Every year 9 million people see it in the Louvre Museum, in Paris. A lot
of eyes are put on it, but there's very little knowledge about its content, nowadays.</p>
<p>Indeed, for 500 years, the landscape behind the Mona
Lisa has been considered a mystery. Art historians have struggled
and failed to understand their real location and most of them have concluded
that they were imaginary. Until Rosetta Borchia e Olivia Nesci precisely and
scientifically identified them in a wide territory across the Italian regions
of Marche, Tuscany, Emilia-Romagna and Umbria, that is most of the ancient Dukedom of
Urbino. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1113890/files/20141223102814-imm_Ducato_Urbino.png?1419359294"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The book describes and provides evidence of this revolutionary
discovery, by means of images and drawings which compare the details of the
painting and the photographs of the existing landscape, decrypting the
geometrical code that Leonardo used to compress the territory of the whole Dukedom
of Urbino in that tiny painting : the aerial view and the bifocal perspective.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The work lasted five years, during which Rosetta and Olivia searched every little corner of that territory.</p>
<p>Thanks to modern technologies such as the aerial view, drone fly and satellite images analysis, this method represents an innovation for all researchers in the history of art. </p>
<p>Many codes by Leonardo, such as the Arundel Code (Royal Library of London), were studied by Rosetta and Olivia who identified among them six sketches for the preparation of the Mona Lisa. These drafts hadn't been recognized before. All these drawings by Leonardo confirmed what Rosetta and Olivia had intuited at the beginning of the project about the identification of the secret landscape. </p>

<h2><b>Our previous book on the same subject.  </b></h2>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In 2012 we published the book “Code P : Illustrated Atlas of the real landscape of the Mona
Lisa”, edited by Mondadori Electa. It was available only in Italian.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The book was quickly sold out and the few people who could buy those limited copies appreciated the work, but unfortunately it hasn't been printed anymore, since an agreement between the authors and the editor hasn’t been found. </p>
<p>The results of that work were presented in 2013 in Paris, at the International Conference of Geomorphology, and the scientific committee approved them.</p>
<p>Citations in Wikipedia of this work already exist.<br/></p>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We strongly believe that we can't stop now and that this sensational discovery must be brought to everyone. We must find the funds to publish again the book, this time in English and without a limited number of copies. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">People from all the world have to right to know the truth about the Mona Lisa, an art work which represents the mankind.</span><br/></p>
<p>Here comes the idea of this brand new and much more international project. </p>
<p>The work will consist of a complete review and
updating of the previous book, “Code P”. The format of an Illustrated Atlas will
be used again but it will be provided with many new contents : archive
documents relevant to the landscape and to the frequentation of Urbino by
Leonardo da Vinci ; new lanscapes found on the Arundel <span>Code; the friendship between Leonardo da Vinci and Raffaello when they lived in Rome and in Urbino; also,  a new and even more precise image analysis will be done.</span></p>
<p><span>Furthermore,in the same period of our long work, it happened that an Italian professor of history, Roberto Zapperi, published a revolutionary essay  about the real identity of
the painted dame, proving that she actually was Pacifica Brandani from Urbino and
not the believed Lisa from Firenze. That book tells the fascinating love story between Pacifica  and Giuliano De Medici. This discovery confirms once more our research.</span></p>
<p>The book will be printed with an excellent quality of
graphics on a high quality paper, thus allowing the reader to easily feel
himself “walking inside” this monumental and complex painting, as the authors
has done during their path toward the discovery of the landscape. </p>

<h2><b>Our history</b></h2>
<p></p>
<p>Rosetta Borchia holds a degree from the Academy
of Fine Arts of Urbino and is a painter and a photographer of landscapes.
She is also a keen naturalist and a hunter of ancient roses and rare
wildflowers, as well as a garden designer. In 2006, after taking some pictures
of the Metauro Valley, she discovered that she had captured the same hill that
Piero della Francesca had painted right below Federico da Montefeltro’s chin in
the Diptych of the Dukes of Urbino.</p>
<p>Olivia Nesci is Associate Professor of Physical
Geography at the University of Urbino. Her scientific activity has been
conducted in the field of geomorphology. Her best-known works concern the
genesis and evolution of the physical landscape of Central-Northern Italy and
cultural geomorphology. </p>

Hello everybody !We are two friends with a great passion for the history of the art : Olivia (a professor of geomorphology at the university) and Rosetta (a landscape painter and photographer)....and here is our incredible story ....For 500 years, the landscape of the most famous art work
in the world, the Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci, has been considered a mystery. But one day, in the valleys around Urbino, in the region of central Italy where the Renaissance was born, we realized to be literally walking inside that painting. At a first glance, we almost couldn’t believe our eyes, but in the following years it all revealed to be incredibly true !


With this book our main purpose is to make the reader live our same experience of this
sensational discovery. It was a great emotion, you can be sure of that !The book discloses, by means of scientific
methodologies, even the tiniest details of the territory that the Maestro
Leonardo da Vinci painted behind the Mona Lisa, be means of a complex geometrical code
that has now been decrypted. 
2006. When it all began : our first work on the mysterious landscapes of the Renaissance's paintings
  All began in 2006 with a similar work, when we noticed some resemblances between the hills near the country-house of Rosetta and the  landscape represented in some Renaissance art work. Following that intuition, we began our hard work and in 2008 we published the book “The invisible landscape” which disclosed the details of the landscape behind the subjects painted by Piero della Francesca in his masterpieces. That book was a great success and helped us start a longer and deeper research work about the landscapes of this territory,  the birthplace of the Renaissance.
In that year we established the cultural association ""Montefeltro Vedute Rinascimentali"" (""Montefeltro's Renaissance Views"") whose main purpose is to promote this territory as the birthplace of many Renaissance paintings.



2014. Today's project :  the book “The secret landscape of Mona Lisa : the Dukedom of Urbino.”


The Mona Lisa is the most visited painting in the
world. Every year 9 million people see it in the Louvre Museum, in Paris. A lot
of eyes are put on it, but there's very little knowledge about its content, nowadays.
Indeed, for 500 years, the landscape behind the Mona
Lisa has been considered a mystery. Art historians have struggled
and failed to understand their real location and most of them have concluded
that they were imaginary. Until Rosetta Borchia e Olivia Nesci precisely and
scientifically identified them in a wide territory across the Italian regions
of Marche, Tuscany, Emilia-Romagna and Umbria, that is most of the ancient Dukedom of
Urbino. 


The book describes and provides evidence of this revolutionary
discovery, by means of images and drawings which compare the details of the
painting and the photographs of the existing landscape, decrypting the
geometrical code that Leonardo used to compress the territory of the whole Dukedom
of Urbino in that tiny painting : the aerial view and the bifocal perspective.

The work lasted five years, during which Rosetta and Olivia searched every little corner of that territory.
Thanks to modern technologies such as the aerial view, drone fly and satellite images analysis, this method represents an innovation for all researchers in the history of art. 
Many codes by Leonardo, such as the Arundel Code (Royal Library of London), were studied by Rosetta and Olivia who identified among them six sketches for the preparation of the Mona Lisa. These drafts hadn't been recognized before. All these drawings by Leonardo confirmed what Rosetta and Olivia had intuited at the beginning of the project about the identification of the secret landscape. 











Our previous book on the same subject.  



In 2012 we published the book “Code P : Illustrated Atlas of the real landscape of the Mona
Lisa”, edited by Mondadori Electa. It was available only in Italian.

The book was quickly sold out and the few people who could buy those limited copies appreciated the work, but unfortunately it hasn't been printed anymore, since an agreement between the authors and the editor hasn’t been found. 
The results of that work were presented in 2013 in Paris, at the International Conference of Geomorphology, and the scientific committee approved them.
Citations in Wikipedia of this work already exist.








We strongly believe that we can't stop now and that this sensational discovery must be brought to everyone. We must find the funds to publish again the book, this time in English and without a limited number of copies. People from all the world have to right to know the truth about the Mona Lisa, an art work which represents the mankind.
Here comes the idea of this brand new and much more international project. 
The work will consist of a complete review and
updating of the previous book, “Code P”. The format of an Illustrated Atlas will
be used again but it will be provided with many new contents : archive
documents relevant to the landscape and to the frequentation of Urbino by
Leonardo da Vinci ; new lanscapes found on the Arundel Code; the friendship between Leonardo da Vinci and Raffaello when they lived in Rome and in Urbino; also,  a new and even more precise image analysis will be done.
Furthermore,in the same period of our long work, it happened that an Italian professor of history, Roberto Zapperi, published a revolutionary essay  about the real identity of
the painted dame, proving that she actually was Pacifica Brandani from Urbino and
not the believed Lisa from Firenze. That book tells the fascinating love story between Pacifica  and Giuliano De Medici. This discovery confirms once more our research.
The book will be printed with an excellent quality of
graphics on a high quality paper, thus allowing the reader to easily feel
himself “walking inside” this monumental and complex painting, as the authors
has done during their path toward the discovery of the landscape. 

Our history

Rosetta Borchia holds a degree from the Academy
of Fine Arts of Urbino and is a painter and a photographer of landscapes.
She is also a keen naturalist and a hunter of ancient roses and rare
wildflowers, as well as a garden designer. In 2006, after taking some pictures
of the Metauro Valley, she discovered that she had captured the same hill that
Piero della Francesca had painted right below Federico da Montefeltro’s chin in
the Diptych of the Dukes of Urbino.
Olivia Nesci is Associate Professor of Physical
Geography at the University of Urbino. Her scientific activity has been
conducted in the field of geomorphology. Her best-known works concern the
genesis and evolution of the physical landscape of Central-Northern Italy and
cultural geomorphology.

<h3>Writers' Group:</h3>
<p>I'm Brad Combs, the founder of the Writers' Group on Facebook, one of the largest and fastest growing groups for writers on social media. I've always had a passion for fiction since childhood. But my true love for what writing could do started in elementary school when I discovered the early interactive fiction/text adventure game ZORK on a computer at the local community college. That transformed my life and gave my education the purpose that it needed to to see me through.<br/>Today, I'm well into my career as an artist, writer and teacher. My journeys have taken me far beyond the small farm towns of Illinois all the way to ""Bright Light City,"" Las Vegas, NV. As a creative resources engineer, technician and consultant in Las Vegas I've seen all the highs. But, I've also seen the lows. Like many when they come to Las Vegas with only the clothes on their backs and a dream, I spent nearly a month without a place to call home, sleeping in the cab of my late father's pickup truck. Since those days I've always had a great appreciation for the person living on the streets with even less to protect them from cold of winter and heat of summer. It doesn't take much, a stolen purse, a lot ID, just a series of bad breaks for temporary homelessness to become more of a permanent condition.</p>
<p>In ancient times the notion of a home was slightly different. A person could travel from place to place trading stories and news in exchange for room and board without earning a label ""homeless."" In fact, this became a career for many. They were called bards and were loved by many cultures. Today, we get our stories and news instantly from technology and the oral tradition is nothing like what it was. Travel writers who are constantly on the go, away from the place they consider their permanent residences, are the types of people who come close to the lifestyle of old. Some, have given up the idea of a sedentary life and are on the road permanently. Although most homeless didn't make the same choice, it's only a matter of changing mindset and intent and they can feel as though they're not homeless but travel writers using the streets to get to where they're going, even if it's only for a short while.</p>
<p>Street Pens is an attempt to reintroduce the opportunity of being a storyteller to those who wander from place to place.</p>
<p>Regardless of why people lose their homes it's almost never their chosen outcome for their current housing status. Few desire to be homeless. So, when it happens it's often an emotional blow that leads to depression and despair. Most in this situation feel hopeless and see no way back into a life where they live in a structure suitable for housing people with respectable living conditions including utilities, heat, and clean running water.</p>
<p>On top of the stigma that comes with being homeless, the logistical quagmire of lifting oneself out of it is a ""catch 22."" It's difficult to find employment if a person doesn't have an address to put on an job application. Nor do most in this situation have functional means of mobile communication. They can't afford a phone. But without a job, how does one pay rent or a mortgage? It's easy just to give up all hope of ever returning to it.<br/>Sometimes, even people with jobs are without homes for one reason or another.</p>
<p>Volume 1 of Street Pens will focus on the homeless of Las Vegas. People come to the city in search of the big jackpot. While some change their lives with a massive win, most just don't hit that big. Often, in the relentless pursuit of striking it rich, they neglect to care for other areas of their life. Sometimes, if things line up in just the wrong way, it can lead to disaster and the unforeseen result of being without a home, if not worse.<br/><br/>With the help of local communities and individuals like you, we hope that writing can create a path to the better lives that the people of Las Vegas came to the city in search of in the first place. Funds will go to not only writing equipment but also to arrange to have their writing transcribed onto digital media, rewards for participants whose work is selected for the Street Pens publication, to develop the web site and more. To do all this we need to arrange gathering times for our writers and their volunteers who wish to help. We'll arrange to have them schedule a future meeting time and day for subsequent visits.<br/><br/>If you haven't had a chance to discover the work being done for the homeless by the CARE Complex in Downtown Las Vegas, you really should familiarize yourself with the great people, our partners, because they're doing things differently.

<p>Risks and challenges</p>
<p>Literacy: Are homeless people literate? Yes they are. However, as part of the strategy of this project we'll partner with various organizations and/or authors to provide used books to homeless shelters in an effort to encourage and increase literacy.</p>
<p>Safety: Going from one encampment of the homeless to the next brings with it its own set of challenges, not least of which is safety. While the impression is that homeless people will resort to nefarious means to get what they need to survive, that's true for just about any of the rest of society. It's not so much the homeless themselves who are the danger. It's the areas they manage to get away with living in. In upper class neighborhoods homeless are usually seen as a nuisance to be dealt with and removed. And they <i>are</i> dealt with. For the same reason, upper class neighborhoods are not neighborhoods where drug dealers and gangs are common. The homeless and the underbelly of society typically coexist in the same areas of town. Visiting the homeless brings one into territory controlled by elements that can at time be unpredictable. This is why we're localizing the first volume of Street Pens to Las Vegas, but immediately using what we learn to nationalize, possibly even globalize, its reach.</p>
<p>Supplies: This is the easy part. A significant part of the purpose of this campaign is to purchase writing pens and paper.</p>
<p>Digital transfer: at subsequent follow up meetings with our volunteers we'll educate participants on how to utilize public access to technology to be able to transcribe their work into digital manuscripts.</p>
<p>Production: the collected works will be judged and compiled and produced into an anthology that will be made available for purchase via Amazon and other online book retailers. The proceeds of net sales of which will go to further the mission of this project into other geographic regions and urban areas.</p>
<p>Documentation of the process: if a budget permits, equipment and manpower will be needed to film and document the process of this project.</p>
<p>Corporate Sponsorship: there are a variety of ways corporations can get involved in this effort. For example, a restaurant chain may want to cater monthly ""cook outs"" that we'll host in order to bring our writers back in begin collating their work.</p>

In basic learning, how to do things and understanding of different ways of life and differing cultures. This book offers all these things in an informative way that will help the reader understand more about Russia and its own way of thinking and doing. Understanding brings people closer together. Contributors to the book will help to get a project going that attempts to do this.What We Need & What You Get Costs BreakdownThe funding target covers the entire costs of publication including editorial assistance/revision , proof reading, cover design ,Interior layout design, audio recording, paperback and hard back printing, e book and kindle cost extras, translations, promotional and digital marketing and shipping for this first volume. All Contributors will get a copy of the book in their chosen format with additional perks available for higher contributions.RiskIf we do not raise the entire £12,500 we will use what we do raise and find other funds to complete the project. We are committed to having the book published and will use your generous contributions - whatever amount you give.Other Ways You Can HelpSome people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:Please share my Pre-sale Campaign on Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn with your friends, family and network. You can easily share my Pre-Sale Campaign Page via Indiegogo at the top of the page.Please also share my book with as many personal friends as you feel able as well as family members, co-workers and anyone whom you might think would enjoy it.

<h3>...So What Does That Mean?</h3>
<p>That means that Penclash is the place to put your writing skills to the test, while also improving as a author. Invariably, the three most important tasks for any developing writer are writing more, reading more, and getting feedback on what they've written. Penclash gives you the opportunity to do all three through the medium of friendly competition, and gives you the chance to meet and engage with other authors.</p>

<p><strong>Monthly Penclash: A monthly site-wide contest.</strong><br/>The site's main 'official' contest, Monthly Penclash runs, as one would expect, once each month. The nature of the contest will vary, with different prompts, story lengths, and criteria each month. Placement in these competitions will be tracked on a site-wide leaderboard. These competitions will be anonymously judged by their participants, which means you'll be getting feedback—and encouragement—from each other.</p>
<p><strong>User-Created Contests: Fun with friends.</strong><br/>Users can also create their own contests using Penclash. With a wide variety of options to choose from, you'll be able to create just about any kind of writing contest you can think of—and then let Penclash manage submissions for you.</p>
<p>It's not just for individuals, either—if you're a publication looking for material, a publisher looking for talent, or a business looking for promotion, this is the place to do it.</p>
<p><strong>Workshops: Organized competition.</strong><br/>Workshops are user-created, self-contained groups with their own forums and leaderboards. Workshops can be organized around any given topic, and can run their own local contests—members-only.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/419758748823715842/571796110683799573/Prompts.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Penclash also offers the <strong>Library</strong>, where you can search and read through an organized list of every contest entry on the site. Looking for a quick read? We've got you covered.</p>
<p><strong>Other planned features include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Dark mode</li>
<li>Integrations with popular fiction hosting sites, including cross-login</li>
<li>A powerful and exhaustive BBCode-based formatting system, with WYSIWYG editing support</li>

<h3>Who Are You, Exactly?</h3>
<p>I'm an aspiring author and professional web developer.  I've been writing fiction since 2012, working on a novel since 2015, and making websites for over half a decade.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What do You Need All This Money For?</h3>
<p>Good question! Penclash is currently about 30% complete, and while I'd like to keep working on it for free, I don't have the funds to work on it full-time anymore. That's where your contributions come in!</p>
<p>Besides paying my rent, your money will also go towards covering initial server and development costs, legal fees, and a small portion will be set aside for marketing. Any funds we receive over our goal will be put towards improving Penclash going forwards—and a few special surprises for its users.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>When Will it be Done?</h3>
<p>I expect to have Penclash finished and ready for use by late 2019/early 2020. Once it's ready, we'll enter a closed beta stage for our backers, which should last only a few months as we iron out any issues. After that, it'll be unleashed onto the world at large, likely around early-to-mid-2020.</p>
<h3>What Happens if You Don't Reach Your Goal?</h3>
<p>If there is sufficient interest, Penclash still gets made—it'll just take longer. If there isn't, then all pledges will be immediately refunded, and it's back to the drawing board.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>But I'm just a Starving Author. How Can I Help?</h3>
<p>Spread the word! Share this page with your friends, your social media subscribers, and anywhere else you can. In this early stage, exposure is just as important as funding.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name's <u>Constanza Mayer</u> and I'm the author of<strong> ""The Battle of the Erathiel: Across the Enchanted Sea""</strong>. I've been writing for as long as I can remember and as an <u>Indie author</u> I am looking for some support (of any kind, really) to get book 2 out there. Let me tell you a bit about my <i>Epic Fantasy series</i> and plans for this <u>crazy</u>, <strong>long</strong> story.</p>
<p>As I mentioned before, this series narrates the story of <u>a group of elves</u>, the <strong>Erathiel</strong>, and their few <u>human and dwarven allies</u> who abandon their home and cross the <i>Enchanted Sea</i> in search of a new home. They miraculously reach a harbor with nothing in sight, except for a <u>desert</u>, and begin their journey to find a more hospitable location. However, they run into a violent group of <strong>lizardfolk </strong>who attack them and soon let them know that there is one, <i>a great wizard</i>, who does not welcome them to <i>""his""</i> land: <u><strong>Delufer</strong></u>.</p>
<p>Later in their journey, when they make friends with the <u>peaceful <strong>Orach</strong></u> who live in harmony up in the mountains, they discover how cruel Delufer can be and what his plan is for the free people of <strong>Dôr Annon</strong>. The Erathiel decide to <i>take a stand</i>, join forces with the Orach and teach them the ways of war so that evil does not destroy this land, too. Outnumbered, the Orach suggest <u>they travel south</u> to speak with the <strong>Beither</strong>, fellow allies, and <i>warriors</i>, to join them in their stand against Delufer. <i><u><strong>This is where book 2 begins </strong></u></i>(which is already written, I just need to get it edited and checked).</p>
<p>I created a world that is <u>inspired by</u><strong> South America</strong>. For example, when they arrive at a desert, I thought of the <i><u>Atacama Desert</u></i> to inspire me; when they meet the Orach in the mountains, I thought of<i><u> the Incas</u></i> and the beautiful<strong> Macchu Picchu</strong>; and as they travel south I've thought of the lovely Chilean landscape and it's magnificent <strong>Cordillera de Los Andes</strong> to guide the company. Furthermore, the mysterious <strong>Amazons </strong>and the people who live inside will be something you will see in book 2, and especially in book 3.</p>
<p>I'm passionate about the idea of a fantasy series that's<u> inspired by diversity</u>, by<strong> Latin American culture</strong>, and also by <u>many others</u> (as you will discover in <strong>book 3</strong>). <i><u><strong>A big melting pot in a Fantasy context is what I hope to create</strong></u></i>, along with topics which I find are important and crucial to our time, such as <strong>racism</strong>, <strong>discrimination</strong>, <strong>immigration</strong>, <strong>war</strong>, taking care of our <strong>environment</strong>, animal <strong>cruelty</strong>, <strong>LGBTQ+</strong> community, and how <i><u>our society does not need to destroy others to thrive</u></i>.</p>
<p><strong>""The Battle of the Erathiel""</strong> is a story of <u>adventure, friendship, tolerance, and peace</u>. It touches classical themes like good versus evil, the importance of working together, and the idea that good triumphs over evil (although it is not the case 100% of the time, sadly). </p>
<p><strong>I hope that you can help me on this mission to get this book out there, in its best version possible, and to send a message of hope, a story much like our own but in a fantasy world.</strong></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Let's get down to the nitty-gritty (as Nacho Libre would say): where will your money go? Well, it'll go straight into my bank account BUT after that, I will use it to pay for all the copywriting and editing that my book needs before I publish it and make it available for your all :D</p>
<p>Believe it or not, editorial services are <strong>very expensive</strong> and when you're an Indie author, you don't have many options. I am currently editing it myself, but it even after I finish editing all of it, it could not compare to the work that a professional editor and copywriter can achieve. Also, I would like to set up a professional author page and choose a compelling cover for my book.</p>
<p>I truly believe my readers, well, all readers, deserve the best we can offer them, so that is what I'm aiming for. </p>
<p><u>What will you get out of helping me?</u> Well, a free copy of the first book, perhaps a <strong>free</strong> copy of the first and the second, a <strong>signed</strong> copy, added to the people I <strong>acknowledge</strong> and thank in my book. Also, we can Skype, talk about fantasy or anything related to my book :D and if you're <strong>very lucky</strong>, you can purchase the option to <u><strong>be an ""extra"" in my book</strong></u> (however, I cannot guarantee your character will live xD) and get a mention in my book.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>You don't NEED to donate to help :D (although of course, it helps xD) but you can always help by <strong>sharing this campaign</strong>, telling your friends about it, purchasing a copy of my first book (printed or ebook), by leaving words of encouragement, or even offering editorial services if you happen to know about all that :D </p>

<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get:</strong></p>
<p>As you can see, this 500+ page adult fantasy novel will have many illustrations (one per chapter). My goal is to finish the writing and complete the illustrations, then publish, print and ship and book to each person who supports this campaign.</p>
<p>Writing and drawing is the easy part (it just requires time on my part,) but the printing and shipping is why I need your support to help fund this campaign. That's why I'm asking for $20,000 and your patience to complete an incredible story which combines elements from modern classics like The Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones with ancient epics such as Gilgamesh and Genesis.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Perks:</strong></p>
<p>There are 4 perks for this campaign:</p>
<p>1. $10 for the digital e-book in .pdf form (with NO chapter illustrations for novel purists)</p>
<p>2. $15 for the digital e-book in .pdf form (with full-colored chapter illustrations for art fans)</p>
<p>3. $25 for a physical 9x6 paperback copy of the novel (with NO chapter illustrations, and the .pdf from Perk #1)</p>
<p>4. $30 for a physical 9x6 paperback copy of the novel (with full-colored chapter illustrations, and the .pdf from Perk #2)</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Impact:</strong></p>
<p>This is my first novel, part 1 of 2, which I'm writing and illustrating for the sheer love of storytelling and art. I would do it for free, to be honest, but the reality of publishing, printing, and shipping necessitated the creation of this campaign.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges:</strong></p>
<p>The goal of $20,000 is to cover the production of (hopefully) 1000 perfect-bound softcovers. However, if the full goal is not reached, each perk has been calculated to ensure that the backer who chose said perk will be able to fund the production of their copy, provided the minimum threshold is reached for printing.</p>
<p>The risks themselves are minimal, since most of the novel has been written already. Essentially, the ""E-book (no illustrations)"" perk is all but ready, whereas the rest require more time to complete (the chapter illustrations, printing, etc.) I would prefer to have all the perks ready to go before sending out the no-art version of the .pdf to backers of the ""E-book (no illustrations)"" perk, but that may change as explained below.</p>
<p>Completion of the illustrations (which I am doing 100% of the layout, art, and colors) will take at least several months with my current schedule, so I ask for your patience and understanding. If a minimum amount of funding is not reached, however, it will not be feasible for me to complete the chapter illustrations and all backers of the ""E-book (with illustrations)"" perk and the ""Book (with illustrations)"" perk will receive the ""no illustrations"" version of their chosen perk, which can then be delivered months earlier than expected.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help:</strong></p>
<p>This campaign will be running for a few months, so if you are not able to support it at this time through monetary means, please help spread the word about how awesome Epochs of Eternity could be with enough support!</p>
<p>Thank you all so much for the opportunity to share my dream project with the world.</p>

<h2>What is Inknexus?</h2>
<p>At its core Inknexus is a story board where someone begins a tale, and then after posting other members can carry on from where the last left off.<br/>A completed story features six members each writing a piece roughly 400-600 words long to create a unique story that can be read in the space of a lunch break or on the train to work.</p>
<p>Each story has its own comments section, can be rated and uses our Color Band System to inform readers of a stories content before it’s even opened.</p>
<p>Inknexus is divided in to 7 category based story boards, along with an open board where members are not restricted and can post any length or feature as many or few writers as they like from poetry to full novels. There is also a discussion board where members can ask questions, get to know the community and collaborate on a specific project.</p>
<h2>What else does it do?</h2>
<p>Inknexus has a powerful framework with an easy to navigate directory of all our members. Once singed up every member has a profile listing all their stories, the ability to add friends and send private messages, follow their favorite members and subscribe to a story to easily keep track of a piece still being developed. The platform will be community driven and take much of its future direction from the user.</p>
<p>The platform features a blog centered on the relationship between readers and authors, along with useful information and guest posts.</p>
<p><strong>Indie Focused</strong></p>
<p>While Inknexus is open to everyone it was specifically created with the Indie Author in mind, giving them a platform to showcase a taste of their work and reach new readers and old fans in a unique way without the reader having to lay down a cent.</p>
<p>Authors have extended profiles and can sign up and post stories that other members can work with them on, essentially sharing the page with their favorites or giving a voice to new up and coming talent.</p>
<p>The platform features a section for all registered author’s new releases, including full descriptions, useful information, teasers and unique interviews you won’t find anywhere else.</p>
<p><strong>Our promise</strong></p>
<p>To keep it free for all Inknexus will feature non-intrusive advertising and in addition we promise to pledge <i>25% of our revenue</i> back in to the community.</p>
<p>Inknexus will feature regular competitions for both readers and posted stories, focusing on helping those just starting out to get their work published and in to the hands of the public.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Unlike many projects here, as of right now Inknexus is fully functional and will be launched on the 31st July 2017, but to really get it to where we want it to be it needs some extra love. So we’re raising funds to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Optimize the site for mobile devices</li>
<li>Add additional security features</li>
<li>Include user experience improvements like additional story formatting, extra member profile features and improved functionality and layout</li>
<li>Acquire quality recording equipment and software to turn the platform's blog in to a vlog that will also be posted on youtube</li>
</ul>
<p>If we manage to go beyond our funding goal of $2000 we will use any extra funds to get additional content, continue to add new features and implement many ideas still in the works.</p>
<p><i>Every cent of the funding we do not spend will be used in our first competitions.</i></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, I’m Kristina Savova, a forensic psychologist and the author of the ten books of the series ""I'm Not a Book"". When my son had difficulties learning and speaking because of hyperactivity and attention deficit, I struggled to find all sorts of fun and creative ways of communicating, playing, learning and teaching, while trying to explain and resolve the inner struggles and poor sociability he experienced every day. It's not easy or happy for a five-year-old boy, to acknowledge that none of the children from his class will run to him in the morning, shouting his name just to let him know they are excited to see him and that they want to play. Obviously, that broke my heart, but I realized that the children or the parents have enough knowledge to deal with situations like this. And this is how this project came around. I wanted to do something special, not just for my child but for all the children that experience difficulties, to help them cope with those in a world that can embrace us and love us the same way, no matter how different we are.  </p>
<p>The words in these books are real, playful, and mysterious. They intend to embrace autism, anxiety, parent separation, death, and any persistent difficulty a child experiences. Each book will have one difficulty. Behind these words, I hid coping mechanisms to be found in every clue. These words are for every parent talking to their kids. They’re for every kid that hasn't got a friend. These books are for teachers, parents, and kids to learn about love, kindness, and how they’re connected to the world around them. These books are for anyone who holds someone near and dear to their heart. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order for these ten books to launch, I need your help! You can pre-order the book and earn other incredible, exclusive perks by contributing to the campaign. I am printing an 8.25x8.25, high-quality hardcover book to ensure the best product for you. These funds will go towards:</p>
<p>- the printing and shipment of the first run of books</p>
<p>- illustrator expenses </p>
<p>- shipping and packaging of all rewards</p>
<p>-e-book conversion &amp; design</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I believe we can make a difference by just smiling at a person who walks past us, in a coffee shop, at the grocery store, or even on a subway. But when we think of children, the future of our world, and generations, we think of love. We think of ways to make them grow mostly by being children and by feeling happy. This way no matter how many obstacles they may find on their paths, they will always be able to achieve their goals with less pain, loneliness, or struggle. And never give up.</p>
<p>I would like through the books to sensibilize and recall, every mother or father, grandmother or grandfather, sister or brother, neighbors, teachers, or the entire community, the importance of embracing these kids, showing them love, understanding, and help them through with a simple smile. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As I introduced myself earlier, I'm a psychologist and a writer with wide arms and enthusiasm, but a book or books can be a challenge regarding the entire process of writing a book until it is available on the shelves or in the hands of our readers. From experience, many things can go wrong, but I realize that if you choose a reliable illustrator, editor, and a secure printing and transportation company, the risk reduces drastically. The challenge is that every single intervenient has a budget that is not affordable to anyone that has the knowledge to share and a desire to give love and smiles.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help </h3>
<p>If you're not looking to contribute right now, I could still use the support! Please consider sharing this campaign on your social media or letting friends and family know about it so they can soon add this heartwarming book to their collection.  </p>

You may already know about evolution, exponential growth, and the impacts climate change will have on future generations. There are countless who do not.</p>

</div></div>","Overview
Science has revealed to us epic cataclysms, thunderous dinosaurs, colossal extinctions, evolutionary arms races, dauntless explorations, breathtaking glimpses of the Universe, and tools to envision the future. You may already know about evolution, exponential growth, and the impacts climate change will have on future generations. There are countless who do not.
Let's excite people about science by displaying our discoveries on coffee tables in a beautiful, engaging way.

What People are Saying
Researchers, scientists, and teachers from around the world who have reviewed the early draft and illustrations have written:
“This is an exceptionally cool book, and one that I would most certainly want on my table at home. You have done a great deal of scholarly research to get the dates right, and it was fun looking things over.” — Tom Franke, Ph.D., Science Teacher, Hopkins High School

“I think your book project is really worthwhile and the artwork is stunning. I frequently teach biology classes for non-science majors who have no concept of the vast timescales of the evolution of the galaxy and of the earth and its lifeforms. If one can truly appreciate the timescale of these events (which is not easy) it puts the current pace of anthropogenic mass extinctions and climate change in dramatic perspective.” — Bruce Rannala, Ph.D., College of Biological Sciences, University of California, Davis

“Excellent illustrations and text both. I think you nailed the scope well for intelligent non-specialists and undergrads. Well done.” — James Albert, Ph.D., Department of Biology, University of Louisiana at Lafayett

“What a great idea for a book. The illustrations are great and the content is concise and well communicated.” — Ben Pearce, Ph.D. Candidate, Department of Physics and Astronomy, McMaster University

“Firstly great work so far, its a big undertaking and you are doing a magnificent job.” — Grant Cox, Ph.D., School of Physical Sciences, University of Adelaide

Other scientists have written:

“I had a quick glance and your book looks beautiful. The artwork and layout are gorgeous.” — Steve Brusatte, Ph.D., School of GeoSciences, University of Edinburgh
“What a cool project! Loved it. I can’t wait to see the final version!” — Tanai Londono, Ph.D., Faculty of Natural Sciences, Imperial College London
“Firstly, this looks really nice. I love the illustrations.” — David Naafs, Ph.D., University of Bristol
“The text is very nice and the overall volume also.” — Pavel Kroupa, Ph.D., Stellar Populations and Dynamics Research Group, University of Bonn
“The whole project looks beautiful!” — Rich Pancost, Ph.D., Professor of Biogeochemistry, University of Bristol
“I think it’s terrific! Really nicely done.” — Simon Darroch, Ph.D., Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Vanderbilt University
“I looked at the draft and it really does look nice.” — Jayant Murthy, Ph.D., Indian Institute of Astrophysics
“In general it reads very well.” — Vardan Adibekyan, Ph.D., Institute of Astrophysics and Space Sciences
“Looks like a cool project!” — Joost Frieling, Ph.D., Marine Palynology and Paleoceanography, Utrecht University

What We Need
The following picture provides an overview of how the funds will be used:

Contributing
A contribution of over $2 is the simplest way to help; use the BACK IT button to donate.
Perks
Perks are ways to contribute to the project and get something in return: from a beautiful and basic layflat coffee table photobook to a hand-crafted version on reclaimed pine paper, or even a digital version.
Funds
At the very least, the goal is to reimburse illustrators for their efforts; if we don't reach the target amount, any funds up to $11,500 will go directly to the artists.

Where We're At
The first draft of the prose has been sent to and reviewed by scientists who have studied the depicted events. Several scientific illustrations are complete, with many more due by the end of May. Two illustrations are unassigned. Remaining tasks to get the project out the door:

Incorporate pending illustrations upon completion
Revise first draft with feedback from scientists
Determine the target audience and price point for the book
Hire a professional editor to proofread the reviewed draft
Create web site and host for the finished digital version
Produce a layflat coffee table book per publisher to check quality

Making a Difference
Knowledge is the most powerful tool we have to make a difference to the world. We need more people to understand the implications of their choices. Science should be fun, easily understood, and captivatingly beautiful. Teachers need up-to-date lesson materials.
My hope is that sharing this knowledge will influence people's behavior in proactive, Earth-friendly ways.

Risks and Challenges
The biggest risk is not knowing the initial target market for the book. By earmarking funds for market research we'll be able to find and contact people in the target market.
Every few weeks I'll check in with illustrators about their progress. If no progress has been made, or the illustrator becomes unresponsive, a new illustrator will be assigned.
Unassigned Illustrations
We need illustrators for the following illustrations:

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I thought I was a believer for 20+ years but I had a lot of secret struggles I dealt with that made me feel like God was angry with me. This was how I grew up, fearful of my Father. Then I met Jesus. I set out in 2018 to write an impactful devotional with the Finished Work of the Cross in mind, and I achieved that goal when I published ""The Song of You"" on Amazon in July of 2018. I immediately had a desire to write another one geared towards middle to high school. I decided to wait a while, but I feel now is the time to start work on it.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I discovered the last time how expensive it was to get a book published the right way. Between editing costs, cover design, layout, eBook formatting, and marketing the cost was much higher than I was prepared for. So out of the goal set:</p>
<ul>
<li>$1000 is set aside for editing</li>
<li>$500 for layout and eBook formatting</li>
<li>$500 for copies to distribute as rewards for this campaign</li>
<li>$500 for preliminary marketing</li>
</ul>
<p>If the goal is not fully met the money will still help with all of the above as I will still be releasing the book. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I believe that our youth is attacked by so many things meant to strip them of their true identity, and I believe that this book will help to change their minds about who they are in Christ. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge for me if to write a devotional concise and relevant enough for today's youth and you in the future. With this in mind I will surround myself with parents, teachers, youth leaders and people generally in the know to ensure that this devotional has the most impact as it can have. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you don't have the money to participate in this fundraising campaign, that's okay. Ways you can help that will mean a lot! </p>
<ul>
<li>Share this campaign on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or wherever else you may socially interact with people. </li>

<h2>Long story short</h2>
<p>The Syphoner Saga is an addictive ongoing paranormal+horror+romance mashup series about the young, self-deprecating, but lovable Divina LeBeau as she stumbles through one dark cloud after another on her way to adulthood. On the eve of her 18th birthday, a literal pandora's box of secrets is unleashed, bringing about horrors Divina and her ""cursed"" family have only ever dreamed of. It's the end of the world as she knows it, but it could quite possibly be the end of her life as well.   </p>
<p>Book 1 is completed. Book 2 is in revision. Book 3 is in drafting. The next step is getting this series officially launched, published, printed and into the hands of readers. That's where you come in!</p>
<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p>I'm a 30-year-old novelist, writer and poet with the pen name Munzie LeStrange. I've been writing for over half my life and my style resembles if Anne Rice and Jeff Lindsay had a lovechild who happens to be both a hopeless romantic and a critical cynic. </p>
<p>I write mashup fiction - specifically horror+ [i.e. horror + paranormal romance or horror + sci-fi, etc]. I've focused my writing career on serial novels in the last five years and I have a backlog of four other series' that I plan to complete once The Syphoner Saga is out of production. </p>
<h3>Why Indiegogo?</h3>
<p>After taking the leap into indie publishing, I'd crossed my i's and dotted my t's. I did my marketing research, signed up for every ""10-steps to your first 10,000 readers"" webinars that hit my inbox, and went work building my reader network. I'd developed a pretty good-sized readership excitedly awaiting my upcoming book launch and the interviews and library tour that were to follow. </p>
<p>After the pandemic halted life as we know it, all the hard work I poured into making my book a success was suddenly irrelevant. Book launch? Cancelled. Interviews? Cancelled. Signing tour? Cancelled. I had nothing to show for my hard work except the book itself. From my beta team, my ARC readers and the few sales I've made so far, the book is exceptional, you can read some reviews <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52538090-syphoner"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a> and <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0865YZY4G#customerReviews"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>. I get emails every week from the few readers who've picked up the book asking when they can expect the rest of the series to be released (tentatively, Book 2: 12/2021, Book 3: 12/2022). </p>
<p>According to the formula, catchy cover + pristine book + good marketing = successful book.</p>
<p>Catchy cover? Check. Pristine book (edited and proofread)? Check. Marketing strategy? Check. </p>
<p>Success? Hardly. A great book can only matter if it's being read. Readers can only read books they know about. Despite everything I'm doing, I still can't reach readers. So, I'm trying something different. Crowdfunding.  </p>
<p>First, I tried Kickstarter, and my first-ever campaign (for $2500) was a success - much to my shock and awe. I found out that there were people out in the world, states and countries away that wanted to read what I love to write. I learned a lot through that experience, and I was ecstatic about the success! But, a few days after my Kickstarter campaign ended - much to my dismay - the majority of my backers were dropped! And along with them, more than 70% of my funding. I actually had to come out of pocket to fulfill the benefits I promised my backers.</p>
<p>Rather than wallow - because, let's be honest, who isn't having a difficult time right now? - I did more research about Kickstarter. I compared it with it's main competitor, Indiegogo.</p>
<p>Indiegogo seemed a little more involved with all the helpful articles and access to experts on the platform. I'm still not expecting much traction, because I'm supposed to already have 30% of my goal funded by people who know me before I can expect any kind of success. </p>
<p>Here's the deal: There are a total of six family members who actually support my writing career: my mother, my grandmother, three cousins and an uncle. Since my move to a much more rural area in January, my attempts at reader outreach are extremely limited. Not only do I have nowhere to go and network, I can't even venture out into the town to find out where my potential readers hang out. Everything is closed - and for good reason, of course - but that still leaves me at a disadvantage no matter what avenue I try.  </p>
<p>At most, I'd like to gain readers even if this campaign falls short of my goal. But, if by some miracle it does reach the goal, my whole series will be published, marketed and distributed, converted into audiobooks and promoted through very reader outlet I can get my hands on. I'll also livestream a virtual launch and signing where readers and supporters can watch their books be autographed in real time just before they're shipped out. </p>
<p>So,  what is the goal and how does it all break down?</p>
<h2>What I Need</h2>
<p>To successfully self-publish, market and distribute a book, a minimum of about $6,000 is required. For a trilogy, it's about 3x that amount. On the surface, this might seem inflated, so here's the official breakdown. </p>
<p><u><strong>For 1 book</strong></u><br/><strong>Editing</strong> = $1500 ($30/1,000 words [at the cheaper end of the spectrum for this service])<br/><strong>Proofreading</strong> = $1000 ($20/1,000 words)<br/><strong>ISBNs</strong> = $125 for 1, $295 for 10 </p>
<p> - note: each format for each book requires it's own ISBN, ex.: 1 ISBN for an ebook, a different ISBN for paperback and another for hardback of the same book. A trilogy would require a minimum of 9 ISBNs.</p>
<strong>Email Marketing</strong> = $720<p>[Mailchimp is $20/month<br/>Prolific (an email builder source) is $20/month<br/>Bookfunnel (another email builder source) is $20/month]</p> <strong>Social Marketing</strong> = $2400<p>[$50/month for Amazon<br/>$50/month for Instagram<br/>$50/month for Facebook<br/>$50/month for Twitter]</p> <i><strong>Influencer Reviews</strong> (not required, but highly impactful)</i><p><i><u>Readers Favorite</u>: $59 (cheapest option<br/><u>Kirkus</u>: $425 (cheapest option)</i></p>
<p><strong>Total: a minimum of $5915 [or $6399 including reviews)</strong></p>
<p>Also, keep in mind the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm a digital content creator, so I make my own book covers. </li>
<li>I do all my own formatting</li>
<li>I do all my own publicity and marketing (book launches, appearances, event scheduling)</li>
<li>If I added the costs of the last 3 bullet points, it could add as much as $5000 to the total</li>
</ul>
<p>No book is truly professional published (self-published or otherwise) without a marketing investment. No one can read a book if they don't know about it, and the marketing industry is 100% pay to play. It's critical for any author who dreams of making a career as an author.</p>
<h3><u>The total for 3 books breaks down like this:</u></h3>
<p><strong>Editing</strong> = $4500 ($30/1,000 words for 3 books, 50k words each)<br/><strong>Proofreading</strong> = $3000 ($20/1,000 words for 3 books, 50k words each)<br/><strong>ISBNs</strong> = $295 for 10 (3 ISBNs per book, 1 for paperback, 1 for hardback, 1 for ebook)</p>
<p><strong>Email Marketing</strong> = $720 (I can market the trilogy the same way I market a single book)</p>
<p><strong>Social Marketing</strong> = $2400 (I can market the trilogy the same way I market a single book)</p>
<p><strong>Influencer Reviews</strong> = $3063 (for the full trilogy: $891 - OnlineBookClub, $1575 - Kirkus, $597 - ReadersFavorite)</p>
<p><strong>Total</strong> for the full trilogy = <u><strong>$13,978</strong></u></p>
<p>So, it's $14,000 for the series - but since Book 1 is already completed, and I already have the ISBNs needed for the other two books, it would actually be closer to $12,000.</p>
<p>So, why is my goal for this campaign is <u>$18,000</u>? Three things: Audible, Google Ads, Word-of-mouth. This campaign isn't just to launch this series, it's to launch my career in writing.</p>
<p>More and more readers are using platforms like Audible for their book intake. Non-readers are also stepping into the reading world with audiobooks. In some cases, if not for audiobooks, this audience would never think of opening a book. A bigger audience means more potential readers. More readers = a more successful book. </p>
<p>Along with running regular social media ads and converting my books to audiobooks, I'm also planning to run ads thru Google. This alone will broaden my marketing strategy to reaching readers through Youtube, Gmail, Google Search and more. </p>
<p>Lastly, the podcasts and the blogs. This is where word of mouth comes into play. While not all bloggers and podcasters charge for promotion, many of the top tier ones do. Much of book promotion is pay-to-play if a writer wants to get any kind of traction going. </p>
<p>So, to recap, my goal is <strong>$18,000 </strong>and includes the full production, printing and delivery the of full trilogy, converting the series to audiobooks, funding the marketing strategy needed for ads and promotion, and to getting perks to backers.</p>
<p>Speaking of perks...</p>
<h2>What you get</h2>
<p>Every backer, no matter what tier, will receive:</p>
<ul>
<li>an eBook of Syphoner: Book 1 of the trilogy</li>
<li>a social shoutout on Facebook, IG and Twitter</li>
<li>a Syphoner-themed desktop wallpaper (formatted for either desktop, phone or tablet)</li>
</ul>
<p>Other perks include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Syphoner Swag (mugs, totes, bookmarks)</li>
<li>Autographed copies (paperback and hardback)</li>
<li>Exclusive backers-only versions of the trilogy</li>
<li>A secret perk option for Ultra-fans</li>
<li>Much more (check the perks details for specifics)</li>
</ul>
<h3>What happens if I don't reach the entire goal:</h3>
<p>If I don't reach the funding goal, the funds will be applied to as many of the steps required for publishing as possible, in order by priority, as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Editing</li>
<li>Proofreading</li>
<li>ISBNs &amp; Publishing</li>
<li>Printing &amp; shipping to backers</li>
<li>Designing, purchasing and sending swag to backers</li>
<li>Marketing</li>
<li>Conversion to audiobooks</li>
<li>An official virtual launch for the series</li>
</ol>
<div>
<h2>Your Impact</h2>
<p>If you're even considering contributing to this campaign, one of two things must be true:</p>
<ol>
<li>You're a reader (in any capacity, voracious or occasional)</li>
<li>You support the arts</li>
</ol>
<p>As a supporter of the arts, your contribution will bring me that much closer to making my dreams of becoming a renowned serial novelist a reality. </p>
<p>As a reader, you're even more important, in that your support doesn't end here. When you receive The Syphoner Saga, and fall in love with these characters and their stories, you'll hunger for more of my work. You'll recommend my books to your friends and family, and other readers and groups you know. You, important soul, are the reason I write. Without someone who enjoys the art of the written word, someone who loves getting lost inside the world between the pages, I would have no reason to work as hard as I do on my stories. By supporting, you are forever a part of my journey as a writer. When I do achieve the goals I have set for myself, you are who I will look to in appreciation because it all starts here and now. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>Some potential risk might be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Issues with shipping delays due to Covid-19</li>
<li>Printing delays, also due to the coronavirus</li>
<li>Personal delays/publishing delays</li>
</ul>
<h3>Solutions</h3>
<p>My method of resolving any issues always starts with communication. </p>
<p>Obviously, I can't control the postal system, nor can I control the virus or any book printing company I work with. What I can do is keep you informed every step of the way. </p>
<p>The same goes for any personal issues that might come up throughout the duration of working through this series. </p>
<p>If any issues come up, you will receive updates here, via email (if you <a href=""https://mailchi.mp/munzielestrange/subscribe"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">subscribe to updates</a>), my social media, and my <a href=""http://munzielestrange.xyz"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">author's site</a>. If everything goes smoothly, you can expect about 5-7 updates here throughout the duration of campaign and some form of communication after at least once a month with updates until all perks have been shipped out and delivered. I'll also update you on any new projects I start (but you are free to unsubscribe at any time). </p>
<p>Aside from keeping you informed, I can only vow to work my hardest to solve any issues that may arise. I'm pretty creative, so I usually think my way out of seemingly impossible situations. </p>
</div>
<h2>So what's the story about?</h2>
<p>The Syphoner Saga is a 3-part (maybe 4-part) paranormal-horror-romance series staring protagonist Divina LeBeau. <i>Syphoner</i> is the first book of the series, followed by <i>Phoenixsoul</i> and <i>Cimmerian</i>. </p>
<p>In <strong>Syphoner</strong> we meet Divina -- a quirky, sarcastic and genuinely good-natured 17-year-old from Louisiana -- her love interest, Bastien Loukas, and their crazily intertwined families. We also meet Satrina, in a very odd and suspicious way...her funeral. I won't spoil it for you, but through the course of untimely ""shifter"" puberty (a thing entirely different from it's human counterpart), Divina discovers the truth about her estranged and presumed-dead father who is, in fact, very much alive. And he isn't the only one alive after an alleged certain death. The thing in the mirror, the one that takes over Divina's reflection sometimes, seems to be more than just a haunting spirit. It also doesn't seem to live solely in the mirror. As stated earlier, <strong>everyone who contributes will get an ebook copy of <i>Syphoner</i>.  </strong>If you're not sure about supporting yet, check out <a href=""https://munzielestrange.xyz/previews"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">this excerpt</a> from Chapter 3 of the book and see if your interest is piqued. </p>
<p>I can't give away too much about <strong>Phoenixsoul</strong> and <strong>Cimmerian</strong>, but I will say Divina's biggest fears and wildest dreams come to fruition and she must fight against the darkest parts of herself or risk losing everything that truly matters to her. </p>
<p>Book 2, <strong>Phoenixsoul</strong>, delves more into the truth about the ""family curse"" the LeBeau family believes they're under and the history of Divina and her mother Farrah's heritage. </p>
<p>Divina's is a story filled with dark magic, beautiful and powerful beasts, and unforgettable characters. From dragon-shifters (Draaks) to the mysterious - but auspicious - magic wielding Druids. </p>

Total: a minimum of $5915 [or $6399 including reviews)
Also, keep in mind the following:

I'm a digital content creator, so I make my own book covers. 
I do all my own formatting
I do all my own publicity and marketing (book launches, appearances, event scheduling)
If I added the costs of the last 3 bullet points, it could add as much as $5000 to the total

The total for 3 books breaks down like this:

Lastly, the podcasts and the blogs. This is where word of mouth comes into play. While not all bloggers and podcasters charge for promotion, many of the top tier ones do. Much of book promotion is pay-to-play if a writer wants to get any kind of traction going. 
So, to recap, my goal is $18,000 and includes the full production, printing and delivery the of full trilogy, converting the series to audiobooks, funding the marketing strategy needed for ads and promotion, and to getting perks to backers.
Speaking of perks...
What you get
Every backer, no matter what tier, will receive:

an eBook of Syphoner: Book 1 of the trilogy
a social shoutout on Facebook, IG and Twitter
a Syphoner-themed desktop wallpaper (formatted for either desktop, phone or tablet)

Other perks include:

Syphoner Swag (mugs, totes, bookmarks)
Autographed copies (paperback and hardback)
Exclusive backers-only versions of the trilogy
A secret perk option for Ultra-fans
Much more (check the perks details for specifics)

What happens if I don't reach the entire goal:
If I don't reach the funding goal, the funds will be applied to as many of the steps required for publishing as possible, in order by priority, as follows:

Editing
Proofreading
ISBNs & Publishing
Printing & shipping to backers
Designing, purchasing and sending swag to backers
Marketing
Conversion to audiobooks
An official virtual launch for the series


Your Impact
If you're even considering contributing to this campaign, one of two things must be true:

You're a reader (in any capacity, voracious or occasional)
You support the arts

As a supporter of the arts, your contribution will bring me that much closer to making my dreams of becoming a renowned serial novelist a reality. 
As a reader, you're even more important, in that your support doesn't end here. When you receive The Syphoner Saga, and fall in love with these characters and their stories, you'll hunger for more of my work. You'll recommend my books to your friends and family, and other readers and groups you know. You, important soul, are the reason I write. Without someone who enjoys the art of the written word, someone who loves getting lost inside the world between the pages, I would have no reason to work as hard as I do on my stories. By supporting, you are forever a part of my journey as a writer. When I do achieve the goals I have set for myself, you are who I will look to in appreciation because it all starts here and now. 


Risks & Challenges
Some potential risk might be:

Issues with shipping delays due to Covid-19
Printing delays, also due to the coronavirus
Personal delays/publishing delays

Solutions
My method of resolving any issues always starts with communication. 
Obviously, I can't control the postal system, nor can I control the virus or any book printing company I work with. What I can do is keep you informed every step of the way. 
The same goes for any personal issues that might come up throughout the duration of working through this series. 
If any issues come up, you will receive updates here, via email (if you subscribe to updates), my social media, and my author's site. If everything goes smoothly, you can expect about 5-7 updates here throughout the duration of campaign and some form of communication after at least once a month with updates until all perks have been shipped out and delivered. I'll also update you on any new projects I start (but you are free to unsubscribe at any time). 
Aside from keeping you informed, I can only vow to work my hardest to solve any issues that may arise. I'm pretty creative, so I usually think my way out of seemingly impossible situations. 

So what's the story about?
The Syphoner Saga is a 3-part (maybe 4-part) paranormal-horror-romance series staring protagonist Divina LeBeau. Syphoner is the first book of the series, followed by Phoenixsoul and Cimmerian. 
In Syphoner we meet Divina -- a quirky, sarcastic and genuinely good-natured 17-year-old from Louisiana -- her love interest, Bastien Loukas, and their crazily intertwined families. We also meet Satrina, in a very odd and suspicious way...her funeral. I won't spoil it for you, but through the course of untimely ""shifter"" puberty (a thing entirely different from it's human counterpart), Divina discovers the truth about her estranged and presumed-dead father who is, in fact, very much alive. And he isn't the only one alive after an alleged certain death. The thing in the mirror, the one that takes over Divina's reflection sometimes, seems to be more than just a haunting spirit. It also doesn't seem to live solely in the mirror. As stated earlier, everyone who contributes will get an ebook copy of Syphoner.  If you're not sure about supporting yet, check out this excerpt from Chapter 3 of the book and see if your interest is piqued. 
I can't give away too much about Phoenixsoul and Cimmerian, but I will say Divina's biggest fears and wildest dreams come to fruition and she must fight against the darkest parts of herself or risk losing everything that truly matters to her. 
Book 2, Phoenixsoul, delves more into the truth about the ""family curse"" the LeBeau family believes they're under and the history of Divina and her mother Farrah's heritage. 
Divina's is a story filled with dark magic, beautiful and powerful beasts, and unforgettable characters. From dragon-shifters (Draaks) to the mysterious - but auspicious - magic wielding Druids.

I’m Professor Neka</h2><p>After six years of teaching Political Science and African African Studies and serving as an elections official in both South Carolina and Michigan, one thing is clear to me: <strong>it’s time to transform political education in America. </strong></p><p>Too many Americans of all ages, races, religions, and backgrounds are uninformed about our government’s history and functions. It is this ignorance that creates the space for conspiracy theories to take hold. Democracy works because citizens hold elected officials accountable. But when citizens lack a basic understanding of how the government is supposed to function, they can be easily manipulated as political corruption grows, and the entire system eventually falls apart. </p><p>The question is, if political education is this important, then WHY haven’t we been prioritizing it in America’s public school system? Is this just another tragic consequence of failing public schools or can more sinister motives be traced back to the elites of decades passed? Read my book, <i>The Political Miseducation of America</i>, to find out! </p><p> </p><h2>About the Book</h2><p>I left my teaching position in 2019 with the goal of finding a way to fix political education. I started by creating an organization called Citizenship 101 to aid with my mission. Then I decided to take the Introduction to American Government course that I had been teaching out of the classroom and share it with the world. </p><p>As I converted each section of my teaching notes into a coherent narrative for my new blog, I watched, just like all of you, as the presidential election left more destruction in its wake than a slow moving train wreck. It was as hostile and divisive as I’ve ever seen America. (Keep in mind that I wasn’t alive in the 1960s.) When I saw the deluge of conspiracy theories that followed, I realized that I needed to do more than just create a blog.</p><p>The blog I was working on was a simple collection of 10 long essays on various aspects of American governance. Essentially, they were chapters in an unpublished book. They were full of valuable information, but with no links or illustrations, they didn’t attract much attention online. What I needed to do was compile these sections into an actual book for wider distribution and include a way to alert people to the truth behind the collective ignorance of the American people. In other words, I needed to become <b>the modern-day Paul Revere of political education. </b></p><p>During my years of teaching, I taught African American Studies as well as Political Science. One of my favorite books to assign in those classes was Carter G. Woodson’s 1933 classic <i>The Miseducation of the Negro</i>. He is remembered as the “Father of Black History Month” because he identified a failure in the American educational system, and he decided to do something about it. He saw that students were not being educated about black history, so he created a way to teach that history outside of the classroom. He used his book as a way to alert people to the problem and rally them around his unique solution. It is that model that I wish to follow. </p><p> </p><p><strong><i>The Political Miseducation of America</i> is divided in 3 parts:</strong></p><p><strong>Part 1 </strong>is called <strong>Ignorance is Not Bliss</strong> and contains <strong>chapters 1-6</strong>. It examines the statistics surrounding the political knowledge of average Americans and recounts the surprising history of civic education in America. It also explains my proposal for transforming modern political education. </p><p>1. The Seat of the Trouble</p><p>2. Political Education Neglected</p><p>3. How We Drifted Away from the Truth</p><p>4.

You may not be able to pre-order the book right now, but you can still plan to purchase it in the future—either for yourself or as gifts for your family and friends. My personal pro tip would be to use the book to spark some inter-generational dialogue between your teenagers and their grandparents. Society could use a lot more of that these days.
If you or someone you know has technical expertise in either publishing or website design, I would welcome an in-kind donation of time and services. Please contact me directly at professorneka@citizenship101.info to discuss the specific services that you are able to provide. 
I appreciate all of the support that my early supporters are providing, but I need to make it clear that this project is about much more than a paycheck for me. Political education has been my lifelong passion, and I sincerely believe that it offers solutions to many of our nation’s current problems. Unfortunately, electing a new President will not be enough to fix the mess that America is in. Change will not come from the top down. It must come from the bottom up. We, as Americans, must take responsibility for educating ourselves and make a collective decision to head in a different direction.   Thank You in Advance for Your Support! Roneka Matheny, “Professor Neka”Author, The Political Miseducation of AmericaFounder, Citizenship 101",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><i>The Absolutely Amazing Adventures of the League of Ordinary Old Dogs</i>
is a children’s chapter book that introduces us to a top secret group of old
dogs who go on covert missions to rescue other old dogs who are in trouble. It
is intended for readers aged 8+.</p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>WHO ARE YOU?</b></p>
<p>I am Erik. Hope (my wife) and I have
been running Little Old Dog Sanctuary, a hospice for old dogs, for many years.
We run it out of our home located on four acres in the Colorado Rocky
Mountains. The dogs get care 24/7 and we tend to their every need.</p>
<p>We only take in animals from
county shelters. Older dogs have little to no chance of being adopted from a
county shelter, and county shelters aren’t equipped to deal with any medical
needs they may have. Since we’re a hospice, we can. So we do.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>WHY IS THIS BOOK NECESSARY?</b></p>
<p>We are always at full capacity. Every
single day we have to turn away dogs that are perfectly healthy who are going
to be euthanized because they committed the crime of being old. We could easily
have 500 dogs at the Sanctuary within a week and even more the week after that.
We are doing as much as we can, and it’s not nearly enough. There is an
overwhelming need for saving old dogs who have plenty of life and love to
share.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, at shelters, eight
to ten years of age is officially considered “old” in dogs. Several breeds,
like Chihuahuas and terriers, live to be an average of 16-18. Norman, a terrier
mix of ours from years ago, lived to be 23. Unless they come to the shelter
with their vet records, which some do, nobody really knows how old they are. If
you look old, you’re old. And you’re the first to be put down. It’s a raw deal.</p>
<p>Since we can’t personally save
all of them, community outreach has become an important part of our mission. We
blog and write articles about solutions to old dog issues on various social
media and by simply talking to people we meet. But there is one demographic
that we aren’t reaching with those avenues. And it’s probably the most
important group for us to communicate with. It’s the demographic that has the
most power to change the future.</p>
<p>Children. </p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>WHAT IS IT ABOUT?</b></p>
<p>It’s about 150 pages and 25,000
words.</p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>NO, REALLY, WHAT’S THIS ALL
ABOUT?</b></p>
<p>Essentially, the book is an
awesome tool for us to use to help save old dogs by influencing children about what
“old” really means, as well as teaching the lessons of friendship, loyalty,
commitment, teamwork and social consciousness. It also promotes literacy.</p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>WHAT’S THE <i>BOOK</i> ABOUT?</b></p>
<p><i>The Absolutely Amazing Adventures of The League of Ordinary Old Dogs</i>
is the story of a mysterious society of like-minded old dogs whose only mission
is to rescue other old dogs who are in danger.  They work in secret, usually under the cover
of night, operating from the basement of the home of Jane Newcomb. Jane is a
fiercely independent 103-year-old semi-retired librarian. Jane believes that
she “just has a few dogs in the house.” She is wrong.</p>
<p>Because she isn’t able to
navigate stairs, Jane hasn’t been down to her basement for decades. If she were
to go down to the basement, she’d be shocked. Instead of spider webs and dust
bunnies, the basement is an active command station, full of computers and gadgets.
It’s also the epicenter of a network of tunnels beneath the city that allow the
dogs to have stealthy access to nearly anywhere they need to go. They even have
a car (of sorts) that uses toenail clippings for fuel.</p>
<p>The League of Ordinary Old Dogs has
hundreds of members and is run by The Council, consisting of Sampson, Walter and Stanley. They are the “oldest of the old.” They are very wise and also very
insane. They have seniority, so they call the shots…when they are awake. But
they don’t do any actual rescues or any of the dirty work. Instead, they send
H.E.L.P., the Heroic Escape and Liberation Platoon. HELP is a rotating squad of
previously rescued dogs, each with a unique skill set. Davy is the “tech” guy.
Hamlet has the strategic mind of MacGyver. Pinky is the muscle. Claude is a
hoarder, and he’s the “go to” guy for all sorts of “stuff.” Leo is the
inventor. Ilsa thinks she is a master of disguise, but no matter what she does to
change her appearance, everyone just points at her and says “Oh, look! A pug!” and
they squish her face and kiss her. Wilkie and Estelle are so much in love that
they have become conjoined. Peanut is the doctor. Chester Von Wee Wee is the
lookout, and he’s a little high-strung. Penelope is psychic (or at least says
she is). Clementine spends half her time rolling around like a tumbleweed. And,
of course, there is a snarky and sarcastic cat named Spring.</p>
<p>To make money to run the
organization, the dogs have a very successful earthworm farm (The Worms R Us Worm
Farm) and they sell the worms to people over the internet. They are able to do
everything online, from purchasing supplies to marketing to shipping, so nobody
knows that the business is actually run by dogs. According to their website,
the worm farm is owned and operated by Larry Lobo – his biography on the web
site indicating that he is a retired schoolteacher from Waukegan turned Professional
Worm Whelper. And there is a picture of Larry on every carton of worms. But
it’s really just a photo of Champ, an already strange looking spaniel/terrier
mix, wearing an Albert Einstein wig and sunglasses. And the photo was taken as Champ was sneaking a mouthful of earthworms.
The worm part wasn’t supposed to be a part of the photo. Sadly, it just
happened. But happily, somehow, the photo became an internet sensation. Champ
is known as “Einstein Worm Dog” and business is booming. College students all
over the country are wearing t-shirts sporting Champ’s image and he’s become sort
of a mystic folk hero. Nobody knows exactly why.</p>
<p>The League is fully
self-contained and self-sustaining and can operate without anyone knowing about
them. Or, at least that’s their plan. But the rescues aren’t easy and there is
plenty of drama, action and excitement.</p>
<p>Oh. And the dogs constantly
battle an evil squirrel who wants to steal the toenail fuel recipe and take
over the world. So that's a problem.</p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>WHO ARE THESE DOGS?</b></p>
<p>They are our dogs. You can see
our dogs, past and present, on our website. And on Facebook. And Instagram.
They are omnipotent…</p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>WHERE IS THE PROJECT NOW?</b></p>
<p>I have the characters. I have the
story. Now I need backer participation to finish the story and money to get it proofed,
have an awesome cover created (with the input of the backers, see below) and print it all up so I can get it out there.</p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>PERKS!</b></p>
<p>It makes me feel good that our
dogs are characters in the book. And you should feel good, too. So this is what
I’m gonna’ do…</p>
<p>As a backer, you will have the
opportunity to</p>
<p>- Get a sticker with the cover art</p>
<p>- Donate a book to a school or
organization</p>
<p>- Choose a name for a street
sign, museum, flower shop, etc. (remember that this is a children’s book!)</p>
<p>- Have your dog be a Hero</p>
<p>- Have your dog be a Villain</p>
<p>- Promote your business</p><p>- Plus many other options!</p><p>You will see that stickers are included in pretty much every perk and that the stickers are the cover art. The t-shirt is also the cover art. See below...</p><p><br/></p><p><b>SO WHAT'S UP WITH THE COVER ART?</b></p><p>The cover art has not been designed. Yet. You may ask, ""Why not? It's the first impression. First impressions, with books at least, are extremely important."" I totally agree. But they are only important if the book comes to life. No book = No cover. So, as a backer at ANY level, you will help select the cover. I will be holding four votes (three during the campaign and one after the campaign) to determine the parameters of what the cover will look like. Choose wisely.

<p></p>
<p>Ezzel a könyvvel egy pótolhatatlan összegzést tarthat kezében az olvasó. Ugyanis a Klotildligettel kapcsolatos kordokumentumok, iratok, tervek, lejegyzések a második világháború során mind elpusztultak. Ezzel Klotildliget, amely a maga korának egyik legcsodálatosabb elgondolása volt, egy csapásra fehér folt lett a művészettörténet és a történettudomány számára. Soha senki nem tartotta lehetségesnek feltérképezni múltját. Egészen mostanáig.</p>
<p>A szerző, Vörös Ildikó művészettörténész és esztéta a Pázmány Péter Katolikus Egyetemen végzett 2005-ben. Művészettörténet szakon leadott diplomamunkája képezi a Klotildliget című könyv alapját. A későbbi évek során bővítményekkel és gazdag képanyaggal egészítette ki munkáját, amely végül tökéletes részletességgel mutatja be ennek a paradicsomi miliőjű villaparknak létrejöttét, mindennapjait és átalakulását a századfordulótól napjainkig. A szerző – saját bevallása szerint – nem korokra, hanem mások által feltárhatatlannak tartott történelmi és művészettörténeti témákra szakosodott. Ennek a lehetetlennek tartott munkának az eredménye ez az album, amely annyira impozánsra sikeredett, hogy az olvasó számára Klotildliget történetének minden perce és lakóinak teljes élete megelevenedik a lapokon. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Miközben történeti és művészettörténeti áttekintést kapunk Klotildligetről, betekintést nyerünk a kor társadalmi életébe és a villák lakóinak mindennapjaiba, eredeti visszaemlékezések alapján. A könyvet számos korabeli képeslap és dokumentum gazdag illusztrációja teszi még izgalmasabbá. Isten hozta Klotildligeten! Lépjen be a csodás, századfordolós villanegyedbe!</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Kedvezményes előrendelési lehetőség (perkek):</b></p>
<p>Az album kiskereskedelmi fogyasztói ára várhatóan 5.600 HUF lesz. A megjelenés előtt közösségi finanszírozás keretében előrendelhető a könyv. Ez segíti a mihamarabbi megjelenést, lehetőség, hogy kedvezményes áron szerezzék meg az albumot, nevük megjelenjen a támogatók között és akár egyedi ajándékokhoz is juthatnak, mint pl. képeslap és naptár. A csomagok korlátozott számban állnak rendelkezésre. Választani a jobb oldalon megjelenő csomagajánlatok (perk) közül lehet.</p>

<h3>Klotildligetről</h3>
<p>A XIX-XX. század fordulóján Magyarország egész területén folytak építkezések, amelynek produktumai méltán nevezhetők szimbólumértékű emlékeknek. A módos arisztokraták és a gazdagabb polgárság hatalmas épületeikkel, kastélyaikkal, kúriáikkal, villáikkal, emlékhelyeikkel nemcsak a kor elismerését akarták kivívni, de az utódaikra hagyott alkotásokkal saját, átvitt értelemben vett, halhatatlanságukat is biztosítani akarták. Ez az ellentmondásokra épülő kor a béke és a fejlődés röpke időszaka volt. Akkor még nem tudhatták, illetve kevesen sejthették, hogy ez a boldogság már a háború előszele, a tragédiát jelző “vihar előtti csend” volt. Úgy tartják, aki meg akarja ismerni a magyar történelmet, elég, ha kastélyaink és villáink sorsát követi nyomon. Ez különösen igaz Klotildligetre, amely a történelem ilyetén alakulásának tükörképévé vált.</p>
<p>A boldog békeidők társadalmának életét körvonalazza a villatelep megvalósítása. A meginduló vasútépítés kapukat nyitott a fővároshoz közeli erdők beépítésére, így a pilisi táj egyik gyönyörű domboldalát József főherceg tervei alapján felparcellázták és jó pénzért eladták, hogy a pompás utcák mentén a későbbi lakók csinos, kis villákat emeljenek. Klotildliget helyszínrajza jól mutatja, milyen nagy precizitással tervezték meg az utcák vonalát, és osztották fel a lankás, néhol meredek területet.

Ezzel a könyvvel egy pótolhatatlan összegzést tarthat kezében az olvasó. Ugyanis a Klotildligettel kapcsolatos kordokumentumok, iratok, tervek, lejegyzések a második világháború során mind elpusztultak. Ezzel Klotildliget, amely a maga korának egyik legcsodálatosabb elgondolása volt, egy csapásra fehér folt lett a művészettörténet és a történettudomány számára. Soha senki nem tartotta lehetségesnek feltérképezni múltját. Egészen mostanáig.
A szerző, Vörös Ildikó művészettörténész és esztéta a Pázmány Péter Katolikus Egyetemen végzett 2005-ben. Művészettörténet szakon leadott diplomamunkája képezi a Klotildliget című könyv alapját. A későbbi évek során bővítményekkel és gazdag képanyaggal egészítette ki munkáját, amely végül tökéletes részletességgel mutatja be ennek a paradicsomi miliőjű villaparknak létrejöttét, mindennapjait és átalakulását a századfordulótól napjainkig. A szerző – saját bevallása szerint – nem korokra, hanem mások által feltárhatatlannak tartott történelmi és művészettörténeti témákra szakosodott. Ennek a lehetetlennek tartott munkának az eredménye ez az album, amely annyira impozánsra sikeredett, hogy az olvasó számára Klotildliget történetének minden perce és lakóinak teljes élete megelevenedik a lapokon. Miközben történeti és művészettörténeti áttekintést kapunk Klotildligetről, betekintést nyerünk a kor társadalmi életébe és a villák lakóinak mindennapjaiba, eredeti visszaemlékezések alapján. A könyvet számos korabeli képeslap és dokumentum gazdag illusztrációja teszi még izgalmasabbá. Isten hozta Klotildligeten! Lépjen be a csodás, századfordolós villanegyedbe!

Kedvezményes előrendelési lehetőség (perkek):
Az album kiskereskedelmi fogyasztói ára várhatóan 5.600 HUF lesz. A megjelenés előtt közösségi finanszírozás keretében előrendelhető a könyv. Ez segíti a mihamarabbi megjelenést, lehetőség, hogy kedvezményes áron szerezzék meg az albumot, nevük megjelenjen a támogatók között és akár egyedi ajándékokhoz is juthatnak, mint pl. képeslap és naptár. A csomagok korlátozott számban állnak rendelkezésre. Választani a jobb oldalon megjelenő csomagajánlatok (perk) közül lehet.

Klotildligetről
A XIX-XX. század fordulóján Magyarország egész területén folytak építkezések, amelynek produktumai méltán nevezhetők szimbólumértékű emlékeknek. A módos arisztokraták és a gazdagabb polgárság hatalmas épületeikkel, kastélyaikkal, kúriáikkal, villáikkal, emlékhelyeikkel nemcsak a kor elismerését akarták kivívni, de az utódaikra hagyott alkotásokkal saját, átvitt értelemben vett, halhatatlanságukat is biztosítani akarták. Ez az ellentmondásokra épülő kor a béke és a fejlődés röpke időszaka volt. Akkor még nem tudhatták, illetve kevesen sejthették, hogy ez a boldogság már a háború előszele, a tragédiát jelző “vihar előtti csend” volt. Úgy tartják, aki meg akarja ismerni a magyar történelmet, elég, ha kastélyaink és villáink sorsát követi nyomon. Ez különösen igaz Klotildligetre, amely a történelem ilyetén alakulásának tükörképévé vált.
A boldog békeidők társadalmának életét körvonalazza a villatelep megvalósítása. A meginduló vasútépítés kapukat nyitott a fővároshoz közeli erdők beépítésére, így a pilisi táj egyik gyönyörű domboldalát József főherceg tervei alapján felparcellázták és jó pénzért eladták, hogy a pompás utcák mentén a későbbi lakók csinos, kis villákat emeljenek. Klotildliget helyszínrajza jól mutatja, milyen nagy precizitással tervezték meg az utcák vonalát, és osztották fel a lankás, néhol meredek területet. Közvetlen ezután, a mesés botanikai kertekkel rendelkező birtokairól hires főherceg elrendelte az utcák fásítását. Ennek eredményeképpen máig egyedülálló utcaképek jöttek létre. Az utak portalanításáról is gondoskodtak, s makadámos burkolatot építettek, szélüket faragott fakockákkal szegélyezték.
A telektulajdonosoknak kikötötték, hogy villáikat az utcafronttól minimum hat méter távolságban epíthetik fel, így az épületek és kerítések között újabb kerteket alakítottak ki. Néhány helyütt, ahol a terepviszonyok megkívánták, magas támfalakat emeltek, amelyeket díszes kovácsoltvas kapu tett még fenségesebbé. Az egész környék maga volt a paradicsomi nyugalom. Klotildliget kávéházakkal, hangulatos vendéglőkkel, öt uszodával és ugyanennyi teniszpályával is rendelkezett. “A villa előtti verandán szólt a grámofon, így aki nem teniszezett, táncolhatott vagy az asztaloknál beszélgethetett. Fiatalok és idősebbek egyaránt kedvelték ezeket az összejöveteleket, ahol nagyszerű társaság gyűlt egybe.” – emlékezett vissza Nagybaczoni Nagy Vilma gyermekkora emlékeire.

<p>La Idea surge bajo la necesidad de generar un proyecto gráfico que 
cumpliera con los altos estándares de calidad del mercado actual, pero 
 no solo en el medio gráfico si no también en su contenido como materia 
de investigación. En el proceso pase por diversos retos como fue el ser 
un joven con pocos conocimientos del inicio del genero musical que mas 
escuchaba, mi experiencia mas cercana con la historia era los cuentos de
 compañeros y lo poco que podía leer en esos momentos en blog y paginas 
de noticias del rock nacional. </p>
<p>Cuando me toca generar un tema para la Tesis (Trabajo de Grado), 
logro identificar el camino al cual quería llegar (Algo que pudiera 
recopilar la evolución del rock venezolano gráficamente) pero el mayor 
inconveniente era centrar las ideas y hacerlas factibles ya que no era 
solo pensar la idea sino verla, tomarla, digerirla y bajarla al producto
 final. </p>
<p>El proceso de selección del nombre que daría inicio al proyecto nace 
del mutuo entendimiento entre mi tutora Shaindel Arana y mi persona 
enfocado en los temas que yo podía manejar y las áreas donde mas me 
desvolviese en el transcurso de estudio de la carrera, pasando casi 2 
meses de propuestas y propuestas frecuentemente rechazadas por clichés 
se logra llegar a un tema que rompería con lo tradicional hecho para 
dicha escuela ""ANÁLISIS DE LAS ESTRUCTURAS DE DIAGRAMACIÓN APLICADAS AL 
DISEÑO GRÁFICO DEL EMPAQUE MÚSICAL DEL GÉNERO ROCK DESDE EL AÑO 1950 
HASTA 2014 EN VENEZUELA"" un tema algo complejo y difícil de comprender 
en primer instante, su idea o función estaba basada en generar una 
investigación que pudiera generar y presentar la evolución del diseño 
gráfico ejercido sobre las portadas de los álbumes musicales del genero 
rock &amp; pop en Venezuela, pero esto basado en un periodo de tiempo 
que era desde sus inicios hasta la actualidad que en dicho  momento era 
el año 2014 que fue el año se entrego el proyecto. </p>
<p>El primer choque con la realidad que tuve que manejar fue el darme 
cuenta que desde la década de los 50 hasta los 80 era casi inexistente 
el material en la web, sitio que para estos años uno suele frecuentar en
 la búsqueda y principios de cualquier investigación recordándome 
aquella frase ""Si no esta en internet, no existe"" . Prácticamente el 
rock venezolano no existía o por lo menos no de manera sencilla en 
Internet, lo poco que había en la red eran blog desactualizados del 
genero que cubrían mas que todo del 90 en adelante. Haber presentado una
 propuesta con una fecha tan extensa de investigación era un reto, 
abarcaba la totalidad de historia de un genero desde su surgimiento 
hasta su presente. Mientras mas buscaba me daba cuenta que estaba metido
 en un tremendo vació informativo y que la mejor solución era buscar los
 textos escritos, para ese entonces solo tuve conocimiento de libros de 
mucho contenido  textual y menos gráfico, es ahí donde consigo el 
enfoque final y la meta de dicho proyecto. </p>

<p>El
 primer contacto directo que logro tener con el mundo histórico del rock
 venezolano surge 5 meses después de presentado el tema y estar aprobado
 para trabajarlo, este surge en La hacienda la trinidad con la 
presentación de ""La Discoteca"" una exposición con
 mas de 400 Discos, anécdotas, colección de libros, empaques y demás 
contenido que tenia que ver con el tema del rock en Venezuela. Dicha 
exposición estaba distribuida y totalmente organizada por fecha 
cronológica mediante un pasea a través de salas. Esta fue la principal 
fuente de información para recopilar las primeras gráficas del rock 
venezolano. Ese mismo día se presento una persona que apoyaría el 
proyecto y seria la segunda persona capaz de prestar su conocimiento 
para ampliar la investigación Eddio Piña con su proyecto editorial La 
Historia del Rock en Venezuela.</p>
<p>El proceso de diseño fue complicado, la optencion de las caratulas 
era mas que todo atraves de fotografias tomadas a los propios albumes 
que luego pasaban a un proceso de edicion, restauracion y motaje. Los 
discos de esta epoca son dificiles de conseguir en un estado excelente 
debido a que en esos tiempo los dueños los marcaban y firmaban a modo de
 proteger su coleccion.</p>

The
 idea came on the need to generate a graphic project that meets the high
 standards of today's market, but not only in the graphic medium but 
also in content and research. In
 the process go through various challenges as it was being a young man 
with little knowledge of the beginning of the musical genre that more 
listening, my closest experience with tales story was and how little 
fellow could read in those moments and blog pages News of rock.When
 I have to create a theme for the thesis (Degree Work), managed to 
identify the way which wanted to get (something that could gather the 
evolution of the Venezuelan rock graphically) but the biggest drawback 
was to focus the ideas and make them feasible as it was not but just think of the idea see it, take it, digest it and lower it to the final product.
The
 name selection process that would initiate the project was born of 
mutual understanding between Shaindel Arana my tutor and myself focused 
on the issues that I could handle and more areas where I desvolviese 
study during the race, going almost 2 months
 of proposals and proposals are often rejected by clichés makes it to a 
topic that would break with tradition made for this school ""ANALYSIS OF 
STRUCTURES APPLIED GRAPHIC DESIGN GRAPHIC PACKAGING MUSICAL GENRE ROCK 
FROM 1950 TO 2014 IN VENEZUELA"" a
 rather complex and difficult to understand at first instant issue, your
 idea or feature was based on generating research that could generate 
and present the evolution of graphic design exerted on the covers of 
music albums of the genre rock & pop in Venezuela, but this based on a time period that was from its beginnings to the present 
which at that time was that 2014 was the year the project was delivered.The
 first clash with the reality that I had to handle was the realization 
that from the 50s to the 80s was almost non-existent material on the web
 site for one frequents the years in finding and principles of any 
investigation reminding the phrase ""If you are not online, does not exist"". Venezuelan
 rock practically non-existent or at least not easily on the Internet, 
what little there was in network were outdated the genus blog covering 
most of all 90 onwards. Have
 submitted a proposal with such extensive research date was a challenge,
 covering all history of a genre from its inception to the present. The
 more searching I realized that he was involved in a terrible emptiness 
informative and that the best solution was to seek written texts, by 
then I had only knowledge of books much textual content and less 
graphic, that's where I get the final approach and Goal of the project.

(La Discoteca - Vicente Corostola)

The
 first contact that achievement have the historical world of Venezuelan 
rock comes five months after the presentation of the theme and be 
approved to work it, this comes at Hacienda Trinity with the 
presentation of ""The Disco"" an exhibition of more than 400 discs , anecdotes, book collection, packaging, and other content that had to do with the subject of rock in Venezuela. This exhibition was distributed and fully organized by chronological date by a stroll through rooms. This was the main source of information to compile the first graphic Venezuelan rock. That day is someone who support the draft and would be the second 
person can lend their knowledge to expand research Eddio pineapple with 
his publishing project The History of Rock in Venezuela present.The
 design process was complicated, the optencion of the covers was most of
 all photographs taken THROUGH albums they then passed to a process of 
editing, restoration and motaje. The
 discs of this period are difficult to obtain in an excellent state 
because in those times the owners marked and signed by way of protecting
 its collection.




 

Little by little it was getting a lot more information and started to flesh out what the design and material of the book, making possible to make a nice tour while reading discs with their anecdotes were located (obtained often the artists themselves) and curiosities about this album.



This research counted in his time with the research content of 890 albums from 1958 to 2014, currently the repertoire until 2015 will by 1400 music albums between LP and EP, reference information, biographies and anecdotes multiple bands themselves. The book was developed with a start in the genre surgimiendo rock and roll, then he runs like that genre and flows to Latin America, reaching what is Venezuela. Showing the history of what took place in those times as it was moving both the country and its musical culture.

HASTA 2014 EN VENEZUELA"" un tema algo complejo y difícil de comprender 
en primer instante, su idea o función estaba basada en generar una 
investigación que pudiera generar y presentar la evolución del diseño 
gráfico ejercido sobre las portadas de los álbumes musicales del genero 
rock & pop en Venezuela, pero esto basado en un periodo de tiempo 
que era desde sus inicios hasta la actualidad que en dicho  momento era 
el año 2014 que fue el año se entrego el proyecto. 
El primer choque con la realidad que tuve que manejar fue el darme 
cuenta que desde la década de los 50 hasta los 80 era casi inexistente 
el material en la web, sitio que para estos años uno suele frecuentar en
 la búsqueda y principios de cualquier investigación recordándome 
aquella frase ""Si no esta en internet, no existe"" . Prácticamente el 
rock venezolano no existía o por lo menos no de manera sencilla en 
Internet, lo poco que había en la red eran blog desactualizados del 
genero que cubrían mas que todo del 90 en adelante. Haber presentado una
 propuesta con una fecha tan extensa de investigación era un reto, 
abarcaba la totalidad de historia de un genero desde su surgimiento 
hasta su presente. Mientras mas buscaba me daba cuenta que estaba metido
 en un tremendo vació informativo y que la mejor solución era buscar los
 textos escritos, para ese entonces solo tuve conocimiento de libros de 
mucho contenido  textual y menos gráfico, es ahí donde consigo el 
enfoque final y la meta de dicho proyecto. 

(La Discoteca - Vicente Corostola)
El
 primer contacto directo que logro tener con el mundo histórico del rock
 venezolano surge 5 meses después de presentado el tema y estar aprobado
 para trabajarlo, este surge en La hacienda la trinidad con la 
presentación de ""La Discoteca"" una exposición con
 mas de 400 Discos, anécdotas, colección de libros, empaques y demás 
contenido que tenia que ver con el tema del rock en Venezuela. Dicha 
exposición estaba distribuida y totalmente organizada por fecha 
cronológica mediante un pasea a través de salas. Esta fue la principal 
fuente de información para recopilar las primeras gráficas del rock 
venezolano. Ese mismo día se presento una persona que apoyaría el 
proyecto y seria la segunda persona capaz de prestar su conocimiento 
para ampliar la investigación Eddio Piña con su proyecto editorial La 
Historia del Rock en Venezuela.
El proceso de diseño fue complicado, la optencion de las caratulas 
era mas que todo atraves de fotografias tomadas a los propios albumes 
que luego pasaban a un proceso de edicion, restauracion y motaje. Los 
discos de esta epoca son dificiles de conseguir en un estado excelente 
debido a que en esos tiempo los dueños los marcaban y firmaban a modo de
 proteger su coleccion.

Poco a poco se fue obteniendo muchas mas informacion y se empezo a 
darle cuerpo a lo que es el diseño y material del libro, logrando que 
fuera posible hacer un recorrido agradable durante su lectura, se 
ubicaron los discos con sus respectivas anecdotas (Sacadas muchas veces 
de los mismos artistas) y curiosidades sobre dicho album.

Dicha
 investigacion en su tiempo conto con el contenido investigativo de 890 
Albumes desde 1958 hasta el 2014, actualmente el repertorio hasta el año
 2015 va por 1400 albumes musicales entre LP y EP, informacion de 
referencia, multiples biografias y anecdotas de las propias bandas. 
El
 libro se desarrolla con un inicio en el surgimiendo el genero rock and 
roll, luego como ese genero corre y  fluye por latinoamerica, llegando a
 lo que es Venezuela. Mostrando la historia de lo que se vivio en esas 
epocas y como fue avanzando tanto el pais como su cultura musical.

What I need?: When this project began my idea and dream was not left alone as a work more, but all that research somehow got into the hands of various individuals and the public from around the country and the world, my first goal and is now It maintains, is to show that did and does in the music in the country and not only that but also the level of graphic quality which has worked on this continent in this little passion-filled place called Venezuela. Currently, for various reasons printing and publishing in the country is almost impossible to arrive at costs almost $ 9000 low amounts of 1000, 750 or 500 units, this amount ranging from $ 8256-9000. To solve this problem is looking to go to financing outside the country such as Colombia whose rate is on the order of $ 5,000 including ground shipping.

Necesidades: 
Cuando comenzó este proyecto mi idea y sueño fue que no quedara 
solo como un trabajo mas, sino que toda esa investigación de alguna 
forma llegara a manos de diversas personas y publico de distintas partes
 del país y el mundo, mi meta principal y que hoy se mantiene, es 
mostrarle que se hizo y hace en el medio musical en el país y no solo 
eso si no también el nivel de calidad gráfico con el cual se ha 
trabajado en esta parte del continente en este pequeño lugar lleno de 
pasión llamado Venezuela.
Actualmente
 por diversos motivos la impresión y publicación en el país es casi 
imposible llegando a unos costos casi de 9000$ bajo cantidades de 1000, 
750 o 500 unidades, dicho monto variando de 8256 a 9000$. Para solventar
 esta problemática se busco ir a financiamientos fuera del país como lo 
son Colombia cuya tasa va por el orden de los 5000$ incluyendo envió por
 tierra.

	modo de pensar.

<h4> No matter how much I try, no time, no video clip would be enough to squeeze all the magnitude of the mystery and the incredible beauty of emotions I experienced about 13 years ago. No time will be enough to tell you about 8 years of work on the book in which I have concealed a mystery ... Its the very beginning. The beginning of the mystery that could change everything. I believe that one dream, one incredible will, one incredibly strong feeling of a single person is able to change the world completely. Either destroy it once and for all, or save it and make it the most beautiful thing that can occur to a human mind, a place where everyone is happy regardless of what’s inside of one. This book, the first of three parts, tells about the mystery, which you've never heard of but which does exist in the real world. It is going to sweep over like a tsunami - hitting each and everyone - and there is no one to stop it. It shall spare no one and shall make all tremble at it’s might ...</h4>

<h3>The best and the most interesting story is always built around a mystery ... <br/>
</h3>
<h4>The greater a mystery is, the less people know about it and the later it is revealed. Lines of many supposedly fictional stories hold the truth ... For this reason they decide themselves when they are destined to be born and surprise the whole world… for the greatest of them will be told in the end, to change everything.</h4>
<h4>
<br/>It is time for you to open the door. The door which has these words written on it ... Abandon everything you knew, ye who enter here ...
</h4>
<h4>
<br/>Your destiny will never be the same again ... But what’s behind the door is worth abandoning the past forever.

<i>Dima wiped his face and head with a towel, put it on his
shoulders, left the bathroom and came back into the bedroom.<br/></i>
<p><i>-What
was in the envelope?-
he said, still drying out his hair.</i></p>
<p><i>-I
did't open it.- said
Catherine</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>-Why
not?- said Dima
surprised.</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>-I
couldn't find anything sharp.-
she said. -What if it
is something important? I was afraid that I could damage it.-</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>-Catherine,
how about tearing off the side carefully?- he said, jokingly. -Hasn't this idea crossed your beautiful model head?-</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>-Stop
making fun of me,- she
answered -And open it
yourself, Einstein.-</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>Dima took the envelope, sat on the bed and opened it
carefully. He put his hand inside and felt something that wasn’t a letter or
flyer. He removed the content of the envelope and numbly stared at it. </i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>-What’s
wrong?- asked Catherine
anxiously. -What is it?-</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>She snapped the message from his hands and held up an old
black-and-white photograph. It captured an image of her beloved and another
three men in an outdoor setting surrounded by trees. </i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>The shot looked extremely unusual. The paper was timeworn
and shabby as if it was very old, although Dima didn’t look much younger in the
picture than he actually was. It was also unusual that all of them were darkly
dressed, as if they were in deep mourning. At least it seemed so from the
black-and-white color grade of the photograph. Dima looked satisfied and happy
in the picture. He was smiling and hugging the people standing next to him.</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>-Honey,
who are these men and why don’t I know them?- she asked.</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>-I
have no idea- he
replied. </i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>-But
you all look as though you know each other well.- she said. </i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>-I
do not know anyone in this picture.- said Dima as he took the photograph from her. </i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>-You
know what?- he
continued absently while studying the photo. -I have never taken a picture like this. I have never worn these
clothes. You know very well that I don’t like black. Nothing like this has ever
happened to me. I am 100 per cent sure.-</i></p>
<h3>Hall of Shadows<br/>
</h3>
<p><i>-That's
it! - said the man in the darkness.</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>Usually, it meant that the meeting had come to an end. After
a moment, somebody would pull a bag over the old man’s head and take him back.
But this time, there was no hurry with the bag. The light was fading slowly. </i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>-One
more thing,- sounded
the mysterious voice again. -You
said that this could be a check and we are not the Shadows, that you have never
seen our faces.-</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>Suddenly, a man stepped into the fading circle of light. He
took a good look at his guest and continued. </i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>-We
decided to fill this gap in, especially since you are about to become one of us.- He held out his hand and
said confidently. -My
name is Jacques and I am the father of all Shadows not only in Paris, but in
the whole of France.-</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>Marcus got it, there was no turning back. He was to become
one of them, or die. After shaking hands, the German felt a cold and chill that
ran through his entire body. The aristocratic man smiled, let go of the hand of
the guest and faded away with the remains of light. For a moment, Marcus stayed
in total darkness.</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>His tired eyes gradually became accustomed. Through the
gloom he was able to see the silhouettes of the hall, as well as the people who
were there. The German was amazed at the splendor and luxury, which had been
hidden from his sight all the time. The huge, oval room, with extraordinary
high ceilings majestically loomed over Marcus. Pillars in the middle of the
spacious room supported the ceiling. They drew a circle of about fifteen to
twenty meters which the German stood right in the middle of.</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>The black marble with white veins was the center piece of
the pompous building. It seemed to be everywhere, from floor to ceiling.
Polished to gloss, it reflected a dim yet soft and pleasant golden-orange light
coming from old fireplace in the distance. </i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>Marcus took a deep breath, once again enjoying the
intoxicating scent, and then, having taken a look around, walked out of the
circle and followed his new acquaintance by the name of Jacques. The latter,
slowly, like a night moth headed to the source of light and warmth.</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>The German stopped abruptly. With the corner of his eye he
noticed something on the walls. Coming closer, he froze.</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>He stood in front of a picture, huge and majestic,
incredibly complex in its structure and performance, with lots of tiny details.
The paintings were so beautiful that Marcus first thought they weren’t real. It
seemed that it was either an image on a big ten by ten meters screen,
holography or some sort of an illusion.</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>He approached to touch one of them and all his doubts were
gone.The creation consisted of gold threads, precious stones, beads, oil
paints, silk and other materials. Marcus went numb - not because of these
wonders but rather of what was depicted in the picture.</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>Awe and servility overcame the German, looking at the
details of sparkling canvas. It depicted a faceless man on his knees, holding a
dying, incredibly beautiful blonde girl in his arms. Her face looked
overwhelmingly innocent, like that of an angel. A faceless man shed tears over
the bloodied body of the girl. The two were surrounded by an indifferent crowd
that gazed at the young couple coldly and mercilessly.</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>The Frenchman came up to Marcus and handed him a glass of
red wine. Taking a sip, the German quietly, almost whispering said, -Did it happen here?-</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>-Yes.- Jacques replied
thoughtfully. -How did
you know?-</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>-I
heard about the story!-
replied Marcus.</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>The host was clearly surprised by the answer. </i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>-How?- he asked.</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>-Sometimes
we had leaks of information from you.- Marcus said. </i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>Staggered, Jacques tried to ask a question. The guest knew
which question was about to come so he quickly interrupted.</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>-Do
not ask me how. Even I, with all my powers there, do not know from where and
how information arrives.-</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>The German, keeping his eyes on the work continued. -Is this that the man without a face?-</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>The Frenchman was reluctant to answer the question, but in
order to avoid awkward silence, he just nodded his head.</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>-Do
you smell the odor?- he
said, trying to change the subject.</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>-Yes!
- said Marcus. -I can
smell it every time I come here, it is extremely strange and unusual. I always
found it very interesting, but I’ve never dared to...-</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>The master interrupted, looked into Marcus’ eyes and said, </i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>-This
smell appeared at the time of her death. I remember everything as if it
happened yesterday. After he picked her up from the floor and embraced her, the
scent soared up, and filled the whole space of the hall. At that time, it was
insanely strong. - </i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>Jacques sipped some wine.</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>-The
odor has been here for twelve years now.-</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>Marcus carefully interrupted his companion. -Special doors are there
specifically to prevent the scent from disintegrating?-</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>Jacques grinned slightly. -No!-</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>-Then
what are they for?-
Marcus asked. </i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>-Many
of his close associates believe that her soul is still somewhere around and
that someday she may be reborn anew. That's why the scent is still in here. It
mysteriously reminds of itself, becoming a stronger or weaker from time to
time. We are being told it is the smell of her soul. So lovely...-</i></p>
<p><i></i></p>

<h3>
<i>Christopher and Dima Fight</i>
</h3>
<h3>
</h3>
<p><i>The streets were empty and only occasional people stood in
the shelters of the bus stops to wait for the capricious weather to get better.
Christopher rested his head against the seat. Rain and grey skies always led to
a predominantly peaceful mood which often made him sleepy. His eyes closed and
drowsiness gradually dawned on him. He drifted off into a dream. </i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>-Wake
up.- said a man’s
voice.</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>The words woke up the tired and sleepy American.</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>-Excuse
me, what did you say?-
He said drowsily. </i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>The driver looked at him from the rear view mirror with
surprise. -Me? I didn’t
say a word. You must have misheard something.-</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>The young man shrugged his shoulders, yawned and looked out
of the window. </i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>Christopher’s eyes began to close again. He was definitely
falling asleep this time. Suddenly, his eyes were drawn to a lonely young man
sitting on the bench in the rain without an umbrella. It seemed rather peculiar
so he focused his eyes to have a better look at the weirdo. What he saw made
him shudder. Fear crept into</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>his heart. In a split second his drowsiness was gone.
Overcoming his emotions the young man pulled himself together and shouted.</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>-STOP!!!-</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>The driver braked sharply thinking that he had failed to
notice a pedestrian, but after taking a look around realized it was fine.
Turning round to the back seat he asked. -What happened?-</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>The back seat was already empty but for a few banknotes.
Wiping the foggy side window he found what he was looking for. His passenger
stood outside the car door and shouted something while waving his hands.</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>Because of the grey veil of rain, Dima could not figure out
what was going on, and he repeatedly failed to get a better look at the
aggressive man. The noise of the rain and passing cars would not allow hearing
the words that he was shouting. </i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>-What?
I don’t understand!- he
shouted back.</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>Looking mad, the stranger dashed across the road in his
direction. Noticing this unpleasant development, Dima put the picture back in
his pocket, took a few steps backwards and prepared to defend himself.</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>On approach the angry words were getting audible.</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>-What
the hell do you want from me!? What is it about? Tell me!!!-</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>The man came much closer and Dima managed to have a good look
at him.</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>-What?- he whispered, surprised. -Christopher?-</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>His face twitched in an ugly evil grimace as he moved
forward.</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>The two strong, athletic and well built men went to battle.
Christopher sent his opponent to the ground with a left hook. Then he got on
top of him and the two tumbled on the wet asphalt exchanging blows.</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>Dima managed to twist out of the steel constrains and kicked
his opponent in the chin. It wasn’t strong but quite unpleasant. The man jumped
away from him and fell to the ground a few steps away.</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>Dima got up quickly, wiped out his bleeding nose and took a
few steps away from the spot of the fight. </i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>-WHO
ARE YOU???- – he
shouted. -AND WHY… DO I
KNOW YOUR NAME!?!?-</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>These words had no effect on Christopher and getting up he
moved ahead obviously intending to continue the fight.</i></p>
<i>
</i><h3><i>Christopher's Nightmare<br/></i></h3>
<i>
</i><p><i>Christopher turned his head back and rested it again on the
cold ground.</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>-That’s
the end…- he whispered.
-Close your eyes and it
will come to an end sooner.-</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>His eyelids were slowly closing.The surrounding fog suddenly
began to disperse and weak outlines of the pavement began to emerge. The
silhouette of an enormous building towered over him. </i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>The change in the surroundings offered some strength to the
man who was about to pass away.</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>The fog got thinner and thinner, and its dissolution seemed
unusual and even strange. The white haze had gone up into the air like vapour
sucked in by an air vent. </i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>Christopher turned around slowly and discovered that he was
laying in the middle of the huge crossroads. Along its sides stood grey
skyscrapers. They looked awfully grim. There were no windows, and they
consisted of pretty rough concrete blocks that seemed to be about to crash.
Immense reinforcement rods, rusted and distorted, stuck out of concrete plates
in every direction. The whole scene seemed hostile, dreadful and ominous. It
was like the fantasy of some sick, perverted, maniac mind.</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>The young man pulled himself together and shouted at the top
of his voice, -Help!!!
Somebody help!!!-</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>So, without stopping and gasping for air, he continued for a
few minutes. In response he heard only silence and the echo of his own voice.</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>From a distance came a rhythmic sound which grew louder and
closer.</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>-Hooves!- it dawned on Christopher -This is the sound of hooves.-</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>Looking in the direction where the sound came from, he saw a
big black horse approaching. It came up, lowered its head and tenderly touched
the freezing man’s face with its huge, wet nose. The warm breath of the horse
brought hope for deliverance from the frozen pale hell.</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>The unusual animal seemed familiar and it emitted incredible
warmth.Sensing that, Christopher, still shivering, got up and strongly embraced
its neck hoping to get a bit warmer. </i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>-Nice
boy…You are my nice boy-
he repeated and nestled against the unexpected friend. In response, it obeyed
and did not move, agreeably snorting from time to time.</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>-The
Future- sounded hoarse
old voice. </i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>Christopher was startled and abruptly turned around,
breaking his embrace, but there was no one in the direction where the voice
came from.</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>-Your
future!!!- shouted the
voice which seemed to be getting closer.</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>He looked around again and was surprised to find an old man
with long, grey hair and a beard. The old man was short and wore a light tunic.
He carried a stick in his hand.</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>-Oh,
God-. Thought
Christopher when he saw man’s features.</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>The old man had white eyes, with no pupils and irises.</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>-Sorry,
what?- he asked</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>-Your
future- repeated the
old man. </i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>Confusion and fear made the young man squirm, and then he whispered
as if a scared child, -I
don’t understand…What about my future? What? What is going on here?! Where am
I?-</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>All of a sudden, everything around him fell silent … the
cold had gone…and the remnants of fog had gone away. The old man raised his
hand and pointed at Christopher.</i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>-Our
future looks like soot, smells like smoke and sounds like the screams of a
thousand people.- he
said </i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>Out of nowhere, breaking the silence, the roar of a siren
came. Its sound was horrible, deafening, sickening, so terrible that both the
old man’s and Christopher’s face twitched in agony. Vibrations emitted by the
siren subdued the will and caused animal terror. Piercing the depths of
consciousness and making every second unbearable. </i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>Christopher, seeking salvation, covered his ears with hands.
Raising his head up, he saw that the buildings were starting to collapse like
houses of cards unable to resist the powerful vibration. Tremendous, grey,
stony pieces were violently falling down and landing with thunder, breaking the
asphalt. </i></p>
<i>
</i><p><i>A block of concrete separated from the building sheltering
Christopher and fell down toward him. He just helplessly looked up at his
inevitably approaching death. He held his head in his hands and fell to his
knees.</i></p>

<h4>The necessary amount is not limited to $ 15,000, we hope and believe that it will be significantly bigger. Apart from the above mentioned, we plan to create an audio-movie (radioplay), for those who like to listen while driving and especially for visually impaired people, with the full range of sounds accompanying events in the book (noises of city, cars, shots, different voices of professional actors) in several languages.

<h4>
<br/> Full TV and Internet series, with professional actors.
</h4>
<h4>
<br/>A series, consisting of 10-12 episodes will reveal no less secrets existing in the real world than the book itself, and will smoothly guide you to the beginning of the novel (prequel). The story and the movie will surprise you with high quality, and most importantly, content: a plot that will never leave you indifferent and spark an urge to demand the continuation of the story.

 No matter how much I try, no time, no video clip would be enough to squeeze all the magnitude of the mystery and the incredible beauty of emotions I experienced about 13 years ago. No time will be enough to tell you about 8 years of work on the book in which I have concealed a mystery ... Its the very beginning. The beginning of the mystery that could change everything. I believe that one dream, one incredible will, one incredibly strong feeling of a single person is able to change the world completely. Either destroy it once and for all, or save it and make it the most beautiful thing that can occur to a human mind, a place where everyone is happy regardless of what’s inside of one. This book, the first of three parts, tells about the mystery, which you've never heard of but which does exist in the real world. It is going to sweep over like a tsunami - hitting each and everyone - and there is no one to stop it. It shall spare no one and shall make all tremble at it’s might ...


The best and the most interesting story is always built around a mystery ... 

The greater a mystery is, the less people know about it and the later it is revealed. Lines of many supposedly fictional stories hold the truth ... For this reason they decide themselves when they are destined to be born and surprise the whole world… for the greatest of them will be told in the end, to change everything.

It is time for you to open the door. The door which has these words written on it ... Abandon everything you knew, ye who enter here ...


Your destiny will never be the same again ... But what’s behind the door is worth abandoning the past forever.


Infinitely with all my heart, your Peter Cry

The Black And White Photo



Dima wiped his face and head with a towel, put it on his
shoulders, left the bathroom and came back into the bedroom.
-What
was in the envelope?-
he said, still drying out his hair.
-I
did't open it.- said
Catherine

-Why
not?- said Dima
surprised.

-I
couldn't find anything sharp.-
she said. -What if it
is something important? I was afraid that I could damage it.-

-Catherine,
how about tearing off the side carefully?- he said, jokingly. -Hasn't this idea crossed your beautiful model head?-

-Stop
making fun of me,- she
answered -And open it
yourself, Einstein.-

Dima took the envelope, sat on the bed and opened it
carefully. He put his hand inside and felt something that wasn’t a letter or
flyer. He removed the content of the envelope and numbly stared at it. 

-What’s
wrong?- asked Catherine
anxiously. -What is it?-

She snapped the message from his hands and held up an old
black-and-white photograph. It captured an image of her beloved and another
three men in an outdoor setting surrounded by trees. 

The shot looked extremely unusual. The paper was timeworn
and shabby as if it was very old, although Dima didn’t look much younger in the

Hall of Shadows

-That's
it! - said the man in the darkness.

Usually, it meant that the meeting had come to an end. After
a moment, somebody would pull a bag over the old man’s head and take him back.
But this time, there was no hurry with the bag. The light was fading slowly. 

-One
more thing,- sounded
the mysterious voice again. -You
said that this could be a check and we are not the Shadows, that you have never
seen our faces.-

Suddenly, a man stepped into the fading circle of light. He
took a good look at his guest and continued. 

-We
decided to fill this gap in, especially since you are about to become one of us.- He held out his hand and
said confidently. -My
name is Jacques and I am the father of all Shadows not only in Paris, but in
the whole of France.-

Marcus got it, there was no turning back. He was to become
one of them, or die. After shaking hands, the German felt a cold and chill that
ran through his entire body. The aristocratic man smiled, let go of the hand of
the guest and faded away with the remains of light. For a moment, Marcus stayed
in total darkness.

His tired eyes gradually became accustomed. Through the
gloom he was able to see the silhouettes of the hall, as well as the people who
were there. The German was amazed at the splendor and luxury, which had been
hidden from his sight all the time. The huge, oval room, with extraordinary
high ceilings majestically loomed over Marcus. Pillars in the middle of the
spacious room supported the ceiling. They drew a circle of about fifteen to
twenty meters which the German stood right in the middle of.

The black marble with white veins was the center piece of
the pompous building. It seemed to be everywhere, from floor to ceiling.
Polished to gloss, it reflected a dim yet soft and pleasant golden-orange light
coming from old fireplace in the distance. 

Marcus took a deep breath, once again enjoying the
intoxicating scent, and then, having taken a look around, walked out of the
circle and followed his new acquaintance by the name of Jacques. The latter,
slowly, like a night moth headed to the source of light and warmth.

The German stopped abruptly. With the corner of his eye he
noticed something on the walls. Coming closer, he froze.

He stood in front of a picture, huge and majestic,
incredibly complex in its structure and performance, with lots of tiny details.
The paintings were so beautiful that Marcus first thought they weren’t real. It
seemed that it was either an image on a big ten by ten meters screen,
holography or some sort of an illusion.

He approached to touch one of them and all his doubts were
gone.The creation consisted of gold threads, precious stones, beads, oil
paints, silk and other materials. Marcus went numb - not because of these
wonders but rather of what was depicted in the picture.

Awe and servility overcame the German, looking at the
details of sparkling canvas. It depicted a faceless man on his knees, holding a
dying, incredibly beautiful blonde girl in his arms. Her face looked
overwhelmingly innocent, like that of an angel. A faceless man shed tears over
the bloodied body of the girl. The two were surrounded by an indifferent crowd
that gazed at the young couple coldly and mercilessly.

The Frenchman came up to Marcus and handed him a glass of
red wine. Taking a sip, the German quietly, almost whispering said, -Did it happen here?-

-Yes.- Jacques replied
thoughtfully. -How did
you know?-

-I
heard about the story!-
replied Marcus.

The host was clearly surprised by the answer. 

-How?- he asked.

-Sometimes
we had leaks of information from you.- Marcus said. 

Staggered, Jacques tried to ask a question. The guest knew
which question was about to come so he quickly interrupted.

-Do
not ask me how. Even I, with all my powers there, do not know from where and
how information arrives.-

The German, keeping his eyes on the work continued. -Is this that the man without a face?-

The Frenchman was reluctant to answer the question, but in
order to avoid awkward silence, he just nodded his head.

-Do
you smell the odor?- he
said, trying to change the subject.

-Yes!
- said Marcus. -I can
smell it every time I come here, it is extremely strange and unusual. I always
found it very interesting, but I’ve never dared to...-

The master interrupted, looked into Marcus’ eyes and said, 

-This
smell appeared at the time of her death. I remember everything as if it
happened yesterday. After he picked her up from the floor and embraced her, the
scent soared up, and filled the whole space of the hall. At that time, it was
insanely strong. - 

Jacques sipped some wine.

-The
odor has been here for twelve years now.-

Marcus carefully interrupted his companion. -Special doors are there
specifically to prevent the scent from disintegrating?-

Jacques grinned slightly. -No!-

-Then
what are they for?-
Marcus asked. 

-Many
of his close associates believe that her soul is still somewhere around and
that someday she may be reborn anew. That's why the scent is still in here. It
mysteriously reminds of itself, becoming a stronger or weaker from time to
time. We are being told it is the smell of her soul. So lovely...-




Christopher and Dima Fight



The streets were empty and only occasional people stood in
the shelters of the bus stops to wait for the capricious weather to get better.
Christopher rested his head against the seat. Rain and grey skies always led to
a predominantly peaceful mood which often made him sleepy. His eyes closed and
drowsiness gradually dawned on him. He drifted off into a dream. 

-Wake
up.- said a man’s
voice.

The words woke up the tired and sleepy American.

-Excuse
me, what did you say?-
He said drowsily. 

The driver looked at him from the rear view mirror with
surprise. -Me? I didn’t
say a word. You must have misheard something.-

The young man shrugged his shoulders, yawned and looked out
of the window. 

Christopher’s eyes began to close again. He was definitely
falling asleep this time. Suddenly, his eyes were drawn to a lonely young man
sitting on the bench in the rain without an umbrella. It seemed rather peculiar
so he focused his eyes to have a better look at the weirdo. What he saw made
him shudder. Fear crept into

his heart. In a split second his drowsiness was gone.
Overcoming his emotions the young man pulled himself together and shouted.

-STOP!!!-

The driver braked sharply thinking that he had failed to
notice a pedestrian, but after taking a look around realized it was fine.
Turning round to the back seat he asked. -What happened?-

The back seat was already empty but for a few banknotes.
Wiping the foggy side window he found what he was looking for. His passenger
stood outside the car door and shouted something while waving his hands.

Because of the grey veil of rain, Dima could not figure out
what was going on, and he repeatedly failed to get a better look at the
aggressive man. The noise of the rain and passing cars would not allow hearing
the words that he was shouting. 

-What?
I don’t understand!- he
shouted back.

Looking mad, the stranger dashed across the road in his
direction. Noticing this unpleasant development, Dima put the picture back in
his pocket, took a few steps backwards and prepared to defend himself.

On approach the angry words were getting audible.

-What
the hell do you want from me!? What is it about? Tell me!!!-

The man came much closer and Dima managed to have a good look
at him.

-What?- he whispered, surprised. -Christopher?-

His face twitched in an ugly evil grimace as he moved
forward.

The two strong, athletic and well built men went to battle.
Christopher sent his opponent to the ground with a left hook. Then he got on
top of him and the two tumbled on the wet asphalt exchanging blows.

Dima managed to twist out of the steel constrains and kicked
his opponent in the chin. It wasn’t strong but quite unpleasant. The man jumped
away from him and fell to the ground a few steps away.

Dima got up quickly, wiped out his bleeding nose and took a
few steps away from the spot of the fight. 

-WHO
ARE YOU???- – he
shouted. -AND WHY… DO I
KNOW YOUR NAME!?!?-

These words had no effect on Christopher and getting up he
moved ahead obviously intending to continue the fight.

Christopher's Nightmare

Christopher turned his head back and rested it again on the
cold ground.

-That’s
the end…- he whispered.
-Close your eyes and it
will come to an end sooner.-

His eyelids were slowly closing.The surrounding fog suddenly
began to disperse and weak outlines of the pavement began to emerge. The
silhouette of an enormous building towered over him. 

The change in the surroundings offered some strength to the
man who was about to pass away.

The fog got thinner and thinner, and its dissolution seemed
unusual and even strange. The white haze had gone up into the air like vapour
sucked in by an air vent. 

Christopher turned around slowly and discovered that he was
laying in the middle of the huge crossroads. Along its sides stood grey
skyscrapers. They looked awfully grim. There were no windows, and they
consisted of pretty rough concrete blocks that seemed to be about to crash.
Immense reinforcement rods, rusted and distorted, stuck out of concrete plates
in every direction. The whole scene seemed hostile, dreadful and ominous. It
was like the fantasy of some sick, perverted, maniac mind.

The young man pulled himself together and shouted at the top
of his voice, -Help!!!
Somebody help!!!-

So, without stopping and gasping for air, he continued for a
few minutes. In response he heard only silence and the echo of his own voice.

From a distance came a rhythmic sound which grew louder and
closer.

-Hooves!- it dawned on Christopher -This is the sound of hooves.-

Looking in the direction where the sound came from, he saw a
big black horse approaching. It came up, lowered its head and tenderly touched
the freezing man’s face with its huge, wet nose. The warm breath of the horse
brought hope for deliverance from the frozen pale hell.

The unusual animal seemed familiar and it emitted incredible
warmth.Sensing that, Christopher, still shivering, got up and strongly embraced
its neck hoping to get a bit warmer. 

-Nice
boy…You are my nice boy-
he repeated and nestled against the unexpected friend. In response, it obeyed
and did not move, agreeably snorting from time to time.

-The
Future- sounded hoarse
old voice. 

Christopher was startled and abruptly turned around,
breaking his embrace, but there was no one in the direction where the voice
came from.

-Your
future!!!- shouted the
voice which seemed to be getting closer.

He looked around again and was surprised to find an old man
with long, grey hair and a beard. The old man was short and wore a light tunic.
He carried a stick in his hand.

-Oh,
God-. Thought
Christopher when he saw man’s features.

The old man had white eyes, with no pupils and irises.

-Sorry,
what?- he asked

-Your
future- repeated the
old man. 

Confusion and fear made the young man squirm, and then he whispered
as if a scared child, -I
don’t understand…What about my future? What? What is going on here?! Where am
I?-

All of a sudden, everything around him fell silent … the
cold had gone…and the remnants of fog had gone away. The old man raised his
hand and pointed at Christopher.

-Our
future looks like soot, smells like smoke and sounds like the screams of a
thousand people.- he
said 

Out of nowhere, breaking the silence, the roar of a siren
came. Its sound was horrible, deafening, sickening, so terrible that both the
old man’s and Christopher’s face twitched in agony. Vibrations emitted by the
siren subdued the will and caused animal terror. Piercing the depths of
consciousness and making every second unbearable. 

Christopher, seeking salvation, covered his ears with hands.
Raising his head up, he saw that the buildings were starting to collapse like
houses of cards unable to resist the powerful vibration. Tremendous, grey,
stony pieces were violently falling down and landing with thunder, breaking the
asphalt. 

A block of concrete separated from the building sheltering
Christopher and fell down toward him. He just helplessly looked up at his
inevitably approaching death. He held his head in his hands and fell to his
knees.

Perks 














And many more...

The necessary amount is not limited to $ 15,000, we hope and believe that it will be significantly bigger. Apart from the above mentioned, we plan to create an audio-movie (radioplay), for those who like to listen while driving and especially for visually impaired people, with the full range of sounds accompanying events in the book (noises of city, cars, shots, different voices of professional actors) in several languages.




 Full TV and Internet series, with professional actors.


A series, consisting of 10-12 episodes will reveal no less secrets existing in the real world than the book itself, and will smoothly guide you to the beginning of the novel (prequel). The story and the movie will surprise you with high quality, and most importantly, content: a plot that will never leave you indifferent and spark an urge to demand the continuation of the story.


100% of the collected funds will be used solely for fulfillment of this project. None of the team's members would receive his/her share until the moment when everything you have backed returns to you in the form of backing packages of your choice and other things that we will surprise you with for  as long as we can.


Peter Cry
It took me 6 years to write the novel and another 2 years to improve it to the appropriate level after I experienced something I can hardly believe myself, although eyes and ears are hard to deceive. 
Throughout these 8 long years I did everything I could and now I can continue this journey only with you or rather, thanks to you. I ask you to support my dream, it can surprise the whole world and I ask you to become part of it.
I’m grateful for the possibility to address you with all of the above. I had waited for this moment for 8 years. I and every member of our team will be grateful to you with all the heart and soul - for every dollar, every cent that you back us up with, for any help and even a single moment of attention you donate to the project ...

<p>My twin sons, Michael and Daniel, were born with the aid of a surrogate mother in India, in April 2012. I raise them on my own. When I decided to become a father, they became my first priority. My writing is second, my personal life is next.</p>
<p>A Writing Father-Mother</p>
<p>I call myself 'a writing mother', because that's what I am - a single gay father-mother of two boys, who need me daily. I clean and cook, I do laundry and take care of our dog and cats and garden, and basically do everything on my own. Since I have to support my kids financially I teach between 6-8 writing courses in a semester, and edit 1-3 books a month. This makes writing almost impossible.</p>
<p>My Future projects</p>
<p>I am now in the process writing 3 new novels. One is half written. It is a novel that takes place during the Renaissance. The second is partly written, and it deals with a Jewish historical figure of the 17th century. The third novel is under research, and its protagonist is a Jewish woman who is also an historical figure from the 16th century.<br/>I need more time to turn my last three novels into scripts for the cinema and television international market.</p>
<p>My mission</p>
<p>As a Jewish gay writer and activist, one of the first gay men who went out of the closet, back in the 1980's, my mission is to re-invent Judaism in a subversive way. I implant homosexuality in the history of the Jewish nation, where it was silenced for centuries, and impose subjective or imaginary memory on the collective memory of the Jewish nation. I need writing time for my next three novels and time to turn my best-sellers into scripts for the TV and cinema international market. By supporting my writing, you will help me change the Israeli society, or at least help a single gay writing Mom-Dad go back to his desk.</p>
</div><div>
<p>I need 72,000 $ because this is my yearly budget. As much as I will get will enable me to save my working hours for writing, reduce my teaching and editing hours, without harming my parenting time.</p>
<p>My free time is only while my kids are in the kindergurten, between 08.00 am-16.00 pm. But this slot of time goes first to earning money, cleaning, doing laundry, cooking, attending our dog and two cats, gardening, etc. At nights I read my students writing asyngements. This is the reason that those days I write only during my own courses, while my students are writing too. This is impossible. </p>
<p>My main perk for you is my best-seller 'A Tale of a Ring' in English. A Tale of A Ring is a fascinating page-turner based on the real historical events wich took place in Argentina and East-Europe between the years 1870-1930. An organization of Jewish pimps by the name of Tzvi Migdal persuaded Jewish families in Poland and Lithuania to entrust it with their daughters, promising to marry them to Jewish husbands or find them domestic work in Jewish homes in Buenos Aires. These girls fell victim to a sophisticated underground network that enslaved them for the rest of their lives, with the support and collaboration of the local police and the government.</p>
<p>The Jewish community fought with all their might against these pimp and their supporting partners, which were called “Las Impuros” - The Unclean. The same caused the affair to be silenced and repressed from the collective memory of the Jewish community. Now, for the first time, the historical truth is revealed, in a well-researched and fascinating novel that became an Israeli best seller, selling over 80,000 copies since its publication in 2007.</p>
<p>I also offer you an un-printed poem of mine or a collection of my poems in word document, translated into English. My higher perks makes you a creative partners of mine - by thanking you in my next novel, or by giving a writing instruction or lecture to a person or a group in Israel according to your choice.</p>
<p>By helping me meet my target you will enable me to write three novels this year. One is half written. It is a novel that takes place during the Renaissance. The second is partly written, and it deals with a Jewish historical figure of the 17th century. The third novel is under research, and its protagonist is a Jewish woman who is also an historical figure from the 16th century.</p>
<p>But any sum I will get will entitle me with some hours of writing. Any dollar you give buys me some time for writing. I bless you for that. Since I started to publish my works, in the early 1980's, I helped many Israeli GLBT to find their queer identity. Your contribution will make it happen deeper and faster.</p>
<p>S. Daniel Breslauer wrote, in his book ""Creating a Judaism Without Religion: A Postmodern Jewish Possibility"": ""The young Israeli poet, Ilan Sheinfeld, has offered powerful writings that seduce the reader into an experience that alters ones sense of self. Sheinfeld uses words for performative purposes. To speak or write a word, to read or to hear it, is to experience a reality [...] Sheinfeld has been a pioneer in gay literature in Israel, and his poems provide a vital experience that draws the reader into the feelings and emotions of love.""</p>
<p>Caryn S. Aviv, ‎David Shneer write, in their book ""New Jews: The End of the Jewish Diaspora"": ""The gay Israeli poet, Ilan Sheinfeld, in his poem 'my Identity', adds that, at least for queer Jewish Israelis, travel is a source of identity formation.""</p>
<p>Lee Walzer, in his book ""Between Sodom and Eden: A Gay Journey Through Today's Changing Israel"" wrote: ""What I found was a very bright, personable, and engaging man. What most impressed my about him was that he was engaged with his Judaism in a way few secular Israelis would admit today. Judaism for him was not a topic in which he engaged separate from the rest of his life. Rather, he had a constant internal dialogue going between his Judaism and his homosexuality.

I raise them on my own. When I decided to become a father, they became my first priority. My writing is second, my personal life is next.
A Writing Father-Mother
I call myself 'a writing mother', because that's what I am - a single gay father-mother of two boys, who need me daily. I clean and cook, I do laundry and take care of our dog and cats and garden, and basically do everything on my own. Since I have to support my kids financially I teach between 6-8 writing courses in a semester, and edit 1-3 books a month. This makes writing almost impossible.
My Future projects
I am now in the process writing 3 new novels. One is half written. It is a novel that takes place during the Renaissance. The second is partly written, and it deals with a Jewish historical figure of the 17th century. The third novel is under research, and its protagonist is a Jewish woman who is also an historical figure from the 16th century.I need more time to turn my last three novels into scripts for the cinema and television international market.
My mission
As a Jewish gay writer and activist, one of the first gay men who went out of the closet, back in the 1980's, my mission is to re-invent Judaism in a subversive way. I implant homosexuality in the history of the Jewish nation, where it was silenced for centuries, and impose subjective or imaginary memory on the collective memory of the Jewish nation. I need writing time for my next three novels and time to turn my best-sellers into scripts for the TV and cinema international market. By supporting my writing, you will help me change the Israeli society, or at least help a single gay writing Mom-Dad go back to his desk.

I need 72,000 $ because this is my yearly budget. As much as I will get will enable me to save my working hours for writing, reduce my teaching and editing hours, without harming my parenting time.
My free time is only while my kids are in the kindergurten, between 08.00 am-16.00 pm. But this slot of time goes first to earning money, cleaning, doing laundry, cooking, attending our dog and two cats, gardening, etc. At nights I read my students writing asyngements. This is the reason that those days I write only during my own courses, while my students are writing too. This is impossible. 
My main perk for you is my best-seller 'A Tale of a Ring' in English. A Tale of A Ring is a fascinating page-turner based on the real historical events wich took place in Argentina and East-Europe between the years 1870-1930. An organization of Jewish pimps by the name of Tzvi Migdal persuaded Jewish families in Poland and Lithuania to entrust it with their daughters, promising to marry them to Jewish husbands or find them domestic work in Jewish homes in Buenos Aires. These girls fell victim to a sophisticated underground network that enslaved them for the rest of their lives, with the support and collaboration of the local police and the government.
The Jewish community fought with all their might against these pimp and their supporting partners, which were called “Las Impuros” - The Unclean. The same caused the affair to be silenced and repressed from the collective memory of the Jewish community. Now, for the first time, the historical truth is revealed, in a well-researched and fascinating novel that became an Israeli best seller, selling over 80,000 copies since its publication in 2007.
I also offer you an un-printed poem of mine or a collection of my poems in word document, translated into English. My higher perks makes you a creative partners of mine - by thanking you in my next novel, or by giving a writing instruction or lecture to a person or a group in Israel according to your choice.
By helping me meet my target you will enable me to write three novels this year. One is half written. It is a novel that takes place during the Renaissance. The second is partly written, and it deals with a Jewish historical figure of the 17th century. The third novel is under research, and its protagonist is a Jewish woman who is also an historical figure from the 16th century.
But any sum I will get will entitle me with some hours of writing. Any dollar you give buys me some time for writing. I bless you for that. Since I started to publish my works, in the early 1980's, I helped many Israeli GLBT to find their queer identity. Your contribution will make it happen deeper and faster.
S. Daniel Breslauer wrote, in his book ""Creating a Judaism Without Religion: A Postmodern Jewish Possibility"": ""The young Israeli poet, Ilan Sheinfeld, has offered powerful writings that seduce the reader into an experience that alters ones sense of self. Sheinfeld uses words for performative purposes. To speak or write a word, to read or to hear it, is to experience a reality [...] Sheinfeld has been a pioneer in gay literature in Israel, and his poems provide a vital experience that draws the reader into the feelings and emotions of love.""
Caryn S. Aviv, ‎David Shneer write, in their book ""New Jews: The End of the Jewish Diaspora"": ""The gay Israeli poet, Ilan Sheinfeld, in his poem 'my Identity', adds that, at least for queer Jewish Israelis, travel is a source of identity formation.""
Lee Walzer, in his book ""Between Sodom and Eden: A Gay Journey Through Today's Changing Israel"" wrote: ""What I found was a very bright, personable, and engaging man. What most impressed my about him was that he was engaged with his Judaism in a way few secular Israelis would admit today. Judaism for him was not a topic in which he engaged separate from the rest of his life. Rather, he had a constant internal dialogue going between his Judaism and his homosexuality. Add to that the power and richness of his Hebrew and the hot gay erotic poetry he composes in the ancient\modern language and you have a central cultural figure.""

<h3>We would like to talk to you about our ""Folding Stick"", a project that started about a year ago and is almost completed.</h3>

<p><strong>This idea</strong> originated one day watching our five year old son: he was playing with some colourful wooden sticks and started creating shapes with them. We can say, that was his first project!!</p>
<p><strong>Folding Stick is an educational game</strong>. It is simple to use, but it can really affect positively children’s learning abilities. Nonetheless, it is an unexpected anti stress for grown ups.....</p>

<p> </p>
<p>This project is made of colourful plastic sticks put together and folding. It also comes with a book that contains letters of the alphabet so the children can use the sticks to create back the letters.</p>
<p>The book’s artwork is very simple, in order not to distract the child while he concentrates on the letters.</p>
<p>We have noticed that with this method ""<strong>Create and learn</strong>"" children learn quicker and memorize the letters more effectively.</p>
<p>With Folding Stick you can play together with your son: you can create and guess the shape of the letters.</p>
<p>It is our intention to have a YouTube channel where we'll upload the children creations made with the Folding Stick.</p>
<p><strong>The creation</strong> that will receive the higher number of votes will be awarded with a <strong>scholarship</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Folding Stick is fully made in Italy, with guaranteed and controlled non-toxic materials.</strong></p>
<p>The book will be translated into English, Spanish and Italian.</p>

<p><strong>My love for art and colours</strong> is the main feature of my character and I tend to involve in my passion the people of my family and around me. One of the projects I created is the Alphabet Folding Stick.</p>
<p><strong>I got the idea </strong>one day watching my son playing with colourful wooden sticks.</p>
<p>As it is in my natural inclination, I decided to improve this instrument in order to make it more interactive and straightforward.</p>
<p>When I first gave my son the prototype of the Alphabet, he immediately started playing with it and guessing the shapes of the letters.</p>
<p>In only a few days he finished the book, with all its letters and the numbers included.</p>
<p>I also tested the toy on a friend’s daughter, in order to understand its effectiveness and I could see that the girl had the same outcome as my son: she quickly learnt all the letters and showed to be able to recreate them even without the Alphabet.</p>
<p>That meant that she had already intaken all the shapes and could recall their name without aids. This is how I understood that “doing is learning”.</p>
<p>After that, i decided to play the game over dinner with friends and their sons. We played together and the children were crying cheerfully repeating the shapes of the letters and guessing their correct name.</p>
<p>That was a wonderful night and a very funny one! From that occasion an idea came up to create an award for children using the Alphabet Folding Sticks: your children can create letters using one or more Folding sticks without the guidance of the parents, or if necessary, the least possibile help in order to incentivize the children’s creativity.</p>
<p>You can send the videos to the mailbox of the Folding sticks and they will be uploaded on a proper related YouTube channel. The child whose video will receive the higher number of visualisations, along with a high mark of a pedagogist that will watch all uploadings, will receive a scolarship.</p>
<p><strong>The logo is inspired by a Vulcan salute</strong>. The Vulcan salute here shown has a mean if for each finger. Tai nasha no karosha =Live long and prosper.</p>
<p>The pinky finger represents the ""idic philosophy=infinte differences in infinite combinations. The ring finger represents the philosophy of the name(everything).</p>
<p>The middle finger,which is the longest,represents the teaching of logica and emotion. The index finger represents the Vulcan respect for life and held together with the middle finger it means we are always learning about life and emotion.</p>
<p>The thumb on its own represents the importance of each individual and his privacy.</p>
<p>The use of this salute with its ritual words means we acknowledge others their mental privacy and their right to be different.We also invite them to combine with the worlds differences.</p>

<p>Do writers need their own website builder?</p>
<p>We asked around, and we got a whopping reply of YES. Seems like the current tools are too complicated, or too generic, or too expensive, or created with something completely different in mind. Sounds familiar? If so, you're in the same boat as the many writers we've interviewed.</p>
<p>Writers (like you and us) need a better solution. We need a builder that cuts down on the effort, frustration, and time it takes to put together a professional website.</p>
<p>That's why we've come up with Readership Pro, the ultimate website builder for writers, with the best of all worlds:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple</li>
<li>Time-saving</li>
<li>Gorgeous</li>
<li>Affordable</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436967915/kwxzzycrliclplwab8cx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Readership Pro is designed with two parts: wizard forms and free-form pages.</p>
<p><b>Wizard forms</b> will allow you to enter information about your books, series, reviews, awards, and much more. They take this information and transform it into beautiful, formatted, and consistent pages.</p>
<p>These forms will also save you the need to enter information more than once. For example, let's say you've received a 5-star review on your book. Congratulations! You'll want to boast this review on the book page, on your Reviews page, and perhaps even on the front page. With our wizard forms, you will only have to fill in a single ""Review"" form, and the information will appear everywhere it needs to be. It's that simple!</p>
<p>But simplicity is not everything. You're a creative person, and people like you and us need the freedom to create, too. That's why the second half of Readership Pro is <b>free-form pages</b>. Think of these as a wide canvas on which you can paint with our selection of tools (a.k.a. widgets). You can add an image widget, a text widget, a divider, and more, position them however you like, and enter whatever content you need.

</p><p>Here's a mockup of how the free-form section will look:</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440358910/hispnuco4e5sklrm9bia.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p>Wizard forms and free-form pages are a powerful combination that will let you create a professional website at one tenth of the usual time.</p>

Do writers need their own website builder?
We asked around, and we got a whopping reply of YES. Seems like the current tools are too complicated, or too generic, or too expensive, or created with something completely different in mind. Sounds familiar? If so, you're in the same boat as the many writers we've interviewed.
Writers (like you and us) need a better solution. We need a builder that cuts down on the effort, frustration, and time it takes to put together a professional website.
That's why we've come up with Readership Pro, the ultimate website builder for writers, with the best of all worlds:

Simple
Time-saving
Gorgeous
Affordable


Readership Pro is designed with two parts: wizard forms and free-form pages.
Wizard forms will allow you to enter information about your books, series, reviews, awards, and much more. They take this information and transform it into beautiful, formatted, and consistent pages.
These forms will also save you the need to enter information more than once. For example, let's say you've received a 5-star review on your book. Congratulations! You'll want to boast this review on the book page, on your Reviews page, and perhaps even on the front page. With our wizard forms, you will only have to fill in a single ""Review"" form, and the information will appear everywhere it needs to be. It's that simple!
But simplicity is not everything. You're a creative person, and people like you and us need the freedom to create, too. That's why the second half of Readership Pro is free-form pages. Think of these as a wide canvas on which you can paint with our selection of tools (a.k.a. widgets). You can add an image widget, a text widget, a divider, and more, position them however you like, and enter whatever content you need.

Here's a mockup of how the free-form section will look:Wizard forms and free-form pages are a powerful combination that will let you create a professional website at one tenth of the usual time.

We put together an awesome list of perks to help you back this project. Choose whatever works for you best! And remember, you can always mix-and-match more than one perk.
There are five types of perks you can choose from.

A little bit of background


I'm Katherine, the Founding Director of Beauty and Utility Arts, a Leicestershire based Arts and Health social
 enterprise, developing and managing creative projects and products with
 social benefits. 
For a little bit more about what makes me tick, here's an article I wrote recently giving my 22 year old self a bit of advice.Finding solutions is something I really enjoy. Mix that together with a love of people watching and a creative approach and that describes how I work.

household name around the world. In the other corner, weighing in at
just 160 pounds, the diminutive Englishman Carl Mysto, Bradford born
and bred, one-time plumber, and now full-time music hall magician and
escapologist. On St. Valentine's Day, 1905, the battle-lines were

</div></div>","'When Wizards Walked This Earth'The Historically Based Novel About the Feud Between Magicians Harry Houdini and Carl Mysto in the Year 1905!This full-length novel also includes an appendix featuring a selection of all-new magic & mind-reading routines created by Paul Voodini and based around the story!In the English city of
Bradford, in the year 1905, two of the greatest wizards ever to have
lived faced off in a climactic confrontation to decide, once and for
always, who could claim the title of 'Cock of the North'! In one
corner stood the Hungarian-American Harry Houdini, fast climbing the
ladder of success and celebrity, well on his way to becoming a
household name around the world. In the other corner, weighing in at
just 160 pounds, the diminutive Englishman Carl Mysto, Bradford born
and bred, one-time plumber, and now full-time music hall magician and
escapologist. On St. Valentine's Day, 1905, the battle-lines were
drawn; one magician's career would be massacred, leaving the other's
path to glory and fame unobstructed. 
 

Harry Houdini on the left and Carl Mysto on the right in typical 'escapologist' pose!Except it didn't quite
work out that way. February 14th 1905 is not a date
celebrated by magicians, its importance in the development of magic
and the mystery arts remains, for the largest part, unrecorded and
unknown. Houdini, of course, would go on to be celebrated as the
greatest magician of all time. But what scars did he carry from that
Valentine's Day confrontation, and how did his bloody encounter with
Carl Mysto shape the celebrity that he was destined to become?

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I'm a 72 year old man who has feelings about the state of our society.  I've taken a lot of these feelings and I've written a 120 page book of commentaries.  If I had what it takes to be a stand up comedian, these would be my bits.  I do think I could be a replacement for Andy Rooney of 60 Minutes, because then I'd have a teleprompter and no audience to heckle me.  But I don't think  CBS would let me say some of the things I wrote in my book, since our country has gone nuts with all this politically correct stuff.  How can we communicate our true feelings if we need to white wash everything we say?  It's like the only honest guy on TV was Archie Bunker.</p>
<p>I hope my commentaries push some buttons and give readers some new ways to think about things.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I just want people read my book.  I'm not going to make any profit with this on Indiegogo.   Adding up the cost to print a small quantity of books, and mailing them, and then deducting Indiegogo fees, it comes pretty close to what I am asking for each book.  You will get my honest opinion about a lot of major social issues and how I would fix everything if I were King.  Some of my ideas are kinda out there, but ideas that seem crazy now can become reality one day.  My ideas may spark other ideas which could make the world a much nicer place.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you don't want to cough up the $11.50 for the paperback book, ($10 plus $1.50 for shipping) you can still read it.  It's available on Amazon as a Kindle Book and on Audible as as Audio Book for a lot less.  Just do a search on those platforms for John Primm.  But the physical book is a lot more fun than those versions, such as the illustrations and a few other things.  It makes a great bathroom book.  Each chapter is only 4 pages, and so if you just read one chapter while on the pot and then move on, you will greatly decrease your chances of getting hemorrhoids.</p>

<p>Astrology is seen as an intriguing science by millions of people. Yet it began as a way to predict floods and other terrestrial events. NO ONE seems to know how it evolved into a way to determine personality or the future. Furthermore, when was the last time a planet, star or solar system helped you assess or your life or the people around you? But we all look back on key moments in time (especially the darker aspects of our life and relationship journeys) for how they have shaped who we are today and our outlook moving forward. And for thousands of years ancient cultures were acutely aware of the role primal energy played in shaping the human consciousness and physical relationships.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Men and women are a lot alike in many ways. But on a primal level, we’re vastly different. While we both respond to life experiences similarly, for men there’s something more powerful quietly pulling the strings.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For a man, there is nothing more important than evolving from a boy to an enlightened man. There are five stages or <strong>Levels</strong> of evolution. Each <strong>Level</strong> has a completely different outlook than the others. Where a man ranks within these <strong>Levels</strong> has a lot to do with how the first of his male ancestors fared in battles won or lost millennia ago.</p>

<p>For a woman, being loved, cherished and protected tends to take center stage. No woman wants to surrender to love just to be lied to, cheated on, abused or taken advantage of. When the people in a woman’s childhood or adult life fail to love, cherish or protect her, primal forces will force her outlook to change so that she may adapt and survive. How it changes depends a lot on her life journey, self-esteem, mental strength and her unique connection to the universe.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.themindsets.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>TheMindsets</strong></a> explains how a woman’s life experiences and a man’s primal quest to evolve from a boy to an enlightened man plays out individually and in several key relationship categories. Because a man’s outlook is more basic and a woman’s outlook is more complex, there are only five male signs and twelve female signs. Other than that, <strong>TheMindsets</strong> offers everything that astrology does, such as detailed delineations of each sign’s unique personality and traits along with weekly forecasts (called <strong>Mindscopes</strong>) and relationship compatibility in the areas of love, sex, family and career. But <strong>TheMindsets</strong> goes even further by explaining how couples match up in key areas that aren’t mentioned in a horoscope, such as:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i><strong>Principles and Codes of Conduct</strong></i>: the values that rule and inspire us can make or break friendships and relationships. Yet these principles and codes of conduct—especially the darker ones—can remain hidden in a friend or lover for years until a situation forces them out to ruin the relationship. With <strong>TheMindsets</strong> the layers are peeled back allowing you to get to know a person’s principles and codes of conduct and how they stack up against yours before you become emotionally attached to them.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><i><strong>Religion</strong></i>: religion is another subject that can make or break a relationship. With <strong>TheMindsets</strong>, you will gain valuable insight into a person’s true religious intent and how the two of you match up in this sacred spiritual realm.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i><strong>Unified Soul</strong></i>: similar to a soulmate, a Unified Soul is the most powerful connection two people can enjoy here on earth. For a couple to become a Unified Soul, they must establish (and maintain) harmony in five key emotional aspects. Doing so is quite a challenge but certainly achievable.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>ABOUT ME</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The first question I have asked when I explain my creation to people is, “How did you come up with this?”. And the answer to that question is always the same. I don’t know. I do know that I have been blessed with the ability to sense and interpret primal energy in others and that even as a child I could see spirits and spirit energy was drawn to me. I also know that my mother had psychic abilities. But because her religion did not give credence to such gifts, when spirit energy spoke to her, she would retreat to her room. As a child, on one such day I came to her and asked her what she was doing. Needing to talk, she explained to me what she was sensing. Such conversations developed what would become a very powerful friendship between her and I.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For many years I kept what I sensed to myself as well, only using it to maintain an edge over the people I interacted with in my social life and career. In 2015, my mother became sick and was near death. During our final conversation she told me that my gift was nothing to be ashamed of and that it should not be kept a secret. She went on to tell me that the world could benefit from what I sensed and to use it to that end. Minutes later, she passed away. Later that evening, I began working on <strong>TheMindsets</strong>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So far, I’ve raised a little over $26,000.00 from people who believe in me and my idea. That money allowed me to take some time off from work to focus on content and to develop the website. All I had to work with initially was a handful of personalities scribbled on a notepad and my vision. Now that I have content, images and icons all flowing seamlessly together, I have a clearer understanding of what else needs to be done to move the idea forward.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>You can visit my website <a href=""https://www.themindsets.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>TheMindsets.com</strong></a> and read about the male and female signs, learn about their compatibility in key relationship categories and even take a free reading to see what Mindset you are. However, I lacked the funds to hire the best web developers to create the site, so the site needs some major upgrades in order to compete with the astrology websites. The following is a list of how the funding will be spent:</p>
<ol>
<li>The current survey platforms used to perform free readings are very basic and not entirely accurate. The bulk of the funding will be used to upgrade to be more accurate and user-friendly system.</li>
<li>Being told what sign we are based on our birthday is outdated! <a href=""https://www.themindsets.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>TheMindsets.com</strong></a> will be adding a feature allowing readers to Discover their sign based on their own unique understanding of their life experiences.</li>
<li>Change the sites payment gateway from Paypal to either Merchant One or Flagship.</li>
<li>Incorporate a live phone/chat service so that I and people I train (initiates) may speak to readers via the website, help them in learning their sign and assist them on their life and relationship journeys.</li>
<li>The purchase of a laptop or Surface Pro to perform personalized readings while keeping track of member issues on the go.</li>
<li>Add a feature allowing readers to enter a code and learn what sign they are.</li>
<li>Search engine optimization.</li>
<li>Add a feature allowing free membership for up to six months.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p>Although I could use more funding than what I’m asking for, the eight thousand dollars would allow me to fine-tune a product that can compete with astrology. If I do not get full funding I’m hopeful to at least receive enough funding to get the most important upgrades done.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The wisdom of the universe is not dead! There’s still a wealth of undiscovered informational energy out there waiting to be retrieved by those of us who can access it. I believe I’ve done just that. My goal is to share what I’ve uncovered with all who care to listen and learn. But I need your help.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I started out wanting to be an engineer, but I jumped ship after my freshman year of college thinking that I would be stuck in an office. (I didn't know any engineers at the time and didn't realize that they get sent all over the world). I studied in Germany for a year and then came back to Texas, but I basically floundered around for a while not knowing what I wanted to do with my life. I got a job at Continental Airlines so that I could travel for free (or close to it), and that's what I did for a while. </p>
<p>Eventually, I realized that I wanted more out of life and that I also wanted a job that paid enough to actually do stuff when I traveled... So I got serious and went back to college. I got my bachelors and then a masters, both in engineering, and then went to work, like a normal adult. Little did I know that adulting wasn't totally my cup of tea. </p>
<p>I worked as an offshore structural engineer for a few years. I loved the math part of it and the problem solving, but sitting behind a desk for nine or ten hours every day made me miserable. That combined with the 3 or 4 hours I spent every day sitting in the car going to and from work made my joints ache and made me feel like I had the flu. Every day. </p>
<p>Just about the time I decided that I was ready for a change, the bottom dropped out of the oil and gas market, and I got laid off. Oddly enough, I really wasn't upset about it. I saw it as an opportunity to do something completely different. </p>
<p>I decided to become a teacher and have never really looked back. As luck would have it, the first job offer I had was to teach high school math. I was hesitant about working with teenagers at first (the little kids are still sweet and still like grownups), but I'm really glad that I took the job. Now after being with the older kids for a few years, I'm not sure I would really want to teach the younger ones.</p>
<p>One of the things I gained by becoming a teacher is free time and the energy to actually use it (now that I don't sit for 12 or 13 hours a day). I always wrote stories when I was younger, but I never really did anything with them. When I started teaching, I decided to start writing again. </p>
<p>At some point along my journey, I fell in love with sailing. I thought it was when I joined the sail team in college, but I was looking back at some old drawings I did when I was little and found a self portrait I drew when I was six years old, of me in a hammock on a sailboat. I even drew an arrow at the stick figure in the hammock and labeled it ""April."" So apparently, I have been in love with sailing for longer than I thought.</p>
<p>Most of my stories involve sailing in someway, but I realized that my experience in college, quite a few years ago, wasn't going to be enough to keep my stories realistic. Feeling that my stories would benefit from having an actual sailboat to practice on, and feeling that life was somehow passing me by, I bought an old run-down sailboat recently. Actually, I traded a 1988 Toyota Celica that wasn't selling on Craigslist for an old sailboat that hadn't been selling on Craigslist. </p>
<p>I can't afford the kind of boat I would like for long-distance cruising to the Caribbean and beyond on a teacher's salary. I could wait until I make it big as an author, but if you always wait until conditions are perfect for whatever it is that you want to do, chances are you will always just be waiting and you won't ever do it. The boat I traded my car for is a 32 foot Ericson sailboat built in 1970. My dad and I have been working on it together- neither one of us has much experience fixing sailboats, but at least he is mechanical enough to know how to do most of what we have been doing so far. </p>
<p>The boat is in really rough shape. Nothing much worked on her when I got her. The electrical system is a jumbled mess. One of the previous owners took the engine out completely. There is no bathroom... Well okay, there's a toilet, but it isn't connected to anything and isn't currently usable. The galley was stripped out. There's a hole where the stove once was. The cushions were disgusting and had to be thrown away. I guess ""rough shape"" is putting it kind of mildly. The layout of the boat is good though, and to quote the movie <u>Money Pit</u>, ""If the foundation is good, everything else can be fixed.""</p>
<p>This campaign is all about fixing up the sailboat, which I named Sea Bean. (Sea beans are cute and they are supposed to be good luck, so I figured it was kind of a fitting name). I plan on writing an account of everything we are going through while trying to bring her back from the brink of sailboat death. I also needed a boat to sail around on for the next book in my young adult series. Not to give away too much of the plot, but in the first book, <u>Away Away</u>, the brother and sister protagonists steal a sailboat to escape a military plot. By the end of the book, they have developed a taste for sailing but find themselves without a boat. My plan is to use Sea Bean as a model of the kind of boat they might get in the next book in the series. I think that fixing her up and sailing her around Galveston Bay will provide quite a bit of material for the other books in the series.</p>
<p>With this campaign, you are funding a dream, an adventure, and several books.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need a lot. More specifically though, there are certain systems that you actually need to be able to use a sailboat, and then there are those things that would be really nice to have. </p>
<p>To actually be able to sail the Sea Bean, we need these:</p>
<ul>
<li>The electrical wiring sorted out. We are doing a lot of the wiring ourselves, but we will need a marine electrician to give it the final okay. We also need the marine electrician to help us ground the wiring and the mast. I spoke to an electrician in my area who charges $80 per hour. I estimate that we will need at least 5 hours of his time. This would put it at $400. I am going to estimate the cost at $500 just in case something comes up that we didn't expect.</li>
<li>Plumbing for the head (boat speak for bathroom) $600 total<ul>
<li>Holding tank- $130</li>
<li>Vented loop sections (to avoid sinking the boat with the toilet intake) $200</li>
<li>Various hoses for the toilet connection $70</li>
<li>Deck access and hose for pumping out the holding tank $200</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cushion Replacement $1000<ul><li>I plan on making the cushions myself, but the materials are not cheap. I estimate a total of $1000 for material, foam, batting and special foam wrap to keep moisture out.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Bow Pulpit to replace the broken one- $950<ul><li>$750 for the pulpit + $200 shipping from the manufacturer in Florida</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Emergency puppy ramp to get my dogs back on board if and when they fall overboard $200</li>
<li>Batteries $400<ul><li>It has one battery already, but in order to keep the masthead light and other lights going while away from the dock, it needs more than one battery. I also need to construct a frame to hold the batteries in place.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Life Raft $1500<ul><li>I don't think this one really needs much explanation. </li></ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Rough total: $5100</p>
<p>There are several other things that would be nice to have and would make sailing a lot more enjoyable. If this campaign generates more than $5000, I will put the excess money toward some of these things as well, a new engine being at the top of the list.</p>
<ul>
<li>Radar system</li>
<li>A bottom job, with new thru-hull fittings</li>
<li>GPS unit </li>
<li>Bimini top (awning for shade to keep us out of the sun while sailing)</li>
<li>A new galley stove</li>
<li>Brand new sails</li>
<li>A replacement engine</li>
</ul>
<p>If I don't reach my goal, I will put the money toward as many of the 'must-haves' as I can. If I make enough to take care of everything on both of my lists, I will donate the rest to a local non-profit community sailing club and to the writing club at my school.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I have some great perks in mind for this campaign. There are of course, mugs and t-shirts, but because of what this project represents, I wanted to make the perks a little more personal as well. For some of the bottom levels of donations, I will give you an actual sea bean that I have kept on the Sea Bean. (Stay tuned for pictures). Other perks include have characters in the upcoming books named after you and the chance of becoming a beta reader for my books (scoring free copies of the books in the process).</p>
<p>For larger donations, I wanted something completely unique and personal. I love to quilt. So, I decided that for my larger donors, I want to make handmade reading quilts (throw blanket sized) in nautical/ tropical/ sailing themes. They will be completely personalized to you, and one of a kind. I will make the quilt myself. I will even send you pictures of me making your quilt.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project isn't just about fixing up an old boat. This project is an awakening of a dream and the re-imagining of life in general. The 9 to 5 system that we have somehow fallen into isn't a natural one. People aren't meant to sit for 12 or 13 hours a day. Sailing and writing are my passions, and this campaign gets me one step closer to my dream of being able to write full-time, but it also gives you the chance to experience an awakening of your own. I remember vividly the feeling of being trapped in my office every day. I truly felt like I was stuck in the human version of a puppy crate. One of the things that got me through my days was being able to follow along with various sailing and travel blogs about people who had escaped the 9 to 5 scene and were out living again. </p>
<p>I will keep you informed and involved in this project every step of the way. The Sea Bean Project can be your beacon in the corporate darkness. My hope is that it will generate enough excitement to inspire you to one day escape the rat race yourself and give you enough courage to follow your dreams as well.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The challenges of this project mostly involve tackling DIY type projects that I've never done before. For example, I've never installed a toilet on a boat before. I've never rewired a boat before either. With my dad's practical knowledge and my engineering/ problem-solving mindset, I think that together we are more than able to meet these challenges. Also, now that we are in a digital age, I figure there's a YouTube video on just about everything. I'm sure there are videos on the types of things we are doing too.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Maybe right now you are strapped for cash and just can't afford to help monetarily. That's okay too! You can still help. </p>
<p>You can spread the word on social media. Social media marketing is not my strength. In fact, I'd have to say that I kind of suck at it. Last time I looked, I only had 22 followers on Twitter. Seriously. But you have social media skills. Make some noise about my campaign. Push people in my direction. That would be a huge help!</p>
<p>Also, don't forget to use the Indiegogo share tools!</p>
</div><p>Thank you so much for checking out my campaign, and thanks in advance for supporting me. I hope that my project brings you as much joy as it does me.</p></div>","Short Summary

One of the things that got me through my days was being able to follow along with various sailing and travel blogs about people who had escaped the 9 to 5 scene and were out living again. 
I will keep you informed and involved in this project every step of the way. The Sea Bean Project can be your beacon in the corporate darkness. My hope is that it will generate enough excitement to inspire you to one day escape the rat race yourself and give you enough courage to follow your dreams as well.

Risks & Challenges
The challenges of this project mostly involve tackling DIY type projects that I've never done before. For example, I've never installed a toilet on a boat before. I've never rewired a boat before either. With my dad's practical knowledge and my engineering/ problem-solving mindset, I think that together we are more than able to meet these challenges. Also, now that we are in a digital age, I figure there's a YouTube video on just about everything. I'm sure there are videos on the types of things we are doing too.

Other Ways You Can Help
Maybe right now you are strapped for cash and just can't afford to help monetarily. That's okay too! You can still help. 
You can spread the word on social media. Social media marketing is not my strength. In fact, I'd have to say that I kind of suck at it. Last time I looked, I only had 22 followers on Twitter. Seriously. But you have social media skills. Make some noise about my campaign. Push people in my direction. That would be a huge help!
Also, don't forget to use the Indiegogo share tools!
Thank you so much for checking out my campaign, and thanks in advance for supporting me. I hope that my project brings you as much joy as it does me.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

With an ever-growing team of dedicated individuals behind and backing it, PurMag is an ultra new-era magazine with powerful, creative, and perhaps even controversial foundations. With three main pillars of content, PurMag consists of getting voices heard, talent seen and social norms broken. PurMag is discussing what may not always want to discussed, seeing what might not always want to be seen, fighting for what you believe in, thinking about things from new angles, and paying attention to those not always being heard. PurMag is free speech; liberal and enlightened. PurMag is a community, a collective, a movement for change, a safe space for discussion, and a platform for projection. We hope you believe in the change that PurMag could make as much as PurNoir and its community does and the immense impact contributing, promoting, and getting involved would have on individuals around the world, providing a voice to the voiceless.</p><h3>The Goal</h3><p>PurNoir needs to sell 5,000 physical copies, or raise £60,000 for such an ambitious endeavour to become a reality. This money will go straight, and only, towards the printing and distribution of the physical print. This is why we have set up several different discounted ways to buy and subscribe to PurMag, plus a few fun extras. If our goals are not met, we will get in contact with all of our contributors and inform them of what we can do to progress with this idea, but no matter what, products will always be provided. By contributing to the project you are not only funding a magazine but the entire ground works for thousands of magazines for thousands of months to come. If £60,000 isn't reached our passion isn't going away! We will continue to create for the audience that believes in us and our idea.</p><h3>The Movement</h3><p>With millions of magazines in circulation around the world, why make a new one? A significant amount of magazines being distributed currently fit into two areas; main stream format with main stream content, and on the other side of the spectrum, niche format with niche content. PurMag is going to be the perfect blend of main stream and niche collaboration by looking like and feeling like magazines you know and see but with experimental content, unique interviews with unique people, artists, and creators, like those generally found in niche magazines. A main difference is we make our content relatable and understandable to the majority, while keeping our photography punchy and powerful. Nothing is off limits with PurMag, we will unbiasedly show what we want, say what we want, and write what we want, with a major focus on giving a platform to those deserving. We want fresh influences, new thought processes, and passionate people to talk about what they believe in. PurMag will be a forum for communication and difference in opinion but more importantly a safe place for where this opinion can be shared and communities can be formed, without the fear of being abused, interrupted, talked over, and ridiculed.</p><h3>The challenges</h3><p>Of course many challenges come along with an idea such as this, and so they should. If change was easy it wouldn't be worth going through. We expect obstacles and challenges along the way but with your help, we can destroy them. Every donation, contribution, and purchase will greatly influence the chances of not only the ease of this project but its overall possibility. Also we would like to emphasise that spreading the word about our campaign will also have an immeasurable effect on the magazine. We can’t ask you enough to share this on social media, in conversation, and at any other opportunities you get.

<p>Hi, my name is Chris. About 3 years ago I took a knock to the
head. One minute I was standing at my desk, next thing I know I’m lying on the
floor. A couple of ambulance rides and a CAT scan or 2 later, I wake up in the
Walton in Liverpool (a specialist head injury unit). I woke up with an idea in
my head which I started writing during my recovery. The book has been put on
hold a few times in the last 3 years due to life (a job, a family, getting

<p>The book is a fantasy fiction novel of about 120k words. As a
young boy, Valiant, with help from Sebastian, was forced to flee his home,
pursued by the dark forces that killed his father and kidnapped his mother.
Valiant and Sebastian were taken in by a man called Konrad, the owner and ring
master of Gessner’s Travelling Circus and Freak Show, an eclectic group of
people who travel the world in 2 huge steam engines. While Valiant struggled to
come to terms with the loss of his parents, Sebastian comes to realise that the
world is a darker place than he could possibly have imagined. </p>

<p>I'm Richard Huntly, one of four authors of the book <i><strong>Dark Days of Horror at Dozier Rapes, Murders, Beatings &amp; Slavery</strong></i>. We endured unspeakably inhumane treatment as child slaves at Dozier during the late 50's and early 60's. Many boys did not survive their time at Dozier. As God saw fit to give us the strength and the will to survive, we each went on to live quiet family lives as adults, but the pain of our Dozier experiences never really left us.</p>
<p>About four years ago, the four of us got together to form the Black Boys at Dozier Reform School organization. We dictated what became our book about what Dozier Reform School did to us. Our words were transcribed, edited, and published.</p>
<p>Writing that book purged us of some of the pain, but the memories will flash back and haunt us as long as we live. That book is our childhood blood, sweat, and tears from working like adult slaves to make Dozier rich while the State of Florida looked the other way. Not long after publication, we discovered that the Createspace account for our book had been created in the name of the person that said she would help us by setting up <i><strong>our </strong></i>account <i><strong>for us</strong></i>. Instead, she set it up in her own name. We didn't know anything about Createspace at the time; we never agreed to her setting up the account in her name and we had no contract with her. She has repeatedly locked us out of the account such that we can't even buy our own books to sell. As if we didn't go through enough by living the childhood slave experience, now we are having to fight for control of our own book.</p>
<p>Life goes on regardless, but we do not want to let our childhood blood, sweat, and tears make this person money while she keep us from using our own book effectively to share our story as we see fit. This is why I started this campaign on behalf of the Black Boys at Dozier Reform School. We are not wealthy men...we need help covering the necessary legal fees so we can fight for control of our book.</p>
<p>We really need your help. If you can't make a donation right now, you can still help by telling your friends and social media contacts about this campaign, and please ask them to help spread the word. We don't have much to offer as Perks for your generosity, but we will gratefully acknowledge you in our next edition of the book once we gain control of it.</p>
<p>Thank you for caring,</p>

As God saw fit to give us the strength and the will to survive, we each went on to live quiet family lives as adults, but the pain of our Dozier experiences never really left us.
About four years ago, the four of us got together to form the Black Boys at Dozier Reform School organization. We dictated what became our book about what Dozier Reform School did to us. Our words were transcribed, edited, and published.
Writing that book purged us of some of the pain, but the memories will flash back and haunt us as long as we live. That book is our childhood blood, sweat, and tears from working like adult slaves to make Dozier rich while the State of Florida looked the other way. Not long after publication, we discovered that the Createspace account for our book had been created in the name of the person that said she would help us by setting up our account for us. Instead, she set it up in her own name. We didn't know anything about Createspace at the time; we never agreed to her setting up the account in her name and we had no contract with her. She has repeatedly locked us out of the account such that we can't even buy our own books to sell. As if we didn't go through enough by living the childhood slave experience, now we are having to fight for control of our own book.
Life goes on regardless, but we do not want to let our childhood blood, sweat, and tears make this person money while she keep us from using our own book effectively to share our story as we see fit. This is why I started this campaign on behalf of the Black Boys at Dozier Reform School. We are not wealthy men...we need help covering the necessary legal fees so we can fight for control of our book.
We really need your help. If you can't make a donation right now, you can still help by telling your friends and social media contacts about this campaign, and please ask them to help spread the word. We don't have much to offer as Perks for your generosity, but we will gratefully acknowledge you in our next edition of the book once we gain control of it.
Thank you for caring,
Richard Huntly, President, Black Boys at Dozier Reform School

<h2><strong>About <i>The Star Kin Chronicles</i>:</strong></h2>
<p>There is a top-secret group of immortals who protect humans from the threats of their hidden 'world-behind-the-world'. They are the Erelim: half-angels with brilliant blood, pure hearts, and a vampire secret. The sunlight gives them their immortality but also reveals their true form. So they must keep their true lives secret. The kindest, purest, and most self-sacrificing of the Erelim can become bonded with fallen Stars. They then become Star Kin.</p>
<p>Their guardians of the Star Kin call themselves Sentinels.  The Sentinels protect the Star Kin, the Stars, and humankind, with their lives. If anything happened to the Stars or their Kin, then good and evil would become unbalanced, and humanity would suffer.</p>
<p>Their existence created the myths and legends we tell our children. Horror stories and folk-tales keep the Erelim hidden behind a veil of fear. No human dares hunt something that is powerful enough to kill them, or terrifying enough to give them nightmares. Fear and disbelief keep humanity from discovering the truth about ghosts, vampires, dragons, shape-shifters, and superheroes. And while a few humans know the Erelim exist, none learn about the Star Kin or their Stars. It has been that way since the Erelim bloodline began.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong><i>The Heart Stone Trilogy - Part 1: Star Kin </i>(Cassie's story)</strong></h3>
<p><i>""My lifetime wish was to become extraordinary.""</i></p>
<p>When shy Cassandra Stone meets gorgeous Alexander Grayson, he captivates her heart. He is gorgeous, charming and mysterious, too. She knows he is out of her league, yet her heart yearns for more than friendship. As they grow closer, strange events pull Cassie deep into the mystery surrounding him. Alex and his sister Amaia are hiding a secret—one which Cassie wants to uncover.</p>
<p>As their friendship transforms into love, Cassie learns she is more important to the Graysons than she ever imagined. As she discovers who the Graysons are—and who she is to them—she must try balancing her human life with her new role as Star Kin.</p>
<p><i>""But extraordinary lives come at a price.""</i></p>
<p>But the Graysons' enemies want to claim Cassie and her Star. Their intentions are evil, so Alex must make a stand. Facing this threat may destroy his relationship with Cassie.  But they must sacrifice everything to protect the life of the first human Star Kin.</p>
<p><i>Will their love be enough to keep the star-crossed pair together?</i></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>The Star Kin and I need your help!</strong></h2>
<p>The <i>Star Kin Chronicles</i> is a Young Adult, Modern Fantasy series of novels.  I have six complete manuscripts, nine partial manuscripts, and ten drafts for further books. I am also preparing several novellas. The first trilogy in the series—<i>The Heart Stone Trilogy—</i>is almost ready for publication. </p>
<p>The <i>Heart Stone Trilogy</i> is made up of <i>Star Kin</i>, <i>Celestial Keeper</i>, and <i>Phoenix Rising</i>. This campaign covers the first book of the trilogy, <i>Star Kin</i>.</p>
<p>I'm here because I need to make my books shine. Getting professional editing and cover design services are first on my list, but well outside my (extremely limited) budget. I also need a personalized website to sell my novels and to enroll in a marketing course provided by an Amazon best-selling author. I need to raise money for these professional services. The details of each are noted below.</p>
<p>I want to organize everything by mid-2018, with <i>Star Kin </i>to be available to buy after that.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>What I Need:</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Donations, contributions, and funds to invest in editing, cover design, website costs, and marketing processes. </strong><br/>As an independent author, the success of my book sales depends on these things. Here's why: </p>
<p><u><strong>Editing: </strong></u></p>
<p>Writing a best-seller is not just about being a great story-teller. To write a book that sells well, you need strong plot lines, smooth flow, great character development, active voice, and correct punctuation and grammar. I created a great story, with acceptable spelling and grammar. However, I need a professional editor to help me polish my prose and fix my flow. I started writing this series 6 years ago, and I'm likely to overlook missing or misplaced words. It's a three-step process: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<i>Manuscript Assessment</i>—for form, flow, storyline, and character development. </li>
<li>
<i>Copy-editing—</i>for sentence structure, grammar, spelling, and punctuation. </li>
<li>
<i>Proofreading</i>—to make sure all the editing has caught everything.</li>
</ol>
<p><i><strong>Expected cost?</strong> Each manuscript could cost between<strong> $1,000 - $2,200 </strong>to complete the entire process.</i><br/> </p>
</div><div>
<p><u><strong>Cover Designs:</strong> </u></p>
<p>Don't believe people who say they don't judge a book by its cover. A professional cover can do wonders for a book's sales. An unprofessional cover can push buyers elsewhere. The cover is the first thing my buyers will see on my Amazon/CreateSpace/Smashwords accounts. If it doesn't look fantastic why should they click to read a sample, or buy?  A cover which meets the expectations of Fantasy, Young Adult, <i>and</i> Romance fans can be tricky to find. <br/>A professionally designed cover can hint at the story inside and attract readers who will love my books. It can make the book recognizable as part of <i>The Star Kin Chronicles</i> series, and as part of <i>The Heart Stone Trilogy</i>.  I asked the cover designer to make an artwork as a perk for this campaign. She has agreed, but this will only happen once enough funds are raised.</p>
<p><i><strong>Expected cost? </strong>For a book cover (eBook and paperback), website and marketing artwork, I expect to pay around <strong>$950.</strong><strong> </strong></i><br/><br/><u><strong>Website costs:</strong>  </u></p>
<p>I'm setting up a free Wix website, but soon I'll need a personalized domain name and the ability to sell books online directly to my site visitors. These options come as part of the upgrade price from Wix. To sell books, get advertising credits, use email marketing, etc. I will need to pay for a business-level hosting plan. So, once my books are ready to upload and sell, I will need the upgraded site.<br/><br/><i><strong>Expected cost? </strong>The business-level plan will be an annual cost of <strong>$198 - $294 per year. </strong>The domain name cost gets included in the hosting plan cost for the first year. After that, I must renew the domain name at<strong> an additional $15 per year.</strong></i></p>
<p><br/><u><strong>Marketing costs:</strong>  </u></p>
<p>I'm new to the marketing arena, so I need marketing skills (and a mentor) to help me succeed. I want to complete an online course (provided by an Amazon and Barnes &amp; Noble best-selling independent author). The course will teach me methods to push my book sales upward, to build my fan-base, and to use the tools available for my benefit.  <br/>Other things to cover will be advertising, print runs (for perks, giveaways, and signing on book tours), and travel expenses (once my books start selling). <br/>I expect that sales revenue will help me cover most of these costs. Right now, I need help to cover the costs of the marketing course.<br/><br/><i><strong>Expected cost? $597. </strong></i><strong> </strong></p>
<p>The income from <i>Star Kin</i>'s sales will go towards costs for upcoming books. Leftover money from this campaign will help with ongoing advertising and website expenses.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>What You Get (Perks and Rewards):</strong></h3>
<p><strong>So, what's in it for you?</strong><br/>I've planned a step-by-step journey to get each book ready for publication. This means I must reach several funding goals to have Star Kin ready for you, my amazing donors. </p>
<p>If this campaign succeeds, I'll run further campaigns as each book reaches editing stage. So, here is my plan, and rewards/perks for helping me reach my goals:</p>
<ul><li>
<strong>Get <i>Star Kin </i>ready for sale. </strong>I will work on the books in order of release, so the sooner I raise funds the sooner each novel in the series will come out. <ul>
<li>
<strong>Goal 1: Editing<br/>I need $2,200 to edit <i>Star Kin</i>. </strong> Once I have this amount, I'll send my manuscript to an editor. If you contribute towards my first goal, your name will go on a ""Special Thanks"" page within the end-pages of the novel, and you will receive a free eBook novella.<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>Goal 2: Cover design &amp; artwork<br/>I need to raise $950 for the cover and marketing artwork for <i>Star Kin</i>. </strong>If I raise <strong>$3,150 total,</strong> to cover the costs of editing and cover art, I will get the cover and marketing artwork underway. If you contribute to my second goal, I will send you a special Star Kin based artwork provided by the artist who designs my covers. Your name will appear on the ""Special Thanks"" page of the novel, and you will receive a free eBook novella.<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>Goal 3: Website <br/>I need to raise $198. This will cover my first year of premium domain usage via Wix (which includes my first year of domain name usage). </strong>If I raise <strong>$3,348 total,</strong> to cover the costs of editing, cover art, and the setup of my website, I will upgrade my website. If you contribute to my third goal, I will create a page on my website to say ""Thank You"" to those who helped me reach my website goal. This perk will give you the option to provide your name, and/or a photo and/or location (if you wish to provide these details). You may use a screen name or choose Anonymous Donor. Your name will appear on the ""Special Thanks"" page of the novel and you will receive a free eBook novella.<br/> </li>

<li>
<strong style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Goal 5: $4,500.00</strong><br/><strong>If my goal exceeds $3,945+ (I'm aiming for $4,500 to cover fees of running this campaign)</strong> I will provide <strong>all</strong> donors with a free Advanced Reader Copy of the eBook version of <i>Star Kin </i>(once editing and cover artwork is complete).<br/> </li>

<h3>The ""Warriors of Rupertern"" saga is:</h3><p>The book ""Warriors of Rupertern Volume 1. The book of demons"" is the first of a long series characterized by its main title ""Warriors of Rupertern"". The book series is about a new world called Rupertern, in which living with rules, species of animals, humans and all kinds of different or similar creatures of the planet earth, as well as beings with powers of all kinds.</p><p><br/></p><h3>Creation time before the first book:</h3><p>In this first book I wanted to be very thorough in every aspect, so it took me four years for the creation. Before I start writing Volume 1, I started for the detailed creation of the world Rupertern, every continent, every kind of new animal that exists. Also detail its history, its creation, the academies that were created and the cities that exist there.</p><p>In case you're wondering, academies of Rupertern are sites of learning for each type of being, from elementary to humans with intelligence, sorcerers, magicians, musicians and even demons, which is what this first book treat, Academy of demons . I also detailed the council, who imposes rules and forces them to comply. I detail enemies of various books, some are just a single volume, but others will be there bothering for quite some time. Finally, I detail the military academy, the greatest of all; I detailed each of the fighters and in the top step are the powerful zodiacals, 12 beings of great power, one for each sign of the chinese zodiac.</p><div><br/></div><h3>The summary of the first book:</h3><div>After being detailing every aspect, such as transportation, various weapons such as swords, scythes and guns, animals and all kinds of living beings in Rupertern, now I went to the creation of this first book, where we have Vind, our protagonist, a normal human, which is brought to that world. I took the idea to take someone normal to that world in this first book, to give us a detailed explanation. That is, if I already started fights and everyone knew how it worked that world, the reader would be confused. That's why I put our normal protagonist so that from his point of view, we can begin to understand this wonderful world and will be the other characters who will explain to him, or rather, to us, on the functioning of that world.<br/>
</div><div>
<p>This first book has about 400 pages and over 130 thousand words. Despite that, I can take a paragraph of the text to see if you like:</p>
<blockquote>""Unfortunately this meeting must end and not the way one would expect, 172 spears tied steel chains out of the water and fell on the beach, three of these through the body of the girl, his blood spreads across the sand, even some blood falls on Vind, who was shocked and motionless at what happened. the body of the woman falls on the sand and is quickly swept into the sea at high speed, as if someone had hunted from within. ""</blockquote>
</div><div><br/></div><h3><b>Feelings in the story and what is to come:</b></h3><div>This story holds many pleasant, cheerful, desperate, intense, terrifying and special moments, which make the reader feel joy, fear, anger, fun, calm, love and sadness, in each of its volumes. For now I just created this first volume and I'm in creating the second, entitled ""Warriors of Rupertern Volume 2. The Book of ignorance"" where we no longer have a normal spectator, for know we will know another academies outside of the demons academy. The explanation of the world recedes into the background, showing new characters and new enemies, solving and raising new doubts. In this first book I inspire me enough to not let readers get bored with long and extensive talks, although it had to be very explicit in explaining of the world Rupertern.<br/>
</div><div><br/></div><h3>Rewards:</h3><div>Thanks to your support, I can meet this first dream I have, that's why it would be very inconsiderate of me to not give you something equivalent to the time and money you contributed, it is why some examples of rewards are:<br/>

</div><h3>La saga ""Guerreros de Rupertern"" trata de:</h3><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>El libro “Guerreros de Rupertern Tomo 1. El libro de los demonios” es el primero de una larga saga caracterizada por su título principal “Guerreros de Rupertern”. La serie de libros trata sobre un mundo nuevo llamado Rupertern, en el cual se viven con reglas, especies de animales, humanos y todo tipo de criaturas distintas o similares a las del planeta tierra, así como seres con poderes de todo tipo. </span></p><p><br/></p><h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">Tiempo de creación antes del primer libro:</span></h3><p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">En este primer libro quise ser muy detallista en cada aspecto, por eso me tomó cuatro años su creación. Antes de empezar a escribir el Tomo 1, comencé por la creación detallada del mundo Rupertern, cada continente, cada especie de animal nuevo que existe. Igualmente detalle su historia, su creación, las academias que se crearon y las ciudades que existen allí.</span></p><br/><p>Por si te estás preguntando, las academias de Rupertern son recintos de aprendizaje para cada tipo de ser, desde elementales hasta humanos con inteligencia, hechiceros, magos, músicos e incluso demonios, que es de lo que trata este primer libro, la academia de demonios. También detallé el consejo, aquel que impone las reglas y las obliga a cumplir. Detalle los enemigos de los distintos libros, algunos son solo de un solo volumen, pero otros estarán allí molestando por bastante tiempo. Por último, detalle la academia militar, la más grande de todas; en ella se detalla cada uno de los luchadores y en el escalón más alto están los poderosos Zodiacales, 12 seres de gran poder, uno por cada signo del zodiaco chino.</p><p><br/></p><h3>El resumen del primer libro:</h3><p>Después de estar detallando cada aspecto, como los medios de transporte, las distintas armas como espadas, guadañas y pistolas, los animales y todo tipo de seres que viven en Rupertern, pasé ahora a la creación de este primer libro, donde tenemos a Vind, nuestro protagonista, un humano normal, el cual es llevado a ese mundo. Adopté la idea de llevar a alguien normal a dicho mundo en este primer libro, para que nos dieran una explicación detallada. Es decir, si comenzaba ya con las peleas y que todos supieran cómo funcionaba dicho mundo, el lector se confundiría. Es por eso que coloque a nuestro normal protagonista para que desde su punto de vista, podamos ir entendiendo este maravilloso mundo y que sean los otros personajes quienes le expliquen a él, o mejor dicho, a nosotros, sobre el funcionamiento de ese mundo. </p><p>Este primer libro tiene aproximadamente 400 páginas y más de 130 mil palabras. A pesar de eso, puedo sacar un párrafo del texto a ver si les gusta:</p><blockquote>
<p>""Lastimosamente
este encuentro debe acabar y no de la forma que uno esperaría, 172 lanzas
atadas a cadenas de acero salieron del agua y cayeron sobre la playa, tres de
estas atraviesan el cuerpo de la muchacha, su sangre se desparrama por toda la
arena, incluso algo de sangre cae encima de Vind, quien quedó impactado e
inmóvil ante lo sucedido. El cuerpo de la mujer cae sobre la arena y es
rápidamente arrastrada dentro del mar a gran velocidad, como si alguien la
hubiera cazado desde dentro.""</p>
<br/>
</blockquote><h3><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Sentimientos en la historia y lo que esta por venir:</span></h3><p>Esta historia alberga muchos gratos, alegres, desesperantes, intensos, terroríficos y especiales momentos, los cuales harán sentir al lector alegría, miedo, ira, diversión, calma, amor y tristeza, en cada uno de sus volúmenes. Por ahora solo he creado este primer volumen y ya estoy en la creación del segundo, titulado “Guerreros de Rupertern Tomo 2. El libro de la ignorancia”, donde ya no tendremos un espectador normal, sino que conoceremos otras academias ajenas a la de demonios y ya la explicación del mundo pasa a segundo plano, mostrando nuevos personajes y nuevos enemigos, resolviendo y planteando nuevas dudas. En este primer libro me inspire bastante en no dejar que los lectores se aburrieran con largas y extensas charlas, a pesar de que tenía que ser muy explícito en la explicación del mundo Rupertern. </p><p></p><div><br/></div><h3>Recompensas:</h3>Gracias a tu apoyo, puedo llegar a cumplir este primer sueño que tengo, es por eso que sería muy desconsiderado de mi parte, no darte algo equivalente al tiempo y dinero aportado por ti, es por eso que algunos ejemplos de recompensas son:<p><br/></p><p></p><ol>

The book series is about a new world called Rupertern, in which living with rules, species of animals, humans and all kinds of different or similar creatures of the planet earth, as well as beings with powers of all kinds.Creation time before the first book:In this first book I wanted to be very thorough in every aspect, so it took me four years for the creation.

I also detailed the council, who imposes rules and forces them to comply. I detail enemies of various books, some are just a single volume, but others will be there bothering for quite some time. Finally, I detail the military academy, the greatest of all; I detailed each of the fighters and in the top step are the powerful zodiacals, 12 beings of great power, one for each sign of the chinese zodiac.The summary of the first book:After being detailing every aspect, such as transportation, various weapons such as swords, scythes and guns, animals and all kinds of living beings in Rupertern, now I went to the creation of this first book, where we have Vind, our protagonist, a normal human, which is brought to that world.

You can have the world map of Rupertern, being able to identify the exact place where the protagonists of each volume are, for that I have taken the time to create each continent (you can see some pictures of it on instagram: https://www.instagram.com/manuelfelipesalazarrojas and facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Guerreros-de-Rupertern-129489207444798/)


I wanted to design each weapon on my own, although it is difficult, it's something I want to do, besides writer, I'm a multimedia engineer, so I'm taking care of modeling each weapon, so that images will be stunning and not only that, but some will be fortunate to have them physically in your hands. It will be smaller in size than the one described in the book, but they can touch them.


Many of these books will be printed, is why that I will make some donations, even for my part, to help planting and forest conservation.


Imagine being able to enter in one of your books, to be someone with impressive skills that exist only in the imagination. The reward of greater monetary value, it is also for me, the greatest reward of all, because you belong to a series of books and be that someone who can die heroically, can fight impressively or can even change a bit the way of story, imagine for a moment that you changed the end of one of your favorite books that you read, here I am giving you a chance to be that someone impressive, in a story like no other.


Petition:I come here to indiegogo to ask for your help, to give life to this story, as this first book in the series is over, still nobody knowing it, I come here for that support I need at this time to continue this great history. Thank you very much.
Why do I need your support?Because with the money I can get here, I can do things that I have currently limited, such as:

La saga ""Guerreros de Rupertern"" trata de:El libro “Guerreros de Rupertern Tomo 1. El libro de los demonios” es el primero de una larga saga caracterizada por su título principal “Guerreros de Rupertern”. La serie de libros trata sobre un mundo nuevo llamado Rupertern, en el cual se viven con reglas, especies de animales, humanos y todo tipo de criaturas distintas o similares a las del planeta tierra, así como seres con poderes de todo tipo. Tiempo de creación antes del primer libro:En este primer libro quise ser muy detallista en cada aspecto, por eso me tomó cuatro años su creación. Antes de empezar a escribir el Tomo 1, comencé por la creación detallada del mundo Rupertern, cada continente, cada especie de animal nuevo que existe. Igualmente detalle su historia, su creación, las academias que se crearon y las ciudades que existen allí.Por si te estás preguntando, las academias de Rupertern son recintos de aprendizaje para cada tipo de ser, desde elementales hasta humanos con inteligencia, hechiceros, magos, músicos e incluso demonios, que es de lo que trata este primer libro, la academia de demonios. También detallé el consejo, aquel que impone las reglas y las obliga a cumplir. Detalle los enemigos de los distintos libros, algunos son solo de un solo volumen, pero otros estarán allí molestando por bastante tiempo. Por último, detalle la academia militar, la más grande de todas; en ella se detalla cada uno de los luchadores y en el escalón más alto están los poderosos Zodiacales, 12 seres de gran poder, uno por cada signo del zodiaco chino.El resumen del primer libro:Después de estar detallando cada aspecto, como los medios de transporte, las distintas armas como espadas, guadañas y pistolas, los animales y todo tipo de seres que viven en Rupertern, pasé ahora a la creación de este primer libro, donde tenemos a Vind, nuestro protagonista, un humano normal, el cual es llevado a ese mundo. Adopté la idea de llevar a alguien normal a dicho mundo en este primer libro, para que nos dieran una explicación detallada. Es decir, si comenzaba ya con las peleas y que todos supieran cómo funcionaba dicho mundo, el lector se confundiría. Es por eso que coloque a nuestro normal protagonista para que desde su punto de vista, podamos ir entendiendo este maravilloso mundo y que sean los otros personajes quienes le expliquen a él, o mejor dicho, a nosotros, sobre el funcionamiento de ese mundo. Este primer libro tiene aproximadamente 400 páginas y más de 130 mil palabras. A pesar de eso, puedo sacar un párrafo del texto a ver si les gusta:
""Lastimosamente
este encuentro debe acabar y no de la forma que uno esperaría, 172 lanzas
atadas a cadenas de acero salieron del agua y cayeron sobre la playa, tres de
estas atraviesan el cuerpo de la muchacha, su sangre se desparrama por toda la
arena, incluso algo de sangre cae encima de Vind, quien quedó impactado e
inmóvil ante lo sucedido. El cuerpo de la mujer cae sobre la arena y es
rápidamente arrastrada dentro del mar a gran velocidad, como si alguien la
hubiera cazado desde dentro.""

Sentimientos en la historia y lo que esta por venir:Esta historia alberga muchos gratos, alegres, desesperantes, intensos, terroríficos y especiales momentos, los cuales harán sentir al lector alegría, miedo, ira, diversión, calma, amor y tristeza, en cada uno de sus volúmenes. Por ahora solo he creado este primer volumen y ya estoy en la creación del segundo, titulado “Guerreros de Rupertern Tomo 2. El libro de la ignorancia”, donde ya no tendremos un espectador normal, sino que conoceremos otras academias ajenas a la de demonios y ya la explicación del mundo pasa a segundo plano, mostrando nuevos personajes y nuevos enemigos, resolviendo y planteando nuevas dudas. En este primer libro me inspire bastante en no dejar que los lectores se aburrieran con largas y extensas charlas, a pesar de que tenía que ser muy explícito en la explicación del mundo Rupertern. Recompensas:Gracias a tu apoyo, puedo llegar a cumplir este primer sueño que tengo, es por eso que sería muy desconsiderado de mi parte, no darte algo equivalente al tiempo y dinero aportado por ti, es por eso que algunos ejemplos de recompensas son:

Para aquellos quienes me puedan ayudar con pequeñas cantidades de dinero, les tengo preparados algunos capítulos de este primer libro, para que puedan sumergirse un poco en esta maravillosa historia.


Quiero tratar a todos por igual, es por eso que el envío es gratis a cualquier parte del mundo, para que todos puedan disfrutar de la misma forma esta maravillosa historia.


El libro que saldrá a la venta en español e ingles será ""Guerreros de Rupertern Tomo 1. El libro de los demonios"", pero aparte de él y para aquellas personas que me apoyen, les enviare dicho libro en formato digital y/o físico, así como también el envío digital y/o físico de los libros exclusivos de las armas y los animales de Rupertern, los cuales albergan una parte de lo que compone el grandioso mundo Rupertern y que no estarán en un futuro cercano a la venta (puedes ver el desarrollo e ilustración de las distintas armas y animales en las redes sociales como... instagram: https://www.instagram.com/manuelfelipesalazarrojas twitter: @librosmanu  facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Guerreros-de-Rupertern-129489207444798/).


Podrás tener el mapamundi de Rupertern, siendo capaz de identificar el lugar exacto donde están los protagonistas de cada tomo, para ello me he tomado el tiempo en crear cada continente (puedes ver algunas imágenes de ello en instagram: https://www.instagram.com/manuelfelipesalazarrojas y facebook: https://www.facebook.com/Guerreros-de-Rupertern-129489207444798/)


Quise diseñar cada arma por mi cuenta, aunque sea algo difícil, es algo que quiero hacer, a parte de escritor, soy ingeniero multimedia, así que me estoy encargando de modelar cada arma, para que las imágenes sean impresionantes y no solo eso, sino que algunos serán los afortunados en tenerlas físicamente en sus manos. Estarán a un menor tamaño que el descrito en el libro, pero podrán tocarlas.


Muchos de estos libros serán impresos, es por eso que algunas donaciones, incluso por mi parte, será la de ayudar a la siembra y conservación de bosques.


Imagínate poder entrar en uno de tus libros, poder ser alguien con habilidades impresionantes que solo existen en la imaginación. La recompensa de mayor valor monetario, es igualmente para mi, la mayor recompensa de todas, porque puedes pertenecer a una saga de libros y ser ese alguien que puede morir heroicamente, puede pelear de forma impresionante o incluso puede cambiar un poco el camino de la historia, imagínate por un momento haber cambiado el final de uno de tus libros favoritos que leíste, aquí te estoy dando la oportunidad de ser ese alguien impresionante, en una historia como ninguna otra.

Petición:Vengo aquí a indiegogo a pedir tu ayuda, para poder darle vida a esta historia, ya que este primer libro de la saga está terminado, pero aún siguen sin conocerlo, vengo aquí por ese apoyo que necesito en este momento, para poder continuar esta grandiosa historia. Muchas gracias.¿Por qué necesito de tú apoyo?Porque con el dinero que puedo obtener aquí, puedo hacer cosas que actualmente tengo limitado, tales como:

La publicación a nivel mundial tanto online como físico del libro en los dos idiomas.


Dar publicidad al libro, de modo que más gente conozca esta maravillosa historia.


Ilustraciones a color de los animales y las armas del mundo Rupertern.


Donaciones para la conservación del medio ambiente.


Que no sea solo yo, el único interesado en continuar la historia.

Dar más publicidad al libro, tanto en redes sociales como en otros medios de comunicación.


Mayor cantidad de donaciones al medio ambiente.


Una ayuda para que el segundo libro tenga una base en que sostenerse y así sucesivamente cada nuevo tomo.


Más ilustraciones, tanto para este primer libro como para el segundo.

<h3>According to The Veterinary Cancer Society, cancer is the leading cause of death in <strong>47% of dogs</strong>.</h3>
<p>There is exciting research that the Ketogenic Diet can have significant benefit to the lives of dogs diagnosed with cancer.  Promising studies and practical experiences shows <strong>cancer can be prevented, stopped, or even reversed.</strong></p>
<h3>As far back as 1921 Dr. R.M. Wilder theorized that the Ketogenic Diet was a way of starving cancer cells.</h3>
<p>The Keto Pet Sanctuary is a rescue center for dogs with cancer and is producing outstanding results. They put these cancer stricken dogs on the Keto diet and when they are healed, place them for adoption.</p>
<p><strong>They have 3 years of research saying the Keto diet works for dogs.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Just this weekend Dr. Mercola published an interview with Dr. Ian Billingham who pointed out the connection between a dog's diet and cancer.</strong></p>
<p><i>""We vets are a very conservative profession. We are the most conservative profession I know. We are so tied up in our beliefs about nutrition. Our belief about nutrition is that processed pet food is the only way to feed pets.</i></p>
<p><i>Isn't it terrible that we have this belief? This is how our profession works. It believes that processed pet food is the only way to feed pets. Yet, processed pet food, based as it is on carbohydrates, actually drives cancer.""</i></p>
<p><i>""All our veterinary schools are funded by the major pet food companies,"" he continues. ""Our vets come out fully believing in processed pet food as the only way to feed pets.""</i></p>

<p>Your dog depends on you, looks up to you and trusts you to provide not just for his basic needs of food and water, but for everything.</p>
<p>Your dog wants direction from you - even if half the time he doesn’t seem to listen.</p>
<p>Your dog wants to comfort you when you’re down.</p>
<p>Your dog is always ready for what you want and is willing to walk excitedly, eyes glued to your every move, when you’re on the go.</p>
<p>Your dog tells you all she can by following you everywhere, wagging her long tail (or short stump!), and looking up at you with those irresistible puppy dog eyes.</p>
<p>But there are some things your dog may hide from you, and no, it’s not just their favorite bone in the sofa cushions!</p>
<p>When our precious best friends are in pain, they often hide it from us.</p>
<p>Our dogs literally can’t stand up on their hind legs, wave a paw to get our attention and say, “Hey Lady (or Dude), I’m in pain.”</p>

These led to the birth of the registered brand, Dogalov, in 2016.With your contribution, we will spread the awareness of responsible pet guardianship across Africa, beginning with our country, Nigeria, letting people know that pet ownership is a careful, deliberate decision that affects an entire family thus, choosing the right pet for the family profile and each member of the family, contributing to the growth and discipline of the pet.With your contribution, we would develop a secured online platform for sales of subsequent editions, increase our online/ offline marketing and print hard copy for circulation nationwide (Nigeria only), till we gain leverage for large scale advertisement and sales revenue.It is often heard in different parts of Nigeria (and maybe, Africa), how a dog bit the owner, owner’s child, family or friend. Many times, the training or other factors surrounding the development of such a dog for example, vaccination was neglected, turning such a pet into a beast.Beyond the magazine, we have set up Dogalov school club, in a Montessori school in Abuja, Nigeria, where we teach children aged 5 – 11, the basic care of animals, pro bono. We are hoping to replicate the club in some more schools.If Africans can successfully inculcate the awareness of responsible pet guardianship, we would have a continent with fewer human or animal lives being lost due to poor pet parenting.The maiden edition was due by January 10th 2017 but is now in production, due to limited funding. We hope to raise the required funds through this crowdfunding campaign to make the process less burdensome. Else, we would keep pushing our baby steps till we achieve this dream.If you’re disposed to help us fund this campaign, great!!! We appreciate. If you are not, the next best tool available, is your network. Help us get this message out to your network by sharing our campaign, using the Indiegogo share tools, and together, we can ensure the safety of human lives and animals in Africa while helping us fulfill our vision: enriching human lives through pets.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

I'm Shairina Brown, and I'm the author of The Divine Chronicles. I am currently a student studying English Literature and Storytelling; I’ve written tons of stories in the past, and I’ve been published in various anthologies and literary magazines. I started writing The Divine Chronicles three years ago, and it's easily my biggest project. I've spent months fleshing out the world it takes place in, and putting my school assignments off 'til the last minute so I could create something I was proud of. I'm happy to say that I've finally reached that point, and thus I present The Divine Chronicles to you.<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1347032/files/20150401134619-TheStory.png?1427921179"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The Divine Chronicles is my take on a YA urban-fantasy series and it is focused on queer and racial minorities as major characters. This series aims to be representation for readers of colour, queer readers, and those who intersect between the two. This series is for those who are forced to consume media without seeing themselves reflected in the story and live with the idea that they aren't worth telling stories about. Growing up, all I wanted was stories that I could see myself in and for this reason I’ve created a world inspired from our very own where POC aren’t a dime a dozen; where not all POC are struggling with racism or prejudice; where not all coming out stories are met with intolerance, fear, and ignorance. The Divine Chronicles serves as a story where minorities are represented together in a story filled with wonder, magic, and action.</span><br/></p><p>While this crowdfunding campaign is in support of The Divine Chronicles in general, I am trying to start out rather slow with introductions to the characters. If this project gets fully funded, the first physical book received by supporters will be <i style=""font-weight: bold;"">The Sentinel Chronicles Volume A: Crownes</i>.<i style=""font-weight: bold;""> </i></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">This book is an anthology filled with three-thousand to four-thousand word stories about the eight main characters who are all reborn gods. These stories take place when the characters are around ten to fourteen years of age, and they show us some of the life changing and important events that went on in the casts lives prior to the very first novel.</span></p><br/>

<p>Thank you to Bunpurr, who you can find on deviantart. She's been so great to work with, and she's been extremely helpful as well!

</div>
</div>","CHECK OUT TDC'S OFFICIAL TUMBLR HERE FOR ALL NEW UPDATES!Hello! I'm Shairina Brown, and I'm the author of The Divine Chronicles. I am currently a student studying English Literature and Storytelling; I’ve written tons of stories in the past, and I’ve been published in various anthologies and literary magazines. I started writing The Divine Chronicles three years ago, and it's easily my biggest project. I've spent months fleshing out the world it takes place in, and putting my school assignments off 'til the last minute so I could create something I was proud of. I'm happy to say that I've finally reached that point, and thus I present The Divine Chronicles to you.
The Divine Chronicles is my take on a YA urban-fantasy series and it is focused on queer and racial minorities as major characters. This series aims to be representation for readers of colour, queer readers, and those who intersect between the two. This series is for those who are forced to consume media without seeing themselves reflected in the story and live with the idea that they aren't worth telling stories about. Growing up, all I wanted was stories that I could see myself in and for this reason I’ve created a world inspired from our very own where POC aren’t a dime a dozen; where not all POC are struggling with racism or prejudice; where not all coming out stories are met with intolerance, fear, and ignorance. The Divine Chronicles serves as a story where minorities are represented together in a story filled with wonder, magic, and action.While this crowdfunding campaign is in support of The Divine Chronicles in general, I am trying to start out rather slow with introductions to the characters. If this project gets fully funded, the first physical book received by supporters will be The Sentinel Chronicles Volume A: Crownes. This book is an anthology filled with three-thousand to four-thousand word stories about the eight main characters who are all reborn gods. These stories take place when the characters are around ten to fourteen years of age, and they show us some of the life changing and important events that went on in the casts lives prior to the very first novel.

Soft cover
Anthology of short stories following the eight main characters
160+ pages
5"" x 8"" 
Bonus content after the last short story
Current progress: All short stories are finished and are currently going through the editing and revising process. Once they're done, I'll be prepping them for print, and then send off to the printer I've been in contact with! The bonus content will be worked on while I'm in the editing and revising process for the main content. 

Things needed to be done: front cover illustration / design

The official art for The Divine Chronicles is drawn Bunpurr on Devianart. We've been working together since Fall 2014, and  you can find some of the work she's done for the project down below.

<p>Hello everybody.</p>
<p>My name is, Phil Newton, author of fan favorite If You Give a Guy a Beer…it’s a parody. I’m also author of the soon to be published If You Give a Guy a Fishing Rod. </p>
<p>But wait, you see this all begins with a story. </p>
<p>6 years ago I was out of work for several months.  <br/>I know unemployment is sad…I got better.</p>
<p>As I looked for employment, I thought I should keep myself busy with a creative endeavor.<br/>That creative endeavor was a humor book, a parody of the popular children’s book If You Give a Mouse a Cookie. It's called, If You Give A Guy a Beer.</p>
<p>Well I found a job, but the funny thing is the book has continued to sell. Only one or two copies a day, but that’s been enough to push it past the 1000 copies sold mark! And I kinda' made a deal with myself. If it sells more than 1000 copies then I will write another and see how it goes.</p>
<p>So, I went on a quest to find a great artist worthy of illustrating my next masterpiece…lexicon…volume…ok Bathroom Reader. </p>
<p>It serves an important function!</p>
<p>Anyway, I found a great artist, Tom Heyerman.</p>
<p>Now, this is where you enter the story. </p>
<p>My artist deserves to be paid for his excellent work. I’m sure you agree. </p>
<p>My goal of $6,000 will go to paying him. The rest will go to fulfillment of If You Give a Guy A Fishing Rod. Anything that is left will go toward buying me a ham sandwich. I do love ham sandwiches. I hope I get more than one.</p>
<h3>I Have Included Several Perks.</h3>
<p>You have the option of receiving:</p>
<ul>
<li>My eternal thanks and a Desktop Background featuring art from If You Give a Guy A Fishing Rod.</li>
<li>If You Give a Guy a Fishing rod eBook (plus the above).</li>
<li>A signed physical copy of If You Give a Guy a Fishing Rod and eBook.</li>
<li>Signed physical copies of If You Give a Guy a Fishing Rod, my previous book: If You Give Guy A Beer, and eBook.</li>
<li>Signed physical copies of If You Give a Guy a Fishing Rod, my previous book: If You Give Guy A Beer (Regular cover and variant cover), eBook, and limited edition poster of guy and his friends. Limited to 25 copies! eBook and my previous book, If You Give Guy A Beer (both signed).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I understand that some of you just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help:</p>

</div><p>I am writing a book. Not just any book. Not a fictional book. Not a self-help book--but a book to help people revolt against the cultural and societal strains that self-help books and culture in general create and overcome their fear that they're not good enough, can't overcome their situation, or aren't able to be loved. They can throw out all the garbage that rains down daily on us all and overcome the stress and self esteem issues that plague them, once they realize that they can truly move forward and that there is a Creator who has a purpose for them.</p><p>     Here's where you come in! I would love for this book to be published by big name, like Thomas Nelson or Baker, but unfortunately, when that happens, the price of the books become astronomical and the readers are only those who can afford to purchase the books. But, if I self-publish, I maintain the rights to the book and am able to do with it what  I choose. So if I want to sell it on Amazon for a penny or give it away/sell it for charity, I can do all of those things. However, self-publishing isn't cheap. The only way to get the book out to the right places is to go with a larger publishing house, like Westbow Press. To do so, effectively, costs an author anywhere from $3,200-$17,000, up front, with no guaranteed return on that investment. However, the return isn't my issue, it's the initial cost. I could care less about actually making money, I just want to help people. </p><p>      What I am asking: please give what you can, every dollar that you give will go toward the cost to publish. The more I can raise, the more exposure the book will have in book stores and electronically. </p><p>       MY PROMISE: If I end up raising more than I need to publish and market, I will give the money to another charity here locally or one that you designate, such as a church and/or pregnancy crisis center, dependent on the total amount left over. Either way, if we get enough funding I hope to be able to hand sign with a unique message a book for every contributor here who indicates, when asked, that they would like one. I think that would be a nice thank you. Either way, I appreciate your time in just reading this and hope you the best!</p><p><br/></p><p>*NOTE*: As with all publishing, the dates are fluid, the book will be completed in fall of 2016, however, dependent on editorial review and printer issues, we have given lead time on all perks. We hope it won't take as long as it notes in each of the perks. Thanks so much for your support!</p><p></p></div>","I am writing a book. Not just any book. Not a fictional book.

<h3>Encouraging Future Gearheads</h3>
<p>We are Brian &amp; Clint, a pair of buddies who met because of a shared hobby that has been the source of ours and many other lifelong friendships.  This book is our attempt to help that hobby reach more people for whom it might be the key to a fun, supportive community that isn't based on race or politics and where the only ""religious arguments"" are about drivetrains. </p>
<ul>
<li>We want kids to learn about motorsports as a hobby.</li>
<li>We want to tell stories from both real motorsports and amateur tuners.</li>
<li>We want to raise money for charities that matter to us.</li>
<li>We want a fun story to read with the kids in our lives!</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>You're Into Cars? So Are We!</h3>
<p>It's fun to share your passion with your kids!  Here's a great way to start that early.</p>
<ul>
<li>Real racing terminology.</li>
<li>Genuine stories about real car culture.</li>
<li>Storytellers who love the subject as much as you do and strive to do right by the topic.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>Not A Gearhead?  Still Fun To Read!</h3>
<p>This isn't a technical manual, and you might even learn something you can save for trivia night.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fun, cute characters that your kids will want to hear about.</li>
<li>An uplifting message about virtues such as determination and friendship.</li>
<li>A vivid, full-color hard-cover picture book you can be proud to own or give as a gift.</li>
</ul>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>A Charity Impact In Every Copy!</h3>
<p>One of the things that really motivates us is a chance to give back to the kids our communities.  Since the beginning of this project it's been our goal to contribute as much of it to charity as we could.  There's not a lot of profit in the self-publishing book industry but we are determined to always carve out a significant share to donate to valuable children's health causes from the sale of every story book and sticker pack. </p>
<ol>
<li>From every book sale, $2 of the $10 is set aside for charity</li>
<li>From every sticker sale, $1 of the $3 is set aside</li>
<li>From a combo book+sticker sale, $3 is set aside</li>
</ol>
<p>We are doing this because it's important to us, even if it means sometimes we lose money on a sale.  That's part of being a ""social venture"" business, where supporting our community (not profit) is our primary aim.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>We Need Your Help Self-Publishing!</h3>
<p>As you can imagine, children's book publishing is highly competitive and our approach and desire to donate a significant share to charity meant the only way to release these books is to publish them ourselves, at our own cost.</p>
<ul>
<li>When you pre-order a copy, you help us fund our initial print run!</li>
<li>When you pre-order a copy, we make a donation to a fantastic nonprofit supporting children and their families with bleeding disorders!</li>
</ul>
<p>If we don't reach our goal on Indiegogo we have to find some other way.  Bake sales at track days, maybe?  Does anyone want to buy a brownie that's lightly dusted in shredded tire rubber for 5 dollars... ?</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Not Our First Rodeo</h3>
<p>You can trust that we know how to publish and distribute a high-quality book in a timely manner.  We've done this before!</p>
<ul>
<li>One of us is a professional graphic designer who has done digital-to-print work for clients all over the US, who dreams in Adobe Illustrator, and who can name more fonts than your kids can name Pokemon!</li>
<li>The other one of us is an efficiency nutjob who has run several car clubs, chaired several nonprofit boards, managed many complex corporate projects, and has a wifi-connected egg tray in his fridge because finding he's out of eggs on Sunday morning is just <i>inefficient.</i>
</li>
<li>This is our second book in this series and we're using the same publisher, so the process is known and proven and we can set clear expectations.</li>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Risk are pretty low since we've done all the hard work already! But there are always a few.</p>

<li>The digital book is already created and converted to be ready for printing.</li>
<li>We're using the same 8""x5"" hardcover format as before so layout delays with the printer should be minimal</li>

<p>Canada's main artery, The Trans Canada Highway, stretches from the Atlantic to the Pacific and features some of the most diverse scenery on the planet.</p>
<p>My experience as a driver is significant, not least in North America.  I have driven long distance in Canada and in the southwest part of the USA, often covering 5,000 miles on a 14 day holiday.  The often quiet but easy roads and the huge skies make driving in this part of the world quite rewarding.</p>
<p>To drive the entire Trans Canada Highway (and back again) means 26 days on the road, with two ferries thrown in as well. I start in St John's, Newfoundland and after reaching Victoria, British Columbia, I'll be heading back east again.</p>

The Land Drenched in Tears: East Turkestan Tragedy The Land Drenched in Tears is a moving history of the tumultuous years of modern China under Mao’s rule, witnessed, experienced, and told through the personal lens of an ethnic minority woman, who endured nearly 20 years imprisonment and surveillance regime as a result of her political activism in Xinjiang, or East Turkistan, located in the far west of China. Writing her autobiography as an extraordinary melange of diary and memoir, which oscillates between first-hand narrative and flashback, the author, Söyüngül Chanisheff, traces her unfortunate youth from her university years, when she founded the East Turkistan People’s Party as a result of her anger and frustration with communist China’s devastating mishandling of the socio-economic life of the people of her native land, through her subsequent imprisonment in China’s notorious labour camps as well as under the surveillance regime, to her emigration to Australia. Chanisheff’s autobiography is a rare, detailed, and authentic account of one of the most poignant and most fascinating periods of modern China. It is a microcosmic reflection of the communist regime’s tragic realities presented through the suffering and hope of a young woman who tied her fate to that of her beloved homeland. By boldly exploring hidden territories of modern Chinese history, it not only invites the reader to contemplate the universal topics, such as the relationship between citizen and state as well as between ethnic minority and majority, but also encourages similar stories to be told from our troubled contemporary world.

<p><i>WINTER WINDS DESCEND UPON FÓSTRA, COVERING IT IN BITTER FROST.<br/>THE GOD OF ICE ASSERTS HIS DOMINION OVER ALL LANDS.</i></p>
<p><i>An orc, born a slave, rises from the snow to claim a destiny greater than anything he can possibly imagine.</i></p>
<p><i>The kingdoms of Fóstra are divided by prejudice and petty feuds, leaving them vulnerable to the scheming of darker powers. Children freeze in their mother’s arms, and men die fighting in countless wars. When the one artifact that could save them from this ancient evil is taken, the good races of Fóstra must band together to take it back. But the ancient beliefs are all but forgotten, leaving too few heroes to rise to the realm’s defense. Still, Ruth Ilsallar, prince of Grindall, must try for the sake of all life, for hope may be found in the most unlikely of places. Through blood and ice, every legend has a beginning…</i></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>BRING THIS EPIC DARK FANTASY BOOK FULL OF GRATUITOUS VIOLENCE, LAYERED CHARACTERS, AND CONTEMPTIBLE POLITICAL SCHEMING TO PRINTED LIFE! ONLY THROUGH YOU, IS THIS POSSIBLE!</strong></p>
<p>I, S. R. Mowry, am the author of the Legends of Fóstra series. I've published one book (Saga V: The Silvan Mist) already in my book series--Though you don't have to have read that book to understand this one--so you know I will get the book done. In fact, the book already is done! The <strong>Veil of Stars is 100% complete.</strong> Having gone through over <strong>12 rounds of editing</strong> by professionals and fans, it is a masterpiece, and the physical book quality will be nothing short of exquisite. <strong>I have poured hundreds and HUNDREDS of hours into making sure this book is the best it can be</strong>. THAT IS RIGHT! ONCE FUNDED, THERE WILL BE NO SUPER LONG WAIT TO GET YOUR PERKS LIKE SO MANY OTHER CAMPAIGNS. So help make this high school history teacher's dream of joining the ranks of authors like J. R. R. Tolkien, George R. R. Martin, and R. A. Salvatore.</p>
<p>By backing this project you will receive an amazing book, extra goodies like bookmarks and prints, and help bring my passions to life. The truth is, I LOVE writing fantasy and I love my characters. I love writing stories and developing these fictional people that I've become so attached to. Writing epic combat scenes, emotionally engaging conversations, and thought-provoking circumstances are SO FUN. I know it sounds cliche, but I love doing more than anything else in the world, and I want to share this epic joy with all of you! So, please back this campaign. <strong>Some perks will cost you less than a single meal at Wendy's.</strong></p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
WINTER WINDS DESCEND UPON FÓSTRA, COVERING IT IN BITTER FROST.THE GOD OF ICE ASSERTS HIS DOMINION OVER ALL LANDS.
An orc, born a slave, rises from the snow to claim a destiny greater than anything he can possibly imagine.
The kingdoms of Fóstra are divided by prejudice and petty feuds, leaving them vulnerable to the scheming of darker powers. Children freeze in their mother’s arms, and men die fighting in countless wars. When the one artifact that could save them from this ancient evil is taken, the good races of Fóstra must band together to take it back. But the ancient beliefs are all but forgotten, leaving too few heroes to rise to the realm’s defense. Still, Ruth Ilsallar, prince of Grindall, must try for the sake of all life, for hope may be found in the most unlikely of places. Through blood and ice, every legend has a beginning…
***Chapter Sample*** Keep in mind that this is not the final edit of the chapter sample! https://drive.google.com/file/d/12McotWoJkwDuuh...
BEAR IN MIND THAT NONE OF THE COVER DESIGNS ARE IN THEIR FINAL STAGE YET. THE GRAPHIC DESIGN FEATURED ON COVERS/TEIRS IS NOT THE FINAL DESIGN.

BRING THIS EPIC DARK FANTASY BOOK FULL OF GRATUITOUS VIOLENCE, LAYERED CHARACTERS, AND CONTEMPTIBLE POLITICAL SCHEMING TO PRINTED LIFE! ONLY THROUGH YOU, IS THIS POSSIBLE!
I, S. R. Mowry, am the author of the Legends of Fóstra series. I've published one book (Saga V: The Silvan Mist) already in my book series--Though you don't have to have read that book to understand this one--so you know I will get the book done. In fact, the book already is done! The Veil of Stars is 100% complete. Having gone through over 12 rounds of editing by professionals and fans, it is a masterpiece, and the physical book quality will be nothing short of exquisite. I have poured hundreds and HUNDREDS of hours into making sure this book is the best it can be. THAT IS RIGHT! ONCE FUNDED, THERE WILL BE NO SUPER LONG WAIT TO GET YOUR PERKS LIKE SO MANY OTHER CAMPAIGNS. So help make this high school history teacher's dream of joining the ranks of authors like J. R. R. Tolkien, George R. R. Martin, and R. A. Salvatore.
By backing this project you will receive an amazing book, extra goodies like bookmarks and prints, and help bring my passions to life. The truth is, I LOVE writing fantasy and I love my characters. I love writing stories and developing these fictional people that I've become so attached to. Writing epic combat scenes, emotionally engaging conversations, and thought-provoking circumstances are SO FUN. I know it sounds cliche, but I love doing more than anything else in the world, and I want to share this epic joy with all of you! So, please back this campaign. Some perks will cost you less than a single meal at Wendy's.
Also, there will be two $25 Amazon gift cards that will be awarded to THREE RANDOM BACKERS... so yeah... you could theoretically (potentially) make money off of backing this project.



What We Need & What You Get
Break it down for folks in more detail:
We need a minimum of $3,000 to fund the printing of this book (I will count any money made from our website to this number as well). Anything beyond that (up to $6,000) would help offset the illustration and formatting costs.

<p><i>UPDATE 24 Feb 21: Now that the leather problems have been sorted out at the bindery, we've decided to do one final printing of the <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/manuscript-facsimile-project/x/1789830#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Talhoffer</a> and <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/manuscript-facsimile-fior-di-battaglia/x/1789830#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Fiore</a> facsimiles. That will happen <strong>after</strong> Lecküchner is finished so as not to delay this project. I've added appropriate perks; the price of the Fiore has gone up to $200 to cover the cost of smaller supply orders. (Unlike Kickstarter, there are no perk upgrades on Indiegogo, so you just order these perks in addition to the one you already chose.)</i></p>
<p><i>----</i></p>
<p><i>It's been six months since the launch of the Fiore facsimile campaign, and we plan to do another one every six months going forward.</i></p>
<h3>tl;dr</h3>
<p>We're reproducing the massive (434 page) illustrated manuscript of Hans Lecküchner. This time we're doing two different versions, both of which will have the same high-resolution scans at their original size (207 × 300 mm; ~8 × 12 in).</p>
<ul>
<li>One will be a near-perfect replica of the manuscript, including a half-leather bind with authentic Medieval tooling and exposed beechwood covers, gilded edges on the pages, the exact quire structure of the original, and other such details. This costs <strong>$350</strong>.</li>
<li>The other one is a simplified version that's as inexpensive as I can make it. It will also be a half-leather bind, but without tooling and with linen covered bookboard rather than beech; the pages won't be gilded, the quire structure won't be replicated, and in general it will be a nice book rather than a replica (pretty similar to the Talhoffer we did two years ago). This costs <strong>$200</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>To make this happen, we need to sell a minimum of <strong>100</strong> of the wooden facsimile and <strong>150</strong> of the linen edition (or, I guess, 250 of the wooden one).</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>My name is Michael Chidester. I started HEMA in 2001, and for the past eleven years, I've been leading a project called Wiktenauer. Wiktenauer grew out of a desire to set the text of our fencing manuals free from the page and put it into the hands of fencers. What I'd like to do with this project is different: put the page, and the whole book, into your hands as well. We're going to produce a full facsimile of one of the most important and beautiful 15th century fencing treatises, the <a href=""https://wiktenauer.com/wiki/Kunst_des_Messerfechtens_(Cgm_582)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">copy of Kunst des Messerfechtens</a> held by the Bavarian State Library in historic München, Germany (Cgm 582).</p>
<p>Facsimile is a word that's thrown around a lot, and means different things to different people. What I mean when I use it is a careful reproduction of the entire physical book in detail. In other words, it's a book you can pick up and touch without endangering something priceless, but which will at least half-convince you that you're holding the original.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1612757511/suyxriwcrbpxhp0snlpt.jpg"" src=""""/><br/><i>Comparing the Orbis Pictus facsimile of the Krakow Gladiatoria to the New Haven Gladiatoria manuscript.</i></p>
<p>At various times, I have had the privilege of handling several 15th and 16th century fencing manuscripts, as well as copies of most of the printed fencing manuals published before 1600, and I wish everyone in HEMA could have that same chance. It's a way of connecting to history that's hard to describe.</p>
<p>In 2019, I started producing facsimiles of fencing manuscripts to try to capture at least a small piece of that magic, and give you a sense of what the origin of our fencing reconstruction really is. Each of them is contains lessons about fencing, and also about the cultures and ideas that produced them. So far, we've done the Copenhagen <a href=""https://wiktenauer.com/wiki/Talhoffer_Fechtbuch_(MS_Thott.290.2%C2%BA)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Talhoffer manuscript</a> and the Getty's <a href=""https://wiktenauer.com/wiki/Fior_di_Battaglia_(MS_Ludwig_XV_13)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Fiore manuscript</a>.</p>
<p>Now we're taking on the biggest project yet: <a href=""https://wiktenauer.com/wiki/Johannes_Leck%C3%BCchner"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hans Lecküchner</a>'s masterpiece.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The Lecküchner facsimile will be our most ambitious facsimile yet. The manuscript Cgm 582 contains the most lavish and extensive fencing treatise of the 15th century, and at 217 folia (434 pages), one of the longest treatises in the entire Liechtenauer tradition. It is also a beautiful book, with over four hundred painted illustrations, exposed wooden boards, and gilded page edges.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1612754679/t6hsw36bdkfvp0ak7oq1.png"" src=""""/><br/><i>Cover and foreedge of Cgm 582.</i></p>
<p>We will be turning one again to <a href=""https://www.grimmbindery.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Grimm Book Bindery</a> of Madison, WI to do the actual book construction.</p>
<p>The covers of our facsimile will be made of riftsawn beech, which is the material used almost universally in continental Medieval manuscripts. The leather will be pigskin, which is the typical material for 15th century Germany. (It's been pointed out to me that that might result in religious or ethical problems for some people, so if you don't want to handle pig, please reach out and we'll be sure to bind yours in goat or a synthetic leather substitute.)</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1613499426/da5gulhoh8vok6pkey4a.jpg"" src=""""/><br/><i>Sample boards in oak and beech.</i></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the cover it currently has is not original—it was rebound in the 1960s and the library has no information about what the original cover looked like, except that it was also a half-bind with exposed boards. Medieval half-binds would have blind tooling on the leather, so to replicate that I found another half-leather bind from Nuremberg in 1481, the Folger Shakespeare Library's manuscript <a href=""https://luna.folger.edu/luna/servlet/detail/BINDINGS~1~1~10999~101712"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">INC P700</a>, and we'll be basing the tooling design on that.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1613409473/zeapxzyu19eis79afq56.png"" src=""""/><br/><i>Cover and spine of Folger ms. INC P700.</i></p>
<p>Inside of these wooden covers we'll be printing beautiful high-resolution scans onto cotton rag paper of the correct size (207 × 300 mm; ~8 × 12 in), and built with the same <a href=""https://wiktenauer.com/wiki/Index:Kunst_des_Messerfechtens_(Cgm_582)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">quire structure</a> as the original manuscript. The edges will be gilded like the original, though sadly, no one we've talked to seems to know how to reproduce the <a href=""https://darthkendraresearch.wordpress.com/2020/12/12/more-gold-medieval-gauffering/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">faint pattern etched into the gold</a> on the edges (see above).</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1612756039/xdiztbyilinoilmeamwm.png"" src=""""/><br/><i>Folio 112v from Cgm 582.</i></p>
<p>In the world of manuscript facsimiles, the cheapest entries start at maybe $500, and the expensive ones can cost $20,000 or more. I started these projects with the question of whether they could be made much cheaper.</p>
<p>The <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20170202021442/http://extraordinaryeditions.com/our-books/the-illuminated-fightbook-royal-armouries-manuscript-i33/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ⅰ.33</a> and <a href=""http://orbispictus.pl/en/22,gladiatoria"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Gladiatoria</a> facsimiles (produced by other companies several years ago) cost $800-1500, whereas my Talhoffer facsimile was just $150. With the Fiore, we tried to make an even more exact replica that any of those three, and the price crept up to $175.</p>
<p>For the Lecküchner facsimile, details like wooden covers and special quires—and the plain fact that it's half again as long as Talhoffer and five times as long as Fiore—have driven the cost up much further. The facsimile I just described will cost <strong>$350</strong>.</p>
<p>However, the spirit of the project has always been to put facsimiles into as many hands as possible, so I've worked with the bindery to design a simplified version. This one will do the much simpler tooling seen on the current cover above (5 vertical lines), replace the wooden boards with linen-covered bookboard of the same thickness, and will not attempt to replicate the quire structure or edge gilding.</p>
<p>This will no longer be a replica of the original manuscript, but will still be a nice book and comparable to the Talhoffer facsimile we did two years ago (and, we could argue, is within the range of what rebound Medieval manuscripts sometimes look like). This will cost <strong>$200</strong>.</p>
<p>The Talhoffer project turned into an accidental two-tier scheme when we decided to offer a single parchment covered copy for an extra $200. The Fiore did as well when we added optional gold ink for $170 and edge gilding for $30.</p>
<p>This time we're starting with that end in mind, but in order for this project to be viable, we need to sell at least <strong>250 </strong>copies, of which a minimum of <strong>100 </strong>need to be the wooden book.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Stuff</h3>
<p>First, we're not charging shipping up front. In the last two projects, the shipping market (and shipping costs) changed drastically between the campaign and the actual distribution. This time, we're going to wait until the books are ready and then charge shipping—ideally the postal apocalypse will have ended by then and shipping costs drop again. This will also allow us to offer you a variety of shipping speeds from different services, which Indiegogo doesn't allow.</p>
<p>Second, there will be another companion volume! For the Talhoffer project, we put together a book of research on topics related to Talhoffer, including contributions by seven authors. The Talhoffer companion volume was universally praised, and Bill Grandy (head of VAF's HEMA program) called it the most important HEMA book of the past few years.</p>
<p>For this companion volume, we have ten authors lined up and we're going to try to outdo ourselves. This time we're not going to bundle it as a perk add-on (which confused a lot of people in the Talhoffer campaign). Instead, we'll send you a link where you can purchase it directly when it's ready. Stay tuned for more updates on the contents as the campaign proceeds.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1612758099/mb87bf6sknhe8unfifhu.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Finally, why are we doing this now, when less than half of the Fiore books have shipped? Because this is a giant, complicated logistical machine. All of these books are paid for up-front, so the bindery won't start working on the books until after I have raised the money. In addition, the wood supplier needs at least a month to produce the wooden boards (and also won't start until we have the money), so the bindery can't produce a complete test book until at least a month after the fundraiser ends.</p>
<p>I want to launch two facsimile projects this year, so the second project needs to start in August, and with one month needed to make the covers and about three months to produce the books once I approve the prototype, that means if we want to be done in July we need to start now. Heck, we should have started on February 1st, but working out the details of the inexpensive book delayed us a week.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Most details of the Lecküchner facsimile are based on previous work in the Talhoffer and Fiore facsimiles, so there won't be many surprises. The part we haven't tried before is wooden covers, but the bindery assures me they know how to make it work.</p>
<p>The bigger risk is that we won't get enough orders for the expensive replica books. The quotes from the bindery rely on a minimum of 100 orders of the wooden book and 150 orders of the linen book. If we reach the last day of the campaign without hitting <i>both </i>goals, then no matter how much money we raise, I'm going to have to cancel the campaign and refund everyone's money.</p>
<p>And the pandemic itself remains an issue which makes business unpredictable. The shipping industry is in disarray, and the threat of shutdowns for nonessential businesses (like, say, binderies) has not passed. If the plague flares up again, all timelines are off, we probably won't be able to do a second facsimile this year, and all we can promise is that we'll do our best to get you your books as soon as we can.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute to this project, please spread the word anyway. We received about 400 orders each for the Talhoffer and Fiore facsimiles, so let's see if there are at least that many Liechtenauer enthusiasts out there!</p>

<h3>Praise for the Talhoffer Facsimile</h3>
<p>""The Talhoffer reconstruction that Michael Chidester has spearheaded and produced is nothing short of magnificent. Its quality is quite high and exactly what you would expect for the price, and the experience of paging through a manuscript is invaluable for researchers of fight books. I plan to purchase each edition as they come out, even if the book is outside my typical study, and recommend you do the same.""</p>
<p>~ Jess Finley, author of <i>Medieval Wrestling</i></p>
<p>""As the author and publisher of several translation/editions, there is something uniquely magical about holding an exact facsimile of a 600 year old book, no additions or alterations. Michael has worked hard to bring just that in an affordable edition with his recent Talhoffer, and it is a delight to behold. I am excited to build a collection of all the volumes that follow.""</p>
<p>~ Greg Mele, co-author and editor of the <i>Flowers of Battle</i> series</p>
<p>""It's frickin' amazing. I just spent half an hour drooling over every page... and wishing I had the armor... and the carts!""</p>
<p>~ Jake Norwood, the guy who named Wiktenauer</p>
<p>""Producing a top-quality hand-bound facsimile is a challenging project, but Michael Chidester’s Talhoffer reproduction exceeded my expectations in quality and in the speed of execution, producing extraordinary book for a very low price. I’ll treasure it forever. He was also unusually efficient at keeping his backers informed of the inevitable Corona-related hitches along the way. I am 100% confident in backing his Getty Manuscript facsimile campaign, because I know he can and will deliver.""</p>
<p>~ Guy Windsor, itinerant swordsman and author of many books about Fiore</p>

We're reproducing the massive (434 page) illustrated manuscript of Hans Lecküchner. This time we're doing two different versions, both of which will have the same high-resolution scans at their original size (207 × 300 mm; ~8 × 12 in).

One will be a near-perfect replica of the manuscript, including a half-leather bind with authentic Medieval tooling and exposed beechwood covers, gilded edges on the pages, the exact quire structure of the original, and other such details. This costs $350.
The other one is a simplified version that's as inexpensive as I can make it. It will also be a half-leather bind, but without tooling and with linen covered bookboard rather than beech; the pages won't be gilded, the quire structure won't be replicated, and in general it will be a nice book rather than a replica (pretty similar to the Talhoffer we did two years ago). This costs $200.

To make this happen, we need to sell a minimum of 100 of the wooden facsimile and 150 of the linen edition (or, I guess, 250 of the wooden one).
Background
My name is Michael Chidester. I started HEMA in 2001, and for the past eleven years, I've been leading a project called Wiktenauer. Wiktenauer grew out of a desire to set the text of our fencing manuals free from the page and put it into the hands of fencers. What I'd like to do with this project is different: put the page, and the whole book, into your hands as well. We're going to produce a full facsimile of one of the most important and beautiful 15th century fencing treatises, the copy of Kunst des Messerfechtens held by the Bavarian State Library in historic München, Germany (Cgm 582).
Facsimile is a word that's thrown around a lot, and means different things to different people. What I mean when I use it is a careful reproduction of the entire physical book in detail. In other words, it's a book you can pick up and touch without endangering something priceless, but which will at least half-convince you that you're holding the original.

At various times, I have had the privilege of handling several 15th and 16th century fencing manuscripts, as well as copies of most of the printed fencing manuals published before 1600, and I wish everyone in HEMA could have that same chance. It's a way of connecting to history that's hard to describe.
In 2019, I started producing facsimiles of fencing manuscripts to try to capture at least a small piece of that magic, and give you a sense of what the origin of our fencing reconstruction really is. Each of them is contains lessons about fencing, and also about the cultures and ideas that produced them. So far, we've done the Copenhagen Talhoffer manuscript and the Getty's Fiore manuscript.
Now we're taking on the biggest project yet: Hans Lecküchner's masterpiece.

What We Need & What You Get
The Lecküchner facsimile will be our most ambitious facsimile yet. The manuscript Cgm 582 contains the most lavish and extensive fencing treatise of the 15th century, and at 217 folia (434 pages), one of the longest treatises in the entire Liechtenauer tradition. It is also a beautiful book, with over four hundred painted illustrations, exposed wooden boards, and gilded page edges.

We will be turning one again to Grimm Book Bindery of Madison, WI to do the actual book construction.
The covers of our facsimile will be made of riftsawn beech, which is the material used almost universally in continental Medieval manuscripts. The leather will be pigskin, which is the typical material for 15th century Germany. (It's been pointed out to me that that might result in religious or ethical problems for some people, so if you don't want to handle pig, please reach out and we'll be sure to bind yours in goat or a synthetic leather substitute.)
Sample boards in oak and beech.
Unfortunately, the cover it currently has is not original—it was rebound in the 1960s and the library has no information about what the original cover looked like, except that it was also a half-bind with exposed boards. Medieval half-binds would have blind tooling on the leather, so to replicate that I found another half-leather bind from Nuremberg in 1481, the Folger Shakespeare Library's manuscript INC P700, and we'll be basing the tooling design on that.

Inside of these wooden covers we'll be printing beautiful high-resolution scans onto cotton rag paper of the correct size (207 × 300 mm; ~8 × 12 in), and built with the same quire structure as the original manuscript. The edges will be gilded like the original, though sadly, no one we've talked to seems to know how to reproduce the faint pattern etched into the gold on the edges (see above).

In the world of manuscript facsimiles, the cheapest entries start at maybe $500, and the expensive ones can cost $20,000 or more. I started these projects with the question of whether they could be made much cheaper.
The Ⅰ.33 and Gladiatoria facsimiles (produced by other companies several years ago) cost $800-1500, whereas my Talhoffer facsimile was just $150. With the Fiore, we tried to make an even more exact replica that any of those three, and the price crept up to $175.
For the Lecküchner facsimile, details like wooden covers and special quires—and the plain fact that it's half again as long as Talhoffer and five times as long as Fiore—have driven the cost up much further. The facsimile I just described will cost $350.
However, the spirit of the project has always been to put facsimiles into as many hands as possible, so I've worked with the bindery to design a simplified version. This one will do the much simpler tooling seen on the current cover above (5 vertical lines), replace the wooden boards with linen-covered bookboard of the same thickness, and will not attempt to replicate the quire structure or edge gilding.
This will no longer be a replica of the original manuscript, but will still be a nice book and comparable to the Talhoffer facsimile we did two years ago (and, we could argue, is within the range of what rebound Medieval manuscripts sometimes look like). This will cost $200.
The Talhoffer project turned into an accidental two-tier scheme when we decided to offer a single parchment covered copy for an extra $200. The Fiore did as well when we added optional gold ink for $170 and edge gilding for $30.
This time we're starting with that end in mind, but in order for this project to be viable, we need to sell at least 250 copies, of which a minimum of 100 need to be the wooden book.

Other Stuff
First, we're not charging shipping up front. In the last two projects, the shipping market (and shipping costs) changed drastically between the campaign and the actual distribution. This time, we're going to wait until the books are ready and then charge shipping—ideally the postal apocalypse will have ended by then and shipping costs drop again. This will also allow us to offer you a variety of shipping speeds from different services, which Indiegogo doesn't allow.
Second, there will be another companion volume! For the Talhoffer project, we put together a book of research on topics related to Talhoffer, including contributions by seven authors. The Talhoffer companion volume was universally praised, and Bill Grandy (head of VAF's HEMA program) called it the most important HEMA book of the past few years.
For this companion volume, we have ten authors lined up and we're going to try to outdo ourselves. This time we're not going to bundle it as a perk add-on (which confused a lot of people in the Talhoffer campaign). Instead, we'll send you a link where you can purchase it directly when it's ready. Stay tuned for more updates on the contents as the campaign proceeds.

Finally, why are we doing this now, when less than half of the Fiore books have shipped? Because this is a giant, complicated logistical machine. All of these books are paid for up-front, so the bindery won't start working on the books until after I have raised the money. In addition, the wood supplier needs at least a month to produce the wooden boards (and also won't start until we have the money), so the bindery can't produce a complete test book until at least a month after the fundraiser ends.
I want to launch two facsimile projects this year, so the second project needs to start in August, and with one month needed to make the covers and about three months to produce the books once I approve the prototype, that means if we want to be done in July we need to start now. Heck, we should have started on February 1st, but working out the details of the inexpensive book delayed us a week.

Risks & Challenges
Most details of the Lecküchner facsimile are based on previous work in the Talhoffer and Fiore facsimiles, so there won't be many surprises. The part we haven't tried before is wooden covers, but the bindery assures me they know how to make it work.
The bigger risk is that we won't get enough orders for the expensive replica books. The quotes from the bindery rely on a minimum of 100 orders of the wooden book and 150 orders of the linen book. If we reach the last day of the campaign without hitting both goals, then no matter how much money we raise, I'm going to have to cancel the campaign and refund everyone's money.
And the pandemic itself remains an issue which makes business unpredictable. The shipping industry is in disarray, and the threat of shutdowns for nonessential businesses (like, say, binderies) has not passed. If the plague flares up again, all timelines are off, we probably won't be able to do a second facsimile this year, and all we can promise is that we'll do our best to get you your books as soon as we can.

Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't contribute to this project, please spread the word anyway. We received about 400 orders each for the Talhoffer and Fiore facsimiles, so let's see if there are at least that many Liechtenauer enthusiasts out there!
Please share this campaign with your clubs, with your friends, and on social media!

Praise for the Talhoffer Facsimile
""The Talhoffer reconstruction that Michael Chidester has spearheaded and produced is nothing short of magnificent. Its quality is quite high and exactly what you would expect for the price, and the experience of paging through a manuscript is invaluable for researchers of fight books. I plan to purchase each edition as they come out, even if the book is outside my typical study, and recommend you do the same.""
~ Jess Finley, author of Medieval Wrestling
""As the author and publisher of several translation/editions, there is something uniquely magical about holding an exact facsimile of a 600 year old book, no additions or alterations. Michael has worked hard to bring just that in an affordable edition with his recent Talhoffer, and it is a delight to behold. I am excited to build a collection of all the volumes that follow.""
~ Greg Mele, co-author and editor of the Flowers of Battle series
""It's frickin' amazing. I just spent half an hour drooling over every page... and wishing I had the armor... and the carts!""
~ Jake Norwood, the guy who named Wiktenauer
""Producing a top-quality hand-bound facsimile is a challenging project, but Michael Chidester’s Talhoffer reproduction exceeded my expectations in quality and in the speed of execution, producing extraordinary book for a very low price. I’ll treasure it forever. He was also unusually efficient at keeping his backers informed of the inevitable Corona-related hitches along the way. I am 100% confident in backing his Getty Manuscript facsimile campaign, because I know he can and will deliver.""
