<p>“Circadian” literally means “about a day.” Circadian Rhythms are the body’s internal, natural cycles regulating things like sleep, mood, appetite, metabolism, hormones and temperature, following the 24 hour sleep-wake cycle, repeating and aligning with the Earth’s 24 hr rotation. They are the master biological clocks, taking cues from light and darkness from the eyes, to the center of the brain, which then signals the body’s cells and energy levels to coordinate. All living things follow these rhythms, syncronizing with light and dark, and the planet. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1604037293/lkcauuiykymbov7vtmgb.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Circadian Rhythm begins in the back of the eyes, so it’s a great thing that two of the INTENT® Co-Founders happen to be eye doctors! Dr. Amy and Dr. Tom Czyz have been eye doctors for over twenty years, and know first hand how important it is to be proactive about optimizing health. </p>
<p>Intent’s journey began eighteen months ago, when three founders, Dr. Amy &amp; Dr. Tom Czyz, and Nic Yavelak designed a series of integrated beverages to give our bodies what it needs, when it needs it according to time of day, our Circadian Rhythms. Each ingredient within each formulation was hand selected to do its part. </p>
<p><strong>INTENT is a new, proactive approach to optimizing health, in sync with our bodies and the natural Circadian Rhythms we all share.</strong></p>

</div></div>","“Circadian” literally means “about a day.” Circadian Rhythms are the body’s internal, natural cycles regulating things like sleep, mood, appetite, metabolism, hormones and temperature, following the 24 hour sleep-wake cycle, repeating and aligning with the Earth’s 24 hr rotation. They are the master biological clocks, taking cues from light and darkness from the eyes, to the center of the brain, which then signals the body’s cells and energy levels to coordinate. All living things follow these rhythms, syncronizing with light and dark, and the planet. 

Circadian Rhythm begins in the back of the eyes, so it’s a great thing that two of the INTENT® Co-Founders happen to be eye doctors! Dr. Amy and Dr. Tom Czyz have been eye doctors for over twenty years, and know first hand how important it is to be proactive about optimizing health. 
Intent’s journey began eighteen months ago, when three founders, Dr. Amy & Dr. Tom Czyz, and Nic Yavelak designed a series of integrated beverages to give our bodies what it needs, when it needs it according to time of day, our Circadian Rhythms. Each ingredient within each formulation was hand selected to do its part. 
INTENT is a new, proactive approach to optimizing health, in sync with our bodies and the natural Circadian Rhythms we all share.
 



 

Our flagship Circadian Beverage™ Trio is designed to work together, optimizing each 24-hour sleep-wake cycle.

Do as the Romans do… and the Greeks, Chinese, Egyptians, Mayans, and Babylonians have done since 8,000 years ago! 
Honey has been used for thousands of years for its incredible antioxidant, antibacterial, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, immunity boosting abilities. (Reference 1)
No wonder Honey protects against obesity, diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, high blood sugar and helps decrease blood sugar and improve fat metabolism (Reference 2)
With the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, the strength of our immune systems, ability to fight viruses and upper respiratory infections, and protect our blood vessel endothelial cells from damage is of extreme importance, now more than ever. Honey has protective abilities in these areas, so much that there are Phase 3 Clinical Trials being conducted testing the efficacy of natural Honey for mild COVID-19 infected patients. (Reference 3)
That’s how important Honey is to our health and wellbeing. 
And that’s why all of our clean-label Circadian Beverages are made with organic Clover Honey, giving them a rich, smooth taste, like a spa in a bottle made just for you!


Technically, according to scientists, Adaptogens are herbs from medicinal plants that work throughout the body to manage physical, chemical and biological stress and achieve balance, or homeostasis. (Reference 4) 
The FDA defines Adaptogens as “metabolic regulators that have proved to help in environmental adaptation and to prevent external harms.”  They work within the brain and throughout the body to support and optimize health. 
 

 

Adaptogens do really great things in your body, uniquely to you, to optimize things like energy, mental clarity, mood, boost immunity, physical endurance, heart health, blood sugar, metabolism, manage stress, and achieve balance. (Reference 5) 

Not only can Adaptogenic herbs like Panax Ginseng, Schisandra and Ashwagandha help with weight loss (Reference 6)  boost immunity, increase energy and metabolism and reduce stress, Adaptogens can balance the body’s Circadian Rhythms and the effects when our natural biological clock is out of sync. (Reference 7)
 




Get Up and Stand Up with 30mg natural caffeine from organic Green Coffee Bean, Amla and Panax Ginseng, Vitamin C and B Vitamins for energy, clarity, and an antioxidant boost to start your day off right.
Awaken your senses and capture clarity to set your intentions and mood for the day with adaptogens and micronutrients designed to increase energy slow and steady, avoid the spike and crash, neutralize stress from the start of the day, helping your body attain balance proactively, right from the start! (Reference 8)
Elderberry is, according to the National Institute of Health, an important source of natural antioxidants and prevention of disease (Reference 9). It’s antiviral properties are also efficient, safe, and effective at reducing symptoms of viral infections, like influenza. (Reference 10) 
A powerful Adaptogen, Panax Ginseng helps clear the fog, guiding attention, improving mental accuracy and capacity,  reducing mental errors, and lifting mood. (Reference 11) 
Vitamins B3, B5, B6, and B12 are antioxidants helping cells in your body work, make energy, increase metabolism, support brain activities, and repair DNA. (Reference 12)
Infuse Ayurvedic Amla, a medicinal plant with its benefits dating back thousands of years, for antioxidant, cardio-protection, neuro-protection, anti-inflammatory, immunity boosting, restoration and rejuvenation benefits into your morning. (Reference 13) 
Amla also supports blood throughout your body to nourish tissues , has anti-coagulation properties,  and protects endothelial cells, These cells are the backbone of cardiovascular health, and strengthen our defense against viruses that may attack these cells (Reference 14). Scientists believe COVID-19 damages these cells, increases inflammation and blood coagulation that damages tissues and organs throughout the body. (Reference 15)
“It is well-known that endothelial cell injury can strongly activate the coagulation system via exposure of tissue factor and other pathways. Therefore, COVID-19 infection, aggravating the endothelial dysfunction of patients, generates a detrimental hyper-coagulable state.Jun 20, 2020” (Reference 15)
 




Your body has the power to achieve balance, strength and optimal health as stresses rise in the daily grind, it just needs a little push to help overcome obstacles and reach your peak!
That’s where INTENT® comes in. Break Free, activate and fulfill your daily intentions, by elevating mental clarity, increasing endurance and strength, reducing fatigue and stress, and promoting healthy activities throughout your body. 
Adaptogenic ingredients like Schisandra, Ashwagandha and Ginger combine for powerful, pro health effects on the brain and body to sustain focus and decrease stress levels, prevent lipid/fat accumulation, reduce obesity, and fight infection.
Hypoglycemic, anti-diabetic, antioxidant and immunity strengthening effects are also important factors in our collective pursuit to achieve our best health. (Reference 16) 
During the peak day, Schisandra boosts mental performance, increases resistance to mental exhaustion and fatigue, protects against stress, and enhances attention through positively interacting with the body’s hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) system. (Reference 17)
Schisandra also has great benefits for strengthening endurance, muscle building and athletic performance as an adaptogen increasing recovery after physical load, preserving energy, increasing protein synthesis, and increasing performance, without risks of addiction and adverse side effects that stimulants carry. (Reference 18)
For thousands of years, people have used Ginger for its preventive and therapeutic benefits for ailments from colds to cancer. GI accumulation and anti-nausea benefits, as well as high antioxidant levels,  anti-inflammation, anti-carcinogenic, and oxidation-related stress reduction make Ginger a perfect complement to Break Free during your day. (Reference 19) 
A cornerstone of Ayurvedic healing and wellness, Ashwagandha is known for reducing anxiety, cortisol and stress levels. It promotes calm and enhances wellbeing, bringing balance to mid day to help you reach your goals and intentions. (Reference 20) 
Putting your best face forward takes protection against photo aging and mitochondrial dysfunction, Schisandra has anti-aging benefits and helps get your glow on! (Reference 16)  

 

 
Like exercising a little each day rather than slamming the body all at once on a weekend, a little goes a long way. Honey helps deliver effective micronutrients to reduce unwanted side effects and interactions, which is Intent’s approach to optimal health. Start small and build to master whatever comes your way. 
 




The soothing combination of Chamomile, Valerian Root, and Clover Honey give you that sense of calm you crave as you kick back and unwind, setting the stage for a restful sleep. Safely improving sleep quality with Chamomile (Reference 21) and Valerian Root (Reference 22) and Magnesium (Reference 23), while reducing anxiety and cortisol levels to increase relaxation (Reference 24) is the foundation of a good night and great morning. 
Valerian Root also induces calmness, supports sleep, improves cardiovascular and digestive health, and helps the body fight inflammation and infection. (Reference 25)
Boosting immunity, sleep, metabolism and restoring  that glow with Biotin, lets Night Shift do the work, so you’re ready for tomorrow.

It also comes with a reusable, patent pending pressure-regulating bottle to keep your Bobelo beverage carbonated and cooler for longer. Bobelo is the first ever drink mix to create real carbonation from powdered ingredients. No cartridges or machines necessary. This isn’t your grandma’s alka seltzer, an “effervescent” vitamin packet, or an excessively carbonated drink that burns in all the wrong ways. It’s fresh and smooth carbonation from your pocket, wherever you go!Bobelo reinvents how you hydrate with the first ever patent pending self-carbonating drink mix & reusable bottle.Soda is killing your waistline and sparkling water is dulling your taste buds.

No flavor “hints” or “essences” here-- all natural full flavor and nothing else. Loaded with hydrating electrolytes, healthy ingredients & bursting with flavor from real fruits & botanicals, Bobelo keeps you hydrated wherever life takes you. ZERO waste. ZERO sugar. ZERO guilt. 100% Amazing.As a certified benefit corporation, it is ingrained in our DNA to do good for people and the planet.

We’re also working with Utah-based Recyclops to create our own consumer recycling program to help us achieve zero waste as a company. Whether it’s a bottle or a can, most beverages come in single-use containers. Take a stand against single-use waste with Bobelo’s reusable water bottle and recyclable stick packs. Sodas, sparkling waters, and other carbonated beverages on the market don’t hydrate well because they are either full of unhealthy ingredients or missing key electrolytes.Bobelo takes the chore out of staying hydrated.  Carbonated water is known to reduce sugary soda intake and increase the average American water consumption by 43%.

I loved that I could control what went in it--omitting honey for babies under one, adding an egg for more protein, using all organic ingredients. They were so yummy my husband ate some for dessert while they were still warm and my baby gobbled them up for breakfast the next day. Cleaning up was just as easy as Catrina said.

Generally companies allow 14 days to process shipments through U.S. customs, but there is no guarantee. If the shipment does fall behind in schedule in any part of the process, we will speed up the fulfillment process on our end in order to make up time.

Win win!""                                                                                      Hayley Madler, Registered Nurse, Family Nurse Practitioner student, Mom of 3 boys ""I try to only give my baby organic foods, but I never thought to make my own granola bars because it sounded too fussy. But I was shocked at how easy it was to make my own completely organic bars. I whipped up one batch using what I already had in the pantry after dinner and baked it while baby was in the bath! I loved that I could control what went in it--omitting honey for babies under one, adding an egg for more protein, using all organic ingredients. They were so yummy my husband ate some for dessert while they were still warm and my baby gobbled them up for breakfast the next day. Cleaning up was just as easy as Catrina said. I was super lazy so I left the pan overnight and handwashed it in the morning. I just pushed in the corners of each cavity to get the whole pan extra clean and let it drip dry in the dishwasher. The pan never made it onto its hook...because I made a different bar after lunch!""  Aimee Little, College Professor, New Mom   Todd and I were able to invest a lot of time and energy and a significant amount of money but we realized we could not create a solid launchpad for future business growth on our own which is why we need backers like you. Our goal is raise $10,000 to order the first batch of Granola Bar™ Pans. Getting the pans into consumer's hands is the best way to show everyone how amazing it is.   We expect about $1,000 to go towards processing fees and Indiegogo fees.  $9,000 will go towards manufacturing the minimum batch of 2,000 pans, getting them shipped to AZ and then shipped off to you!  After the Indiegogo campaign is funded and completed, we will continue to sell as many pans as we can! We will use profits from future sales to go towards forming a kitchen bakeware/tools/gadgets business and develop more products. Yes, we absolutely have more product ideas!!!  [Tip: always write your ideas down, do a sketch and keep it in a safe place because maybe tomorrow is the right time for you to launch YOUR product idea!]Here's the timeline:  We have full confidence in our quality design and engineering of the Granola Bar™ Pan, and the reputable manufacturing company we chose has surpassed our expectations in service and quality, so we do not foresee any challenges or risks there. Since the pan is manufactured overseas there is the unknown of how long it will actually take to get through U.S. customs. Generally companies allow 14 days to process shipments through U.S. customs, but there is no guarantee. If the shipment does fall behind in schedule in any part of the process, we will speed up the fulfillment process on our end in order to make up time. If there happens to be more orders than we expected, we will simply order more pans in the production order and shipment. We have direct communication with the manufacturing company and if there are any changes in the timeline we will post an additional update on the campaign page.  A big thanks to JJ with 845a for his experienced videography skills and an extended thanks to his colleagues Andria Lo and stylist Malina Syvoravong for the awesome photos they all worked on together.  Also a heartfelt thanks to Hugo Haselhuhn for designing the product in record timing and being the next puzzle piece in the journey - which leads me to thanking Dave and Joan Hadden for their entrepreneurial expertise, guidance and genuine kindness!  I am in awe of how this all came together!    And finally - Thank YOU for supporting and backing the Granola Bar™ Pan...and reading all the way down to the bottom (I'm impressed!).",32.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Wolf Down Food Truck Project</h3>
<p>My name is Brad Early.  Right now I'm a trucker, but I'm ready to get behind the wheel of an exciting new engine of service for our community.</p>
<p>I've started this campaign to help fund mine and my family's dream to own a mobile food truck and catering business.  We'll be offering an exciting menu of modern takes on classic American favorites - Tacos, sandwiches, burgers and fries.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488130532/xbuiuqqb7swajpr6e4qg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We'll be using fresh ingredients, sourced locally (when available).  Our intention is to provide a vibrant menu while at the same time supporting our community.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488130674/epi48v8akwe2yv5pvbf9.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Once we're on the road, you'll be able to find us all over the Yadkin Valley and our hometown Kings Mountain providing delicious lunches for our friends, family and neighbors!  </p>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
</div><div>
<p>To get this project launched, we've estimated that we need $20,000</p>
<p>These funds will go to the purchase of a fully equipped trailer that can be easily pulled by our current vehicles to anyplace that our fans are feeling hungry</p>
<p>Additionally, these funds will go to the cost of licenses, graphics, inventory and our first month commissary fees </p>
<p><strong>What if we don't meet our goal?  </strong>If we fail to meet our funding goal, we plan to apply the contributions towards a business loan that will close the gap on the funds we need to get started.</p>
<p><strong>What if we surpass our goal?</strong>  If we are are able to raise more than our projected goal we have stretch goals planned.  At the first level we'll be able to afford a professional vinyl wrap for our trailer instead of the graphics package. If we are exceedingly fortunate and exceed our goal even further, then we plan to upgrade from the trailer to a full blown food truck!  (This would be a dream come true and all our contributors would have our eternal gratitude)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Delivery</h3>
<p>Jennifer, from the local delivery service Food Scoot, has agreed to provide home delivery for our menu when we are in her service area!</p>
<p>What's more, you'll be able to use the Food Scoot website to place pickup orders no matter where we're located.  Just let us know what car you're in and we'll run your order to you in no time!</p>
<p>Obviously, this is great for when the weather is bad or for people with handicaps. All you have do is drive to wherever we happen to be set up for that day and you can place, pay and receive your order all from the comfort of your personal vehicle.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<p>Not everybody can contribute financially, and we completely understand.</p>
<p>But, you can still help out!  </p>
<p>Let people know about our project.  Indiegogo has numerous tools to make sharing this page on your social networks incredibly easy.</p>
<p>Talk about this campaign with your friends, family and workplace.  We'll be very grateful for any noise and attention you stir up for us!</p>

What We Need 

To get this project launched, we've estimated that we need $20,000
These funds will go to the purchase of a fully equipped trailer that can be easily pulled by our current vehicles to anyplace that our fans are feeling hungry
Additionally, these funds will go to the cost of licenses, graphics, inventory and our first month commissary fees 
What if we don't meet our goal?  If we fail to meet our funding goal, we plan to apply the contributions towards a business loan that will close the gap on the funds we need to get started.
What if we surpass our goal?  If we are are able to raise more than our projected goal we have stretch goals planned.  At the first level we'll be able to afford a professional vinyl wrap for our trailer instead of the graphics package. If we are exceedingly fortunate and exceed our goal even further, then we plan to upgrade from the trailer to a full blown food truck!  (This would be a dream come true and all our contributors would have our eternal gratitude)

Delivery
Jennifer, from the local delivery service Food Scoot, has agreed to provide home delivery for our menu when we are in her service area!
What's more, you'll be able to use the Food Scoot website to place pickup orders no matter where we're located.  Just let us know what car you're in and we'll run your order to you in no time!
Obviously, this is great for when the weather is bad or for people with handicaps. All you have do is drive to wherever we happen to be set up for that day and you can place, pay and receive your order all from the comfort of your personal vehicle.

We are here to help get our product in to something new and this is in the form of a new unique glass container for our unique flavoured hot sauce.

<br/><strong>Wine Tasting Kits That Hone Your Palate</strong>
</h3>
<p><strong>WHY YOU NEED THIS</strong> - You love wine. It is your passion. You just wish you could go further and learn about new regions, new grape varieties... Or maybe it gets deeper than that... you need to pass a wine certification exam to get ahead in your career, or you want to impress your wine-loving boss. Master the World presents a fun, effective way for you to hone your palate. Six 187ml bottles sent to you in a 100% recyclable kit on a monthly basis with an online site/app that takes you through how to evaluate wine, understand what you're drinking and articulate what you like and what you know. </p>
<p><strong>WHAT YOU GET </strong>- Each kit is a curated selection of six bottles of wine, with a tasting mat and instructions on how to use our site/app to evaluate these wines. Each bottle is 187 ml, which is about 6.3 fluid ounces. You can expect wines that are <strong>benchmark wines</strong> picked by our<strong> panel of Master Sommeliers</strong> (Please see FAQ if you want to dig deeper) that we have re-bottled into these 187ml bottles through an anaerobic (oxygen-free) process to maintain the quality of the wine. These are <i>branded wines, not bulk wines</i> and once you submit your deductions, you will see the full identities of the labels so it will be an open, honest process. To see how the online evaluation tool works, please check out the detailed video below. </p>

<p><strong>""</strong>I think you have a winning idea here. As I have said many times, there needs to be a easier, more affordable, and more specific way to learn to taste wines. You hit the nail on the head.<strong>""<br/><i>- Tristan Kindy-Dyer, Wine Director at Vino Volo, Master of Wine Candidate</i></strong></p>
<p><strong>""</strong>The descriptions and rationale are concise, which is helpful.

<p><strong>""</strong>It’s great to be able to hone your palate on quality, representative wines, curated by a Master!

<p><strong>THE BACK STORY </strong>- ""Master the World"" is an idea that hatched when Master Sommelier Evan Goldstein took a group of U.S. sommeliers to Brazil's wine country. Every morning, he watched a New York City sommelier, studying for the tasting section of a prestigious wine certification exam, ritualistically open a set of six crudely-packed mini wine bottles of wine to blind taste in an effort to train her palate. The wine bottles were packed by a friend back home to help her study. When she finished tasting, she would email home and ask for the wines' identities to check her deductions. It got him thinking; those mini bottles were poured from 750 ml regular-size bottles: How much wine was wasted? How well did the wines hold up in those mini bottles without an industrial-built screw capper to close the samples anaerobically? Did her friend buy ""fair"" wines that were true benchmarks of what master sommeliers would use when testing? Evan has taught about wine to professionals and consumers for decades, written wine books, and reaffirmed that blind tasting is a critical way to learn about wine. But how do we bring that education to life with a well-preserved, well-chosen set of wines?  After a few diligent years, we have figured out a<strong> high-quality production process, subjected it to sensory and lab analyses, jumped through regulatory hoops, created branding and packaging, and developed a wine evaluation tool online</strong> that has morphed into a unique and effective wine education experience: <strong>Master the World</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>INDUSTRY VETERANS YOU CAN INVEST IN</strong> - After running Full Circle Wine Solutions, a successful wine education and events company, for the last ten years, we are launching our new baby, Master the World. </p>
<p><strong>Master Sommelier Evan Goldstein </strong>(who passed his <a href=""https://www.mastersommeliers.org/about"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Court of Master Sommeliers'</a> certification in 1987 - long before ""Somm"" was a movie or Miles dissed Merlot in ""Sideways"") has been in the restaurant and wine industry for 35 years. He has also written numerous books, including Perfect Pairings, Daring Pairings and Wines of South America, published by the University of California Press. With Evan's expertise, we have developed a scoring algorithm for the evaluation tool and created the product's content offerings. In addition to leading the wine selection panels, Evan will record educational videos showcasing different tasting techniques and pro-tips to enhance your wine tasting experience.    </p>

<p><strong>QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE</strong></p>
<p><i>Is this for me?</i><br/>A: Yes!! <strong>If you are a wine professional</strong>, think of this as ""navy seal training"": Our goal is to help you improve your tasting skills by providing curated wine kits that you can test yourself against, and receive immediate feedback on how you fared versus the findings of a panel of Masters. <strong>If you’re a passionate enthusiast</strong>, you will find that these kits help you explore a range of ""classic wines and grapes"" and take out the guesswork about benchmark examples for reference - that’s what we do in our selection process. And whether you taste alone or with friend(s), tasting the wine under the guidance of the scoring methodology provided will undoubtedly better your skills and enjoyment. Whether team-building, having dinner party fun, or prepping yourself professionally, <strong>Master the World is for you.</strong></p>
<p><i>How do you select the wines?</i><br/>A: Our panel, led by Master Sommelier Evan Goldstein, meets and tastes regularly to determine the best examples of wines by grape(s), countries and regions. We evaluate many more samples than you might believe to curate and purchase ""benchmark"" selections to share with you. Rest assured that your experience is our #1 priority and we scrutinize and choose the wines based on their being signature examples of what they are.</p>
<p><i>What if I am not a fast taster?</i><br/>A: This is not a timed exercise, unless you want it to be. We do not expect you to knock out each wine in four to five minutes and are not asking you to do that. Take as much time as you would like or use a timer if you want. It’s our experience that the first wine or two will be slower, but as you become accustomed to the scoring grid, your inputting will speed up. Most people tell us somewhere around 15 minutes per wine is where they start. And know that you can always change your mind until you hit ""submit"". </p>
<p><i>How do you score the wines? </i><br/>A: During our selection process, once a wine has been tasted, and approved, we ""map"" the wine against the same scoring grid that you will use, inputting our observations and findings. When ready, your deductions are scored against our findings. Note that while several elements are absolute (the dryness or sweetness of a wine, its color, or the elements of structure - tannins, acid, alcohol, etc.), others are more open. The three descriptors you may choose for aromas/flavor may come from a slightly larger matrix of terms we have approved. After all, one person’s peach may be another’s nectarine!</p>
<p><i>How do you come up with the descriptive terms for smell and taste?</i><br/>A: The drop-down lists of fruit, floral, oak, spice and other such descriptors were assembled, by category, as an accepted matrix of the most frequently referenced/used terms for each. While inevitably not 100% exhaustive, they are comprehensive, and we trust that you should have no trouble identifying terms to select. If you believe that there are any terms missing from our lists, please let us know. We’ll evaluate and possibly add it to ours. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>RISKS AND CHALLENGES</strong></p>
<p><strong>WHAT'S THE MONEY FOR? </strong>Inventory. Because our cost of goods is high (high quality wines!) we would like to secure subscriptions before going into bottling. We already have a bottler, glass and closure manufacturer lined up in Northern California.</p>
<p><strong>WHY WILL IT TAKE SO LONG TO SHIP?</strong> We are giving ourselves time to get the shipping legalities right. We have the right permits to ship to 13 key states (CA, OR, DC, WY, NV, ID, NM, ND, NE, MO, LA, WV, and VA) and feel confident that we can ship by February 2019. We plan to have fulfillment set up nationally by June 2019 - Our priority states include FL, NY, IL and CO where we are well-connected with retailers and distributors based on our years in the industry. We can also ship internationally, in which case additional shipping charges will apply. The vouchers you get from the PERKS will be redeemable for up to 12 months on our website from the date of issue (Feb 2019 / June 2019). Please note that on Indiegogo, we are offering only vouchers that are redeemable at our store. You have to be 21 years or older to receive the kits and deliveries will require a signature from an adult who is 21 years or older.</p>
<p>We are also building our app (in addition to our working site) and that is scheduled for completion by November 2018 (2-3 months).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>HERE ARE SOME ADDITIONAL PICTURES OF OUR KITS</strong></p>
<p>There are 6 x 187ml bottles in each kit.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>The bottles are screw capped for freshness and convenience - no corkscrews needed. And no, screw caps do not have any bearing on the quality of the wine. These wines are high quality fine wines re-bottled from 750 ml bottles through an anaerobic transfer process. Each wine is selected by our panel of Master Sommeliers to be benchmarks of the regions and varietals they represent.</p>

We are also building our app (in addition to our working site) and that is scheduled for completion by November 2018 (2-3 months).
 
HERE ARE SOME ADDITIONAL PICTURES OF OUR KITS
There are 6 x 187ml bottles in each kit.

 
The bottles are screw capped for freshness and convenience - no corkscrews needed. And no, screw caps do not have any bearing on the quality of the wine. These wines are high quality fine wines re-bottled from 750 ml bottles through an anaerobic transfer process. Each wine is selected by our panel of Master Sommeliers to be benchmarks of the regions and varietals they represent.

 
On our evaluation website, you will be able to find out the identity of each wine once you submit your deductions. However, you can also remove the ""blind tasting"" sleeve on a bottle by pulling on the perforated tab.",7.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3><strong>Our Story </strong></h3>
<p>In 2010, our founder Steffen Johnson, joined the United States Army and shipped from his hometown of Rehoboth, MA to Fort Riley, Kansas. In 2012 Steffen was deployed from Fort Riley, Kansas to serve on an overseas tour in Afghanistan. While pulling guard and having a conversation with one of his buddies, he was asked “what do you want to do after the Army?”. Steffen’s response to this question is what sparked the dream of opening a community-based brewery back in his hometown. Shortly after Steffen’s return he began discussing his dream of going professional with his high school buddy Dan DiRienzo.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Over the following years, Steffen and Dan began to brew and develop recipes while continuing to pursue the dream of one day going commercial with their passion project. After years of searching for the perfect place to call Anawan Brewing Company home, they finally found a place. All the way back in 2012 when Steffen said he wanted “to open a brewery” he had his hometown of Rehoboth, MA in mind as to where he wanted to open. With your help we can bring our dream of over 7 years to fruition in the beautiful, historic town of Rehoboth, MA!</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>Award Winning Beer </strong></h3>
<p>Over the several years that Steffen and Dan have been brewing together they have received multiple medals, awards, and recognition for their quality handcrafted beers. With over 75+ unique beer recipes there is bound to be a beer that everyone can enjoy. ABC is committed to their motto of being “Independent, Handcrafted, and Local”.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>From Homebrewing to Commercial </strong></h3>
<p>While homebrewing out of our garage has been fun, we are unable to get the beer out to the public. This campaign will allow us to gather the funds allowing us to open a 2000 square foot brewery and taproom in Rehoboth, MA. We believe through the help of supporters like you we will be able to put Rehoboth on the map as a craft beer destination for years to come.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>Community-Based Brewery </strong></h3>
<p>The Rehoboth taproom will not only be a place for customers to enjoy beer on-site or to go, but it will be an asset to the town as well. From the beginning of our dream we always stood by the saying of having what we call a “community-based brewery’. To us a community-based brewery is one that will support local business and organizations all through the love of craft beer. We are dedicated to having a positive impact on the community and staying true to our motto of being “Independent, Handcrafted and Local”.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>Opening Rehoboth’s first brewery and taproom has proven to be no small task, but with your help we can finally make our dreams a reality! Our $25,000+ goal is what we'll need to begin interior construction on our taproom and purchase bigger brewing equipment so we can offer the highest quality beer possible this Spring 2020. </p>
<p>We greatly appreciate your contributions and will be offering a bunch of great rewards as token of our appreciation. The perks we will be offering are as follows:</p>
<p>- Stickers<br/>- Pint Glasses<br/>- T-Shirts<br/>- Sweatshirts<br/>- Merch bundles<br/>- Barn Raisers Club Membership<br/>- Mug Club Membership<br/>- ""Golden Growler"" Club Membership<br/>- Brew and Name a Beer Party<br/>- Ultimate Founders Party Bundle</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Your Impact</strong></h3>
<p>The past 7 years have all been leading up to this moment. We have tirelessly searched and finally have a place that we believe will be perfect for the brewery and taproom of our dreams. Your contribution to our project represents a unique opportunity to be a part of something special and extremely impactful.</p>
<p>We want to thank you all for checking our campaign out. If you can't contribute, please consider sharing this with your friends, or family to help us spread the word!</p>
<p>We can never thank you all enough for the never-ending support, and we are working tirelessly to get this place built to serve some amazing beer as soon as possible! Please don't hesitate to contact us with any questions you may have.</p>

<p>We're Barber's Farm Distillery, makers of 1857 Spirits.  Our home is on the Barber family farmstead, located in the Schoharie Valley in the northern foothills of the Catskill Mountains.  For over 160 years, and six generations we've called this valley ""home.""  With hands in the soil, and eyes on the horizon, our family has always tried to stay true to our roots while looking toward the future.  What began as a small subsistence homestead, became a commercial dairy, and eventually a 500 acre vegetable farm.  </p>
<p>In August of 2011, our fields, barns and homes were devastated by the muddy flood waters of Hurricane Irene and Super-storm Lee.  As we began to clean ourselves off and to pick ourselves back up, we never stopped thinking about the future.  After three years, a lot of planning, and a good deal of faith, Barber's Farm Distillery was formed.</p>
<h3>The Distillery</h3>
<p>When we first started dreaming up 1857 Potato Vodka, we knew that we wanted to stay true to three simple principles that have guided our family and businesses for many years: keep it simple, do it with quality and do it with integrity.  Around here, we kind of like doing things the old fashioned way.  We like taking our time, doing things by hand, and working hard to get it just right.  At the end of the day, 1857 Potato Vodka is a true expression of these principles.  It is an exceptionally clean and silky smooth spirit.  Rather than using grains in our vodka, we embrace the creamy character of our delicious potatoes.  Instead of blending our alcohol, we cut each and every batch, by hand, at the peak of quality.  The result is uncompromising, smooth sipping, high quality vodka.  </p>
<h3>The Gin!</h3>
<p>After spending the last two seasons perfecting our signature spirit, we are excited to be at the threshold of our next adventure- <strong>1857 Potato Gin</strong>.  Inspired by the fresh flavors grown here on the farm, we've instilled an incredible flavor into this gin.  On the nose, you'll sense refreshing hints of citrus which compliment hallmark juniper accents.  The taste delivers soft floral notes which are accompanied by anise, juniper, and other spices.  There is a satisfying, silky feel to <strong>1857 Potato Gin</strong>, which is met with a fresh, clean finish.  Each sip is a chance to discover something new.  We don't really like to brag, but in this case, we'll make an exception.  It's amazing, and we cannot wait to share it with you.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1511909569/ipqtwirt0zd6vlqr8dtx.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3> The Plan</h3>
<p>In order to bring this gin to market, we need to essentially, replicate our vodka operation, but with specialized gin equipment.  Remember what we said about quality and integrity?  Well a big part of that is ensuring that the gin and vodka equipment stays separate.  We're talking separate stills, separate tanks, bottlers, lines, testing equipment...you get the idea.  Increasing production also requires making some essential modifications to our infrastructure to ensure that we have enough heating and cooling capacity to run the extra equipment.  </p>
<p>Your investment in our campaign will make<strong> 1857 Potato Gin</strong> a reality.  Every dollar means one more bottle to fill, $1,000 means another holding tank, $9,000 is a second cooker, $12,000 means a new still.  When we hit our goal of $40,000, it'll mean that we can all raise up a glass of gin together.  At the end of the campaign we'll be able to purchase the new distilling equipment, bottles, and supplies needed to bring our gin to market this year.  Each donation gets us a step closer to this goal.  Exceeding it will pave the way toward expansion into a variety of other products currently in early development!</p>
<h3>The Perks</h3>
<p>As a way of showing our appreciation for your support, we'd love to offer you some fun perks and the opportunity to take advantage of exclusive, never before offered, opportunities.  We've customized our signature t-shirts to commemorate this occasion and to thank you for helping us grow<strong> 1857 Potato Gin</strong>.  We're also offering a special, behind the scenes look at the distillery with guided tours.   In addition to these limited time tours, we're also excited about our exclusive mixer event which will feature signature cocktails, and tasting of rare, discontinued batches.  Please note: we are unable to sell alcohol online, or through the Inidiegogo website.  Packages including alcohol will include <u>vouchers</u> for the alcohol which purchasers redeem in accordance with the law.  Please contact Ford, our campaign manager with any questions about how or where vouchers can be redeemed.</p>

<p><strong>WELCOME! We're so excited to share POW! Cookies with you.  </strong><br/><br/><strong>WHAT ARE POW! COOKIES™ YOU SAY? </strong><br/><br/>POW! Cookies<strong>™</strong> are not only SCRUMPTIOUS, they’re also vegan, gluten-free, have a low glycemic impact, and are literally packed with nutrition (slow-burning carbohydrates, antioxidants, fiber, Omega 3’s and protein).<br/>Why eat other cookies that will make you sugar crash &amp; burn? Now you can have your cookie &amp; eat it too - while still keeping your Superhero You.</p>

<p><strong>----- ----- ----- ----- -----</strong></p>
<p><strong>We want you to LOVE our cookies and LOVE our company's mission:</strong><br/><br/>1. <strong>Supply the planet</strong> with MELT IN YOUR MOUTH, TASTY, yet healthy, GLUTEN-FREE, VEGAN  cookies. (We do plan on expanding in the future. Already making plans for GFV Raw Granola!)<br/><br/>2. <strong>Foster other small business</strong>, initially GFV cottage food companies through use of our planned quaintly commercial kitchen in our new business home.<br/><br/>3. A percentage of our POW! Cookies business profits will be put aside strictly for <strong>charitable donations</strong> to appropriate organizations and to utilize for the formation of our own, starting with <strong>Bootstraps!<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong><br/>*Did you know 65% of our nation is employed by small businesses? Help start ours and we will be creating more jobs in Los Angeles. Who knows, maybe across the U.S. or even the globe. Let’s think big.*</strong></p>
<p><strong>----- ----- ----- ----- -----</strong></p>
<p><br/><strong>WHY POW!? </strong><br/><br/>We, the <strong>Super Heroines of POW! Cookies<strong>™</strong>, Jennifer Skyler</strong> and <strong>Brittany Jones</strong>, weren't always feeling so... <strong>Super</strong>. <strong>Why?</strong> Because we both have our own Kryptonites that make us sick and bring us down - <strong>GLUTEN</strong> and <strong>DAIRY</strong>. Recently, challenging life circumstances brought us together as roommates. With our excellent X-ray hindsight vision, we now see it was a huge blessing. Frankly, we think the awesomeness of the Universe was conspiring in our favor. Or perhaps Xavior was pulling some strings.<br/><br/>See, <strong>Jennifer Skyler</strong> had long been searching for gluten-free eats that were palate pleasing, healthy and allergen free, but to no avail. The cookies she found were hard, crumbly, dry or just downright awful! No moist, melt-in-the-mouth <strong>GLUTEN-FREE</strong> cookies existed. When at last she decided to make her own confections, the <strong>Pumpkin POW!<strong>™</strong></strong> cookie came into being. Jennifer realized she'd created a <strong>GLUTEN-FREE COOKIE THAT WAS TASTY </strong>- and ACTUALLY GOOD FOR YOU.<br/><br/><strong>Brittany Jones</strong> - newly speaking Veganese and simultaneously experiencing Gluten-Freedom - had also been on the hunt for something tasty that didn’t include the deadly, gas-inducing dairy, eggs and gluten that one typically found in yummy cookies. One day, after Brit had moved into Jen’s dining room, she was hanging in the kitchen while Jen was trying a new recipe. Brit leaned over, added a dash of cayenne, and <strong>POW! Cookies with a KICK<strong>™</strong> </strong>(of spice)<strong> CAME INTO BEING</strong>.</p>
<p>----- ----- ----- ----- -----</p>
<p><br/><strong>WHY POW!,  WHY NOW?</strong><br/><br/><strong>First</strong> of all, we have an <strong>AMAZING PRODUCT</strong> that we believe gluten-free-ers, (the <strong>fasted growing food consumer</strong> market) vegans and omnivores alike will LOVE.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>Current (released) Flavors:</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>HUNKY Monkey<strong>™</strong></strong> - the most seductive of our cookies... Boasts potassium packed bananas, energizing chia seeds, hunks of body-crime fighting young coconut &amp; two antioxidant rich dark chocolates.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>KICK Aztec<strong>™</strong></strong> - Eat your heart out weekend warriors!  Sure to help you keep your fighting spirit up all week long.  Packed with chia seeds, the ultimate energizing, blood sugar stabilizing superfood, 85% Dark Chocolate &amp; a pinch of Cayenne for a spicy finish.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>Pumpkin POW!<strong>™</strong> - </strong>Love pumpkin pie but not what it does to your waistline? Keep your body slim but still satisfy your holiday cravings with the scrumptious, fiber &amp; antioxidant packed Pumpkin POW!!</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>HOT! Betty™</strong>  - Just like grandma used to make... if she made delicious, cold fighting Apple cookies with a KICK of Habanero peppers!</p>
<p><strong>Second,</strong> we have <strong>MULTIPLE CONTACTS IN THE COMMERCIAL FOOD INDUSTRY</strong> (personal connections to both Trader Joe's and Whole Foods, and secondarily to many small healthy food chains, yoga studios, cafes, etc...) Using our personal contacts and Super Heroine charm, we intend to grow our little fledgling POW! Cookies into a nationally recognized and greedily sought after brand of mouth-watering vegan and Certified Gluten-Free baked goods that are <strong>GOOD FOR YOU</strong>.<br/><br/><strong>Third</strong>, and most importantly: <strong>WE WANT TO emPOWer OTHERS SEEKING TO LIVE JOY-FILLED, SUSTAINABLE, HEALTHY LIVES</strong>.  In order to be in a position to help others, WE need a helping hand ourselves. Or to continue with metaphors... We need our help to put on our boot so that we can pull ourselves up by our bootstraps!</p>

A Superheroine Single Mama presently struggling to find enough free-lance writing work to pay the bills, (while those scripts are in development at Mosaic and floating around CAA) Jennifer’s spent the last three years struggling to make a new life in Los Angeles for her &amp; her son while he continued to spend the majority of his time in Portland, OR, with his Grandparents. (Jennifer’s tirelessly supportive, gracious, loving parents.) <br/>Jennifer moved her son to Los Angeles in August 2012, unable to take another day away from him. But that didn’t mean the money poured in to help. It’s still a struggle. She currently receives Cal Fresh and Cal Aid as she receives no child support for her son. Right now, as humbling as it is to admit it, Jennifer and her son would not make it without the state's help, and Jennifer is truly grateful for the financial safety net our government provides. She’s open about the support from the state because she was once so ashamed to ask for help, and believes she should contribute to breaking the stigma around receiving financial assistance from the government. She looks forward to paying it forward, both in her taxes, and by starting a non-for-profit, <strong>BOOTSTRAPS</strong>, which will help single parent families receive grants for starting small, home-run businesses. <br/><br/><strong><img alt=""http://www.powcookies.com/uploads/1/2/6/1/12617017/179583.jpg?226"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.powcookies.com/uploads/1/2/6/1/12617017/179583.jpg?226"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/>Brittany, The extraordinarily gifted Chief Operating Officer of POW!

Britt (or Britt-gyver, as Jennifer fondly calls her) currently works three part-time jobs to cover her basics and put herself through school. She’d POW!

<p><strong>HOW YOU CAN BE A SUPERHERO with POW!</strong><br/><br/><strong>FIRST</strong>, to complete the super tasks we've set out to do, we need a jump of <strong>CAPITAL</strong>. You know, the green stuff. <br/><br/>We are asking for $15,000 to get us started. Thor knows, we could use more. <br/><br/>To rent a commercial kitchen, we have to spend $35 to $70 an hour. <strong>OUCH!</strong> However, with the recent passing of the <strong>California Cottage Food bill</strong>, small home based baking companies will be able to receive permits to operate legally in the state of California. This means more fledgling companies like ours have a chance to start, and incubate for a period of time, before having the financial burden of renting a commercial kitchen.  <br/><br/>So then our first step is moving into a house with a kitchen that meets all of the state’s requirements. A move will cost us about $9000. Yup. That’s first &amp; last month’s rent in a house in Los Feliz (For Reals). See, ultimately, we will SAVE $3,000 or more per month by baking from a home kitchen, but we need to get into the house first. Then there is the cost of licensing, permits, inspection. Then there are materials, marketing &amp; promotions, internet, phone, utilities, gas...<br/><br/>So, <strong>money</strong>. Yah. We need money. As much as you can help us with.

<p><strong>Our goal:</strong> create a line of delicious chocolate milk drinks that fulfill your sweet tooth cravings AND are good for your health - at the same time.</p>
<p>We think real chocolate milk is the best tasting drink out there, plain and simple.<br/><br/>Now, with 17g of protein, 75% less sugar than regular chocolate milk, all natural ingredients, and essential vitamins, our lactose free drinks can be shamelessly chugged any day of the week. It's ridiculously satisfying knowing something that tastes good is actually good for you.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1553540452/zo4ytees6ced9cnbtu1z.jpg"" src=""""/></p> <p><strong>Delicious</strong> - Creating products that taste amazing is our #1 priority. Luckily, using real milk makes this a lot easier! </p>
<p><strong>Lactose Free</strong> - Tummy issues? You’re not alone. All of our milks are lactose free which makes them digestible for the everyday adult.</p>
<p><strong>Less sugar, more protein</strong> - Using a gentle filter, we’re able to remove most of milk's natural sugars and a little of its water.  This also condenses our milk just a tad to increase the amount of natural proteins in each can. </p>
<p>This process, called ultrafiltration, leaves us with a healthier, creamier milk base. </p>

</div></div>","Our goal: create a line of delicious chocolate milk drinks that fulfill your sweet tooth cravings AND are good for your health - at the same time.
We think real chocolate milk is the best tasting drink out there, plain and simple.Now, with 17g of protein, 75% less sugar than regular chocolate milk, all natural ingredients, and essential vitamins, our lactose free drinks can be shamelessly chugged any day of the week. It's ridiculously satisfying knowing something that tastes good is actually good for you. Delicious - Creating products that taste amazing is our #1 priority. Luckily, using real milk makes this a lot easier! 
Lactose Free - Tummy issues? You’re not alone. All of our milks are lactose free which makes them digestible for the everyday adult.
Less sugar, more protein - Using a gentle filter, we’re able to remove most of milk's natural sugars and a little of its water.  This also condenses our milk just a tad to increase the amount of natural proteins in each can. 
This process, called ultrafiltration, leaves us with a healthier, creamier milk base.

<li>
<b>PROTEIN | </b>Crickets have <strong>3</strong><b>x more protein than beef!</b> They are also a complete protein, meaning they contain all the amino acids we need to stay strong and healthy, a rarity for a non-meat food. </li>
<li>
<b>CALCIUM | </b>Crickets have <b>1.5x more calcium than milk!</b> We need calcium not only for strong and healthy bones, but to keep other parts of the body like our muscles and heart healthy too. </li>
<li>
<b>IRON | </b>Crickets have <b>15% more iron than spinach!</b> Without enough iron, we lose energy, as it helps transport oxygen to our lungs and throughout our entire body. </li>
<li>
<b>FIBER |</b> Fiber can help lower cholesterol and prevent diabetes and heart disease. </li>
<li>
<b> OMEGA 3'S | </b>Crickets have <b>as much omega 3's as salmon! </b>Omega 3's help us by known for managing heart disease, arthritis and blood pressure. </li>
<li>
<b>B12 |</b> B12 is a wonder nutrient as it has positive effects on moods, energy, memory, skin and digestion. </li>
<li>
<b>MAGNESIUM |</b> Magnesium helps to quiet the nervous system and prepare your mind and body for sleep. It also regulates muscle and nerve function, blood sugar levels, and blood pressure. </li>
</ul><p>Let's just put this out there - our global meat consumption is a major issue.

We created these designs in-house to convey on a deeper level what the idea of Seek is all about, which is having a sense of curiosity and a respect for nature. The designs are all vintage botanical illustrations that we obsessively sourced of some of the ingredients that are in each of the flours. This is our subtle way of reminding people of food in its natural state and original form. For instance, on our Paleo version, you'll notice a beautiful flower in the top right. That is a flower from the arrowroot plant! So, even though it is the root which is used as the powder (hence its name), you still have these beautiful flowers growing on top. On the pure cricket powder version, we take it back a step further and show alfalfa wheat as that is what the crickets are fed on the farms we source them from, which is the same feed they can be found eating in the wild. </p><div data-id=""21788690""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt=""west Indian arrowroot, arrowroot circa 1816"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1533150961/r1hsl082dvszirvlfcpa.jpg"" src=""""/><figcaption>west Indian arrowroot, arrowroot circa 1816</figcaption></figure></div><div data-id=""21788716""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1533150961/jels15nego8qvc3js4y5.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><p>We have no small ambitions with Seek - we want to bring forth an eating revolution that will be led by a bold subset of the population.

Crickets are one of the oldest and most nutrient dense foods on the planet, and one of the most sustainable ones too. They also have a high bioavailability, meaning our bodies can actually absorb the great nutrients they offer. Cricket are high in the following nutrients:

PROTEIN | Crickets have 3x more protein than beef! They are also a complete protein, meaning they contain all the amino acids we need to stay strong and healthy, a rarity for a non-meat food. 

CALCIUM | Crickets have 1.5x more calcium than milk! We need calcium not only for strong and healthy bones, but to keep other parts of the body like our muscles and heart healthy too. 

IRON | Crickets have 15% more iron than spinach! Without enough iron, we lose energy, as it helps transport oxygen to our lungs and throughout our entire body. 

FIBER | Fiber can help lower cholesterol and prevent diabetes and heart disease. 

 OMEGA 3'S | Crickets have as much omega 3's as salmon! Omega 3's help us by known for managing heart disease, arthritis and blood pressure. 

B12 | B12 is a wonder nutrient as it has positive effects on moods, energy, memory, skin and digestion. 

MAGNESIUM | Magnesium helps to quiet the nervous system and prepare your mind and body for sleep. It also regulates muscle and nerve function, blood sugar levels, and blood pressure. 
Let's just put this out there - our global meat consumption is a major issue. Meat is not only linked to the leading cause of death in America, cardiovascular disease, but it also contributes more greenhouse gases than all transportation combined. Crickets are a smart alternative due to their abundance, efficiency and overall environmentally-friendly profile. Here are some of the statistics:
Crickets use 12x less feed than beef 
Crickets use 14x less land than beef 
Crickets release virtually no greenhouse gases 

Cricket use 15x less water than beef
The main rewards are:

Three new Flour blends (all-purpose, gluten-free, and paleo)
Pure protein powder 

""The Cricket Cookbook"" (available in digital and printed forms)
However, we also offering these special goodies too:  
The Flour Sack Tote | Inspired by vintage flours sacks, we designed this nifty oversized tote! It is made of natural raw uncoated jute with cotton handles. The size is: 17 1/2"" W x 17"" H x 3"" D.​ 
Private Chefs Dinners | This is a once in a lifetime experience to enjoy the culinary talents from one of our chef collaborators in the comfort of your own home! The amazing chefs who are ready to serve up some delicious food for you are: Carolina Santos-Neves, Gabe Kennedy, Malcolm Livingston, and Flannery Klette-Kolton / Lauren Gerie. Seek is a culinary-driven line of healthy foods incorporating sustainable, protein-rich cricket flour. Seek was started to address some of the greatest health and environmental issues, and when we learned about the benefits of crickets after reading a United Nations report, we were hooked! Crickets are not only an ancient protein, and perhaps mankinds first food, but they bring with them a deep and rich culinary tradition. In addition to the undeniably strong nutrition and sustainability benefits, we want everyone to learn about and enjoy the deliciousness they offer too.Since launching, we have happily fed customers from around the world our delicious Snack Bites and Granola, and we've learned a ton along the way. We kept hearing that people wanted to incorporate cricket protein into their center of the plate meals, not just snacks! We also believe in the power, knowledge and pure magic that comes from working with chefs. That is why we partnered with some of the most talented culinary masterminds from around the nation to bring you a brand new line of baking flours.A lot of love and hard work went into what we are bringing you today, and we truly hope you enjoy what we've created!We get a lot of questions about our packaging! We created these designs in-house to convey on a deeper level what the idea of Seek is all about, which is having a sense of curiosity and a respect for nature. The designs are all vintage botanical illustrations that we obsessively sourced of some of the ingredients that are in each of the flours. This is our subtle way of reminding people of food in its natural state and original form. For instance, on our Paleo version, you'll notice a beautiful flower in the top right. That is a flower from the arrowroot plant! So, even though it is the root which is used as the powder (hence its name), you still have these beautiful flowers growing on top. On the pure cricket powder version, we take it back a step further and show alfalfa wheat as that is what the crickets are fed on the farms we source them from, which is the same feed they can be found eating in the wild. west Indian arrowroot, arrowroot circa 1816We have no small ambitions with Seek - we want to bring forth an eating revolution that will be led by a bold subset of the population. As one of our backers, you will be part of the change towards helping us eat and live better. The funds we are raising on Kickstarter will help us: Produce our four flours with a manufacturer so we can meet volume demands and quickly scale across the nation. We will also be spending the extra funds to ensure they are printed in 100% recyclable eco-pouches. Create a beautifully designed cookbook to educate, inspire and empower all of you at home. As we learned from our first shoot, making a cookbook is a true art and there is so much that goes into it. You need to prepare, bake and cook all the dishes, plus hire a studio, photographer, food stylist, source props and bring on a designer, recipe tester and copy editor. To provide the inside scoop, as casually cool as the photos look, each shot takes around 1 - 2 hours to get just right.Team shot after a steamy jam packed day shooting the first images for the cookbookWe are proud to be a member of 1% For The Planet, which means we will be giving 1% of all proceeds to food-focused non-profits close to our heart. Note, due to Kickstarter's policies, 100% of all funds raised on this platform will fund the exact project listed here, however, we will support our non-profit partners in the funds we raise outside of Kickstarter. We are proud to support: Edible Schoolyard NYC | Established in 2010, Edible Schoolyard NYC is a nonprofit organization committed to bringing Alice Waters’ vision to New York City public schools. When Alice Waters, acclaimed restaurateur and food activist, created the Edible Schoolyard Project in Berkeley, California in 1995, she knew the best way to teach children the connections between food, health, and the environment was by integrating an edible education program into our schools’ everyday curriculum.Farms to Orphans | Ensures orphaned and underprivileged children in Africa have a sustainable source of nourishment and access to education. Farms to Orphans builds the agricultural infrastructure needed to farm insects, which are a traditional form of the diet, as well as provide the necessary training to empower a new generation of workers.Little Herds | Based in Austin, Texas, Little Herds seeks to teach the next generation about insects as a resource efficient, nutritious and delicious food through experiential STEAM based programs; family friendly events; public advocacy outreach; and partnerships with educators, universities and other organizations.Wow, as we've been busy working away, so pretty amazing media outlets have noticed!  

2016: The Seek brand launches its snack foods in connection with a NY Magazine feature story


2017: Seek extends its line up to include Cinnamon Almond Crunch granola and starts selling in select retailers across the country. Founder Robyn Shapiro also quits her job to start working full time on Seek.

Jan 2018: To deepen its culinary focus, Robyn decides to launch baking flours as a way to empower chefs to do what they do best - cook delicious tasting foods. Robyn experiments with countless flour variations before landing on the ideal version, which she brings to chef collaborator (and her next door neighbor) Flannery Klette Kolton.

Feb - June 2018: Robyn has dozens of meetings and calls with chefs across the world to build up the team! Robyn selects a cricket farm in Mexico to source the crickets from and Scott finds a co-packer to produce the flours! Meanwhile, the existing Seek product line continues to expands and sales begin in iconic grocer, Dean & Deluca.

July 2018: Seek launches its first Kickstarter!

August 2018: With fresh funding in hand (we hope!), Seek will initiate the flour production! The chefs who haven't yet done so, submit their recipes and the cookbook design and photography continues!  

September 2018: The cookbook is printed and all rewards ship!

2018 and beyond: Seek becomes a household name and people everywhere get to enjoy the delicious, nutritious and sustainable foods that come from crickets!

<h3>What is To Share Brewing Company?</h3>
<p>To Share Brewing Company is an independent neighborhood craft brewery and taproom opening in downtown Manchester, New Hampshire. It will be a place for the community to come together in our shared love of craft beer. The taproom will be a place for organizations to host events and fundraisers. Above all, it will be a place to have fun. You can play shuffleboard, corn hole, or a board game in our game room. Enjoy a pint and a snack while listening to one of our 500+ vinyl records. </p>

<p>We are Jenni &amp; Aaron Share, and we are making the leap and following our dreams by doing something we are passionate about, brewing beer and building our community.</p>
<p>Aaron is originally from the Washington, D.C. area. He began enjoying craft beers in college. However, when he got out of college, drinking craft beer became too expensive so he decided to try making it himself. Now Aaron has 15 years experience home brewing and over the past year has been volunteering at breweries throughout the state to get more experience working with the bigger equipment. </p>
<p>Jenni was born and raised in South Dakota. She made her way to Washington, D.C. after college. Since then, her career has been dedicated to nonprofits and giving back to the community. She is currently leading a project at a local university with the aim to drive down the cost of higher education.</p>
<p>Even though we were born and raised 1,400 miles apart, we managed to find each other at a DC United soccer match in 2008. Aaron was on crutches from a dislocated ankle and Jenni took pity on him.</p>
<p>Since then, we've been inseparable. We share our passion for enjoying and making craft beer. We brew together, travel around the world seeking out the best beers we can find, and now we are taking a leap of faith in starting our dream together. </p>

<h3>About the Brewery</h3>

<p>After moving to New Hampshire in 2013, Manchester has become our home. We knew this was the place the brewery needed to be. After much searching, 720 Union Street is our dream location. Formerly an electronic parts factory in a residential neighborhood, the space gives us the industrial/neighborhood combination we were looking for.</p>
<p>Demolition is complete, we have lined up contractors, and construction has begun. We have even ordered our seven barrel brewhouse, fermentors, and serving tanks. </p>
<p>To Share Brewing Company will bring together the community in our shared love of craft beer. A seven barrel brewery with ten beers on tap where you can enjoy a pint, hang with old friends and meet some new ones over a game or two. To Share Brewing will be a community gathering spot for neighbors near and far.</p>
<p>Once complete, the brewery will be home to ten beers on tap. Five of the taps will serve our core beers, which will always be available like our Russian Imperial Stout, Cream Ale, and of course IPAs. The other five taps will showcase our seasonal releases and our experimental series like sours and single hop IPAs.</p>
<p>To Share Brewing Company is our way of being able to do what we love and commit to a community that has become home to both of us.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>With our shoestring budget (mostly tied up in equipment), your contribution will have a major impact. So far we've put in most of our savings and taken on a chunk of debt in order to get this far. Being strategic and making hard choices has enabled these limited funds to get us through the major construction phase. </p>
<p>To keep build-out costs low, we are doing much of the work ourselves. It will be our blood and sweat in the bar, tables, storage, cold room, and offices. This is where we need you. You contribution will go towards buying wood for tables, games, glassware, and probably a band aid or two. </p>
<p>In return we will give you our all (in addition to the perks). You have our full commitment to making this the neighborhood gathering place that Manchester needs. The brewery will be that hub where locals, visitors, and new comers alike, can come together to get to know each other. It’s where we hope to have the conversations that spark the dreams of the next entrepreneur or local politician, or discussions that lead to enhancements in education and our community. It will also be that place to forget all the things that can weigh you down and just have a pint and some friendly dialogue.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We are not going into this blind. We know the risks that come with starting a business, but we are doing everything we can to understand the risks in front of us and prepare for them.</p>
<p>We know that the craft brewing market in New Hampshire is growing.</p>
<p>We know we can brew great beer, and we know we can build this business.</p>
<p>But transforming a neighborhood into a community is not going to be easy. Getting people to open up to each other can be tough. That’s why we are looking for you to help make the taproom and game room a place where folks want to be. It’s why we want you to put on a To Share T-shirt and schedule your next vacation in New Hampshire for our amazing rivers, mountains, coastline and beer. It’s why we want you to share in this journey with us.</p>

<p>I was doing the Keto diet and couldn’t find any tasty, on-the-go snacks…so I made it myself! FATBAR is 100% plant-based and made without added sugar. We use whole food ingredients like coconut, almond butter, cocoa butter, and chia seed. I’m a foodie at heart and can honestly say it tastes incredible enough that I’m happy putting the name “Dang” on it!</p>

<h2>FAT IS BACK. EMBRACE IT.</h2>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>THE HISTORY OF FAT</h3>

<p>We’re working to bring you 3 flavors of FATBAR - Almond Vanilla, Lemon Matcha, and Cinnamon Chocolate.</p>
<p>But we can’t do it without your help. Support our Indiegogo today and you’ll be the first to receive FATBAR. Your funds will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Help support our first fully scaled production run so we can bring FATBAR to the masses.</li>
<li>Help us get setup online so you'll have access to FATBAR again and again as soon as we finish our first run. Our goal is to enter retail stores by 2019 but we know how difficult it can be for someone to locate their newest, favorite products at their local grocery store.</li>

<h2>Rewards, Risks, Challenges</h2>
<p>We expect to start shipping out rewards as soon as August 20, 2018. While we do not expect delays, there is always a risk our copacker could run into delays due to ingredient sourcing or the need to produce a much larger demand than initially expected. With that said, we are confident FATBAR will ship before the end of September 2018. </p>
<p>We're currently launching FATBAR with 3 flavors: Almond Vanilla, Lemon Matcha, Cinnamon Chocolate. While continue to work on new flavors and formulas to bring more variety to the FATBAR line, there could be a chance that one or all of these flavors are adjusted before our first production run. Flavors for our first run will be finalized before the campaign is over. We will communicate any changes immediately to our backers. For backers whose rewards include single flavor cases, we will reach out at the end of the campaign to find out your flavor selection. </p>

</div></div>","WHY I MADE FATBAR
I was doing the Keto diet and couldn’t find any tasty, on-the-go snacks…so I made it myself! FATBAR is 100% plant-based and made without added sugar. We use whole food ingredients like coconut, almond butter, cocoa butter, and chia seed. I’m a foodie at heart and can honestly say it tastes incredible enough that I’m happy putting the name “Dang” on it!
-Vincent K, Founder FATBAR and Dang



Several popular bars out there boast high protein and minimal ingredients but fall short because most of them are sweetened with dates, honey, maple syrup, or rice syrup. Yes, they've taken away the added cane sugar. Yes, these types of sweeteners have their own health benefits. But when it comes down to it, sugar is sugar, and sugar drives the carb count up no matter the form it comes in.
Lots of other ""keto-friendly"" bars have found ways to bring the net carb count low while keeping the fat and protein high but ruin their ingredient lists with animal fat and sugar alcohols and, to be honest, just taste like $#*!






After messing around in the kitchen using real, keto-friendly ingredients like cocoa butter, coconut, and almond butter, Vincent came up with…FATBAR!
FATBAR is completely plant-based, and has ideal macronutrients for a high fat, moderate protein, low carb keto diet: 70% fat, 20% protein, and 10% net carbs.
And because we’re food people first rather than nutrition people, they taste Dang good!



FLAVORS



 
INTENTIONAL INGREDIENTS, SUSTAINED ENERGY

Unfortunately, you can’t choose your genes (wouldn’t that be nice?)....However, you do have the ability to be picky and consume food filled with clean ingredients.
When formulating our bars we chose natural ingredients, each with its own purpose. You won't find any fillers or artificial ingredients here! FATBAR is made from a combination of almond and/or cashew butter (depending on which flavor), creamy cocoa butter, sweet coconut, complete pea protein,  and nutty chia seeds.
We understand food biology can get a bit confusing at times... so we’re here to simplify it for you!


Note: The nutrition panels are subject to slight changes 
FAT IS BACK. EMBRACE IT.
 
THE HISTORY OF FAT
In the 1940s scientific studies showed a correlation between high fat diets and high cholesterol suggesting fat was the cause of heart disease. By the 1960s America declared a war on cholesterol which turned into a war on FAT. The low-fat ideology took hold and today still continues to be promoted by the government, medical, pharmaceutical, and food industries, as well as popular health and nutrition medias. 
During these same decades the low fat approach was in, Americans got fatter and we're now experiencing an obesity epidemic. Heart disease, diabetes, and inflammation are at a high while society continues to fear fat.
We're now entering an era that's challenging the low-carbohydrate diet. Recent studies are revealing the bad science of the 40s and are focusing on the benefits of good fats. 
Fat is essential for proper brain development and improves cognitive function. As a source of fuel it controls blood sugar levels and provides sustained energy versus the energy spikes one experiences by consuming too many carbs.
Research now shows low carb, high fat diets like the keto diet help you lose weight, lower the risk of heart disease, improve quality of sleep, enhance memory and cognition, and strengthen one’s mental clarity. They can also reduce the amount of seizures and migraines an individual can develop. 
Ditch the carbs and give FAT a chance!
FATBAR FOR ANYONE
FATBAR isn't just for people on the keto diet. It's designed for anyone looking for a wholesome, delicious bar that doesn't taste like protein powder or animal fat. It's designed for anyone looking for a filling, satiating snack that brings sustained energy and doesn't spike your blood sugar like other honey/maple/brown rice syrup laden bars.
So get snacking with some quality fat-fuel from FATBAR!

<h3>Short Story</h3>
<p>What is W A Meadwerks? It is a collaboration of two guys who love craft beverages. Joe and Roger have a passion and drive to bring mead to Long Island on a level shared by craft beer and other artisanal drinks.</p>
<p>Together, Joe and Roger bring years of hospitality and production experience to the meadery. Joe has spent 18 years in restaurants and craft beer bars, giving insight to what drives clientele to craft beverages. Roger brings over 30 years of experience in manufacturing and operations management to the team, ensuring that our mead will be the best time after time.</p>
<p>What is mead? It is said to be the oldest fermented beverage dating back to 1100 BC. It’s a beverage created from the fermentable sugar in honey and often it is called the “Wild West” of the alcohol industry.  Mead is often made with fruits, herbs, spices, and other flavors.  What is most amazing about mead is the myriad of flavors that can be created. One is only limited by their own imagination.  What is also remarkable is that mead is gluten free, making it a product with universal appeal!</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>The Goal</strong></h3>
<p>Our goal is to build a tasting room where you can enjoy our mead, promote community, conversation and camaraderie. We hope to provide meads made with locally sourced ingredients whenever possible. We will also be upgrading some of our production equipment to ensure we consistently create world class, small batch artisanal meads We are reaching out to you, our friends and family, to help us share our passion.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>At present, we have the drive and determination to make this vision a reality. We have secured a space, we have equipment, and we have some very fine ingredients. The process of building a Meadery requires numerous permits and applications. These can take time to obtain, idle time that costs money. The monies raised during this campaign will be used to build the tasting room and make the necessary upgrades to the space so we can produce the highest quality meads. This won’t be an easy road but we’re committed to seeing it through!</p>
<p>So what do you get? We’ve set up a number of options to choose from to suit any budget.</p>
<p>The most basic option includes a personal thank you, awesome stickers and a set of custom coasters. The highest option is a premium experience, which entitles you to a lifetime membership to our mead club, and we’ll make a mead together</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As we mentioned previously, this process will take a while.  We fully recognize that it may be the summer of 2018 before our meads are available. Obtaining the necessary permits and licenses is time consuming. We’ve been working diligently with our architect and Village officials to make this dream become a reality.  We have set up strategic suppliers to ensure we have the highest quality ingredients possible. All of these steps must be completed before a single ounce of honey becomes an amazing mead.</p>
<p>The list is daunting.  With this in mind, we've partnered with some industry insiders who have opened their meaderies and wineries and they've been generous enough to offer their assistance.  The mead community is a small one, but a supportive one!</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We recognize that some people can’t contribute financially, but there are other ways you can help. Share this campaign with your friends, family or anyone you know that might be interested! Share our campaign link on your social media sites! Any and all help is sincerely appreciated.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Membership to the Mead Club Includes:</strong></p>
<p>The W A Meadwerks Club membership is very special. It affords members four(4) bottles per quarter (Meadery pickup or shipping can be arranged) that have been selected by Joe and Roger. Some releases will be made available to club members before we release to the general public. In addition to the shipments, members can enjoy the benefits listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Early notice and first right to purchase limited, special release bottles, including taproom only releases.  This means no standing in line, and if you are out of state, there will be a shipping option.</li>
<li>10% off taproom purchases including drinks and bottles.</li>
<li>15% off select merchandise</li>
<li>10% off of bottles online(estimated launch Fall of 2018)</li>
<li>BYOB share events at the Meadery</li>
<li>Large bottle format releases</li>
<li>First to know about special events and offers</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Club membership shipments are expected to start October 2018</strong></p>
<p>Due to the timing of the crowdfunding and other start up legalities, we feel it is best to start our member benefit when the mead has had time to age and we’ve had time to share some experimental batches.</p>
<p>You must be at least 21 years of age in order to be a member of the Mead Club. In order to extend membership beyond the selected perk level, contact W A Meadwerks when the membership certificate is received. Standard membership fee will apply for extended quarters. Membership can be cancelled at any time.</p>

<h2>If Reading Feels Like Eating Veggies;</h2>
<p>Here is an extra short version! </p>
<ul>
<li>We sell milk, bake cookies, and smush marshmallows together with fruity pebbles so we can sell and deliver them on college campuses late at night!</li>
<li>We are shooting for a goal of $1,250 with plans to continue growing as a company if you help us crush this goal!</li>
<li>We are college students and this began as a school project, yet we have offically morphed into something bigger!</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, if you still have questions or you just enjoy reading funny literature, please scroll down to find out all about us!</p>
<h3>Long Story *Sorta* Short</h3>
<p>Late Baked began as a dream for one student, and with the help of seven other classmates, Late Baked is on it's way to becoming a thriving company that will be <i>rolling in the dough</i>. *pun*</p>
<p>As a senior in college at Southern Illinois University-Edwardsville, Ian Barbee wanted to start a late night delivery system on campus for all his late night studying hungers. In his senior level communications class, he was challenged to create a company within a semester and raise funds via crowdfunding. Challenge accepted.</p>
<p>We have two options for customers to <i>chews</i> from! *pun* We will hand deliver warm, goey, freshly baked cookies or sticky and sweet fruity pebble rice treats to campus dorms and student organizations from 9pm-midnight. We also plan to give these students cold and refreshing milk to help them wash it all down. Only a monster would eat cookies without milk. </p>
<p>With a little bit of dough and a lot of Google searches, the project is really taking off and we need YOU to<i> chip</i> in to achieve a<i> egg-cellent</i> grade. *double pun* But more importantly, we need your help to reach the students on the rest of our campus.</p>
<p>Our overall goal is just to <i>bake</i>...er, we mean, make a student's night. *pun*</p>
<h3>How We Operate</h3>
<p>We operate smoother than a nonstick pan!</p>
<p>Ian's mom wanted to send him a care package of foods he enjoyed when this idea took off! The eight classmates had a extremely ""professional"" meeting and decided that they would create this company with the intentions of selling not only to college students directly, but also indirectly by allowing parents to order cookies from around the nation! Parents and students simply send us a Facebook message and digitally send us the cash, and quicker than you can recite the Declaration of Independence backwards, we will be at your door with fresh treats!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need!</h3>
<ul>
<li>We are looking to raise $1,250 dollars to start baking and delivering. Ingredients aren't going to break the bank, but we need a chunk of change to raise awareness of our product and purchase the tools necessary to operate on a college campus.</li>
<li>Without your support, our dreams will <i>crumble, </i>*pun* and you don't want the broken dreams of eight 20 year-old's weighing on your conscious do you? </li>
</ul>
<h3>Perks!</h3>
<p>You help support us and we will give you items that you'll never forget!</p>
<p>We have 5 levels of perks. Each level receives the perks from the level(s) before it as well. For example,if you choose our Level 4 option, you will receive the perks from levels 1, 2, and 3 as well as level 4.</p>
<ul>
<li>Level 1: $5 = Newsletter with frequent updates and we will mentally give you a high five.</li>
<li>Level 2: $25 = Custom Late Baked sticker pack and a custom koozie.</li>
<li>Level 3: $50 = A Mystery Box. What's inside? I am not allowed to tell you, it's secret.</li>
<li>Level 4: $100 = A custom Late Baked T-Shirt.</li>
<li>Level 5: $420 = A priceless, handmade piece of art from us to you.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Think back to your days as a college student who was up all night studying for finals or a big test. Think about all of the stressful group projects that had to be done outside of class. Think about those boring organizational meetings you attended. </p>
<p>One thing that guarantees that you stay focused and the group stays on task is a box of freshly baked goods to bring smiles and energy to everybody. Everything is better with cookies in hand!</p>
<p>By investing in Late Baked, you are not only helping a group of students achieve something that they thought was impossible, but you would also be providing over 14,000 students with baked goods to help them power through late nights of studying! </p>
<p>Your help would bring a service to our campus and community that many have been begging for, but are unable to receive because there is hardly anybody in the area that delivers late at night.</p>
<h3>Plans For Growth</h3>
<p>Right now we are starting small and operating out of campus apartment ovens (they aren't the greatest). But we have big plans for our small company!! Once we reach the financial goal you see above, we can begin operating on our campus, but we don't plan on stopping there! Hopefully we can crush our goal on Indiegogo because out on campus they will <i>eat this up</i>! *Pun* So after we crush our goal, here is our plan:</p>
<ol>
<li>Our first order of business will be finding a better home base. We want to find a place in town with bigger, better, and more ovens.</li>
<li>Why stop here at Southern Illinois University-Edwardsville? We want to go to several other campuses, starting small in Illinois then hopefully going national!</li>
<li>Continue growing and become more than we ever expected!</li>
</ol>
<p>And ALL of this is possible with your support!!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We will be completely honest with you. Our first batch of cookies turned out amazing! Our second batch...let's say, <i>wasn't so hot</i> *pun*. When we tried to bake cookies in our campus apartment oven the second time, the oven refused to heat up. So that was a challenge, but we already had backup ovens on standby and now it feels like we are<i> cooking with gas</i>! *pun* Operating solely out of college apartments is tricky, but who doesn't like a good challenge! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are unable to support us with your wallet, we understand. Here are a few ways that you can still help us tremendously!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<i>Whisk up </i>some noise and tell all of your friends about us! *pun*</li>
<li>Share us all over your social media!</li>
<li>You could always name your children or pets after our team members. It wouldn't do us a whole lot of good, but it would be a cool story or icebreaker.</li>
</ul>
</div><p>We put 10 puns in here, so if you didn't find them all you should share us with a friend. Together you can find all 10 and feed some hungry college kids on campus!</p><p>Thank you!</p></div>","If Reading Feels Like Eating Veggies;

When we tried to bake cookies in our campus apartment oven the second time, the oven refused to heat up. So that was a challenge, but we already had backup ovens on standby and now it feels like we are cooking with gas! *pun* Operating solely out of college apartments is tricky, but who doesn't like a good challenge! 

Other Ways You Can Help
If you are unable to support us with your wallet, we understand. Here are a few ways that you can still help us tremendously!


Whisk up some noise and tell all of your friends about us! *pun*
Share us all over your social media!
You could always name your children or pets after our team members. It wouldn't do us a whole lot of good, but it would be a cool story or icebreaker.

We put 10 puns in here, so if you didn't find them all you should share us with a friend. Together you can find all 10 and feed some hungry college kids on campus!Thank you!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>f-Stop Urban Farm is transforming food culture in Austin! </h3>

<li>f-stop Urban Farm is family owned and operated in East Austin by the Farnau Family: Ryan, Hillary, Lydia &amp; Wyatt.</li>
<li>Our goal is to change the way our community approaches green, residential space, food production and consumption. We started small by transforming our home property into a market garden. Instead of grass, our front yard grows tomatoes and basil. The shared strip of land between our house and the neighbor's is a micro orchard of peach and plum trees. The backyard is a cornucopia of seasonal produce: lettuces, okra, eggplant, peppers, carrots, beets, blackberries, to name a few. </li>
<li>You'd be amazed by how much you can grow on less that 1/3 of an acre! Our tiny urban farm produces enough to sustain our family, 3 farmers markets and several local (nationally acclaimed!) restaurants.</li>
<li>In August we were given the opportunity to lease a half acre portion of land at Eden East farm an iconic, long standing farm in East Austin formerly know as Springdale farm. This 4.5 acre piece of land was lovingly maintained by Glenn and Paula Foore for over 2 decades. f-stop Urban farm is honored to continue the tradition of urban farming in East Austin while pushing the forefront of converting urban green space into a model of sustainable, organic farming as well as a place of community gathering. </li>

<h3 style=""margin-left:40px;"">Proust's Coffee Ritual : Corcellet ... nothing else !</h3>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The coffee making was a delicate art in the Proust household. In her memoir, Céleste Albaret, Marcel Proust’s trusted housekeeper, explained how she was initiated to the intricate coffee ritual.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Proust’s coffee had to be ready the moment he rang for it. It had to be brought to him in bed, while he read the paper and before he began his work, together with a pot of hot milk and one croissant. Any delay in its delivery was a very high offense.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Marcel Proust would not drink any other kind of coffee than CORCELLET</strong>.</p>
<h3 style=""margin-left:40px;"">   </h3>
<h3 style=""margin-left:40px;"">Corcellet for sure,  but the best one :<br/>Mélange Opéra</h3>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">During 200 years, from its very early days in 1760 until its very last ones in 1968,  CORCELLET  was the most prominent name in coffee in Paris.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Until 1895, when it moved to the fashionable Avenue de l'Opéra, CORCELLET sold only one coffee blend. To celebrate its relocation, it gave to its historic coffee blend the name <strong>Mélange Opéra</strong>, while extending its assortment to quite a wide range of coffee blends and single origins.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The <strong>Mélange Opéra</strong> blend was created in 1760 and is <strong>the oldest FRENCH COFFEE blend </strong>!</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">And with no exception, <strong>Marcel Proust was drinking the original Mélange Opéra</strong>.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1529071722/dvkx83o8vr4zt4ow1cfu.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Marcel PROUST's liked his coffee very strong, very bold and very intense</strong>.<br/>In order to get the strongest and thickest coffee essence as possible, it had to be brewed very slowly, drop by drop.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">To achieve the required coffee extraction, Proust requested the specific use of a CORCELLET coffee maker, that had a special coffee filter, wide and high enough to be stuffed with a large amount of ground coffee.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1529048285/zj15ymwuszw4l3ajczar.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3 style=""margin-left:40px;"">Corcellet, the French Art &amp; Tradition of Coffeeware</h3>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">CORCELLET was not only the most celebrated coffee house in France, but also the most famous delicatessen store of its time.  </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Just as tableware was part of the French Culinary Art, <strong>CORCELLET considered coffeeware as an important part of the French Coffee Art and Tradition</strong>. CORCELLET's reputation went well beyond its exquisite coffees; CORCELLET coffee makers and coffee accessories equipped most of the French High Society households.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Over the years, CORCELLET filed several patents for coffee makers, but the most acclaimed of all was a proprietary adaptation of a very popular french coffee maker called ""LA SARREGUEMINE"".<br/> </p>
<h3 style=""margin-left:40px;"">The ""SARREGUEMINE"" coffee maker, by CORCELLET</h3>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The CORCELLET cafetière was produced by a historical and well reputed pottery manufacture, La Faïencerie de Sarreguemines, established in 1790 in Sarreguemines, an industrial town in the Alsace-Lorraine region of northeastern France. That's why it was called ""LA SARREGUEMINE"".</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1529074724/ul8tbbixdup5fhxrbnbp.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The Sarreguemines manufacture was known for producing very sturdy tableware and dishware thanks to a special red clay, called ""Terre rouge de Sarreguemines"". This very particular clay had very specific properties that increased both the solidity and heat retention of the pottery, especially when used use in a bain-marie, like Céleste Albaret did when she prepared Proust's coffee.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""> </p>
<h3 style=""margin-left:40px;"">The secrets of the CORCELLET cafetière</h3>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The CORCELLET coffee maker shields many manufacturing secrets. One of them is its specific design. In the commercial brochure of the manufacture, the CORCELLET coffee maker appears under the name F° Harel, which means ""shape"" Harel.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1529071855/lmbbiz1qhmbjkqsxknjo.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Until the early 19th century, coffee was consumed in France as an infusion, such as tea.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">In 1802 appeared a new tin-plated coffee maker, called ""Du Belloy"", which allowed to prepare coffee by percolation, that is to say by passing boiling water on a container filled with coffee and pierced with holes to let the liquid pass.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">This percolation technique developed rapidly, and many versions of ""Du Belloy"" coffee makers were created (more than 13 patents filed from 1802 to 1831, and several hundred in the next 50 years).</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">In 1822, to avoid the tin taste of the tin-plated ""Du Belloy"" coffee makers, Charles Harel, well known for his inventions of culinary appliances, got the idea of manufacturing ""Du Belloy"" coffee makers with a red clay of Sarreguemines. He also substituted the tin coffee tamper used to press the coffee by a wooden tamper. The coffee was brewed with cold water and the coffee essence was heated in a bain-marie.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1529048619/z1d5chidr6f2zkeha9rj.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The CORCELLET coffee maker was sold in 9 different sizes, ranging from 1 cup to 20 cups.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">We decided to faithfully reproduce the coffee maker in the format used by Céleste Albaret to prepare Proust's coffee : a 2 cup coffee maker. She detailed in her memoir that the coffee maker contained just enough coffee for 2 cups.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The 2 cup cafetière is a tiny coffee maker that will find its place in the smallest kitchens : <strong>H 22.5 cm (8.86 in) x  W 15.2 cm (5.9)  x D 15.2 cm (5.9)</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">It can hold <strong>37.5 cl (12,6 oz)</strong> of coffee.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1529072923/opxoqp4ivhbzhcvon8wv.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">We have produced the 5 master moulds of the CORCELLET coffee maker (the coffee maker is composed of five seperate pieces),  that will be used to make the production moulds. </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">A production mould can be used approximatively 40 times, i.e. that one production mould can be used to produce 40 coffee makers.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">To manufacture the first 300 coffee makers, we need 40 production moulds.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>The 7 500 € we're looking for will entirely be used to finance the production moulds, </strong>last step before we can start production.</p>

The coffee making was a delicate art in the Proust household. In her memoir, Céleste Albaret, Marcel Proust’s trusted housekeeper, explained how she was initiated to the intricate coffee ritual.
Proust’s coffee had to be ready the moment he rang for it. It had to be brought to him in bed, while he read the paper and before he began his work, together with a pot of hot milk and one croissant. Any delay in its delivery was a very high offense.
Marcel Proust would not drink any other kind of coffee than CORCELLET.
   
Corcellet for sure,  but the best one :Mélange Opéra
During 200 years, from its very early days in 1760 until its very last ones in 1968,  CORCELLET  was the most prominent name in coffee in Paris.
Until 1895, when it moved to the fashionable Avenue de l'Opéra, CORCELLET sold only one coffee blend. To celebrate its relocation, it gave to its historic coffee blend the name Mélange Opéra, while extending its assortment to quite a wide range of coffee blends and single origins.
The Mélange Opéra blend was created in 1760 and is the oldest FRENCH COFFEE blend !
And with no exception, Marcel Proust was drinking the original Mélange Opéra.

Marcel PROUST's liked his coffee very strong, very bold and very intense.In order to get the strongest and thickest coffee essence as possible, it had to be brewed very slowly, drop by drop.
To achieve the required coffee extraction, Proust requested the specific use of a CORCELLET coffee maker, that had a special coffee filter, wide and high enough to be stuffed with a large amount of ground coffee.
 

Corcellet, the French Art & Tradition of Coffeeware
CORCELLET was not only the most celebrated coffee house in France, but also the most famous delicatessen store of its time.  
Just as tableware was part of the French Culinary Art, CORCELLET considered coffeeware as an important part of the French Coffee Art and Tradition. CORCELLET's reputation went well beyond its exquisite coffees; CORCELLET coffee makers and coffee accessories equipped most of the French High Society households.
Over the years, CORCELLET filed several patents for coffee makers, but the most acclaimed of all was a proprietary adaptation of a very popular french coffee maker called ""LA SARREGUEMINE"". 
The ""SARREGUEMINE"" coffee maker, by CORCELLET
The CORCELLET cafetière was produced by a historical and well reputed pottery manufacture, La Faïencerie de Sarreguemines, established in 1790 in Sarreguemines, an industrial town in the Alsace-Lorraine region of northeastern France. That's why it was called ""LA SARREGUEMINE"".

The Sarreguemines manufacture was known for producing very sturdy tableware and dishware thanks to a special red clay, called ""Terre rouge de Sarreguemines"". This very particular clay had very specific properties that increased both the solidity and heat retention of the pottery, especially when used use in a bain-marie, like Céleste Albaret did when she prepared Proust's coffee.
 
The secrets of the CORCELLET cafetière
The CORCELLET coffee maker shields many manufacturing secrets. One of them is its specific design. In the commercial brochure of the manufacture, the CORCELLET coffee maker appears under the name F° Harel, which means ""shape"" Harel.

Until the early 19th century, coffee was consumed in France as an infusion, such as tea.
In 1802 appeared a new tin-plated coffee maker, called ""Du Belloy"", which allowed to prepare coffee by percolation, that is to say by passing boiling water on a container filled with coffee and pierced with holes to let the liquid pass.
This percolation technique developed rapidly, and many versions of ""Du Belloy"" coffee makers were created (more than 13 patents filed from 1802 to 1831, and several hundred in the next 50 years).
In 1822, to avoid the tin taste of the tin-plated ""Du Belloy"" coffee makers, Charles Harel, well known for his inventions of culinary appliances, got the idea of manufacturing ""Du Belloy"" coffee makers with a red clay of Sarreguemines. He also substituted the tin coffee tamper used to press the coffee by a wooden tamper. The coffee was brewed with cold water and the coffee essence was heated in a bain-marie.
 

The CORCELLET coffee maker was sold in 9 different sizes, ranging from 1 cup to 20 cups.
We decided to faithfully reproduce the coffee maker in the format used by Céleste Albaret to prepare Proust's coffee : a 2 cup coffee maker. She detailed in her memoir that the coffee maker contained just enough coffee for 2 cups.
The 2 cup cafetière is a tiny coffee maker that will find its place in the smallest kitchens : H 22.5 cm (8.86 in) x  W 15.2 cm (5.9)  x D 15.2 cm (5.9)
It can hold 37.5 cl (12,6 oz) of coffee.

 

We have produced the 5 master moulds of the CORCELLET coffee maker (the coffee maker is composed of five seperate pieces),  that will be used to make the production moulds. 
A production mould can be used approximatively 40 times, i.e. that one production mould can be used to produce 40 coffee makers.
To manufacture the first 300 coffee makers, we need 40 production moulds.
The 7 500 € we're looking for will entirely be used to finance the production moulds, last step before we can start production.

 

Become one of the very few owners of a very rare Proustian Object of History...and get access to 4 extra-ordinary experiences !!! 

when he drank his CORCELLET coffee; a coffee that changed the course of French Literature !
For Proust, coffee was a lot more than just a drink or a caffeine shot.His coffee ritual was a daily gateway to inspiration and to the sensory world.
CORCELLET's Mélange Opéra is a true Proustian delight loaded with history.
Have you ever wondered what would In search of a Lost Time  become without his CORCELLET coffee ?

A taste of History : 200 years of history, percolated in your cup !
No other coffee has gone through so many historical periods, revolutions, wars and transformations of French society ...No other coffee has been drunk by so many kings, queens, emperors, empresses, presidents and artists ...No other coffee has been so much praised by the greatest gourmets and chefs of French cuisine
Over 200 years, in France, Coffee had only one name: Corcellet

The most French of all French coffees !
CORCELLET was not only a coffee, it was also the cornerstone of a unique craft and artisan know-how in the world related to coffee blends and coffee roasting.In 1789, France was the world's leading producer and exporter of coffee. CORCELLET played an important part in this epic.CORCELLET is also the first coffee house to have created a roasting workshop, with steam engines, quickly becoming a successful factory.CORCELLET is finally the first coffee house to develop roasting profiles based on the origins of coffee and their properties.CORCELLET coffee is two hundred years of French Coffee Heritage !


The reconstitution of the CORCELLET cafetière is a historic moment for all Proust fans, but also for all lovers of coffee and French history.
To celebrate this event, HISTORIAE will publish the first book ever dedicated to the history of Corcellet. The author, Jean-François Nebel, is an authority in the field of Coffee History, founder and chairman of the « Institut Français de Caféologie », author of several books about coffee and the passionate owner of Les Caféeries de Paris, the second oldest artisan Coffee Roastery in Paris that was created in 1899.
A special and limited edition of the book (300 copies) including the names of the first 300 backers (who opt for it), will be published in October 2018.
By backing the project, you will earn your name in  history.
Each backer will get one printed copy, numbered and signed by the author. 


Proust’s CORCELLET cafetière is not a simple artefact, it is the anchor of a Proustian moment, a journey of memory, that holds so much emotion, so much beauty and so much nostalgia about Proust and his time.
To preserve the Proustian magic around the lost but now revived coffee maker, the first edition will be produced in a limited and numbered series of 300 pieces, making each single cafetière an object of inestimable value.
Each coffee maker comes with a serial numbered Certificate of Authenticity.
 



We warmly thank all of you who have actively contributed to make this project a reality.

<h3>How the idea was born</h3>
<p>It all started with a local connection that had yet to be made.  Two kids of similar vintage, both with ties to Gloucester, are making their dream a reality.  Mike Brewer currently resides in Coke with roots down in Glass and extending back through the Gloucester school system.  Myron Ware was born and raised in Newport News and grew up looking across Hills Bay toward Gwynn’s Island from his grandparents’ -- now his dad’s -- house in Halliford.  The two eventually met playing volleyball at NASA in the early 90’s, shortly after Myron began homebrewing beer for himself.  Fast forward to the summer of 2016, and Mike noticed a local newspaper article stating that a brewery on Main Street has been high on the Gloucester Main Street Association and Main Street Preservation Trust list of priorities of businesses to attract for some time, and was in the top three desired businesses by Gloucester residents according to survey feedback.</p>
<p>The concept for Gloucester Brewing Company is based on building a reputation for quality, hand-crafted beers and developing strong, collaborative relationships with businesses and restaurants along Main Street and Gloucester Courthouse.  The theme for the brewery will have a local Gloucester connection as can be seen by the logo, a deadrise coming right at you, and with the names of beers having a local feel such as Low Ground Brown, Ordinary Pilsner, DeadRYEz Ale....to name a few of the initial beers GBC has been working on using our Sabco pilot system.</p>

<p>This is where we need your help!  To make this happen, we are looking for help in constructing an open-air deck on the side of our building, thus the ""All Hands On Deck"" theme of this crowdfunding effort.  We have not heard anyone tell us that this is a bad idea, and the people we've met while volunteering at Courthouse functions have continued to encourage us to just 'Open Now!!!'</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are seeking funding to create an outdoor deck that will expand our customer space and give those customers an open-air option to enjoy on their visits to Gloucester Brewing Company.</p>
<p>We've put together a set of perks that we ourselves would be interested in contributing towards if we were in your shoes reading this.  The perks run from the basics of showing support, to campaign-only perks that will allow you to let people know that you are a supporter that helped lay the foundation for Gloucester's fist brewery and taproom.  When you contribute, you will be recognized as a ""Deck Hand"", with some perks branded as such.</p>
<p>And if you're interested in saving shipping costs, we plan on having a Perk Delivery and Tasting event after our campaign ends.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We have a budget, but with a building built in the 1920's as the Gloucester Ice House and last used as an engine repair shop, we are finding that estimates we'd originally made for the build out did not fully account for the amount of work that's needed to re-purpose the space for our needs.  Every penny raised in this campaign will be put back into making this dream a reality.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As most people would attest, the prospect of being in business for yourself is a dream shared by many.  Starting your own business with nothing but a great idea and what's in your savings account can be both exciting and terrifying at the same time.  Mike and Myron (with LOTS of help from family and friends) have been hands-on from the start of this adventure, tearing the old engine repair shop down to the bones to get it ready for build-out.  There have been many expenditures so far, with many more on the horizon, but we've got a solid business plan with a local bank that supports us, and we have ordered our brewhouse equipment.  We are both familiar with managing projects with an eye toward being creative to overcome challenges when necessary.</p>
<p>We have a wide support network within the local community who have helped us along the way with advice thus far, and we are determined to overcome all obstacles that may pop up.  We're doing this and we want to bring you along to enjoy the experience.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We realize that not everyone who would like to help has the means to do so.  If you aren't able to help with a donation, we would greatly appreciate you sharing our campaign through any social media outlets you enjoy and asking your friends to spread the word, even if it's by word of mouth.</p>

<p><strong>Zunik</strong> was created by French designer Yannick HESCH. This brand was created especially for the Oriboard and intends to propose many other fun and practical objects in the future. Zunik works primarily for the development of innovative everyday objects for the kitchen and home. We want our products to be both lovely and creative.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Yannick HESCH</strong> was born in France. He studied at the European Design Institute of France and obtained a Master of Industrial Design at the University of Salford in England. He has worked for more than 15 years as an industrial designer and graphic designer. He works between Lyon and Paris and has already advised more than 300 companies. He is passionate about everyday objects because he thinks that one lives better when one is surrounded by beautiful and good objects. He loves cooking and that why he has invented the Oriboard ;) He has already won many awards for his work, including a medal at the <strong>Lépine International Competition</strong>.</p>

<p>Below are the objectives and budgets necessary to carry out the different functions of the Oriboard. We will therefore achieve at least the objectives achieved.</p>
<p>However, if we do not achieve all the objectives, we will do our best to try to find solutions to get the necessary fundings to provide you the Oriboard Advanced.<br/>We are motivated and we also want the best Oriboard.</p>
<p><strong>Join our community to follow the story of that fantastic new product !</strong></p>

Today, you may need to prepare your favorite meal using a lot of cooking tools. Afterwards, you may have to clean all this stuff. This is how the idea of the ORIBOARD was born, to help you to cook faster, easier, healthier and with more fun.
 
Here is the final Oriboard you will get :

 

Now with a knife and a simple spoon, you will only need the ORIBOARD to prepare your favorite daily meal ! This new origami-like product will also definitely finally change the way you cook.

Zunik was created by French designer Yannick HESCH. This brand was created especially for the Oriboard and intends to propose many other fun and practical objects in the future. Zunik works primarily for the development of innovative everyday objects for the kitchen and home. We want our products to be both lovely and creative.
 

 
Yannick HESCH was born in France. He studied at the European Design Institute of France and obtained a Master of Industrial Design at the University of Salford in England. He has worked for more than 15 years as an industrial designer and graphic designer. He works between Lyon and Paris and has already advised more than 300 companies. He is passionate about everyday objects because he thinks that one lives better when one is surrounded by beautiful and good objects. He loves cooking and that why he has invented the Oriboard ;) He has already won many awards for his work, including a medal at the Lépine International Competition.
 

 
 

 
I made hundreds of drawings and dozens of prototypes to finalize this form.
 

 

 

 
The final project will be slightly different. It would be bigger and stronger with a bigger cheese grater like the sketch below.
 

 
The development will continue during the campaign because I will listen your feedback to make the ORIBOARD better and closer to your expectations.   
I need you to make the ORIBOARD better and to spread the word all over the world!The larger the ORIBOARD community, the better it'll help me to make the best cutting board ever!
Thank you all !
 
 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 
Below are the objectives and budgets necessary to carry out the different functions of the Oriboard. We will therefore achieve at least the objectives achieved.
However, if we do not achieve all the objectives, we will do our best to try to find solutions to get the necessary fundings to provide you the Oriboard Advanced.We are motivated and we also want the best Oriboard.
Join our community to follow the story of that fantastic new product !

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Clara Cedeño and I am the founder and owner of La Patria Café, a new Latin American and Latin Caribbean restaurant in Syracuse, NY.  I was born and raised in New York City.  My family is from Dominican Republic and I'm first generation American.  Because of my family, I have a great love and appreciation for our traditions, our food, and values.  Because I am American, I have a love for the country I was born in.  As a Dominican-American, I have embraced all that I am and hence the name of my restaurant.  It is my way of merging my two worlds together. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1558462568/cwqkr91g8leuwhvs50r1.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I moved to Syracuse in 2012 and about three years after the move, I found myself having an existentialist crisis of sorts.  The passion for my career in the technology industry was waning and I was still feeling disconnected from Syracuse.  When I enrolled in the online MBA program at Syracuse University, I thought this would be a way to reawaken my passion for what I was doing.  But that didn't happen.  And so, I kept asking myself, ""What am I going to do when I grow up?""  A scary thought for someone who had been working in the same field for thirteen years!  But if there's one thing I know about myself is that I don't believe in doing anything in life unless I have a strong passion for it.  When I came across the space that I would later purchase for the restaurant, I knew I had to do this.  I saw great opportunity to bring authentic and traditional Latin flavors to a city that is going through a cultural evolution.  When I realized how receptive people were to the food (through private and public tastings), my resolve to open my own business grew.  In January 2018, I resigned, cashed out my options, and started pursuing my dream.   I was and continue to be ALL IN!</p>
<p>I have personally invested approximately $215,000 of my own money.  These funds have gone towards the building purchase in which the restaurant is housed, payment of materials, furniture, and labor that were used in the initial rehabbing of the space, and other expenses that went into marketing activities and payroll during the 5-month soft opening.  The business was able to secure a private business loan earlier in this year. Those additional funds are being utilized for the professional and licensed construction work (you know, the stuff I can't do) and deposits for the kitchen hood and fire suppression equipment.   Construction has started and is underway!  Very exciting times we find ourselves in. </p>
<p>La Patria Café is in need of funding support in order to secure kitchen equipment.  This is HUGE for the business because with the proper commercial kitchen equipment, we will be able to expand menu offerings, restaurant hours, and meet customer demands with efficiency.   We have so many customers who are excited about the food, service, and ambience of La Patria Café but the kitchen constraint has kept us from being able to open weekday evenings and weekends.  That constraint has also kept us from making the impact we are looking to have on Syracuse and within our immediate community.</p>

<h3><strong>Risks and Challenges</strong></h3>
</div><div>
<p>Every business is difficult and the restaurant industry is one of, if not, the hardest to break into and be successful.  When I wrote my business plan, as excited as I was to follow my dream, I knew I would need to fully consider the risks and challenges inherit in the industry. </p>
<p>Some of the major challenges that I had anticipated - then actually faced VERY early on - were zoning and landmark preservation board requirements. </p>
<p><i>Landmark Preservation:</i></p>
<p>The structure is historically designated.  Knowing that the board would frown upon the idea of installing a hood system with duct work running up the side of the house, three months prior to formally presenting my plans I asked to be on the agenda to discuss high-level ideas and get their input.  I understood that creating dialogue would be helpful in avoiding any surprises on both sides.  When the time came, we received a unanimous approval to move forward with the work.  This was a pre-cursor to what we had to face with the Zoning department.</p>
<p><i>Zoning:</i></p>
<p>Again, it was about creating dialogue with the City. While the structure had previously been given legal permission to use the space as a restaurant, that was only for the first floor and therefore, I had to go before the board of appeals and plead the case for extending the use to the second floor as well as allowing for the changes needed (hood system and bar installs, etc.) in order to function as a proper establishment.  Again, due to the meetings held months before with the various City departments, there were no surprises and we received unanimous approval to move forward.</p>
<p><i>Other challenges:</i></p>
<p>And then to my surprise..... <strong>the construction permits took SEVEN MONTHS</strong>!  The time it took the City to review my submission was beyond the standard.  I kept at it everyday, every week, and every month - staying in contact and following up.  And as those months went by, I found myself realizing that I couldn't just stay closed waiting and doing nothing.  That's what prompted the soft opening.  It was difficult and the money was going fast, but the experience was invaluable and we are better for it.  I used a moment that I thought would end my dream before I got to see it realized to the restaurant's benefit.  It wasn't going to be easy because we didn't have the equipment for a full menu so we came up with a limited menu, tested weekly specials, and between the Chef, my daughter, my step-son, and me, La Patria Café came alive and people loved it!  And then a few didn't.....the <u>valuable</u> feedback allowed us to tweak certain items, cooking processes (given there was not fire power to speak of) and overall service procedures.   We even managed to pull off a special reservations-only Saturday service!  </p>

<p>Getting people to walk through the door is always going to be an ongoing issue.  Particularly, getting your target market through the door.  When we were open for those first five months, we tested varying ways to get the market's attention.  Social media, networking, radio, and newspaper articles have all proven to be effective.  We were only serving during a limited window of hours (M-F, 11am-3pm) and we are not situated in the downtown area which makes us a destination of sorts.  And yet, we got people through the door.  Our focused marketing efforts paid off.  The partnerships we have built with our small business neighbors has helped greatly.</p>
<p>As an individual, I am aware that having a MBA degree isn't always enough particularly when you're entering an industry that you have very limited and outdated experience in.  However, the degree has given me the tools to ensure that the business decisions being made day-in and day-out are well thought-out and that I am tapping into resources that I would otherwise may have ignored.  But that still isn't enough!  I knew that as well.  So I made certain to align myself with mentors who own restaurants and even worked weekends for one of my mentors.  It was great!  Working as a hostess, as a bar back, as a runner, and as kitchen help gave me a unique perspective to each of the positions within a restaurant and has given me a point of reference to work off of as I further develop our processes for La Patria Café when we reopen.</p>

</div></div>","The Lubrano Story 
 

 
We are Mattia and Gianpaolo Lubrano, inseparable brothers since birth. We had our first break in the hospitality business working at our uncle's restaurant when we were teenagers. Over the years, we spent a lot of time working in London and Dubai. We wanted to immerse ourselves in the hospitality industry to see the possibilities of launching our own food truck in Italy. It was our childhood dream. 
 

 
In 2018, we decided to take our first big step conceptualizing the Lubrano hospitality business starting with our food truck.
 
 
Mattia is a hospitality and tourism fanatic who's worked at Scalini, an iconic Italian restaurant and Gaucho restaurant in London. Mattia used his passion for the industry to travel and embrace the spirit of different cultures. 
 

Gianpaolo attended a catering school in Italy and completed a sequence of training and masterclasses between Italy and London.  He led the bar of the iconic Gaucho restaurant in Broadgate and after two years, moved to the historic Savoy hotel as a bartender.
 

What We Need
We need your support to help fund the business. We are aiming to raise $30,000 which will go to: 

Funding and design for our food truck
Marketing and events
Central kitchen
Research and development for new signature dishes



 
The Idea
Hospitality for us means home, familiarity, and warmth.
The company is represented by the pineapple, an exotic fruit that transmits warmth and welcomes people.
Genuine quality food and hospitable service will be delivered to all our clients making every Lubrano experience magical.
We brainstormed on how to best share our concept in as many locations as possible, leading us to the creation of Lubrano on the road and soon Lubrano at home.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are part of a new wave of Vermont farmers, grape growers and wine makers who believe that wine is food and soil comes first.

We've watched the wine world change as more people reach beyond conventional, ordinary wines for natural, healthy, raw wines. Natural wine and cider makers in Vermont are creating a new wine region. We've got six acres of grapes in the ground—some we sell to our neighbors and fellow natural winemakers. We'd like to start making our own wines.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Adopt a Vermont Vine!</p>
<p>We are hoping to raise $140,000 to build the place to make our wines. The winery will have a basement for storage, a main floor for pressing and blending, a crush pad for stomping, and a third floor for storage and interns. You can receive la Collina glasses, tote bags, a case of wine, a vine in your name (through our unique Adopt-a-Vermont-Vine program), a reserve label in your name, and a place at the harvest table (come help us stomp!), depending on your contribution. If we don't reach our total goal, we'll begin by buying a press, a de-stemmer, and some fermentation tanks. Then we'll press on!</p>
<p><strong>Be a Part of a Brave New Wine Region</strong></p>
<p>Help us to build this new wine region in Vermont—unique in flavor, terroir, and place in world viticulture. You can be a part of this brave new future. We've watched these alpine vines survive three winters, and they just get stronger. The less intervention, the better.

We are part of a new wave of Vermont farmers, grape growers and wine makers who believe that wine is food and soil comes first.

There are good reasons why much of the rest of the country looks to Vermont to keep its soul alive.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Lindsey and Rj Marvin opened Barrel + Brine in December 2015 with the goal of being Buffalo's first shop devoted to all things fermented, preserved, cured and pickled.   Since opening the doors, the support we have seen from our local community has been nothing short of amazing.   It is because of this continued support that Barrel + Brine is now being sold in artisanal stores, cafes, restaurants, bars and regional grocery chains.   As the demand grows the need for a larger production space is needed.  The larger space not only allows us to produce more but it also gives us the ability to give directly back to those who have shown us support since day one.  </p>
<p>We have always realized that our success is a direct reflection of the support we have received from our friends and customers.   </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why We Need The Money...</h3>
<p>We're seeking $50,000.  Thats a LOT of money but we promise that every cent we receive through crowdfunding will go directly towards new equipment and building out a comfortable, communal space to enjoy our pickles and ferments.  This will not only allow us to make a more consistent product and meet our growing demands, but it will also result in lower costs to our customers. </p>

<u>KOMBUCHA:</u>  </h3>
<p>One major struggle we have always faced was producing enough of our kombucha to meet the growing demand.  With the new space we will be scaling up production from 200 Gallons to 1200 Gallons!  This means we will be buying 3 new 2500L fermentation tanks, and a lot more kegs.  </p>
<h3><u>WALK-IN COOLER:</u></h3>
<p>We will be building a 400 square foot walk-in cooler within the facility.  This will allow us to store our product once packed; but the thing that really excites us is the opportunity to purchase more produce from our local farmers.   We're as locally sourced as possible and with a walk-in cooler of this size, we will be able to store more of the fruits and vegetables that make their way into our bottles and jars.  Our kombucha is never flavored with concentrates, extracts or flavorings.  We use real fruit, and to be honest it's going to be awesome to be able to purchase a literal ton of seasonal blueberries!</p>
<h3><u>FERMENTS/PICKLES:</u></h3>
<p>We will be scaling up production of fermented and pickled foods from 600LB monthly to just over a ton!  Thats a lot of Sauerkraut.</p>
<h3><u>TAP ROOM/CAFE: </u></h3>
<p>As we've mentioned we're very thankful for the support we have received.  We've met so many amazing people through fermentation and we couldn't think of a better way to celebrate those experiences than with a Taproom and Cafe. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<u>Our Taproom</u> will offer a line of kombucha, including specialty batch and seasonal offerings by the glass, growler or flight.  Flavors like Strawberry-Rhubarb,  Edelweiss Grape, or Beet &amp; Apple will make an appearance as well as our favorite local beer, cider and wine. </li>
<li>
<u>The Taproom</u> will have a full Bloody Mary Menu with house pickled garnishes. Unique Kombucha cocktails, and other spiked fermented drinks.</li>
<li>
<u>Our Cafe </u>will feature small menu perfect for snacking while enjoying a few drinks. Pickle plates, grab and go items and snacks with a focus on fermentation.  Many vegetarian and vegan options will be available on a rotating, seasonal menu.  Plus we plan on having one awesome brunch fully equipped with the craziest Bloody Mary Bar around.</li>
<li>
<u>The Taproom/Cafe</u> space will also allow us to host more events like pop-up dinners, classes and our pop-up lunches which have become popular since opening.   Also, brunch. Did we mention brunch? </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3><u>Education and Community</u></h3>
<ul>
<li>Fermentation has been a part of human existence for thousands of years and has its roots in community.  Our new space will allow us to focus on education and our goal of strengthening the understanding of fermented foods through interactive classes, lectures and demonstrations.  We will also be enrolled in Start-Up NY which will give us the ability to speak directly to college students looking to enter the field of nutrition or restaurant/hotel management.  </li>
<li>Barrel + Brine also works closely with Journey's End Refugee service to find jobs for our local refugees.</li>
<li>Space will also be available for local chefs to experiment with fermentation and preservation.</li>

I believe that entrepreneurship is the new activism, that teaching women business skills will alleviate global poverty, and that baking beautiful delicious vegan cupcakes is an excellent way to build awareness of the meat and dairy industries. I have lofty goals, grand plans, and some mouth-watering recipes.
 
What: Sweet Cheeks Vegan Bakery is a catering and wholesale company dedicated to baking compassionate sweets, while advocating for animal rights. Our Chocolate Strawberry cupcakes were VegNews Magazine’s “staff pick” for tasty treats, we have a dedicated customer base in NYC, and cafes and restaurants ready to place orders. We just need the commercial kitchen space to fill those orders!

When and Where: Right now in NYC!
 
 Why: 






1. Sweet Cheeks cupcakes are more delicious and healthy then cupcakes made with dairy.




2. We donate cupcakes for events to Farm Sanctuary, Best Friends Animal Society, and NYC’s Veggie Prom and Food Festivals.

3. Your Health: Going Vegan reduces your risk of heart disease by 50% and cancer by 40%. Animal products are the main   source of saturated fat and the only source of cholesterol in the diet. These are cholesterol free cupcakes!

4. The Environment 

If everyone went vegetarian for just one day, the U.S. would save:
 
a.     100 billion gallons of water, enough to supply all the homes in New England for almost 4 months
b.     70 million gallons of gas — enough to fuel all the cars of Canada and Mexico combined with plenty to spare
c.     3 million acres of land, an area more than twice the size of Delaware
d.     33 tons of antibiotics.





 
Save the environment by eating incredible cupcakes? Sounds good to me!
 
 
 How: We need funds to cover our start-up costs. We already have our website, legal status, labels, packaging, and of course  t-shirts. Now we need commercial kitchen space, insurance, and our Food Processing Establishment License, and we need your help to get us there!
 
$25 – Will cover one hour in our commercial kitchen space

<h3>Thank you!</h3>
<p>Hi everyone! Amanda here! If you find yourself here, you must be interested in Baking the World a Better Place. Fourteen Twenty Nine has been in business since January 2018. We began as an idea to change the community we live in and have grown to a bustling home bakery. </p>
<p>We have outgrown our home bakery and we are moving! We are moving to our first commercial space in Gahanna, Ohio! I am so excited to be partnering with another local business to work together to bring you our delicious desserts in new ways. To complete this move, we need your help! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need YOU! </p>
<p>We are raising $7,000 to continue our mission of helping the most vulnerable among us. We are working to build a work training program that will serve the survivors we hire onto our team. This is an extensive process and requires a lot of work and mindfulness to do it right, which is always what we want to be doing. </p>
<p>These funds will also be used to complete our rebrand that was started when we participated in the SEA Change accelerator program this past summer 2020, purchase new packaging, and continuing making delicious desserts.</p>
<p>By donating to our cause, you are going to get some awesome perks like <strong>t</strong><strong>-shirts, sweatshirts, free brownies, gift cards, and more!</strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><u><i>As an established social enterprise we ALREADY have a track record of making an impact in our community</i></u>. Our dream is to build equitable programs that train and equip survivors of trafficking in the workforce. By moving into a commercial kitchen we are going to be able to dig into this dream and<strong> make it a reality!</strong></p>
<p>These donations will truly allow us to continue our work with the women who need us the most right here in Columbus, Ohio. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As a young business owner, I have been through many challenges already. I have overcome the challenge of running a business completely from my home, juggling two small children, taking classes to improve my business knowledge and network with others in the community. </p>
<p>These challenges have led Fourteen Twenty Nine to where we are today and we are ready to continue to make measurable social change and bake the world a better place.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you cannot donate, please share our campaign with your network!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Leandra Nichola and I could not be more excited to be founding Main Street Pearl, a bubbly bar, noshery, and tuck shop in lovely Takoma Park, Maryland. </p>
<p>Pearl is a product of my love for craft drinks, micro-enterprise, and inclusive community space, and my commitment to serving my community. The shop will feature a bubbly drinks bar - including bubble tea, scratch sodas, kombucha, beer, cider, and sparkling wine - as well as prepared nosh from featured local foodpreneurs.  Our “Pearl Squad” - a group of young Takoma Parkers interested in business - will operate our tuck shop, featuring grab and go snacks and youth-made crafts.</p>
<p>The vision is to create a space that is intentionally inclusive for the whole community - from a relaxed and fun ambiance to a broad menu and retail items from local artisans and makers, I want everyone to see something for them at Pearl. </p>
<p>Two decades of personal and professional commitment to ethical consumerism, community-building, and working to create a more compassionate world makes me uniquely qualified to bring this new kind of business to life.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I hope Main Street Pearl will provide Takoma Park:</p>
<ul>
<li>somewhere fun to connect with neighbors and friends.</li>
<li>unique, craft drinks that you can’t find elsewhere on our Main Street.</li>
<li>an opportunity to support other microbusinesses. </li>
<li>a safe and supportive place for young people to spend time together.</li>
<li>a business that steps lightly on the planet. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Main Street Pearl will open its doors (in whatever capacity we can!) at 7050 Carroll Ave in Takoma Park, Maryland in early February 2021.  And, we need your help to do it! </p>
<p>Opening a new business during a pandemic is especially tricky and we are trying to raise additional funds to ensure we can do it safely and give Pearl the best shot at success in spite of the unusual challenges we’ll face in our first year. Our goal is to raise $20,000 from our community.</p>
<p>In addition to getting a fun place for you and your friends to connect, everyone who contributes will get perks!</p>
<ul>
<li>Admiring Ally - $10 - Reusable Straw</li>
<li>Bubbly Backer - $25 - Straw &amp; drink voucher</li>
<li>Fizzy Financier - $50 - 2 straws, 2 drink vouchers</li>

</div></div>","Short Summary
My name is Leandra Nichola and I could not be more excited to be founding Main Street Pearl, a bubbly bar, noshery, and tuck shop in lovely Takoma Park, Maryland. 
Pearl is a product of my love for craft drinks, micro-enterprise, and inclusive community space, and my commitment to serving my community. The shop will feature a bubbly drinks bar - including bubble tea, scratch sodas, kombucha, beer, cider, and sparkling wine - as well as prepared nosh from featured local foodpreneurs.  Our “Pearl Squad” - a group of young Takoma Parkers interested in business - will operate our tuck shop, featuring grab and go snacks and youth-made crafts.
The vision is to create a space that is intentionally inclusive for the whole community - from a relaxed and fun ambiance to a broad menu and retail items from local artisans and makers, I want everyone to see something for them at Pearl. 
Two decades of personal and professional commitment to ethical consumerism, community-building, and working to create a more compassionate world makes me uniquely qualified to bring this new kind of business to life.
Ultimately, I hope Main Street Pearl will provide Takoma Park:

somewhere fun to connect with neighbors and friends.
unique, craft drinks that you can’t find elsewhere on our Main Street.
an opportunity to support other microbusinesses. 
a safe and supportive place for young people to spend time together.
a business that steps lightly on the planet. 


What We Need & What You Get
Main Street Pearl will open its doors (in whatever capacity we can!) at 7050 Carroll Ave in Takoma Park, Maryland in early February 2021.  And, we need your help to do it! 
Opening a new business during a pandemic is especially tricky and we are trying to raise additional funds to ensure we can do it safely and give Pearl the best shot at success in spite of the unusual challenges we’ll face in our first year. Our goal is to raise $20,000 from our community.
In addition to getting a fun place for you and your friends to connect, everyone who contributes will get perks!

Bubbly Backer - $25 - Straw & drink voucher

<p>Have you ever walked down the wine isle, stared at 30 different bottles of Pinot Noir, and chose the bottle with the coolest logo? Or taken a sip, liked it, but couldn't pinpoint why? I was the same. For the longest time, I enjoyed drinking wine, but never understood what I was drinking.

<p>We have finished our research and finalized the app design. However, our team is made of wine experts... not app developers. As such, we have selected a professional developer to turn our dream into a live, engaging mobile application. The team can develop the basic version of the app for $10,000, which is what we aim to raise on indiegogo. There are several additional features we would like to add, so anything above $10,000 will go to developing these extra bells and whistles.</p>

Situato sulle alte Madonie, nell’entroterra siciliano più sconosciuto e inesplorato, è il luogo in cui Alessio e la sua famiglia stanno portando avanti l’intuizione di nonno Geatano di impiantare, nella vigna di famiglia, un vitigno cosmopolita considerato quasi un autoctono.<br/> È da questo legame con la propria terra che nascono Syrah e Grillo, che della Sicilia raccontano i profumi, gli odori e la storia di una famiglia che vuole contribuire al suo sviluppo con una scommessa concreta: impiantare nuovi ettari di vigna di Carricante, Nerello Mascalese e di Perricone, coltivati in regime strettamente biologico e con lavorazione naturale. <br/>Perché amare la terra senza compromessi, vuol dire ascoltare le sue esigenze per restituirle la dignità che merita.</p><p><br/><i>Tenuta San Giaime is located a few kilometers from Gangi, a beautiful village of 7000 inhabitants among the most beautiful in Italy. Located in the high Madonie, in the most unknown and unexplored inland Sicily, is the place where Alessio and his family are carrying on the intuition of grandfather Geatano to plant, in the family vineyard, a cosmopolitan vine considered almost an autochthonous. Syrah and Grillo are born from this link with their land, which tell of Sicily the scents, the smells and the history of a family that wants to contribute to its development with aconcrete bet: to plant new hectares of Carricante vineyard, Nerello Mascalese and Perricone, cultivated in strictly organic and natural processing. Because loving the earth without compromise means listening to its needs to restore the dignity it deserves. </i></p><p><br/><strong> STORIA - <i>Story</i></strong></p><p>Gangi è un borgo situato nel cuore delle Madonie della Sicilia settentrionale, a 1.000 mt. sul livello del mare. Eletto “Borgo più bello d’Italia 2014” e “Comune Gioiello d’Italia 2012“, è il luogo dove io e la mia famiglia abbiamo creato Tenuta San Giaime. Fin da bambino osservavo mio nonno coltivare questa terra così difficile, perché chiede di essere ascoltata, ma ricca, perché sa essere grata dell’amore che le si riserva.

Located in the high Madonie, in the most unknown and unexplored inland Sicily, is the place where Alessio and his family are carrying on the intuition of grandfather Geatano to plant, in the family vineyard, a cosmopolitan vine considered almost an autochthonous. Syrah and Grillo are born from this link with their land, which tell of Sicily the scents, the smells and the history of a family that wants to contribute to its development with aconcrete bet: to plant new hectares of Carricante vineyard, Nerello Mascalese and Perricone, cultivated in strictly organic and natural processing.

We designed this product knowing that Moka pots, many pod machines, and other in-home brewers claim to make espresso, but really only provide you with a cup of strong coffee, unless you want to pay hundreds or even thousands of dollars.We created the NEO to be simple, environmentally friendly, cost-effective, and fun, all while producing delicious espresso. The NEO: by Flair EspressoFlow-Control Brewing for Simple Espresso ShotsThe NEO features a flow-control portafilter, which simplifies the brewing process by controlling the flow of your brew water through your coffee grounds to ensure proper espresso extraction. This means that you can use any whole beans you want and grind them with any grinder you have — from high end burr grinders to less expensive bladed grinders.  The result will be the same. Beautiful, delicious shots of espresso topped with a thick layer of crema. The NEO: Flow-control PortafilterDelicious Espresso. Just Check the Crema.Crema, that thick, delicious foam on the top of a shot of espresso, is a great indicator of a well-extracted shot. If you've been missing this in your morning routine, the NEO has what you need and more. Lower the lever, and just watch as your espresso blooms in your cup.    The NEO: Beautiful Crema in Every Brewed ShotBuilt to Last with Durable Metal ComponentsPeople say that Flair Espresso Makers are built like tanks, and the NEO is no different. Reinforced, die-cast aluminum is used for the base and lever, which can withstand forces that far exceed those needed to make good espresso. Our brewing cylinder, meanwhile, is stainless steel, which unlike plastics and polycarbonates, does not expand under normal operating pressures, so all that force on the lever can be immediately converted into pressure for brewing your espresso.  The NEO: Made of Durable Metal Components Backed by 5-Year WarrantyFully Manual and Environmentally Friendly EspressoThe NEO requires no electricity, and is a fully manual lever press. There are no pods to be wasted and thrown into a landfill with this espresso maker; only real coffee beans, ground by you. This means that each time you manually lower the lever, with you own hands, you're contributing to a healthier world. Feels good doesn't it?   The NEO: Environmentally Friendly Espresso
 The NEO Removes Pods From Your Daily CoffeeA Simple, No-Fuss Brewing ProcessThe NEO is meant to make brewing espresso fun and easy. In fact, there are only four major steps for brewing with the NEO, and the entire process can be done in less than two minutes. This process is simple and easy, leaving you more time to enjoy your daily dose each day.    First, grind your beans with ANY grinder, and fill the flow-control portafilter with grounds using the funnel. Tamp with the tamper. Add the screen on top!The NEO: Prepare Your Grounds Don't forget to preheat your brewing cylinder! Use just boiled water and a small bowl. Let the cylinder sit for at least 30 seconds. Then it will be ready to use.The NEO: Preheat Your Brew Cylinder Assemble the brewing head by first placing the filled portafilter onto the Flair. Then remove your preheated cylinder and affix to the top of the portafilter. You can now fill with your brew water just off the boil.The NEO: Assembling The Brew Head Lower the lever and watch as the NEO brews beautiful, crema-topped shots of espresso into your cup. It takes a bit of force, so you might want to use two hands!The NEO: Pull Your Shot By Lowering The LeverSavings in Your Pocket with the NEOThe NEO, with a low retail cost of just $119, is not only affordable, it's also extremely cost effective, especially when compared to visiting your local cafe for your daily dose. If you brew your espresso every day with the NEO, you will be saving at least $500 per year…and this includes the cost of your NEO!  Cost Savings With The NEOChoose Your Own Brewing Aesthetic With the NEO, you don't have to settle for just one color. No matter if your coffee station or kitchen has a dark or light theme, we've got you covered. Choose between our standard gun-metal grey version of the NEO, or brighten things up a bit by selecting our white color.  No matter your preference, you can be sure you've made a great choice.The NEO Family: Choose Between Grey or WhiteWhat's Included in The NEOThe NEO comes with everything you need to start brewing delicious, espresso right from the box. Included is the post and lever, the base, the full NEO brewing head which includes the cylinder, flow-control portafilter, piston and stainless steel screen, as well as a funnel, dosing cup & tamper, and the drip tray. The NEO: What's Included In addition, the NEO can be upgraded, and fits snugly into our custom carrying case, offered separately or as part of our Second Shot Travel Kit Perk, which includes the carrying case and an additional Flow-Control Portafilter for brewing two shots one after the other.The NEO: Second Shot Travel Kit Includes A Carrying Case and an Extra Portafilter  Finally, the NEO post and lever also fits our Bottomless 2-in-1 Portafilter and Pressure Gauge, so that when you are ready to upgrade and challenge your espresso making skills, these are available to you. How Big is the NEO?The NEO is roughly 12 inches long, 6 inches wide, and 10 inches tall (31.5 x 15.5 x 26cm).

<p>How horrible is it when your favourite song comes on and the bass is weak or the treble is ear-piercing? Well-balanced audio requires the use of a good equalizer (EQ), and just like audio, <strong>great <u>flavor</u> requires harmony and balance!</strong></p>
<p>With this in mind, KRUVE used several science-backed sensation and perception principles to harmonize the senses:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1541478130/pm7khl5as1cn7snyzmom.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Each glass offers a unique <strong>rim architecture</strong> and <strong>liquid surface area</strong>, so taste will differ significantly. </p>
<p>A larger liquid surface area increases the rate of oxidation, which in turn, softens the tannins and acidity.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1541467501/o56tc4qhrnuud6uen36i.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Rim architecture affects the flow and spread of the beverage on your tongue, which in turn, impacts the number of taste receptors that get activated.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1541478220/yiah58tn8hnup8loqpuo.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Both glasses offer a significant amount of <strong>headspace</strong> (i.e. volume of air between the liquid surface and the rim of the glass).</p>
<p>Each glass also features a <strong>unique internal shape</strong>, which can greatly impact the aromatic focus of the beverage. A more bulbous glass shape can better soften and retain an aroma, as well as increase nose involvement. Whereas, a more narrow glass shape will concentrate the volatile compounds and funnel the aroma more directly to the nose.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1541175178/k2x9bhbtsc7yl8m8qrae.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Also, both glasses offer a <strong>high-tilt drink angle</strong>, which is important for smelling all those wonderful aromas while drinking.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>

<p>Both glasses are made from <strong>heat-resistant double-walled borosilicate glass </strong>that tapers into a<strong> single-wall at the rim</strong>. The double wall keeps the temperature stable so that it’s hot while standing, yet perfect for drinking. The double wall also ensures it’s comfortable to hold. The single wall at the top keeps the rim thin so that it’s comfortable to drink.</p>

<p>But, what about one of the world's most popular specialty beverages - coffee?</p>

<p>Much like wine glassware, coffee glassware should not and cannot have a one-glass-fits-all solution.

KRUVE EQ Taste Test
100% real and un-scripted feedback. To make it interesting, we threw in a bit of a twist at the end. What they didn't realize was...well, you can watch and see for yourself!
 
What the experts are saying...

 
 

How horrible is it when your favourite song comes on and the bass is weak or the treble is ear-piercing? Well-balanced audio requires the use of a good equalizer (EQ), and just like audio, great flavor requires harmony and balance!
With this in mind, KRUVE used several science-backed sensation and perception principles to harmonize the senses:

Each glass offers a unique rim architecture and liquid surface area, so taste will differ significantly. 
A larger liquid surface area increases the rate of oxidation, which in turn, softens the tannins and acidity.

Rim architecture affects the flow and spread of the beverage on your tongue, which in turn, impacts the number of taste receptors that get activated.
 
 

Both glasses offer a significant amount of headspace (i.e. volume of air between the liquid surface and the rim of the glass).
Each glass also features a unique internal shape, which can greatly impact the aromatic focus of the beverage. A more bulbous glass shape can better soften and retain an aroma, as well as increase nose involvement. Whereas, a more narrow glass shape will concentrate the volatile compounds and funnel the aroma more directly to the nose.

Also, both glasses offer a high-tilt drink angle, which is important for smelling all those wonderful aromas while drinking.
 
 

Both glasses are made from heat-resistant double-walled borosilicate glass that tapers into a single-wall at the rim. The double wall keeps the temperature stable so that it’s hot while standing, yet perfect for drinking. The double wall also ensures it’s comfortable to hold. The single wall at the top keeps the rim thin so that it’s comfortable to drink.
 
 

You can also find harmony and balance in the glass shapes. They are a perfectly balanced inverse in terms of outer glass shape, yet feature a completely unique inner glass shape.

Additionally, the clear glass material allows for true appreciation of coffee texture and color. 
The glasses were designed for the human, with respect to the ergonomic profile. However, they were also designed for the environment, ensuring they are the perfect aesthetic addition to any kitchen or cafe!
 
 

The EVOKE carafe is double-to-single-walled, allowing for proper thermal control and precise pouring.

Add to that - it can be used with many popular brewers!

<h3>Beginnings</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Liliana.  I have worked in banking for over 12 years. Though, I developed a knack for getting things done in the banking world, made many wonderful friends and relationships, I felt I wanted to do something more.</p>
<p>One of my passions is preparing food and drinks for my friends and family. It was on one such occasion, when I had prepared my family’s ponche de granada recipe, that a friend suggested I manufacture it.</p>
<p>At first, I thought, I could never do that! Well, then I thought, why not? Then, it occurred to me, I might just succeed at this. So, I made the decision to go for it! I turned my decision into a dream and began to make  that dream a reality!  </p>

<p>However, I spent the last two years in a bubble that kept me from achieving this goal. I had many helpful and loving people that wanted to see La Noche become a success.

<p>I’m not sure, but whatever the reason, I now feel that may not have been the right thing for me to do; to just leave those who wanted to help on the outside. So, now, how would I reach out to all those people who offered help? I kept this in the back of my mind over these last years. Then, just recently, a friend told me about crowdfunding. Not being internet savvy, I had no idea what that was. So I researched.   </p>
<p>My research led me to Indiegogo. It just made the most sense. Specifically because La Noche is an alcohol-based liqueur and, because of this, we are not permitted to offer it directly as a ‘perk’ for contributors. However, Indiegogo suggested instead, we could offer a membership package as a perk and thus, we'd be able to ship La Noche to our members! Awesome, since I would like for everyone who wants to try La Noche to be able to!</p>

<h2><strong>The Impact</strong></h2>
<p>La Noche is better enjoyed with friends. Each journey that La Noche takes to get to your table helps employ over 100 people from farmers, bottle makers, transporters, printers, retailers, etc. With La Noche's growth there will be a steady raise in the amount of people that benefit. </p>

<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>As you may or may not know, the spirits industry is controlled by a few corporations and the government. One of the challenges is getting the product into the 17 alcohol regulated states for distribution and sales. Another challenge is getting a distributor into the rest of the states but California, since every state has different alcohol laws and regulations. Another Challenge is balancing life, we will be working without compensation, until the numbers make sense. Risks: Filling orders with limited inventory will be another challenge we cant grow too fast for this reason. Moving the area limitations to an online presence this requires a storefront and a type 21 licence. </p>

Campaign Our Goals

$5700 is the minimum amount needed that will allow us to bring a pallet of product in, we will use this to fill the perk requirements and continue to create buzz for the product and locate potential investors.
$11400 is the go for it amount. With this amount La Noche will be available in select pubs and restaurants. We will send out detail and location for those interested in knowing. 
 $22800 this is the amount that will allow us to bring in enough product for distribution for smaller chain stores and restaurants. We will hit the ground running with this amount.
$47000 with this amount we will be able to obtain a licence which will allow us to sell the product online. We will also be able to fulfill the $22800 requirements. 
$61000 This is the ultimate stretch goal for La Noche.  With this amount we will cover all of the above and will be able to run promotions.  See the chart at the bottom for this amount's breakdown details.

Beginnings
Hi, my name is Liliana.  I have worked in banking for over 12 years. Though, I developed a knack for getting things done in the banking world, made many wonderful friends and relationships, I felt I wanted to do something more.
One of my passions is preparing food and drinks for my friends and family. It was on one such occasion, when I had prepared my family’s ponche de granada recipe, that a friend suggested I manufacture it.
At first, I thought, I could never do that! Well, then I thought, why not? Then, it occurred to me, I might just succeed at this. So, I made the decision to go for it! I turned my decision into a dream and began to make  that dream a reality!  

However, I spent the last two years in a bubble that kept me from achieving this goal. I had many helpful and loving people that wanted to see La Noche become a success. They would, at times, offer financial assistance. However, I never accepted. My business plan had called for only a few large investors, but each time I told someone that wanted to help me, “No, thank you.”, I felt I was letting them down.

<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">With a huge gap between automatic ice cube vending machines and ice cube trays and bags, I wondered when someone would come up with something better. They didn’t – so I took action! </p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">My name is Kim Jensen and I’m Danish. I am an engineer by profession and have years of experience of turning product ideas into final products, ready to ship. I quit my job with a big pharma company to work on this project for a year. I’d spent 13 years developing ideas and was ready to turn the plans and technical drawings into reality. After a year and several prototypes later – the <b>ice</b>breaker was born.</p>
<div style=""font-weight: normal;"">
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1447186435/xwvwhwscipluvxhcz96a.png"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p>
<p>The <b>ice</b>breaker is designed for easy cleaning and assembly, simplicity and elegance. With a team of the best design and material engineers in Denmark who have reviewed and developed the <b>ice</b>breaker, my mantra has been </p>
<p>‘<i>It must work smoothly to overcome the obstacles that existing solutions offer.</i>’</p>
<h1></h1>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1447186436/bdbbbgeefdcreogteesu.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The <b>ice</b>breaker has been carefully engineered so that it can be produced from a few simple plastic parts and silicone gaskets. This makes it easy to clean and use, but maybe even more importantly, having a simple device is much more robust than a complex device. Actually, when you see it, you will say, ”why didn’t I think of that?” </p>
<p>Each of these principles has had to be tested function by function, as a modular test, rather as a complete functional test, which would require all the parts to be molded and assembled to the final product. This has been a huge part of the development, but it has also revealed the challenges of making ice cubes inside a closed chamber. Careful considerations and solution of these challenges provided the foundation for our 5 patents.  </p>
<p>We would love to brag a bit more about how smart it is and how we made it, but due to the risk of copying, we have to keep some of the details close to our chests.</p>

</div>","Each icebreaker produces 12 chunky ice cubes – simply and elegantly:



It’s easy to fill from the tap or a bottle – with no spillage 
It can be put into the freezer anywhere there’s a space, at any angle and it won’t leak 
it is compressed while in the freezer, and it expands back to its normal shape when you need to use it. 
It delivers perfect ice cubes with an easy twist action, so you can forget about that battle with the ice cube tray altogether. 
It’s designed to be on display on your drinks table to deliver a great impression.
It is easy to disassemble and to put the parts in the dishwasher.



The icebreaker fits into any gap in your freezer so you don’t need to find a flat space – it is compressed while in the freezer, and it expands back to its normal shape when you need to use it.



            


Its sleek design allows it to fit into any small gap so you can optimize your freezer space. The ice cubes are 40 mm wide.




With the icebreaker it is easy to have a quick glass of iced water and to have ice cubes available at the family dinner table – for every member, young or old, to be able to serve themselves.
With two or three icebreakers in your freezer you can always give your guests iced drinks – even when you have a few friends over for dinner or a barbeque.
When it’s empty, just fill it back up and throw it back in the freezer. If it needs a wash, it’s dishwasher safe too.













Freight table












It would be easier to ask – who it’s NOT for! If you usually dread the moment someone asks for ice in their drink and you want to have easy ice cubes in your life every single day then icebreaker is a must have.It’s got mega-gift power too: 



For the man who has everything 

For the happy couple’s wedding gift 

For the ‘I don’t have a clue what to get him/her’ gift 


For the boss, it’s a Christmas gift that will impress.


It’s a talking point and a unique concept – who wouldn’t want to receive such an inspired gift?









We have made it easy for you to give away the new spectacular icebreaker. When you have ordered an icebreaker, just choose and print out the gift card most suitable for the occasion of your gift.

With a huge gap between automatic ice cube vending machines and ice cube trays and bags, I wondered when someone would come up with something better. They didn’t – so I took action! 
My name is Kim Jensen and I’m Danish. I am an engineer by profession and have years of experience of turning product ideas into final products, ready to ship. I quit my job with a big pharma company to work on this project for a year. I’d spent 13 years developing ideas and was ready to turn the plans and technical drawings into reality. After a year and several prototypes later – the icebreaker was born.


The icebreaker is designed for easy cleaning and assembly, simplicity and elegance. With a team of the best design and material engineers in Denmark who have reviewed and developed the icebreaker, my mantra has been 
‘It must work smoothly to overcome the obstacles that existing solutions offer.’


The icebreaker has been carefully engineered so that it can be produced from a few simple plastic parts and silicone gaskets. This makes it easy to clean and use, but maybe even more importantly, having a simple device is much more robust than a complex device. Actually, when you see it, you will say, ”why didn’t I think of that?” 
Each of these principles has had to be tested function by function, as a modular test, rather as a complete functional test, which would require all the parts to be molded and assembled to the final product. This has been a huge part of the development, but it has also revealed the challenges of making ice cubes inside a closed chamber. Careful considerations and solution of these challenges provided the foundation for our 5 patents.  
We would love to brag a bit more about how smart it is and how we made it, but due to the risk of copying, we have to keep some of the details close to our chests.









The icebreaker team is a team of volunteers and entrepreneurs with
mixed skills and experiences, who want to revolutionize the way that ice cubes
are made. The icebreaker was designed by the celebrated and multi disciplinary
Danish design house Bønnelycke Design
MDD.

Do I need to pour the coffee into a separate container?</strong></p><p>The Rite Press is designed to prevent over-extraction. When the filter is pressed to the bottom of a standard press, the extraction continues because there is a micro-current created in the press. The coffee at the side walls is slightly colder than that in the center of the press, and as result the coffee in the middle starts to rise and the coffee on the sides starts to fall. The two-part design of the Rite Press, combined with the silicone gasket, disrupts this process. The current in the Rite Press stays above the filter. To put it simply, Rite Press coffee is yummy for a long time.</p><p> </p><p> </p><div data-id=""19964088""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1519418733/czjjse30yozleguhlzxb.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><p> </p><div data-id=""19828205""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1519418734/yqfcnxmoz1bbp1stdsbo.png"" src=""""/></figure></div><p>Sargam is an engineer and visionary.

Our proprietary design makes coffee clean-up easy with a simple twist-off bottom. The stainless steel filter forces all the grounds into our patented removable bottom chamber, which twists off for easy cleaning.      Rite Press takes coffee making to the next level with a built-in thermometer, integrated hourglass timer and a removable bottom.    We’ve removed the guesswork from the perfect cup by adding the key features needed to deliver great tasting coffee consistently.  Burnt coffee is bad, having to read tiny numbers before you’ve had your first cup... also bad. Our custom designed and manufactured thermometer has a simple Blue, Green, Red scale. Blue is too cold and Red is too hot. The Green zone is centered at 200 degrees, which is the optimal temperature for a great cup of coffee.The Rite thermometer lives in the shaft of the filter so it’s easy to use and is always on hand.  Timing is everything, especially in a coffee press. Both under- and over-brewing lead to bad-tasting coffee. Our built-in and simple to use hourglass is set for precisely 3 min and 30 seconds. When the sand is done flowing, it’s time to press down the plunger and enjoy an amazing cup. The Rite timer is magnetically attached to the Rite Press.  French Press cleanup is notoriously annoying. We’ve solved that issue with our patented removable bottom, allowing you to conserve energy, water, and time.This solves the biggest French Press issue—cleanup! The bottom unscrews so you can easily dump the grounds and rinse with minimal effort. The precisely manufactured bottom is designed with two start positions allowing you to easily tighten the bottom with only one full turn. The Rite press also features a medical grade silicon seal to ensure the coffee or grounds don’t drip while in use.   The Rite Press delivers full-bodied coffee with rich flavor and keeps it hot for hours.The double wall construction keeps your coffee hot for up to two hours. Hang out with loved ones and enjoy hot coffee for much longer than a standard glass French Press.   The micro mesh filter allows a full-bodied brew for your coffee while keeping the coffee grounds pushed into the removable bottom.      The Rite Press is even great for loose leaf tea! Steep the tea in hot water and use the filter to push the tea leaves into the removable bottom for easy cleanup.   The Tea Kit features three sand timers set for the approximate times each type of tea should steep for. The sand is colored to keep selection of the Rite timer simple.Green Sand: Green Teas.Black Sand: Black and Red TeasWhite Sand: White, Flower and Oolong TeasThe thermometer highlights the different temperature ranges for each tea and will fit into the press in place of the Coffee thermometer.The Tea Kit will work for all Rite Presses in this campaign.     We selected our factory partners with great care. Each factory we use is inspected by the Rite team to ensure safe, responsible working conditions. Our factories meet and exceed all environmental production standards.        The Ceramic Rite Press is designed to enhance the beauty of your brewing ritual at every level. From the moment you open the box to reveal its classic lines... To the smooth feel of timeless ceramic under your hands... To the thousandth time you lift its elegantly balanced weight to pour your perfect cup... this Rite Press is a work of art in ceramics.We wanted to give our fans on Indiegogo a chance to get their hands on the Ceramic Rite Press before they hit the shelves.

If you wish to learn about the duties and taxes applicable to your shipment, you may want to check with the customs and border protection authority of your country. Q: Does Rite Press prevent over-extraction? Do I need to pour the coffee into a separate container?The Rite Press is designed to prevent over-extraction. When the filter is pressed to the bottom of a standard press, the extraction continues because there is a micro-current created in the press. The coffee at the side walls is slightly colder than that in the center of the press, and as result the coffee in the middle starts to rise and the coffee on the sides starts to fall. The two-part design of the Rite Press, combined with the silicone gasket, disrupts this process. The current in the Rite Press stays above the filter. To put it simply, Rite Press coffee is yummy for a long time.   Sargam is an engineer and visionary.

<h3>AMIAMO GLI AMARI!</h3>
<p>(That’s Italian for WE LOVE BITTERS!)</p>
<p>We are Tonic &amp; Tinctures Bitters Company - a small batch bitters company based out of Cambridge, NY.  Started by Anna Monaco and Michael Shane in late 2017, Tonic &amp; Tinctures (TNT for short) grew out of our desire to get on the production side of the alcohol business.  We have over 20 years of restaurant experience between us, and we decided it was time we made some delicious products for people to enjoy outside of the establishments we work in.</p>
<p>THUS WAS BORN TNT BITTERS!</p>
<p>We plan to start with four flavors of bitters:</p>
<p><i>THE ALIBI-</i> A combination aromatic and citrus bitter tailored made for the most debonaire of whiskey drinks - the Old Fashioned.</p>
<p><i>NAPALM IN THE MORNING -</i> A partnership with Iron Coffee in Hoosick Falls, NY brings us locally roasted coffee with which to make a bitter concoction not often seen.  A good pair with tequilas and mezcals.</p>
<p><i>PINK MIST</i>- Smoked grapefruit is a flavor we’ve been obsessing over for a while that has the potential to complete a myriad of drinks, but also could perfectly freshen up some soda water.  The bubbles - they go straight to my head!</p>
<p><i>A BETTER NAME THAN KAMIKAZE</i> - When Mike once asked Anna how to make a wasabi bitter, she responded “Very carefully.” So we decided to tone it back a bit, use horseradish for the heat instead, and pair it with ginger for that perfect balance.  Put this bitter in some sake or even throw it in your favorite peanut sauce for an extra flavor blast. IT’S EXPLOSIVE! (get it… TNT….)</p>
<p>Your contributions will help us buy the product we need to produce this first batch of bitters - what we call our IBO (Initial Bitters Offering).  We already have the space built and ready to go; the licenses are lined up; we even have a company ready to deliver gallons upon gallons of grain neutral spirit (GNS).  What we need is a little extra cash to put us over the threshold from concept to product and give us the wiggle room to make second batches when we get what we can only assume are going to be massive amounts of orders, ‘CAUSE IT’S A FREAKIN’ BITTERS EXPLOSION!</p>
<h3>THE BREAK DOWN</h3>
<p>Still interested?  You should be. Bitters are awesome.  We obviously think so. They are the piece of the recipe that complete the drink.  An Old Fashioned without bitters is just sugared whiskey. Have a Sazerac without Peychaud’s Bitters and it may still taste good, but you will be left with the ghost of a missing taste.  Those ghosts, those absent flavors are exorcised and filled by bitters.</p>
<p>In our quest to fill your flavor holes, we’re asking for $10,000 to help move TNT Bitters from the ethereal world into the physical.  Those funds will help us:</p>
<ul>
<li>Buy the herbs, spices, botanicals, and alcohol needed to produce the bitters ($4,000)</li>
<li>Finish product design, including logos, labeling, and other physical advertising materials; purchasing bottles and stoppers - the liquid has to go in something after all! ($1,500)</li>
<li>Launch website and shore up our web presence with some focused advertising using only the most sophisticated Russian bots ($500)</li>
<li>Additional equipment purchases - as we grow, we will need to get more sophisticated bottling equipment, additional herbs and spices (read down further for our growth ideas!), and other miscellaneous kitchen and bar purchases ($2,000)</li>
<li>Be traveling salesmen! We have to stomp the pavement to sell our goods. We both have an assortment of friends in an assortment of restaurant positions across the United States. This will also help cover the expenses of things like travel, trade shows, booths at local farmers markets, and other similar industry events in the area. ($1,000)</li>
<li>Cover the random detritus of life.  This would include things like repairs to the equipment and space, additional month or so of rent if production is slowed or product delayed, and other such miscellany that life inevitably throws at you.  ($1,000)</li>
</ul>
<p>If we fall short of our total goal, all funds will go towards the production of our first batch of bitters.  The sales from that would then help us reach our other goals, but in a slower fashion with less a of a cushion to work with.</p>
<h3>WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?</h3>
<p>As a mere cog in capitalism's massive machine, we understand, of course, that growth is king.  TNT Bitters plans to expand its line to include other batches such as a lavender bitter and a hops concoction (hopefully in partnership with local beer producer Brown’s Brewing Company).  We would like to partner with local farms to produce seasonal bitters as well.</p>
<p>In addition to the line of traditional bitters, we would like to branch into what we call Mists - a concentrated flavor with a spray top that one could use to mist over a glass to add a distinct aroma or place in a bathroom to hide an unwanted one.  Cedar, Peat, and Anise would be the three beginning scents.</p>
<p>Lastly, we will produce a seasonal small batch amaro (a bitter Italian liqueur) called the Washington Batch made with herbs and botanicals grown by the farms in Washington County, NY and the surrounding area.  (One of our perks reserves you a bottle!)</p>
<p>In the far future, we may get into the tonic section of our name and produce handcrafted sodas, syrups, and other cocktail or cooking additives.</p>
<h3>WHEN IS THIS BOMB GOING TO BLOW?</h3>
<p>Since we have overcome the nightmarish bureaucracy of federal and state alcohol boards, we are close to starting production.  Once we’ve gathered the ingredients and materials, production takes approximately 2 weeks to a month depending on the exact tincture we’re creating.</p>
<p>We hope to have product labeled and ready to leave our little hamlet of Cambridge, NY by October 2018.</p>
<p> A note on our perks - we cannot legally send alcohol in the mail.  Bitters falls in the strange grey area between alcohol and grocery, but to be on the safe side, we'll be mailing out vouchers for the perks that include reserved bottles.  These vouchers are good for all four bottles of our initial bitters offerings or the future amaro we will make.  You can pick them up from us directly in Cambridge if you're in the area or at any of the fairs, markets, or trade shows that we frequent.  Additionally, you could catfish us, get our home address, and accost us there, but let's not get the cops involved this soon in our relationship.</p>
<p>There will no doubt be hiccups (which bitters can help cure!), more bureaucracy, and other obstacles to overcome, but we have been through a number of ringers in our long and varied restaurant careers and always came out the other side upright and successful.  From throwing out drunks to designing full menus to managing huge staffs to opening restaurants from a concrete slab up, we’ve conquered it all without the help of explosives. BUT NOW WE’VE GOT TNT ON OUR SIDE!</p>
<h3>PLEASE SHARE EVEN IF YOU CAN’T DONATE!</h3>
<p>Even that small copy and paste will have us sending good booze karma your way.</p>
<p>Want to know more?  Here’s a little bit on bitters:</p>
<p><strong>What are bitters?</strong></p>
<p>Bitters are flavorful liquids that have been used for centuries. Often known as tonics or tinctures, they were first sold as cures for indigestion, headaches, heartburn, and other ailments. Eventually, they made it into the cocktail world, and today are mainly used as additions to drinks that help round out the flavor of a drink or add a surprising, powerful taste element. They are, in specifics, heavily flavored alcohol made with specific agents that cause them to become bitter.</p>
<p><strong>How are bitters made?</strong></p>
<p>Bitters are fairly simple to make, but very hard to perfect. They are made by steeping various herbs, spices, botanicals, and bittering agents in high proof alcohol for weeks at a time. The alcohol takes on the flavor of the plants that occupy the sealed container it shares space with and then is diluted by water, packaged in small containers, and sent off into the world.</p>
<p><strong>How are bitters used?</strong></p>
<p>As mentioned above, bitters are used as additive elements to cocktails. An Old Fashioned, for example, gets Angostura bitters (the largest bitters manufacturer's aromatic bitters). A Sazerac (America’s first cocktail) gets a few dashes of Peychaud's bitters (a red, anise flavored bitter). As the cocktail world has expanded, so has the selection of bitters. In addition to cocktails, bitters can be added to soda water to aid in digestion. Larger format bitters called Amari (bitters in Italian) serve as apertifs and digestifs. Bitters have even made it into the cooking world - for example as roasting elements for nuts or as flavorful additions to cookie recipes.</p>

<h3>The Bakery</h3>
<p>Blanche Bakery started serving delicious vegan baked goods one year ago. We have had so much support from the people of Cardiff in the last 12 months. We've expanded from online orders and events, to supplying some of the cities best-loved independent businesses, including Clancy's, Barkers and Beanfreaks; and we've recently opened our pop-up shop in the creative hotspot that is The Castle Emporium on Womanby Street. We've had the pleasure of working with some amazing local and international brands, businesses and charities including The Alzheimer's Society, Clic Sargent, Heads Above The Waves, Simple Knots Craft Club, Bump n Grind, Retrofest, Dirty Martini, Clayton Hotels and Toyota.</p>
<p><br/>We were lucky enough to be nominated for the 'Best Vegan Cake' award in the 2017 Vegan Awards. We're grateful for this recognition, as each of our cakes, cookies, brownies and doughnuts are lovingly handmade and decorated with quality ingredients. All of our products are 100% vegan and soya free, and can also be made gluten free. Our aim is to offer food that everyone can enjoy whilst not compromising on taste.</p>

<p align=""center""><strong>Keep Your Wallet and Your Guts Happy with Great Recipes, Kitchen Hacks, </strong></p>
<p align=""center""><strong>Money Saving Tips, Tips on Cooking for Dietary Restrictions, and Cool Techniques!</strong></p>
<p align=""center""><i>“A three course meal made on 2 hotplates and a toaster oven.”</i></p>
<p>I grew up watching my mother cook and wanting to be just like her. Her passion for food was infectious. I started cooking when i was 13 years old, and even then I had a tendency to modify the recipes that I was being taught. It was those first experiments that led to my very first coveted recipe - shepherd’s pie.</p>
<p>In my first year of university, frustrated with the monotony of cafeteria food on campus and student-poor, I created three course meals for me and my dorm-mates including once when I made a Greek salad with homemade dressing, braised beef with gravy, kluski (Polish Potato dumplings), and had some muffins baking for breakfast. All of which was prepared using 2 hotplates and a toaster oven. </p>
<p>When I was diagnosed with Crohn's, what was already a honed enthusiasm for food, turned into an obsession. My body became extremely picky about what I could and couldn't eat. Many preservatives turned out to be pain triggers and I became extremely sensitive to taste, smell, and texture. I became adept at modifying recipes to make them work with my strict Crohn's diet and to reduce my IBS pain. </p>
<p>In addition to having to deal with many diet restrictions, disability-imposed poverty meant that I had to operate within a relatively tight budget. Saving money became as important as making sure that I didn't set off or worsen flares. I learned how to preserve food while it was cheapest without the use of those preservatives or higher acidity that contribute to pain. </p>
<p>Over the years I had picked up a variety of skills as I worked both on finding recipes to accommodate my Crohn’s diet and to recreate some of my childhood favorites, including:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Canning and Pickling food</li>
<li>Making my own spices and spice mixes</li>
<li>Important basics like stocks, sauces, marinades, and dressings. </li>
<li>Breaking down a whole chicken, a whole beef tenderloin, and so forth.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a while now, my friends have been begging me to put together a cookbook.I want to write one that includes recipes of course, but also includes instructions on how to do fun things in the kitchen. </p>
<ul>
<li>Learn how to make and modify recipes to accommodate different dietary restrictions. How to make different treats from scratch in order to control the ingredients that get used.</li>
<li>Learn how to take advantage of local and summer produce to help save you money all year round.  </li>
<li>Learn how to make the most of your ingredients and make sure little or nothing goes to waste. How to use parts that are usually discarded to add additional flavor to your dishes. </li>
<li>Learn how to take advantage of high energy days to make meals ahead of time for when you are too tired to cook and can't afford to eat out. How to safely freeze and reheat ready-made meals, ingredients, and so much more. </li>
</ul>
<p>This cookbook will have something for everyone! </p>
<ul>
<li>Great recipes for anyone looking for fun new meal ideas</li>
<li>Lessons in different kitchen techniques to improve your cooking abilities</li>
<li>Tips on how to make Crohn's, IBD, and IBS friendly meals, and how to modify recipes to fit dietary restrictions - including tips on modifying recipes to make them lactose-free, dairy-free, gluten-free, and even occasionally vegetarian.</li>
<li>Tips on how to save money.  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>THE RUB? </strong></p>
<p>I am on disability, and my wife just graduated from her Ph.D and is currently unemployed. We barely have money for regular groceries and bills, let alone the sheer amount of ingredients needed to remake all the recipes in a short period of time - including while some of them are out of season. </p>
<p>I need to make them again in order to add pictures to the cookbook. I also usually cook by eye, and need to work on translating instinct into exact measurements.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1477805034/knmdauvcbvbf94o44tvb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>THE MENU OF GOALS</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>$500 – The Basic Cookbook </strong></p>
<p>This is the base amount I need in order to be able to purchase all the ingredients needed to make all of these recipes. It should enable me to take a series of pictures of the process with my phone. I will include as many different techniques that I can. I will provide instructions for people on how to modify recipes to make them work for their own dietary restrictions. The goal being to help people with Crohn's and other IBDs to be able to eat delicious food despite their digestive issues. </p>
<p><strong>The Perk: </strong>I will publish an eBook through Amazon.</p>
<p><strong>Stretch Goal the First - $750 – Put A Little Sausage In It! Also Cheese? </strong></p>
<p>I have all the necessary equipment, but making sausage, and bacon, and cheese requires some extras that can get pricey as they add up. The extra money will let me play with sausage recipes, make homemade bacon and culture cheeses other than ricotta, which in turn will help me with providing more options on how to modify recipes and existing foods to fit dietary restrictions.  By teaching people how to make their own sausages I hope to help people be able to create great ""going out"" foods. Help people with Crohn's and Dietary restrictions be able to join in on the campfire roasts, the bbq's and other social events. </p>
<p><strong>The Perk:</strong> All of these recipes and techniques will then be included in the book, for your own experimentation. In addition, I will record the adventure process on my blog for all to enjoy.</p>
<p><strong>ADDITIONAL PERK:</strong> If I reach this level I will publish one recipe a week on my blog until I finish writing the cookbook. </p>
<p><strong>Stretch Goal the Second - $1000 – Watch The Sausage Get Made. </strong></p>
<p>With that little extra help, I will be able to afford to get a camera as well as other equipment, and even potentially acquire a dedicated space I can use to show various recipe-making techniques on video. That’s right: in addition to a written cookbook, the extended goal will make it possible for me to start a video cookbook as well! This will in turn help people who can't afford a cookbook or have trouble learning from written pages. It will allow me to demonstrate things for people in a way that is accessible to a greater number of people. </p>
<p><strong>The Perk: </strong>In addition to writing and publishing the cookbook, I will make videos of all of the recipes one by one. This will give me the opportunity to show some of the skills I will do my best to describe in the cookbook.</p>
<p><strong>ADDITIONAL PERK</strong>: If I reach this level, I will publish one rough video of some cool technique or recipe before the end of November. </p>
<p><strong>Stretch Goal the Third -$1500 – Put Me On The Shelf.</strong></p>
<p>While I will be able to arrange for a hard copy book through Amazon, this extra bit of help means that I will be able to order some copies of the book to give out to bookstores and libraries locally. It will also allow me to sell copies at local author events, and through other venues. The money will also be used to sign up for services that will make it possible for me to get the book included in bookstore catalogs in major chains like Chapters-Indigo in Canada and Barnes &amp; Noble in the US.This will make it easier for more people living with Crohn's disease and IBS to find and benefit from it. <br/><br/><strong>The Perk: </strong>If I reach this goal, I will publish a blooper reel of mistakes and funny things that happen while recording the video cookbook. </p>
<p><strong>Stretch Goal the Fourth -$2000 – Call me Professor Onion.</strong></p>
<p>This money will be used to help set up classes at places like community centers, universities, and local colleges to offer starter cooking classes to people who want to learn. To start it would be mostly around Ottawa and surrounding areas, with possible trips to places like Kingston, Toronto, and Montreal.</p>
<p>The classes will include lessons to teach people how to can and preserve local food at home. This will allow people to support local farmers and save money at the same time. </p>
<p>It will also make it possible for me to start to put together an in-home party style class for people who want to get together with friends to learn how to make a cool dish.<br/><br/><strong>The Perk: </strong>If you are local, you will get free attendance at one of any of the classes, and depending on your donation level may even win you the chance to host a cooking party for a food of your choice. I will basically cook you dinner, and show you how I did it - For Free! </p>
<p><strong>Stretch Goal the Fifth - $10,000  – Take this Show on the Road! </strong></p>
<p>If I reach this goal, (or more) I will pack up my car with some of my gadgets and goodies, along with boxed copies of my book, and take the act on the road. I will visit provinces and states throughout Canada and the US and demonstrate some of my fun cooking techniques as well as sell copies of my book. </p>
<p>I will record the whole trip on my blog, including making videos of the different places I visit. The more money I raise, the more possibilities there are for where I can go and what I can do. </p>
<p><strong>The Perk: </strong>If you live in any of the places where I am able to visit, you will get free attendance at any of the classes, and depending on your donation level may even win you the chance to host a cooking party for a food of your choice. I will basically cook you dinner, and show you how I did it - For Free.</p>

My body became extremely picky about what I could and couldn't eat. Many preservatives turned out to be pain triggers and I became extremely sensitive to taste, smell, and texture. I became adept at modifying recipes to make them work with my strict Crohn's diet and to reduce my IBS pain. 
In addition to having to deal with many diet restrictions, disability-imposed poverty meant that I had to operate within a relatively tight budget. Saving money became as important as making sure that I didn't set off or worsen flares. I learned how to preserve food while it was cheapest without the use of those preservatives or higher acidity that contribute to pain. 
Over the years I had picked up a variety of skills as I worked both on finding recipes to accommodate my Crohn’s diet and to recreate some of my childhood favorites, including:  

Canning and Pickling food
Making my own spices and spice mixes
Important basics like stocks, sauces, marinades, and dressings. 
Breaking down a whole chicken, a whole beef tenderloin, and so forth.

For a while now, my friends have been begging me to put together a cookbook.I want to write one that includes recipes of course, but also includes instructions on how to do fun things in the kitchen. 

Learn how to make and modify recipes to accommodate different dietary restrictions. How to make different treats from scratch in order to control the ingredients that get used.
Learn how to take advantage of local and summer produce to help save you money all year round.  
Learn how to make the most of your ingredients and make sure little or nothing goes to waste. How to use parts that are usually discarded to add additional flavor to your dishes. 
Learn how to take advantage of high energy days to make meals ahead of time for when you are too tired to cook and can't afford to eat out. How to safely freeze and reheat ready-made meals, ingredients, and so much more. 

This cookbook will have something for everyone! 

Great recipes for anyone looking for fun new meal ideas
Lessons in different kitchen techniques to improve your cooking abilities
Tips on how to make Crohn's, IBD, and IBS friendly meals, and how to modify recipes to fit dietary restrictions - including tips on modifying recipes to make them lactose-free, dairy-free, gluten-free, and even occasionally vegetarian.
Tips on how to save money.  


THE RUB? 
I am on disability, and my wife just graduated from her Ph.D and is currently unemployed. We barely have money for regular groceries and bills, let alone the sheer amount of ingredients needed to remake all the recipes in a short period of time - including while some of them are out of season. 
I need to make them again in order to add pictures to the cookbook. I also usually cook by eye, and need to work on translating instinct into exact measurements.

THE MENU OF GOALS:
$500 – The Basic Cookbook 
This is the base amount I need in order to be able to purchase all the ingredients needed to make all of these recipes. It should enable me to take a series of pictures of the process with my phone. I will include as many different techniques that I can. I will provide instructions for people on how to modify recipes to make them work for their own dietary restrictions. The goal being to help people with Crohn's and other IBDs to be able to eat delicious food despite their digestive issues. 
The Perk: I will publish an eBook through Amazon.
Stretch Goal the First - $750 – Put A Little Sausage In It! Also Cheese? 
I have all the necessary equipment, but making sausage, and bacon, and cheese requires some extras that can get pricey as they add up. The extra money will let me play with sausage recipes, make homemade bacon and culture cheeses other than ricotta, which in turn will help me with providing more options on how to modify recipes and existing foods to fit dietary restrictions.  By teaching people how to make their own sausages I hope to help people be able to create great ""going out"" foods. Help people with Crohn's and Dietary restrictions be able to join in on the campfire roasts, the bbq's and other social events. 
The Perk: All of these recipes and techniques will then be included in the book, for your own experimentation. In addition, I will record the adventure process on my blog for all to enjoy.
ADDITIONAL PERK: If I reach this level I will publish one recipe a week on my blog until I finish writing the cookbook. 
Stretch Goal the Second - $1000 – Watch The Sausage Get Made. 
With that little extra help, I will be able to afford to get a camera as well as other equipment, and even potentially acquire a dedicated space I can use to show various recipe-making techniques on video. That’s right: in addition to a written cookbook, the extended goal will make it possible for me to start a video cookbook as well! This will in turn help people who can't afford a cookbook or have trouble learning from written pages. It will allow me to demonstrate things for people in a way that is accessible to a greater number of people. 
The Perk: In addition to writing and publishing the cookbook, I will make videos of all of the recipes one by one. This will give me the opportunity to show some of the skills I will do my best to describe in the cookbook.
ADDITIONAL PERK: If I reach this level, I will publish one rough video of some cool technique or recipe before the end of November. 
Stretch Goal the Third -$1500 – Put Me On The Shelf.
While I will be able to arrange for a hard copy book through Amazon, this extra bit of help means that I will be able to order some copies of the book to give out to bookstores and libraries locally. It will also allow me to sell copies at local author events, and through other venues. The money will also be used to sign up for services that will make it possible for me to get the book included in bookstore catalogs in major chains like Chapters-Indigo in Canada and Barnes & Noble in the US.This will make it easier for more people living with Crohn's disease and IBS to find and benefit from it. The Perk: If I reach this goal, I will publish a blooper reel of mistakes and funny things that happen while recording the video cookbook. 
Stretch Goal the Fourth -$2000 – Call me Professor Onion.
This money will be used to help set up classes at places like community centers, universities, and local colleges to offer starter cooking classes to people who want to learn. To start it would be mostly around Ottawa and surrounding areas, with possible trips to places like Kingston, Toronto, and Montreal.
The classes will include lessons to teach people how to can and preserve local food at home. This will allow people to support local farmers and save money at the same time. 
It will also make it possible for me to start to put together an in-home party style class for people who want to get together with friends to learn how to make a cool dish.The Perk: If you are local, you will get free attendance at one of any of the classes, and depending on your donation level may even win you the chance to host a cooking party for a food of your choice. I will basically cook you dinner, and show you how I did it - For Free! 
Stretch Goal the Fifth - $10,000  – Take this Show on the Road! 
If I reach this goal, (or more) I will pack up my car with some of my gadgets and goodies, along with boxed copies of my book, and take the act on the road. I will visit provinces and states throughout Canada and the US and demonstrate some of my fun cooking techniques as well as sell copies of my book. 
I will record the whole trip on my blog, including making videos of the different places I visit. The more money I raise, the more possibilities there are for where I can go and what I can do. 
The Perk: If you live in any of the places where I am able to visit, you will get free attendance at any of the classes, and depending on your donation level may even win you the chance to host a cooking party for a food of your choice. I will basically cook you dinner, and show you how I did it - For Free.",3.0,0,"4 Campaigns

</div></div><p>""Hi, I'm Gem and I'm the founder of VALA. Shortly after meeting my partner in Australia, we began running together at the end of our long working days. Enjoying the release and structure that exercise gave him, he quickly began training for marathons. Before his long runs, I watched him consuming preservative-packed and chemical-laden gels that were full of maltodextrin, over-processed syrups and acesulfame k. It seemed that exercising as act of love for his mind and body was being undone by these artificial gels and the numerous additives that they included. I resolved to change this and began making him gels from all natural ingredients.</p><p>A year later we moved back to London and after many positive reviews from athletes that had sampled VALA, I left my career as an Art Director in advertising to focus on VALA full-time. I have recently returned to Wales to build VALA and qualify as a personal trainer, so that I can begin offering free training to promote the benefits of exercising for mental health. Thanks so much for your support - it means the world to us.""</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1573812162/lvqu80313yw6evnuv1tz.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>If you're unable to pledge, you can show us some love on socials and share our campaign using the Indiegogo share tools.</p><p>Keep it touch and follow us on Instagram<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/valaenergy/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> @valaenergy</a> or sign up to the mailing list at <a href=""https://valaenergy.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">valaenergy.com</a>.</p><p>We really do value our backers as this wouldn’t be possible without your loyal support.

All of our factories, machinery manufacturers and suppliers are British based and we're working with BRC approved facilities.Your pledge will help us to cover our manufacturing and production costs, as well as costly legal fees. These include global trademarking and business insurance, which will ensure that VALA can reach athletes across the world. We aim to get VALA in the hands of athletes by the end of May 2020, so that they can be used throughout a summer of training for their sport of choice. Due to pending laboratory shelf-life tests, we are yet to release complete nutritional values.     We’re passionate about the positive impact that exercise has on mental health. That’s why we're aiming to donate a percentage of profits towards providing subsidised exercise classes in south Wales and promoting the benefits of exercise as a natural mood enhancer.  

 
""Hi, I'm Gem and I'm the founder of VALA. Shortly after meeting my partner in Australia, we began running together at the end of our long working days. Enjoying the release and structure that exercise gave him, he quickly began training for marathons. Before his long runs, I watched him consuming preservative-packed and chemical-laden gels that were full of maltodextrin, over-processed syrups and acesulfame k. It seemed that exercising as act of love for his mind and body was being undone by these artificial gels and the numerous additives that they included. I resolved to change this and began making him gels from all natural ingredients.A year later we moved back to London and after many positive reviews from athletes that had sampled VALA, I left my career as an Art Director in advertising to focus on VALA full-time. I have recently returned to Wales to build VALA and qualify as a personal trainer, so that I can begin offering free training to promote the benefits of exercising for mental health. Thanks so much for your support - it means the world to us.""If you're unable to pledge, you can show us some love on socials and share our campaign using the Indiegogo share tools.Keep it touch and follow us on Instagram @valaenergy or sign up to the mailing list at valaenergy.com.We really do value our backers as this wouldn’t be possible without your loyal support. If you have any questions, want to say hey or join us for a run/swim/ride in our stunning Welsh landscape, drop us a line at contact@valaenergy.com. We'd love to hear from you.We already have our factories, machinery, suppliers and legal representatives lined up, therefore we can go into production shortly after receiving backing. Shelf life testing accounts for a large portion of the timeline from January until March, as we want to ensure that VALA is shelf safe for athletes for as long as possible. We currently expect to ship our gels by the end of May 2020. Please note that our shipping fees do not include customs fees and the backer will be liable for paying these on receipt of their delivery. Our shipping costs cover shipping materials as well as shipping, to ensure that VALA reaches you in perfect condition.Potential delays that may occur include supplier, machinery, manufacturing and legal delays. However, we’re in constant contact with our contractors to ensure a seamless manufacturing process. We aim to be as transparent as possible and will keep you up-to-date every step, stroke and pedal of the way. We guarantee that you’ll be the first to see our gels come off the production line.",25.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>Minimal and different...that was the goal. There are some wonderful openers that poke holes in cans or double as a tool, this is not one of them. Removing screwdrivers and accessories was essential to create a bottle opener that can sit discreetly anywhere and still be efficient. Although compact, it’s never hard to find. Throttle Opener sticks to any magnetic surface due to the built-in powerful rare earth magnet and has a bottle shaped hole large enough for a key-ring.

<h3>Manufacturing</h3>
<p>Throttle Opener went through many versions. Because of 3D printing, I could quickly test and redesign to fine tune the look and function. After 3D printing in plastic,  I printed in steel to fully test the opener and get valuable feedback. Next, I found a manufacturer and order two openers that were made by machining sold pieces of steel, these were used for the images on this page. The two parts allowed me to test the quality of work from the manufacturer, but to also show buyers exactly what they would be receiving and eliminate some uncertainty that comes with crowd funding projects.</p>
<p>Throttle Opener will be made by pouring molten steel into molds, when cooled it will be sand blasted, brushed and then chrome plated in your choice of finish, natural, smoke or copper. Once I receive the openers I will attach a super strong rare earth magnet. I use a two part adhesive consisting of an epoxy resin and a hardener which is rated to hold up to 3,200 psi on non-flexible materials. Additionally, I have had prototypes over a year and have never had a problem; I have also tried to remove the magnets from the current prototypes without success.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481763740/ld3zdirqnyer7raiiumx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h3>Why Indiegogo InDemand</h3>
<p>You Spoke, I Listened.Throttle Opener is here today because of the awesome feedback I received over the past year. Comments from sites such as Reddit and Kickstarter helped to validate the demand and give design suggestions, such as using steel instead of aluminum and to add a keyring hole.

The Napoli Multi-Fueled Outdoor Pizza oven is the solution to this problem. The Napoli is the most affordable, high quality, portable, multi-fueled outdoor pizza oven available. In addition to pizza, you can cook a wide variety of foods, including meat, fish, vegetables and dessert pizzas. This oven is extremely fun and addictive to use, provides amazing tasty Charcoal cooked, gas cooked, or Wood Fired results. This oven is lightweight and extremely portable, allowing you to take it with you to virtually any outdoor setting. Achieve restaurant quality results in your own backyard with the Napoli Multi-fueled outdoor pizza oven!</p><p>Being able to at temperatures of over 900 degrees Fahrenheit (much hotter than your standard in house oven) allows you to achieve a crisp outside, tender inside and perfect crust.</p><p><strong>So Why Choose the Napoli?</strong></p><p>Typical outdoor pizza ovens are large, non-portable and can cost thousands of dollars. </p><p>Competitors that do offer smaller portable ovens, typically offer only one source of fuel for heating the oven, such as wood pellets. The Napoli Oven is multi-fueled, which means you can use wood pellets, charcoal, wood or gas. Competitors that do offer multi-fueled ovens charge over $600 for their units. During this campaign, you will have the opportunity to purchase the Napoli Multi-Fueled Pizza Oven for less than half that price, starting with our early bird special at $349!

The Napoli Multi-Fueled Outdoor Pizza oven is the solution to this problem. The Napoli is the most affordable, high quality, portable, multi-fueled outdoor pizza oven available. In addition to pizza, you can cook a wide variety of foods, including meat, fish, vegetables and dessert pizzas.

During this campaign, you will have the opportunity to purchase the Napoli Multi-Fueled Pizza Oven for less than half that price, starting with our early bird special at $349!

<h3>Overview </h3>
<p>Having good food options is at the core of building a healthier and happier lifestyle and being that plant-based eating is showing monumental results in healing people, we offer the food people already love and choose to eat in a fast and casual setting.</p>
<p>That’s where SomethinGood To Eat comes in. The restaurant serves plant-based versions of fast-food favorites, with the menu including “Good Nuggets” (a chickpea-based substitute for chicken nuggets), “Royal Burgers” (black bean burgers), “Good Burgers” (lentil burgers), and other items like barbecue jackfruit sandwiches, sweet potato fries and more. On the beverage menu, SomethinGood To Eat offers smoothshakes -- a cross between smoothies and milkshakes, using house-made oat milk. Recognizing that SomethinGood is sometimes hard to find with the overwhelming amount of options in this world, we wanted to cut through the noise and make finding something good simpler.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>How the Money Will be Used </h3>
<p>So Far SomethinGood has been all self-funded, We were mostly making everything that will be on the menu at home, every day, for the last few years. It got to a point where it was the right direction to make this a public offering because many people were struggling to find easy access to healthy options whether they were plant-based or omnivorous. We currently have a space we are developing in the heart of Cleveland Larchmere district. We hope to purchase new equipment, produce marketing collateral, and continue to grow our business, and help people through food. We have some amazing rewards for campaign patrons! If you're unable able to support financially, please consider sharing our campaign!</p>

<h4><b>Why Are Paleo and Allergy Free Chocolates Important?</b></h4>
<div>If you know or love someone with an allergy or food intolerance you will know how difficult (often impossible!) it can be to find delicious chocolates to gift them with.  </div>
<div>Allergies and food intolerances can make life difficult, and being denied one of life's greatest pleasures can REALLY get on your nerves, trust me, I know! I wanted to be able to eat great chocolates knowing that they weren't going to make me ill, and I wanted my husband to be able to buy me an exciting box of chocolates for Easter or Christmas. We looked, but there was nothing out there, so I had to create them myself.</div>

<br/>
</div>
<div>So far I've had 2 customers who have NEVER had a box of chocolates in their entire life, because of allergies. Those customers were absolutely over the moon to find that they could, for the first time ever, be indulged. One customer was so thrilled to be able to buy her husband his first ever box of chocolates she almost cried! It really is THAT life changing, crazy though it may seem if you are used to being able to buy any box of chocolates you desire.</div>
<div>More and more people are becoming aware of how their diet affects their health, but no matter how great you are at sticking to a hard core healthy eating plan, you are still going to want to factor in treats. My philosophy is that denying yourself treats is a sure fire route to misery; it's far better to know that you can choose treats that aren't going to make you ill than to binge eat the things that you know aren't good for you. </div>
<div>All of our chocolates and bars are made without refined sugar, dairy, soy, nuts, sesame seeds, grains, gluten and eggs making them suitable for the vast majority of allergy sufferers - of course there will always be those who suffer from unusual allergies, and if I can, I will always do whatever I can to accommodate you - just talk to me.</div>

<h2>Our Story</h2>
<p>Looking to fill a void in the stagnant rye whiskey market, Air Force veteran Michael Manfredonia founded Gunnison Valley Distillery to bring the bold and unique flavor of malted rye to whiskey lovers across The Gunnison Valley, Colorado, and beyond.  Unlike other rye whiskey, 100% of our rye grain goes through the malting process - a process traditionally reserved for barley.  This break from tradition allows us to stand apart from other whiskey, while the rye grain provides instant familiarity.</p>
<p>Donating today allows us to continue our journey of bringing some delicious whiskey to Gunnison.  While our whiskey will continue to age without this campaign, it will do so out-of-state in a different climate - creating an entirely different taste than barrels aged in Gunnison.  Additionally, we won't be able to add additional barrels to our inventory, increasing the likelihood that this 2 year cycle will repeat itself once we are able to sell our current batch.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h2>Our Needs</h2>
<p>This is where we layout the crazy amount of money a project like this needs and where your dollars go.  All funds raised will go towards 3 primary categories:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1601617785/g7nt6duh9ifook1qzrbx.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<ul>
<li>More Whiskey<ul><li>This includes more barrels, as well as the equipment and materials necessary to blend and bottle the whiskey once it finishes ageing</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Renovations<ul>
<li>Any property we lease will need significant upgrades to be approved for storage of whiskey barrels</li>
<li>We also need some chairs, a bar, and some decorations for the tasting room so you can sip and enjoy our whiskey in comfort</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Shipping<ul><li>Every barrel we fill needs to be delivered to our eventual warehouse</li></ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The exact dollar amounts for each of these categories is flexible, but we are estimating $20,000 for property renovations and $15,000 for shipping our barrels.  This leaves $40,000 for more barrels and a small bottling line.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What's in it for you</h2>
<p>Every donation, no matter how big or small, means the world to us - and hopefully you as well.  But that doesn't mean we can't give you something in return for your generosity.  We are offering perks that range from $10 to $10,000 and provide something for every level of interest.</p>
<h3>Drinks for Life!</h3>
<p>That sounds awesome.  For residents of the valley, frequent visitors, or anyone that enjoys knowing where a free drink will be, a donation of $1000 ($1250 if you miss the early bird rate) makes you eligible for our feature perk.  2 free drinks per day for life.  Once our tasting room is open, as long as we have whiskey, you'll have a drink!</p>
<h3>Drinks and Bottles</h3>
<p>Of course, many people won't be able to donate that much, so we're also offering perks that include a bottle of whiskey or a single drink in the tasting room.</p>
<ul>
<li>Voucher for a 2 year aged bottle of whiskey<ul>
<li>For $55 (or $50 if early bird perks are still available) you can get a voucher good for our 100% rye malt whiskey, aged 2 years.</li>
<li>For $150, you can get one of our first 100 bottles.  These will be a completely different bottle style and come in a wood crate package to celebrate the area's rich mining history.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Voucher for a 4 year aged bottle of whiskey<ul><li>Six of our barrels are being held for longer ageing - 4 years.  For an $85 donation, you can receive a voucher for one of these bottles.  These will be the first barrels of our ultimate flagship product line.<br/> </li></ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>Beyond all of the really cool perks you can choose from, why should you donate?  The answer is simple, community.  Our first step after this campaign is bringing our barrels to Gunnison, and then building out our tasting room.  With our whiskey on everyone's radar, locals and tourists alike are liable to spend more time where it matters - with each other and with Gunnison's small business community.</p>
<p>Colorado is well-known for being a leader in craft beer and is increasingly becoming known for craft spirits.  The Gunnison valley is well known for being one of the best spots in the state for outdoor recreation year-round.  Our distillery looks to marry these two institutions, providing a unique opportunity for tourists and locals alike to enjoy more of their interests and hobbies in-town.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>Starting a distillery is not without significant challenges.  Stills and other equipment are expensive, facilities need to be built to particular specifications due to the nature of high proof alcohol, and whiskey ageing takes time.  Additionally, moving to and living in the valley brings its own set of challenges - but also some amazing rewards and benefits.</p>
<p>With regards to this campaign, should we not raise enough money, we will still have the barrels we've already filled, but will have to find a new path to bringing them to Colorado, filling bottles, and entering into sales and distribution.  This path increases the likelihood of overall failure as it doesn't help us truly build the brand as a Gunnison-based product.</p>
<p>Our path to success starts with this campaign.  By raising the money we need to bring our barrels to Gunnison, we build that sense of community and stay true to the foundations this company was built on.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>
<p>Every bit helps.  This could be through donating, or through simply spreading the word about our campaign.  Whether you are able to donate or not, mention this to your friends and family, tell a neighbor, tell the next 4 people you see on the street.  It all helps.</p>
<p>Don't forget, you can always follow us on Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook - and so can everyone you just told about our funding campaign.</p>
<p>So donate, or don't.  Tell your friends, or don't. Swing by our email or social media and say hi, or don't.  No matter what you do, we appreciate you and the time you've taken to get here.  So thank you.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

That sounds awesome.  For residents of the valley, frequent visitors, or anyone that enjoys knowing where a free drink will be, a donation of $1000 ($1250 if you miss the early bird rate) makes you eligible for our feature perk.  2 free drinks per day for life.  Once our tasting room is open, as long as we have whiskey, you'll have a drink!
Drinks and Bottles
Of course, many people won't be able to donate that much, so we're also offering perks that include a bottle of whiskey or a single drink in the tasting room.

Voucher for a 2 year aged bottle of whiskey
For $55 (or $50 if early bird perks are still available) you can get a voucher good for our 100% rye malt whiskey, aged 2 years.
For $150, you can get one of our first 100 bottles.  These will be a completely different bottle style and come in a wood crate package to celebrate the area's rich mining history.


Voucher for a 4 year aged bottle of whiskeySix of our barrels are being held for longer ageing - 4 years.  For an $85 donation, you can receive a voucher for one of these bottles.  These will be the first barrels of our ultimate flagship product line. 



The Impact
Beyond all of the really cool perks you can choose from, why should you donate?  The answer is simple, community.  Our first step after this campaign is bringing our barrels to Gunnison, and then building out our tasting room.  With our whiskey on everyone's radar, locals and tourists alike are liable to spend more time where it matters - with each other and with Gunnison's small business community.
Colorado is well-known for being a leader in craft beer and is increasingly becoming known for craft spirits.  The Gunnison valley is well known for being one of the best spots in the state for outdoor recreation year-round.  Our distillery looks to marry these two institutions, providing a unique opportunity for tourists and locals alike to enjoy more of their interests and hobbies in-town.
 

Risks & Challenges
Starting a distillery is not without significant challenges.  Stills and other equipment are expensive, facilities need to be built to particular specifications due to the nature of high proof alcohol, and whiskey ageing takes time.  Additionally, moving to and living in the valley brings its own set of challenges - but also some amazing rewards and benefits.
With regards to this campaign, should we not raise enough money, we will still have the barrels we've already filled, but will have to find a new path to bringing them to Colorado, filling bottles, and entering into sales and distribution.  This path increases the likelihood of overall failure as it doesn't help us truly build the brand as a Gunnison-based product.
Our path to success starts with this campaign.  By raising the money we need to bring our barrels to Gunnison, we build that sense of community and stay true to the foundations this company was built on.
 

Other Ways You Can Help
Every bit helps.  This could be through donating, or through simply spreading the word about our campaign.  Whether you are able to donate or not, mention this to your friends and family, tell a neighbor, tell the next 4 people you see on the street.  It all helps.
Don't forget, you can always follow us on Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook - and so can everyone you just told about our funding campaign.
So donate, or don't.  Tell your friends, or don't. Swing by our email or social media and say hi, or don't.  No matter what you do, we appreciate you and the time you've taken to get here.  So thank you.

<p>The Renegade community is quite big already- so many amazing people who have supported us both financially and emotionally.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Update - there's still a chance to join us!</h3>
<p><strong>It's been a great campaign, a big thank you to all the contributors!</strong></p>
<p>Being a tea farmer has turned out to be more popular than we expected - all the initial tea bushes and mini tea estates have found an owner! We didn't really plan on adding any new plots, but since many of you have still showed interest to join us on this journey, we thought of how we could do it. </p>
<p>After cleaning the Mandikori Estate, we have discovered that some areas do not have sufficient amount of old tea plants and new ones need to be planted. As we are excited ourselves to see how the new plants develop compared to the older ones, we thought that this could be something we could share with you as well. So, we put up <strong>a new perk</strong> offering a chance to be a patron for <strong>a mini tea estate planted just for you</strong> - you can see how the tea bushes develop over time and similarly to the other owners of tea estates, you will receive 50% of the produce made on those areas. We will prepare the land during the winter and start planting new plants in the spring of 2019. The initial batch of tea will be ready in 2020.</p>
<p>There's also a chance to own <strong>a tea plant which is planted just for you</strong> - you can see how it grows from scratch and develops over time. We will plant them in the spring of 2019.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""> </h2>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">We are the Renegades and we want to revive the Georgian tea industry.</h2>
<p><br/>Georgia - the country, not the state in USA! Georgia is a small country in the borderlines of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1524991466/kh3ojubbdvusui7bpb4p.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Many people probably do not know that it is possible to grow tea in Europe, but Georgia has actually some of the best conditions in the world to produce high-quality organic tea. 30 years ago, western Georgia was one of the main tea producing regions in the world. At the peak, the tea industry employed <strong>more than 150 000 people </strong>and green, lush plantations covered tens of thousands of hectares. <strong>And then it collapsed almost completely in just 5 short years.</strong> Tea plantations were abandoned, huge factories closed and whole regions lost their employment as Georgia was dealing with the aftershocks that the fall of Soviet Union sent through the region. Half of those plantations have been destroyed or uprooted during the past years, but the other half is still there today– overgrown with fern, blackberries and small trees, waiting for someone who would give them a second life.</p>
<p>Becoming tea farmers has not been our lifelong dream. But the story of Georgian tea and its surreal collapse intrigued us so much that we decided to do something about it. We left our jobs<strong> </strong>as leaders and specialists in the corporate world in Estonia and Lithuania to give our part in saving the Georgian tea industry. We also understood that today's global tea industry is focused on mass production and you rarely really know where your tea is coming from - we saw a chance to change it and to bring more personality and authenticity to the world. That's how<a href=""http://www.renegadetea.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> Renegade Tea Estate </a>was born.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1526475626/ffdjwrzquudkcx6kskb3.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Local people in Mandikori village</i></p>
<p>It is highly motivating for us to give a second lease of life to something that has been abandoned and rendered useless. We really hope that we can also bring a little bit of positivity and life back to the villages of Imereti by providing jobs in our plantations. In addition, the idea that in the future we can drink tea which is harvested from our own Estate, which was saved from oblivion, is something that gives us energy every day. With this fundraising we want to share this experience with others - you can have your personal small tea garden and together with it help to save a part of the Georgian tea industry. </p>
<p><strong>Be a part of the Renegade story and let's put Georgian tea back on the map again!</strong></p>

</div><div>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">What we have done so far and why we need your support </h2>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1526474121/gexdsv5pgepair465jgl.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Local people working in Renegade Tea Estate</i></p>
<p>We have made initial investments to get us going. After checking more than 50 abandoned tea plantations across the whole western Georgia, some of which even the locals had forgotten, we ended up choosing 2 to start with. </p>
<p>One of them had initial cleaning completed over the winter and as the new shoots are growing, we plan to get our first small harvest from there this summer. In April we started to remove weeds from our second plantation and from there we hope to collect the first harvest in 2019. We have made an investment to buy the necessary equipment to clean and cultivate the plantations and machinery to produce tea.</p>
<p>The biggest challenge so far has been to find a suitable building for the factory. Almost every industrial building nearby our tea fields had been either demolished or ruined. Building something from scratch was also not an option due to time constraints. Then we found an old unused warehouse in the middle of another abandoned tea plantation. Its location was near perfect and experts confirmed that the main construction is still strong. It requires a lot of resources to set it up as a modern tea factory, but we ended up concluding that it is probably our best option to go forward. Now it belongs to us.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1524829829/zlvly6dx3pqoezjqcb8y.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Future factory building</i></p>
<p><br/>As told, this old building is right in the middle of another old tea plantation. We feel that given our goals it would be really unfortunate for our factory to be surrounded by abandoned and bushy tea fields, waiting to be saved. Taking the third estate at this stage was however not part of our initial plans. What we can invest ourselves will be used up by continuing the rehabilitation of the first two plantations and making some essential works to renovate the building and set up the factory to start with production.</p>
<p>And then the idea came that maybe there are others who would be ready to support us on this journey and help us to put the Georgian tea back on the world map. We could take the third plantation for rehabilitation and fully complete the renovation of the factory if there would be more of us. Renegades who would join in and help us to get the whole process up and running.</p>
<p>We estimate that rehabilitating the third estate and setting up the factory as a modern and certified factory for organic tea will cost ca 150 000 euros during the next few years.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Where the funds will go</h2>
<p><br/>With this fundraising, we aim to raise ca <strong>30,000 euros</strong>. (Unfortunately we are not able to have the campaign in euros, so the goal is in US dollars - 40,000 USD)</p>
<p>The funds will go to:<br/><br/><strong>- rehabilitating Rioni Estate in 2019</strong> – cleaning the plantation next to the factory from weeds, bushes, and trees, reviving the rows of tea bushes and cultivating the soil. Altogether 10,5 hectares.<br/><br/><strong>- completing the restoration of the old building and setting the factory up according to food safety regulations</strong> - the main frames of the building are strong and usable, everything else needs to be redone (roof, walls, floors etc.). We plan to divide the building into 4 rooms - production area, warehouse, dressing room for workers and a small office. </p>
<p><strong>- drilling a well to secure a stable supply of clean water </strong>- at the moment there is no reliable water supply or drainage system in the building.  </p>

<p><br/>If we will raise more than our goal is, then we will use the money for: </p>
</div></div></div></div>
<p><strong>- building a proper technical facility at Renegade Estate </strong>- we need to build a service building to each of our Estates to store the equipment, provide good conditions to our workers (toilets, rooms for changing clothes and having lunch) and to temporarily keep the leaves after harvesting. </p>
<p><strong>- keeping the Rioni Estate plantation clean from weeds</strong> - after the initial cleaning we still need to clean the fields regularly so tea plants could grow freely. To keep the plantations clean, we need to have<b> 1 person for each two hectares </b></p>
<p><strong>-fertilizing the plantations- </strong>after being neglected for 30 years, the soil is pure, but lacks nutrients, so the tea plants need some additional help from fertilizers to grow healthy and strong. <strong>NB! We use biofertilizers only.</strong></p>
<p><strong>-food safety certificate </strong>- we will build everything according to the food safety regulations, but acquiring the certificate itself is another expensive process.</p>
<p><strong>-fixing the roads going to our other plantations - </strong>at the moment the Renegade and Mandikori Estates are accessible only with a four-wheel drive car. We will fix it so it would be easier to transport the leaves and we would also be able to invite quests to visit the Estates in the future. </p>
<p>If we don't reach the funding goal, we will use the collected funds to complete the renovation of the factory.  </p>
<p> </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Rioni Estate</i><br/> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>What you will get</strong></h2>
<p><br/>So, what is our proposal? For your contribution, we offer you<strong> a personal tea garden </strong>within the same Estate that will be rehabilitated with your help. We will mark a 100 m² plot, put your name on it and every year we will send you 50% of the tea that was produced there. The first tea will be ready at the end of the summer of 2019. In the first years the quantities are smaller, but after 3-4 years, when the bushes are fully grown, that's about 3-5 kg of tea per year. You and your whole family can enjoy high-quality organic tea from your own tea estate and don't have to buy tea ever again. How does that sound?</p>
<p>If this is a too big of a commitment at the moment, you can still support our cause by just trying out <strong>our first tea (100g=40-50 cups of tea)</strong> that we will produce this year or by selecting any of the other perks. </p>
<p>If you want to go even further, you could create <strong>your own small tea brand </strong>together with us. <br/>There is an especially cool half-wild part of our Mandikori Estate with steep hills and ancient trees. Tea bushes in this area are exposed to unique conditions, unlike in any other area in our plantations. If you are willing to dedicate your time regularly and be at least somewhat involved in our daily processes, we could develop this area into a separate tiny plantation and create a unique line of teas made only from the leaves from this area and sold under a separate sub-brand that we develop together with you. </p>
<p>We also welcome you to visit us - meet us and see the Renegade Tea Estate in real yourself!</p>

</div></div>","With 230 backings we raised $31,973!
Thank you all for supporting us!
 
 
Update - we extended the campaign for 10 days!
The Renegade community is quite big already- so many amazing people who have supported us both financially and emotionally. Thank you!But as you see, we have not reached the goal unfortunately. Since we really need to gather at least $30,000 to finish the planned works at the factory, we decided to prolong the fundraising for 10 more days.
We hope we can gather the missing amount during this time. Help us to make it happen! 

 
Update - there's still a chance to join us!
It's been a great campaign, a big thank you to all the contributors!
Being a tea farmer has turned out to be more popular than we expected - all the initial tea bushes and mini tea estates have found an owner! We didn't really plan on adding any new plots, but since many of you have still showed interest to join us on this journey, we thought of how we could do it. 
After cleaning the Mandikori Estate, we have discovered that some areas do not have sufficient amount of old tea plants and new ones need to be planted. As we are excited ourselves to see how the new plants develop compared to the older ones, we thought that this could be something we could share with you as well. So, we put up a new perk offering a chance to be a patron for a mini tea estate planted just for you - you can see how the tea bushes develop over time and similarly to the other owners of tea estates, you will receive 50% of the produce made on those areas. We will prepare the land during the winter and start planting new plants in the spring of 2019. The initial batch of tea will be ready in 2020.
There's also a chance to own a tea plant which is planted just for you - you can see how it grows from scratch and develops over time. We will plant them in the spring of 2019.

 
We are the Renegades and we want to revive the Georgian tea industry.
Georgia - the country, not the state in USA! Georgia is a small country in the borderlines of Europe and Asia.

Many people probably do not know that it is possible to grow tea in Europe, but Georgia has actually some of the best conditions in the world to produce high-quality organic tea. 30 years ago, western Georgia was one of the main tea producing regions in the world. At the peak, the tea industry employed more than 150 000 people and green, lush plantations covered tens of thousands of hectares. And then it collapsed almost completely in just 5 short years. Tea plantations were abandoned, huge factories closed and whole regions lost their employment as Georgia was dealing with the aftershocks that the fall of Soviet Union sent through the region. Half of those plantations have been destroyed or uprooted during the past years, but the other half is still there today– overgrown with fern, blackberries and small trees, waiting for someone who would give them a second life.
Becoming tea farmers has not been our lifelong dream. But the story of Georgian tea and its surreal collapse intrigued us so much that we decided to do something about it. We left our jobs as leaders and specialists in the corporate world in Estonia and Lithuania to give our part in saving the Georgian tea industry. We also understood that today's global tea industry is focused on mass production and you rarely really know where your tea is coming from - we saw a chance to change it and to bring more personality and authenticity to the world. That's how Renegade Tea Estate was born.

Local people in Mandikori village
It is highly motivating for us to give a second lease of life to something that has been abandoned and rendered useless. We really hope that we can also bring a little bit of positivity and life back to the villages of Imereti by providing jobs in our plantations. In addition, the idea that in the future we can drink tea which is harvested from our own Estate, which was saved from oblivion, is something that gives us energy every day. With this fundraising we want to share this experience with others - you can have your personal small tea garden and together with it help to save a part of the Georgian tea industry. 
Be a part of the Renegade story and let's put Georgian tea back on the map again!
 

What we have done so far and why we need your support 
 

Local people working in Renegade Tea Estate
We have made initial investments to get us going. After checking more than 50 abandoned tea plantations across the whole western Georgia, some of which even the locals had forgotten, we ended up choosing 2 to start with. 
One of them had initial cleaning completed over the winter and as the new shoots are growing, we plan to get our first small harvest from there this summer. In April we started to remove weeds from our second plantation and from there we hope to collect the first harvest in 2019. We have made an investment to buy the necessary equipment to clean and cultivate the plantations and machinery to produce tea.
The biggest challenge so far has been to find a suitable building for the factory. Almost every industrial building nearby our tea fields had been either demolished or ruined. Building something from scratch was also not an option due to time constraints. Then we found an old unused warehouse in the middle of another abandoned tea plantation. Its location was near perfect and experts confirmed that the main construction is still strong. It requires a lot of resources to set it up as a modern tea factory, but we ended up concluding that it is probably our best option to go forward. Now it belongs to us.
 

Future factory building
As told, this old building is right in the middle of another old tea plantation. We feel that given our goals it would be really unfortunate for our factory to be surrounded by abandoned and bushy tea fields, waiting to be saved. Taking the third estate at this stage was however not part of our initial plans. What we can invest ourselves will be used up by continuing the rehabilitation of the first two plantations and making some essential works to renovate the building and set up the factory to start with production.
And then the idea came that maybe there are others who would be ready to support us on this journey and help us to put the Georgian tea back on the world map. We could take the third plantation for rehabilitation and fully complete the renovation of the factory if there would be more of us. Renegades who would join in and help us to get the whole process up and running.
We estimate that rehabilitating the third estate and setting up the factory as a modern and certified factory for organic tea will cost ca 150 000 euros during the next few years.
 
Where the funds will go
With this fundraising, we aim to raise ca 30,000 euros. (Unfortunately we are not able to have the campaign in euros, so the goal is in US dollars - 40,000 USD)
The funds will go to:- rehabilitating Rioni Estate in 2019 – cleaning the plantation next to the factory from weeds, bushes, and trees, reviving the rows of tea bushes and cultivating the soil. Altogether 10,5 hectares.- completing the restoration of the old building and setting the factory up according to food safety regulations - the main frames of the building are strong and usable, everything else needs to be redone (roof, walls, floors etc.). We plan to divide the building into 4 rooms - production area, warehouse, dressing room for workers and a small office. 
- drilling a well to secure a stable supply of clean water - at the moment there is no reliable water supply or drainage system in the building.  
See more about the factory from the video:


If we will raise more than our goal is, then we will use the money for: 

- building a proper technical facility at Renegade Estate - we need to build a service building to each of our Estates to store the equipment, provide good conditions to our workers (toilets, rooms for changing clothes and having lunch) and to temporarily keep the leaves after harvesting. 
- keeping the Rioni Estate plantation clean from weeds - after the initial cleaning we still need to clean the fields regularly so tea plants could grow freely. To keep the plantations clean, we need to have 1 person for each two hectares 
-fertilizing the plantations- after being neglected for 30 years, the soil is pure, but lacks nutrients, so the tea plants need some additional help from fertilizers to grow healthy and strong. NB! We use biofertilizers only.
-food safety certificate - we will build everything according to the food safety regulations, but acquiring the certificate itself is another expensive process.
-fixing the roads going to our other plantations - at the moment the Renegade and Mandikori Estates are accessible only with a four-wheel drive car. We will fix it so it would be easier to transport the leaves and we would also be able to invite quests to visit the Estates in the future. 
If we don't reach the funding goal, we will use the collected funds to complete the renovation of the factory.  
 

Rioni Estate 
What you will get
So, what is our proposal? For your contribution, we offer you a personal tea garden within the same Estate that will be rehabilitated with your help. We will mark a 100 m² plot, put your name on it and every year we will send you 50% of the tea that was produced there. The first tea will be ready at the end of the summer of 2019. In the first years the quantities are smaller, but after 3-4 years, when the bushes are fully grown, that's about 3-5 kg of tea per year. You and your whole family can enjoy high-quality organic tea from your own tea estate and don't have to buy tea ever again. How does that sound?
If this is a too big of a commitment at the moment, you can still support our cause by just trying out our first tea (100g=40-50 cups of tea) that we will produce this year or by selecting any of the other perks. 
If you want to go even further, you could create your own small tea brand together with us. There is an especially cool half-wild part of our Mandikori Estate with steep hills and ancient trees. Tea bushes in this area are exposed to unique conditions, unlike in any other area in our plantations. If you are willing to dedicate your time regularly and be at least somewhat involved in our daily processes, we could develop this area into a separate tiny plantation and create a unique line of teas made only from the leaves from this area and sold under a separate sub-brand that we develop together with you. 
We also welcome you to visit us - meet us and see the Renegade Tea Estate in real yourself!

<p>Hi! I'm Graham. I love ice cream.  But don't we all, really?        <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509744798/dzizldkp3y8coe8u4qo8.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I became inspired to open an ice cream business after visiting Ireland in the spring of 2017. Irish ice cream (mostly soft serve) is incredible. It's because <i>all</i> the dairy in Ireland is grass fed. I meant all of it. I couldn't bear the idea of leaving grass-fed ice cream behind in Ireland; I wanted to share it with my community. So I decided to make it happen. Soon after, I left a ten year career in sustainable food and online grocery and Bluegrass Creamery was born.</p>
<p>I called upon an amazing crew of friends and supporters, and after a few months of work over the summer and fall of developing recipes (several hundred tests) and piloting production, we're ready to begin slinging cones full time at IX Art Park in Charlottesville come early April.</p>
<p>But now we need your help for our final push. <strong>We're asking for your support by buying ice cream and other goodies in advance.</strong> <strong>No gimmicks here! Every pledge is backed by real product at retail price! </strong></p>
<p>Your support now is an essential ingredient to bringing Bluegrass Creamery to life, and with it, healthy, out-of-this-world ice cream for everyone, regardless of dietary needs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1519156432/aivcegfpdfonuqkg7gsk.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>As we first launch, we're keeping things quite simple. We believe the wholesome quality of the products and their ingredients will complement that simplicity to delight just about everyone. With time, we hope to add more flavors, toppings and products as customers demand and our little stand will allow.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1519139275/obqb37ix8rroqkpxckom.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>* Want more topping choices? See our stretch goals, below! You can also <a href=""mailto:feedback@bluegrasscreamery.co?subject=Bluegrass%20Creamery%20Feedback"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">tell us</a> if you want other topping choices. We would love to hear from you!</p>
<p>**We plan to phase some of these products in over the first six months of operations.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<p>We use simple, wholesome recipes with as few ingredients as possible, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grassfed and organic milk and cream from Trickling Springs Creamery (from Maryland and Pennsylvania, which is as local as you can get for grassfed organic)</li>
<li>Organic, homemade, nut milks</li>
<li>Organic, fair-trade, raw, unrefined cane sugar</li>
<li>Organic maple syrup</li>
<li>Organic and/or pastured eggs (local, when possible)</li>
</ul>
<p>We also use organic and local ingredients whenever possible in our flavorings, toppings and cones.</p>
<p>Please find below a list of ingredients in our ice cream and cones:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1519589604/z0rhr2ld2rummco7sruw.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p><strong>We can launch this business with $5,000 of pre-sales community support.</strong> This will cover launch cost such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>First months rent at IX</li>
<li>Starting inventory</li>
<li>Some important remaining mechanical work on the bus and</li>
<li>A few new pieces of equipment we need</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>Stretch Goals</h3>
<p>While $5k would be dandy, our sincere hope is to raise $10 -$15K. As a result, we're implementing at least <strong>two stretch goals</strong> (if we break through those two, we may well add more!). If we raise more up front, it will allow us:</p>
<ul>
<li>A healthy operating cushion for our first months</li>
<li>To hire help and expand hours</li>
<li>Add more complexity to our business in the form of added toppings, etc.</li>
<li>Room for the delightful marketing we've dreamt up, and random acts of kindness for the community</li>
</ul>
<p>See here our stretch goals, and the super-special universal perks (everyone wins!) they unlock:</p>

<p>Pledging is easy! Just look to the right. We've got a variety of exciting perks available to you. Most of it is ice cream. Every pledge (except for ""big thanks"") comes with real stuff attached at retail prices. Our ask is simple: believe in us enough to help us make this real and you'll receive, in short order, first dibs on the best ice cream in town, as well as scoops and heaps and swirls of our gratitude.</p>
<p><strong>Important notes:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>All cones referenced in perks are defined as our ""little size.""</li>
<li>We will ship/give you tokens equal to the amount of cones noted in your perk. You can then exchange these tokens for cones.</li>
<li>Everyone who pledges at any level will be automatically entered into a drawing for 1 month of free ice cream.</li>
</ol>
<p>We hope to ship all pledges in late March or April. If you live in Charlottesville and would like to pick your pledge up at the stand during our opening week, we can do that too! It's probably also the fastest way to get your whipped products.</p>
<p>Shipping will cost either $1 or $2, depending on the pledge.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Pledging For Out-Of-Towners</h3>
<p>Do you want to support the Bluegrass Creamery vision, but don't live in Charlottesville? The ice cream cones included in your pledge tier can be donated to our <strong>pay-it-forward fund. </strong>These cones will be given when someone has had a terrible day -- the kind of day when an anonymously gifted ice cream cone might make a real difference.</p>
<p>We are also considering shipping ice cream if we get enough interest.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Referral Contest</h3>
<p>We have launched a referral contest so you can enjoy free ice cream! And recently, we updated the contest rules to make it even easier to get free ice cream!</p>
<p>You can participate and win in two ways:</p>

Hi! I'm Graham. I love ice cream.  But don't we all, really?        
I became inspired to open an ice cream business after visiting Ireland in the spring of 2017. Irish ice cream (mostly soft serve) is incredible. It's because all the dairy in Ireland is grass fed. I meant all of it. I couldn't bear the idea of leaving grass-fed ice cream behind in Ireland; I wanted to share it with my community. So I decided to make it happen. Soon after, I left a ten year career in sustainable food and online grocery and Bluegrass Creamery was born.
I called upon an amazing crew of friends and supporters, and after a few months of work over the summer and fall of developing recipes (several hundred tests) and piloting production, we're ready to begin slinging cones full time at IX Art Park in Charlottesville come early April.
But now we need your help for our final push. We're asking for your support by buying ice cream and other goodies in advance. No gimmicks here! Every pledge is backed by real product at retail price! 
Your support now is an essential ingredient to bringing Bluegrass Creamery to life, and with it, healthy, out-of-this-world ice cream for everyone, regardless of dietary needs.
 

As we first launch, we're keeping things quite simple. We believe the wholesome quality of the products and their ingredients will complement that simplicity to delight just about everyone. With time, we hope to add more flavors, toppings and products as customers demand and our little stand will allow.
 

* Want more topping choices? See our stretch goals, below! You can also tell us if you want other topping choices. We would love to hear from you!
**We plan to phase some of these products in over the first six months of operations.
 
Ingredients
We use simple, wholesome recipes with as few ingredients as possible, including:

Grassfed and organic milk and cream from Trickling Springs Creamery (from Maryland and Pennsylvania, which is as local as you can get for grassfed organic)
Organic, homemade, nut milks
Organic, fair-trade, raw, unrefined cane sugar
Organic maple syrup
Organic and/or pastured eggs (local, when possible)

We also use organic and local ingredients whenever possible in our flavorings, toppings and cones.
Please find below a list of ingredients in our ice cream and cones:

 


We can launch this business with $5,000 of pre-sales community support. This will cover launch cost such as:

First months rent at IX
Starting inventory
Some important remaining mechanical work on the bus and
A few new pieces of equipment we need

 
Stretch Goals
While $5k would be dandy, our sincere hope is to raise $10 -$15K. As a result, we're implementing at least two stretch goals (if we break through those two, we may well add more!). If we raise more up front, it will allow us:

A healthy operating cushion for our first months
To hire help and expand hours
Add more complexity to our business in the form of added toppings, etc.
Room for the delightful marketing we've dreamt up, and random acts of kindness for the community

See here our stretch goals, and the super-special universal perks (everyone wins!) they unlock:


 

Pledging is easy! Just look to the right. We've got a variety of exciting perks available to you. Most of it is ice cream. Every pledge (except for ""big thanks"") comes with real stuff attached at retail prices. Our ask is simple: believe in us enough to help us make this real and you'll receive, in short order, first dibs on the best ice cream in town, as well as scoops and heaps and swirls of our gratitude.
Important notes:

All cones referenced in perks are defined as our ""little size.""
We will ship/give you tokens equal to the amount of cones noted in your perk. You can then exchange these tokens for cones.
Everyone who pledges at any level will be automatically entered into a drawing for 1 month of free ice cream.

We hope to ship all pledges in late March or April. If you live in Charlottesville and would like to pick your pledge up at the stand during our opening week, we can do that too! It's probably also the fastest way to get your whipped products.
Shipping will cost either $1 or $2, depending on the pledge.
 
Pledging For Out-Of-Towners
Do you want to support the Bluegrass Creamery vision, but don't live in Charlottesville? The ice cream cones included in your pledge tier can be donated to our pay-it-forward fund. These cones will be given when someone has had a terrible day -- the kind of day when an anonymously gifted ice cream cone might make a real difference.
We are also considering shipping ice cream if we get enough interest.
 
Referral Contest
We have launched a referral contest so you can enjoy free ice cream! And recently, we updated the contest rules to make it even easier to get free ice cream!
You can participate and win in two ways:

For every single friend you refer who back the campaign, you'll get an extra ice cream cone added to your perk for FREE. i.e. if 3 of your friends back us,  you get 3 extra cones (limit 5 extra cones per referrer).
The person who refers the most backers will win 1 free month of ice cream!

In order for us to track your referrals, you must:

<p>As someone who has experienced homelessness, I know that finding your next meal can be one of the biggest sources of stress, and options are limited by the lack of safe food storage. To that end, I am in the process of creating a home cottage bakery at my new house, with an initial focus on baking banana bread to donate to the homeless. I plan to sell my product at farmer's markets and the like as well, and for every loaf I sell I will donate one loaf directly to a homeless person.</p>
<p>At this point you may be thinking, why banana bread? In addition to being one of my favorite things to bake, banana bread is healthy, filling, and most importantly, shelf stable for at least 48 hours at room temperature, which makes it more ideal for any population without effective food storage options. Furthermore, I believe it is a wonderful comfort food that can bring a smile to anyone's face, and if I can provide even fleeting moments of happiness to those in need, I will consider that a success.</p>
<p>I am baking mostly by hand right now, which will soon be untenable given the scope of what I would like to accomplish. This campaign will help me to raise initial funds raised to go towards taxes/insurance ($500), licensing/Indiegogo fees ($500), donated loaves/ingredients/equipment ($500), and of course paying for all of the Indiegogo perks ($1,000).</p>

<p>Cupple was designed to help stop plastic bottles and throw away cups from ending up in the environment.</p>
<p>By filling and re-filling your Cupple water bottle and not buying throw away single use bottles when you are out and about, you will help reduce the 8 million tons of plastic bottles which end up in the oceans each year. </p>
<p>By using your Cupple cup when you would like a coffee or tea on the go, you will help save some of the 6.5 million trees which are cut down each year to make throw away disposable coffee cups, which are each used for an average time of just 15 minutes.</p>

<h3> Did you know?</h3>
<ul>
<li> <strong>1 million</strong> plastic drinks bottles are bought around the world <strong>every minute</strong> </li>
<li>  <strong>480 billion</strong> plastic bottles are sold worldwide <strong>each year</strong> </li>
<li> <strong>16 billion</strong> disposable coffee cups and lids are used <strong>each year</strong> </li>
<li>Fewer than <strong>10% of coffee cups</strong> are recycled as their plastic lining makes it difficult and expensive</li>
<li>Less than half of the plastic bottles purchased are recycled – the rest end up in landfill sites, burnt or littered and often end up in rivers and waterways that flow into the sea</li>
</ul>
<p>The Cupple team want to <strong>encourage people to abandon single-use paper cups and plastic bottles</strong> as they create damaging waste which harms the planet for hundreds of years. </p>

<p>The design is simple and unobtrusive, and the form modest.  We have used pure stainless-steel  for the main components, with just a hint of colour reflecting the strength, beauty and honesty of nature: our inspiration for Cupple.</p>
<p>At 256 mm tall, Cupple can easily fit in a shopping bag, baby carry, gym bag or a backpack.   The cup is the perfect size for coffee machines (12oz), its double wall will keep drinks hot, and it is easy to drink from the drip proof silicone lid whilst on the go. </p>
<p>Cupple is designed to be easy to keep clean. The  uncomplicated lines and simple components ensure that there are no hard to reach corners or hidden joints.  As with many stainless steel products, we recommend hand-washing with dishwashing soap or liquid.  We find that using a bottle brush ensures a clean finish to all the surfaces.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our focus for the past 18 months has been on producing the best version of Cupple with the minimum of risk for our supporters and backers. The Aetha team have spent hundreds of hours in product development, planning, and producing 3D printed prototypes. Our manufacturing partner has worked with us to ensure maximum efficiency and quality for every part throughout the production process. They have already started building the machine tools for Cupple so that we can proceed immediately once we have raised the funding.</p>
<p>The greatest risk to our project at this stage would be a disruption at the manufacturer's factory. If a solution could not be found with our existing manufacturer, we would have to seek a new partner, which could take a number of months to secure, given our high standards and quality requirements. The whole Cupple team is committed to providing outstanding customer service at all times. We have consulted widely to identify and mitigate risks to the project.</p>
<p>We plan to deliver our rewards to our backer community as shown on the timeline. If we do encounter any delays, we will communicate to all our backers straightaway. It is very important to us to keep our backers updated and repay the faith they have shown in our product by being open and honest about Cupple at all times. 2020 saw the pandemic across the world disrupt international businesses. We have included potential further worldwide disruption in our planning but we will always put the health and safety of our team and that of our partners at the forefront of our mission.</p>

Meet Cupple: the water bottle with a twist
 
Cupple is a revolutionary, reusable, all-in-one cup+bottle.  Simple and convenient for people on the go.  Beautifully designed to save space and make your lives less complicated, whilst also reducing dependence on single use plastic.

Cupple is a combined 525ml (18oz) stainless steel water bottle AND a 340ml (12oz) double walled, vacuum insluated stainless steel coffee cup with a drip proof lid.  The cup and lid are cleverly hidden away in an outer sleeve for clean, safe storage.  Simply twist the bottle and outer sleeve to reveal the coffee cup and lid.

Cupple was designed to help stop plastic bottles and throw away cups from ending up in the environment.
By filling and re-filling your Cupple water bottle and not buying throw away single use bottles when you are out and about, you will help reduce the 8 million tons of plastic bottles which end up in the oceans each year. 
By using your Cupple cup when you would like a coffee or tea on the go, you will help save some of the 6.5 million trees which are cut down each year to make throw away disposable coffee cups, which are each used for an average time of just 15 minutes.
We are Amanda and Eve, two cousins who live close to each other in the UK. We share the same concerns about the planet and want to make a positive contribution towards reducing litteer and removing waste from the environment.  We would love you to CuppleUp with us to make a difference!
Cup+Bottle=Cupple
 

Cup and bottle together - ready for when you want to use them
 

Cupple is a combined 525ml (18oz) stainless steel water bottle AND a 340ml (12oz) double walled, vacuum insulated stainless steel coffee cup with a drip proof lid. The cup and lid are cleverly hidden away in an outer sleeve for clean, safe storage. Simply twist the bottle and outer sleeve to reveal the coffee cup and lid.
Cupple is the perfect ‘on the go’ companion - a stylish product enabling you to hydrate, and enjoy hot and cold drinks whilst out and about. 

Cupple is the perfect bottle to carry while commuting - fits in a bag or tote
Not just another water bottle 
Tired of carrying separate bulky reusable cups and bottles?  Not any more... 
Cupple makes using a reusable water bottle and coffee cup easy and convenient, replacing both single use plastic bottles and disposable cups in one neat product. 

The design is super sleek and easy to use. It has been built to fit into a tote bag or standard backpack. Perfect for your daily commute, the school run, whilst on holiday, or out and about on shopping trips around town, to the countryside, local shops or beach.
Cupple is for everyone: easy to open, easy to use, easy to carry. 

The cup and lid are hygienically sealed inside the outer sleeve ensuring your cup is clean and ready to use whenever you want.

Cupple is ideal for commuters
Over 4 million people took up cycling during lockdown in the UK alone so we ensured that Cupple was designed to fit the standard bike water bottle cage. It also fits into car cup holders, buggy cup holders and most other cup holders you can think of.

Cupple is designed to fit in a bike bottle cage
At Cupple, we've made the reusable bottle and coffee cup so easy to carry, that you can go zero waste and lighten your load at the same time. 

Stop using plastic water bottles which end up in the sea + washed up on the beach
 Fill. Drink. Reuse. 
 

Fill up before you leave home
STOP plastic bottles from ending up in the environment.  Save yourself over £250* each year by filling and re-filling your Cupple water bottle and not buying water in throw away bottles when you are out and about. (* based on UK average purchases) 
 

Re-fill when out and about - no need for single use plastic
HELP prevent millions of trees being cut down each year to make paper cups, which are used for just 15 minutes - the average time it takes to drink a tea or coffee. Stop those same paper cups going to landfill, littering our towns and countryside, or ending up in the oceans.
 

Cupple champions reusable coffee cups
Using a Cupple will actively help to prevent the production and use of plastic water bottles and plastic lined paper cups, and the subsequent disposal challenges they create.
Cup + Bottle = Convenience
 
No more stress of juggling two awkward drinks containers through the day. 
 

Cupple carry loop is ideal to hang off your back pack
With Cupple, you just keep the combination together for a simpler life. 

Ideal commuting product
Cupple is better for the environment
“We are frustrated by the amount of single-use plastic and litter generally. We feel there must be a more convenient solution to enable people to reduce their waste footprint whilst out and about.”
""Cupple is a different way and it's a better way.”  Amanda, Co-Founder 
 Did you know?

 1 million plastic drinks bottles are bought around the world every minute 
  480 billion plastic bottles are sold worldwide each year 
 16 billion disposable coffee cups and lids are used each year 
Fewer than 10% of coffee cups are recycled as their plastic lining makes it difficult and expensive
Less than half of the plastic bottles purchased are recycled – the rest end up in landfill sites, burnt or littered and often end up in rivers and waterways that flow into the sea

The Cupple team want to encourage people to abandon single-use paper cups and plastic bottles as they create damaging waste which harms the planet for hundreds of years. 

We're including A FREE carry loop with every Cupple which is made from recycled nylon webbing. The carry loop means Cupple is even easier to carry or attach to your backpack while out and about or on your daily commute.
 
Our environmental commitment
We recognise that we alone cannot change behaviour so we are Cuppling up with others as it’s through partnerships we can make a difference:

Providing end of first life solution for all Cupples to ensure they never end up in landfill but are recycled into a 2nd life product. We are working with The First Mile to develop a Woodland Trustrecycling solution for our products.
Ensuring carbon neutral manufacture, shipping, website and delivery 
We are donating to the Woodland Trust to help support the creation, protection and restoration of UK woodland.  
We are contributing to the Marine Conservation Society which works to ensure the seas are healthy, clean and protected. 

 

The last reusable bottle you will ever need to buy - choose Cupple, the one that does everything.
 
Cupple: performance and simplicity
 
Cupple ® is trademarked and the design registered in the UK and China, with registration pending in Europe and the US. The patent-pending design with the coffee cup silicon lid hidden in the base of the outer sleeve is unique: it ensures the lid is kept clean and hygienic at all times. 

Great for train journeys
The design is simple and unobtrusive, and the form modest.  We have used pure stainless-steel  for the main components, with just a hint of colour reflecting the strength, beauty and honesty of nature: our inspiration for Cupple.
At 256 mm tall, Cupple can easily fit in a shopping bag, baby carry, gym bag or a backpack.   The cup is the perfect size for coffee machines (12oz), its double wall will keep drinks hot, and it is easy to drink from the drip proof silicone lid whilst on the go. 
Cupple is designed to be easy to keep clean. The  uncomplicated lines and simple components ensure that there are no hard to reach corners or hidden joints.  As with many stainless steel products, we recommend hand-washing with dishwashing soap or liquid.  We find that using a bottle brush ensures a clean finish to all the surfaces.

Simple and uncomplicated - no hard to reach corners

Well, Fortunella is a Kumquat based spirit of 40° ABV  intended as a base spirit in cocktails or pure as a digestive. Kumquats originate in Asia and look like an orange, egg-shaped citrus fruit. Being the only citrus fruit with a consumable peel, they are a wonderful fruit for making a spirit. Their flavour profile is a combination of sweet, sour and floral notes. In the finished product this results into a very aromatic spirit: fruity character surrounded by the fragrance of the essential oils. On the first sip you capture the rich mouthfeel with a full-bodied kumquat flavour. The long maceration captures all the essential oils giving this soft touch to the tongue, pleasant perfume with a long finish of citrus and cardamom. </p><p>Three years ago, Frederic joined a cocktail competition. During his testing he ended up creating the very first version of Fortunella. A little while later he decided to get help, joining forces with Thomas and Kamill. After 2 years we can finally say we have a product to be proud of.</p><p>We macerate the kumquats in brandy for 3 months. Afterwards we distill the liquid and add some cardamom. All in purpose of the amazing citrus aromas and fruity flavours you get from the kumquats. </p><p>Why did we decide on making Fortunella? We know for a fact that citrus in all its shapes and sizes is one of the most loved fruits. Especially in the cocktail world. We captured the fresh and aromatic essence you get from the kumquats. A truly new and innovating spirit.</p><p>A little bit more about the creators. Frederic Geirnaert is a bartender working in Jigger’s Coolers &amp; Cocktails in Ghent. He has a passion for creativity and innovation. Thomas Devenyn is a chemist educated in Food Science. Kamill Cosemans is a talented photographer and graphic designer. The three of us have been working on Fortunella for two years already, trying to make our product perfect.</p><p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">To make this story a reality we need help. Producing &amp; selling a spirit in Belgium is not easy and costly. That’s why we’re asking you to help us. Of course we don’t want your money for free. We are offering you a chance to buy the first bottles or some merchandise. Quid pro quo.</span></p><p> </p><p><strong>What we need &amp; what you get</strong></p><p>Our target for this campaign is 7000 euros. With this money we want to invest more money in our production. Production wise, the more money we can collect, the larger amount of Fortunella we can make, the cheaper we can sell it to you. Win win right? </p><p>Why would we be any better than someone else trying to make you an alcoholic?</p><p>Frederic is a skilled bartender who already has a wide array of cocktails waiting for you guys. From something plain and simple to something high end and unique. It’s time for change! These days we crave for innovation. </p><p> </p><p><strong>The impact</strong></p><p>We want to contribute a new, high-quality product for your enjoyment. Our vision for the future is to make a whole new range of crazy spirits. </p><p>The rest depends on the bartenders and chefs to get even more crazy with Fortunella.

Well, Fortunella is a Kumquat based spirit of 40° ABV  intended as a base spirit in cocktails or pure as a digestive. Kumquats originate in Asia and look like an orange, egg-shaped citrus fruit. Being the only citrus fruit with a consumable peel, they are a wonderful fruit for making a spirit. Their flavour profile is a combination of sweet, sour and floral notes. In the finished product this results into a very aromatic spirit: fruity character surrounded by the fragrance of the essential oils. On the first sip you capture the rich mouthfeel with a full-bodied kumquat flavour. The long maceration captures all the essential oils giving this soft touch to the tongue, pleasant perfume with a long finish of citrus and cardamom. Three years ago, Frederic joined a cocktail competition. During his testing he ended up creating the very first version of Fortunella. A little while later he decided to get help, joining forces with Thomas and Kamill. After 2 years we can finally say we have a product to be proud of.We macerate the kumquats in brandy for 3 months. Afterwards we distill the liquid and add some cardamom. All in purpose of the amazing citrus aromas and fruity flavours you get from the kumquats. Why did we decide on making Fortunella? We know for a fact that citrus in all its shapes and sizes is one of the most loved fruits. Especially in the cocktail world. We captured the fresh and aromatic essence you get from the kumquats. A truly new and innovating spirit.A little bit more about the creators. Frederic Geirnaert is a bartender working in Jigger’s Coolers & Cocktails in Ghent. He has a passion for creativity and innovation. Thomas Devenyn is a chemist educated in Food Science. Kamill Cosemans is a talented photographer and graphic designer. The three of us have been working on Fortunella for two years already, trying to make our product perfect.To make this story a reality we need help. Producing & selling a spirit in Belgium is not easy and costly. That’s why we’re asking you to help us. Of course we don’t want your money for free. We are offering you a chance to buy the first bottles or some merchandise. Quid pro quo. What we need & what you getOur target for this campaign is 7000 euros. With this money we want to invest more money in our production. Production wise, the more money we can collect, the larger amount of Fortunella we can make, the cheaper we can sell it to you. Win win right? Why would we be any better than someone else trying to make you an alcoholic?Frederic is a skilled bartender who already has a wide array of cocktails waiting for you guys. From something plain and simple to something high end and unique. It’s time for change! These days we crave for innovation.  The impactWe want to contribute a new, high-quality product for your enjoyment. Our vision for the future is to make a whole new range of crazy spirits. The rest depends on the bartenders and chefs to get even more crazy with Fortunella. There are a lot of possibilities and this is only the start.  Risks & challengesIt’s not gonna be easy, excise duties and taxes are rough in Belgium.It’s a big advantage that our team consists of 3 very different people with a very particular skill set.

<h3>A Good Problem to Have!</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Jeff Corle, that's me and my friend Bindy in the pic.  I'm a <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Pleasant-View-Dairy-110272370852564"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">4th generation dairy farmer located in the Laurel Mountains of Pennsylvania</a>.  A short time ago, after selling my larger organic dairy herd, I started over again with a much smaller herd of 4 Guernsey cows.  My goal was simply to farm and milk cows part-time and to bottle a high quality, full-fat, creamtop, A2A2 milk in glass bottles and sell it directly to the public.   The demand for my milk immediately exceeded what the 4 cows could make, so I quickly doubled in size to 8 cows.  Much to my surprise,  the demand for my milk has now far exceeded that which the 8 cows can produce.  It’s time to expand again - 'cause we're selling out all the time.  <strong>A good problem to have!</strong></p>
<p>Along the way, the cows and I have enjoyed watching a community form around our milk.  We call them Pleasantviewers.  Although they come from diverse backgrounds, they share one thing in common: they are mindful of what they put in their bodies!   As such, they have a strong desire to consume real food and real unadulterated whole milk!</p>
<p>This campaign will fund our expansion by helping us buy more cows and bigger, more efficient processing/bottling equipment to keep our ever growing community of Pleasantviewers supplied with real milk!</p>
<p>Having more milk will also allow us to branch out and offer other dairy products such as <strong>chocolate milk, </strong>drinkable yogurt and kefir.</p>

<p>We want to add 4 sweet Guernsey cows to our herd so we'd go from our current 8 cows to 12 cows.  (We may even add a few more if we exceed our funding goal.)</p>

<p>Folks, we bought the storage shed that makes our farm stand on the no money down, easy peezy, rent to own plan.  You know the one... the one where you end up paying twice as much for the shed as its original price, ouch!  But, what can I say, we needed it and we've gotten so many great comments about the building that I definitely think it was worth it.   But, I want to pay it off and save all that money to put back into the farm somewhere else.  </p>
<p>The shed will be the last item we check off our list because the additional cows and equipment are most important to moving us forward.  But If we reach our goal and can pay the shed off, we'll have a mortgage burning (rent-to-own contract burning?) ceremony at our farm open house this spring.  Maybe we'll even invite a lucky contributor to light the match!

<p>Folks, we thought if we're going to ask you to help us buy cows, we need to offer some fabulous perks and more so,  give you the chance to participate in a very real way.  Here's what we've come up with.   Buckle your seatbelts and hold on, it's gonna be a wild ride!!</p>
<p><strong>$250 Sponsor a Newborn Calf  </strong>What better way to show your support for Pleasant View Dairy than by sponsoring new life and future herd members!  Your sponsorship will include a sponsorship certificate, a calf information sheet including the calf's name, birthdate, pedigree, and health information, regular updates about your calf, regular visits with your sponsored calf, and most fun of all - a professionally done photograph of you/your family with your sponsored calf.  Price includes whole family.  (Great project for kids!)</p>
<p><strong>$350 Name a Newborn Calf  </strong>So, we figure if they can sell the naming rights to stadiums, why can't we sell the naming rights to calves! And besides, calves are much cuter than stadiums and way cheaper to name! As calves are born this spring and summer you will have the opportunity to name that calf whatever you want (within reason people) and lay claim to the fact that as that calf grows into an adult that <strong>YOU</strong> named it!  </p>
<p><strong>$500  Calf Sponsorship/Calf Naming Rights Combo  </strong>So what's better than sponsoring a calf?  How about being able to name the calf you sponsor!  Choose this combo perk and save $100 over buying separately.</p>
<p><strong>$1500 Sponsor a Cow  </strong>This is the big one folks!  This is your chance - perhaps the only chance you will ever have in your lifetime -  to be part of the purchase of a cow.  I personally love this idea because over time as the community of Pleasantviewers has emerged, so many people have told me how much they love the cows.  This is your chance to have a very unique, very real, very tangible connection to one of God's most important gifts to humanity, the humble dairy cow. </p>
<p>Your sponsorship will include a cow sponsorship certificate, a cow information sheet with her birthdate, pedigree (if known), registration number, health information, regular updates about your sponsored cow, regular visits with your cow and a professionally made photograph of you/your family with your sponsored cow.  I also figure if you pay for me to buy a cow you ought to get some milk from her! Although I have no way to  separate out the milk specifically from your sponsored cow, I can give you the milk she helps produce.  So, your sponsorship will include a year's supply of milk (1 gallon per week 52 weeks)  </p>
<p><b>$2500 The Whole Enchilada  (Triple Cheese, of course!) </b>Like everything you see but can't decide on which level to contribute?  Problem solved... get the whole enchilada!  This level gets you all the perks listed including cow sponsorship <strong>with one neat little added feature</strong>.  If you choose this level we will reserve your sponsored cow's calf to be the calf that you sponsor and name.  Imagine the excitement as your sponsored cow's due date approaches, knowing that you will be sponsoring and naming the calf she gives birth to.  Talk about a fun and worthwhile family project!     </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Community</h3>
<p>Who'd have thought the simple act of putting whole, unadulterated, full-fat milk in a glass bottle would cause such a stir and give birth to such a wonderful new community?  I sure didn't.  I just wanted to milk cows again and sell the best milk I could make in glass bottles.  But as more and more people found us and came to love our milk, new friendships were formed and those friendships formed the foundation of a new community.  I never really thought about it, but before we started doing this, people in our area didn't even have the option to buy this kind of milk.  Full-fat, creamtop (yes it separates so shake it!) milk in glass bottles simply did not exist here before we started.   Now it does and it's really neat to think that people have gone out of their way and changed their buying habits to get our milk.  (Does that make me and the cows disrupters?!  We are indeed disrupting the usual super fast, super cheap, super processed, super junk food supply chain?!)  When folks find us they are genuinely super enthusiastic about our milk and that enthusiasm is quite contagious!  Community forming contagious, in fact!  </p>
<p>From the many people who tell us they couldn't drink milk before but can drink ours, to the folks who are nostalgic for the creamtop or the glass bottles or both, to the many young people who report to us that they had no idea that this was what real milk was supposed to be like,  to the folks who love the idea of getting away from plastic, it all adds up to the new community of Pleasantviewers. </p>
<p>For me,  the community aspect was totally unexpected and a total blessing in my life.  Funny to think that our farm stand has become a gathering place for this community just like an old general store.  I love hearing people compare notes about how they use the milk and catch up with each other.  Coming out to the farm - on Saturday especially -  has become a social event for many Pleasantviewers!</p>
<p>So if you're already a Pleasantviewer, thanks a million for your support.  If you haven't tried our milk yet, I hope you will and I  hope you'll join us on our journey and become a part of this crazy community!</p>
<p>                                                                                                                     Jeff Corle, March 27, Windber, PA </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>[This section contributed by Wildlife Biologist and loyal Pleasant View customer, Tammy Colt.]</p>
<p>Impact? This project has impact like an asteroid! Food shortages during the COVID-19 crisis have reminded us about the importance of local food and given us a renewed appreciation of the American farmer. For many Pleasant View customers, picking up delicious, fresh milk in glass bottles, right at the farm, brings a sense of nostalgia. Local food used to be the norm, sad fact is it's a rarity these days!  And those Guernsey Girls’ A2A2 milk is super healthy, allowing some people who’ve had to give up milk to feel like a kid again. </p>
<p>Pleasant View milk is healthy for the environment, too.  Instead of shipping from farm to processing plant to then be distributed by big trucks to grocery stores, where it’s finally purchased by the consumer, their milk is sold directly from the farm.  Less transportation = smaller carbon footprint (or hoofprint?)  And those returnable glass bottles aren’t just nostalgic—they replace that dreadful single-use plastic.  And because this milk is farm fresh and not homogenized, it can be made into yogurt, cottage cheese, butter, ricotta, queso . . . wait, I’m getting hungry . . .that’s a whole garbage can full of single-use plastic replaced! </p>
<p>But wait there’s more! Did you know that North America has lost 50% of its grassland birds in the last half-century?  What’s that have to do with milk, you ask? Well, many of those birds live on farmland. And if farmers can’t stay in business, then that farmland becomes houses, or shopping centers, or other places where no respectable bird would live. Somerset County’s agricultural landscape and dairy farms make it the hotspot in Western Pennsylvania for barn owls.  The habitat and sustainable farming practiced at Pleasant View give it great potential for barn owls, American kestrels, and eastern meadowlarks—and all of these are listed as species of greatest conservation need in Pennsylvania. The rotational grazing system and organic crop production help the birds and the bees (and other pollinators!)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Since we're already milking cows, bottling the milk, and selling it directly to the public, and can't make enough to meet demand, the one big risk, ""do we have a market?"" is a moot point, thank goodness.  However, there are other inherent risks to any type of farming venture.</p>
<p>1.  <strong>Profitability</strong>:  We can talk all we want about sustainable farming practices but a sustainable farm must be a profitable farm.  I'm glad to report that we are profitable at our current pricing and with our current operating expenses.   But we do need to grow a little bigger to sustain the farm and the farmer with adequate cash flow.  </p>
<p>2.  <strong>Weather</strong>: Farmers are at the mercy of the weather.  At Pleasant View Dairy we grow most of our feed for the cows so bad crop years can impact our bottom line if we have to buy more feed.    </p>
<p>3. <strong> Herd Health:</strong> Cows can and do get sick and sometimes have to leave the herd.  Too many animals leaving the herd unexpectedly can definitely impact the bottom line.  We've farmed organically and relied heavily on rotational grazing for years and those practices generally lead to better overall herd health.  Also, we do not push our cows for production.  We feed them a well-balanced forage based diet when they're not on pasture, treat them well and let them do their own thing milk production wise.  We'd never over feed grain or use anything artificial to up milk production which is a major cause of negative cow health issues on modern dairy farms. </p>
<p>4. <strong> Regulatory Issues:</strong> Producing milk for sale directly to the public is a highly regulated process.  It needs to be to ensure public safety.  The current regulatory environment while favorable to small dairies being allowed to operate this way is still extremely strict and at times difficult to navigate.  We do everything in our power to meet and exceed regulatory standards, rules and laws.  We are inspected regularly and (thanks to years of experience) have passed everything with flying colors and hope to continue to do so.  We must, however, be recertified every year by the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture. </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute financially, we get that, but that doesn't mean you can't help!</p>
<p>It would be a huge help if you share our campaign on your social media outlets.</p>
<p>You can also share our campaign with your real-life social and civic groups and with places of business you frequent especially if you think they might be a good fit for what we're doing.</p>
<p>And of course, if you're in our area, come on out and say hello and try some milk! </p>

$150 Bottle Feed a Calf As calves are born on the farm this spring and summer we'll give you the chance to perform the age old farm chore of bottle feeding a newborn baby calf!  Open to any age.
The Big Guns, (or Guernseys):

Folks, we thought if we're going to ask you to help us buy cows, we need to offer some fabulous perks and more so,  give you the chance to participate in a very real way.  Here's what we've come up with.   Buckle your seatbelts and hold on, it's gonna be a wild ride!!
$250 Sponsor a Newborn Calf  What better way to show your support for Pleasant View Dairy than by sponsoring new life and future herd members!  Your sponsorship will include a sponsorship certificate, a calf information sheet including the calf's name, birthdate, pedigree, and health information, regular updates about your calf, regular visits with your sponsored calf, and most fun of all - a professionally done photograph of you/your family with your sponsored calf.  Price includes whole family.  (Great project for kids!)
$350 Name a Newborn Calf  So, we figure if they can sell the naming rights to stadiums, why can't we sell the naming rights to calves! And besides, calves are much cuter than stadiums and way cheaper to name! As calves are born this spring and summer you will have the opportunity to name that calf whatever you want (within reason people) and lay claim to the fact that as that calf grows into an adult that YOU named it!  
$500  Calf Sponsorship/Calf Naming Rights Combo  So what's better than sponsoring a calf?  How about being able to name the calf you sponsor!  Choose this combo perk and save $100 over buying separately.
$1500 Sponsor a Cow  This is the big one folks!  This is your chance - perhaps the only chance you will ever have in your lifetime -  to be part of the purchase of a cow.  I personally love this idea because over time as the community of Pleasantviewers has emerged, so many people have told me how much they love the cows.  This is your chance to have a very unique, very real, very tangible connection to one of God's most important gifts to humanity, the humble dairy cow. 
Your sponsorship will include a cow sponsorship certificate, a cow information sheet with her birthdate, pedigree (if known), registration number, health information, regular updates about your sponsored cow, regular visits with your cow and a professionally made photograph of you/your family with your sponsored cow.  I also figure if you pay for me to buy a cow you ought to get some milk from her! Although I have no way to  separate out the milk specifically from your sponsored cow, I can give you the milk she helps produce.  So, your sponsorship will include a year's supply of milk (1 gallon per week 52 weeks)  
$2500 The Whole Enchilada  (Triple Cheese, of course!) Like everything you see but can't decide on which level to contribute?  Problem solved... get the whole enchilada!  This level gets you all the perks listed including cow sponsorship with one neat little added feature.  If you choose this level we will reserve your sponsored cow's calf to be the calf that you sponsor and name.  Imagine the excitement as your sponsored cow's due date approaches, knowing that you will be sponsoring and naming the calf she gives birth to.  Talk about a fun and worthwhile family project!     
 
Community
Who'd have thought the simple act of putting whole, unadulterated, full-fat milk in a glass bottle would cause such a stir and give birth to such a wonderful new community?  I sure didn't.  I just wanted to milk cows again and sell the best milk I could make in glass bottles.  But as more and more people found us and came to love our milk, new friendships were formed and those friendships formed the foundation of a new community.  I never really thought about it, but before we started doing this, people in our area didn't even have the option to buy this kind of milk.  Full-fat, creamtop (yes it separates so shake it!) milk in glass bottles simply did not exist here before we started.   Now it does and it's really neat to think that people have gone out of their way and changed their buying habits to get our milk.  (Does that make me and the cows disrupters?!  We are indeed disrupting the usual super fast, super cheap, super processed, super junk food supply chain?!)  When folks find us they are genuinely super enthusiastic about our milk and that enthusiasm is quite contagious!  Community forming contagious, in fact!  
From the many people who tell us they couldn't drink milk before but can drink ours, to the folks who are nostalgic for the creamtop or the glass bottles or both, to the many young people who report to us that they had no idea that this was what real milk was supposed to be like,  to the folks who love the idea of getting away from plastic, it all adds up to the new community of Pleasantviewers. 
For me,  the community aspect was totally unexpected and a total blessing in my life.  Funny to think that our farm stand has become a gathering place for this community just like an old general store.  I love hearing people compare notes about how they use the milk and catch up with each other.  Coming out to the farm - on Saturday especially -  has become a social event for many Pleasantviewers!
So if you're already a Pleasantviewer, thanks a million for your support.  If you haven't tried our milk yet, I hope you will and I  hope you'll join us on our journey and become a part of this crazy community!

The Impact
[This section contributed by Wildlife Biologist and loyal Pleasant View customer, Tammy Colt.]
Impact? This project has impact like an asteroid! Food shortages during the COVID-19 crisis have reminded us about the importance of local food and given us a renewed appreciation of the American farmer. For many Pleasant View customers, picking up delicious, fresh milk in glass bottles, right at the farm, brings a sense of nostalgia. Local food used to be the norm, sad fact is it's a rarity these days!  And those Guernsey Girls’ A2A2 milk is super healthy, allowing some people who’ve had to give up milk to feel like a kid again. 
Pleasant View milk is healthy for the environment, too.  Instead of shipping from farm to processing plant to then be distributed by big trucks to grocery stores, where it’s finally purchased by the consumer, their milk is sold directly from the farm.  Less transportation = smaller carbon footprint (or hoofprint?)  And those returnable glass bottles aren’t just nostalgic—they replace that dreadful single-use plastic.  And because this milk is farm fresh and not homogenized, it can be made into yogurt, cottage cheese, butter, ricotta, queso . . . wait, I’m getting hungry . . .that’s a whole garbage can full of single-use plastic replaced! 
But wait there’s more! Did you know that North America has lost 50% of its grassland birds in the last half-century?  What’s that have to do with milk, you ask? Well, many of those birds live on farmland. And if farmers can’t stay in business, then that farmland becomes houses, or shopping centers, or other places where no respectable bird would live. Somerset County’s agricultural landscape and dairy farms make it the hotspot in Western Pennsylvania for barn owls.  The habitat and sustainable farming practiced at Pleasant View give it great potential for barn owls, American kestrels, and eastern meadowlarks—and all of these are listed as species of greatest conservation need in Pennsylvania. The rotational grazing system and organic crop production help the birds and the bees (and other pollinators!)

Risks & Challenges
Since we're already milking cows, bottling the milk, and selling it directly to the public, and can't make enough to meet demand, the one big risk, ""do we have a market?"" is a moot point, thank goodness.  However, there are other inherent risks to any type of farming venture.
1.  Profitability:  We can talk all we want about sustainable farming practices but a sustainable farm must be a profitable farm.  I'm glad to report that we are profitable at our current pricing and with our current operating expenses.   But we do need to grow a little bigger to sustain the farm and the farmer with adequate cash flow.  
2.  Weather: Farmers are at the mercy of the weather.  At Pleasant View Dairy we grow most of our feed for the cows so bad crop years can impact our bottom line if we have to buy more feed.    
3.  Herd Health: Cows can and do get sick and sometimes have to leave the herd.  Too many animals leaving the herd unexpectedly can definitely impact the bottom line.  We've farmed organically and relied heavily on rotational grazing for years and those practices generally lead to better overall herd health.  Also, we do not push our cows for production.  We feed them a well-balanced forage based diet when they're not on pasture, treat them well and let them do their own thing milk production wise.  We'd never over feed grain or use anything artificial to up milk production which is a major cause of negative cow health issues on modern dairy farms. 
4.  Regulatory Issues: Producing milk for sale directly to the public is a highly regulated process.  It needs to be to ensure public safety.  The current regulatory environment while favorable to small dairies being allowed to operate this way is still extremely strict and at times difficult to navigate.  We do everything in our power to meet and exceed regulatory standards, rules and laws.  We are inspected regularly and (thanks to years of experience) have passed everything with flying colors and hope to continue to do so.  We must, however, be recertified every year by the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture.

With 87 million Americans who are Pre-Diabetic and most not even knowing, it is crucial for people to reduce their intake of sugar and processed foods.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Project:</span> </strong><br/>In order to stop this epidemic from growing we have created a project to source worldwide, manufacture and distribute low glycemic, nutritionally dense foods and beverages unavailable to the typical shopper, even in today’s health food stores. The DiaSnacks™ kit will be the healthy alternative to dangerous sugar habits. Distribution will be accomplished via specially trained healthcare practitioners offering it in their practice, and friends or family members interested in helping their loved ones who are at risk of becoming a diabetic via the FUN (Friends Understanding Nutrition) Movement. Our mission with the FUN Movement is to touch 1M Pre-Diabetics and help the world prevent the epidemic of diabetes from destroying lives and people's finances.</p>
<p> <strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Reason for the Project:</span></strong></p>
<p>My name is Al Pirnia, I am a health executive who became a Type II Diabetic, not because I had terrible food habits, but because I did not have access to tasty foods and beverages that had low sugar content. I set out to do something about this by building a kit of low-glycemic, conveniently packaged foods and beverages that will help people learn how to never become a diabetic, especially if they were a pre-diabetic. This endeavor has taken me 2 years to accomplish, working with a team where we researched and experimented ways to develop and discover products from all over the world that can help people make better choices to support healthy blood sugar. These healthy alternatives needed to not only be tasty and portable, but provide key nutrients typically deficient with people who are diabetic or pre-diabetic. In our fast paced and automated society, finding low glycemic, nutritionally dense foods and beverages that are tasty is difficult for the average consumer.</p>
<p>The typical foods and beverages people eat, especially the processed and pre-packaged variety, are laden with sugar or simple carbs that spike blood sugar resulting in a rush of insulin that continues throughout the day. This constant spike in insulin over time, can result in people becoming insulin resistant whose side effect is elevated blood sugar, a symptom of Diabetes, which is now becoming a pandemic in America. My objective was accomplished with the launch of the DiaSnacks™ kit that provides 20 food and beverage items that are either specially formulated or sourced from far-away lands. I personally used the DiaSnacks™ food and beverages, and the information provided in the DiaSnacks™ manual to control my own diabetes without the need for any medication. DiaSnacks™ can become the alternative to high glycemic, sugar laden ""on the go"" food and beverages to help people make better food choices to support healthy blood sugar. DiaSnacks™ offers a delicious, portable, low glycemic snack, beverage, or meal for any lunch box, brief case, or purse. With our DiaSnacks™ launch, we are now kicking-off our FUN (Friends Understanding Nutrition) Movement with Indiegogo, whose mission is to touch 1 MILLION PRE-DIABETICS with DiaSnacks™.</p>
<p>The DiaSnacks™ kit will provide pre-diabetics with the “Greatest Gift of Health” which is to learn how to never become a Diabetic.  The value of the DiaSnacks™ kit is amazing as it includes:</p>

<li>20 food and beverage items</li>
<li>A DVD that explains how these foods and beverages are to be used</li>
<li>A Manual that enable anyone to find out the chances of being a pre-diabetic and reasons why people become a diabetic that no one is talking about</li>
<li>The WICO® Wellness Score that looks at 15 health conditions, some of which maybe underlying the reasons why people become a diabetic</li>
<li>A Consultation with a specially trained healthcare practitioner to interpret the WICO® Wellness Score results and make recommendations</li>

<p>A tasty, sweet beverage drink that is packed with all the key nutrients your body needs including amino acids, vitamins<br/>and minerals. These easy to carry packets come in 3 different flavors and can be mixed with cold or hot water.

<p><strong>3</strong>.<strong> Organic Mulberry Tea</strong></p>
<p>When drinking tea have organic Mulberry tea, which contains a unique compound known as 1-deoxynojirimycin (DNJ). It controls absorption of glucose and helps to decrease the amount of glucose in blood. As a result it prevents the increase of sugar levels in blood after a meal. In addition it helps support healthy blood pressure and cholesterol levels, promotes healthy digestive system, promotes healthy heart, supports healthy body weight and supports healthy liver function.</p>
<p><strong>4. Stevia Chocolate Dessert</strong></p>
<p>To satisfy your chocolate cravings without the blood sugar spike. It is the new taste standard for Stevia-Sweetened Chocolate and was 8 years in development to get the taste right. Just like the chocolate coinsures have insisted on. Everyone says it’s the best sugar-free chocolate ever tasted. What is amazing is that it doesn’t contain what most sugar-free chocolates contain—sugar alcohols in the form of maltitol or sorbitol. It’s sweetened with natural stevia. These easy to carry packets are great to have in your pocket or purse for that emergency treat or an after dinner dessert.</p>
<p> <strong>5. Camu Beverage</strong></p>

It contains powerful anti-oxidants, anti-inflammatory, astringent, extremely high in a potent form of Vitamin C (This fruit contains 50 times the vitamin C than oranges and is more absorbable by the body because it is plant based over synthetic vitamin C tablets), several amino acids and B vitamins giving it a variety of health benefits. This is an all-natural drink that is healthy and won't spike your blood sugar.</p>
<p><strong>6. The Perfect Meal</strong></p>
<p>Having easy access to a simple meal replacement that is whole food based packed with all the key nutrients needed for healthy blood sugar is crucial for today’s busy schedules.

Not only is The Perfect Meal portable and can be consumed without the need for any liquids by eating straight out of the packet, but it will support the body with all the needed key nutrients, while ensuring key meals are not skipped, crucial for normal body function, a balanced metabolism and healthy blood sugar.</p>
<p><strong>7. Natural Sweet Crystals</strong></p>
<p>Between meals these natural sweet crystal snack packets come in handy when something sweet is desired without the<br/>need for water or any other liquid to mix. It comes in different flavors and is packed with all the key nutrients your body needs, including the amino acids, vitamins and minerals. These easy to carry packets can be consumed directly from the packet and dissolved in your mouth, without the need to mix it with a liquid.</p>
<p><strong>8. Flavored Pistachio Nuts</strong></p>
<p>Nutrient dense pistachio nuts are loaded with beneficial carotenoids, phytosterols, and antioxidants. They are a good choice for a healthful snack that is of nutritive value. Studies have shown them to lower risk factors for disease that include: abdominal obesity, high blood pressure, high fasting glucose (blood sugar) levels and low high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels. The DiaSnacks pistachios have been roasted and sea salted to give a delicious but healthy salty taste. They are wrapped to be portable and always fresh when opened with taste and crunchiness. They are the perfect healthful snack that not only has great nutritive value, but is also very filling when hungry.</p>
<p><strong>9. Dried Mulberry Fruit</strong></p>
<p>Dried Mulberries are delicious and succulent, low in calories; but are a rich source of many health promoting plant derived<br/>compounds, minerals and vitamins that are essential for optimum health. However, finding organic delicious and<br/>appropriately sized dried Mulberries is a challenge as they can only be sourced from a select few countries. Scientific studies have shown that consumption of mulberries have potential health effects against cancer, aging and neurological diseases, inflammation, diabetes, and bacterial infections. They are a great combination to have with sea salted pistachios so as to off-set the saltiness with a sweet taste that is low glycemic so as to not spike blood sugar.</p>
<p><strong>10. Chickpeas</strong></p>
<p>The delicious nutlike taste and buttery texture of chickpeas provide a good source of zinc, folate &amp; protein, are low in calories and virtually fat-free. These dry roasted Chickpeas are a good source of cholesterol-lowering fiber and difficult to find even at your local health food store. This high fiber content prevents blood sugar levels from rising too rapidly after a meal and hence a healthy source of good <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrates"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Carbohydrates"">carbohydrates</a> for persons with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Insulin"">insulin</a> sensitivity or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Diabetes"">diabetes</a>. In addition to providing slow burning complex carbohydrates, Chickpeas can increase your energy by helping to replenish your iron stores. Iron is an integral component of hemoglobin, which transports oxygen from the lungs to all body cells and is also part of key enzyme systems for energy production and metabolism. They are also an excellent source of the trace mineral manganese, which is an essential co-factor in the energy production and in our antioxidant defense.</p>
<p> <strong>Note:</strong> When the Pistachios, Mulberries and Chickpeas are eaten in combination they are very filling and balance out each other’s salt and sweet tastes. With their portable packet size, they are very easy to consume when that afternoon hunger pang hits, wherever you are.</p>

It comes in different flavors and is packed with all the key nutrients your body needs, including the amino acids, vitamins and minerals. These easy to carry packets can be consumed directly from the packet and dissolved in your mouth, without the need to mix it with a liquid.
8. Flavored Pistachio Nuts
Nutrient dense pistachio nuts are loaded with beneficial carotenoids, phytosterols, and antioxidants. They are a good choice for a healthful snack that is of nutritive value. Studies have shown them to lower risk factors for disease that include: abdominal obesity, high blood pressure, high fasting glucose (blood sugar) levels and low high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels. The DiaSnacks pistachios have been roasted and sea salted to give a delicious but healthy salty taste. They are wrapped to be portable and always fresh when opened with taste and crunchiness. They are the perfect healthful snack that not only has great nutritive value, but is also very filling when hungry.
9. Dried Mulberry Fruit
Dried Mulberries are delicious and succulent, low in calories; but are a rich source of many health promoting plant derivedcompounds, minerals and vitamins that are essential for optimum health. However, finding organic delicious andappropriately sized dried Mulberries is a challenge as they can only be sourced from a select few countries. Scientific studies have shown that consumption of mulberries have potential health effects against cancer, aging and neurological diseases, inflammation, diabetes, and bacterial infections. They are a great combination to have with sea salted pistachios so as to off-set the saltiness with a sweet taste that is low glycemic so as to not spike blood sugar.
10. Chickpeas
The delicious nutlike taste and buttery texture of chickpeas provide a good source of zinc, folate & protein, are low in calories and virtually fat-free. These dry roasted Chickpeas are a good source of cholesterol-lowering fiber and difficult to find even at your local health food store. This high fiber content prevents blood sugar levels from rising too rapidly after a meal and hence a healthy source of good carbohydrates for persons with insulin sensitivity or diabetes. In addition to providing slow burning complex carbohydrates, Chickpeas can increase your energy by helping to replenish your iron stores. Iron is an integral component of hemoglobin, which transports oxygen from the lungs to all body cells and is also part of key enzyme systems for energy production and metabolism. They are also an excellent source of the trace mineral manganese, which is an essential co-factor in the energy production and in our antioxidant defense.
 Note: When the Pistachios, Mulberries and Chickpeas are eaten in combination they are very filling and balance out each other’s salt and sweet tastes. With their portable packet size, they are very easy to consume when that afternoon hunger pang hits, wherever you are.

MY JOURNEY, MY VENTURE</strong></p><p>We all have dreams. While some of us will risk everything to fulfill our dreams, others may bury them for family reasons or as a matter of personal sacrifice. </p><p>As a late baby boomer, I spent a better part of my adult years raising a family, wanting to give my wife and kids the best that I can afford. To do so, I pursued a predictable career path with iconic companies like <i><strong>Coca-Cola</strong></i>, <strong><i>Hershey’s</i></strong>, <i><strong>Kraft</strong></i> and <i><strong>Kellogg’s</strong></i>. Despite steadily climbing the corporate ladder and enjoying promotions to various senior management positions – including at one point leading a sizable international operation with 1,000+ employees – my desire to build a meaningful business of my own and create an enduring brand never diminished. In fact, it grew stronger as the years went by.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1574262101/aubkjsbryxtmoitumzcc.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>By 2014, at a time when many of my contemporaries were either reaching the pinnacle of their career or thinking about retiring early to enjoy life more, I chose to take one more shot at entrepreneurship. Learning from previous mistakes, my latest attempt would focus on an industry where I have built my career – Food &amp; Beverage. For this particular venture, I also persuaded two trusted friends from my Hershey’s and Coca-Cola days – Jeffrey and Vincent – to join me in forming Global Tree Functional Foods Limited (GTFF).</p><p> </p><div>
<p align=""center""><i><strong><u>Mission Statement </u></strong></i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i><strong>GTFF exists to provide healthy and yummy alternatives for people wanting to get the optimal natural energy and purest personal enjoyment out of every eating and snacking moment.</strong></i></p>

</div><p align=""center""> </p><p align=""center""><strong>II. THE BRAND </strong></p><p>Prior to establishing GTFF, I was living in San Francisco Bay Area and noticed that people of all ages were munching on a snack known as energy bars. My wife, too, from time to time would include them as a treat in our teenage daughter's lunchbox. Being unfamiliar with the product, and out of curiosity, I decided to try some but found the overall taste and mouthfeel to be bland and not very delectable. Surely, these bars could do much better...so I thought to myself.</p><p>After a closer examination, I found energy bars to be quite convenient and portable as: 1) a wholesome snack, 2) a mini meal, and 3) a meal replacement. Given Asia’s notorious ""overtime"" work culture, changing lifestyle and growing health awareness, I became convinced that such a versatile product could potentially find broad acceptance outside of California, on the other end of Pacific Ocean - particularly among young professionals, office staff and service industry personnel who must toil for long hours everyday with hardly any breaks.</p><p>In addition, I wanted to create products that were not only good for our body, but also positive for our environment and the community as well. Eventually, I began to formulate ideas for a line of ""<i><strong>triple threat</strong></i>"" snacks (i.e. <i><strong>better for you, better for the society and better for our planet</strong></i>) aimed at Asia, with Greater China region (Hong Kong/Taiwan/China) as the initial target. The result: Oomph!</p><div><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i>Oomph! is the plant-based, East-meets-West, fusion snack bar that provides distinctive mouthfeel, dense nutrients and wholesome goodness – anytime, anywhere –  for busy, active and wellness-minded people wanting to eat right, stay fit, feel free and live vigorously.</i></strong></p></div><p> </p><p align=""center""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1567757617/ucg1k5ivedo0uau8anzm.jpg"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><i><strong>As a brand, Oomph! stands for adventure.</strong></i></p><p>I firmly believe that we are all born with unlimited potential - regardless of physical limitations - and that the more we are able to express ourselves freely the happier we will be. To realize our innate talent and individual calling, it is imperative that we maintain an adventurous mindset in order to explore and discover our true passion. By doing so, our thoughts and energy can be channeled positively toward achieving a most satisfying outcome.</p><p><i><strong>On a more personal level, Oomph! is the culmination of a lifetime quest to build a meaningful business of my own and create an enduring brand. </strong></i></p><p>This quest started when I was hired right out of school as an entry-level sales rep by Quaker Oats to call on rural supermarkets in East Texas’ backwater towns. Since then, the pursuit has taken me half way around the world: from America’s ultra conservative Deep South to Asia’s super modern metropolises. Along the way, I survived two near fatal accidents: one in Sydney, when I was swept away by a giant wave while ocean swimming in Bondi Beach, and another in Manzhouli, a Sino-Russian border outpost in Siberia, when I was unwittingly exposed to hypothermia. At last, with Oomph! I have found my calling and could see myself jumping out of bed every morning to do something that really excites me. No more Monday blues.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1573715805/jkg8vsoplty1h0xw5qhs.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><div><p align=""center""><strong>III. THE PRODUCT</strong></p></div><p>In the beginning, Oomph! was created with much help from my wife Wendy, who is a longtime vegetarian. Through hit-and-miss trials at our home kitchen in San Francisco Bay Area, which in itself is a East-West cultural melting pot, Wendy and I focused on developing <strong><i>naturally delicious and intrinsically </i><i>nutritious snack bars that could also provide functional health benefits without any artificial fortification or enrichment.</i></strong> This desire prompted us to zero in on <i><strong>plant protein</strong></i> (good for muscle, hair, skin and general well-being) and <i><strong>dietary fiber</strong></i> (good for gut health and lowering blood pressure / total cholesterol levels) as the two must-haves in the first batch of Oomph! bars to be produced.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1568867596/hvh2txgsbroe2clvwxfm.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>To overcome the trade-off between <strong><i>healthiness, freshness and tastiness</i></strong>, I later consulted with Western-trained nutritionists and food scientists as well as enlisted an award-winning executive pastry chef who was formerly with Shangri-La, the leading Hong Kong-based Asian luxury hotel chain, to give guidance on palatableness. The input from health and culinary experts, along with my own extensive experimentation, combined to make Oomph! a truly East-meets-West fusion snack bar that offers what I regard as <strong><i>the holy trinity in eating and snacking: great taste, excellent nutrition and functional health benefits.</i></strong> </p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1574586951/kurtnlscymmgnvukb1ok.jpg"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>In accordance with our guiding principle, <i><strong>every Oomph! bar is minimally processed and made with 12 sustainable, gluten-free, non-GMO, single-ingredient whole foods </strong></i>for attaining the ideal mix in essential nutrients (i.e. protein, fiber, carbohydrates, fatty acids, vitamins and minerals).

Under such a circumstance, and unless we are able to identify another prominent market - such as the US, where Oomph! was first conceived - for expanding our fan base, it will be very difficult for the brand to achieve its full potential within the time frame that we have set and the resources that we have allocated. </p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1567761288/dtsuxlum4ub6ce7801xv.png"" src=""""/></p><p><img border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src=""""/></p><p>Aside from market considerations, the escalating anti-government protests since June in Hong Kong - our home base - have made it increasingly challenging for consumer-oriented businesses to thrive as retail outlets and shopping malls are forced to shut down frequently to avoid being caught in the crossfire.

MY JOURNEY, MY VENTUREWe all have dreams. While some of us will risk everything to fulfill our dreams, others may bury them for family reasons or as a matter of personal sacrifice. As a late baby boomer, I spent a better part of my adult years raising a family, wanting to give my wife and kids the best that I can afford. To do so, I pursued a predictable career path with iconic companies like Coca-Cola, Hershey’s, Kraft and Kellogg’s. Despite steadily climbing the corporate ladder and enjoying promotions to various senior management positions – including at one point leading a sizable international operation with 1,000+ employees – my desire to build a meaningful business of my own and create an enduring brand never diminished. In fact, it grew stronger as the years went by.  By 2014, at a time when many of my contemporaries were either reaching the pinnacle of their career or thinking about retiring early to enjoy life more, I chose to take one more shot at entrepreneurship. Learning from previous mistakes, my latest attempt would focus on an industry where I have built my career – Food & Beverage. For this particular venture, I also persuaded two trusted friends from my Hershey’s and Coca-Cola days – Jeffrey and Vincent – to join me in forming Global Tree Functional Foods Limited (GTFF). 
Mission Statement 
GTFF exists to provide healthy and yummy alternatives for people wanting to get the optimal natural energy and purest personal enjoyment out of every eating and snacking moment.
 

 II. THE BRAND Prior to establishing GTFF, I was living in San Francisco Bay Area and noticed that people of all ages were munching on a snack known as energy bars. My wife, too, from time to time would include them as a treat in our teenage daughter's lunchbox. Being unfamiliar with the product, and out of curiosity, I decided to try some but found the overall taste and mouthfeel to be bland and not very delectable. Surely, these bars could do much better...so I thought to myself.After a closer examination, I found energy bars to be quite convenient and portable as: 1) a wholesome snack, 2) a mini meal, and 3) a meal replacement. Given Asia’s notorious ""overtime"" work culture, changing lifestyle and growing health awareness, I became convinced that such a versatile product could potentially find broad acceptance outside of California, on the other end of Pacific Ocean - particularly among young professionals, office staff and service industry personnel who must toil for long hours everyday with hardly any breaks.In addition, I wanted to create products that were not only good for our body, but also positive for our environment and the community as well. Eventually, I began to formulate ideas for a line of ""triple threat"" snacks (i.e. better for you, better for the society and better for our planet) aimed at Asia, with Greater China region (Hong Kong/Taiwan/China) as the initial target. The result: Oomph!Oomph! is the plant-based, East-meets-West, fusion snack bar that provides distinctive mouthfeel, dense nutrients and wholesome goodness – anytime, anywhere –  for busy, active and wellness-minded people wanting to eat right, stay fit, feel free and live vigorously.  As a brand, Oomph! stands for adventure.I firmly believe that we are all born with unlimited potential - regardless of physical limitations - and that the more we are able to express ourselves freely the happier we will be. To realize our innate talent and individual calling, it is imperative that we maintain an adventurous mindset in order to explore and discover our true passion. By doing so, our thoughts and energy can be channeled positively toward achieving a most satisfying outcome.On a more personal level, Oomph! is the culmination of a lifetime quest to build a meaningful business of my own and create an enduring brand. This quest started when I was hired right out of school as an entry-level sales rep by Quaker Oats to call on rural supermarkets in East Texas’ backwater towns. Since then, the pursuit has taken me half way around the world: from America’s ultra conservative Deep South to Asia’s super modern metropolises. Along the way, I survived two near fatal accidents: one in Sydney, when I was swept away by a giant wave while ocean swimming in Bondi Beach, and another in Manzhouli, a Sino-Russian border outpost in Siberia, when I was unwittingly exposed to hypothermia. At last, with Oomph! I have found my calling and could see myself jumping out of bed every morning to do something that really excites me. No more Monday blues.  III. THE PRODUCTIn the beginning, Oomph! was created with much help from my wife Wendy, who is a longtime vegetarian. Through hit-and-miss trials at our home kitchen in San Francisco Bay Area, which in itself is a East-West cultural melting pot, Wendy and I focused on developing naturally delicious and intrinsically nutritious snack bars that could also provide functional health benefits without any artificial fortification or enrichment. This desire prompted us to zero in on plant protein (good for muscle, hair, skin and general well-being) and dietary fiber (good for gut health and lowering blood pressure / total cholesterol levels) as the two must-haves in the first batch of Oomph! bars to be produced. To overcome the trade-off between healthiness, freshness and tastiness, I later consulted with Western-trained nutritionists and food scientists as well as enlisted an award-winning executive pastry chef who was formerly with Shangri-La, the leading Hong Kong-based Asian luxury hotel chain, to give guidance on palatableness. The input from health and culinary experts, along with my own extensive experimentation, combined to make Oomph! a truly East-meets-West fusion snack bar that offers what I regard as the holy trinity in eating and snacking: great taste, excellent nutrition and functional health benefits.   In accordance with our guiding principle, every Oomph! bar is minimally processed and made with 12 sustainable, gluten-free, non-GMO, single-ingredient whole foods for attaining the ideal mix in essential nutrients (i.e. protein, fiber, carbohydrates, fatty acids, vitamins and minerals). This means in each bar you will find 3 types of tree nuts, 2 types of dried fruits and 1 type of edible seeds, plus gluten-free whole grains and natural spices.Our meticulously formulated Oomph! bars start with mountain grown chia seeds from Ecuador (for rich, all around nutrition) and wild blueberries from Canada (for most powerful antioxidants) as the base ingredients. They are then blended with different slow-roasted nuts (i.e. almond, walnut, cashew, pecan, and macadamia) and various sun-dried fruits (i.e. cherries and cranberries) to produce an incomparable mouthfeel that can best be described as crunchy, chewy and crispy all at the same time. Aside from taste and nutrition, Oomph! bars are naturally rich in plant-based iron and calcium, providing more than 50% and 40%, respectively, of an adult' daily requirement. No fortification or enrichment, just pure goodness derived from nature. Iron is known for boosting stamina and reducing fatigue, while calcium is known for improving bone and muscle health. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), iron and calcium are the most common nutrient deficiencies worldwide, especially for women. With Oomph! you can literally eat with your eyes, because what you see is what you will get. Exceptional care has been taken to ensure that each bar's journey from conception to consumption is free from overprocessing - so that the original form and nutrition quality of every ingredient is maximally retained.

We have also given away 5,000 bars for charitable donations, non-profit events sponsorship and samplings. Oomph! has repeatedly beaten top US brands in informal taste tests and received highly favorable feedback from customers and the trade alike.

  In 2018 Oomph! was chosen by Localiiz, a leading Hong Kong online lifestyle magazine targeted at expats and English-speaking professionals, as a Top Ten delicious and guilt-free snack.Oomph! bar is a total game-changer. Not only is it genuinely delicious (we’ve polished off several boxes in the office), the ingredients are painstakingly sourced, all-natural, and ridiculously good for you. – Localiiz, Hong Konghttps://www.localiiz.com/top-10-tastiest-healthy-snacks-guilt-free-treats-hong-kong/ Earlier in 2017 Oomph! was picked by Sassy Mama, a leading regional online magazine in Hong Kong, Singapore and Dubai for high spending, fun-loving mothers with young children, as a Top Ten healthy snack for every member of the family.Energy-dense? Guilt-free? Eco-friendly? Tick! When it comes to our favorite energy bar, it’s no surprise that Oomph! lands on the top of the list. – Sassy Mama, Hong Konghttps://www.sassymamahk.com/food-eat-healthy-snack-lunch-box-kids-family/ On Dec 14, 2018 GTFF, the brand owner of Oomph!, was named a Top 36 Startup in Jumpstarter, an annual global competition backed by Alibaba to showcase quality startups and promote entrepreneurship. As the only pure food company to be recognized with such an honor among a legion of FinTech, AI and mobile app startups, we could not have been more proud.https://2019.jumpstarter.hk/en/top-hk/36 V. SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY & SUSTAINABILITYThe WHO regards food and nutrition as a top priority and basic human right. Without adequate nourishment children, in particular, would be unable to reach their full development potential. As someone who used to go to bed at night feeling starved and undernourished as a neglected teenager following my mother's untimely death, nothing upsets me more than seeing helpless kids being stripped of their most inalienable rights for food and nourishment.Through Oomph! I have been fortunate enough to expand my previous involvement with charities and non-profit organization by donating products and sponsoring events aimed at alleviating hunger, reducing malnutrition and helping the needy. As Oomph! continues to gain acceptance, there should be more opportunities for the brand to do more social good and make a bigger humanitarian impact.  On the issue of sustainability, the United Nations has estimated that by 2050 our earth's population will have grown by as many as 2 billion people to reach a staggering total of 9.7 billion! The inevitable rise in human demand for natural resources to satisfy our expanding ecological footprint in coming decades, couple with accelerated urbanization, will most definitely exacerbate climate change. This worrisome phenomenon, if left uncontrolled, can adversely affect the world supply of food and water. Already, in recent years our environmental woes have worsen as greenhouse gas emissions and deforestation continue to rise unabated.Let's not deceive ourselves about climate change: Unless everyone does his/her part now to mitigate the undesirable effects of global warming, come 2050 our future generation's survival may be at serious risk due to severe declines in food and water availability.   Plant-based foods, as opposed to animal-based foods, not only are healthier, more eco-friendly and require considerably less water to produce, they hold the key to our future survival - sustainability. For this very reason, we are dedicated to using plant-based ingredients for making every Oomph! bar and doing our utmost to support SDG (Sustainable Development Goal) activities. VI. WHAT MAKES OOMPH! DIFFERENTOne might wonder, there are already zillions of snack bars in the market, why do we need another one? What is so different about Oomph! aside from being a plant-based, fusion snack bar with Eastern and Western influences?Uncommonly Delicious Taste Oomph! is a wholesome snack bar with adventurous mouthfeel - one that can best be described as crunchy, chewy and crispy all at the same time.

Some bars will add soy derivatives and whey protein for boosting their protein content, or use artificial sweeteners for cutting down calories. You will never find any scary-sounding chemicals or unfamiliar names listed in our bars. In Oomph! you can enjoy  our gluten-free, iron-rich bars with great peace of mind; yet, be tinged with anticipation as no two bars will ever look the same and every bite is deliciously different.  Oomph! is more than just a BFY (i.e. better for you) snack.

These ubiquitous products can be seen everywhere in the US these days, with retail sales reaching an estimated USD 8 billion in 2018.By contrast, with just USD 70 million in sales for 2018, or less than 1% of the total US demand, snack bars in Greater China are still seen as a niche product appealing mainly to English-educated health aficionados. The category itself, much to our chagrin, has also not grown as fast as we had hoped. Under such a circumstance, and unless we are able to identify another prominent market - such as the US, where Oomph! was first conceived - for expanding our fan base, it will be very difficult for the brand to achieve its full potential within the time frame that we have set and the resources that we have allocated.  Aside from market considerations, the escalating anti-government protests since June in Hong Kong - our home base - have made it increasingly challenging for consumer-oriented businesses to thrive as retail outlets and shopping malls are forced to shut down frequently to avoid being caught in the crossfire. This turmoil, however unexpected, is a harsh reality whose fallout we now must contend with going forward. Lastly, with many key ingredients needed to make Oomph! bars being imported from California (i.e. almond, walnut, pecan, cherries and flax seeds), greater supply chain improvements can also be attained by having the product made close to its US sourcing origin.  VIII. HOW YOU CAN HELPIn order for Oomph! bars to be available AND affordable in the US, it will be necessary to have them made domestically, rather than in Asia. To do so, we must raise additional funds to pay for production, packaging, shipping and marketing expenses in the US. In view of the above, it is our estimate that at least USD 30,000 will be required for the first batch of Oomph! bars to be delivered and marketed among our supporters and target customers across America.  Please note that since our company was founded in 2014 my partners, friends, relatives and I have bootstrapped (i.e. self-funded) for five straight years to bring our vision of Oomph! to reality. We have thus far invested well over USD 100,000  to start everything from scratch, including essential activities such as: 1) market research, 2) product development, 3) packaging, 4) production, 5) logistics, 6) sales, 7) marketing, 8) brand communication, 9) trademark registration, 10) web design, 11) e-commerce, and 12) personnel & administration.Needless to say, all the stakeholders and myself have a lot of skin in the game right now. We have undertaken substantial financial risks to turn Oomph! from just a drawing on the napkin paper into an exciting reality. For this particular production run in the US, however, we are asking for your support - so that our Oomph! bars can be shipped to you for trial and feedback once the campaign ends. Just as important, your timely endorsement will help Oomph! to keep moving forward and our dream to stay alive.   IX. WHAT’S NEXTShould we be able to raise sufficient funds from the campaign to produce Oomph! bars in the US, our next step would be to sell them online at a marketplace like Amazon, Jet or iHerb, plus subscription snack services such as Love With Food and NatureBox. Once we are able to generate favorable word-of-mouth and strong endorsement from online customers in the US, we will approach specialty food stores (Whole Foods Market, Trader Joe’s, Sprouts, etc.) for listing in their outlets. With Oomph! being available online and offline, there is no telling how far the brand can go to realize its true potential.   X. ABOUT MYSELFPlease go to the link below for more details about my background.https://www.linkedin.com/in/edward-l-wang-71a07...  XI. BRAND MANIFESTOOomph! believes that life is an adventure; that we should always walk our talk; and that we are what we eat. By embracing different experiences, upholding a principled existence, and pursuing a lifestyle of health and sustainability, we can all live each day to its fullest – with a higher purpose and grater happiness. Thanks for your exceptional patience in going through our highly detailed Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign in its entirety - all eleven parts of it!Hope you have enjoyed the introductory video written/directed/edited by my 16-year-old daughter, Ashlynn, and learning about the full story behind the creation of Oomph! Hope, too, that my story has resonated with you in a positive way. If so, please back our campaign and share it with someone who you feel might also want to endorse our fundraising effort. Thanks again and may all your dreams come true.",50.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Frosty Fox is looking to start the 2016 summer season with a bang!  I'm asking for a small contribution to begin the season and to start saving for a fancy ice cream bike  (for all you 'Dickie Dee' fans) or possibly an ice cream truck!</p>
<p> From making fresh ice cream with as many local products as possible, to all of the cookies...I mean ALL of the cookies from scratch, I promise to always produce an honest product.</p> </div> <div> <h3>With your help!</h3>
<div>Frosty Fox can be more accessible this summer, which means being at more then one market (maybe two!) and at some local festivals .</div>
<div>Eventually, (which means next summer 2017) Frosty Fox Ice Cream will be mobile, be it with an environmentally sound bike or not so much with a saucy ice cream truck.</div> </div> <div> <h3>What Frosty Fox will Deliver:</h3> <p>Do you love to eat ice cream?

<p><strong>À La Dérive Brasserie Artisanale, c’est quoi ?</strong></p>
<p>En premier lieu, le projet À La Dérive est motivé par une passion commune, la création de bières artisanales de qualité. De plus, nous souhaitons utiliser des ingrédients de la région pour la confection de nos bières afin de réduire notre empreinte écologique, de favoriser l’économie circulaire et de créer des produits reflétant la grande diversité de la flore québécoise. Nous avons pour objectif de collaborer avec les agriculteurs et les herboristes de la région afin de développer des bières aux goûts uniques inspirés par notre végétation nordique.</p>
<p>Nous avons actuellement la chance de travailler sur le menu de la brasserie avec Véronique Bujold, une chef qui a fait ses preuves dans la région auprès du restaurant Les vilains garçons et le Restaurant Antonyme (tous deux reconnus pour leur menu créatif et savoureux). Il s’agira d’un menu de type « Pub revisité » avec des recettes réalisées à partir d’ingrédients de la région et incluant nos bières. Nous avons pour objectif de créer des accords mets et bières ainsi que des soirées « chefs invité.e.s » afin de faire rayonner le savoir-faire culinaire de la province.</p>
<p>En plus d’être un levier économique positif dans le secteur de Pointe-Gatineau, À La Dérive s’inscrit dans une logique de développement durable. Le plan est de réduire au maximum l’empreinte écologique de la brasserie en compostant l’entièreté des résidus organiques du restaurant, en offrant les drêches du brassage aux agriculteurs de la région ainsi qu’en utilisant des ingrédients locaux pour la création de nos bières.  De plus, l’ensemble des entrepreneurs souhaitent s’investir socialement dans le quartier en créant un lieu de rencontre propice à l’échange et aux rassemblements d’amateurs de bières. Nous avons l’intention d’organiser divers événements culturels : expositions d’art, soirées poésie et même un marché fermier durant la période estivale !</p>

<p>Martin est le digne et fier représentant d’une lignée de riverains établis sur la rue Jacques-Cartier dans le secteur de Pointe-Gatineau. Pompier de formation, il a développé des aptitudes pour l’entraide, l’implication sociale et la politique municipale. Martin est un grand passionné de bières qui a parcouru maintes contrées à la recherche des plus fines bulles !</p>
<p>Benoît cumule plus de 14 ans d’expérience dans le monde de la restauration, il a une formation de cuisinier et il a ouvert un restaurant à l’âge de 21 ans ! Avec l’aide de la talentueuse chef Véronique Bujold, Benoit développe présentement un menu copieux et raffiné, élaboré à partir d’ingrédients québécois et locaux. L’amour qu’il met dans la création de chacun de ces petits plats saura ravir le plus fin des palets.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am a faculty at Christ (Deemed to be University), Bengaluru, India.  In my quest to find an eco-friendly alternative to the plastic and paper straws, I developed drinking straws from coconut leaflets.  The patent application is published in the patent journal of India.</p>
<p>The unique properties of coconut palm leaflets make it a perfect material to roll them into straws.  It doesn't get soggy and retains its shape for hours together.  It easily has a shelf life of three months.</p>
<p>Nearly 300-400 straws can be made from a single compound leaf of coconut.  Its made of the fallen leaf.  The straws which are made with its mid rib as part of the leaf can be used for tetra pak juices as it can puncture the seal.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
I am a faculty at Christ (Deemed to be University), Bengaluru, India.  In my quest to find an eco-friendly alternative to the plastic and paper straws, I developed drinking straws from coconut leaflets.  The patent application is published in the patent journal of India.
The unique properties of coconut palm leaflets make it a perfect material to roll them into straws.  It doesn't get soggy and retains its shape for hours together.  It easily has a shelf life of three months.
Nearly 300-400 straws can be made from a single compound leaf of coconut.  Its made of the fallen leaf.  The straws which are made with its mid rib as part of the leaf can be used for tetra pak juices as it can puncture the seal.
I need help to manufacture manually operated simple devices to roll  the leaflet into straws, involve rural communities to source, clean, sterilize and roll out straws to cater to the humongous market for drinking straws.
Your contributions can help me accelerate the manufacture of devices, to roll the straws, and work out the business model including  sourcing raw material, production, distribution, marketing and sales and organize awareness campaigns.
Remember, keep it concise, yet personal. Ask yourself: if someone stopped reading here would they be ready to make a contribution?

<p>We’ve always felt chopsticks to be one of the most unique and innovative utensils in the history of humanity - simple, multi-use, effective. However, why has this innovation stalled? Why have we become content with what we have instead of looking for newer, better alternatives? How is it that disposable and plastic options have become standard, burdening the planet with excess waste? This frustrating reality sparked our extremely personal mission to develop something fresh and revolutionary.</p>

<p>In designing the all-in-one carrying case for our TWINZ chopsticks, straw &amp; rest, we decided to develop a specially crafted pouch made of high quality canvas. With the pouch, it allows the chopsticks to breathe, with continued exposure to open, fresh air. This keeps both the pouch and the chopsticks themselves free from the risk of bacteria growth.</p>

<p>While single-use chopsticks have become our focus, it is important to remember other products which have a significant impact upon the natural world, namely disposable straws.</p>
<p>Plastic straws remain one of the largest sources of pollution in our oceans, contaminating once pristine natural spaces. For this reason, many cities around the globe have begun to ban plastic straws outright, hoping to minimize their negative effect on the ecosystem. Because of this, we’ve included a specially designed reusable straw with every set of TWINZ chopsticks, helping you to do your part to save our planet from rampant waste.</p>

<div> </div></section></div>","About



 
There are countless articles available online espousing the hidden dangers of disposable chopsticks. However, we decided to elucidate the truth for ourselves by doing some important tests.


We’ve always felt chopsticks to be one of the most unique and innovative utensils in the history of humanity - simple, multi-use, effective. However, why has this innovation stalled? Why have we become content with what we have instead of looking for newer, better alternatives? How is it that disposable and plastic options have become standard, burdening the planet with excess waste? This frustrating reality sparked our extremely personal mission to develop something fresh and revolutionary.




Introducing the latest in chopstick technology, TWINZ represents the cutting edge in sleek modern design. With the goal of reducing the impact of disposable chopsticks on the environment and a whole-hearted dedication to ushering in a greener future, our ultimate mission is to help the planet without sacrificing aesthetic value.
With TWINZ, we hope to usher in the next era of chopsticks - reusable, resilient, and healthy utensils for everyday use

1. BACTERIA RESISTANT - Titanium, thanks to its anti-bacterial characteristics, inhibits the growth of germs and other harmful pathogens. Because its non-porous and non-stick nature, nothing seeps inside, both keeping the integrity in tact and making it extremely easy to clean.
2. RECYCLABLE - TWINZ chopsticks are 100% recyclable. The recycled titanium can be turned into titanium feedstock and become easily reused for other useful products.
3. STRONG & LIGHT-WEIGHT - Titanium is among the strongest and most durable metals on the planet: it retains the inherent ability to resist rust and corrosion. On top of this, titanium is extremely lightweight, making it the perfect option for an everyday carry.
4. SUSTAINABLE - As soon as you stop using the disposable alternatives and begin to carry your own pair of reusable chopsticks, you have begun to save the trees. Each meal enjoyed with TWINZ chopsticks is another step closer to a greener world.

Perfect for EDC & home use



The sandblasted, non-slip tips make picking things up extremely easy
 

The standard, natural linen pouch, both breathable and easy to clean, is included with every pair of TWINZ Titanium Chopsticks (as well as the straw)


In designing the all-in-one carrying case for our TWINZ chopsticks, straw & rest, we decided to develop a specially crafted pouch made of high quality canvas. With the pouch, it allows the chopsticks to breathe, with continued exposure to open, fresh air. This keeps both the pouch and the chopsticks themselves free from the risk of bacteria growth.

Along with the pouch, we’ve included a compact chopstick holder. Perfect for propping up your pair of TWINZ during eating, this stand will keep your chopsticks out of contact with potentially contaminated surfaces. And because it is made of solid titanium, it's anti-microbial surface topology disallows germs from finding a foothold. 

 


 
While single-use chopsticks have become our focus, it is important to remember other products which have a significant impact upon the natural world, namely disposable straws.
Plastic straws remain one of the largest sources of pollution in our oceans, contaminating once pristine natural spaces. For this reason, many cities around the globe have begun to ban plastic straws outright, hoping to minimize their negative effect on the ecosystem. Because of this, we’ve included a specially designed reusable straw with every set of TWINZ chopsticks, helping you to do your part to save our planet from rampant waste.

 
The standard, natural-linen pouch is included with each TWINZ Titanium Straw.

Cool idea, but will it work? We’re a skeptical crew here at GIR, so we did a lot of testing to make sure we’ve got the goods. Our technology is patent pending, and there’s a lot more to come. But we thought it’d be fun to share some behind-the-scenes peeks at our process. To validate and refine our approach in the real-world, we designed test rigs with the help of none other than uber nerd Scott Heimendinger, THE Seattle Food Geek.<br/><p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1472247268/af5bbbd24663a4b88bbb480ae5c5f151_original_qyphm7.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>You’ve probably heard Scott’s name before, perhaps from his wildly successful Kickstarter campaign for the Sansaire, an amazing and affordable immersion circulator for cooking sous vide at home. Before co-founding Sansaire, Scott was the Director of Applied Research at Modernist Cuisine. He also laser-carves pumpkins in his free time.</p>
<p>Scott is a longtime friend of the GIR team, and a few months ago we chatted with him about the bean freshness sensing capability we were starting to build. When Scott heard about what we were planning, it tripped the geek-o-meter. He was both interested and gracious enough that he offered to help us research and prototype our sensing platform.</p>
<p>You might have guessed this already, but it turns out that Scott is a boss. He designed several sensing rigs so that we could look at volatile compound concentrations over time and the impact of things like temperature and bean grinding itself. This was a great proof of concept and helped narrow down our choice of which particular sensors would perform the best. Scott made a prototype of the sensing platform, and now we're running a number of other longer-term tests and integrating the sensors into the design of the Voltaire grinder and Airvault storage container.</p>
<p>Scott is going to back to his 30W CO2 laser to etch some more vegetables, but we were so lucky to have him in an advisory role. We're grateful for the amazing kickstart he gave us (pun intended) and we're ready to build the real deal.</p>

</div></div>","Voltaire is the world’s first high-performance portable burr grinder. An IoT-connected (Internet of Things) sensing platform and smartphone app allow users to measure bean freshness and receive replenishment alerts or auto-replenish when it’s time for fresh beans. Voltaire’s high-performance LiFePO4 batteries will last through over 3lbs of beans and hold a charge for up to three weeks. This is seriously smart coffee.If you’re not into the whole internet-of-things movement, but still want an amazing portable grinder, you can opt out of the sensing platform and simply pledge for the standalone model. We won't hold it against you - even without a ""brain,"" Voltaire is brilliant.Coffee has a lifespan. Green beans can last months before decline. Roasting them creates yumminess in the form of sugars, amino acids, and volatile compounds and gases that, ultimately, are also a key factor in the staling process. (More on that later.) After it’s roasted, a bean’s lifespan can be measured in mere days. The yumminess starts to fade, and rancid flavors creep in. Odds are, the best cup of coffee you ever had came from super fresh beans.There are a variety of factors that contribute to staling. We’re going to get a little nerdy here, so bear with us. Carbon dioxide diffusion, lipid oxidation, and aroma loss in the form of escaping volatile compounds are primary suspects. These reactions occur over time and are accelerated by heat, moisture, surface area, and oxygen exposure. It is a complex and fascinating process. Since there are a variety of environmental factors that come into play, it NEVER HAPPENS in the exactly same way. And it’s invisible.With the naked eye, it's impossible to look at a bean and tell just how fresh it is. But that's why we're here.Enter Voltaire.We’ve developed a sensing platform that measures what we can’t see: volatile compound release, gas concentration, temperature, humidity, bean mass, and volume. The sensor array communicates with a machine learning algorithm that can also consider inputs like roast date, purchase date, bean varietal, roast style, and other known factors. We can tell when your beans are really really fresh, when they start to degrade, and when they’re in the red zone of mediocrity. Over time, with more users and more data, we’ll continually refine our algorithm as it learns about different types of beans and roasts. Your grinder will be smart, and get smarter. And you’ll never have to drink stale coffee again.




The whole platform is wifi- and app-connected. All of the sensing data is available so that you can drill down on what’s happening inside your beans and in the surrounding environment. Voltaire also monitors mechanical data each time you grind - fineness, grind time, mass, and volume throughput. The app can even monitor total bean storage across both the Voltaire Grinder and Airvault Smart Container (see below!). When your beans get too stale or simply run low, it can remind you to buy more beans, or reorder automatically from your favorite roasters. We’ll be partnering with roasters, subscription services, and platforms like Amazon DRS to make the process totally seamless and fun.





So how do you avoid drinking bad coffee? You (now) know your beans are fresh. The next major step is to grind beans when you’re ready to brew, and not long before. Ground coffee has a lifespan that can be measured in minutes, which is why having a grinder is key. And THIS grinder gets it right.




Voltaire has components and features you’d expect from a barista’s dream setup. It’s what they’d bring home from the coffee shop - and you can even take it on the road.





We built this grinder from the inside-out, starting with conical ceramic burrs you'd normally find in a much larger grinder. We selected one of the best ceramics manufacturers in the world to make them for us. They generate an extremely reliable end product, and can be adjusted for French press, Turkish, and everything in between - including espresso, which demands highly consistent particle size.



Why conical? Conical burrs are an efficient grinding surface that can run at a relatively low RPM. That means less noise, and less heat buildup during the grinding process.
Why ceramic? Ceramic is harder and more long-lasting than stainless steel, and won’t need to be sharpened or replaced over time. It’s also very insulating, which means less heat retention. Heat starts to excite all of the volatile compounds in your beans, and you want those to end up in your cup as part of the brewing process, not to lose them beforehand.
We designed a stepless adjustment collar so that you can fine-tune your grind with expert precision. Most grinders allow you to choose from a handful of pre-set adjustments, which is easier to engineer but makes for an inferior end product. We're doing it the hard way, but it's worth the effort.


The beans drop directly from the hopper to the catch cup, which minimizes heat buildup and protects delicate flavor profiles. The more common alternative, a diagonal chute, overheats the beans and allows stale residue to build up.


A digital LED timer allows you start grinding and add - or subtract - time whenever you want. Once you've found the perfect grind time for your favorite brew, you can store that setting and activate it with a single touch.


A ring of bright LED lights above the catch cup illuminates the grinds as they descend from the burrs. It’s a beautiful sight, and also makes it easier to see how much you’ve ground.



The anti-static catch cup keeps grinds from jumping around or clinging. It can hold about 0.5lb (.22kg) ground beans, which is a little over 1.5 cups (350ml).








The lid locks in place for easy transport. An o-ring seal around bean hopper also limits oxygen and UV exposure to help slow the staling process (though the best hope for long-term bean storage is vacuum seal and toss them in a dark, cool place like a pantry cabinet or your freezer.) Like the catch cup, the hopper can store 0.5lb (.22kg) ground beans, which is a little over 1.5 cups (350ml).



The bean hopper can be removed for easy cleaning, and the components that come into direct contact with beans are dishwasher safe so that you can scrub away rancid oils or stale aromas.





Compatible with 100-120V and 220-240V power sources - when we say that the grinder can go anywhere, we mean it.





The stuff above makes for a really amazing feature list. We almost could have stopped right there - but we didn't.We've put all of these features into a grinder you can hold with one hand, and that means you can take it anywhere. Voltaire’s high-performance LiFePO4 batteries hold power for weeks between charging.Grind in the middle of your countertop, not in a corner by the outlet. Make fresh coffee on your backyard picnic table. Or take it even farther - you don't have to drink instant coffee on your next adventure. You can bring this grinder on a camping trip, to the beach, to the ski slopes, tailgating, or to next weekend's bike race.





Sensing the freshness of your coffee beans could be seen as a gimmick. Cool idea, but will it work? We’re a skeptical crew here at GIR, so we did a lot of testing to make sure we’ve got the goods. Our technology is patent pending, and there’s a lot more to come. But we thought it’d be fun to share some behind-the-scenes peeks at our process. To validate and refine our approach in the real-world, we designed test rigs with the help of none other than uber nerd Scott Heimendinger, THE Seattle Food Geek.



You’ve probably heard Scott’s name before, perhaps from his wildly successful Kickstarter campaign for the Sansaire, an amazing and affordable immersion circulator for cooking sous vide at home. Before co-founding Sansaire, Scott was the Director of Applied Research at Modernist Cuisine. He also laser-carves pumpkins in his free time.
Scott is a longtime friend of the GIR team, and a few months ago we chatted with him about the bean freshness sensing capability we were starting to build. When Scott heard about what we were planning, it tripped the geek-o-meter. He was both interested and gracious enough that he offered to help us research and prototype our sensing platform.
You might have guessed this already, but it turns out that Scott is a boss. He designed several sensing rigs so that we could look at volatile compound concentrations over time and the impact of things like temperature and bean grinding itself. This was a great proof of concept and helped narrow down our choice of which particular sensors would perform the best. Scott made a prototype of the sensing platform, and now we're running a number of other longer-term tests and integrating the sensors into the design of the Voltaire grinder and Airvault storage container.
Scott is going to back to his 30W CO2 laser to etch some more vegetables, but we were so lucky to have him in an advisory role. We're grateful for the amazing kickstart he gave us (pun intended) and we're ready to build the real deal.




We're able to deliver such a clever sensing base thanks to the countless contributions of makers and hackers who have driven down the barriers to entry for IoT devices. We want to continue that spirit of tinkering, for those of you inclined, by making the Voltaire Sensing Platform’s firmware largely open source. Want to create your own alerts, convert temperature readings to Kelvin, or use the sensing base for some other purpose entirely? Go for it.
And if apps are your thing, you can take advantage of the Voltaire API and SDK to develop your own applications that interact with our proprietary sensing technology.

This is not about making snobby coffee. It’s about helping everybody make better coffee with fewer unknowns in the equation. You can use freshly ground beans in your office drip setup (and be an office hero!), or that fancy espresso machine you splurged on. Either way, starting with fresh beans and a great grinder is pretty much all you need to start down the path toward maximum deliciousness. And that’s what Voltaire is all about.",56.0,0,"1 Campaign
