This is a reasonable response to the marginalization and systemic oppression of our community! I honor and respect the right of other LGBTQIA+ folks to not use that term for themselves, and I expect queer and non-LGBTQIA+ folks to respect them as well by not using the term for them. </i></p><p> </p><h2>Everyone Under the Umbrella Is Welcome at Under the Umbrella</h2><p>Under the Umbrella is a safe space to experience and create queer stories and queer community.

I identify primarily as queer, but specifically as pansexual and nonbinary/genderqueer. Those are words I didn’t know existed 10 years ago. Growing up religious in Provo, Utah, I didn’t have the language for or access to identities beyond heteronormativity. It wasn’t until much later in life that I realized that gender and sexuality weren’t the binary structures that I had been taught they were. What followed was more years of learning and critical thinking about my own identities, and reading every story I could find about queer people and queer identities.</p><div>

<div><strong>Finding stories that featured people like me—and people unlike me but also queer—was transformative. It made me feel powerful and seen. But it shouldn’t have taken so long to find that.</strong></div>
</div><p> </p><p>While I’m proud of my journey, I don’t want anyone else to have to wait to find a space to experience and create queer stories and queer community. </p><p>I have spent the last 14 years of my professional life as an editor focused on making language as accessible and inclusive as possible. Last year, I started an Instagram account dedicated to the queer books I was reading. I found an incredible community of queer book lovers and a world of queer stories I didn’t know existed, because traditional media didn’t prioritize those stories. This year I decided to expand that by providing space for queer stories to thrive. </p><p>Here’s how else I’ve immersed myself in the book industry:</p><ul>
<li>Completed an intensive course on the realities of bookselling and being a bookstore owner</li>
<li>Joined the American Booksellers Association and the Mountain and Plains Independent Booksellers Association, attended industry events, and networked with industry professionals across the country</li>
<li>Joined the Utah LGBTQ+ Chamber of Commerce, National LGBTQ Chamber of Commerce, and the Salt Lake Chamber of Commerce</li>
</ul><h2> </h2><h2>Making Under the Umbrella a Reality: Timeline and Budget</h2><p>So, turns out bookstores are expensive. With my personal investment and business plan, I’ll be able to cover a lot of costs for fixtures and furniture, rent, licensing and insurance, marketing, etc. I have received a $5,000 0% interest loan through Kiva for the bookstore-specific point of sale system that we will need to get the inventory up and running. In addition, I am investing $70,000 of my personal savings into the bookstore, and 50% of the salary from my current full-time job is being added to that fund biweekly. I anticipate paying myself a $15/hour wage at the store for the time it takes to become profitable. </p><p>But I still need help to purchase the opening inventory. Opening an account with wholesalers and publishers requires pre-payment for the first order, and ordering enough books to stock a bookstore costs a lot. The numbers below are an estimate based on a 1,500 square foot space.</p><ul>
<li>
<strong>Books and non-book merchandise</strong> (queer candles, mugs, pins, bookmarks and other book accessories): 1,300 selling square feet @ $70 per square foot (~7 titles per square foot) = $91,000. All of the money raised from this campaign will go toward building this inventory. If we raise $15,000 that's what our opening inventory will be! If we raise $100,000 that's what our opening inventory will be.</li>
<li>
<strong>Indiegogo fees:</strong> Indiegogo gets part of the amount we raise, 5% of funds raised <i>and</i> 2.9% + 30 cents per contribution. In order to actually get $50,000 for our inventory, we need to raise about $55,000. </li>
<li>
<strong>Cost of perks + shipping:</strong> We’ll do our best to keep these funds as low as possible, but some funds will inevitably go toward fulfillment of perks. If you’re local, consider opting for local pickup to help us save on shipping costs! (The cost of shipping is included in the perk cost.) </li>
</ul><p> </p><p>Perks will ship ~30 days after the campaign ends. We hope to open shop in June, in time to celebrate Pride with y’all. </p><h2>Risks and Challenges</h2><p>The margins on bookstores are very slim. If I try to compete with sellers like Barnes and Noble or Amazon on price, the bookstore simply won’t make any money and will have to close. As it is, I estimate it will take three years for the store to break even and start making any sort of profit. </p><p>Many bookstores have had to close over the last year because they were not equipped to handle online ordering when COVID forced stores to pause in-store shopping. I won’t be able to compete with Amazon on shipping price or speed, either, but I am building this business with a focus on online capabilities to ensure we can survive if in-store shopping has to pause again.</p><p>I’m in this for the long haul. Opening this store is my dream, and I deeply believe that our community would benefit from this space. I’m not doing this to make a lot of money, <strong>I’m doing this because I believe we deserve a space like this in our community, which means any profit the store makes will be reinvested into expanding the store, employee benefits, and community-building programs.</strong></p><h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2><p>If you can’t contribute financially, that’s ok!

<p>Some of you know us as Mary Puppins, some know us as Lisa and Reed. Many of you have seen our vans around the town but maybe some of you don't know what Planet Puppins is!</p>
<p>We established the Puppins Empire back in 2017 with dog walking, doggy day care and home boarding. (Some of you have been here from the very beginning!). In April 2018 we had to move to bigger premises but now the time has come to expand once again in order to really make an impact! <br/><br/>Our vision is to move into a building in the heart of Kilmarnock- you <u><strong>cannot </strong></u>and <u><strong>will not</strong></u> miss this place. This will be a cutting- edge facility,  incorporating everything your dog will need from puppyhood to senior years. Daycare, training classes, dog grooming, pet health care and so much more. </p>
<p>Our onsite dog friendly coffee shop will be open to the general public to pop in for a coffee, cake and a catch up.</p>
<p>We need your help though.  Your generosity will allow us to purchase the building and our goal is <u><strong>£90,000</strong></u> within <u><strong>49 days</strong></u>. By doing this, you will not only see the result of your donation but you, your pet and the wider community will be able to personally benefit from that. </p>
<p>The Puppins vision can only be achieved with <u><strong>your</strong></u> help. Many of you have been supporting us from the start and many more have become Pack Members recently. We appreciate that the last year has been incredibly tough both personally and financially for everyone but we thank you all for your continued support.</p>

We established the Puppins Empire back in 2017 with dog walking, doggy day care and home boarding. (Some of you have been here from the very beginning!). In April 2018 we had to move to bigger premises but now the time has come to expand once again in order to really make an impact! Our vision is to move into a building in the heart of Kilmarnock- you cannot and will not miss this place. This will be a cutting- edge facility,  incorporating everything your dog will need from puppyhood to senior years. Daycare, training classes, dog grooming, pet health care and so much more. 
Our onsite dog friendly coffee shop will be open to the general public to pop in for a coffee, cake and a catch up.
We need your help though.  Your generosity will allow us to purchase the building and our goal is £90,000 within 49 days. By doing this, you will not only see the result of your donation but you, your pet and the wider community will be able to personally benefit from that. 
The Puppins vision can only be achieved with your help. Many of you have been supporting us from the start and many more have become Pack Members recently. We appreciate that the last year has been incredibly tough both personally and financially for everyone but we thank you all for your continued support.
Every single penny counts. Together, we can do this. Are you ready? Let's go!!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p> ATIPICO se fundó en 2017, en Barcelona. Es la creación de mi hermosa familia trabajando unida y es la prueba de que todo es posible cuando tienes amor y sueños en tu corazón.</p>
<p>Siempre quise construir un espacio dedicado a crear una comunidad fuerte, a través de la comida, el arte y la creatividad. Pero no estaba seguro de cómo y dónde. Un día, justo antes del nuevo año, encontré ATIPICO, el espacio perfecto, estuvo vacío durante 15 años y tenía mucho potencial.</p>
<p>Mi hermano Theo y yo empezamos y con mucho trabajo, la ayuda de muchos amigos y el apoyo de nuestra madre Michele, con quien nada hubiera sido posible transformamos el espacio en un Rooftop Bar &amp; Restaurant que acogió innumerables eventos culturales. actividades y artistas, tanto locales como internacionales. Se convirtió en un lugar mágico donde se unieron diferentes culturas, todos aprendieron unos de otros y se conectaron maravillosamente. Todos se sentían como en casa y lo habíamos logrado ...</p>
<p>Estuvimos abiertos durante 2 años, pero desafortunadamente en junio de 2019, tuvimos que cerrar, necesitábamos hacer una renovación seria, para cumplir con las nuevas regulaciones. Tuvimos que destruir todas las instalaciones existentes y empezar de nuevo. No hace falta decir que fue un momento muy triste. Luego llegó 2020 y la pandemia no facilitó las cosas, el mundo se cerró y la cultura en todas partes se extinguió. Nos enfrentamos a una verdadera crisis cultural y social. Los espacios necesarios para que las personas se mantengan conectadas están desapareciendo uno a uno. Entonces, mientras todos estamos haciendo nuestro mejor esfuerzo ahora para combatir este virus desagradable, es muy importante proteger nuestros espacios locales e independientes. Los lugares que hacen vibrante y llena de sorpresas una ciudad.</p>

<p>No me he rendido, sé lo mucho que importa este lugar. Así que con mi socio German hemos estado trabajando sin descanso, en silencio en las sombras y estamos orgullosos de anunciar que después de muchos pacientes, papeleo y planificación, RECUPERAMOS NUESTRA LICENCIA.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Aún así, necesitamos su apoyo, para terminar y necesitamos fondos para comprar sillas de mesa, stock y todo lo que necesitamos para abrir.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are Danny, Dylan and Pete; residents of the Arbor Lodge neighborhood.  When LLBC went up for sale, we thought, ""there isn't really a great beer spot with a nice outdoor space to drink year round in Arbor lodge.""  We saw the opportunity, despite the pandemic for that beer garden at LLBC.</p>
<p>The 3 of us don't have the funds to create what we want right now, so we thought we'd take the opportunity to get the community involved and raise some money through this campaign.  The goal of the campaign is to provide future value to our current and future customers in exchange for some money now.  Some of the perks will actually save you money on beer!</p>
<p>In the future, we hope that LLBC and the other businesses on the property will provide a community hub and give back to the community through engagement in civil projects and community service in exchange for your generous contributions!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We have a grand plan to build a spectacular patio complete with coverings for rain and sun, natural gas fire pit, and mixed use open space for yards games/kid play/basking in the sunshine.  We expect that we will need $25-$35K to get the project going and another $10-$20K to put it over the top.  To be clear, we aren't looking for that all to come from the community.  We will be accessing funding from private loans as well as what we can raise from crowdfunding.  </li>
<li>We have some awesome perks, from as low as a few dollars.  Everyone gets a great reward, including beer, swag, challenges, a chance to brew with us.  And anyone who contributes any amount gets their name on a supporters wall at the patio!</li>
<li>Rest assured that every dollar will go towards the project, whether we reach the goal or not.  But the more local support we get the less burden it will put on us to do other things to help develop the brewery and taproom into more than a pub.   </li>

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The three of us are working with professional architects and contractors to make sure the </span>project<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> gets done right! </span>

<p><strong>We are Aldaskeller Wine Co.</strong></p>
<p>Aldaskeller Wine Co. began with Brandon Opalich—a lifelong service industry guy from a wine-loving Italian-Serbian family—who wanted to take his passion for natural wine and create a welcoming space where both seasoned wine lovers and folks new to wine could come together to explore and enjoy the wonders of natural wine. In 2019, Brandon and his wife, Erin Francisco-Opalich, partnered with friend Tim Benedict—humble culinary wizard and kitchen disco king—to host their first food and natural wine pairing pop-ups. Through the connections they made with all the great people who came out to these events, they realized something: Rochester loves natural wine but it’s hard to find locally. Thus, the idea for the Aldaskeller Wine Co. shop was born. We aim to bring natural wine to the people!</p>
<p>Natural wine is our passion; these wines are made from biodynamically farmed grapes and are free from added sulfites, yeasts, and other industrial additives—several of which are derived from animals, including albumen (egg white), isinglass (fish bladder), dairy, and gelatin—that are commonly used to alter the appearance, aroma, and flavor of conventionally produced wines. Natural wines are better for the earth and better for human health. Just like the return to organic food, the natural wine movement seeks to support sustainable agriculture and restore winemaking to its roots, bringing true terroir to wine drinkers around the world. </p>
<p>Contributions to our campaign will help to complete the construction work we’ve started at Aldaskeller’s future home at 289 Gregory Street in the heart of the South Wedge and—most importantly—enable us to purchase the shop’s initial inventory. The more we raise, the greater the variety of wines we’ll have waiting for you on opening day! We’re so grateful for the support from our community and we cannot wait to bring the world of natural wine to Rochester.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>The funds we raise will help offset the costs of the electrical work, painting, flooring, display fabrication, and a refurbished 1970s turntable and sound system arriving from the west coast that will be bumpin’ while you shop and during in-house tastings, meet-the-winemaker events, and workshops. Most of all, the funds raised will help secure the biggest expense: the wine inventory!</p>
<p>To say, ""thank you"" for contributing, you can choose from some awesome PERKS! Perks range from sticker packs and t-shirts designed by artist Jason Look of Look’s Discount, to the Aldaskeller ""After Hours"" experience—a private evening party at the shop with complimentary wine pours for up to five guests. You can also simply make a donation if you’d rather not select a perk.</p>
<p>Even if we don’t reach our entire goal, every little bit helps to cover the work that’s underway. We’re starting the Aldaskeller Wine Co. shop to grow the natural wine movement and serve our community. We’ve been blown away by the excitement and support folks have shown us at our pop-up events and we're heartened by the high demand for environmentally conscious wines here in Rochester. We hope you’ll join us in bringing the first natural wine shop to our region!</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>The pandemic has been hard on so many (us included) and we know that some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help! You can help by making some noise about our campaign. Use the IndieGoGo share buttons at the top of the page to post about the Aldaskeller campaign on social media and spread the word to neighbors, friends, and family. We appreciate your support so much and can't wait to see you in the shop!</p>

<h3>Our Aribaro Story </h3>
<p>Hey paw-friends!</p>
<p>I'm Minkyung Kim, Co-Founder &amp; CEO of Aribaro. After years of trial and error in purchasing healthy pet treats, I literally gave up finding the most natural and healthy products for my pups. Inspired by Ari and Baro (my two lovely Boston-Terriers), I spent the past year sourcing ingredients, collaborating with nutritionists, researching, and developing a new line of healthy, non-GMO pet treats. Spending time with other pet owners made me realize that there was a need for a change in how we feed our pets and providing high-quality treats that are ethically sourced. </p>
<p>Hey friends!</p>
<p>I'm Joelle Choe, Co-Founder &amp; COO of Aribaro. When I heard this idea from my sister-in-business partner, Minkyung, I was on board to make a positive difference in the pet industry. I am passionate about making a good, ethical change in our pet community.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Just like humans, less processed foods are ultimately healthier. Aribaro pet treats are high-quality, locally sourced, certified organic, non-GMO, and have no preservatives. We have formulated these pet treats with nutritionists and chefs that contain high levels of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge for Aribaro has always been our production costs. This includes the cost of our ingredients, packaging, and manufacturing costs.</p>
<p>For the past year, we have been able to fund the business using our savings in our home kitchen in New Jersey. With your help in our Indiegogo campaign, we are optimistic that we can work with our local manufacturer who shares our goals and values. Aribaro strives to be a positive reinforcement in the pet treat industry.</p>

<h3><strong>Have you ever wanted to live in Italy for a little while? </strong></h3>
<p><strong>By backing this project you can stay in a small bungalow in the beautiful region of Molise and experience an authentic and rural Italy. With the possibility to change your booking to a period of equal or lesser value according to availability within 5 years, you can adjust your plans to visit.</strong></p>
<p>Nestled on a hilltop near the small town Montemitro in the beautiful region of Molise, I found the masseria (<i>a type of farmhouse used when working out in the fields</i>) that made me leave my life and work in Norway behind. The stunning panorama at the property, with views towards east, south and west, allows for you to see the sun rise in the morning and also set in the evening. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1617817600/ckw4wzraqhr0vdjl3utj.jpg"" src=""""/><i>Sunrise at Masseria Chicerro.</i></p>
<p>It is the perfect location for my project which has been in the brewing for many years. </p>
<p>The vision for Masseria Chicerro is to establish a tranquil and inspiring work and living environment, where you will have enough time to integrate with the local community and truly experience the rich culture of this little known region.</p>
<p>Six attached bungalows are to be constructed at 570 m above sea level with panoramic views toward west and with the majestic Majella mountains as a backdrop. Here you will be able to enjoy the sunsets from your own private terrace. </p>
<p>I myself live in the original masseria on the property, and I will do my best to help visitors get the best possible experience while staying here.</p>
<p>The building permission for the project has been granted, the contractor has been chosen, and the construction is to start this summer. The first two bungalows are scheduled to be completed by fall 2021.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The bungalows.</h3>
<p>The bungalows are intended for those who want to stay for a longer period in Italy to see what it is like to live and work here. With a bachelor degree in Fine Art I had initially artists in mind, but Masseria Chicerro is also ideal for academics, writers, digital nomads and anyone really who is looking to experience the slow pace of rural living in Italy. Since the pandemic of the Corona virus and lockdowns world wide, the alternative of working online away from the office has been become more of an option for many.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1617817731/ntukpm7zxlscqyshijuk.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>¨</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1617816299/pjesje7tnphks0uzdqd1.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The living units are designed by Architect Johannes Sverdrup who has positioned the 3 modules on slightly different levels in the terrain so that the structure blends gently into the environment. He has also taken care to preserve the view from the original house and courtyard.  </p>
<p>Each bungalow measures 33 m2 and consists of a bedroom, bathroom and an open plan room with a small kitchen where you access the privat terrace. Considering the size of the living units they are best suited for 1 person or a couple.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1617816417/rm7iwtqs9wvx0qiqiqys.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The location of the bungalows is secluded but not too isolated as you can reach Montemitro on foot in 30 minutes, and the Adriatic sea with its never-ending beaches and coastal towns is only 20 min away by car.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1617817502/xd1lcfx945qye5cqgqc8.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The building project is divided into 3 steps. 1 module with 2 attached bungalows constructed in each step. The first part of the project has to be completed without any help from the bank and this is why this campaign is being launched. To help secure the capital needed to complete the first 2 bungalows you can back the project by purchasing a stay as a Perk.  </p>
<p>You can change the period of your Perk to one of equal or lesser value<strong> </strong>according to availability, within 5 years after the completion of the first 2 bungalows.  There will be new Perks added throughout the campaign.</p>
<p>It is also possible to transfer a prepaid stay to someone else, and so it could be the perfect gift for someone with a dream of Italy.</p>
<p>The minimum period to book is 4 weeks.  See the perk options for more details.</p>
<p>Note that the periods of March through May in 2022 and 2023 will not be made available as Perks, as these are needed for the construction of the next 2 modules. </p>
<p>If you are interested in a particular period that is not to be found in the selection of Perks, you can contact me via the ""Ask a question"" link at the top of the page or send an e-mail to project.chicerro@gmail.com. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Montemitro</h3>
<p>Chicerro lies on the outskirts of the small town of Montemitro with less than 400 inhabitants. The town has a small but charming historic center with panoramic views towards the Adriatic sea.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1617816648/ou7xvbvdbu0rii9eosx8.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Montemitro is one of three towns mainly populated by the ethnic minority referred to as Molise Croats. The community originates from refugees fleeing from the Ottoman conquests in the 15th and 16th centuries and they still speak an old Dalmatian dialect of the Croatian language alongside Italian.</p>
<p>It is a welcoming community where it is easy to be included. Montemitro has a bar/cafe, and small grocery shop. You can buy fresh bread from the local baker in the evenings. There is also a post office and a phamarcy.</p>
<p>The small town is <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwjZYtE4D1A"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">situated</a> overlooking the river Trigno which is the natural border between Abruzzo and Molise. This position makes it easy to reach and explore both regions. If you are not planning on renting a car for your stay, you can still get to the larger towns Campobasso, San Salvo, Vasto and Termoli by bus.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>About Molise.</h3>
<p>This is probably the most unknown and unexplored region in Italy, and it is the second smallest region with only two provinces; Campobasso and Isernia. The region is pristine in the sense that there is still no mass tourism to be found here, and the small villages scattered  around on the hill tops has a way of live pretty much unchanged for the last 50 years.  Many claim that coming to Molise is a bit like traveling back in time. You find an authenticity here that you no longer find in the more tourist crowded parts of Italy, and the pace and rhythm is slow and stress free.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1617817943/qfv0iadt7iazedlgro5o.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Molise was listed by New York Times as on of the destinations to visit in 2020 if you are in search of untrammelled, traditional Italy. The newspaper mentions draws like the pristine coastline and mountains providing a wide network of slopes for skiers. You can find Roman settlements like Saepinum which is a complex of baths and a forum that rival those in Italy’s capital , but without the crowds. Hikers can explore the routes of “Transumanza”, the centuries-old tracks, along which sheep and oxen were herded. This network of tracks did also just recently win UNESCO status. New York Times also mention how festivals here are essential to the region’s culture, and throughout the year there is always a “festa” or a “sagra” to visit in Molise.</p>
<p>The region is mainly rural with many small villages with old stone houses clinging on to the mountain tops. </p>

<p><strong>March</strong></p>
<ul style=""margin-left:40px;""><li>
<a href=""https://youtu.be/ZeH2mOieK10"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>The Tufara Carnival</u></a> is a traditional festival on Shrove Tuesday also called ""the Devil of Tufara"" because it has the Devil as its protagonist. The traditional masks are six characters. The group of masks travels around the country in search of proselytes that the Devil and Death try to seduce by jumping and enticing the participants to go with them. The procession ends by entering the ancient Lombard castle where a puppet has been set up to represent the Carnival.</li></ul>
<p><strong><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">April</span></strong></p>
<ul style=""margin-left:40px;""><li>
<a href=""https://youtu.be/2lXb5jW7NR8%C2%A0"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>Festa di Capella</u></a> is the highlight of events in Montemitro. It is a feast of the Chapel of Santa Lucia and an auction of sweets. Every year, on the Sunday following easter, the whole community gathers around 9 in the morning to make a pilgrimage to the small chapel of Santa Lucia, in the location of ""Selo"" not far from Masseria Chicerro. Once arrived at the country church, the holy mass is celebrated. After mass, the families have a picnic in the surrounding green area of the chapel, before attending the auction of cakes and sweets, carefully prepared by the skilled hand of the Montremitran ladies. The proceeds from the auction are used to cover the expenses of organising the party and maintenance of the chapel. This is a very enjoyable and informal event which is my personal favourite so far. It is also a great opportunity to meet all the locals of Montemitro.</li></ul>
<p><strong>May</strong></p>
<ul style=""margin-left:40px;"">
<li>
<u>Festa patronale di Santa Lucia</u>. First and last Friday of May: It is said that the Croatians fleeing theTurkish invasion in the 16th century arrived in Montemitro on a Friday in May, bringing with them a wooden statue of Saint Lucia. On the first Friday of May the Saint is celebrated by carrying her in procession with a band. On the following Fridays there are processions and the last Friday of May there is a patronal festa, with fireworks, bands and celebrations throughout the evening.</li>
<li>

The event is a procession of thirteen large ""living paintings"", the Mysteries, which run through the streets of the city. These machines, also called geniuses, are carried on the shoulders of at least 12 young people for each Mystery, with a cadenced rhythm, marked by the "" mystery "" head. The Mysteries are made with metal structures to which both children and adults are anchored, and the upholstery with collared fabrics makes some characters seem to float in the air.

<h3>Why crowdfunding.</h3>
<p>Because I am still a newcomer in Italy as a permanent resident, I am not yet eligible for a loan with the banks for the first step of the project . This is why I am looking to crowdfunding for some extra back up to complete the construction of the first module with two bungalows.  A successful crowdfunding campaign will also be very helpful when applying for a loan for the remaining bungalows.</p>
</div><div><p>This project is not just important to me personally. It will be a significant contribution to the community here. Like in many rural parts of Italy, they experience that people are leaving the villages for work in the cities, and this project will contribute to bringing new sustainable activity to the area, not just in the high season of summer.</p></div><div><p>As mentioned before, the pace in Italy can be slow sometimes and the bureaucracy can also be very challenging.  I have however tremendous support from the community and the Mayor of Montemitro.  I also work with a very competent business advisor/accountant, a Director of Engineering and a Director of Labour who assist me in overseeing the progress throughout the project. I have myself years of experience from project administration while working for a major consultant company in Norway. </p></div><div><ul></ul></div><p>Even if you are not in a position to back Masseria Chicerro, it will still be a great help if you share this campaign with people you believe would be interested in this project.</p><p>Thank you for your support!</p></div>","Have you ever wanted to live in Italy for a little while? 
By backing this project you can stay in a small bungalow in the beautiful region of Molise and experience an authentic and rural Italy. With the possibility to change your booking to a period of equal or lesser value according to availability within 5 years, you can adjust your plans to visit.
Nestled on a hilltop near the small town Montemitro in the beautiful region of Molise, I found the masseria (a type of farmhouse used when working out in the fields) that made me leave my life and work in Norway behind. The stunning panorama at the property, with views towards east, south and west, allows for you to see the sun rise in the morning and also set in the evening. 
Sunrise at Masseria Chicerro.
It is the perfect location for my project which has been in the brewing for many years. 
The vision for Masseria Chicerro is to establish a tranquil and inspiring work and living environment, where you will have enough time to integrate with the local community and truly experience the rich culture of this little known region.
Six attached bungalows are to be constructed at 570 m above sea level with panoramic views toward west and with the majestic Majella mountains as a backdrop. Here you will be able to enjoy the sunsets from your own private terrace. 
I myself live in the original masseria on the property, and I will do my best to help visitors get the best possible experience while staying here.
The building permission for the project has been granted, the contractor has been chosen, and the construction is to start this summer. The first two bungalows are scheduled to be completed by fall 2021.
 
The bungalows.
The bungalows are intended for those who want to stay for a longer period in Italy to see what it is like to live and work here. With a bachelor degree in Fine Art I had initially artists in mind, but Masseria Chicerro is also ideal for academics, writers, digital nomads and anyone really who is looking to experience the slow pace of rural living in Italy. Since the pandemic of the Corona virus and lockdowns world wide, the alternative of working online away from the office has been become more of an option for many.

¨

 
The living units are designed by Architect Johannes Sverdrup who has positioned the 3 modules on slightly different levels in the terrain so that the structure blends gently into the environment. He has also taken care to preserve the view from the original house and courtyard.  
Each bungalow measures 33 m2 and consists of a bedroom, bathroom and an open plan room with a small kitchen where you access the privat terrace. Considering the size of the living units they are best suited for 1 person or a couple.
 

The location of the bungalows is secluded but not too isolated as you can reach Montemitro on foot in 30 minutes, and the Adriatic sea with its never-ending beaches and coastal towns is only 20 min away by car.

 
The building project is divided into 3 steps. 1 module with 2 attached bungalows constructed in each step. The first part of the project has to be completed without any help from the bank and this is why this campaign is being launched. To help secure the capital needed to complete the first 2 bungalows you can back the project by purchasing a stay as a Perk.  
You can change the period of your Perk to one of equal or lesser value according to availability, within 5 years after the completion of the first 2 bungalows.  There will be new Perks added throughout the campaign.
It is also possible to transfer a prepaid stay to someone else, and so it could be the perfect gift for someone with a dream of Italy.
The minimum period to book is 4 weeks.  See the perk options for more details.
Note that the periods of March through May in 2022 and 2023 will not be made available as Perks, as these are needed for the construction of the next 2 modules. 
If you are interested in a particular period that is not to be found in the selection of Perks, you can contact me via the ""Ask a question"" link at the top of the page or send an e-mail to project.chicerro@gmail.com. 
 
Montemitro
Chicerro lies on the outskirts of the small town of Montemitro with less than 400 inhabitants. The town has a small but charming historic center with panoramic views towards the Adriatic sea.

Montemitro is one of three towns mainly populated by the ethnic minority referred to as Molise Croats. The community originates from refugees fleeing from the Ottoman conquests in the 15th and 16th centuries and they still speak an old Dalmatian dialect of the Croatian language alongside Italian.
It is a welcoming community where it is easy to be included. Montemitro has a bar/cafe, and small grocery shop. You can buy fresh bread from the local baker in the evenings. There is also a post office and a phamarcy.
The small town is situated overlooking the river Trigno which is the natural border between Abruzzo and Molise. This position makes it easy to reach and explore both regions. If you are not planning on renting a car for your stay, you can still get to the larger towns Campobasso, San Salvo, Vasto and Termoli by bus.
 
About Molise.
This is probably the most unknown and unexplored region in Italy, and it is the second smallest region with only two provinces; Campobasso and Isernia. The region is pristine in the sense that there is still no mass tourism to be found here, and the small villages scattered  around on the hill tops has a way of live pretty much unchanged for the last 50 years.  Many claim that coming to Molise is a bit like traveling back in time. You find an authenticity here that you no longer find in the more tourist crowded parts of Italy, and the pace and rhythm is slow and stress free.

Molise was listed by New York Times as on of the destinations to visit in 2020 if you are in search of untrammelled, traditional Italy. The newspaper mentions draws like the pristine coastline and mountains providing a wide network of slopes for skiers. You can find Roman settlements like Saepinum which is a complex of baths and a forum that rival those in Italy’s capital , but without the crowds. Hikers can explore the routes of “Transumanza”, the centuries-old tracks, along which sheep and oxen were herded. This network of tracks did also just recently win UNESCO status. New York Times also mention how festivals here are essential to the region’s culture, and throughout the year there is always a “festa” or a “sagra” to visit in Molise.
The region is mainly rural with many small villages with old stone houses clinging on to the mountain tops. 
 

Activities and Events
There is an abundance of scenic walks to be made in the surrounding area, and the Majellas and the Matese are within reach if you want to do some mountain hiking. There are organised trips offered for hiking, horse trekking, canoeing, biking and much more.
Also locally in Montemitro and the surrounding area it is possible to get guided tours. If you are planning on renting a car while you are here, you can explore as you please on your own and you will of course be provided with tips on where to go.
There is as mentioned before many events throughout the year in the form of ""Festa"" and ""Sagre"". There are too many to list them all here, but below is presented some examples. If you want to know more about what happens in a period you are interested in, you are welcome to contact me and I will do my best to provide you with more information.
March

The Tufara Carnival is a traditional festival on Shrove Tuesday also called ""the Devil of Tufara"" because it has the Devil as its protagonist. The traditional masks are six characters. The group of masks travels around the country in search of proselytes that the Devil and Death try to seduce by jumping and enticing the participants to go with them. The procession ends by entering the ancient Lombard castle where a puppet has been set up to represent the Carnival.
April

Festa di Capella is the highlight of events in Montemitro. It is a feast of the Chapel of Santa Lucia and an auction of sweets. Every year, on the Sunday following easter, the whole community gathers around 9 in the morning to make a pilgrimage to the small chapel of Santa Lucia, in the location of ""Selo"" not far from Masseria Chicerro. Once arrived at the country church, the holy mass is celebrated. After mass, the families have a picnic in the surrounding green area of the chapel, before attending the auction of cakes and sweets, carefully prepared by the skilled hand of the Montremitran ladies. The proceeds from the auction are used to cover the expenses of organising the party and maintenance of the chapel. This is a very enjoyable and informal event which is my personal favourite so far. It is also a great opportunity to meet all the locals of Montemitro.
May


Festa patronale di Santa Lucia. First and last Friday of May: It is said that the Croatians fleeing theTurkish invasion in the 16th century arrived in Montemitro on a Friday in May, bringing with them a wooden statue of Saint Lucia. On the first Friday of May the Saint is celebrated by carrying her in procession with a band. On the following Fridays there are processions and the last Friday of May there is a patronal festa, with fireworks, bands and celebrations throughout the evening.

La Carrese di Ururi. The boys compete with carts pulled by calves, and the adults with carts pulled by oxen. The event, a sporting event linked to religious traditions, takes place on May the 3rd, the day of the solemn patronal feast of the Most Holy Wood of the Cross. A blessing of the big floats starts the real race which starts 4 km from the center of Ururi, where the finish line is, in front of the church of Santa Maria Delle Grazie.

<div>We are Phantom Racing Gear!  We specialize in custom screen printed and embroidered apparel. We are a family owned business that started as a dream and now has been in business for almost 3 years. In 2014 we got a huge contract to sell racing apparel with CRA (Championship Racing Association) a major short track asphalt racing series that puts on events throughout the Midwest from January to October.  We travel with them to every race.  Last year we rented a trailer every weekend and put up pop-up tents with tables to sell our shirts.   We had a very successful year with them and would like to improve our appearance and overall look to our customers with a more professional image. Having our own trailer is a big advantage in several ways.  We save on renting a trailer every week.  We also save on set up and break down time.  It also keeps our merchandise safer and out of the weather.  We saved up enough money to buy an apparel trailer, ordered it, and paid the deposit. It was almost finished when disaster struck with our printer. This very large specialized printer is how we print our artwork on films that transfer to the screens to screen-print our apparel.  Needless to say, it was a huge chunk of the money to fix it and down time of over two weeks waiting for the one repair guy in the Midwest to fit us in, but without our printer we can't produce shirts.  <b>Unfortunately it has left us without the money to finish paying for our trailer which is READY TO BE PICKED UP!

In 2014 we got a huge contract to sell racing apparel with CRA (Championship Racing Association) a major short track asphalt racing series that puts on events throughout the Midwest from January to October.  We travel with them to every race.  Last year we rented a trailer every weekend and put up pop-up tents with tables to sell our shirts.   We had a very successful year with them and would like to improve our appearance and overall look to our customers with a more professional image. Having our own trailer is a big advantage in several ways.  We save on renting a trailer every week.  We also save on set up and break down time.  It also keeps our merchandise safer and out of the weather.  We saved up enough money to buy an apparel trailer, ordered it, and paid the deposit. It was almost finished when disaster struck with our printer. This very large specialized printer is how we print our artwork on films that transfer to the screens to screen-print our apparel.  Needless to say, it was a huge chunk of the money to fix it and down time of over two weeks waiting for the one repair guy in the Midwest to fit us in, but without our printer we can't produce shirts.  Unfortunately it has left us without the money to finish paying for our trailer which is READY TO BE PICKED UP! PLEASE HELP US raise the money for our long term investment. 

What We Need & What You Get

 
We need $6000 dollars to pick up our trailer and to be able buy and install the lighting. We did not have the trailer company do this because it would have added significantly to the cost and we are lucky to have the capability to be able to do it ourselves for less. We want to do something for you. If you donate between $100 - $250 we will send you a custom printed t-shirt.  For donations of more than $250 we will send you a hooded sweatshirt.  Donations of more than $500.00 will receive both a t-shirt and a hoodie.  These will be shipped after the campaign has ended. Even if we do not reach our entire goal (WE HOPE WE DO!) all monies raised will be put toward the pay off of the trailer.

Our goal is to have these amazing Laotian food products available for purchase at farmer’s market, festivals, fairs and online purchases. We hope that in the near future we will be the first Laotian food product available nationwide in retail stores. Kohk &amp; Sahk will produce Laotian food products using authentic ingredients that are familiar and beloved. Be prepared for a nostalgic taste of home cooking. Currently Laotian food is not as easily accessible for those people who do not live amongst a Laotian community but is increasing in popularity and demand. </p><p>I have spent a great amount of time researching and trying to figure out what it will take to get the food from where it is now to where it needs to be.  Due to budget constraints I have decided to start out small and  test out the most popular items which are Laotian style beef jerky also known as “seen savan” which means heavenly beef. Within an hour of the jerky being put out it was gone with so many asking “who made this jerky” and commenting that it was the best Laotian jerky that they had ever tasted. </p><p></p><p>It’s only been a few months but since that day the request for Kohk &amp; Sahk’s Laotian jerky has been growing every week with every batch selling out sometimes even before they can be made.  As a result of this high demand, I realize that I needed to be able to have a large amount of supply handy. Due to the lack of funding and proper equipment, meeting the high demand became problematic. Ergo, I realize that in order to successful fulfill my dream of sustaining my company I needed funding. </p><p></p><p></p><p><b>Why:</b><br/>Although we have been blessed with a growing fan base we have many obstacles to overcome which  requires funding in order to solve it.  Currently we are still in the testing phase where all production takes place at home and given to friends and family to try it.  We know we have a good product but we need monetary assistance in order for us to get our company, Kohk &amp; Sahk off its' feet. Help us bring the  joy of Laotian cuisine into your home. </p><p></p><p><b>What will the money be used for:</b><br/>In order for us to get our company off its' feet, we need to have the proper equipment such as meat slicers, dehydrators and staff. We also would like to keep cost down so that we can continue to provide quality food to everyone at a lower price with bigger quantity for the consumer which means being able to buy things in bulk. We are also working hard to meet the standards and compliance regulation so that we can start taking orders and making it available for everyone to buy which would require us to either look for an approved facility and partners that can get us there. Funds will also go towards development of an E-commerce website that will not only make it easy and convenient for anyone to order from anywhere. Also it will be a great resource vehicle about our company and all Laotian cuisine. Additional funding will also go towards the purchase of appropriate packaging for better quality control. In the next few months we also plan on launching a marketing plan as well as joining different food festivals and farmers market to share our product with everyone. Should there be enough available funding we will put it towards purchasing such items as tents, tables, banners, signage and handouts to ensure every event is a successful one.</p><p></p><p><b>Challenges:</b><br/><i>-Regulations</i><br/>When it comes to food safety, we have to meet USDA standards and regulations in order for our products to be deem safe for public consumption.

It was strictly connected with sports and an active lifestyle. This social project was created out of passion to new technologies and our professional experience in advertisement and marketing. It is the first fully digital water station with pure drinkable water, free WiFi LTE  Internet access and enables the communication with mobile phone users by sending the push notification. </p><p>To enrich the pro-social idea of the project we equipped iStation in a mobile app which the users can benefit from and without any additional activity support chosen charity. </p><p>We haven’t forgotten about the handicapped; the iStation is fully adjusted to their needs as well. Mothers with children can drink water and use the free Internet access. Athletes, runners, cyclists, city officials. And at the end the businessmen can communicate with their employees if something is urgent or in an emergency.</p><p>The number of  benefits that iStation offers is countless. That is why it is so important to develop a network all over the world.</p><p>This project is a dream come true. A dream of innovation, which can change the world. Change the common day, common people. A dream to build and be able to leave behind something meaningful for the society. For humanity.</p><p><br/></p><p>Why we need a support,</p><p>iStation is an innovative project. As each start-up it needs financing to expand it globally.</p><p>The goal of the IndieGoGo campaign is to gain the necessary means to develop the iStation network and introduce it all over the world. We want to reach every citizen in every city. We want to make you aware what iStation is and its magnitude for the society.</p><p>We also aim at gaining global partners who can significantly contribute to the expansion of this project.</p><p><br/></p><div>

</div></div>","Short SummaryAbout the project,The idea of iStation was born in 2013 because we saw the need for such a device. It was strictly connected with sports and an active lifestyle. This social project was created out of passion to new technologies and our professional experience in advertisement and marketing. It is the first fully digital water station with pure drinkable water, free WiFi LTE  Internet access and enables the communication with mobile phone users by sending the push notification. To enrich the pro-social idea of the project we equipped iStation in a mobile app which the users can benefit from and without any additional activity support chosen charity. We haven’t forgotten about the handicapped; the iStation is fully adjusted to their needs as well. Mothers with children can drink water and use the free Internet access. Athletes, runners, cyclists, city officials. And at the end the businessmen can communicate with their employees if something is urgent or in an emergency.The number of  benefits that iStation offers is countless. That is why it is so important to develop a network all over the world.This project is a dream come true. A dream of innovation, which can change the world. Change the common day, common people. A dream to build and be able to leave behind something meaningful for the society. For humanity.Why we need a support,iStation is an innovative project. As each start-up it needs financing to expand it globally.The goal of the IndieGoGo campaign is to gain the necessary means to develop the iStation network and introduce it all over the world.

</p><p>The launch of the Vegan Trade Council represents a milestone
for the vegan community. We now have an association to represent vegan
interests in the marketplace and in the halls of government. The VTC, though having only launched in
January, has received support from many of the top vegan companies, authors,

<p>
</p>
<p>
I
am a former smoker turned vaper. My goal is to bring my pure organic e-juice line of products to the marketplace. Much of the e-juice
currently on the market is pretty sketchy- unsealed bottles, not
childproof, poorly labeled, poor quality ingredients and propylene
glycol-yuck!  I decided to create something pure, organic and natural to vape without weird chemicals like artificial flavors and
propylene glycol. <br/></p>
<p>Here's what we can accomplish with your help:<br/></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Raindrop Vape will become an iconic brand for premium organic naturally
	flavored e-liquids/e-juice.</p>
</li>
<li><p> Launch the company's
	website to bring our product to a global market.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a distribution network to get our products into vape
	shops, bars, convenience stores etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Help adults find smoking alternatives using our far superior organic
	vaping liquids.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul></ul> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need  <br/>

<p>Here

<li>organic
		e-juice ingredients/flavors-I will add to stock gradually with
		profits from sales. 
		</li>
</ul> <p>
</p>
<p></p>
<h3>What Happens If We Don't Reach Our Goal<br/>
</h3>Selling
the e-juice as a retail and wholesale e commerce venture will take
about $2,000. This gets the ingredients I need to produce the organic e-juice. I already have my business license and some inventory. Your
contribution will also provide a bit of a financial cushion for the
website costs until I start selling on the website. All of the
above needs to line up to help support and grow my brand in the
global marketplace.<br/><br/><p>Delays
and shortfalls in any of these steps won’t stop us, but it will
cause us to proceed more slowly and will increase our product costs
because buying ingredients in larger quantities is markedly cheaper.
If the insurance is delayed that means I can’t sell or even produce
the e-juice. If I start off with less equipment/ingredients, my
product line will be less diverse.

<p><b>1. Risiko: Pinguin Effekt</b></p>
<p>Da das Geschäftsmodell auf dem Zusammenbringen von Rentnern und Auftraggebern beruht, ist es für unsere Plattform essenziell, bei beiden Gruppen schnell eine kritische Größe zu erreichen. Gelingt dies nicht, besteht das Risiko, dass ein Rentner eine Dienstleistungen anbietet, diese aber nicht nachgefragt wird. Um die kritische Masse so schnell wie möglich zu erreichen und somit ein Matching durch die Plattform zu gewährleisten, sollen mit konzentrierten Marketingmaßnahmen lokalen ""Hotspots"" aufgebaut werden.</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p><b>2. Risiko: Akzeptanz der Kunden / Image</b></p>
<p>Eine zentrale Rolle spielt auch die Akzeptanz von rentnerado.de bei den Kunden. Dies betrifft nicht nur die Kern-Dienstleistung als solches, sondern auch unsere Werbemaßnahmen, das Image der Webseite und die Qualität der Kommunikation mit unseren Kunden. Um ein adäquates Image aufzubauen, ist in erster Linie auf den Kommunikationsstil mit dem Kunden zu achten. Da Benutzergruppen mit verschiedenen sozialen Ausprägungen angesprochen werden, muss der Kommunikationsstil jeweils entsprechend angepasst werden.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>3. Risiko: Rechtsrisiko</b></p>
<p>Das Betreiben einer kommerziellen Webseite erfordert die Beachtung einer Vielzahl von Informations- und Verhaltenspflichten von Seiten des Betreibers.

Dazu gehört für immer mehr auch eine auf die Bedürfnisse angepasste berufliche Betätigung.
...ist für jede und jeden




... ist spielend einfach für den Auftraggeber:



...wie auch für den Rentner:


Unser Ziel ist es, dass Rentner die Möglichkeit haben, wieder aktiv am Arbeitsmarkt teilzunehmen. Denn Rentner haben uns viel zu bieten. Sie punkten mit Wissen, Erfahrung und Kompetenzen, welche aus ihrem langen Arbeitsleben hervorgehen. 



Und der Clue an der Geschichte: Rentner wollen sich betätigen! Hier nur einige Stimmen:


„Als Single und Pensionär bin ich ewig im ‚Unruhestand‘ und so soll es auch bleiben, denn wer rastet... Gern gebe ich meine fundierten Kenntnisse weiter. Ein Entgelt hat keine Priorität, es muss beiden gefallen. Meine Stärken liegen in der Kreativität und den daraus entspringenden Ergebnissen.“ Jürgen, Rentner aus Weilerswist

„Ich bin seit sieben Jahren Rentner. Da ich mein Leben alng immer gearbeitet habe fehlt mir jetzt ganz einfach eine sinnvolle Beschäftigung, die mich aus dem Rentnerschlendrian heraus holt und mir wieder das Gefühl gibt, gebraucht zu werden.“ Peter, Rentner aus Dingolfing

Algaergy LLC focuses on maximizing the growth cycle and carbon sequestration of microalgae to generate biofuel, a cost-effective, eco-friendly and renewable alternative energy source, utilizing the concept of algae based energy..... ALGAERGY!
Biofuel production from abundant renewable biomass resources is widely considered to be one of the most sustainable alternatives to petroleum based fuels and a viable means for environmentally sustainable energy.
Microalgae, an actively researched and studied alternative source for biofuels, has two major conceptual setbacks.
The Algae Biofuel Bottleneck Issue.....


FIRST:  Algae growth is too slow to generate sustainable large quantities of biomass for biofuel production.

SECOND:  Engineering algae to grow faster result in reduced lipid (fats) biosynthesis leading to inadequate biofuel yields. 




Algaergy LLC Technology to Overcome These Limitations:











Algaergy Platform and Strategy
We, at Algaergy LLC, want your help to fund research and development (R&D) in studying and genetically modifying microalgae for use in generating sustainable, cost-effective and eco-friendly biofuels.


Since incorporation in 2013, our team has worked diligently to research and implement a strategy to overcome the algae biofuel bottleneck issue.

PHASE 1:  SELF-FUNDED START-UP
(2013-2015) 

During our initial 2 years, our team tested a genetic engineering strategy to maximize carbon sequestration in microalgae, thereby maximizing the conversion of C02 & water into increased algae biomass for biofuel production!!!!   Initial results are promising and suggest our technology does increase overall carbon sequestration, chlorophyll content, growth, size and biomass of microalgae compared with lower yields seen in microalgae used in the industry today.

PHASE 2:  INVESTORS & COLLABORATORS - WE NEED YOU!!!
(2015 - 2018) 
PHASE 2 depends on obtaining additional funding for infrastructure, equipment, lab space and on building our team of experts!
We have applied, or have applications in the process, for SBIR-PHASE 1 Grants through the Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation. In addition, we will be presenting our platform to several investors.Our team built Algaergy LLC..... now we need your help to take this technology into production!  PHASE 3:  OUR FUTURE(2018 and beyond) Algaergy LLC technology is based on optimizing the evolutionary conserved process of carbon sequestration.  This process is NOT limited to only microalgae, but can be applied to all orders of plant life!Through collaborations we are currently developing, we will use our strategy of maximizing carbon sequestration in microalgae for biofuels, and apply this same technology for use in other plants for increased crop growth, natural product production and discovery.......





What We Need & What You Get  We need your help to take our research and company to the next level. We are looking to raise $50,000 -100,000 through crowdfunding. With your help, you will become a part of the Algaergy LLC team!! If we are unable to meet our target goals, all funds will still go towards research and development and we will keep you updated on our progress.    




The Impact
The possibility of deriving biofuels from locally grown sources, such as microalgae ponds or farms, and using them as alternatives to petrol products is an attractive alternative to fossil fuels.  Investment in biofuel development will also lead to a significant boost in future economical development, such as increased need for algae farms and labor.  Energy consumption is estimated to increase by 84% by 2035, and new sources of energy, such as biofuels, will be needed to meet this demand.
With research and development focused toward advancing appropriate production methods, biofuels should produce fewer greenhouse gases than are currently produced by fossil fuels, and as such have a lower overall carbon footprint.  The Algaergy LLC team has dedicated over 2 years to building a genetic engineering strategy to increase the carbon sequestration rate of microalgae, thus increasing overall algae biomass for biofuel production.  Help us shape the future of cost-effective production of biofuels and alternative energy!






Risks & Challenges  The biggest hurdle faced by current companies working on extracting biofuels from microalgae is overall sustainability due to slow algae growth and/or lipid content. We, with your help, would be working on lowering the barriers of entry for these companies by providing a solution on sustainable rapid algae growth that maximizes carbon sequestration and the creation of necessary algae byproducts for biofuel production.

</div></div>","Social Enterprise Sisterhood Start Up 



Hi, I'm Juliet, social entrepreneur, global ambassador for empowering women, and slightly embarrassed that the above video took several thousand takes. I live in Zimbabwe, Africa, and I want to help empower women entrepreneurs to lift themselves out of poverty in Africa. But, this campaign isn't just about those amazing women who hustle to survive in extraordinary circumstances. 

It's also about you. 
You're on Indiegogo. That means you think outside the box. You want to disrupt the normal way of doing things, you're part of the cutting edge. And if you want to matter, if you want to make a difference, if you want to be part of something bigger - able to give a little to make a huge impact,  you are in the right place. 
Why work to empower women entrepreneurs in Africa?
African women are often stuck in poverty as they face a range of factors that discriminate against them - laws, policies, family and society norms and cultural practices - all these things  add up to them often being at the bottom of the heap. And the only way out is for them to be able to make a living. In a country with over 90% unemployment, you have to hustle to survive - so entrepreneurship is the ONLY option for most people. Did you know that in many countries in southern Africa, under Dutch Roman law, married women were designated legal minors (ie treated the same as children) -  unable to own property, open a bank account or go to a doctor without the consent of an adult male relative - husband, brother or father? The laws are being changed but it takes longer for society's attitudes to catch up. So for many women in Africa. every day is a constant exhausting battle for survival. A daily grind. But together, we can change that. 
The Social Enterprise Sisterhood
We're building a powerful alliance of movers and shakers like you - so that we can leverage the internet to crowdsource solutions for women who are stuck in poverty. The Social Enterprise Sisterhood is the bridge between you - someone who wants to do business and do good - and women in Africa who need access to information, training, mentoring and resources to get off the starting blocks. 
 You can provide the helping hand - ideas, resources, skills, support, even finances - that they need to lift themselves out of poverty. Together we can empower women to grow their businesses,  attain financial freedom, and have real choices, real chances and real options to be safe and work towards the life they want. 
What we've done so far
I've spent a year laying the groundwork for the Social Enterprise Sisterhood and it's been great! We started off with a study to identify what's needed to grow women's enterprise, we've held workshops to train women entrepreneurs in Zimbabwe on marketing and mindset, we've done given out some grants and done some awareness raising and PR. Heck. I've even gave a TEDx talk to raise awareness of the issue, and I've been handpicked as Global Ambassador for a prestigious group that are empowering a billion women by 2020. It's been brilliant, but basically it's time for help. I've drained my savings, maxed out my credit card and I've cut back on my (income earning) consulting so I can make time to drive this forward.

(Because who doesn't love a perk?!) Just take a look on the right! There's a perk to suit every pocket.
Here's the cost breakdown




Air fares: $4100.

</div></div>","Summary

Since 1996 our local Habitat for Humanity affiliate, Lancaster/Northumberland Habitat for Humanity (LNHFH) has been giving deserving neighbors a hand up, not a handout by constructing affordable homes that those selected as Habitat’s partners purchase when completed. 
That’s right: Habitat homeowners purchase their homes – no outright gifts. We’re located in a rural area where affordable housing isn’t always available for many of our neighbors. Still, we have built sixteen homes and are now completing #17, and for twenty years we’ve been able to keep costs to homeowners low. 
How is that possible? Two ways: 
1.   Volunteer labor keeps construction costs low, so the total cost of a mortgage is quite affordable.
2.   No-interest Mortgages allow homeowners to repay only the costs LNHFH incurs for materials and some professional services.
But let’s face it: Providing affordable homes and no-interest mortgages isn’t easy. So—LNHFH needs funds to purchase building materials and pay for services like water and sewer hookups and specialized services. 

What We Need & What You Get
For LNHFH to carry out its mission of constructing affordable housing, we need cash donations. Today the costs for building a two- or three-bedroom home of approximately 1,500 square feet in a community in Virginia’s Northern Neck runs to $100,000 or more, depending on expenses for site preparation, permits and other associated costs.
We build each home on a pay-as-you-go basis: We collect funds from friends and neighbors who believe in the work we do. Donations of any size are welcome. As we receive donations we purchase materials to begin and complete construction. The faster we achieve our goal of $100,000 for each home, the sooner we can complete construction and move on to the next one.
House #17 is already framed and under roof.  We are confident we'll complete it in time, but your contribution today will help us put in the foundation for our next home (#18) and make it easier to attract additional funding for house #18 once we can show other funders that the work is underway.

The Impact
There’s nothing more rewarding than seeing the smiles of new homeowners at the dedication ceremony for homes they help construct. That’s right – all Habitat homeowners put in 300 hours of “sweat equity” constructing the homes they’ll live in. In an area where affordable housing is scarce and nearly half the population lives dangerously close to the poverty line, Habitat homes are making a real difference.


    We have the land and we have the people.  We just need to increase the flow of funds.  Please help change the lives of our families and help their future generations lead a better life through the pride of homeownership.   Help us change lives and our community for the better.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

I started SpotMe Mobile several months ago from an idea that why can't we make money transferring between our peers more socially interactive. With the current mobile social boom going on, our goal is to bring you a mobile app that refines how we deal with money between our peers. Giving people a more related and convenient experience of peer to peer money transferring in our daily lives.</p><p>As mobile money transactions are slowly becoming the norm, this app will be the starting point for us to incorporate more features in the future such as a digital wallet. Yes, there is currently a lot of great money transferring mobile apps available on the market. But as a designer, I always strive to improve something and fill in the missing pieces.</p><p> </p><h3>SpotMe Mobile Needs Your Help!</h3><p>After months of designing and refining the layout to create a prototype that we believe gives you a more social user experience. Now SpotMe Mobile needs your help to get to development and bring this concept to life.</p><p>Our ultimate goal here is to raise 50k and all proceeds will go to the development, testing, and the live launch on App store and Google play.

I started SpotMe Mobile several months ago from an idea that why can't we make money transferring between our peers more socially interactive. With the current mobile social boom going on, our goal is to bring you a mobile app that refines how we deal with money between our peers. Giving people a more related and convenient experience of peer to peer money transferring in our daily lives.As mobile money transactions are slowly becoming the norm, this app will be the starting point for us to incorporate more features in the future such as a digital wallet. Yes, there is currently a lot of great money transferring mobile apps available on the market. But as a designer, I always strive to improve something and fill in the missing pieces. SpotMe Mobile Needs Your Help!After months of designing and refining the layout to create a prototype that we believe gives you a more social user experience. Now SpotMe Mobile needs your help to get to development and bring this concept to life.Our ultimate goal here is to raise 50k and all proceeds will go to the development, testing, and the live launch on App store and Google play. If the 50k is not fully met, we will still be able to get our app into development. Because we have a great team that has the same passion for SpotMe to succeed, any remaining cost necessary to bring SpotMe Mobile to development will be funded.

<p>Hello dear present and future friends. Some of you seeing this campaign might already know me but for those of you who don't my name is Mynah Marie and I'm a 34-years old musician who's been on the road for over 12 years and lived in 6 different countries. </p>
<p>In November 2014, I visited Kathmandu, Nepal. At the time I was living in India and my trip to Nepal was nothing more than a formality in order to get my Indian visa renewal. The day after my arrival, I found myself blessed by life and through a series of coincidences I met one of the most beautiful communities of people I'd ever seen. </p>
<p><b>In the little neighbourhood of Swayambhu, in the outskirts of Kathmandu, there is a group of people who work hard every day to improve the life of the people in their community. </b></p>

</div></div>","Helping people who are helping people
Hello dear present and future friends. Some of you seeing this campaign might already know me but for those of you who don't my name is Mynah Marie and I'm a 34-years old musician who's been on the road for over 12 years and lived in 6 different countries. 
In November 2014, I visited Kathmandu, Nepal. At the time I was living in India and my trip to Nepal was nothing more than a formality in order to get my Indian visa renewal. The day after my arrival, I found myself blessed by life and through a series of coincidences I met one of the most beautiful communities of people I'd ever seen. 
In the little neighbourhood of Swayambhu, in the outskirts of Kathmandu, there is a group of people who work hard every day to improve the life of the people in their community. 



They host the Swayambhu Community School , where children go after their classes to receive not only help for their homework but also learn about Art, meditation and how to take care of the environment. Meditation classes are given to the children by Amir Lama and the Art program ""Colourful Hands"", aiming to teach children to free their creativity, is given by the contemporary and traditional thangka artist Krishna Thing.

The children of the school also participate in weekly cleaning campaigns held every Saturday. By including them in the responsibility of having a clean environment, Krishna and Amir hope to pass on the their students some important human values, such as the respect of the environment and of others, by encouraging them to action.
They have created and put into place the ""True Citizens Campaign"" as an initiative of a group of young-spirited people from around the globe. They have chosen to take responsibility for sensitizing others to the value of all aspects of human life by offering their knowledge, artistic expression and experience to the benefit of the community. 

They have created foundations (AANGAN Foundation , Studio MANDALA) to support the projects and initiatives of the community and of the people involved in the True Citizens Campaign. Some of the initiatives of these foundations include: a four days free health camp in Sindhupalchock district where they served around 800 patients with a health check up along with necessary health counselling and free medicine distribution, provided scholarships to high school students in Lalitpur from 2009 to 2011, built gender friendly toilets in public schools of Kathmandu in 2010, implemented an ECD (Early Child Development) school in Banskharka to secure children’s Right to Education, started agricultural projects in Lisankhu to empower women to genarate income, conducted various trainings in agriculture and animal husbandry for women in Lamatar of Lalitpur, conducted awareness campaigns and workshops to the high school students in Lisankhu to utilize the right to information for the development of their community and held several exhibitions in different parts of UK for charity and selling Nepali handicrafts to raise funds for future projects.


Some of them are also artists and musicians dedicated to protect, spread and educate people around the globe about the traditional Art, music and culture of Nepal. Member of the True Citizen Campaign, Krishna Thing was born in 1979 in the East of Nepal. He started his artistic career 20 years ago in Kathmandu. After studying with thangka masters and working as an apprentice for many years, Krishna earned his living from thangka painting for 7 years before deciding on changing his artistic direction by adding contemporary elements. Below is a picture of one of his paintings called ""OUR VISION"".

In other projects, Krishna teams up with artists from all over the World to use Art to sensitize people on social or environmental issues. By transforming waste materials into beautiful and compelling pieces of art work, Krishna Thing and other like minded artists hope to pass on a strong message to sensitize people from around the globe to certain realities of their country and culture. In collaboration with the organization Da Mind Tree , Krishna and a group of people travel every year to the Mount Everest to collect whatever pieces of garbage they can find. In the year of 2013, they collected over a tone and a half of waste on the mountain. With the waste that was collected, Krishna and the other members created the sculptures that were to be exposed in the Visual Art Symposium, not only in Nepal but also in France, Sweden and India. See Krishna Thing with the Mount Everest Project  
In addition of being active on so many levels in their community, they also provide a safe haven for foreigners like me, travellers from abroad that sometimes have lost their way in a culture that can be so different. They welcome everybody with opens arms and so much patience to explain and to help in whatever way is needed. 

From them I've gained so much inspiration and strength. Because of them, I will always carry Nepal in my heart as a place to come back to, where it feels like home.
Now disaster has struck. The news from the ground in Nepal, coming directly from people who are living the disaster, is that much help is needed. Houses are destroyed. They live on the ground. Many families are homeless and have no food or drinking water. Sickness is settling in. Still, this group of people is there everyday, helping the community and trying to provide what is needed to as many people as possible.
This crowdfunding campaign is an attempt for me to try and give back. I am reaching out to you, dear friends, to help me support a community of people that truly deserves it, in a huge time of need.
What They Need & What They Will Do


Any money donation, even if very small, will be greatly appreciated. Your 5$ might seem insignificant in your reality but it can actually mean food for a family for a day or two. 5$ makes a difference, it really does.

The funds collected will go straight to Amir Lama, president of the Aangan Foundation. With the support of the foundation, Amir Lama and the close members of the community will take the responsibility to distribute the funds through appropriate organizations working on the ground in Kathmandu and they will personally help the children of the community and their families by providing medicine packs, food, water and help in any way possible or needed. 

After the earthquake  I personally sent money to Amir Lama and this is the message he wrote back to me : ""Thank you Mynah, for your rewarding role to support children effected by earthquake in Nepal. Just to confirm I have received the money from your family. We have distributed emergency relief family packs including rice, lentil, cooking oil, salt, sugar, biscuits and noodles, for the pregnant women and child under 3 years, viva and lactogen, water purification liquid and mosquito net, around Swayambhu and Nuwakot. I will share you our activities photos with more details in next message, when I will have proper access to internet. With lots of love and respect"".

<p>Imagine being able to support your favorite charity or cause by simply being counted, without having to donate any more money, by simply living your live on purpose. The Purpose United Project (PUP) social network was created to do just that. Now you can support your youth sports team, your faith, wounded vets, find a cure for cancer, and countless other worthy causes by just downloading the free Purpose United Project mobile app and selecting your favorite Causes. Your simple vote earns your favorite cause a sustainable monthly funding stream from local business sponsors. You never are asked to give money, just try and shop on purpose by patronizing the local supportive businesses that are supporting the Causes you hold dear.  As a thank you for using the Purpose United Project mobile apps and online directories our sponsoring businesses in every city post incredible deals on just about anything you may ever want.  Join the PUP unified community of Great Causes, Caring People and Supportive Businesses. Together we spread awareness of our community's needs and build a sustainable funding stream for the Great Causes that are meeting these many needs.  <br/></p>

</div><div>
<h3>PUP Overview</h3> <p></p>
<p>The Purpose United Project (PUP) is a social entrepreneurial venture that concentrates its efforts on a double bottom line: 1) Profitable returns for its stakeholders, and 2) Positive Community Impact. We accomplish these objectives through the creation of a sustainable businesses model based on high- margin, localized digital advertising services. A percentage of the proceeds from advertising sales in each city creates a monthly funding pool that is shared with our member-selected Charity organizations in each city we operate in. As social entrepreneurs, PUP believes that all businesses should make community development a major part of their business model. Rather than hording profits, the social entrepreneur invests retained earnings back into the communities they are doing business in. Beyond the cash flow needed to ensure our sustainable business model, all funds will go back into the communities through monthly financial support of the Charities our members have voted for. It is our ultimate goal to have up to 75% of all advertising revenue go back into supporting our communities through great paying local jobs and Charity support. Could you imagine if other social networks, such as Facebook, did the same... instead of making a few people incredibly rich they took those billions in profits and gave it back to the community. The Purpose United Project will be doing just that. With your help, we will lead the way in leveraging a social network for doing good, for supporting our member's chosen causes, for making our world a better place. </p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>PUP Business Model</b></p>
<p><b>Purpose United Project</b> creates a social movement of <b>Great Causes, Caring People, </b>and <b>Supportive Businesses </b>that unite for the purpose of driving greater awareness of their community's needs, and creating sustainable funding streams to help meet those needs. This Purpose United Project social network facilitates the mutually beneficial relationships between these three parties. <b><i>Great Causes</i></b> are able realize the untapped value in the size of their current supporter network by simply asking them to become part of the PUP social movement on their behalf. Cause organizations use their current channels of communication to ask their supporters to download the free Purpose United Project mobile app and vote for them. That's it! Every month the Cause will receive a check for their portion of their city's PUP funding pool.  The more people that vote for them, the greater their portion of the monthly funding pool. In this way, charities are able to leverage their social collateral like never before. <b><i>Caring People</i></b> are able to support their chosen causes by simply downloading the free PUP mobile app, voting for their favorite Causes, and finding local Cause-supporting businesses that offer incredible PUP member-only deals. No purchase is ever necessary, as Causes are funded through the sponsorship of local caring businesses. By patronizing PUP-supporting businesses, members ensure that these businesses will keep supporting our member’s Causes through continued advertising. By sharing PUP with friends and family, supporters help spread the PUP movement of caring people. <b>Supportive Businesses </b>enjoy unparalleled digital advertising results, as their ads and daily deals are shared with the loyal and motivated network of PUP supporters through the PUP mobile app, online business directory, and targeted opt-in email distributions.  A loyal, mutually beneficial relationship is formed as PUP members support the businesses that are supporting the Causes they care about, and these businesses respond with incredible PUP member-only deals. Now businesses can enjoy building their customer base while supporting their community's charities with their advertising sponsorship on the PUP network. PUP creates a truly beneficial relationship between all parties involved.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Why PUP Works:</b></p>
<p>By creating a unique value proposition for each of these three groups, the Purpose United Project creates high user engagement resulting in a loyal network of participants that viral spread the growth of PUP to their friends and family. Every party benefits from PUP. Charities receive sustainable funding. Members get great deals on countless products and services. Businesses enjoy truly effective Cause-related marketing for one low monthly fee. As the PUP member base grows in each city it creates an attractive advertising channel that results in the sustainable business model needed to meet our profit and community development goals and mandates.</p>
<p>The PUP business model is monetized along the lines of other social media organizations. The growing population of engaged members attracts the advertising revenue. The higher the population of engaged users, the more valuable this advertising channel becomes. Our integrated digital marketing platforms have a very low cost of service. The low cost of service combined with the recurring monthly revenue stream create a highly profitable business model. This model can afford to provide sustainable funding for charities as a result of the charities being the mechanism by which the member population is acquired. The Purpose United Project has virtually no customer acquisition costs and very low product production and delivery costs. These cost savings are the basis for creating high paying local jobs in each community while providing millions of dollars of monthly financial support for our member’s chosen Causes. Unlike other social media platforms, we distribute the majority of profits back into the community rather than hording it. </p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Roll out Strategy:</b></p>
<p>Phase One:  The initial roll out market of Rochester, NY will be performed by the PUP sales team. During this 3-6 month test market phase, we will be standardizing the collateral and sales techniques needed for the nationwide rollout. </p>
<p>Phase Two:  Once the Rochester, NY market has been effectively launched and procedures cemented, we will then concentrate on multi-city roll outs via licensed re-sellers. These re-sellers will be comprised of established local media, advertising and sales organizations. Through the use of these strategic channel partners, the PUP organization will transform from an advertising sales organization into the technology and operations support hub for a nation of strategic re-sellers. </p>
<p>Once we transition from advertising sales to a support hub, our concentration will be focused in four main areas: 1) Re-seller recruitment and support, 2) Charity recruitment and support, 3) Product innovation and development, 4) Nationwide branding and marketing. By concentrating our efforts on recruiting and supporting local re-sellers in each city market, we will foster expedited market penetration with the much lower capital requirements of this ""franchise"" model. In addition to the financial benefits of a ""franchise"" model, there are exceptional benefits realized from the embedded market presence each media and advertising organization already enjoys in their ""home markets"". Their current sales relationships with local businesses in each city will ensure expedited roll out of PUP in each new market. </p>
<p>The ultimate PUP corporate goals of driving awareness of each community's needs, creating sustainable funding streams for the Cause organizations that meet these many needs, and the creation of a sustainable, profitable business model for all PUP stakeholders will be realized through the collaborative effort of PUP corporate supporting our locally licensed re-sellers who work hand-in-hand with local Great Causes, Caring People, and Supportive Businesses in each city. </p>

</div></div>","Short Summary If you could change the world by just being you, would you? If you could help cure diseases, house the homeless, teach a child by simply clicking a button, would you?  ...Go ahead, click the button, start changing your world today.
Imagine being able to support your favorite charity or cause by simply being counted, without having to donate any more money, by simply living your live on purpose. The Purpose United Project (PUP) social network was created to do just that. Now you can support your youth sports team, your faith, wounded vets, find a cure for cancer, and countless other worthy causes by just downloading the free Purpose United Project mobile app and selecting your favorite Causes. Your simple vote earns your favorite cause a sustainable monthly funding stream from local business sponsors. You never are asked to give money, just try and shop on purpose by patronizing the local supportive businesses that are supporting the Causes you hold dear.  As a thank you for using the Purpose United Project mobile apps and online directories our sponsoring businesses in every city post incredible deals on just about anything you may ever want.  Join the PUP unified community of Great Causes, Caring People and Supportive Businesses. Together we spread awareness of our community's needs and build a sustainable funding stream for the Great Causes that are meeting these many needs.  


PUP Overview 
The Purpose United Project (PUP) is a social entrepreneurial venture that concentrates its efforts on a double bottom line: 1) Profitable returns for its stakeholders, and 2) Positive Community Impact. We accomplish these objectives through the creation of a sustainable businesses model based on high- margin, localized digital advertising services. A percentage of the proceeds from advertising sales in each city creates a monthly funding pool that is shared with our member-selected Charity organizations in each city we operate in. As social entrepreneurs, PUP believes that all businesses should make community development a major part of their business model. Rather than hording profits, the social entrepreneur invests retained earnings back into the communities they are doing business in. Beyond the cash flow needed to ensure our sustainable business model, all funds will go back into the communities through monthly financial support of the Charities our members have voted for. It is our ultimate goal to have up to 75% of all advertising revenue go back into supporting our communities through great paying local jobs and Charity support. Could you imagine if other social networks, such as Facebook, did the same... instead of making a few people incredibly rich they took those billions in profits and gave it back to the community. The Purpose United Project will be doing just that. With your help, we will lead the way in leveraging a social network for doing good, for supporting our member's chosen causes, for making our world a better place. 

PUP Business Model
Purpose United Project creates a social movement of Great Causes, Caring People, and Supportive Businesses that unite for the purpose of driving greater awareness of their community's needs, and creating sustainable funding streams to help meet those needs. This Purpose United Project social network facilitates the mutually beneficial relationships between these three parties. Great Causes are able realize the untapped value in the size of their current supporter network by simply asking them to become part of the PUP social movement on their behalf. Cause organizations use their current channels of communication to ask their supporters to download the free Purpose United Project mobile app and vote for them. That's it! Every month the Cause will receive a check for their portion of their city's PUP funding pool.  The more people that vote for them, the greater their portion of the monthly funding pool. In this way, charities are able to leverage their social collateral like never before. Caring People are able to support their chosen causes by simply downloading the free PUP mobile app, voting for their favorite Causes, and finding local Cause-supporting businesses that offer incredible PUP member-only deals. No purchase is ever necessary, as Causes are funded through the sponsorship of local caring businesses. By patronizing PUP-supporting businesses, members ensure that these businesses will keep supporting our member’s Causes through continued advertising. By sharing PUP with friends and family, supporters help spread the PUP movement of caring people. Supportive Businesses enjoy unparalleled digital advertising results, as their ads and daily deals are shared with the loyal and motivated network of PUP supporters through the PUP mobile app, online business directory, and targeted opt-in email distributions.  A loyal, mutually beneficial relationship is formed as PUP members support the businesses that are supporting the Causes they care about, and these businesses respond with incredible PUP member-only deals. Now businesses can enjoy building their customer base while supporting their community's charities with their advertising sponsorship on the PUP network. PUP creates a truly beneficial relationship between all parties involved.

Why PUP Works:
By creating a unique value proposition for each of these three groups, the Purpose United Project creates high user engagement resulting in a loyal network of participants that viral spread the growth of PUP to their friends and family. Every party benefits from PUP. Charities receive sustainable funding. Members get great deals on countless products and services. Businesses enjoy truly effective Cause-related marketing for one low monthly fee. As the PUP member base grows in each city it creates an attractive advertising channel that results in the sustainable business model needed to meet our profit and community development goals and mandates.
The PUP business model is monetized along the lines of other social media organizations. The growing population of engaged members attracts the advertising revenue. The higher the population of engaged users, the more valuable this advertising channel becomes. Our integrated digital marketing platforms have a very low cost of service. The low cost of service combined with the recurring monthly revenue stream create a highly profitable business model. This model can afford to provide sustainable funding for charities as a result of the charities being the mechanism by which the member population is acquired. The Purpose United Project has virtually no customer acquisition costs and very low product production and delivery costs. These cost savings are the basis for creating high paying local jobs in each community while providing millions of dollars of monthly financial support for our member’s chosen Causes. Unlike other social media platforms, we distribute the majority of profits back into the community rather than hording it. 

Roll out Strategy:
Phase One:  The initial roll out market of Rochester, NY will be performed by the PUP sales team. During this 3-6 month test market phase, we will be standardizing the collateral and sales techniques needed for the nationwide rollout. 
Phase Two:  Once the Rochester, NY market has been effectively launched and procedures cemented, we will then concentrate on multi-city roll outs via licensed re-sellers. These re-sellers will be comprised of established local media, advertising and sales organizations. Through the use of these strategic channel partners, the PUP organization will transform from an advertising sales organization into the technology and operations support hub for a nation of strategic re-sellers. 
Once we transition from advertising sales to a support hub, our concentration will be focused in four main areas: 1) Re-seller recruitment and support, 2) Charity recruitment and support, 3) Product innovation and development, 4) Nationwide branding and marketing. By concentrating our efforts on recruiting and supporting local re-sellers in each city market, we will foster expedited market penetration with the much lower capital requirements of this ""franchise"" model. In addition to the financial benefits of a ""franchise"" model, there are exceptional benefits realized from the embedded market presence each media and advertising organization already enjoys in their ""home markets"". Their current sales relationships with local businesses in each city will ensure expedited roll out of PUP in each new market. 
The ultimate PUP corporate goals of driving awareness of each community's needs, creating sustainable funding streams for the Cause organizations that meet these many needs, and the creation of a sustainable, profitable business model for all PUP stakeholders will be realized through the collaborative effort of PUP corporate supporting our locally licensed re-sellers who work hand-in-hand with local Great Causes, Caring People, and Supportive Businesses in each city.

</div><p>  Everyone can do with a little extra cash, and for some of us
it can make all the difference - single parents, students, those on low incomes

convert unused time to bonus cash, for example a stay-at-home parent who has
several hours a day free while the kids are at school and could easily bake
cupcakes or do some gardening.</p><p>  Doing
odd jobs often comes to the convenience of everyone.  Someone can be on their way home on the bus

Bobblejob will have three layers of service.</p><h4>Free Accounts</h4><p> Free Accounts are exactly that. There's no subscription charge and no need for a fee to post a job (a small commission must be given, but this is taken from the job seeker when final payment is made). It's a good way to see if anyone is interested in the area to do your job, or to browse to see what kind of work is around you. However as you won't be as clearly verified as well as a Silver account holder, there will be a short delay between you posting a job and it appearing on the site. This allows us to manually vet the job before it is visible to all.</p><p>Free accounts don't allow internal messaging until a bid is accepted, at which point you can arrange fine details. </p><p>Free accounts must place a small deposit on a job, of which a fee will be deducted as a commission from the seeker's payment, thus making it effectively free to post the job.</p><h4>Silver Accounts</h4><p> Silver Accounts provide an extra layer of service, for a small subscription (we're estimating about £2 per month). For this the account holder gets the following benefits:</p><ul>
<li>As you'll have effectively verified yourself by providing subscription details the delay between posting a job and having it go live will no longer be needed. </li>
<li>Silver accounts allow in-app messaging, so you can ask and answer questions about bids and separately arrange prices and offers without public bidding. </li>
<li>Silver accounts also push any jobs you post up the search rankings so they are easier to see - we regard a Silver account holder as having proved that they're serious about getting their job done. Jobs posted by Silver members are marked as such for anyone to see that they come from a regular job poster.</li>
<li>You'll also get 5 jobs per month where you don't have to put in a deposit.</li>
<li>Silver accounts are suitable for everyone, but especially for job posters. </li>
</ul><h4>Gold Accounts</h4><p> Gold Accounts are for those who do more regular handyman work or want to use Bobblejob more seriously. For ten pounds a month the following benefits are given:</p><ul>
<li>Instant messages and notifications - for example of a new job posting locally.</li>
<li>Searchable in reverse - one can look for anyone who does grass cutting work within three miles, for example. </li>
<li>Can receive nudges to be invited to bid on a job.</li>
<li>Can always be messaged, even by free account holders.</li>
<li>All deposits and commissions are waived.</li>
<li>Jobs and profiles are promoted and have increased search rankings</li>
<li>No on-site advertising</li>
<li>Gold accounts receive their own mini-site, where they can display their own profile, skills list, certifications and certificates, job history and CV that they can distribute as they will to advertise themselves. This site will be fully search engine optimised for Google and the like.</li>
</ul><p><br/></p><p></p><div> </div> <div> </div><h3>The Impact</h3><div> </div><p></p><div>
</div><p>  We expect there to be three levels of impact.</p><div>
</div><p>  The first is the obvious one of getting those odd-jobs done
that you’ve been too busy to do, avoiding
or don’t have the required skill to do. </p><div>
</div><p>  The second is earning some money by using your spare time or
skills. We’ve had someone earn hundreds of pounds from painting a huge pool
wall, and we’ve had another earn a plate of cupcakes by helping someone set up
and learn to use their mobile phone. </p><div>
</div><p>  The third and in some ways the most important impact is what Bobblejob can
do for the local community. We
believe Bobblejob will foster a community spirit and a sense of people in the
neighbourhood helping each other to get things done. This is especially true for schools,
churches or local charities. We also have the ability to handle charity and
unpaid work - for example, a school could post a job looking for a dozen people
to help with the school fair, or a charity could recruit people to act as
marshals for a sponsored event. In addition, we have a innovative schools system
coming shortly, in which older students looking for work experience can be part
of a group together with the school parents, staff and administrators. For
security, those students use reduced authority accounts which only allows them
to see jobs posted by the school community once they log in. The school
admins have the ability to oversee everything.</p><p>  A student with a record of two
dozen jobs done and an average four-and-a-half star rating has a better
chance of being accepted for any application, whether university or their
first job, than someone with no work background at all.  This is basically a mini-Bobblejob setup, a
micro-site. We have
planned to add a “graduation” display or printable
“CV” of jobs done, rewards earned and ratings given for students who leave the
school. Parents, of course, have full Bobblejob accounts and
can see or post jobs outside the school environment if they wish. </p><p>  A similar, but less restrictive university system should go live
during this Indiegogo campaign, if it hasn’t already when you read this. We’ll expand it to a
general groups system later, so anyone could set up their own private groups
(e.g. babysitting groups) if they wish.</p><div>
</div><div><br/></div><div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445857173/zy4mkyaigmf3rvxhixzu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div><div><i>Not everyone likes flat-pack furniture assembly instructions...</i></div><div><br/></div><ul> </ul><div> </div> <div> </div><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3><div> </div><p> </p><div>
</div><p>  Making Bobblejob a success is not a trivial task. We’re
convinced that we’ve got a good concept, but for it to become a self-sustaining
operation we need to have plenty of members posting plenty of jobs so others
locally in their communities can bid on them and do them. If the nearest jobs
are a hundred miles away then it’s too far to get involved. In some ways we’re
like an early version of ebay or any other auction site – you have to have
enough content to bring people in to see what’s there, and enough people coming
in and bidding to make it worth putting content on. We're like a car that needs its engine
to “turn over” enough to fire – once we’re running then we believe that we can
continue to thrive.</p><div>
</div><div><br/></div><h3>The Future</h3><div>
<p>  Further developments to the site should include:</p>
<p>  Enhanced School, University and Group accounts (as
mentioned)<br/>
  Phone apps<br/><br/><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>  Enhanced accounts. Bobblejob is free to use, but there will be two levels of
subscription based enhanced accounts. The silver accounts will provide in-app
messaging and the ability to pay each other electronically (via Paypal), and
they’ll have priority in searches. This will be a minimal monthly cost. The
gold accounts will cost slightly more and are intended for more serious
handymen – they’ll be provided a minisite of their own to advertise their
skills and work history, plus post up any document scans of certifications or
qualifications such as safety certificates or background checks, plus they’ll
be searchable by work type and area.</span></p>

<p><br/></p>
</div><div> </div> <div> </div><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><div> </div><p>
</p><div>
</div><p>  This is an Indiegogo project request, so of course we’re
asking for money – but money isn’t really all we’re asking for. We’re after
people who will join us in working to make our communities brighter and
cleaner, to repair what’s broken and look after those who need help. We’re
after people who will help charities in their work. We’re after those who have
work they need done and projects they want help with.</p><div>
</div><p>  In short, we’re after <i>members</i>.
We’re after people who will sign up and use Bobblejob the way it’s meant to be
used; people who will convince their friends, their families and their clients
and suppliers to sign up too. After all, communities aren’t built by a few
dedicated giants towering over the others – they’re built by continual efforts
by many, many decent and hardworking people.</p><div>
</div><p>  So please take a few minutes to check us out at <a href=""http://www.bobblejob.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>www.bobblejob.com</u></a> and pop in your details.
It’ll only take a few seconds, and it’ll let you see what’s happening
as jobs start appearing in your area. Then post up a job or two, and volunteer
or bid on anything that takes your fancy.</p><div>

  Oh, and there’s a good chance that you’ll be
able to clear up some of those odd-jobs that have been sitting around for ages
along the way – and that you’ll make a little money to stick in your pocket. </div><div>Please like and share our facebook page - </div><p></p><p><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Bobblejob.UnitedKingdom"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/Bobblejob.UnitedKingdom</a></p><div>

</div><div>
<br/>
</div><div>Q: Does Bobblejob include the facility for ratings, messaging, reviews and so on?</div><div>A: Yes, Bobblejob has a full suite of extra support services. The full suite of services will be settled out better once we introduce the additional account heirachies.<br/><br/>Q: I'm worried about my privacy.  Is my information safe on Bobblejob?</div><p>A: First
and foremost, we can assure you that your address and contact details are only
ever shared when you request a friend to verify your details. They are never
shared as a part of the job posting or bidding process. Only an approximate
distance and town are given on a job.  We
do not sell nor rent data to anyone.</p><div>
<br/>Q: Do I have to accept the lowest bidder for a job? What if they have a bad rating?</div><div>A: No, you don’t. You get to check through the bids, check the profiles of the bidders, their reviews, the number of verifications they have and who has verified them, and so on. You can ask additional questions, and then, when you’re happy with a particular offer you get to choose that one.</div><div>
<br/>Q: Can I accept more than one bid for a bigger job?</div><div>A: Absolutely! You are free to accept as many bids as you would like for each job.<br/><br/>
</div><div>Q: Is Bobblejob UK only, or do you operate in other countries?</div><div>A: Bobblejob is built to work internationally - the tech is all in place. It's only that we currently lack the resources necessary to make sure that we operate legally elsewhere. Who knows, if we manage to attract enough funding, maybe we'll hire an international representative and open Bobblejob in a different country sooner than expected!</div><div>
<br/>Q: What if there’s a problem? What if the work isn’t done well enough or the job poster doesn’t pay?</div><div>A: We weren’t there. We don’t know what really happened. The best we can do is give both sides the chance to tell their sides of the story. If you go to the job page, you will find the option to raise a dispute.</div><div>
<br/>Q: I'm uncertain about letting a stranger into my house, or going somewhere else to work. What assurances can you give me?</div><div>A: The vast majority of people are decent, and if you accept a bid from someone with a decent work history and rating then you can be fairly sure that they will at least do their best - just as you can be fairly sure that someone with a good ebay rating is unlikely to take your money and not supply you with your goods. Any time you let anyone work for you, whether an odd-jobber or a registered plumber then there is, of course, the risk that they aren't who they claim to be - it only takes hours these days with cheap printing companies, scanners, online copies of certifications and all the rest to set yourself up as a false tradesman - which is why sites like check-a-trade exist for professional builders. <br/>  We have a verification system where people can ask people they know to confirm that they have a genuine address and email registered. We'll be introducing a confirmation-by-mobile system that would, if there was trouble, allow tracing of the culprit by law enforcement authorities, and we'll be making it clear which users had confirmed their identity in this way in their profiles. We also have a recommended practice at <a href=""http://www.bobblejob.com/en-gb/help"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>http://www.bobblejob.com/en-gb/help</u></a> as well - it's mostly common sense, things like making sure that someone else you know knows that someone is coming round or where you're going for a job and so on. Read through and feel free to ask any other questions if you're worried.<br/>

  Now there’s a way to make our communities a little brighter, our neighbourhoods a little better, get all those annoying odd-jobs and things you’ve been putting off done, or make a little money doing them for others yourself!  Bobblejob - www.bobblejob.com – is named after the old practice of “Bob-a-job”, a small coin reward for a small job done. It is a community-based odd-job introduction website that lets people post up their work that needs

  What makes Bobblejob different is that we turn the usual way

Bobblejob is a convenient place to come and find jobs to do.

one of your own.https://www.facebook.com/Bobblejob.UnitedKingdomhttps://twitter.com/Bobblejob_GB



   About Bobblejob, and What We Want 
  We want people to get to know their neighbours and their
wider community better, by revolutionising the way people find help to do their
odd jobs, and allowing people with skills and time to spare to earn extra cash.
Just got back from holiday with two suitcases of washing? Let someone else iron!  What do you do if you need someone to help you with any of the kinds of chores or problems that happen to us all?  For example:
do a solid spring clean
help set up your wireless LAN
rake up and burn an autumn’s worth of fallen leaves
putting together a flat-pack bookshelf
  Or perhaps you have a more obscure job, or something very small that isn't worth a professional for a day, such as:
compose a poem for your wedding day
help you carry a sofa down the stairs
DJ at a birthday party
teach you how to make best use of your new mobile phone


… or any other odd-job task you
might want done but don’t have either the time, the skill or the desire to do
yourself.

             



  Everyone can do with a little extra cash, and for some of us
it can make all the difference - single parents, students, those on low incomes
and semi-retired and retired people. People have free time or unused skills,
and often want to do something worthwhile with them. You might just want to

  The third and in some ways the most important impact is what Bobblejob can
do for the local community. We
believe Bobblejob will foster a community spirit and a sense of people in the
neighbourhood helping each other to get things done. This is especially true for schools,
churches or local charities. We also have the ability to handle charity and
unpaid work - for example, a school could post a job looking for a dozen people
to help with the school fair, or a charity could recruit people to act as
marshals for a sponsored event. In addition, we have a innovative schools system
coming shortly, in which older students looking for work experience can be part
of a group together with the school parents, staff and administrators. For
security, those students use reduced authority accounts which only allows them
to see jobs posted by the school community once they log in. The school
admins have the ability to oversee everything.  A student with a record of two
dozen jobs done and an average four-and-a-half star rating has a better
chance of being accepted for any application, whether university or their
first job, than someone with no work background at all.  This is basically a mini-Bobblejob setup, a
micro-site. We have
planned to add a “graduation” display or printable
“CV” of jobs done, rewards earned and ratings given for students who leave the
school. Parents, of course, have full Bobblejob accounts and
can see or post jobs outside the school environment if they wish.   A similar, but less restrictive university system should go live
during this Indiegogo campaign, if it hasn’t already when you read this. We’ll expand it to a
general groups system later, so anyone could set up their own private groups
(e.g. babysitting groups) if they wish.
Not everyone likes flat-pack furniture assembly instructions...    Risks & Challenges  
  Making Bobblejob a success is not a trivial task. We’re
convinced that we’ve got a good concept, but for it to become a self-sustaining
operation we need to have plenty of members posting plenty of jobs so others
locally in their communities can bid on them and do them. If the nearest jobs
are a hundred miles away then it’s too far to get involved. In some ways we’re
like an early version of ebay or any other auction site – you have to have
enough content to bring people in to see what’s there, and enough people coming
in and bidding to make it worth putting content on. We're like a car that needs its engine
to “turn over” enough to fire – once we’re running then we believe that we can
continue to thrive.
The Future
  Further developments to the site should include:
  Enhanced School, University and Group accounts (as
mentioned)
  Phone apps  Enhanced accounts. Bobblejob is free to use, but there will be two levels of
subscription based enhanced accounts. The silver accounts will provide in-app
messaging and the ability to pay each other electronically (via Paypal), and
they’ll have priority in searches. This will be a minimal monthly cost. The
gold accounts will cost slightly more and are intended for more serious
handymen – they’ll be provided a minisite of their own to advertise their
skills and work history, plus post up any document scans of certifications or
qualifications such as safety certificates or background checks, plus they’ll
be searchable by work type and area.



And, of course, there's the old favourite of cutting the grass...

   Other Ways You Can Help 

  This is an Indiegogo project request, so of course we’re
asking for money – but money isn’t really all we’re asking for. We’re after
people who will join us in working to make our communities brighter and
cleaner, to repair what’s broken and look after those who need help. We’re
after people who will help charities in their work. We’re after those who have
work they need done and projects they want help with.
  In short, we’re after members.
We’re after people who will sign up and use Bobblejob the way it’s meant to be
used; people who will convince their friends, their families and their clients
and suppliers to sign up too. After all, communities aren’t built by a few
dedicated giants towering over the others – they’re built by continual efforts
by many, many decent and hardworking people.
  So please take a few minutes to check us out at www.bobblejob.com and pop in your details.
It’ll only take a few seconds, and it’ll let you see what’s happening
as jobs start appearing in your area. Then post up a job or two, and volunteer
or bid on anything that takes your fancy.

  Oh, and there’s a good chance that you’ll be
able to clear up some of those odd-jobs that have been sitting around for ages
along the way – and that you’ll make a little money to stick in your pocket. Please like and share our facebook page - https://www.facebook.com/Bobblejob.UnitedKingdom
Take a look at Twitter too -https://twitter.com/Bobblejob_GBand, as always, use the Indiegogo share tools as well! And if you like the idea, let others know about it!
Some Questions and Answers
All the following questions are answered in much more detail at http://www.bobblejob.com/en-gb/help . Check there if you want to know more,


Q: Does Bobblejob include the facility for ratings, messaging, reviews and so on?A: Yes, Bobblejob has a full suite of extra support services. The full suite of services will be settled out better once we introduce the additional account heirachies.Q: I'm worried about my privacy.  Is my information safe on Bobblejob?A: First
and foremost, we can assure you that your address and contact details are only
ever shared when you request a friend to verify your details. They are never
shared as a part of the job posting or bidding process. Only an approximate
distance and town are given on a job.  We
do not sell nor rent data to anyone.
Q: Do I have to accept the lowest bidder for a job? What if they have a bad rating?A: No, you don’t. You get to check through the bids, check the profiles of the bidders, their reviews, the number of verifications they have and who has verified them, and so on. You can ask additional questions, and then, when you’re happy with a particular offer you get to choose that one.
Q: Can I accept more than one bid for a bigger job?A: Absolutely! You are free to accept as many bids as you would like for each job.
Q: Is Bobblejob UK only, or do you operate in other countries?A: Bobblejob is built to work internationally - the tech is all in place. It's only that we currently lack the resources necessary to make sure that we operate legally elsewhere. Who knows, if we manage to attract enough funding, maybe we'll hire an international representative and open Bobblejob in a different country sooner than expected!
Q: What if there’s a problem? What if the work isn’t done well enough or the job poster doesn’t pay?A: We weren’t there. We don’t know what really happened. The best we can do is give both sides the chance to tell their sides of the story. If you go to the job page, you will find the option to raise a dispute.
Q: I'm uncertain about letting a stranger into my house, or going somewhere else to work. What assurances can you give me?A: The vast majority of people are decent, and if you accept a bid from someone with a decent work history and rating then you can be fairly sure that they will at least do their best - just as you can be fairly sure that someone with a good ebay rating is unlikely to take your money and not supply you with your goods. Any time you let anyone work for you, whether an odd-jobber or a registered plumber then there is, of course, the risk that they aren't who they claim to be - it only takes hours these days with cheap printing companies, scanners, online copies of certifications and all the rest to set yourself up as a false tradesman - which is why sites like check-a-trade exist for professional builders.   We have a verification system where people can ask people they know to confirm that they have a genuine address and email registered. We'll be introducing a confirmation-by-mobile system that would, if there was trouble, allow tracing of the culprit by law enforcement authorities, and we'll be making it clear which users had confirmed their identity in this way in their profiles. We also have a recommended practice at http://www.bobblejob.com/en-gb/help as well - it's mostly common sense, things like making sure that someone else you know knows that someone is coming round or where you're going for a job and so on. Read through and feel free to ask any other questions if you're worried.",9.0,0,"1 Campaign

Beekeepers, entomologists, and crop advisors will trade places with a corn

beekeeping operation. We need to raise an additional $160,000 to take this show
on the road and bring job swaps to soybean farmers, almond growers, and other
vegetable and fruit growers. We also need to involve beekeepers from
California, Idaho, Florida, and all around the country, not to mention more
entomologists, conservationists, regulators, and even members of the general
public like you.</p>
<p>This Indiegogo

 in front and a single rear. Unlike some 2-1 three-wheelers, however, 
the Spyder does not lean. The Spyder’s mix-mash hybrid of motorcycle and
 ATV technology is perhaps most evident in the Can-Am Spyder chassis - 
dual A-arms complementing a single rear shock. The Can-Am Spyder frame 
is a Y-shaped cradle surrounding the Spyder’s 990cc V-Twin – the 
liquid-cooled engine built by Austria’s Rotax and a variation of the 
Twins powering Aprilia sportbikes. Features like stability and traction 
control, as well as power steering keep the Spyder manageable on the 
road. <br/>“I really feel we are building an industry which will become bigger and 
bigger and bigger,” said BRP CEO Jose Boisjoli while addressing 
journalists gathered for the press launch of the 2013 <a href=""http://www.motorcycle-usa.com/475/Motorcycles/Can-Am-Motorcycles.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Can-Am</a> Spyder. <br/>
<br/>
Boisjoli’s statement is supported by the release of a new model this year, a sport-touring version called the 2013 <u>Can-Am</u>
 Spyder ST. The new addition expands the Spyder range to three base 
models with “R” and “Limited” variations of those base models offered as
 well, demonstrating the importance of the <u>Spyder</u>
 to Can-Am’s road vehicle aspirations, the unique three-wheeled Roadster
 hitting the scene in 2008. And after seeing over 30% growth in sales in
 its <u>first</u>
 four years in existence, there is no resting on laurels in this 
industry, a factor which helped drive changes to the chassis and <u>suspension</u> on this year’s Spyder as the vehicle continues to evolve. <br/><br/>
<u>Can-Am</u>
 is good at keeping a secret. In the days of intentional leaks, supposed
 spy shots, and viral campaigns that trickle out information one spec at
 a time, <a href=""http://www.motorcycle-usa.com/441/Motorcycles/Can-am-Spyder.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Can-Am</a> <u>surprised</u> the group of journalists gathered for the press launch of the 2014 Spyder when it announced it had built a new <u>Inline</u>
 Triple engine to power its 2014 RT models. This is even more impressive
 considering the 1330cc Inline three-cylinder has been three years in 
the making. Made by the same company that builds its 998cc V-Twin, the 
engine is dubbed the Rotax 1330 ACE (Advanced Combustion Efficiency), 
and a variation of the ACE was <u>first</u>
 launched by parent company BRP in a snowmobile. The Rotax 1330 ACE was 
built exclusively for the Spyder though, and there it was before us, 
sitting low and forward in a stripped-down <u>Spyder</u>
 frame for all to see at the launch, transversally mounted and mated to a
 new six-speed gearbox to boot. Yep, these Can-Am guys are full of 
secrets. <br/><br/><b>Fahrbericht von DIE WELT</b><br/><p>Manche <u>Vehikel</u> haben mit Vorurteilen zu kämpfen. Zum Beispiel motorisierte Dreiräder. Je nach Hersteller haben sie <u>zwei</u> Räder an Vorder- oder Hinterachse und sind somit ein Mittelding aus Auto
 und Bike. Der kanadische Bombardier-Konzern, hervorgegangen 1942 aus 
dem Bau von Schneemobilen, setzt seit 2008 auf die ganz eigene 
Dreirad-Dynamik. Seine Can-Am Spyder <u>haben</u>
 dank breiter Vorderachse jede Menge Grip, hinten treibt ein 225er 
Autoreifen das Dreirad an. Nach betont sportlichen und reisetauglichen 
Modellen soll ab sofort der Can-Am Spyder F3 die Freunde von Cruisern 
bedienen. Die entspannte Sitzposition mit leicht <u>nach</u>
 vorne gebeugtem Oberkörper und fast ausgestreckten Armen und Beinen 
lässt sich vielfach auf unterschiedliche Körpergrößen einstellen. <br/></p><p>Cruiser-Fans soll der F3 mit hoher Fahrdynamik und Sicherheit 
überzeugen, die <br/>
Rechts ein Gasgriff am Lenker, links die Tasten einer Halbautomatik zum 
Rauf- und Runterschalten. An der linken Fußraste nichts, rechts ein 
Bremspedal. So bedient man die Mischung aus leistungsstarkem Roadster
 á la Porsche Boxster und hyperagilem Supermoto-Zweirad. Der Pilot eines
 Can-Am Spyder F3 hängt mit ganzem Körper im Fahrtwind, freut sich dank 
breiter Vorderachse über reichlich Grip vorn und berechenbare Drifts mit
 leicht durchdrehendem Antriebsrad hinten – jedoch immer nur so weit, 
wie es die Sicherheitssysteme von Bosch zulassen. Das 
Stabilitätskontrollsystem SCS arbeitet wie ESP beim Auto, das 
Traktionskontrollsystem TCS verhindert Leistungseinsatz oberhalb der 
übertragbaren Antriebskräfte, ABS beugt Bremsblockaden vor. Das Fenster 
bis zum Einsatz der Systeme erlaubt leichte Driftwinkel, die die 
möglichen hohen Kurventempi mit einem großen Schuss Fahrspaß würzen.</p><p><br/>
Wer keinen Motorrad-Führerschein hat, <u>oder</u> sich nicht mehr
 auf die Schräglagen eines Zweirads einlassen möchte, kann sich durchaus
 auf eine Testfahrt mit einem Motor-Dreirad wie den Can-Am Spyder 
einlassen. Zum Fahren genügt in Deutschland
 ein Autoführerschein von vor dem 19. Januar 2013. Ein überzeugter Biker
 wird hier immer die Schräglage eines Motorrads vermissen, ebenso die 
Möglichkeit des Schlängelns durch Engstellen oder des problemlosen 
Parkens. Aber: Die extreme Fahrdynamik macht Spaß, die 
Sicherheitsreserven <u>sind</u>
 groß, Stauraum ist auch vorhanden. Und Beifahrer findet man fürs 
kippsichere Dreirad leichter, als für so manchen heißen Ofen mit nur 
zwei Rädern.</p><p><br/>
Für flotten Vortrieb sorgt beim Spyder F3 der 1,3-Liter-Dreizylinder von
 Bombardiers Konzerntochter Rotax. Der Reihen-Triple verwöhnt mit dem 
kräftigen Durchzug von immerhin 130 Nm Drehmoment, 86 kW/115 PS Leistung
 und dem charakteristischen Dreizylinder-Sound, den Fans zum Beispiel 
auch an einer Triumph Speed Triple schätzen. In nur 4,8 s katapultiert 
der Rotax-Antrieb das trocken 386 kg schwere Dreirad auf hundert km/h – das ist zwar um gut eineinhalb Sekunden langsamer als besagtes Triumph-Zweirad, aber immerhin exakt so schnell wie ein aktueller Porsche 911 Carrera.</p><p><br/>
Die Auswahl zwischen sechs Gängen erfolgt wahlweise manuell oder 
halbautomatisch. Gerade beim Cruiser F3 empfiehlt sich die 
Semi-Automatik, die beim Wechseln in niedrigere Gänge von selbst 
Zwischengas gibt und beim Hochschalten unter Last keine wesentliche 
Zugkraftunterbrechung spüren lässt. Fürs Fahrverhalten seines neuen F3 
hat Can-Am die Erfahrungen mit seinen bisherigen Spyder-Modellen RS 
(Sportler), RT (Tourer) und ST (Tourensportler) einfließen lassen. Das Chassis
 ist um 40 Prozent steifer geworden, und dank der neuen Sitzposition mit
 nahezu gestreckten Beinen kann der Pilot stärker als bisher mit den 
Oberschenkeln lenken und so die Arme entlasten. Die müssen wegen der 
hohen Kurventempi und trotz dynamischer Servolenkung ganz schön Kraft 
aufwenden. Die Fahrtechnik mit ausgestrecktem kurvenäußerem Arm 
erleichtert mit der Zeit den heißen Kurvenritt mit dem Spyder F3, wie 
unsere ersten Testfahrten auf Mallorca gezeigt haben – unter anderem auf
 der extrem kurvigen Passstraße Coll de Sóller.</p><p><br/>
Drei Ausstattungspakete sollen unterschiedliche Fahrertypen bedienen. 
Dank des sogenannten UFIT-Systems lassen sich die Dreirad-Cruiser auf 
Körpergrößen zwischen 1,56 und 1,86 m optimal einstellen. Und selbst mit zwei
 Metern Länge hat man bequem Platz auf dem rasanten Spyder F3. Den 
Coolness-Faktor möchte Can-Am noch mit Kleidungs-Kollektionen 
unterstützen, was im Hinblick auf die meist männliche, über 40jährige 
Kundschaft auch gelingen kann – zumindest im Falle von nicht-Bikern.<br/>

 in front and a single rear. Unlike some 2-1 three-wheelers, however, 
the Spyder does not lean. The Spyder’s mix-mash hybrid of motorcycle and
 ATV technology is perhaps most evident in the Can-Am Spyder chassis - 
dual A-arms complementing a single rear shock. The Can-Am Spyder frame 
is a Y-shaped cradle surrounding the Spyder’s 990cc V-Twin – the 
liquid-cooled engine built by Austria’s Rotax and a variation of the 
Twins powering Aprilia sportbikes. Features like stability and traction 
control, as well as power steering keep the Spyder manageable on the 
road. “I really feel we are building an industry which will become bigger and 
bigger and bigger,” said BRP CEO Jose Boisjoli while addressing 
journalists gathered for the press launch of the 2013 Can-Am Spyder. 

Boisjoli’s statement is supported by the release of a new model this year, a sport-touring version called the 2013 Can-Am
 Spyder ST. The new addition expands the Spyder range to three base 
models with “R” and “Limited” variations of those base models offered as
 well, demonstrating the importance of the Spyder
 to Can-Am’s road vehicle aspirations, the unique three-wheeled Roadster
 hitting the scene in 2008. And after seeing over 30% growth in sales in
 its first
 four years in existence, there is no resting on laurels in this 
industry, a factor which helped drive changes to the chassis and suspension on this year’s Spyder as the vehicle continues to evolve. 
Can-Am
 is good at keeping a secret. In the days of intentional leaks, supposed
 spy shots, and viral campaigns that trickle out information one spec at
 a time, Can-Am surprised the group of journalists gathered for the press launch of the 2014 Spyder when it announced it had built a new Inline
 Triple engine to power its 2014 RT models. This is even more impressive
 considering the 1330cc Inline three-cylinder has been three years in 
the making. Made by the same company that builds its 998cc V-Twin, the 
engine is dubbed the Rotax 1330 ACE (Advanced Combustion Efficiency), 
and a variation of the ACE was first
 launched by parent company BRP in a snowmobile. The Rotax 1330 ACE was 
built exclusively for the Spyder though, and there it was before us, 
sitting low and forward in a stripped-down Spyder
 frame for all to see at the launch, transversally mounted and mated to a
 new six-speed gearbox to boot. Yep, these Can-Am guys are full of 
secrets. Fahrbericht von DIE WELTManche Vehikel haben mit Vorurteilen zu kämpfen. Zum Beispiel motorisierte Dreiräder. Je nach Hersteller haben sie zwei Räder an Vorder- oder Hinterachse und sind somit ein Mittelding aus Auto
 und Bike. Der kanadische Bombardier-Konzern, hervorgegangen 1942 aus 
dem Bau von Schneemobilen, setzt seit 2008 auf die ganz eigene 
Dreirad-Dynamik. Seine Can-Am Spyder haben
 dank breiter Vorderachse jede Menge Grip, hinten treibt ein 225er 
Autoreifen das Dreirad an. Nach betont sportlichen und reisetauglichen 
Modellen soll ab sofort der Can-Am Spyder F3 die Freunde von Cruisern 
bedienen. Die entspannte Sitzposition mit leicht nach
 vorne gebeugtem Oberkörper und fast ausgestreckten Armen und Beinen 
lässt sich vielfach auf unterschiedliche Körpergrößen einstellen. Cruiser-Fans soll der F3 mit hoher Fahrdynamik und Sicherheit 
überzeugen, die 
Rechts ein Gasgriff am Lenker, links die Tasten einer Halbautomatik zum 
Rauf- und Runterschalten. An der linken Fußraste nichts, rechts ein 
Bremspedal. So bedient man die Mischung aus leistungsstarkem Roadster
 á la Porsche Boxster und hyperagilem Supermoto-Zweirad. Der Pilot eines
 Can-Am Spyder F3 hängt mit ganzem Körper im Fahrtwind, freut sich dank 
breiter Vorderachse über reichlich Grip vorn und berechenbare Drifts mit
 leicht durchdrehendem Antriebsrad hinten – jedoch immer nur so weit, 
wie es die Sicherheitssysteme von Bosch zulassen. Das 
Stabilitätskontrollsystem SCS arbeitet wie ESP beim Auto, das 
Traktionskontrollsystem TCS verhindert Leistungseinsatz oberhalb der 
übertragbaren Antriebskräfte, ABS beugt Bremsblockaden vor. Das Fenster 
bis zum Einsatz der Systeme erlaubt leichte Driftwinkel, die die 
möglichen hohen Kurventempi mit einem großen Schuss Fahrspaß würzen.
Wer keinen Motorrad-Führerschein hat, oder sich nicht mehr
 auf die Schräglagen eines Zweirads einlassen möchte, kann sich durchaus
 auf eine Testfahrt mit einem Motor-Dreirad wie den Can-Am Spyder 
einlassen. Zum Fahren genügt in Deutschland
 ein Autoführerschein von vor dem 19. Januar 2013. Ein überzeugter Biker
 wird hier immer die Schräglage eines Motorrads vermissen, ebenso die 
Möglichkeit des Schlängelns durch Engstellen oder des problemlosen 
Parkens. Aber: Die extreme Fahrdynamik macht Spaß, die 
Sicherheitsreserven sind
 groß, Stauraum ist auch vorhanden. Und Beifahrer findet man fürs 
kippsichere Dreirad leichter, als für so manchen heißen Ofen mit nur 
zwei Rädern.
Für flotten Vortrieb sorgt beim Spyder F3 der 1,3-Liter-Dreizylinder von
 Bombardiers Konzerntochter Rotax. Der Reihen-Triple verwöhnt mit dem 
kräftigen Durchzug von immerhin 130 Nm Drehmoment, 86 kW/115 PS Leistung
 und dem charakteristischen Dreizylinder-Sound, den Fans zum Beispiel 
auch an einer Triumph Speed Triple schätzen. In nur 4,8 s katapultiert 
der Rotax-Antrieb das trocken 386 kg schwere Dreirad auf hundert km/h – das ist zwar um gut eineinhalb Sekunden langsamer als besagtes Triumph-Zweirad, aber immerhin exakt so schnell wie ein aktueller Porsche 911 Carrera.
Die Auswahl zwischen sechs Gängen erfolgt wahlweise manuell oder 
halbautomatisch. Gerade beim Cruiser F3 empfiehlt sich die 
Semi-Automatik, die beim Wechseln in niedrigere Gänge von selbst 
Zwischengas gibt und beim Hochschalten unter Last keine wesentliche 
Zugkraftunterbrechung spüren lässt. Fürs Fahrverhalten seines neuen F3 
hat Can-Am die Erfahrungen mit seinen bisherigen Spyder-Modellen RS 
(Sportler), RT (Tourer) und ST (Tourensportler) einfließen lassen. Das Chassis
 ist um 40 Prozent steifer geworden, und dank der neuen Sitzposition mit
 nahezu gestreckten Beinen kann der Pilot stärker als bisher mit den 
Oberschenkeln lenken und so die Arme entlasten. Die müssen wegen der 
hohen Kurventempi und trotz dynamischer Servolenkung ganz schön Kraft 
aufwenden. Die Fahrtechnik mit ausgestrecktem kurvenäußerem Arm 
erleichtert mit der Zeit den heißen Kurvenritt mit dem Spyder F3, wie 
unsere ersten Testfahrten auf Mallorca gezeigt haben – unter anderem auf
 der extrem kurvigen Passstraße Coll de Sóller.
Drei Ausstattungspakete sollen unterschiedliche Fahrertypen bedienen. 
Dank des sogenannten UFIT-Systems lassen sich die Dreirad-Cruiser auf 
Körpergrößen zwischen 1,56 und 1,86 m optimal einstellen. Und selbst mit zwei
 Metern Länge hat man bequem Platz auf dem rasanten Spyder F3. Den 
Coolness-Faktor möchte Can-Am noch mit Kleidungs-Kollektionen 
unterstützen, was im Hinblick auf die meist männliche, über 40jährige 
Kundschaft auch gelingen kann – zumindest im Falle von nicht-Bikern.

 After restoring  PBR 6927, a Vietnam War era US Navy River Patrol Boat,
several years ago and having used it in various historical, educational and veteran appreciation functions, we'd like to fulfill a dream of many of the veterans that we have interacted with. As these boats generally operated in two boat patrols, it has been a desire of many former crew members to experience a pair of these boats operating in tandem once again. Both myself and Dennis Ambruso, owner of PBR 721have worked together to help crew each other's boats for functions that honor service and educate the public about these little known branches of the US Navy and US Army in Vietnam.  In spite of our best efforts, we have never achieved the goal of fulfilling that two boat patrol dream. Distance and financial constraints have always held us back. PBR 6927 is located in eastern Ohio, and PBR 721 is located in north eastern North Carolina.
 After Dennis relocated to the Elizabeth City North Carolina area, at the prodding of former Vietnam Riverine Sailor Clarence ""Coop"" Cooper,

This was the name given to the US Navy's Task Force 116, which was tasked with patrolling the vast inland waterways of Vietnam, to deny the enemy the use of waterborne transportation of men and materials.

I had planned to work on this proposal on this very day, which turned out to be the 40th anniversary of the fall of Saigon.  The memories of those newscasts and images came flooding back to the point that I had to pull over and collect my thoughts.

    Challenges and Qualifications Although we feel that this is a worthy goal for a worthwhile cause, we hope that you will also share our dream in achieving this milestone. The Vietnam veterans that I have interacted with are a private lot, they weren't shown much support upon their return and don't expect much. They are a quiet group that doesn't ask for much. Most would rather put forth efforts to insure that future generations of returning veterans are given their due honor. Help us to give them the welcome home that they deserve by providing this Living History honorarium for them and current and future Riverine Sailors. 
Collectively David Pizzoferrato and Dennis Ambruso have over 80 years of military vehicle restoration and preservation experience. Dennis has many years of experience and contacts within the military museum circles. He is also a founding member of The Military Museum of Southern New England in Danbury CT. David is a co-owner operator of a military vehicle restoration canvas business and has had prior experience in various team oriented management capacities in heavy and building construction trades in both public and private sector settings. The balance of our team and advisers will consist of passionate veterans with valuable hands on input.
Our team is uniquely qualified and shares a burning passion for seeing this project through.
In order to more fully appreciate and understand the challenges faced by those who manned and maintained these boats on a daily basis, here is an informative video that details the history of the Brown Water, Small Boat Navy in Vietnam

He recently fought a battle with Diabetes that almost took his life but he still has so much more to give the world. Without surgery Tommy will go blind within a year- maybe less.  Each surgery is $ 4,000 per eye.

10% of funds raised are IMMEDIATELY donated to help our friend and renowned artist Tommy Castillo, a phenomenal artist who created Dark Side of Oz and worked on Toetags with George Romero, Tales from the Crypt and so much more. He recently fought a battle with Diabetes that almost took his life but he still has so much more to give the world. Without surgery Tommy will go blind within a year- maybe less.  Each surgery is $ 4,000 per eye. The doctor noted that he will need AT LEAST two treatments in each eye plus prescriptions and recovery time. Your pledge will support two causes - our event, and more importantly, Tommy's sight.

    Other Ways You Can Help We understand that not everyone can donate, but that doesn't mean you can't help.  Just by sharing this page means a lot. If you love conventions in general, just share it and pass it on.FOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK!FOLLOW US ON INSTAGRAM!FOLLOW US ON TWITTER!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>We are a hybrid social entrepreneurship incubator (think of people who start companies and programs to help social causes) and research institute focused on helping develop social enterprises and connecting the fields of youth development, inter-generational development, youth development hubs, and economic development.  </p>
<p>We are committed to helping addressing the social and economic issues coming from a lack of access to social and monetary capital, leadership in crucial roles for young adults, lack of connections between business, educational, and social institutions in communities, and economic development.  We are a sustainable social center that serves as the central hub in a network of programs, initiatives, and research focusing on youth, community, and economic development.  </p>
<p>Our main work and expertise focuses on: </p>
<ul>
<li><p><i><b>Program Evaluation:</b></i> We perform all types of evaluation, including full evidence based evaluations utilizing analytical tools such as surveys, focus groups, rapid assessment procedures, etc.</p></li>
<li><p><i><b>Social Enterprise Incubator:</b></i> Our signature program helps programs grow their way from an initial start up to full evidence based practice.  To date we have already partnered with Pittsburgh and Detroit to develop this model by serving as the social incubator providing technical support, research, and evaluation to help these programs grow. </p></li>
<li><p><b><i>Research, Policy, and Trend Analysis:</i></b> Researching and disseminating new information on growing global needs and trends in human capital and economic development, such as the connection between India’s youth bulge and the Japanese need for human resources</p></li>

the issues connecting youth, community, and economic development. 
 Recently, this work took him to Spain to document the issues facing 
the Spanish economy and its relationship to the high rates of 
unemployment for people in Spain under the age of 26.  As an additional 
part of this research, he conducted interviews with youth living in the 
Catalan region of Spain to understand the link between human capital, 
economics, and the political agenda for the movement for independence in
 Catalonia.</span></p>

 in both quantitative and qualitative methods of research and 
evaluation, Will is currently spearheading a multi-year developmental 
evaluation study of the Youth Communities and Schools Together (Youth 
C.A.S.T.) program in McKeesport Pennsylvania.  The research will be used
 to focus on the development of the Youth Development Hub Model in 
McKeesport Pennsylvania.  The end result will be an evidence-based model

</div></div>","MEET US
We are a hybrid social entrepreneurship incubator (think of people who start companies and programs to help social causes) and research institute focused on helping develop social enterprises and connecting the fields of youth development, inter-generational development, youth development hubs, and economic development.  
We are committed to helping addressing the social and economic issues coming from a lack of access to social and monetary capital, leadership in crucial roles for young adults, lack of connections between business, educational, and social institutions in communities, and economic development.  We are a sustainable social center that serves as the central hub in a network of programs, initiatives, and research focusing on youth, community, and economic development.  
Our main work and expertise focuses on: 

Program Evaluation: We perform all types of evaluation, including full evidence based evaluations utilizing analytical tools such as surveys, focus groups, rapid assessment procedures, etc.
Social Enterprise Incubator: Our signature program helps programs grow their way from an initial start up to full evidence based practice.  To date we have already partnered with Pittsburgh and Detroit to develop this model by serving as the social incubator providing technical support, research, and evaluation to help these programs grow. 
Research, Policy, and Trend Analysis: Researching and disseminating new information on growing global needs and trends in human capital and economic development, such as the connection between India’s youth bulge and the Japanese need for human resources

WHY WE NEED YOU
Our colleague
 Research Associate Will Greenaway was recently admitted into the summer
 program at the London School of Economics-- one of the premier 
institutions for economics in the world.  The school only has a 7.2 
percent acceptance rate. 
We use economic analysis daily to ensure our Youth Development
 Hubs have a positive economic impact on the communities we work with.  We
 will use Will's training to assess the economic impact of our program partner, Youth CAST, in McKeesport, Pennsylvania.  
You can help by contributing.

skills with my passion for DIY and created the Car-Li Bagg.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>I
came up with the idea after I got fed up with my teen aged son (who suffers
from allergies) constantly littering my car with soiled tissues, food wrappers,
partially eaten food, and other trash.  I started using a grocery bag
attached to the gearshift.  When it filled up, it was unsightly,

<p>
</p>
<p><b><i>Totally frustrated, I
thought,  I'll just buy a car trash bag.  Easier said than
done.  The ones I found were not designed for front seat occupants.
 Others weren't designed to hold enough car litter to make it useful to
me.  Still others were made of fabric that absorbed stains and
odor.  To solve my problem, I set out to make
my own car trash bag.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>First, I wanted it to be conveniently accessible to both front AND back seat
occupants.  Second, I wanted comfort.  The side strap fits around the front passenger seat and molds
comfortably into the seat as the passenger reclines.  Then I designed the pouch to be big enough <strong><em> (9"" L x 5"" w x 8.5"" deep)</em></strong> to hold a fair amount of litter, yet small
enough not to get in the way. Interior vinyl lining was
added for spills.  And, since the bag is shoulder level, I wanted
pouch freshness, so I attached an interior pocket for a scented insert. 
The pleasant scent can linger outside the pouch as well.  It's the car litter
bag that makes SCents!</i></b></p>

thought,  I'll just buy a car trash bag.  Easier said than
done.  The ones I found were not designed for front seat occupants.
 Others weren't designed to hold enough car litter to make it useful to
me.  Still others were made of fabric that absorbed stains and
odor.  To solve my problem, I set out to make
my own car trash bag.
First, I wanted it to be conveniently accessible to both front AND back seat
occupants.  Second, I wanted comfort.  The side strap fits around the front passenger seat and molds
comfortably into the seat as the passenger reclines.  Then I designed the pouch to be big enough  (9"" L x 5"" w x 8.5"" deep) to hold a fair amount of litter, yet small
enough not to get in the way. Interior vinyl lining was
added for spills.  And, since the bag is shoulder level, I wanted
pouch freshness, so I attached an interior pocket for a scented insert. 
The pleasant scent can linger outside the pouch as well.  It's the car litter
bag that makes SCents!









Simple.  Thoughtful. 
And it works!
A by-product of
using The Car-Li Bagg  - it helps us be more environmentally
conscious.  With the convenience of The Car-Li Bagg in the car,  the
normal tendency will be to use the bag, instead of discarding litter out
the window.  
Your T-Shirt promotes an environmental
message. It will bear a ""small
"" oval image  depicting The Bagg nestled among lush greenery with
the caption: 



BE KIND TO YOUR
ENVIRONMENT 
Put  litter in its place with THE CAR-LI BAGG   











The Car-Li Bagg is
great for parents with small children, for those who use their car as an
office, and for those who just want a clutter free car.  And  for those of you who have been using that cereal box for car litter (and you know who you are), you can start using The Car-Li Bagg instead!









The car trash bag
category is a sleeping GIANT within the $216 Billion auto accessories
industry.  I believe I can bring  awareness and fill a need in this space at this critical
time.  The Car-Li Bagg,  making life a little less cluttered for the
car driving public with a uniquely comfortable, convenient, and
economical way to deal with nuisance car litter.   











I've journeyed several months
 balancing  my other ""Life"" with this  vision
.  With your help, I can get a
solid start on getting proof of concept sales, branding The Car-Li Bagg name and
making it a household name in the auto accessories space. 



When you invest in me, you're investing in my background as a professional who understands  the value of good customer service and doing what I say I'm going to do.   I'm committed to finalizing my patent process, continuing to improve my product and taking The Car-Li Bagg to the next level.  No contribution is too small.  Thank you for your help!
Next Steps:  
1)Trademark  The Car-Li Bagg name 
2)Purchase raw material, supplies, and labor for perk fulfillment and proof of concept of sales [of which I already have several  pending purchase orders].
3)Create and Optimize a dedicated website for consumer awareness.






RISKS
AND CHALLENGES:




I have a wonderful and accomplished seamstress
(Judy Hardister) working with me on the product.   If fabric goes out of stock, we may ask to
substitute an order.  However, I always try to avail myself of fabrics that
are “re-orderable” which is part of my customer service strategy.
Scaling the product depends on the outcome of my campaign and ultimate demand as marketing ramps up.

“I have a healthy child who is growing well because of this project” 
A mother who lost six children before this project started working in her village



What we do:


MaiMwana means “mother and child"" in the local Malawian language and our project is a research and development organisation based in the rural district of Mchinji in Malawi.
We work directly with mothers and communities to help them help themselves and their children. Our methods work. They've led to: 

a 70% reduction in deaths amongst mothers during pregnancy and birth
a 40% reduction in death amongst newborns



How do we do it?
We work with local communities to help them help themselves. We do this in a range of ways: 
We help women get the training to produce radio programmes to educate themselves. We help them lobby for bicycle ambulances so that women in labour can get to a health centre in time. We support communities in setting up group funds and small businesses so they have money to prepare for new children. We facilitate communities and health workers in understanding why mothers and children have died, so they can implement sustainable solutions (and we featured on the BBC for this work!). 
Our women’s groups identify problems and act together to solve them. Peer counselling, using mobile phones to gather and spread information, and finding out why people are dying, all lead to reductions in deaths and improvements in health.
We plan to improve and expand our community work, by involving men, working on family planning, improving nutrition, and improving child health.

""It's not a drug. It's not a vaccine. It's not a device. It's women, working together, solving problems, saving lives."" Richard Horton, Editor of The Lancet 

Why support us:

Securing funding for our on-going support of communities is a challenge. Your donation will allow us to continue working hand in hand with the local health team, reaching the most isolated and vulnerable communities, and helping women save lives.

The Team:

The MaiMwana team is made up of 80 incredibly dedicated staff, including over 50 field workers, data officers, nurses and midwives, PhD students and young Malawian researchers, as well as over 2,000 volunteers across the district. 
The team is led by the project manager Tambosi Phiri, a nurse by background, who has spent the last 10 years working with the local health management team. We also have partners at University College London, and the project's wonderful directors (Peter and Charles, both pediatricians), all dedicated to improving the lives of women and children in Mchinji. 

You can help us by:



Donating money to help us continue our work saving the lives of mothers and children
Sharing our campaign through social media

Following our updates and those of our partners (and here!)


By donating or sharing our campaign, you can help us save lives and improve the health and well being of communities in rural Malawi, so please donate and share!",2.0,1,"1 Campaign

</h3> <p>pcWRT is an <a href=""https://openwrt.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">OpenWrt</a> based wifi router. It comes with solid parental control tools to protect children on your home network.<br/></p>
<h3>What can you do with pcWRT parental control?</h3>
<p>Unlike parental control software that you have to install and configure on each and every device, pcWRT provides a centralized place from where you can manage your children's Internet access. With pcWRT, you configure the rules once at the router and all devices connected to your wifi network are protected - computers, smartphones, tablets, even game consoles with built-in browsers.<br/></p>Here are some examples of what you can do:<br/>
<ol>
<li>Block pornography and other undesirable content with <a href=""https://www.opendns.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">OpenDNS</a> or <a href=""https://connectsafe.norton.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Norton ConnectSafe</a>.</li>
<li>Prevent inappropriate images from showing up in Google search by enforcing SafeSearch.</li>
<li>Limit children's time on social networking and video sites such as Facebook, Instagram and Youtube, while allowing unlimited time for school related sites.</li>
<li>Turn off Internet at night for children only, with no impact on parent's Internet access or the functioning of your IP phone.<br/>
</li>
<li>Manage parental control settings from any device, either smart phone, tablet or your laptop pc.</li>
<li>Unlimited user/device specific white list/black list overrides.<br/>

<h3>What makes pcWRT different?</h3>
<p>Nowadays every wireless router comes with some kind of parental control feature, with varying degrees of usability and effectiveness.<br/></p>
<p>We believe pcWRT offers the best well-rounded balance between control, usability and effectiveness. We aimed to create a solution that parents love but children don't hate. We want to control the contents made available to children but not so much so that it inhibits usability. We want to block the ways that such controls can be bypassed, but we don't want parents to get a computer science degree in order to do that. Here's a short list of pcWRT's unique features:<br/></p>

<p>There is an employment paradox in the United States. Many
millions of jobs go unfilled at the same time that many millions of job seekers
struggle to find living wage employment. </p>
<p>For many thousands of the homeless, chronically poor, or
returning ex-offenders, finding and maintaining living-wage employment is an
uphill struggle.<span>  It is extremely
difficult for most to overcome the social stigma that employers often feel and
deploy when screening these applicants. </span></p>
<p>At the same time, in 2012 there were 1.7 million jobs that
went unfilled in the U.S. In 2014 that number rose to almost 3 million. By the year 2020 the number of unfilled jobs
is expected to surpass 5 million.<span>  The
cost to our economy for these unfilled positions is figured at $160 billion per
year.  </span></p>
<p>This paradox is causing many employers to move away from looking
only at people with a specific set of hard skills and experience, and are first
assessing candidates’ attitudes and behaviors to find the right ‘fit’ and then
training them for their available jobs. Those companies look carefully at the
soft skill traits of their current, proven top performers, then come up with a
profile of who is most likely to succeed, and hire people who match the
profile, even if their hard skills and experience aren’t ideal.</p>
<p>Racine Vocational Ministry, Inc. (RVM),<span>  a 13-yr. old non-profit organization located
in Racine County Wisconsin, is seeking $17,500 to pilot a six-month project
that will determine if employability can be improved for chronically
unemployed, homeless and ex-offenders through the use of ‘proven’ soft skill assessment
tools. </span></p>
<p>These assessment tools, such as those developed by Profiles
International, are well-established and used by thousands of employers
worldwide to determine how well job candidates ‘fit’
specific job opportunities. Funds will
be used to purchase an assessment system along with the inventory necessary to
assess forty pilot project participants.</p>
<p>The project will offer employers a free assessment report
that compares the individual’s
compatibility with performance benchmarks that are established by the employer.
This objective data will hopefully outweigh the negative perceptions that comes
with being chronically unemployed.</p>

</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Four members of an Israeli team and four members of a Palestinian team will join us as we live a 12-day, all-encompassing, NVC experience. Over the past few years, these eight have been attending annual, nine-day Nonviolent Communication immersion workshops for Israeli and Palestinian adults, together. That's where inspiration struck them to create
the first ever, combined Israeli-Palestinian NVC family camp.</p>
<p><b>Northwest Compassionate Communication regards NVC family camps as unique and fertile ground for giving rise to a next generation of skilled peacemakers. </b>Opportunities to practice the principles and skills of peace continually emerge, and the community supports conflict mediation, healing, empathy and honest sharing. And when families—especially
children—play, live, learn and relate compassionately with one another at camp, they
cultivate deep, lasting connections.</p>
<p></p>
<b>Your investment will make it possible for four Israeli and four Palestinian team members to:</b><br/><ul>
<li>Participate in an NVC family camp for the very first time.</li>
<li>Learn the ropes of planning, setting up, running and evaluating their own family camps.</li>
<li>Create the cross-cultural team bond they need to work together.</li>
<li>Camp in tents in the fields, forests, orchards and organic gardens of our 26-acre Cedar Spring Farm on Vashon Island—just a ferry ride from Seattle.</li>
<li>Connect with American and international families—from babes in arms to grandparents. (Many return to our camp, year after year, and even travel to visit each other between camps!)</li>
<li>Experience workshops, projects, crafts, theatre and nature adventures that weave concrete peacemaking principles and skills into their fabric.<br/>
</li>
<li>Debrief with the Vashon leadership team.</li>

<b>Thanks to you, they'll also take home:</b><br/><ul>

<p>Burning
Nest radio is coming live. This year let people hear your voice, your
ideas, your inspiration!</p>
<p>Burning
Nest Radio is an art &amp; communication project based on <a href=""http://burningman.org/culture/philosophical-center/10-principles/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the 10 principles of Burning Man</a><i><span><span>.
</span></span></i><span><span><span>We
plan to broadcast </span></span></span><span><span><span>community
created radio for 6 days </span></span></span><span><span><span>at <a href=""www.burningnest.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Nest festival</a>, the official UK regional burn</span></span></span><span><span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>running
from the 21-26 May</span></span></span><span><span><span>.
Nest</span></span></span>
is an inclusive and uplifting six
day
celebration of art, education &amp; music inspired
by Burning Man.
As
a non-profit organised
 &amp;
run entirely
by volunteers, Nest is a place for radical self-expression, discovery
and acceptance held
in our very own beautiful valley in West Glamorgan, South Wales.</p>
<p>Burning
Nest Radio hopes to perform a valuable function for the 460
attendees, both informing on useful information and providing an
opportunity for people to collaborate &amp; reach out to others with
their own brand of self-expression. <br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p></p>
<h3>What is Burning Nest Radio?</h3>
<p>Its
a short-term licensed radio station broadcasting for the duration of
Nest with 100% of content created by, and for, attendees. Content
will depend entirely on what people want to do, we rely on the
community to participate and create a schedule of music, talk,
comedy, and whatever else there is inspiration to create. Burning
Nest Radio will be broadcasting 24/7 for 6 days, so 144 hours of
content provided by you for you. At this point it isn't possible to
say what will be broadcast, but we trust the burner community &amp;
expect a wide variety.  We can quickly make a list of what you can
expect:</p>
<p>* Music
of course : all kinds and all tastes will be satisfied, and our
favourite DJs at Nest will also be part of the program. The
opportunity to present a radio show and select the music is open to
all – just volunteer - so there'll be a wide range to suit all
tastes. If you want to do a show featuring Ethiopian Dubstep, Country
&amp; Western Grindcore or just random tunes step forward &amp; take
the opportunity.</p>
<p>* Information
: a weather forecast, announcements of planned events, workshops &amp;
other impromptu occurrences, together with sudden changes to planned
events, information on the 10 principles of burning man and other
useful things.</p>
<p>* Talk
: talk shows, radio workshops, interviews, drama. Whatever people
want to create, the burner community is full of creativity,
imagination and variety &amp; we hope to give you – yes YOU - the chance to express yourself &amp; share with a wider audience.</p>
<p>* Community
Assistance : advertising for car sharing, important lost &amp; found
announcements, whatever else people need to know.</p>
<br/>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>
</p>
<p>We'll
be operating as an official, licensed short-term radio station and to
ensure we're acting within the law need to have OFCOM licences (both
Wireless Telegraphy Act Licence &amp; Broadcasting Act Licence) which
are around £600. 
</p>
<p>We
also have to pay the Performing Rights Society &amp; Phonographic
Performance Ltd who pay royalties to artists, musicians, songwriters
&amp; composers for any music played. This is around £550. In
addition there is equipment to obtain and other incidental costs.
We're very fortunate to be able to borrow most equipment &amp; to
have an Art Grant from Nest which covers part of the cost but we
still need to raise £800 (asking for £875 due to Indiegogo fees) which is why we're doing this Indiegogo campaign
and asking for your generous gifts.</p>
<p>Burning
Nest Radio, like Nest, is non-profit run by volunteers and no one is
paid. If we end up  collecting more money than we need the surplus
will be donated to Nest to defray the cost of the event or to support Nest for next year.</p>Our perks are all involving the radio station, we're not spending money to create tacky little give-away geegaws as we want to use it to create a great radio station, a vehicle for peoples creativity &amp; self-expression &amp; a public service to the Burner/Nest community.<br/>
</div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
<p>We're
broadcasting on the radio so everything we put out there will be
available not just to those on-site but anyone within range on the
right frequency, also by law all broadcasts have to be recorded and
kept for 42 days.  As such we might have to exercise a little
discretion in what's broadcast though throughout freedom of expression is
the key principle for us... with love, respect &amp;
fun of course. <br/></p>
<p>That said it's an opportunity too as anyone can pick
up our broadcast &amp; get introduced to what we're doing &amp; the
great spirit &amp; enthusiasm of our community. Throughout this
platform will be in the hands of those with ideas, creativity &amp; a
desire to participate. It'll be YOUR tool for fun, for love, for
pleasure, for information, for inspiration…</p>
<p>One definite challenge is scheduling &amp; PLANNING. If you've ever been
to a burner event you'll know about 'burner time' – things don't
always happen when they're expected to, plans change, no one looks at
a watch. That's something we just need to be flexible about. We'll
put a schedule in place, but we'll be adaptable. If you pledge money
and are due a reward, like your own show,  we will give you priority
&amp; aim to find a suitable time. <br/></p>
<p>
	
	
	
	

Our main challenge is

Burning
Nest radio is coming live. This year let people hear your voice, your
ideas, your inspiration!
Burning
Nest Radio is an art & communication project based on the 10 principles of Burning Man.
We
plan to broadcast community
created radio for 6 days at Nest festival, the official UK regional burn
running
from the 21-26 May.
Nest
is an inclusive and uplifting six
day
celebration of art, education & music inspired
by Burning Man.
As
a non-profit organised
 &
run entirely
by volunteers, Nest is a place for radical self-expression, discovery
and acceptance held
in our very own beautiful valley in West Glamorgan, South Wales.
Burning
Nest Radio hopes to perform a valuable function for the 460
attendees, both informing on useful information and providing an
opportunity for people to collaborate & reach out to others with
their own brand of self-expression. 



What is Burning Nest Radio?
Its
a short-term licensed radio station broadcasting for the duration of
Nest with 100% of content created by, and for, attendees. Content
will depend entirely on what people want to do, we rely on the
community to participate and create a schedule of music, talk,
comedy, and whatever else there is inspiration to create. Burning
Nest Radio will be broadcasting 24/7 for 6 days, so 144 hours of
content provided by you for you. At this point it isn't possible to
say what will be broadcast, but we trust the burner community &
expect a wide variety.  We can quickly make a list of what you can
expect:
* Music
of course : all kinds and all tastes will be satisfied, and our
favourite DJs at Nest will also be part of the program. The
opportunity to present a radio show and select the music is open to
all – just volunteer - so there'll be a wide range to suit all
tastes. If you want to do a show featuring Ethiopian Dubstep, Country
& Western Grindcore or just random tunes step forward & take
the opportunity.
* Information
: a weather forecast, announcements of planned events, workshops &
other impromptu occurrences, together with sudden changes to planned
events, information on the 10 principles of burning man and other
useful things.
* Talk
: talk shows, radio workshops, interviews, drama. Whatever people
want to create, the burner community is full of creativity,
imagination and variety & we hope to give you – yes YOU - the chance to express yourself & share with a wider audience.
* Community
Assistance : advertising for car sharing, important lost & found
announcements, whatever else people need to know.

   What We Need & What You Get 

We'll
be operating as an official, licensed short-term radio station and to
ensure we're acting within the law need to have OFCOM licences (both
Wireless Telegraphy Act Licence & Broadcasting Act Licence) which
are around £600. 

We
also have to pay the Performing Rights Society & Phonographic
Performance Ltd who pay royalties to artists, musicians, songwriters
& composers for any music played. This is around £550. In
addition there is equipment to obtain and other incidental costs.
We're very fortunate to be able to borrow most equipment & to
have an Art Grant from Nest which covers part of the cost but we
still need to raise £800 (asking for £875 due to Indiegogo fees) which is why we're doing this Indiegogo campaign
and asking for your generous gifts.
Burning
Nest Radio, like Nest, is non-profit run by volunteers and no one is
paid. If we end up  collecting more money than we need the surplus
will be donated to Nest to defray the cost of the event or to support Nest for next year.Our perks are all involving the radio station, we're not spending money to create tacky little give-away geegaws as we want to use it to create a great radio station, a vehicle for peoples creativity & self-expression & a public service to the Burner/Nest community.
  
  Risks & Challenges  
We're
broadcasting on the radio so everything we put out there will be
available not just to those on-site but anyone within range on the
right frequency, also by law all broadcasts have to be recorded and
kept for 42 days.  As such we might have to exercise a little
discretion in what's broadcast though throughout freedom of expression is
the key principle for us... with love, respect &
fun of course. 
That said it's an opportunity too as anyone can pick
up our broadcast & get introduced to what we're doing & the
great spirit & enthusiasm of our community. Throughout this
platform will be in the hands of those with ideas, creativity & a
desire to participate. It'll be YOUR tool for fun, for love, for
pleasure, for information, for inspiration…
One definite challenge is scheduling & PLANNING. If you've ever been
to a burner event you'll know about 'burner time' – things don't
always happen when they're expected to, plans change, no one looks at
a watch. That's something we just need to be flexible about. We'll
put a schedule in place, but we'll be adaptable. If you pledge money
and are due a reward, like your own show,  we will give you priority
& aim to find a suitable time. 

	
	
	
	

Our main challenge is 
	
	
	
	providing 6 days of content. 
BUT
the community is the answer, The BNR team trust the Burning Man community
to provide a varied, exciting & fun range of broadcasts to suit
all tastes. 
Even if you cannot give as much
money as you wish, don't be discouraged: volunteer your time &
creativity. We'll consider everyone & try to give you the
opportunity to broadcast, we do have 144 hours to fill so there
should a good chance of your voice spreading around Port Talbot and
the world.
There
is no problem, only a solution and the solution is YOU. 

So
get involved pledge to support us or contact us to volunteer &
create content for everyone to enjoy.

<p>Hey there; I'm Holly (that's me, on the left, up there ^). Welcome to my IndieGoGo campaign page. </p>
<p>I started my local food journey in 2007 when my daughter, then 16, told me she was going to become a vegetarian after watching PETA videos all night. Instead of opting out of meat, we opted in to the local food movement and started purchasing our beef, pork, poultry and seafood from ranchers and fisherfolks living within a 25 miles radius of our home.</p>
<p>In 2008 my passion for small, independent farmers and food producers was ignited when I helped start a <a href=""http://www.co.pierce.wa.us/ArchiveCenter/ViewFile/Item/599"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">farmers market</a> in our rural community on the Key Peninsula. For two years I managed that market, wrote a weekly newsletter, and engaged people in an active discussion around the benefits of eating fresh, whole foods grown by our neighbors.</p>
<p>My local food education continued when I added management of a suburban farmers market in <a href=""https://bremertonmarket.wordpress.com/2009/08/06/new-market-manager-and-cool-weather/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bremerton</a>, joined the <a href=""http://www.wafarmersmarkets.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Washington State Farmers Market Association</a> board, and participated with the <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/Tahoma-Food-Policy-Coalition"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/Tahoma-Food-Policy-Coalition/185065568205632"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tahoma Food Policy Coalition</a>.</p>
<p>In 2010, I co-founded the <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/FreshFoodRevolution"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Fresh Food Revolution Co-op</a> and managed the business until May 2014. During my tenure membership grew to 125 family/member-owners, we processed 50 orders a week during the peak season, and offered products from 33 growers, 2 dairies, 3 ranchers, 1 fisherman, and 13 food producers. <a href=""http://www.piercecountycd.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Pierce Conservation District</a> honored me with the ""<a href=""http://www.piercecountycd.org/images/tahomaViewPDFs/thm_vw_spr2012.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">2011 Commercial Farmer of the Year</a>"" award for creating the FFR Co-op and providing local farmers and food producers with a viable, year round market for their goods.</p>

<p></p>
<p>At heart I am a community organizer, idea generator and implementor, have interests in cooperative development, local food and family farming, gift economies, time banks, diversity, inclusion, kids, families, empowering people, and being good to each other.</p>
<b>
</b><p><b>So what's this campaign all about?</b> It's definitely about bringing quality, locally produced food, personal care and household items to the historic <a href=""http://www.freighthousesquare.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Freighthouse Station Marketplace</a> in Tacoma's Dome District - where locals and travelers mingle, entrepreneurs run awesome shops and restaurants (you can find everything from <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/SasquatchCinnamonRolls"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">enormous cinnamon rolls</a> to <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/NobleTrove"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Seahawks gear</a>, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/OliveBranchCafe"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">afternoon tea</a>, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/PTFishNChips"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">fish and chips</a>, and almost every international cuisine you can think of), and the <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/ShopFreighthouse"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">merchants are like a family</a>.</p>
<p>Enter <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/HollyhockMercantile"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>Hollyhock Mercantile</b></a>, an old fashioned general store meets a farmers market; where you'll know the names, history, and location of every person who makes, grows, or produces every item on every shelf. </p>
</div><div>
<p>Great things are coming to Freighthouse... and we want <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/HollyhockMercantile"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Hollyhock Mercantile</a> to be one of them. Not only will the South Sound have access to variety of beautiful, delicious, and sustainable foods available in one location, commuters will be able to pick up weekly CSA boxes on their way home, and soon Amtrak travelers will have the opportunity to take with them boxed lunches filled with these regional treats.</p>
</div><div>
<p>We'll stock everything from coffee, tea, and pastries to beef jerky, candy, and snacks, and even some on-the-go meal options as well as regular grocery items like flour, milk, butter, eggs, cheese, meat, seafood, ice cream, honey, herbs and spices, fruit, vegetables, flowers, bath and personal care products. </p>
<p>Local producers are enthusiastically embracing the mercantile's mission to not only showcase their goods, but to educate and inform the public on the best way to use ingredients (food demos! tastings! recipe cards!) and provide access to the good food for <b>all</b> members of our community.</p>
</div><div>
<p>Your contribution towards this campaign helps make <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/HollyhockMercantile"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Hollyhock Mercantile</a> a reality! You'll be giving me the opportunity to grow a new local food venture; one that aims to provide not only that wondrous connection between people and our food providers, but also allows me to offer a living wage to employees, and helps in furthering to strengthen our community.</p>

<p>The funds we raise via this campaign literally launches the <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/HollyhockMercantile"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Hollyhock Mercantile</a>, from the ground up. We're fortunate to have a space inside <a href=""http://www.freighthousesquare.com/#!freighthouse/cjn9"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Freighthouse Station Marketplace</a> awaiting our arrival, conveniently located on the platform side of the building, with two windows facing the trains.</p>
<p>The mercantile is already rolling right along thanks to an incredible team of friends who have donated their time and materials to help create this community mercantile. My brother is designing the floor plan, a wood floor has been donated, stationary and moveable display shelving units will be built by friends from Tacoma and Seattle, and I bet we'll host a painting party, or two.</p>
<p>As for the nitty gritty, here's what we need to open the mercantile:</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<center>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1344502/files/20150331222328-Hollyhock_Mercantile_Opening_Costs.jpg?1427865808"" src="""" style=""""/>
<br/><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span>
</center>
<br/>
</div><div>
<p>The costs of hosting the campaign, the credit card fees, and the perks costs shown above are the totals if <i style=""background-color: initial;"">all Perks levels completely sell out</i><span style=""background-color: initial;"">. So don't let those numbers scare you too much. We need 35K to open the store and about 10K to cover the costs of running the campaign. If we meet the 45K goal, IndieGoGo will refund 5% of the campaign hosting fees.</span></p>
</div><div>
<p>If, perchance, our campaign goes viral and all those Perks levels sell out, they will generate 76K in estimated profit (that's 103K gross, less the 27K cost estimate). So it does work out in the end.<br/><br/>What you get for your contribution, besides the satisfaction of helping me realize this dream, is a fantastic selection of Perks ranging from shout outs on our Facebook page, to a reusable tote or organic T-shirt with our logo (screen printed by a local artisan), food donations for low income families, to swanky parties for you and a few friends (parties you do not have to clean up after... can't beat that). We're pretty sure you'll find something fun to suit your budget and support the mercantile. </p>
</div><div>
<p>If we're missing a Perk level at which you want to participate let us know and we might be able to build one to suit your needs! Maybe we'll even let you name the level. How's that for a perk? :) </p>
</div><div style=""text-align: center;"">~ * ~ * ~</div><div><p>We're particularly excited to offer perk options to help our lower income friends and neighbors. For $150, the <b><i>Community Hug</i></b>, we will donate a box of non-perishable local food items to <a href=""http://www.northwestharvest.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Northwest Harvest Food Bank</a> in your name - this is our <i>Featured Perk</i>. </p></div><div>
<p>At the $350 level, Team Member Deen (our Cook Extraordinaire) will prepare the <b><i>Meal Time Helper</i></b> - five healthy dinners, three breakfasts, and two snacks for each person in a four member, low income household in Pierce County.</p>
</div><div style=""text-align: center;"">~ * ~ * ~<br/>
</div><div><p>If we don't reach our 45K fundraising goal, all monies raised will still go directly toward opening the <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/HollyhockMercantile"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Hollyhock Mercantile</a>. We do have a priority list; for instance, purchasing equipment and any inventory requiring cold holding may need to be delayed until more funds are raised, donations and/or grants received to cover those expenses. </p></div><div>
<p>Our community has already been extremely generous with their time, expertise, supplies, and enthusiasm; <span style=""background-color: initial;"">I have no doubt we will meet our goal, even if it takes a little longer than we'd like.</span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1345176/files/20150401032826-IGG_03_Impact.jpg?1427884106"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/HollyhockMercantile"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Hollyhock Mercantile</a> is an incubator of small, independent food producers, providing a year-round, accessible market showcasing their unique products. The store may be small (about 275 sq. ft. of retail space), but I'm big on commitment to local, sustainable food systems. </p>
<p>Finding these producers isn't easy for the average consumer, but is something I love doing... really, really love doing. I scout farmers markets, hunt down local food merchant guilds, surf independent farm organization webpages, cruise co-op shelves, and more. I am constantly on the hunt for new and wonderful producers. </p>
<p>I also have a strong desire to make quality food accessible to all people, regardless of socio-economic status. In addition to offering EBT (food stamps) redemption in the mercantile, we plan to create a fund to make locally produced food more affordable, as well as provide healthy meal preparation assistance, for low income families (see our Stretch Goals below for details). </p>
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">~ * ~ * ~</p>
<div>
<p>You've heard of <b>Stretch Goals</b>, right? <i>Think <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/elanlee/exploding-kittens"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Exploding Kittens</a>.</i> If we exceed our 45K campaign funding goal we have two terrific projects we'd love to launch.</p>
<p>The first is modeled after the <a href=""http://www.wafarmersmarkets.com/foodaccess/freshbucks.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Fresh Bucks</a> farmers market program in Seattle that doubles the buying power of SNAP/EBT customers for purchasing fruits and vegetables. Every dollar we raise between 45K- 50K will be set aside to seed our own version of Fresh Bucks, making the often more expensive locally produced food more accessible to low income individuals. </p>
<p>Funds raised between 50K - 55K will be used to officially launch the second project, Team Member Deen's <b>Meal Time Helper</b> program, to continue offering meal preparation assistance to low income families in Pierce County. The idea is to prepare a week's worth of meals (breakfast, snacks, and dinner) for busy, working folks without the time, expertise, or financial ability to cook healthy meals for their families.</p>
<p>Development and funding for both of these programs will continue after our crowdfunding campaign concludes through special purchase days, community participation in fundraising activities, and grant requests.<br/></p>
<p>The <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/HollyhockMercantile"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Hollyhock Mercantile</a> will be a community store with a mission to educate, promote, and <i>feed all the people</i>.</p>
</div>
<p><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1345166/files/20150401032411-IGG_04_Risks.jpg?1427883851"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>It's my goal to open the doors to the <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/HollyhockMercantile"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Hollyhock Mercantile</a> on June 1st - undoubtedly an ambitious goal. <i>Fear not friends for there is magic afoot.</i> </p>
<p>Back in the late 1990's I managed a small LGBTQ book store and coffee shop in Santa Barbara, CA, getting it out of debt and well on its way to becoming sustainable, while serving a relatively small clientele base. That was my first opportunity to build strong support for a common goal - a resilient community.</p>
<p>When I started the Key Peninsula Farmers Market in 2008, I did it in two months time without any previous farmers market experience. That was a steep learning curve and the knowledge, skills, and connections I gathered up then help make this road to opening day that much easier... including an excellent working relationship with the health department.<br/></p>
<p>My favorite way to overcome risks and challenges is by teaming up with others to pool our collective resources and ideas. The <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/HollyhockMercantile"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Hollyhock Mercantile</a> isn't *my* store, it's OUR store. From the first moment I shared my idea for the mercantile, friends were offering their support, ideas, guidance, materials, and more. I'm very lucky to have a team of advisors and confidantes who have already proven the <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/HollyhockMercantile"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Hollyhock Mercantile</a>  will be a success due to one simple concept: <b><i>Together we are stronger.</i></b></p>

</div></div>","Hey there; I'm Holly (that's me, on the left, up there ^). Welcome to my IndieGoGo campaign page.

For two years I managed that market, wrote a weekly newsletter, and engaged people in an active discussion around the benefits of eating fresh, whole foods grown by our neighbors.
My local food education continued when I added management of a suburban farmers market in Bremerton, joined the Washington State Farmers Market Association board, and participated with the Tahoma Food Policy Coalition.
In 2010, I co-founded the Fresh Food Revolution Co-op and managed the business until May 2014. During my tenure membership grew to 125 family/member-owners, we processed 50 orders a week during the peak season, and offered products from 33 growers, 2 dairies, 3 ranchers, 1 fisherman, and 13 food producers. Pierce Conservation District honored me with the ""2011 Commercial Farmer of the Year"" award for creating the FFR Co-op and providing local farmers and food producers with a viable, year round market for their goods.




At heart I am a community organizer, idea generator and implementor, have interests in cooperative development, local food and family farming, gift economies, time banks, diversity, inclusion, kids, families, empowering people, and being good to each other.

So what's this campaign all about? It's definitely about bringing quality, locally produced food, personal care and household items to the historic Freighthouse Station Marketplace in Tacoma's Dome District - where locals and travelers mingle, entrepreneurs run awesome shops and restaurants (you can find everything from enormous cinnamon rolls to Seahawks gear, afternoon tea, fish and chips, and almost every international cuisine you can think of), and the merchants are like a family.
Enter Hollyhock Mercantile, an old fashioned general store meets a farmers market; where you'll know the names, history, and location of every person who makes, grows, or produces every item on every shelf. 

Great things are coming to Freighthouse... and we want Hollyhock Mercantile to be one of them. Not only will the South Sound have access to variety of beautiful, delicious, and sustainable foods available in one location, commuters will be able to pick up weekly CSA boxes on their way home, and soon Amtrak travelers will have the opportunity to take with them boxed lunches filled with these regional treats.

We'll stock everything from coffee, tea, and pastries to beef jerky, candy, and snacks, and even some on-the-go meal options as well as regular grocery items like flour, milk, butter, eggs, cheese, meat, seafood, ice cream, honey, herbs and spices, fruit, vegetables, flowers, bath and personal care products. 
Local producers are enthusiastically embracing the mercantile's mission to not only showcase their goods, but to educate and inform the public on the best way to use ingredients (food demos! tastings! recipe cards!) and provide access to the good food for all members of our community.

Your contribution towards this campaign helps make Hollyhock Mercantile a reality! You'll be giving me the opportunity to grow a new local food venture; one that aims to provide not only that wondrous connection between people and our food providers, but also allows me to offer a living wage to employees, and helps in furthering to strengthen our community.







The funds we raise via this campaign literally launches the Hollyhock Mercantile, from the ground up. We're fortunate to have a space inside Freighthouse Station Marketplace awaiting our arrival, conveniently located on the platform side of the building, with two windows facing the trains.
The mercantile is already rolling right along thanks to an incredible team of friends who have donated their time and materials to help create this community mercantile. My brother is designing the floor plan, a wood floor has been donated, stationary and moveable display shelving units will be built by friends from Tacoma and Seattle, and I bet we'll host a painting party, or two.
As for the nitty gritty, here's what we need to open the mercantile:









The costs of hosting the campaign, the credit card fees, and the perks costs shown above are the totals if all Perks levels completely sell out. So don't let those numbers scare you too much. We need 35K to open the store and about 10K to cover the costs of running the campaign. If we meet the 45K goal, IndieGoGo will refund 5% of the campaign hosting fees.

If, perchance, our campaign goes viral and all those Perks levels sell out, they will generate 76K in estimated profit (that's 103K gross, less the 27K cost estimate). So it does work out in the end.What you get for your contribution, besides the satisfaction of helping me realize this dream, is a fantastic selection of Perks ranging from shout outs on our Facebook page, to a reusable tote or organic T-shirt with our logo (screen printed by a local artisan), food donations for low income families, to swanky parties for you and a few friends (parties you do not have to clean up after... can't beat that). We're pretty sure you'll find something fun to suit your budget and support the mercantile. 

If we're missing a Perk level at which you want to participate let us know and we might be able to build one to suit your needs! Maybe we'll even let you name the level. How's that for a perk? :) 
~ * ~ * ~We're particularly excited to offer perk options to help our lower income friends and neighbors. For $150, the Community Hug, we will donate a box of non-perishable local food items to Northwest Harvest Food Bank in your name - this is our Featured Perk. 
At the $350 level, Team Member Deen (our Cook Extraordinaire) will prepare the Meal Time Helper - five healthy dinners, three breakfasts, and two snacks for each person in a four member, low income household in Pierce County.
~ * ~ * ~
If we don't reach our 45K fundraising goal, all monies raised will still go directly toward opening the Hollyhock Mercantile. We do have a priority list; for instance, purchasing equipment and any inventory requiring cold holding may need to be delayed until more funds are raised, donations and/or grants received to cover those expenses. 
Our community has already been extremely generous with their time, expertise, supplies, and enthusiasm; I have no doubt we will meet our goal, even if it takes a little longer than we'd like.


Hollyhock Mercantile is an incubator of small, independent food producers, providing a year-round, accessible market showcasing their unique products. The store may be small (about 275 sq. ft. of retail space), but I'm big on commitment to local, sustainable food systems. 
Finding these producers isn't easy for the average consumer, but is something I love doing... really, really love doing. I scout farmers markets, hunt down local food merchant guilds, surf independent farm organization webpages, cruise co-op shelves, and more. I am constantly on the hunt for new and wonderful producers. 
I also have a strong desire to make quality food accessible to all people, regardless of socio-economic status. In addition to offering EBT (food stamps) redemption in the mercantile, we plan to create a fund to make locally produced food more affordable, as well as provide healthy meal preparation assistance, for low income families (see our Stretch Goals below for details). 

~ * ~ * ~

You've heard of Stretch Goals, right? Think Exploding Kittens. If we exceed our 45K campaign funding goal we have two terrific projects we'd love to launch.
The first is modeled after the Fresh Bucks farmers market program in Seattle that doubles the buying power of SNAP/EBT customers for purchasing fruits and vegetables. Every dollar we raise between 45K- 50K will be set aside to seed our own version of Fresh Bucks, making the often more expensive locally produced food more accessible to low income individuals. 
Funds raised between 50K - 55K will be used to officially launch the second project, Team Member Deen's Meal Time Helper program, to continue offering meal preparation assistance to low income families in Pierce County. The idea is to prepare a week's worth of meals (breakfast, snacks, and dinner) for busy, working folks without the time, expertise, or financial ability to cook healthy meals for their families.
Development and funding for both of these programs will continue after our crowdfunding campaign concludes through special purchase days, community participation in fundraising activities, and grant requests.
The Hollyhock Mercantile will be a community store with a mission to educate, promote, and feed all the people.



It's my goal to open the doors to the Hollyhock Mercantile on June 1st - undoubtedly an ambitious goal. Fear not friends for there is magic afoot. 
Back in the late 1990's I managed a small LGBTQ book store and coffee shop in Santa Barbara, CA, getting it out of debt and well on its way to becoming sustainable, while serving a relatively small clientele base. That was my first opportunity to build strong support for a common goal - a resilient community.
When I started the Key Peninsula Farmers Market in 2008, I did it in two months time without any previous farmers market experience. That was a steep learning curve and the knowledge, skills, and connections I gathered up then help make this road to opening day that much easier... including an excellent working relationship with the health department.
My favorite way to overcome risks and challenges is by teaming up with others to pool our collective resources and ideas. The Hollyhock Mercantile isn't *my* store, it's OUR store. From the first moment I shared my idea for the mercantile, friends were offering their support, ideas, guidance, materials, and more. I'm very lucky to have a team of advisors and confidantes who have already proven the Hollyhock Mercantile  will be a success due to one simple concept: Together we are stronger.

    

I know not all of you can contribute financially to the crowd funding campaign, but that doesn't mean you can't us help reach our goal. 
One of the most important things you can do for the Hollyhock Mercantile is to share this campaign with your friends, family, co-workers, neighbors, colleagues... anyone you think would be interested in supporting us in supporting local farmers, food producers, and the artisanal community, contributing towards our goals of providing access to healthy food for everyone, and creating a healthier, more resilient community.
When you share our story remember to tell folks why the Hollyhock Mercantile is important to you. 
Perhaps you have a skill to offer, or an idea to implement, or a product you think would be great for the mercantile? We love in-kind contributions, too! Just send us an email using the link in the upper left corner of the campaign page, or post a comment using the link at the top of the page.
Stay in touch with us after the store opens by signing up for our newsletter: http://eepurl.com/bjFGr5.
When the Hollyhock Mercantile opens, come on down to visit us; buy something local and delicious to take home and savor. Make it a habit; we can promise you'll always find something amazing at the mercantile.




Here's the mock up of the reusable Hollyhock Mercantile tote available at the $25 High Five / Fist Bump and $50 Gold Star perk level. Because I'm a buy local, support independent businesses gal, it's being printed by Andy at NW Fan Gear in Puyallup, WA. You can buy his stuff at another shop in Freighthouse: Noble Trove.",10.0,0,"1 Campaign

<b>So here's 10 facts about why Treeeo is NOT a pyramid scheme scam</b><br/>
</div><br/>
<p><span>1.<span> 
</span></span>You do not have to recruit anyone to grow your
Money Tree.  Treeeo is a connected
community, people are free to choose either to fund your Money Tree or not to
fund it</p>
<p><span>2.<span> 
</span></span>There is no downline, meaning that if ever you
do not raise any Money on Treeeo, nobody is affected whatsoever.</p>
<p><span>3.<span> 
</span></span>There’s no guarantee of profit, get rich fast
scheme or no-fail investment opportunity.</p>
<p><span>4.<span> 
</span></span>The more you connect and interact with people in
the community, the more they are likely to support your Money Tree.  </p>
<p><span>5.<span> 
</span></span>Whatever amount you’ve raised through your Money
Tree is yours, there’s no quota or target that you have to achieve to turn a
profit as there is no profit to achieve!</p>
<p><span>6.<span> 
</span></span>People funding your money tree do not receive
any commissions, they do so because they want to support you and in term they
might also receive support from you when required.</p>
<p><span>7.<span> 
</span></span>Treeeo is a vibrant network that enables
individuals to generate Money in order to support each other.  It’s more like a connected network of
individual fund raisers that share the same inspirations and want to grow
together.</p>
<p><span>8.<span> 
</span></span>There no product whatsoever to sell on Treeeo and
we would never ever ask you to do that.</p>
<p><span>9.<span> 
</span></span>Nobody is going to benefit from the funds you’ve
raised through Treeeo because it’s all yours</p>
<p><span>10.<span> 
</span></span>Treeeo makes money only through a service fee of
5% when you withdraw your money as simple as that.</p>

<br/>Treeeo
makes this possible while being fun at the same time.<span>  Take a little bit of crowdfunding, social
networking and a touch of green spirit; that’s all you need to start growing
your own money tree online with Treeeo because...<br/><br/></span>
</div><h1 align=""center""><span>Treeeo is &lt;mi_Crowdfunding&gt;</span></h1>
<p><br/></p><p>Treeeo
is the <b>World First miCrowdfunding* Platform</b> that brings crowdfunding to a whole new level.</p><p>
</p><p>In order for you to understand Treeeo, you should first understand that
Treeeo is at its core a crowdfunding platform and that’s where we start.</p>
<p><b>OH NOOOOO
another crowdfunding website – OH NOOOO another crowdfunding website in a Tree
costume…well don’t panic!</b></p>
<p>Treeeo is not your usual crowdfunding platform.</p>
<p>We needed to make Crowdfunding evolved, bring it to the next level so we
made it evolve in every aspect.</p>
<p>That’s when we came up with the term<b> *miCrowdfunding</b></p><h2 align=""center""><b>EXIT Crowdfunding... <br/></b></h2><h2 align=""center""><b>...Welcome miCrowdfunding</b></h2>

We’ve changed so many
things, that we could not call it crowdfunding anymore.<span>  We needed to differentiate Treeeo from
mainstream crowdfunding.  Treeeo will be
the very first of its kind.  The world’s
first miCrowdfunding platform. </span><br/><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br/><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Here's 5 reasons why miCrowdfunding will work for you!</h2><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1447785501/ehjla763txwtphvzngvt.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><h1 style=""text-align: center;"">Treeeo is a MONEY TREE<br/>
</h1><p align=""center""><b>Treeeo is a crowdfunding website in its core – its No. 1 function is
fund raising. No doubt about that.</b><br/></p><p>In order to make you understand both our Treeeo project and the concept of myCrowdfunding, we have created the <b>MONEY TREE</b>. The Money Tree is something that represent our concept, something that you can really relate to, something that puts Treeeo and myCrowdfunding all together cause we think having a Money Tree is something you've definitely been dreaming on for a long time and also cause we think Trees are cool!<br/></p><p>By growing your own money tree and
interacting with our community you also help other Treeeo community members to
grow their own Money Tree.  It’s helping
the community to help you to help them kind of thing.  Treeeo is a FREE service and will always be.  Sound’s interesting isn’t it?  Do you want to know more? Well let’s see how
Treeeo makes all this possible.<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">
</span></p><p>We’ve imagined Treeeo in such a way that we could fully harness the
power the crowd and integrate it to your daily activities, to your lifestyle.
As we said earlier, you would usually have to have a plan, project, idea, a product
and start a campaign out of it. <br/></p>
<p><b>No more of that with Treeeo, the difference is
that now “YOU” gonna be the campaign. </b><br/></p>
<p></p>
<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446056081/m7txf5nqlpaq2vxvdult.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446056726/ei3u5xcohwjygj78hjr7.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>How Treeeo works is quite simple…and I have to insist on that!<p></p>
<p>You join Treeeo through the usual Sign up process.</p>
<p>You get a dashboard from where you can easily access all the website’s
functions</p>
<p>There won’t be much activity at the beginning and even no Money Tree to
grow and that’s how it gets interesting.<span> 
</span></p>
<p><i><b>You don’t know
where to go to find people.<span>  Well we’ve
got some serious tools out there which connect to your social networks, and
even import contacts from your mailbox to make easier for you to find your
friends who are already connected and who might just need your help to get started as well.<br/></span></b></i></p>
<p>The good thing with Treeeo is that you are not alone…there’s a community
out there waiting for you</p>
<p>We’ve created Treeeo as one platform where all users are interconnected,
as we said earlier there’s no backer type or campaigner type, everyone depends
on everyone. What’s next then?</p>
<p><b>The Money Tree is the way Treeeo represents your data, your progression
on the platform and everything related to your fund raising activities.</b>         <br/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p><span>When a new “Money Tree is generated” on your dashboard.<span>  There are modules created (empty branches),
people clicked on these modules to fund them. 
This create even more modules which even more people can start funding and that's how
your Money Tree starts to grow… it goes on and on like that until you reach the
limit and your Money Tree is fully funded. 
Once the Money Tree is fully funded, the money raised is yours and you
can start all-over again.  When you
looked at it through our great imagination it actually looked like a Tree, a
tree which raised Money – well, a Money Tree. </span></span>                                                   <br/><span>

<p>The Money Tree is the heart of Treeeo, its where all the magic happen.  You receive funding through the interaction
that other people from the Treeeo community have with your Money Tree.  The more people fund your Money Tree, the More
it grows, the more Money you raise and there almost no limit in what you can
achieve with it.

feeling! To start there's only <b>ONE RULE...</b></p>

<p>To start your

<p>Funding an empty
branch is even easier.<span>  Once you have

default <b>One Empty Branch</b> will cost
you <b>25 Credits</b>.  If the required number of credits is
available on your account, the system will prompt you to confirm the
transaction and you are done!</span></p>
<p>As soon as the
transaction is completed, Treeeo automatically creates a new Money Tree for you
with empty branches that users in the community will have to fill-up. </p>
<p>You can also
personalize your Money Tree at that time with available themes and by writing
your first blog post by inserting a picture, video or text, anything you want,
we are quite flexible!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b><i>Quick FACTS</i></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b><i>Your Money Tree can hold up to 14 branches by default (14 x
25credits = 350 credits in total).<span>  By
the time your Money Tree is completely full, you will be earning 350 credits

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><b>How does Treeeo make
Money?</b></h2>
<p>We are committed in
making you an integral part of Treeeo and our business model, to bring success
for all of us.</p>
<p>As a business
partner we owe you transparency on how we intend to operate Treeeo as a
business and make it profitable. </p>
<h4 style=""text-align: center;"">This is how we earn
our bread;</h4>
<p>Treeeo
makes a profit during the conversion stage. 
You will notice that the Credit balance and the Cash Balance will always
be slightly different (Cash balance being just a little less than the actual
Credit balance).  This is the reason why
we have an Internal Credit System</p>
<p><b><u>Our conversion
rate works as follows (1 Credit = $ 0.95) which represents 5%</u></b></p>
<p>There is
no additional fee whatsoever, no if or maybe’s. 
What you see is what you get!</p>
<p>We have
worked our brains off to keep it as simple as possible, fair and financially
interesting for all of us. </p>
<p>Treeeo involves huge
short and long term investment in terms of money, time and brain juice to get
started and to stay sustainable on the long term.</p>

</div></div>","How Treeeo will work for you in real life...The mr. T chronicles!You might get confuse and we have to clarify that
So here's 10 facts about why Treeeo is NOT a pyramid scheme scam

1. 
You do not have to recruit anyone to grow your
Money Tree.  Treeeo is a connected
community, people are free to choose either to fund your Money Tree or not to
fund it
2. 
There is no downline, meaning that if ever you
do not raise any Money on Treeeo, nobody is affected whatsoever.
3. 
There’s no guarantee of profit, get rich fast
scheme or no-fail investment opportunity.
4. 
The more you connect and interact with people in
the community, the more they are likely to support your Money Tree.  
5. 
Whatever amount you’ve raised through your Money
Tree is yours, there’s no quota or target that you have to achieve to turn a
profit as there is no profit to achieve!
6. 
People funding your money tree do not receive
any commissions, they do so because they want to support you and in term they
might also receive support from you when required.
7. 
Treeeo is a vibrant network that enables
individuals to generate Money in order to support each other.  It’s more like a connected network of
individual fund raisers that share the same inspirations and want to grow
together.
8. 
There no product whatsoever to sell on Treeeo and
we would never ever ask you to do that.
9. 
Nobody is going to benefit from the funds you’ve
raised through Treeeo because it’s all yours
10. 
Treeeo makes money only through a service fee of
5% when you withdraw your money as simple as that.
Let’s start then by answering this question by another question that might
somehow be even more intriguing; 
Who never dreamed
of having his own Money Treee? I did! I'm sure you did too! 



Treeeo
makes this possible while being fun at the same time.  Take a little bit of crowdfunding, social
networking and a touch of green spirit; that’s all you need to start growing
your own money tree online with Treeeo because...
Treeeo is <mi_Crowdfunding>
Treeeo
is the World First miCrowdfunding* Platform that brings crowdfunding to a whole new level.
In order for you to understand Treeeo, you should first understand that
Treeeo is at its core a crowdfunding platform and that’s where we start.
OH NOOOOO
another crowdfunding website – OH NOOOO another crowdfunding website in a Tree
costume…well don’t panic!
Treeeo is not your usual crowdfunding platform.
We needed to make Crowdfunding evolved, bring it to the next level so we
made it evolve in every aspect.
That’s when we came up with the term *miCrowdfundingEXIT Crowdfunding... ...Welcome miCrowdfunding

We’ve changed so many
things, that we could not call it crowdfunding anymore.  We needed to differentiate Treeeo from
mainstream crowdfunding.  Treeeo will be
the very first of its kind.  The world’s
first miCrowdfunding platform. Here's 5 reasons why miCrowdfunding will work for you!Treeeo is a MONEY TREE
Treeeo is a crowdfunding website in its core – its No. 1 function is
fund raising. No doubt about that.In order to make you understand both our Treeeo project and the concept of myCrowdfunding, we have created the MONEY TREE. The Money Tree is something that represent our concept, something that you can really relate to, something that puts Treeeo and myCrowdfunding all together cause we think having a Money Tree is something you've definitely been dreaming on for a long time and also cause we think Trees are cool!By growing your own money tree and
interacting with our community you also help other Treeeo community members to
grow their own Money Tree.  It’s helping
the community to help you to help them kind of thing.  Treeeo is a FREE service and will always be.  Sound’s interesting isn’t it?  Do you want to know more? Well let’s see how
Treeeo makes all this possible.
We’ve imagined Treeeo in such a way that we could fully harness the
power the crowd and integrate it to your daily activities, to your lifestyle.
As we said earlier, you would usually have to have a plan, project, idea, a product
and start a campaign out of it. 
No more of that with Treeeo, the difference is
that now “YOU” gonna be the campaign. 

How Treeeo works is quite simple…and I have to insist on that!
You join Treeeo through the usual Sign up process.
You get a dashboard from where you can easily access all the website’s
functions
There won’t be much activity at the beginning and even no Money Tree to
grow and that’s how it gets interesting. 

You don’t know
where to go to find people.  Well we’ve
got some serious tools out there which connect to your social networks, and
even import contacts from your mailbox to make easier for you to find your
friends who are already connected and who might just need your help to get started as well.
The good thing with Treeeo is that you are not alone…there’s a community
out there waiting for you
We’ve created Treeeo as one platform where all users are interconnected,
as we said earlier there’s no backer type or campaigner type, everyone depends
on everyone. What’s next then?
The Money Tree is the way Treeeo represents your data, your progression
on the platform and everything related to your fund raising activities.         



When a new “Money Tree is generated” on your dashboard.  There are modules created (empty branches),
people clicked on these modules to fund them. 
This create even more modules which even more people can start funding and that's how
your Money Tree starts to grow… it goes on and on like that until you reach the
limit and your Money Tree is fully funded. 
Once the Money Tree is fully funded, the money raised is yours and you
can start all-over again.  When you
looked at it through our great imagination it actually looked like a Tree, a
tree which raised Money – well, a Money Tree.                                                     

                                                                           
                                                              
THE treeeo CYCLE                           

The Money Tree is the heart of Treeeo, its where all the magic happen.  You receive funding through the interaction
that other people from the Treeeo community have with your Money Tree.  The more people fund your Money Tree, the More
it grows, the more Money you raise and there almost no limit in what you can
achieve with it.


You wanna start to grow your Money Tree, you are excited?…I know the
feeling! To start there's only ONE RULE...


To get your
Money Tree, you have to fund a Money tree in the Community, it’s that Simple.
To get your
own Money Tree just fund a Money Tree out there.  EASY RIGHT…This is the only way the system will generate a New Money Tree on your Dashboard and all you have to do is start growing it










                                                                                                                                  


WELL LET THIS QUIZ DECIDE FOR YOU!





If you 
answered Yes to anyone of these questions, YOU definitely want to be 
part of Treeeo and what’s coming up next might be even more interesting.  SUPPORT OUR CAMPAIGN NOW AND MAKE IT HAPPEN

GOT SOME TIME FOR SOME EXTRA INFORMATION?


                                                                                 
 Let’s
get more technical…for those who like details, bytes and numbers
Do
you want to know more about how Treeeo works; well you got served with what’s
coming up next in this FAQ
How do I
start? (advanced version)
Anyone can
register on Treeeo with a valid email address and minimum age of 18 years
old.  
Treeeo has
built-in Facebook, Twitter and Google Plus integration which also allow you to
Sign Up/Sign In using your pre-existing accounts.
You can link
your Facebook, Twitter, Google+ account and even your PayPal account from your
profile page to enable quick sharing, purchases and withdrawal


Congratulations and
Welcome to Treeeo!
Your account is
now live.  You can start searching for
friends who are already registered on Treeeo or browse through the community to
find people that you might want to FOLLOW. 

You can import
your contact list from other platform, such as your e-mail platforms and Social networks
accounts to Treeeo to find your friends and get started even quicker.
Well you have
found some nice peeps around; it’s about time to get your hands dirty! You can
now kick start your Money Tree in just one little step.



To start
your own Money Tree you just have to fund another Money Tree, from anyone on
Treeeo.  It’s that SIMPLE.  Once you have successfully funded an empty
branch, you are re-directed to your new, fresh, own Money Tree which you can
start to grow immediately. 




People in
the Treeeo community are just like you, they are all looking for empty Money
Trees to fund in order to get their own Money Tree and that’s how Treeeo makes
growing money together more fun.



How does
Treeeo work? (Advanced version)
To start your
own Money Tree you have to fund an empty tree from anyone, YOU choose!  I’m pretty sure you have got the concept my
now.
Funding an empty
branch is even easier.  Once you have
found the Money Tree you want to fund, you click on one of its empty branch; by
default One Empty Branch will cost
you 25 Credits.  If the required number of credits is
available on your account, the system will prompt you to confirm the
transaction and you are done!
As soon as the
transaction is completed, Treeeo automatically creates a new Money Tree for you
with empty branches that users in the community will have to fill-up. 
You can also
personalize your Money Tree at that time with available themes and by writing
your first blog post by inserting a picture, video or text, anything you want,
we are quite flexible!
Quick FACTS
Your Money Tree can hold up to 14 branches by default (14 x
25credits = 350 credits in total).  By
the time your Money Tree is completely full, you will be earning 350 credits
which will then be immediately credited to your account.  

How do I
buy Treeeo credits?
One Credit = $1
Treeeo can
easily be linked to your PayPal account to enable faster transactions such as
purchases and withdrawals.
Credits can be purchased
directly on the Treeeo website with all major credits cards and through PayPal
as well.
A transaction fee may be applicable based on the
Payment Gateway you are using to process your payment.  
One Credit = $1
How much
Treeeo credits can I purchase?
You can purchase
as much credit as you want.  There is no
limitation on the number of credits that can be purchased on Treeeo
How do I
find people to fund my Money Tree?



The best way to get people to fund your Money
Tree, as for any other fund raising campaign, is to get noticed.

Follow as much people as you can from Treeeo
Connect to your friends online and help each other
Back as much people as you can
Invite your friends to join you on Treeeo
Share your Money Tree on Social Networks with our easy, fully integrated sharing tools.
Get fully involved in different campaigns and make new friend that will be ready to help you out as soon as your new Money Tree pops out

How many
Trees can I grow on Treeeo at the same time?
By default, when you just joined Treeeo, you can grow
up to 10 Money Trees at the same time. 
You can grow even more once you reach a higher Membership level.
I have
filled all empty branches, what next?
Bravo!!! All
your branches have been funded.  You can
now “harvest” your tree and start earning. 
By default the maximum pay out from one Money Tree = 350 credits
Once all your
branches have been funded, all credits are automatically loaded to your account
and you receive a notification.
You can view
your credit balance from your dashboard.
You can also use
available credit to fund other Money Tree directly from your credit
balance.  That’s extra convenient, as
using your credit balance is virtually free of charge and no transaction fee is
charged. 
How do I
convert my Treeeo credits to Cash?
We have got you
covered!  You do not have to do any
conversion at all.  Treeeo is pack with
some amazing features that would make your life even easier.
Hover on your
Credit Balance available on the dashboard and your actual corresponding Cash
balance will be displayed.  It’s just
that simple
How do I
withdraw my money?
You can link
your PayPal account from your profile page to make the withdrawal process even
quicker.
Once you have
hover on the Credit Balance to display your corresponding Cash Balance, the
withdrawal button pops up and you may decide to withdraw your fund now or
later.
If you decide to
withdraw your funds now, you will receive a notification in your live feed as
soon as the transaction has been successfully processed.
We intend to
implement more Withdrawal option such as Bank Transfer, Debit/Credit Card
transfer, and even more as we bring Treeeo live.                                                                  
                                                              



What kind
of privacy features is available on Treeeo?
Privacy is
something we take very seriously.  We
have included some great features to ensure that your experience on Treeeo is
and will always be enjoyable.  We will
NEVER share your information with anyone, NEVER!



You can FOLLOW
and UNFOLLOW any user as you wish.


You can BLOCK
any user anytime as well as unblocking them if you want later on.


You can set your
account to be Public – visible to the entire Treeeo community or Private – your
account will be visible only to users you have selected.  These features can be activated and
deactivated anytime.
Once your profile
is set on Private mode, all your activities such as your Money Trees, blog
post, earnings, etc. will be visible only to your selected users.  You can still follow users from the Treeeo
community and if you want anyone to follow you, you can send them an
invitation.
What kind
of notification will I receive?
We try to keep
our notifications simple, precise and non-invasive just the way we like our own
notifications to be.
All your
notifications are available through your Live Feed on your dashboard. You can choose to receive notifications
through your email as well.  This
feature can be activated and deactivated anytime and you may choose the
frequency on which you receive notifications.
You will receive
notifications for the following;



When
you have new Followers

When your Money Tree is funded
Once your Money Tree is fully funded
You will also receive news feed from people you FOLLOW on Treeeo
Once fund is credited to your account
When transactions such as purchases and withdrawals are successfully completed
When users are commenting on your Money Tree
When you receive a new message

How can I
earn more credits?
More Credit = More Money
Here is how you
can skyrock your credit balance and earn even more with Treeeo;



Earn
credits for inviting friends to join Treeeo

Earn credits as a reward gift as your membership status gets higher
You can decide to offer credits rewards to those who feed your empty branches, in order to attract more users to your Money Tree. 




For example,
the minimum credit requirement to fund an empty branch is set to 25
credits.  You can advertise an empty
branch at 20 credits only to attract more backers.  This means that the person who is funding your
discounted branch for 20 credits can start his Money Tree for even less.


Only people who
FOLLOW you and who receive a funding invitation from you can respond to such
offer.  All other users can still fund
this empty branch at the normal rate. 
This option is available as from Level 1.



How does Treeeo make
Money?
We are committed in
making you an integral part of Treeeo and our business model, to bring success
for all of us.
As a business
partner we owe you transparency on how we intend to operate Treeeo as a
business and make it profitable. 
This is how we earn
our bread;
Treeeo
makes a profit during the conversion stage. 
You will notice that the Credit balance and the Cash Balance will always
be slightly different (Cash balance being just a little less than the actual
Credit balance).  This is the reason why
we have an Internal Credit System
Our conversion
rate works as follows (1 Credit = $ 0.95) which represents 5%
There is
no additional fee whatsoever, no if or maybe’s. 
What you see is what you get!
We have
worked our brains off to keep it as simple as possible, fair and financially
interesting for all of us. 
Treeeo involves huge
short and long term investment in terms of money, time and brain juice to get
started and to stay sustainable on the long term.


                                                                  
We
think you already deserve a medal for reading all of this

For
us you’re already a winner and we know you want to be part of Treeeo.  Let’s make Treeeo happen NOW!!!

<p>While your knowledge, talent and technical skills might land you
a job, it is your people skills – or soft skills – that help you climb the
ladder of success. <b>Soft skills are essential!</b>  Your
communication, collaboration and team skills; your motivation, attitude, and
knowing when to lead and when to follow, are all important traits. They are
what make you a <b>champion</b> in your
job.  They help you work well with your
colleagues and bosses – whether they are easy or not. And they are but a few of
the behaviors that enable you to achieve your dreams in the workplace.</p>
<p><b>The problem is soft skills are underrated</b>. Many of our
schools do not teach them and most of our companies do not provide the training
needed to improve your ability to become a better problem solver, leader and a
valuable workplace asset. </p>
<b>The solution is Intellorus</b>.  Thanks to your support of this campaign,
Intellorus, the first online soft skills training platform, will be available
for you and your company to develop these crucial skills.<p></p>

</div></div>","While your knowledge, talent and technical skills might land you
a job, it is your people skills – or soft skills – that help you climb the
ladder of success. Soft skills are essential!  Your
communication, collaboration and team skills; your motivation, attitude, and
knowing when to lead and when to follow, are all important traits. They are
what make you a champion in your
job.  They help you work well with your
colleagues and bosses – whether they are easy or not. And they are but a few of
the behaviors that enable you to achieve your dreams in the workplace.
The problem is soft skills are underrated. Many of our
schools do not teach them and most of our companies do not provide the training
needed to improve your ability to become a better problem solver, leader and a
valuable workplace asset. 
The solution is Intellorus.  Thanks to your support of this campaign,
Intellorus, the first online soft skills training platform, will be available
for you and your company to develop these crucial skills.










When soft skills, or life skills training is infused with positive
values, we greatly improve our ability to work together as a winning team --
despite our differences --to solve the problems we face at home, at work, and
in society at large.








Imagine a “Netflix meets Electronic Arts” soft skills learning
environment!  That’s Intellorus!  We’ve been in corporate training and Fortune
500 performance improvement for more than a decade. We know what a toxic
workplace can do to you and your company.Many HR departments put employee well-being high on their lists,
but have very little time to address problem behaviors or the budget to launch
the multi-year programs needed to change a workplace for the better. 
We want to fix that!  With Intellorus, the
first and only online soft skills training
platform.  We want to provide easy,
accessible, affordable, and fun soft skills instruction keyed towards you
winning at what you do, and, in addition, helping your company build a better
workplace for all.       

 That’s Intellorus.

</div><p><b>Our Story:</b></p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to read about our campaign! We
are here to introduce to you the world’s first dating site and community forum.
We cater to both medical and recreational marijuana users, giving them a social
media platform and information/research center to connect with others who have
common interests, while at the same time, making a love connection! <b>Hempstersonly.com</b> is a one of a kind
dating and information platform providing love and social connections along
with interesting articles, forums, and more!</p>
<p>For people in our community, being a marijuana user isn’t
just an individual recreational habit, but is something embedded in our culture
and our social life. In the process of sharing this lifestyle with a potential
mate, telling someone that you smoke pot, even medically, can be a deal
breaker. When this lifestyle is your life, it can be difficult to give it up
for a relationship. Here at hempstersonly.com you won’t have to feel awkward in
disclosing your preferences, and can find someone who shares the same
interests, habits, and goals. </p>
<p><b>Impact:</b></p>
<p>We are working towards building a community of progressive,
forward-thinking, educated and articulate marijuana users. We are dedicated to
demolishing the stereotype that marijuana users are couch potatoes, uneducated
“burn-outs” who waste their lives on an illicit drug. We are reaching out to marijuana-friendly
people of all ages (adults), races, creeds, and sexual preferences.</p>
<p>Hempstersonly.com is unique to the dating sites out there
for two reasons. For one, we focus exclusively on marijuana users, ensuring
that our users can connect with others who are invested in the same lifestyle.
In addition, our website goes above and beyond the current marijuana dating
sites to provide orientations, articles, and blog news related to the status of
the fight to legalize marijuana nationwide. We also welcome our users to become
contributors to our community through an online forum about all aspects of life
including political, romantic, and more!</p>
<p>As the use of marijuana becomes decriminalized across the
country, more and more people are finding that they want to connect with others
who share the same interests, without the judgement, criticism, and debate that
can come along with explaining your choices to a new date. Hempsteronly.com can
provide that safety net, where you can rest assured that our clients are all
interested in similar hobbies and interests as you. </p>
<p><b>What We Need:</b></p>
<p>As a brand new website, we’re just in the final stages of
getting everything online and ready for our first clients. We are very excited
to share our new dating site with the world! We want to present it as a legit
product, so we are offering the first 4,200 customers to join for free,
including the first 4 months and 20 days FREE. This way we can give our clients
4,200 REAL choices, not filler, to connect with. Life is just too short to sort
through profiles of people who don’t actually exist!</p>
<p>For our campaign we are aiming to raise $12,000 to get us
through the first 4 months of providing FREE services to our new clients. We
anticipate that our numbers will be at least twice that once we are fully
operational after the first 4 months, which will give us a chance to earn back
the money that went towards our new clients, and begin reaching out to
thousands of people looking for love. Isn’t that what it’s all about?</p>
<p><b>So what are you waiting for? Find
the perfect match! <u>Register Now!</u> To meet classic singles who are
marijuana friendly. Start Dating Now!</b></p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can
Help:</b></p>
<p>If you can’t make a donation at this time, we understand
that times are tough for everyone out there! But don’t fear! There are still
ways you can help support our campaign! Please take a few minutes to share our
information with your friends and family via social media, email, and through
word of mouth! </p>
<p>With your generous donations we can go live with our first
set of clients and make romantic dreams come true for thousands of dedicated
marijuana enthusiasts!</p>

<p>What do you believe is the single greatest challenge or
problem of our existence? if you were to say: overpopulation, population, global warming, childhood obesity, marital infidelity,  corrupt politicians, etc.., you would probably be right. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">At Montabass Academy, our  take the position that the single greatest challenge of our
existence is getting what we need, want, desire, crave, yearn and/or burn for.
In other words, we believe that our existential problem is in solving how we
get from where we are today (aka. here) to where we need and want to be
tomorrow (aka. there). We believe that this has been the problem since the
beginning for time.</span></p>
<p>Just think about it. When
we are hungry, what happens? When we have the need for attention and care, what
happens? When we have the desire for a better life, what happens? When we want
material possessions, what happens? When we crave power and fame, what happens?
When we yearn for the love of another, what happens? This list can go on and
on. The point is that it does not matter what the “there” is.  The “there” can be as mundane as getting to
work on time or as grand as finding a cure for cancer.  Because of this existential problem we are
driven to try or execute a myriad of ways by which we will ultimately be
successful. We only stop seeking fulfillment when we have succeeded in getting
what we want or need. </p>
<p>That seems pretty straight forward right?  The sad reality, however, is that the vast
majority of people are not succeeding in getting what they need, want or
desire. Far too many family members, friends, and people that we have met in
our lives struggle to actually achieve that which they set out to achieve.
They tend to settle for what they feel is considered “success” not what they
actually sought out to be “success”.  We
have always been curious as to why. Why, when presented with comparable opportunities, are
there individuals that seem to superbly capitalize on opportunities
and overcome whatever obstacles, challenges or roadblocks put
before them and succeed? While there are others who never
show up, barely make it out the gate, give up along the way or simply
never reach the pinnacle of their success.  Then there are individuals who
attend every wealth and success seminar, read every book on the latest
""secrets to success"", and follow the ""success gurus""
on social media platforms, but again, never quite get there. </p>
<p>Now, we are not defining success in money terms alone,
but rather, the successful pursuit and attainment of any worthy goal.
 And while we could probably speak generally about success and how to be successful,
we are focusing specifically on 3 areas that we called the foundational areas
our lives. That is success as an individual, success as a couple and success as
a parent.  We called them foundational areas because research proves that success
in one of all of these areas not only makes success easier to achieve in other
areas of our lives, but also that the probability of peak success if almost guaranteed.</p>
<p><b>Existing Solutions</b></p>
<p>If you conducted a Google
search on Personal Development and Success Training, you will get roughly 18+
Million hits. These hits undoubtedly include notable individuals and companies
ranging from Napoleon Hill, Earl Nightingale, 
Tony Robbins International, Landmark Forum, Eric Thomas, Les Brown,
Brian Tracy International, plus an innumerable quantity of companies and
individuals that all claim in one fashion or another to help individuals
achieve various levels of personal, relationship and financial success.  Now, it is not our intention to examine and
evaluate the effectiveness of the major programs in the marketplace.  Instead, we would like to share our
experiences and the experiences of many of our friends and associates that have
attended and been students of these programs and teachings.  </p>
<p>We are not going to
minimize the huge positive impacts that many of these organizations and
individuals have in the lives of everyday people.  For example, some are very powerful in
getting individuals inspired and motivated for big changes and profound transformation;
many programs help the participants develop a change in perspective sometimes
leading to tremendous breakthroughs. Both Landmark and Life Spring Training
come to mind here.  A number of programs
also lead to the development of a number of new abilities and skills.  Moreover, many have an ancillary type
benefits like forming new friendships and support groups, beginning a lifelong
journey of self-reflection and improvement and simply being a better human
being. </p>
<p>However, despite these
huge benefits that cannot be denied, we have unfortunately experienced and witnessed
a number of cons as well. For instance, some people feel that many of these
organization tend to be cult like in nature. They tend to focus more on the
personality of the founders rather than upon the soundness and ability to
duplicate its teachings in a variety of situations and circumstances.  Many participants leave post event feeling inspired
and motivated to take on the world, to change their lives or at the very least
make some significant behavioral changes. This feeling however, is short lived
with the attendees seeing or experiencing no lasting tangible differences in
their lives.  A large percentage of these
programs are more focused on providing information rather than the development
of practical skills. Many times this overemphasis on knowledge leads to
information overload with the program participants. Also, a number of programs
lack any effective assessment or Gap-Analysis component.  This piece is critical for determining what
“is” or “is not” working. Because once this is known, it is important that
corrective action be taken on the spot to modify that which is not working and
codify that which is working.  Many of
these programs, unfortunately have little in the way of providing feedback
loops. Finally, the teaching of some, not all but some, is not supported by
rigorous research.  </p>
<p><b>Our Solution</b></p>
<p>At Montabass Academy, our aim is to fill this gap. We take an
""applied science"" approach to the study and realization of success
and achievement.  We begin by  systemically examining the existing research on achievement to identify
the critical problems that stop people from being successful as individuals, as
couples and as parents.  We then identify the best in class solutions for solving those
problems. Finally, we develop ""seminars"" and ""workshops""
that are designed to not only lead to a fundamental shift in perspective on
success and achievement, but more importantly lead to the attainment of
those repeatable and sustainable skills necessary for resolving those critical
problems that impede success as an individual, a couple and as a parent.  </p>
<p><b>The Offering</b></p>
<p>The seminars and workshops that
we  are designed and conducted differently from many of the
alternatives in the marketplace. That is, while we understand how knowledge
leads to a better awareness, understanding and perspective broadening, we know
that knowledge alone is not enough to effectively solve the critical challenges
of achieving that which we set out to achieve.  It is only when a person has develop the skills
and executed those skills consistently is success more probable.  Thus while there will be a knowledge portion
to each and every seminar and workshop, there will also be hands-on exercises
and drills that will lead to the development of the necessary skills. But this
is just the beginning. There will be a review and assessment portion to the
course so that the student will know what is and is not working. Moreover,
there will be a feedback mechanism so that action can be taken to continuing
doing what is working and modify what is not working. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Where we are right now?</b></p>
<p>Whenever we share this story with others, we get comments like:
Wow! That is incredible! Why didn't I think of that, and so on?  Thus, we
know that it is a good business model conceptually; what we don’t know yet is
if there is a willingness of potential customers to pay for the service.  </p>
<p>We have our general business plan outlined. We know what the core
problem(s) that we will be seeking to solve are. We have a business model of
how we will go about solving the defined marketplace problem. We have our website
completed; we are promoting our business and getting the word out via our blog,
Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn pages. We have a few FREE introductory events scheduled.  There are, however, still a few things we
still need to launch.</p>
<p><b>What else do we need?</b></p>
<p>We are looking to put together a small research team to
help us put a model that we can scale.  We have certain needs like: </p>

<p>2.<span>

<p></p>
<p><b>How you can help?</b></p>

king. Thus, the first contribution that you can help with to build this model
is cash. We need approximately $150K for startup costs that will cover both
talent acquisition costs and other business startup and operational related
costs. </p>
<p>To make this dream a reality,
we need a small, yet passionate, team. While we can’t provide top pay for top
researchers, we are looking to attract young and bright talent either still in
school but at the senior level or newly graduates that have extensive research
experience. We are hoping that they see this as an opportunity to work on real
world problems while gaining real world experience. The money will be used for </p>

No matter how you eat it, the flavor will always stand out.  It is more tender than pulled pork, more versatile than bacon, more flavorful than any meat you have ever had, and possibly more addictive than crack.  We guarantee you'll fall in love with it and be eager to see just how many ways you love to eat it.<p></p> </div><div>Here at Slaughterhouse Sandwich Company, we believe success is measured not just by what you're able to do for yourself, but more importantly what you do for others.  That is why we are committed to making a difference.<br/>
</div> <div> <h3></h3>
</div><p></p><h3>About this project</h3><p></p><p>There are a lot of sandwiches out there and a lot of meats, but as amazing as meat is, most either require the addition of sauce or their flavor is lost when sauce and toppings are added. A meat that is flavorful enough to stand up to sauces and toppings as well as stand alone is needed. Something that can be served on a sandwich, piled on a baked potato, rolled in a burrito, tossed in a pasta, or scrambled with eggs is something that just isn't out there. But for now, let's just start with the sandwich.  </p><div><div>The Slaughterhouse meat is unlike any other meat you've ever had. It is a unique blend of meats and a variety of cuts that creates a flavor like nothing else. Don't worry, there's nothing strange in it. Its texture is similar to pulled or shredded pork, but it is much richer and more flavorful due to the happy marriage of fats. Originally it was designed to go on a sandwich, but its versatility has led it to find itself in eggs, on potatoes, in pastas, and pretty much anywhere you can imagine. Everyone has a way they think is best, be it the sauce they prefer, the toppings they put on it, or simply just eating it by itself.  <p></p>
<p>The popularity of the meat has led us to make it the center of our restaurant concept. While the long term goal is to eventually open a traditional brick and mortar restaurant serving the meat in a variety of ways, for now we are simply starting small. Our immediate goal is to just focus on the sandwich and in doing so, start a pop up sandwich shop and catering company. By doing this, we have the opportunity to test the market and develop a following with minimal financial risk, hopefully raising the capital needed to open a traditional establishment. </p>
<div>
<p>As a pop up sandwich shop, our target market are meat lovers and sandwich lovers everywhere. That's a pretty large group, so for now, we're mostly hoping to pop up near colleges and market to the early twenties crowd.</p>
<p>One of the many beauties of the Slaughterhouse Sandwich is that no one makes anything like it, meaning there's no direct competition. Indirectly, we'll still be competing with other sandwich and burger joints, but the only place you can get a Slaughterhouse Sandwich is from us.</p>
<p>Here at Slaughterhouse Sandwich Company, we believe success is measured not just by what you're able to do for yourself, but more importantly what you do for others. That is why we are committed to making a difference. From day one, 15% of all profits (not start up contributions) will be donated to charities. This is just the starting point. At this time, most profits will be going directly back into the business so that we can grow. Once we become truly established, we hope to increase that 15% significantly. Each month we will select a specific charity to support. In addition to the base 15% designated for that charity, we will also work to build events and promotions to raise even more money for that charity. All selected charities will support causes that are typically supported by almost everyone, such as cancer research, feeding the homeless, and finding cures for intolerable diseases. </p>
<p>In an effort to make our dreams a reality, we have put together a small team that includes an artistic designer, a social media liaison, an attorney that specializes in intellectual property, and a business editor to help with writing and editing our official business plan. In addition, we have made numerous contacts in Chicago's culinary field and business development, securing further advice and assistance along the way. Combine the knowledge and abilities of our supporters with my fifteen years of restaurant experience, from back to front of the house, and we have a group that's destined to succeed.</p>
<p>Slaughterhouse Sandwich Company has what it takes to establish itself first as a pop up sandwich shop and then grow into a national phenomenon. Just like with the meat itself, the possibilities are endless.</p>

</div></div><p></p><h3>Risks and challenges</h3><p>While our goal is to eventually grow into a traditional restaurant, we've decided to start off small as a pop up sandwich shop and catering company. This limits the the financial risk overall and minimizes the start up funds needed.</p><p>By establishing ourselves at a regular venue one day a week, say at Bob's Bar every Tuesday from 11-2, or until we run out of meat, we should be able to create a loyal fan base and a higher demand through a limited supply. If people that love the sandwich know they can only get it on Tuesdays, they'll be sure to be there on Tuesdays. This concept also allows us to hit a wider market once we secure multiple weekly locations in different Chicago neighborhoods.</p><p>The biggest obstacle is finding locations that are willing to work with us. As of now, we've begun our search by targeting bars and restaurants that are closed at times that could be profitable for us. In that way, we are not competing with the services these establishments offer and we would be able to not only be profitable on our end, but also bring profit to these locations at a time when they are generating zero revenue.</p><p>On the catering side of things, the biggest concern is licensed kitchen space. While there are many rent-able spaces available, the cost of renting forces us to significantly raise our price point. Thankfully I have secured a licensed kitchen at a reasonable; however, that kitchen is still under construction, but should be available early 2016.</p><p>There is also some concern that by operating as a pop up we may not be able to keep up with demand and thus limit our success and profits. While that is potentially an issue, it would be a good problem to have. Should that time arise, if we have been unable to secure enough to open our own place, we will begin to seek financial investors and have a proven product to work with.</p><p>With every project there are risks, but this idea has been in the works for the last four years and it is time to set it in motion. After working in the restaurant industry for over a decade, I can confidently say that any challenges that come my way will be small compared to those challenges I faced teaching high school for six years. In both cases, it's a passion for work that makes me successful. I loved teaching and I loved the kids. I love food, I love this meat, and I love this concept. Hopefully you do to.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>BUDGET IN BRIEF</h3><p></p><p><span><span><span>INDIEGOGO GOAL:     $10,000</span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>LICENSING, CERTIFICATIONS, ETC. </span></span><span>                                                                       $2000</span></span></p><p>    Estimated cost for all of our business start up fees including but not limited to all of our start up licensing with federal, state, and local governments, trademarking, etc.  </p><p><span><span><span>PROMOTIONAL MERCHANDISE AND MARKETING FEES</span></span><span>                                       $2000</span></span></p><p>    Estimated cost for promotional events and materials such as kickoff events, t-shirts, printing, etc.</p><p><span><span><span>CATERING SUPPLIES AND KITCHEN NEEDS</span></span><span>                                                           $1000</span></span></p><p>    Estimated cost of necessary kitchen and catering supplies including but not limited to chafing dishes, pots and pans, induction burners, cooking utensils, and paper goods for packaging.</p><p><span><span><span>FOOD COSTS (FIRST SIX WEEKS)</span></span><span>                                                                            $1500</span></span></p><p>    Estimated food costs for the first six weeks of operation.  This should hopefully be covered by sales, or at least off set a bit; however, to guarantee that we can give the business a chance to grow, we need to be prepared to take a loss in the first few weeks as we learn to adjust to our sales potential, supply and demand.</p><p><span><span><span>MISCELLANEOUS COSTS AND CUSHION</span></span><span>                                                              $1000</span></span></p><p>    Just in case we have some expenses that were overlooked, it's always good to have a cushion.  This will also help cover shipping costs for kickstarter promotions and labor costs when needed.</p><p><span><span><span>TAXES AND INDIEGOGO FEES</span></span><span>                                                                              $2500</span></span></p><p>    You know Uncle Sam is going to take some of what we raise.  Thankfully our goal is low enough that we shouldn't take a huge hit, but it's better to be prepared.  Plus Indiegogo gets a cut and there are fees for credit card processing.</p><br/><p></p><h3>Biography</h3><p>I've done a little bit of everything over the years.

<h3>Caruma is Hiring</h3>
<p>We’re not a traditional technology company. And we’re not looking for traditional technologist. We’re looking for the rock stars. The outliers. The driven. The optimists who engage and influence others. The ones who believe there are always faster, simpler, or just plain better ways to do things with ideas that excite and inspire us. Ideas that capture our imagination and leave us thinking of the possibilities long after the meeting has ended.

<h3>Risks and Challenges</h3>
<p></p>
<p>We’ve spent the last year working on the hardware, software and design challenges. As engineers, programmers, developers and designers, these are the sort of challenges we love, and our ongoing prototype testing has given us real faith that we’ve minimized the future risks.  However, we are doing something that has never been done before: a compleltly revolutionary device like nothing else in the market. There will always be unknowns when creating a new product, but we're up to the challenge.  In the interest of making the best product we can, specifications described could be subject to small modifications which we will announce in the ""Updates"" section.  We take your trust in us very seriously. We will endeavor to make sure our Indiegogo backers are delighted about joining us on this adventure.  </p>

And were providing the tools to make that a reality.  We can’t wait to see what you come up with. So go for it. Build away! 



Not Just Another Piece of Technology 

When creating something that is meant to sit above your car's dashboard, it became even more important that we designed something that you'll be happy with being there all the time. To achieve this, we’ve put a lot of time into making sure our design language is congruent. You’ll notice that the curvature of Caruma’s body is precisely the same as the camera lenses, and all of the other features have exactly the same circular shape. Paying attention to these details and sticking strictly to our design language is what has made our product so sexy — if we do say so ourselves.

Protecting you and your car doesn’t need to be complicated. Or expensive. Caruma sets up in minutes with no installation, contracts, or monthly fees required. Simply place Caruma above your car’s dashboard, plug it in, and connect it to your smartphone. That’s it!

<div>Mr. Delicious Snack Bar is a family owned small food business that has touched the hearts of millions of visitors and locals 7 days a week, from its opening in the year 1981 until today. Mr. Delicious is located on the white sands of Enterprise Beach also called ""Miami Beach"" in beautiful Barbados.</div>
<div>What makes Mr. Delicious such a delicacy is its homemade style of freshly prepared deliciously flavored ""Bajan"" or ""Barbadian"" food, drinks and desserts. The love and art of Barbadian food is rapidly being lost to fast-food chains and hotel brands across the island. However, Mr. Delicious has maintained that local love for its food and its true bajan heritiage and has drawn customers worldwide to return annually and tell others of the Fish cakes, Flying Fish Cutters, Roti and other delightful items on the menu, passing on this culinary enjoyment on for generations. <a href=""http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1918898-d1992155-Reviews-Mr_Delicious-Enterprise_Christ_Church_Parish_Barbados.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">(Click here to View Trip Advisor Reviews)</a>

The documentary will raise awareness of the lack of access to fresh foods and alternative wellness practices in the United States; capturing stories along the way of the American path to wellness and proliferating our message to a global audience.Long Term Plan:We aim to discover what most improves the quality of life for all people and develop an approachable holistic lifestyle that can be easily integrated into our daily lives; a lifestyle that incorporates healthy eating, exercise, and meditation as a way to connect deeply and live freely.“Meditation is associated with improvement in a variety of psychological areas, including stress, anxiety, addiction, depression, eating disorders and cognitive function, among others.” (Meditation Health Benefits)We will send APSARA Life teachers to each town that we encounter along our roadtrip to train local community members in order to set up 10 sustainable “Wild Wellness” hubs across America in areas with the little access to alternative health; creating a ripple effect of healing transformation.When we heal ourselves we heal the world. We are all interconnected, the health of our nation reflects our personal health and well-being. No one should be left out.“If every 8 year old in the world is taught meditation, we will eliminate violence                                      from the world within one generation.”                                                            Dalai LamaEveryone has the right to live a happy,                          healthy life!

<p>My name is Linton Reid and I'm the creator of Spider Vac, the humane bug catcher. It's the first suction bug catcher to incorporate an extraction blow out feature.
</p>
<p>I created the first version of Spider Vac back in 2008 while I was running my small sourcing and importing company, Shinesun Ltd. <br/></p>

My name is Linton Reid and I'm the creator of Spider Vac, the humane bug catcher. It's the first suction bug catcher to incorporate an extraction blow out feature.

I created the first version of Spider Vac back in 2008 while I was running my small sourcing and importing company, Shinesun Ltd. 
Ever since quickly selling out my initial run of 10,000 units I've had numerous requests to bring Spider Vac back to the market and have decided now is the right time. This time around however, I'm going to make it as good as it could be, while still keeping it at a reasonable price of £14.99 RRP.

<div>I sure do.  I was born and raised in my hometown of Syracuse, NY and I come from a family of 7, (6 boys and 1 girl).  For my parents, making ends meet was the priority; which meant, after our basic necessities were met and if there was anything left in the household budget, we could gorge ourselves on what seemed to be the best food on the planet, Pizza!  This we got from our neighborhood institution, at least 1 night a month, and believe me, we looked forward to it and loved every minute of it.</div>

I sure do.  I was born and raised in my hometown of Syracuse, NY and I come from a family of 7, (6 boys and 1 girl).  For my parents, making ends meet was the priority; which meant, after our basic necessities were met and if there was anything left in the household budget, we could gorge ourselves on what seemed to be the best food on the planet, Pizza!  This we got from our neighborhood institution, at least 1 night a month, and believe me, we looked forward to it and loved every minute of it.
In a moment, i'll explain how a sweet delicious ice cream cone ties into all of this...   What We Need & What You Get Break it down for folks in more detail:  Bottom Line; A local Pizza shop has come up for sale.  I spoke with the owners and was able to negotiate a $40,000 purchase price with a $25,000 down payment.  I have $5,000 and would like to raise the other $20,000 plus $5,000 for initial daily operating expenses.  It's completely a turn-key opportunity, it's fully operational with everything included, (Ovens, coolers, prep tables, refrigerators, freezers, etc.). Located in the heart of a family neighborhood, the customer base is established and in place.  We would like to see that customer base grow through our advertising, competitively low prices, promotions and continued efforts to offer high quality products and great customer service.  
One of the many short term goals is to is to add a full service Ice Cream Parlor during the spring and summer months with Hand Scooped Cones of Fresh locally made Ice Cream for $1.00.  This one effort, along with our other planned strategies should ""help us"" increase our daily revenue from the current $400-$600, to our first year goal of $1,000 a day.  

The current owners of the Pizza Shop do not do any sort of advertising.  Our plan is to use the U.S. Postal Services' EDDM direct mail marketing campaign within the first 30 days of acquisition to launch our venture and tell the world we are ready for their business.
If the goal isn't reached, the funds will be used to pay the sellers, (if I can successfully negotiate a purchase with a lower down payment, which i will continue to do); invest it in an equally viable Pizza restaurant opportunity if one is found within 30 days of Campaign End, or...
If we don't successfully reach either of our goals, all contributions received will go directly to the local Upstate Golisano Children's Hospital in the form of a Cash Donation with each contributor named as a proud sponsor.  Even if we don't reach our goal, your generosity still goes to a worthy cause.
