Pharmacy, Davenport House Museum, at 323 E. Broughton Street in Savannah,
Georgia. It is my first time to plan, prepare and curate an event individually
and I will take charge for all aspects of the event in order to ensure the success
of this exhibition.</span></p>
<p><b>What is the show displayed about?</b></p>
<p>Established
in 1733, Savannah is known for its stunning coastline, rich history, and warm
southern hospitality. As one of the original 13 colonies and the oldest city in
Georgia, Savannah is endowed with a culture focused on art. From the beautiful
Historic District, to River Street, every small angle gives visitors a sense of
art. Perceptions of Savannah is a visual arts exhibition showcasing artworks
concentrated on drawing the artists’ recognition and interpretation about the
art elements embedded in Savannah’s history, culture, architecture and social
life. These descriptions in artworks will take the viewers on a unique journey
through lovely Savannah from an artist’s point of view. The artworks will be
selected through online call for submissions, selecting 7 artists from SCAD
Savannah campus to showcase their interpretation of the beauty of Savannah
through their artworks. These artworks may be realistic or abstract, embodying
the high artistic techniques and unique perspective of Savannah through artists’
eyes. </p>
<p><b>The show will take place at Historic Kennedy Pharmacy,
Davenport House Museum in Savannah, Georgia August 5-7 with opening reception
the night of August 5 from 5-9 pm. </b></p><p><b>The opening reception will open
to the public, featuring with free food, happy music and gorgeous artworks.</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>What will we need? </b></p>

indiegogo campaign will not only help me to cover budget of the event, but also
to advertise and promote this exhibition to a wider range of audience. The
money we get from this indiegogo campaign will be completely used for the
expense of exhibition, making sure to provide best environment, facilities, and
food and beverage for the people who attend my exhibition. </p>
<p><b>The perceptions of Savannah total needs to raise
$1,200 for the exhibition, and the budget is broken down as follows:</b></p>

three days Kennedy Pharmacy rental fee</p>

Am I?My name
is Shengzhang Gu, a Chinese graduate student from Arts Administration Master of
Arts Program at Savannah College of Art and Design (SCAD). In order to fulfill
the requirement of Arts Administration program and finish my Arts
Administration final project, I will curate a thesis exhibition titled
Perceptions of Savannah from August 5 to 7 at Historic Kennedy
Pharmacy, Davenport House Museum, at 323 E. Broughton Street in Savannah,
Georgia. It is my first time to plan, prepare and curate an event individually
and I will take charge for all aspects of the event in order to ensure the success
of this exhibition.
What is the show displayed about?
Established
in 1733, Savannah is known for its stunning coastline, rich history, and warm
southern hospitality. As one of the original 13 colonies and the oldest city in
Georgia, Savannah is endowed with a culture focused on art. From the beautiful
Historic District, to River Street, every small angle gives visitors a sense of
art. Perceptions of Savannah is a visual arts exhibition showcasing artworks
concentrated on drawing the artists’ recognition and interpretation about the
art elements embedded in Savannah’s history, culture, architecture and social
life. These descriptions in artworks will take the viewers on a unique journey
through lovely Savannah from an artist’s point of view. The artworks will be
selected through online call for submissions, selecting 7 artists from SCAD
Savannah campus to showcase their interpretation of the beauty of Savannah
through their artworks. These artworks may be realistic or abstract, embodying
the high artistic techniques and unique perspective of Savannah through artists’
eyes. 
The show will take place at Historic Kennedy Pharmacy,
Davenport House Museum in Savannah, Georgia August 5-7 with opening reception
the night of August 5 from 5-9 pm. The opening reception will open
to the public, featuring with free food, happy music and gorgeous artworks.

What will we need?

indiegogo campaign will not only help me to cover budget of the event, but also
to advertise and promote this exhibition to a wider range of audience. The
money we get from this indiegogo campaign will be completely used for the
expense of exhibition, making sure to provide best environment, facilities, and
food and beverage for the people who attend my exhibition.

</div></div>","Aloha! My name is Rose Adare, I’m an evocative
artist disabled by a muni train in 2005. To get through the hard
times, I began painting truly inspiring, brilliant, out of the box people, and
now I have solid offers for shows guaranteed in Oakland, San Francisco,
Seattle, AND Brooklyn, NY! But I need your help to get there! 
I’m not asking for plane tickets or hotels. I’ll
sleep on couches and eat ramen. But I need help with shipping and production
costs.
I’ve had three amazing shows already, at the Hawaii Museum of Contemporary Art,  The J+ Gallery in Holualoa, and the
prestigious Maui Arts & Cultural Center's Schaefer Portrait Gallery, but now
it’s time to reach the mainland. 
Hawai'i is 75 miles across and
is 2,467 miles from California.  That's a long distance to move 31
paintings, 5 plexiglass shadowboxes, and 35 plexiglass descriptions—especially
when some of the paintings are 10 x 7 feet! The powerful success behind
Restraint & Revolution “took a village,” and now it’ll “take a continent”
to move across the ocean.  

I paint people—dynamic, fascinating, multicultural
role models changing the world through art, music, and social activism. As an
educational art tour, Restraint & Revolution shares their biographies with their portraits to begin a conversation with the audience—a
conversation about social taboo’s in the 21st century. Sex. Gender. Age. Body Image. Disability. Free Expression. Spiritual
Identity. What does it mean to challenge social norms, today? Each mind-blowing model in Restraint &
Revolution wears a form of corsetry as a symbol of social restraint and
personal revolution.Some of my 40 inspirational models include:


Queer
sexologist, Carol Queen.


Native
American advocate & Academy Award winning folk legend,       Buffy Sainte-Marie


One
of America’s leading GLBTQ public speakers, Kimberly Dark.


Olympic
Medalist & Motivational Speaker, Annetta Lucero


Body-Mod
artist & Guinness World Record holder, Kala Kaiwi


Epic
Burning Man sculptor & founder of American Steel, Karen Cusolito


Whirling
Dervish and founder of Velocity Circus, Gregangelo.

Astounding visual makeup couture, Devin Mohr
Choreographer & Stanford's Artistic Director of Black Performing Arts, Robert Moses. 

Actress
and Olympic Medalist, Dreya Weber 

Culinary Chef & Food body Artist, Tiberio Simone 
Sister of Perpetual Indulgence, Sister Eve Volution

Genderqueer
adult performer, Jiz Lee


And Iconic Singer-Song Writer, Jason Webley

Likewise, just as corsetry evolved from chaste
undergarments to scandalous lingerie, Restraint & Revolution reclaims
classical portraiture as a new form of evocative art. As an art series, Restraint
& Revolution pushes the boundaries of classical and contemporary art by
uniting traditional mediums with wild diversity. Portraits you would never see
in a museum before, are finally making their entrance.  
 
STRETCH GOAL is $7,550! Only $2000 more!
Help me get these amazing paintings to New York!I’ve been offered a 2500sq gallery for a month in Brooklyn, with an opening, mid-point event and closing show! This will give me time to court other museums and galleries in New York. AND I will be painting through-out, so people can come and watch me. So New Yorkers, get me to the Big Apple!!!!  I'll even paint one of your own and unveil them at the closing show!!!
$1500 for round trip shipping from California, to New York, back to California.
$250 for promotional materials for all 3 events in NY.
$300 food for 3 events in NY.
My first goal was achieved! Restraint & Revolution from Hawaii, to Oakland, to San Francisco; will fund and
promote three events at American Steel Studios, The Academy of Art University,
and the San Francisco Center for Sex & Culture; and initial storage.  


$750 for packing supplies & to build 2 more shipping crates (5x4x4ft) I
     have 5 crates already built & paid for! FYI materials in Hawai'i
     are pricy.

$1500 to ship door to door from Hawai’i to Oakland, CA.
$1000 for show costs, including fuel (fire
     performers/flaming sculptures) + permits + security, for all 3 events.  
$750 for promotional materials for all 3 events. 
$500 to transport paintings to each event, including U-haul
     rental for 3 days + plus gas + help lifting crates.  
$1000 Food & Beverages for all 3 events.

Total $5500, for three amazing art shows in
California, spreading the message of 40 inspiring people working hard to
improve our world.

<p><b>The Culture for
Tolerance Foundation invites you to help in creating Trans*Festival – the first event of this scale in Krakow, entirely
dedicated to transgender and gender diversities. 
</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>""Trans*"" in the name of the festival means all forms of gender identities and expressions which differ from unequivocally male or female, or those who are unequivocally male or female but differ from gender assaigned at birth. For a long time, 'T' has
been neglected by the LGBT ( lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender) rights movement in Poland, and we would like to help
fill that gap.</p><p></p><p>
One
of the most discriminated groups in Polish society are people
of non-heterosexual
and non-heteronormative identities. Polish law does not sufficiently
defend
people from discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. LGBTQ people face discriminatory behaviors in all fields of
social life: education, employment, everyday activities. 
</p>
<p>
<span>According to report published by </span><span><span>Campaign Against Homophobia in 2012 more than half of LGBT respondents revealed being subjected more than once to various forms of violence based on sexual orientation</span></span>. <b>Over
half of transgender people, who took part in the research, have
experienced physical or mental violence because of their transgender
identity</b> (Campaign Against Homophobia, ""Social situation of LGBT

It is our understanding that insufficient knowledge underlies social exclusion of transgender people in Poland. <b>We believe that increasing awareness of gender diversity will contribute to more critical thinking about dominating gender norms and discourses. 
</b></p>
<p>
During the festival we would like to address yet another critical issue which is the <b>cisnormativity of Polish LGBTQ community</b>. We want to promote both awareness of unique needs of transgender people and solidarity between groups representing the broad spectrum of gender and sexual diversities here in Poland. <br/>We strive for visibility of binary and non-binary transgender identities in public discourse, art and culture. The issue of gender
non-conformism in public discourse is dominated by medical questions.
The motivation of the project is the need of <b>building sustained
cooperation within transgender community in Poland and introducing
issues of transgenderism to potential trans* allies.</b></p>

The Culture for
Tolerance Foundation invites you to help in creating Trans*Festival – the first event of this scale in Krakow, entirely
dedicated to transgender and gender diversities. 



""Trans*"" in the name of the festival means all forms of gender identities and expressions which differ from unequivocally male or female, or those who are unequivocally male or female but differ from gender assaigned at birth. For a long time, 'T' has
been neglected by the LGBT ( lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender) rights movement in Poland, and we would like to help
fill that gap.
One
of the most discriminated groups in Polish society are people
of non-heterosexual
and non-heteronormative identities. Polish law does not sufficiently
defend
people from discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. LGBTQ people face discriminatory behaviors in all fields of
social life: education, employment, everyday activities. 


According to report published by Campaign Against Homophobia in 2012 more than half of LGBT respondents revealed being subjected more than once to various forms of violence based on sexual orientation. Over
half of transgender people, who took part in the research, have
experienced physical or mental violence because of their transgender
identity (Campaign Against Homophobia, ""Social situation of LGBT
people. Report from 2010-2011"", Warsaw 2012). What is worth mentioning here, Poland has not introduced any law regulations which refer to hate speech or civil partnerships yet.  

It is our understanding that insufficient knowledge underlies social exclusion of transgender people in Poland. We believe that increasing awareness of gender diversity will contribute to more critical thinking about dominating gender norms and discourses. 


During the festival we would like to address yet another critical issue which is the cisnormativity of Polish LGBTQ community. We want to promote both awareness of unique needs of transgender people and solidarity between groups representing the broad spectrum of gender and sexual diversities here in Poland. We strive for visibility of binary and non-binary transgender identities in public discourse, art and culture. The issue of gender
non-conformism in public discourse is dominated by medical questions.
The motivation of the project is the need of building sustained
cooperation within transgender community in Poland and introducing
issues of transgenderism to potential trans* allies.

What is
Trans*Festival all about?


We want to achieve
greater visibility for trans* issues in various ways, combining
theory with practice, and bringing academic knowledge face-to-face
with the life experiences of guests both from Poland and abroad. The
socially-engaged language of photography and film will be paired with
workshops for trans* people and their allies.


We have five EXHIBITIONS lined up;

Chicago photographer JESS T. DUGAN whose portraits of trans* people we will be showing at the Grey House Gallery on Cracovian Main Square. The opening will take place on the evening of Thursday 28th May.






A series of photographs by OLIVIER TOURON from Lille, depicting the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence. Notwithstanding their theatrical appearance, the organisation does charity work, helping people living with HIV/AIDS. The opening of the exhibition will take place during the Queer May Festival at the Barakah theatre; Trans*Festival will organise the grand closing.






RYSZARD KISIEL & KAROL RADZISZEWSKI. These
historical images are the result of a photo shoot by gay activist Ryszard Kisiel  and a
group of his friends in the mid-80s. In an apartment, playing around
with props, lipsticks, and costumes made spontaneously from leftover
scraps of material, they created their own parallel universe of camp,
separated from the realities of communist Poland. We will also be
displaying photographs by one of the most prominent Polish artist Karol Radziszewski documenting the making
of the film “Kisieland”.




IRENA KALICKA, a photographer from Krakow, will put on exhibition prepared especially for Trans*Festival at the F.A.I.T. Gallery.


AROBAL, the
renowned artist who designed the promotional poster for
Trans*Festival, will put on his first exhibition in Krakow especially
for our festival.

 
    We will be
showing 4 DOCUMENTARIES: “Trans-akcja” - the story of Anna
Grodzka, one of the most active ambassadors of LGBT rights in Polish Parliament and first openly transgender MP in Poland, who will be also the guest of Trans*Festival, “Magic Mirror” about French surrealist Claude Cahun, “My Prairie Home” about Canadian artist Rae Spoon…



... and the Japanese
film “Miwa: A Japanese Icon”.

<h3>Who are we?</h3>
<p>We are Annika, Emma, and Aileen. We are a coach, an illustrator, and a writer. We come from Germany, Hungary, and Scotland. </p>
<p>This project started with a shared realisation that we — all too often — forget how beautiful we really are and how many wonderful resources we have inside us, just waiting to be used. So we decided to join forces to create something special that would help us to reconnect with ourselves and our unique treasures.</p>
<ul>
<li>Annika (driven by her coaching experience) designed questions and prompts that tap into just the right spot in your brain.</li>
<li>Emma fired up her creative imagination and channeled her child-like playfulness to paint images from her heart, inspired by Annika's questions.</li>
<li>And Aileen worked her word magic between the two, finding the best phrasing to touch your heart or make you laugh.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1540416429/ymcjmerjulux2na7fhdb.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Along the way we realised that the cards also have the power to spark meaningful connections. This has become the central part of our broader mission. In fact, it's already been successful in our case: although they haven’t (yet) met in person, Emma and Aileen are already good friends as a result of sharing this project!</p>
<p>We want to use part of the funds we raise to go on a bit of a 'guerrilla' mission to spread the love in our local neighbourhoods, but our longer term ambition is to travel together to different parts of Europe, and use the cards to connect with the strangers we meet along the way.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we hope that — in your hands — these postcards will take on a life of their own.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1540461270/ptlauw8wozmwl8kndqts.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What are the cards for + how can I use them?</strong></p>
<p>These cards are a simple tool to spark connection, both with others and with yourself. They speak to the rational and emotional parts of your brain by using thought-provoking questions and playful images to inspire creative answers. </p>
<p>We've developed two sets of fifteen cards: a kind set and a cheeky set. The images on both sets are the same, but the wording of the prompts is somewhat different! The kind cards are created with soft love and the cheeky ones with tough love. We hope both sets will inspire you and make you smile.</p>
<p>Here’s an example:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1540418021/zwy29hujequyg7yqldoe.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We’ve designed the cards with both your personal and professional life in mind, so feel free to use these sets as creatively as you like.</p>
<p><strong>On your own you can...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>use them as journal prompts</li>
<li>put them on your wall for inspiration on tap</li>
<li>travel with them and give one to someone you meet on the way</li>
<li>pop one into a stranger's mailbox and make them smile</li>
<li>take the conversation online and share a picture of it using our hashtag: #conversationsparkers </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>With others you can...</strong></p>

</div><p> </p></div>","Who are we?
We are Annika, Emma, and Aileen. We are a coach, an illustrator, and a writer. We come from Germany, Hungary, and Scotland. 
This project started with a shared realisation that we — all too often — forget how beautiful we really are and how many wonderful resources we have inside us, just waiting to be used. So we decided to join forces to create something special that would help us to reconnect with ourselves and our unique treasures.

Annika (driven by her coaching experience) designed questions and prompts that tap into just the right spot in your brain.
Emma fired up her creative imagination and channeled her child-like playfulness to paint images from her heart, inspired by Annika's questions.
And Aileen worked her word magic between the two, finding the best phrasing to touch your heart or make you laugh.

 

 
Along the way we realised that the cards also have the power to spark meaningful connections. This has become the central part of our broader mission. In fact, it's already been successful in our case: although they haven’t (yet) met in person, Emma and Aileen are already good friends as a result of sharing this project!
We want to use part of the funds we raise to go on a bit of a 'guerrilla' mission to spread the love in our local neighbourhoods, but our longer term ambition is to travel together to different parts of Europe, and use the cards to connect with the strangers we meet along the way.
Ultimately, we hope that — in your hands — these postcards will take on a life of their own.
 

 
What are the cards for + how can I use them?
These cards are a simple tool to spark connection, both with others and with yourself. They speak to the rational and emotional parts of your brain by using thought-provoking questions and playful images to inspire creative answers. 
We've developed two sets of fifteen cards: a kind set and a cheeky set. The images on both sets are the same, but the wording of the prompts is somewhat different! The kind cards are created with soft love and the cheeky ones with tough love. We hope both sets will inspire you and make you smile.
Here’s an example:

 
We’ve designed the cards with both your personal and professional life in mind, so feel free to use these sets as creatively as you like.
On your own you can...

use them as journal prompts
put them on your wall for inspiration on tap
travel with them and give one to someone you meet on the way
pop one into a stranger's mailbox and make them smile
take the conversation online and share a picture of it using our hashtag: #conversationsparkers 

 
With others you can...

send one to a friend via good, old snail mail
talk about a few with a friend over a mug of hot coffee
use one or two sets to play as a memory card game
shuffle two sets and spice up your next party by handing a card to each guest, then wait for some top quality mingling to begin as they search for their match
 In a professional setting you can...

put them to use for a more meaningful team-building session 
decorate a corner of a shared work space and let them inspire some lovely tea-break chats
use them in a coaching or tutoring session to help your client think and reflect

 

 
Do you have your own ideas? We’d love to hear them! 
Share them with us through our hashtag: #conversationsparkers.  
 

What we need + what you get

After months and months, our beautiful cards are all designed and ready to go! Now we need customers and money to go for an initial print run in time for the festive season. 
When you purchase a perk, it will arrive in your mailbox (or letterbox if you're in the UK!) — sent with love. 
If we reach our €1,500 goal, we would be able to print a few hundred extra cards for our 'guerrilla' mission, as well as delivering your perks.
If we go past our €1,500 goal, we’ll invest any extra funds into a European journey, with the aim of expanding the #conversationsparkers project by making and documenting connections with new people, using our cards.
We’d also really love to invest more of our time and skills to create new cards. 
Our favourite perk is The Conversation Sparker: this perk contains both sets of cards (30) that we developed with love.
If we don’t reach our €1,500 financial goal, we will just deliver the perks that you have purchased through this Indie Go Go campaign.

 


 
So welcome on board! Pick your perk or share our campaign.

<h2>The Paint Crate</h2>
<p>Are you feeling bored, stuck at home, or at a loss of creative ideas?  Looking for a solution to creative self-care without spending a tonne of money on full size art supplies that you may not ever use again?  Are you wanting to experiment with new art media, but again, nervous to spend the money on full size materials without knowing how much you'll enjoy using them? </p>
<p><br/>I have a solution for you!!!  How would you like to receive a Paint Party Kit to your door?!<br/><br/>The other day, I was struck by a moment of inspiration.  I miss teaching my painting and art journaling classes in person.  And then...subscription boxes popped into my head.  I did some research.  Most art related subscription boxes send you miscellaneous supplies that you have to create your own project with, should you accept the challenge.  You may or may not fall in love with the full size supplies that you receive, and your project is 100% up to your creativity.<br/><br/>WHAT IF a box existed that included everything necessary for a single complete art project, AND you got to tune in to a virtual paint party (or the recording of the paint party) with guidance, just like attending a live class, but in the comfort and safety of your home?  Would you be interested? <br/><br/>I am committed to creating an amazing service for you and the creatives you love!  To give you single servings of art supplies to experiment and play with, and lessons to support connection and inspiration. <br/><br/>Preorder your first Paint Crate today!  <br/><br/>Thank you for your support!<br/><br/>I look forward to creating with you!<br/> </p>
<h3>A Bit About Liz</h3>
<p>Hello!  Thank you for supporting this initiative!  I am committed to supplying international creatives with samples of art supplies and lessons to spark their creativity from the safety and comfort of their homes.</p>
<p>I am a self-taught artist.  Following a head injury, I fell into depression.  I discovered art as a method of self-care and self-discovery.  It was therapeutic for me in many aspects.  And as I learned more, I recognized and experienced more benefits of a creative practice. </p>
<p>And now, here I am...an entrepreneur and full time artist.  I am beginning the journey of weaning off depression medication (with medical support, guidance, and blessing).  And I am working towards supporting and helping others to create a meaningful creative self-care practice in order to fill their self-care cups, so that they may go out into the world with joy and share that joy and love with the people around them.  </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The goal:</p>
<ul><li>$3000 CAD - enough to create the first 50 boxes, and gain bulk discounts so that I can pass along the savings to you!</li></ul>
<p>There is A LOT more cost than I had realized...</p>
<ul>
<li>small containers for the paint</li>
<li>seals for the containers</li>
<li>labels</li>
<li>brushes</li>
<li>canvas or other substrate for creating on</li>
<li>large containers of paint</li>
<li>packaging, including boxes, tape and tissue paper</li>
<li>shipping (I need a prototype to calculate shipping costs)</li>
<li>other art supplies for future boxes (I have a huge variety of ideas!)</li>
</ul>

<p>THANK YOU from the bottom of my heart!</p>
</div></div>","The Paint Crate
Are you feeling bored, stuck at home, or at a loss of creative ideas?  Looking for a solution to creative self-care without spending a tonne of money on full size art supplies that you may not ever use again?  Are you wanting to experiment with new art media, but again, nervous to spend the money on full size materials without knowing how much you'll enjoy using them? 
I have a solution for you!!!  How would you like to receive a Paint Party Kit to your door?!The other day, I was struck by a moment of inspiration.  I miss teaching my painting and art journaling classes in person.  And then...subscription boxes popped into my head.  I did some research.  Most art related subscription boxes send you miscellaneous supplies that you have to create your own project with, should you accept the challenge.  You may or may not fall in love with the full size supplies that you receive, and your project is 100% up to your creativity.WHAT IF a box existed that included everything necessary for a single complete art project, AND you got to tune in to a virtual paint party (or the recording of the paint party) with guidance, just like attending a live class, but in the comfort and safety of your home?  Would you be interested? I am committed to creating an amazing service for you and the creatives you love!  To give you single servings of art supplies to experiment and play with, and lessons to support connection and inspiration. Preorder your first Paint Crate today!  Thank you for your support!I look forward to creating with you! 
A Bit About Liz
Hello!  Thank you for supporting this initiative!  I am committed to supplying international creatives with samples of art supplies and lessons to spark their creativity from the safety and comfort of their homes.
I am a self-taught artist.  Following a head injury, I fell into depression.  I discovered art as a method of self-care and self-discovery.  It was therapeutic for me in many aspects.  And as I learned more, I recognized and experienced more benefits of a creative practice. 
And now, here I am...an entrepreneur and full time artist.  I am beginning the journey of weaning off depression medication (with medical support, guidance, and blessing).  And I am working towards supporting and helping others to create a meaningful creative self-care practice in order to fill their self-care cups, so that they may go out into the world with joy and share that joy and love with the people around them.  
 

What We Need & What You Get
The goal:
$3000 CAD - enough to create the first 50 boxes, and gain bulk discounts so that I can pass along the savings to you!
There is A LOT more cost than I had realized...

small containers for the paint
seals for the containers
labels
brushes
canvas or other substrate for creating on
large containers of paint
packaging, including boxes, tape and tissue paper
shipping (I need a prototype to calculate shipping costs)
other art supplies for future boxes (I have a huge variety of ideas!)

IF my goal is not reached, that is ok!  I will order and deliver what is requested.  Some supplies have different prices for different quantities, so I have some flexibility.  Don't worry.  You will receive your products!

<h3>A Most Accidental Beginning</h3>
<p>In July of 2017, I stumbled into the world of candle making because of an article I read at the barbershop about a local company.  All I was interested in was making something special for my Mom's birthday, as well as for my special someone, so I inquired. Within a month, I was apprenticing for the founder of said candle company, and shortly after, was encouraged to come up with my own line. A holiday candle I created all on my own had an initial run of 100, which sold out within two weeks.</p>
<p>Sadly, it was too good to be true. In early 2018, it became apparent I wasn't getting paid what I was owed or receiving proper credit for what I'd created. Worst of all, I had convinced friends and family to buy from this company, and now I felt like a chump. Cheated, stolen from, and humiliated, I took my wax and went home. Until I realized: <i><strong>FORGET THAT MESS.</strong></i></p>
<p>Accidentally, I had found a unique skill that could become a going concern. Something to make and be proud of; and a way to be creative and show people the world as I feel it through our most powerful sense - smell. I have one sensitive schnoz. I have a passion for music &amp; literature. And I have one big crazy, sentimental, geeky heart. By combining all these and putting aside the fear I've always had in asking for what I want, I'm beyond excited to welcome you to the world of <strong><i>STRANGE GENT CANDLE CO.</i></strong></p>
<p>I'm asking for $3,000 to help me get this baby up and running. I feel confident in saying that those of you reading this who have gotten the candles I've made have been big fans of my work. (And not just because they were free!) So now I'm asking, can I get your help? Raising this money will help ease my financial burden and keep me from accruing more debt.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need To Make The Donuts (Candles)</h3>
<p>  <i>Initial Batch of High Grade Organic Oils (the smelly stuff!):  ~$800</i></p>
<p><i>  Initial Batch of High Grade Soy Wax (approximately 200 lbs): ~$200</i></p>

<p><i>  Stamps.Com Set up and account: TBD</i></p>
<p><i>  Rental of work space: ~$150/per month</i></p>
<p>And so on. I'm asking for a little over what I need initially so I can have some reserve, as supplies go quickly. I have to spend money to make money, and as many of you know, that's not always easy. So in my asking you for help, I've got some really amazing perks to hopefully entice you to help this strange gentleman out. Any and every little bit will help.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Your Impact And My Promise</h3>
<p>My candles are made from 100% soy wax, which is better for the environment than beeswax.  I know there are a plethora of candles already out there, but I feel that with my nose, know how, work ethic, good taste, and unique sensibility, I won't fail. As you can see from the pics of my prototypes, these 8oz beauties look pretty darn cool, with an understated, timeless appeal, and burn for up to 40-50 hours, depending on how you care for them.</p>
<p>Even if I don't reach my entire goal, any funding I do get will help, regardless. The good thing about learning from someone (no matter the end result) already in the business, is that I know retailers and wholesalers who would be interested in what I have to offer and are eager to work with me, specifically. I know how to handle projects like this because I've successfully produced plays in both NYC and LA, and, in this endeavor, I'm only responsible for myself and the product. Every project I've ever produced has come in under-budget, and I take people's belief in me seriously.</p>
<p>It's also important for me to keep prices low. Candles aren't a necessity, but they sure can make a difference in your state of mind, as I've learned. By raising this money, it will help me offset market costs, and keep things reasonable for consumers. Some candles cost $2 and some cost $200. I truly believe that you pay for what you get, but $200 is <i>totes crae, bae.</i> I want Strange Gent to be for everybody.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>A Challenge For Any Gent</h3>
<p>I can't lie. Starting any business, big or small, is a huge risk. But I know two things:</p>
<p>1. I make really great candles and have a unique personality that I feel could stand out and be successful.</p>
<p>2. I wouldn't be able to look at myself in the mirror if I let myself quit just because someone stole my work and cheated me out of my money, and more importantly, proper credit.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help A Strange Gent Out</h3>
<p>Even  if you can't help monetarily, you can support by spreading the word to others who like stuff that smells good. Real good. I'm talking real, real, <strong><i>REAL</i></strong> good.</p>

The goal is to visit with activists and organizers as well as directly volunteering in communities with asylum centers in both Munich and Berlin.What We Need & What You GetThe monies earned in this campaign will offset the costs of art and building materials, travel expenses, shipping and insurance, production/construction, and all other fees related to the project. No donation is too big or too small. I would like to provide an incentive to everyone that donates!$5 donations will receive 3""x 3"" sticker with the Unknown Salts logo.$25 or more: Receive a handmade monoprint of the ""Damascus Series"". Each print is painted using a brayer technique, and over layed with a hand drawn tile design. Prints are 10"" x 12""$50 or more: Receive a tshirt with the Unknown Salts Logo. Shirts are white and available in Sm, Med, and Large. Please be sure to mention your size when donating.For contributions over $100  you will receive a sticker, t-shirt, and 16"" x 20"" monoprint of the ""Damascus Series"" pieces. All works are individually created on acid free Rives BFK cotton quality paper.The ImpactYour contributions make all the difference! Its hard to do anything alone with limited resources, but each donation brings me a step further to developing relationships with peoples around the globe.  As an artist, I believe it is my duty to share my talents with communities. Civilizations have been built through creative endeavors, and the social construct is always in flux. Art has had a crucial role in society and is becoming less and less a priority with institutions. Private initiatives still sustain, but are always in need of help from individuals.Risks & ChallengesOne of the greatest challenges regarding this project is being able to create lasting connections. I understand that I am asking questions that may be difficult to discuss.  However, the strengths in this project are those based on communication, respect for cultural nuances, and the acceptance of one another. I firmly believe that through acts of kindness,  the constructs of trust will follow. It is not only the mission to create a visual component, but to integrate myself into the community by volunteering where I am necessary, and developing the project with those that are interested.Other Ways You Can HelpI would like to thank each and every one of you for taking the time to look at my latest endeavor. All donations are appreciated! Feel free to pass this along and share with others! Unknown Salts is a sponsored project of Fractured Atlas, a nonprofit arts service organization. Contributions for the charitable purposes of Unknown Salts must be made payable to Fractured Atlas and are tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

After 13 years of friendship, and fulfilling careers in the entertainment industry, Dion and Dannie have set out on a mission to save and empower the youth of Compton - changing the face of a community and making an impact in the lives of others, using their love and passion for the arts. 


Discover.YOU™ is a youth social justice program focused on providing the youth of Compton an
avenue to connect to what's possible! By exposing youth to Performing Arts classes
(encompassing all genres of dance, acting, choir, musical theatre, creative writing, music production and
engineering), providing a global perspective on life through our mentorship program, and encouraging excellency in the Liberal Arts through our tutoring program, our future leaders will
be set on the path to success and leadership; furthermore, creating powerful change in their
community and around the world. 
Free community workshops (such as Basic Finance, College Prep, Interview Training, Resume Building, Healthy Living, Men's
Leadership, and Women Empowerment) will guide students and their families toward financial
literacy, liberal arts proficiency, healthy living, higher education and entrepreneurship, and self-empowerment! 


Once a month for the past year and a half, we've held our Compton Dance Free Day. An event for youth in the community to enjoy a day of free dance classes taught by working professionals in the entertainment industry. 





Your help makes a difference…








This brand new facility will be the home of Discover.YOU. Students will feel the love and the passion that we feel for them as they enter a home that was made... JUST FOR THEM!
Here we will build brand new performing arts/dance studios, a recording studio where they will train in music engineering and production, and will have a computer/career center for their tutoring and mentoring. 
Located in Compton, on Rosecrans and Central, this center will be readily available and accessible for students and families in the Compton community - providing a safe haven and offering tools that will guide them toward:


Financial Literacy 
Liberal Arts Proficiency 
Healthy Living 
Career Building 
Self-Empowerment




Why we must achieve our goal…

As per-student funding continues to decrease in public schools and the number of arts programs being cut increases, the need for students to be guided, motivated, and encouraged to strive for excellency is more imperative than ever. 
We are empowering, inspiring, and training future CEO’s, business men and women, entrepreneurs, scientists, artists, engineers, law makers, and humanitarians. And this is where we will make it happen!!







Our ways of saying thank you...

Our goal is to raise $500,000 to secure the building that will house our programming!! Your donation not only makes this possible, but also ensures that our program will run for one full year!! Here are a few ways we want to share our appreciation for your contribution:

We must be the change… Currently, the Compton Unified School District has a graduation rate of only 47%; far below that of the overall California graduation rate of 71.2%. 


 Discover.YOU™ fully recognizes the dire need of mentorship and guidance for our youth, and commit to addressing it head on via our workshops for men, women empowerment seminars, leadership events, and one on one mentoring for students.



Our Core Values…


LOVE:: Providing the community a safe haven filled with mentors, artists, and educators who operate solely out of love to inspire our youth, introduce them to a world with endless opportunities, and passionately guide them towards their dreams. We will be love personified.
INTEGRITY:: Helping our youth lay the foundation for their lives; entering into the world with an undeniable focus, maintaining their high standards, understanding and heeding to their moral values, and unable to be easily beset. Their integrity will transcend into their leadership.
FAITH:: Instilling an unshakeable faith whereby our youth will create positive change in their lives, solidify a powerful future that impacts the lives of others, and leave with a better understanding of who they are, where they are going in life, and more importantly how to get there.
EDUCATION:: By offering Performing Arts classes, youth are introduced to a cultural worldview and a broader perspective on what impact they want to leave in the world. Through financial workshops/resume building (for youth and parents), tutor sessions, and mentoring, we educate them on life skills, vigorously prepare them for higher education and entrepreneurship, promote the reduction of the high school dropout and prostitution rates, and guide them through their pursuit of an empowered life.

<h3>About the Project</h3>
<p>I created Construction Zone in a fit of frustration as I tried to navigate dance school as a nonbinary person. Why did everyone assume I was ""in between"" two genders? Why couldn't my teachers get my name right? Why did people assume I was a girl even when I constantly informed them I wasn't? Why was it so much more exciting for my classmates and teachers to see a man on pointe than to see me doing my work? What was the draw of gender bending that made me invisible?</p>
<p>As I realized that my school wasn't going to help me, I reached out to members of my queer/trans communities for help on the project. I had deep discussions about gender and art and lots of help chaining yellow yarn as the project wore on. It wasn't just a chance to make art, I was able to build deeper ties with my community.</p>
<p>I presented the work in a glass room in the center of my school, visible to all. It was an act of defiance and claiming space, not just for me, but for the community that had supported me, and for all nonbinary performers navigating the complexities of cis-dominated spaces. To this day, I still consider it one of my biggest successes. </p>
<p>Now, for the first time, I have the opportunity to present Construction Zone to the public on June 15th at <a href=""https://makeshiftboston.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Make Shift Boston</a>! Make Shift itself regularly supports nonbinary artists and I am so excited to take this opportunity to expand conversations about nonbinary performance beyond the confines of a single dance school in a space which is already doing this work. </p>
<p>Nonbinary dancers live in a lonely world and this is my (OUR) chance to take space, build community, and ask all folks with binary genders to engage with the question of nonbinary performance on nonbinary terms. </p>
<p>This project was born of anger and frustration, but it has become so much more. Please come and join our community!</p>

<h3>Why does this matter?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Trans in dance:</strong> The frustrations I had at my dance school came from the fact that the greater dance community is incredibly transphobic and unwelcoming. Even in inclusive dance spaces, I feel unwelcome and am usually stuck in the uncomfortable position of being the only trans person in the room, an accidental token. <u>I know I am not the only one hurting</u>. In supporting this project, you are giving trans people a chance to make work on our terms, not just for me, but for all the connections that come from incredible, audible trans art.  </p>
<p><strong>Nonbinary performance: </strong>So much of nonbinary performance has been reduced to a binary perspective - someone the audience should perceive as a man with feminine traits, someone the audience should perceive as FAAB (female-assigned at birth) dressed in a nice suit jacket. And SO MUCH of this is done by and for the benfit cis people at the expense of the rich depth and breadth of nonbinary identities. As I develop this project, I will be consulting with other nonbinary performers so it can expand to represent multiple nonbinary identities, not just mine. </p>
<p>In supporting this project, you are giving nonbinary performers a platform to really show you who we are and what we can be. </p>
<p><strong>Supporting Queer Art:</strong> Artists, in general, are underfunded. Queer artists are severely underfunded. As a nonbinary performer, I work multiple jobs with no benefits (no sick days. no vacation. no health insurance) and, again, <u>I know I am not the only one struggling.</u> I am only hiring nonbinary artists, consultants, assistants, and photographers to be part of this project and the space I am renting regularly hires and supports nonbinary artists. In supporting this project, you are not just helping me make art, you are putting money directly towards nurturing and supporting nonbinary artists.</p>
<p><strong>Access to art: </strong>Art costs money, which makes it inaccessible. The work I do is by and for a community that is already struggling financially, so it is deeply important to me to increase access to art by making the event free to all. Even at donation-only events, it's common for there to be pressure to donate a set amount, which can be alienating to folks who can't afford it. With your support, I can keep donations an opt-in only for people who can afford it and you will be making the art world a little more accessible to all. </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge is that I'm young and inexperienced. I've never done anything like this before! But that's also exciting. It's become a chance to talk to more experienced people about producing an event like this, fundraising, and just Making a Thing Happen. I'm learning so much! And, it also means the project's success could have a huge positive impact on my career. </p>

What is Steal A Step? What is contemporary circus?
Steal A Step grew out two movement innovators’ desire to stretch the bounds of American circus and to create ephemeral and authentic experiences for the performer and audience. American circus has been traditionally viewed as clowns, animals, and show girls, but in Europe and Canada contemporary circus is already well established and respected as a mix of circus skill, theater, and dance. It is expected to provoke emotion rather than to focus solely on technical skill.
In trying to apply the lessons of postmodernism to circus, Steal A Step is trying to stretch the bounds of American contemporary circus into performance art through non-linear shows that challenge the rules of settled society and invite the audience to enter the artistic fray. 

Founder Joshua Handal holds a bachelor’s degree in contemporary circus performance from the Ecole de Cirque de Quebec, one of the most prestigious circus arts programs in Northern America. While in Canada, he worked with his trapeze partner Marie to create contemporary and abstract movement on duo trapeze through their brand Duo Josh and Marie. Combining dissonant music with abrupt and often spastic changes in movement, the duo set out to challenge preconceptions in the discipline. Josh also has a degree in mechanical engineering and business from The University of Virginia and is an accomplished pianist and composer.


Founder Jessica John is a circus artist, coach, and choreographer who specializes in aerial rope, fabric, and dance trapeze.

I have been working with clay since middle school but really developed a passion during high school and college in Colorado. I moved to Kansas City with the plan of sharing my work and I am finally doing just that.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/722005/files/20140716120540-IMG_2812.JPG?1405537540"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>For the last year and a half, I worked at an art studio supporting adults with developmental disabilities to create, showcase and sell their work. I was able to introduce them to throwing on the wheel, hand building, altering thrown pieces and so much more. Through teaching them it stirred up my love for clay even more and they have each inspired me to start sharing my own work.</p>
<p>I have been working daily on transforming my basement from a scary dungeon into a bright and colorful ceramic studio. There has been lots of cleaning, painting, organizing and building but I have got almost everything done! The wedging table is ready, the wheel spins smooth like buttah and all the scary spiderwebs are gone. The only thing to make this studio complete is a  kiln to fire work.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/722004/files/20140716120512-IMG_2756.JPG?1405537512"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Currently, I am creating pieces at home then driving across town to fire them at local clay guild. While having access to this kiln has made working from my home studio possible, it raises the chances of breaking pieces during transportation before they are fired. The local clay guild also only fires their work to a temperature that would melt almost all of my pieces if I attempted to do my glaze firings there. At this point, I can fire all of my pieces the first time but then they are left naked with no option to glaze fire them.</p>
<p>With a kiln here, I would be able to fire all of my pieces without transportation for the first (bisque) and glaze firing, have control of the temperature (for no melting and more experimentation), fire my class's work without transportation and widen the variety of options I have for surface decorations.</p>

<div>I never would have thought this campaign would reach its goal on its first day but you guys proved me wrong! Thank you all soooooo much. Since this campaign has passed the goal of funding a kiln I thought it would be nice to let you know how the funds would be used. I am also setting a new goal for $1000! There is definitely still time to make this happen. Currently, thats only $375 away and would mean being able to get all of these things:</div> <ul>
<li>$500 for a used kiln (check!)</li>
<li>Air Purifier $90(check!)</li>
<li>Glazes $300</li>
<li>Throwing Bats $60</li>
<li>Tools $50</li>
<li>Since the initial goal has been reached reached ALL funder will receive an extra handmade perk! </li>

I moved to Kansas City with the plan of sharing my work and I am finally doing just that.  


For the last year and a half, I worked at an art studio supporting adults with developmental disabilities to create, showcase and sell their work. I was able to introduce them to throwing on the wheel, hand building, altering thrown pieces and so much more. Through teaching them it stirred up my love for clay even more and they have each inspired me to start sharing my own work.
I have been working daily on transforming my basement from a scary dungeon into a bright and colorful ceramic studio. There has been lots of cleaning, painting, organizing and building but I have got almost everything done! The wedging table is ready, the wheel spins smooth like buttah and all the scary spiderwebs are gone. The only thing to make this studio complete is a  kiln to fire work.


Currently, I am creating pieces at home then driving across town to fire them at local clay guild. While having access to this kiln has made working from my home studio possible, it raises the chances of breaking pieces during transportation before they are fired. The local clay guild also only fires their work to a temperature that would melt almost all of my pieces if I attempted to do my glaze firings there. At this point, I can fire all of my pieces the first time but then they are left naked with no option to glaze fire them.
With a kiln here, I would be able to fire all of my pieces without transportation for the first (bisque) and glaze firing, have control of the temperature (for no melting and more experimentation), fire my class's work without transportation and widen the variety of options I have for surface decorations.
   What We Need & What You Get
I never would have thought this campaign would reach its goal on its first day but you guys proved me wrong! Thank you all soooooo much. Since this campaign has passed the goal of funding a kiln I thought it would be nice to let you know how the funds would be used. I am also setting a new goal for $1000! There is definitely still time to make this happen. Currently, thats only $375 away and would mean being able to get all of these things: 
$500 for a used kiln (check!)
Air Purifier $90(check!)
Glazes $300
Throwing Bats $60
Tools $50
Since the initial goal has been reached reached ALL funder will receive an extra handmade perk!

<p>Sometimes opportunity is thrust before you by what seems to be completely by chance. </p>
<p>My name is Jody Fallon.  I am an artist working in oils, watercolor, pastels, acrylic and also sculpture.  My wife is Cheryl Fallon a photographic artist. After 12 years of painting full time and 7 years of shlepping work all over Pennsylvania and into New York City, we have been presented with this amazing opportunity to have our very own physical gallery in Lancaster, PA’s Gallery Row neighborhood.  This opportunity was completely unexpected and as such we are not exactly financially prepared, again we are working artists.  We do not have “day jobs” or pensions or any sort of financial assistance.   We have survived and raised our two small boys solely on the fruit of our work.  So….we are having a fundraiser to raise funds to get the gallery set-up and to open the doors.</p>
<p>Those of you how know me personally know that I am passionate about art and the need to share it with everyone.  I have been hosting my own solo art exhibit annually at the Packwood House Museum in Lewisburg for the last 8 years.  These exhibits have been very successful, but now we are ready to have a permanent physical location where I can present not only our work but also the work of artists that I have admired for years, artists that very few people outside of Central Pa have had the opportunity to view.</p>

<p>We will be opening the doors on August 3rd.  The gallery is located at 113 North Water Street, Lancaster, PA.  </p>

<h3>About our project</h3>
<p><strong>Art Prizes</strong> and festivals are the life blood of most artist's practices now that so many art galleries are closing. That's why, you want to improve your chances of winning by having much more time to get ready for your favourite art prizes. If you just rely on ""Call for Entries"" in magazines and newspapers and you miss the ad does that mean you are going to lose out? <strong>Not if you are using the Art Prizes website.</strong> We give you dates and information about forthcoming prizes well in advance of the ""Call for Entries"". With our Watchlist and Add-to-Calendar buttons you can keep tabs on all the prizes that interest you and not worry about missing ads in the journals. <a href=""http://bit.ly/QWH9Vg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Art Prizes website"">Click here</a> to see a brief video of how this works on our current site.</p>
<p>And, we are doing all this right now, in Australia! Now we want to help you no matter what country you live in. Two years ago I built Art Prizes Australia from scratch and now it enjoys the patronage of over 6,000 artists and photographers.</p>
<p>But what about the fabulous art prizes available to artists in America, Europe, Asia? Help me raise the funds to produce a website, pdf magazine and each year a printed magazine which will feature the best and most interesting prizes and festivals around the world.</p>
<p>If you are an artist you will be able to see</p>

</div></div>","THE STORY OF ""THE NEXT THING"" (TNT)
 
The
Next Thing: Art in the 21st Century is a
collection of illustrated essays written by a broad range of world renowned
artists and theorists all attempting to anticipate the aesthetic sensibility
that will define our century.
 
Edited
by fiction writer and theorist Pablo Baler, the book will come out in September
2012, published by Rowman & Littlefield under the Fairleigh Dickinson
University Press imprint.
 
The
list of contributors include: Stelarc (Australia), Salima Hashmi (Pakistan),
Liliana Porter (Argentina/U.S.), Ana Tiscornia (Uruguay/U.S.), Mieke Bal
(Neatherlands), Sue ""Johnny"" Golding (England), Glenn Harper (U.S.),
 Polona Tratnik (Slovenia), Jan Castro (U.S.), Peng Feng (China), Hagi
Kenaan (Israel), Mark Axelrod (U.S.)
 
Among
those involved in this book, The Next Thing was quickly nicknamed ""TNT""... not only a good sounding acronym but also a reflection on our confidence on
the explosive nature of this project and its promise as one of the major editorial
events of the century.
 
  
THE IMPACT
This
international anthology examines current artistic manifestations: from ""post-human"" installations, to transgenic experimentations, from tele-presence
performance, to nano-design, virtual urbanism or ""guerilla art"", to name but a
few contemporary tendencies that are redefining both the boundaries of Meaning
and what it means to be Human in the 21st century. 

Indeed, The Next Thing will
become a unique forum for current critical discussions about contemporary art and
will also be a reference point for artists and thinkers of the future. The
Next Thing will not only offer a high quality visual gateway into
the work of contemporary trailblazing artists but it will also provide an
interdisciplinary framework to examine the intellectual and emotional
underpinnings of our current revolution in the Arts.
 
 
What We Need & What You Get
If you read this far, YOU are the one we are counting on...
Art
has always relied on those who not only shared the vision but also were able to
support it. We intend to turn this book about contemporary and future art into
an art object itself both in terms of the scope of its writing and the high
quality of its illustrations. In order to achieve this goal we are raising
$15,000 (for production costs) and are asking the endorsement of people like
you who are intrigued by these sweeping changes in the world of art, and who
cherish the value of a thoughtful and beautiful art book.
 
A group of institutions have already pledged their support to this publication (we are still waiting on some others) so we don't need to achieve the full $15,000 through this Indiegogo campaign. Among these institutions, we can currently list:



College
of Arts and Letters, 
California State University, Los Angeles.
$2,000
John
Fowles Center for Creative Writing, 
Chapman University.
$500
Oldenborg
Center, 
Pomona College.
$750
The Gould Center for Humanistic Studies,
Claremont McKenna College
$1,500
And from a group a private funders
$1,000





So we are aiming at raising at least another $5,000 through this campaign


Other Ways You Can Help
Please share this project with friends and family. Help us spread the word... and be part of the future!

Summary</b></p>
<p>I
am Mwiza Nyirenda,a Malawian film maker and social rights activist. In 2013 I completed the film,<i>Umunthu</i>, a 30 minute first
person documentary on homosexuality in Malawi that investigates the
complexities of tolerance, acceptance and culture in relationship LGBTQ rights.</p>
<p><i>Umunthu </i>has been selected for the Boston
International Film Festival (BIFF),taking place April 11-21st. Attending this festival, and the
screening of <i>Umunthu</i> is integrally important to the continued dialogue
surrounding this human rights issue, on both a national and international
scope. Presenting, screening and discussing <i>Umunthu</i> throughout Boston will help
give voice to a perspective that is rarely heard, and needs to be heard,
regarding the issue of homosexuality and how it is perceived in an African
country. I anticipate meeting with several stake holders that will further our
screening efforts in Malawi and in other countries throughout Africa as a
result of attending this festival. It is also an amazing opportunity as a
burgeoning artist to attend such a festival for networking, and to further
develop my voice and abilities as a social change advocate.</p>
<p>In
addition to the screening at BIFF
I intend to screen the film,and
host a panel discussion, at Harvard University in conjunction with Still
Harbor. I will also leverage this opportunity to intern with internationally
recognized film maker, and Executive Director of BIFF, Patrick Jerome.</p>
<p><span>In conjunction with this campaign, I am also seeking
funding for this trip through the Prince Claus Fund and individual donors. Even
if the full amount is not raised on Indigogo I am hopeful that I will still be
able to attend the festival, but I need your help in making it possible! If we
raise more than we expect, the additional funds will go to help bring Executive
Director, Galia Boneh to Boston as well.</span></p>
<p><b><span>What We Need &amp; What You Get</span></b></p>

<p><b><span>The Impact</span></b></p>
<p>The
issue of homosexuality is divisive not only in Malawi but worldwide, and much
of the debate has focused on African countries. In some African countries, such
as Uganda and Nigeria, anti-gay movements are becoming increasingly influential
on the state and the public. What the American and European public do not
understand is that anti-gay campaigns are often perceived as acts of resistance
to European and American dominance, and the public in some African countries is
not as unanimously homophobic as they appear to be on the media. <i>Umunthu </i>presents how the issue is perceived and
discussed in the Malawian context,<span>and tries to shape an African response
towards the issue of homosexuality through an indigenous pan African concept of <i>Umunthu</i>-
which simply means <i>I
am because we are. </i>It
presents a variety of opinions, and shows how and why the issue becomes too politicized and emotionally charged.</span></p>
<p>The opportunity to screen the film, <i>Umunthu</i> for an international audience
not only provides a rare chance for that audience to hear an African voice, but
also challenges the image of Africa perpetuated by western
media as a homophobic continent. Earlier this year,<i>Umunthu </i>was screened at the Pan
African Film Festival in Los Angeles (<a href=""http://www.paff.org/filmfest/2014-films/umunthu-an-african-response-to-homosexuality/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.paff.org/filmfest/2014-films/umunthu-an-african-response-to-homosexuality/</a>).
The audience at the festival expressed the feeling that the film challenges
negative attitudes towards Africa.</p>
<p>Screening <i>Umunthu </i>at the Boston International Film
Festival, Harvard University and other spaces in Boston and New York serves as a continuation of the film's goal to create
sober platforms to discuss the issue of LGBTQ rights. Its not only about offering an
African perspective to the ongoing discussion of the issue--but creating a cross-cultural exchange
of ideas, moving towards a place of tolerance and acceptance for all.</p>
<p>In
Malawi,<i>Umunthu</i>, as part of the UP program,at the
Art &amp; Global Health Centre Africa, has been screened in seven colleges. The
following article demonstrates the discourse it has initiated: <a href=""http://www.nyasatimes.com/2013/10/30/chanco-graduates-film-umunthu-revamps-debate-on-gays-in-malawi/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.nyasatimes.com/2013/10/30/chanco-graduates-film-umunthu-revamps-debate-on-gays-in-malawi/</a></p>

Namaste! We are Cirello Metalsmith. Two lovers connected under one passion - a vision to inspire positive intention through authentic, quality hand-made art.


Matthew Cirello has been making jewelry for over 10 years. Finding his passion while studying at Humbolt State University, his career started in 2007 as a studio artist of Spanish Village Art Center in San Diego, California. In 2008 he opened his first retail gallery with working studios where he met me, Jasmine, in 2009.

Custom ""Spirit"" pendant in process by Jasmine.

Jasmine and Matthew in the gallery/studio.

We worked together
selling and curating the works of other local talent while growing creatively and romantically closer. After five and a half years of managing a public space and developing the surrounding artist community, we have represented over 30 artists and participated in over 60 consecutive monthly art walks. This September we closed the gallery and moved our studio to our ranch in Jamul.




Many San Diego based artists were represented in our gallery showroom.


New studio in Jamul!




Our fundraising kick-off is just the beginning of our new chapter. Inspired by the creative community of Black Rock City, our experience at Burning Man 2014 solidified our commitment to serving our true life's passion together. And living it right now. But we cannot do it alone. We need the help of our surrounding community. You!


By donating to this project you will be supporting the arts as a viable part of society and spreading the power of positive collective conscious action.

thought, collectors obtain a “miniature time-capsule”
expressing this intention into the future. Empowering us to share the messages of Love that come from
honoring our collective Spirit each piece contains a story, a
way of life, which can be appreciated through these wearable artworks and passed down over
generations to come.





  Risks & Challenges
As
with any endeavor there are always challenges that may arise. Of course, we
need to be aware that things may not always go as planned. Honestly,
we have already experienced so many trials. Opening a high-end, retail art gallery was not an easy task and letting it go proved to be even more difficult.



It is our hope that if we continue telling our story and
working towards our goals we will inspire others to become involved because
they believe in what we have to offer. And of course, by being adaptable and
thinking of creative solutions to produce the most beneficial result, we always
overcome.

As long as we stay true to what we’ve created we know we will
succeed. We can promise you, when it comes to growth there is no stopping us. We
are inspiring the world through art.

<span style="""">Summary</span><br/>
</h3> <p>I'm an artist and a teacher. I've been invited to be one of five artists participating in an artist residency in Wolfville, Nova Scotia this summer. With local scientists and experts, we will explore the Bay of Fundy region, home to the world's biggest tides, amazing fossils, and a host of Canadian wildlife. </p>
<p><i>Biophilia</i> is open to artists who explore natural themes in their work. Attending artists will have time to work on individual projects while also getting valuable time to collaborate with each other. We will also work with experts in astronomy, biology, botany, mycology, and geology, gaining insight and inspiration for future projects. I'm so excited to see new landscapes, including some ancient sea beds and fossils I've never viewed in real life. I'll be exploring the topography and how the flora and fauna settle into it, looking for ways to extend my work. The residency will also give me great connections with like-minded artists, and who knows where that can lead.</p>
<p>This is a terrific opportunity for me to push my work further. I have three significant gallery shows in 2015-16, including my first solo show. This residency is a perfect catalyst for the work I'll need to complete in the next few months. </p> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need and How Much it Costs</h3> <p>I've never been to Nova Scotia. One thing I've discovered is it's about as far away from SW Oregon as a body can get in North America before ending up in Greenland. I have travel and residency expenses to cover:</p> <ul>
<li>$1000 residency fee to pay for residency expenses</li> <li>$1100 airfare (RT Portland to Halifax)</li> <li>$535 for lodging during travel to and from the residency</li>
<li>$100 for ground transportation and meals not covered by residency</li> </ul>
<div>Total funding needed: $2735</div>
<div>I'm eligible for up to $1500 from a faculty professional development fund via my college. I've applied for this grant, but receiving it isn't a certainty and it won't cover the entire expense. There are no other applicable grant opportunities at this time, so I'm looking to raise the funds via my work.</div>
<div>What's in it for you? No chocolate bars or wrapping paper here--you'll get art! All funds will be used to pay for the residency and the production/shipping of thank you gifts. Any additional funds will go towards printing and framing works from the residency for exhibition.</div>

During the event, we will be doing nails for guests attending, as well as hosting as much as we can manage in between doing the nails..

I've come up with a way for people to afford their favorite piece of artwork... NO MATTER HOW EXPENSIVE IT IS.

I've created a bridge between the artist and the community, and I want to share it with you. I want to tell you my dream and what i'm doing to make it come true. This is an endeavor straight from the heart, to help better the world we live in and bring communities together.**Two Lane Black-Top to Paradise is a cross-country project with a mission to help in the growth and strengthen local artist communities throughout the United States by helping them engage with the community around them to gain more support, all through... NAIL ART.**The road-trip kicks off Saturday, April 26th in Oceanside, CA, at The Hill Street Country Club art gallery. The trip will be a little over a month long. At each location on our itinerary, we will be staying for a MINIMUM of two days where an event has been scheduled with 78 West Collective. During the days prior to the event, we will be applying nail art appliqués of the artist being showcased, for event promotors and guests who have confirmed their attendance to the event. We will provide artists and promoters with photos of the nails showcasing the art being featured during the event. The purpose behind this is to raise awareness and excite the community for the upcoming event. During the event, we will be doing nails for guests attending, as well as hosting as much as we can manage in between doing the nails.. After the event has finished, proceeds will be split, we will retire to bed, perhaps some breakfast the following morning and some proper goodbyes to send us off to the next destination.

<h3>Project Background</h3>
<p>Warnayaka Art represents nationally and internationally acclaimed painters (e.g. Lily Nungarrayi Hargraves, Judy Napangardi Martin, Rosie Napurrurla Tasman and many more). Our new project is building on this impressive artistic legacy by providing a platform for a new generation of talented, young artists, many of whom are seeking new forms of expression in new media technologies.</p>
<p>YAMA, the Warlpiri word for 'reflection' or 'mirror', is an experimental project combining elements of new media, digital art, and installation with traditional indigenous artforms of song, ceremonial dance, and Jukurrpa (dreaming) painting.</p>
<p>YAMA, is a collaboration between Warnayaka Art Centre (especially younger artists like Isaiah Jungarrayi Lewis, Neil Jupurrurla Cooke, Sharon Nampijinpa Anderson, and Rebecca Napanangka Farrell), the Lajamanu community, and key external collaborating artists, like German-based, Australian artist Gretta Louw. The project will result in a large-scale multimedia installation, along with a new body of digital, video, and printed works that will be exhibited throughout Australia and overseas.</p>
<p>The project has already received partial sponsorship from the highly competitive Australia Council Indigenous Experimental Art Forms fund - but we need your help to raise the additional funding we need to fulfill the project's potential to be a truly landmark work in indigenous Australian art, as well as digital and new media art worldwide.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Specifics</h3>
In this initial round of fundraising, we need to raise funds to send the two lead Lajamanu artists - Isaiah Jungarrayi Lewis and Neil Jupurrurla Cooke - on their first trip overseas! The artists, with art centre Manager Louisa Erglis, are heading to Germany for a two-week intensive video and digital art workshop with multimedia artist, Gretta Louw. The trip will include visits to new media and video exhibitions, meetings with industry contacts, and of course lots of work with video cameras and video editing suites!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In return for your support, we are offering lots of great incentives - you can have your own piece of Lajamanu art for an affordable price, or pick up Warnayaka's recently released book and DVD 'Warnayaka Art Centre: Life in the Digital Desert' (the art centre's first publication!).</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Every little bit helps, and we - and all the artists at Warnayaka Art Centre - appreciate not only your contributions but also your sharing our campaign with your networks.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Should we raise more than the stated target (fingers crossed!), the money will go towards much needed additional, on-site media and technology training opportunities for Lajamanu artists, and purchasing necessary audiovisual equipment for the art centre. We want the new generation of indigenous artists to have the skills and equipment they need to be able to express their traditional and contemporary stories in any medium they choose, and to lead the new charge of indigenous, digital art!</div></div>","Project Background

</div><p></p><h3>About the ""Free to Form"" Project</h3>Hi! I'm Lex Casciato - the artist and creator behind the ""Free to Form"" Project. The ""Free to Form"" Project consists of eight unique, mixed-media mannequins each displaying a different stage in which an exploited victim experiences through their trafficking. By combining these eight mannequins into one grouped exhibit, my mission is to showcase the effects that human trafficking has on its victims, while also:<p></p><p>             - educating our society on and spreading awareness of sex trafficking, CSEC                       (commercial sexual exploitation of children), and the manifestation of                            trauma from abuse</p><p>             - sharing with our world solutions on how to abolish trafficking and how we                         can help victims of abuse and trauma</p><p>             - giving a voice to the voiceless by bringing to light an under-served epidemic                       and the victims it creates</p><p></p><ul><li>This campaign is important to me, because I believe that every human was created to be free. As long as there are people enslaved and exploited, we have a responsibility to help free others. </li></ul><ul><li>As a contributor to this project, you will be spreading awareness of sex trafficking on our own local streets, helping sexually exploited youth by giving them a voice and a donation, and aiding in trafficking-prevention -- all with the overarching goal of us working as a community to abolish trafficking altogether.</li></ul><br/><h3>What Does ""Free to Form"" Mean?</h3><p></p><p>I started using the phrase “Free to Form” to represent a positive take on the concept of non-conformity — but avoiding “non” and “anti.”  “Free to Form” implies that we are all created equal, and we were created to be free — slaves to no one and to nothing, free from pain, fear, addictions, etc. We also have the freedom to form groups and communities together, to form theories, ideas, thoughts, and concepts, and to form into our unique selves. Human trafficking victims lose this freedom, which is why it is so important that we continue to shed light on this wide-ranging problem.</p><p></p><h3>What Your Contributions Mean</h3>Over the past 15 months, I've completed two of the eight mannequins in the series, with others in progress. The candy-coated mannequin and mosaiced mirror mannequin have cost approximately $500. Your contributions will allow me to finish the remaining six in the series and will be primarily used for the following:<p></p><ul><li>The bulk of the $1,250 in contributions will be used for material costs for the remaining six mannequins in the series. It's amazing how quickly mannequins, hot glue, resin, glass, grout, metal bits n' bobs, paint, and such add up! </li></ul><ul><li>Additionally, your contributions will assist with marketing materials to promote the series and transportation costs to physically get these mannequins into galleries where more and more people will be able to experience the installation and the message will get disseminated further and further.</li></ul><ul><li>The remaining costs will be to satisfy rewards and for Indiegogo fees.</li></ul><ul><li>In the circumstance that the full goal is not reached, I will complete what I can of the mannequin series. This final mannequins will be presented at this year's GirlFestNW - a concert designed to spotlight female musician and artists - on September 27th.</li></ul><div>
<b><h3>What You Get in Return</h3></b><p></p>I am SO stoked to offer some amazing rewards for your donations!!! As a contributor, you are helping spread awareness of sex trafficking on our own, local streets and helping sexually exploited youth by giving them a voice. In addition: </div><p></p><ul><li>Every donor gets their name listed in the ""Free to Form"" brochure which will be handed out as part of the showcase as well as social media shout-outs!</li></ul><ul><li>Additional perks range from getting a special ""Mad-Lib"" style email to a Health and Wellness consultation from a professional Master Herbalist to a one-of-a-kind stained glass mannequin that can be lit from behind to add some glowing vibes to your life! </li></ul><ul><li>As an additional perk, donors get the satisfaction knowing that 10% of proceeds will be donated to the Sexual Assault Resource Center (SARC) - a non-profit helping to fight CSEC (for more info: <a href=""http://sarcoregon.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://sarcoregon.org/</a>)</li></ul><ul><li>The rewards share the ""Free to Form"" theme which represents that all individuals ought to experience freedom. These perks offer inspiration, beauty, healing, and gratitude that are designed to contribute to your joy, vitality, and motivation in life!</li></ul><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3>""Free to Form"" has already been asked to premiere at this year's GirlFestNW in Portland, OR on September 27th, 2015. This showcase will open up conversation around the subjects of sex trafficking, CSEC, abuse, and trauma.

But the real challenges are:<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>1) Finding affordable ways to complete this project:</b></p>
<p>I have completed two of the eight mannequins, already spending $500 of my own non-profit job money, so the major challenge I face is coming up with the financing to complete the other six mannequins in the series.</p>
<p><br/><b>2) Learning how to use new mediums:</b></p>
<p>I have never worked with moss/plants, metal, and candy in an art project, so each mannequin I work on has its own set of unique challenges. For example, you need a different type of glue for metal than you do for glue.</p>
<p><br/><b>3) Getting its message disseminated through showcases:</b></p>
<p>I have already developed a plan for showcasing my ""Free to Form"" series once all eight are completed. The first showcase will be at this year's GirlFestNW event in Portland, OR. I have also been in discussions with other resources to display the finished line of mannequins.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Whether or not you are able to contribute financially, there are still amazing ways you can get involved:</p>
<ul><li>Share my project using Indiegogo's share tools and on social media! The more people who know, the merrier! I'm trying to spread a powerful message out into the world about this topic, and the more people who share, the more people will be informed.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Donate your old clothes to a local non-profit or shelter working with sexually exploited or homeless youth and/or adults or your local abuse resource center. These places are also in constant need for new underwear, bras, and socks, due to clothing items being taken as evidence in sexual assault cases. Donating gift cards to such facilities is also hugely helpful for the victims of exploitation, abuse, and trauma.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Volunteer :) Money helps, but giving your valuable time is life changing! Find something you're passionate about or think about the problem that bothers you the most, and volunteer to help make a difference. Your voice, your time, and your actions are powerful!!</li></ul>
<ul><li>Donate materials or your ""mutilated dollar"" as materials to this project :) Message me on my Facebook page for more info (link below)</li></ul>

</div></div>","About the ""Free to Form"" ProjectHi! I'm Lex Casciato - the artist and creator behind the ""Free to Form"" Project. The ""Free to Form"" Project consists of eight unique, mixed-media mannequins each displaying a different stage in which an exploited victim experiences through their trafficking. By combining these eight mannequins into one grouped exhibit, my mission is to showcase the effects that human trafficking has on its victims, while also:             - educating our society on and spreading awareness of sex trafficking, CSEC                       (commercial sexual exploitation of children), and the manifestation of                            trauma from abuse             - sharing with our world solutions on how to abolish trafficking and how we                         can help victims of abuse and trauma             - giving a voice to the voiceless by bringing to light an under-served epidemic                       and the victims it createsThis campaign is important to me, because I believe that every human was created to be free. As long as there are people enslaved and exploited, we have a responsibility to help free others. As a contributor to this project, you will be spreading awareness of sex trafficking on our own local streets, helping sexually exploited youth by giving them a voice and a donation, and aiding in trafficking-prevention -- all with the overarching goal of us working as a community to abolish trafficking altogether.What Does ""Free to Form"" Mean?I started using the phrase “Free to Form” to represent a positive take on the concept of non-conformity — but avoiding “non” and “anti.”  “Free to Form” implies that we are all created equal, and we were created to be free — slaves to no one and to nothing, free from pain, fear, addictions, etc. We also have the freedom to form groups and communities together, to form theories, ideas, thoughts, and concepts, and to form into our unique selves. Human trafficking victims lose this freedom, which is why it is so important that we continue to shed light on this wide-ranging problem.What Your Contributions MeanOver the past 15 months, I've completed two of the eight mannequins in the series, with others in progress. The candy-coated mannequin and mosaiced mirror mannequin have cost approximately $500. Your contributions will allow me to finish the remaining six in the series and will be primarily used for the following:The bulk of the $1,250 in contributions will be used for material costs for the remaining six mannequins in the series. It's amazing how quickly mannequins, hot glue, resin, glass, grout, metal bits n' bobs, paint, and such add up! Additionally, your contributions will assist with marketing materials to promote the series and transportation costs to physically get these mannequins into galleries where more and more people will be able to experience the installation and the message will get disseminated further and further.The remaining costs will be to satisfy rewards and for Indiegogo fees.In the circumstance that the full goal is not reached, I will complete what I can of the mannequin series. This final mannequins will be presented at this year's GirlFestNW - a concert designed to spotlight female musician and artists - on September 27th.
What You Get in ReturnI am SO stoked to offer some amazing rewards for your donations!!! As a contributor, you are helping spread awareness of sex trafficking on our own, local streets and helping sexually exploited youth by giving them a voice. In addition: Every donor gets their name listed in the ""Free to Form"" brochure which will be handed out as part of the showcase as well as social media shout-outs!Additional perks range from getting a special ""Mad-Lib"" style email to a Health and Wellness consultation from a professional Master Herbalist to a one-of-a-kind stained glass mannequin that can be lit from behind to add some glowing vibes to your life! As an additional perk, donors get the satisfaction knowing that 10% of proceeds will be donated to the Sexual Assault Resource Center (SARC) - a non-profit helping to fight CSEC (for more info: http://sarcoregon.org/)The rewards share the ""Free to Form"" theme which represents that all individuals ought to experience freedom. These perks offer inspiration, beauty, healing, and gratitude that are designed to contribute to your joy, vitality, and motivation in life!The Impact""Free to Form"" has already been asked to premiere at this year's GirlFestNW in Portland, OR on September 27th, 2015. This showcase will open up conversation around the subjects of sex trafficking, CSEC, abuse, and trauma. The overall goal is to educate our communities and spread awareness in order to learn how to help victims and create measures, systems, and support networks in our cities and globe to eventually abolish this modern form of slavery.If fully funded, there will be eight mannequins in this series. The eight mannequins in the series focus on different stages in the sex trafficking process for the victim. Each mannequin will be comprised of a different art medium. These mediums are:             1. Candy - representing the viewing of a victim as a pleasure object                   * completed*             2. Mutilated Dollars - depicting payment for a victim's body for another's                          satisfaction * in progress *             3. Paint - showing the different abuses a sexual assault and/or trafficked                            victim experiences * in progress *             4. Broken Mirrors - expressing the fracturing of one's identity and psyche as                    a result of continual trauma and abuse * completed *             5. Metal - depicting the hardened exterior one develops to protect oneself                          from further abuse and trauma * in progress *             6. Fabric/Embroidery - representing assembling our brokenness into                                   something stronger and more beautiful * in pre-production *             7. Moss/Plants - representing growth, healing, rejuvenation * in progress *             8.  Stained Glass - exhibiting that while we all have our own stains, the light                       (the good) can still shine through us * in progress *Risks & ChallengesSo far, some of the challenges I have faced are hot glue gun burns and my hamster trying to eat my candy mannequin.

<h2>Shapeshifters is Expanded Cinema</h2>
<p>Shapeshifters Cinema highlights the work of experimental artists working in “expanded cinema,” a term that encompasses a wide range of exploratory practices that transgress the boundaries separating media. All programs in the Shapeshifters series feature a live presentation of (or about) the moving image with music or sound art and other live performative elements. Some part of the presented work is expected to be created live, with a certain element of improvisation. This might include a score or sound track created live from composed or found material, the manipulation of imagery as it is projected, live interaction with audio or visuals or any number of other possible actions. In this way, each Shapeshifters presentation is a unique experience, for both artist and audience.</p>
<h2>About the Series</h2>
<p>Shapeshifters programs are presented free of charge on the second Sunday evening of every month at the Temescal Art Center in North Oakland. The series is curated and administered by Gilbert Guerrero and Kathleen Quillian, both long time participants in the Bay Area media arts community with close ties to Artists’ Television Access, San Francisco Cinematheque, the Illuminated Corridor and Temescal Street Cinema.</p>
<p>Since we started in May of 2012, Shapeshifters has presented 12 programs by local, notable artists working in the field, including the <strong>cinepimps</strong> (featuring filmmakers <strong>Alfonso Alvarez</strong> and <strong>Keith Arnold</strong> with musicians <strong>Suki O’Kane</strong> and <strong>Wayne Grim</strong>), filmmaker <strong>Paul Clipson</strong> with musician <strong>Evan Caminiti</strong>, animator/musician <strong>Jeremy Rourke</strong>, filmmaker <strong>Kerry Laitala</strong> with musician/filmmaker <strong>John Davis</strong> and collaborator <strong>Neal Johnson</strong>, video-poet <strong>Tommy Becker</strong>, filmmaker <strong>Sylvia Schedelbauer</strong>, filmmaker/musician <strong>John Davis</strong> with sound artist/musician <strong>Josh Churchill</strong>, video/performance artist <strong>Jen Cohen</strong> with sound/performance artist <strong>Guillermo Galindo</strong>, analog media artist <strong>Lori Varga</strong> &amp; filmmaker <strong>Paul Baker</strong>, multimedia artist <strong>Jim Haynes</strong>, multi-dimensional provacateur <strong>Josh Kit Clayton</strong> and film/sound makers <strong>Beige</strong>. And we have many more superb artists lined up to present over the coming months. Find out more about past and future shows on our web site: <a href=""http://shapeshifterscinema.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://shapeshifterscinema.com/</a></p>
<h2>How Your Contribution Will Help</h2>
<p>Shapeshifters has been largely a self-funded project (meaning, most expenses are paid out of our own pockets) with the help of small donations given here and there. We've come to recognize that this does not shake out to be a very sustainable business model. Each show costs us about $200 to put on--not a lot, but more than we can afford every month as working artists ourselves. So we are turning to our community for help!</p>
<p>The majority of funds raised in this campaign will go toward stipends for the artists who present in the series because we believe all artists should be paid for what they do. The rest of the funds will go toward rental of the Temescal Art Center and miscellaneous supplies needed to keep the show running. </p>
<h2>Thank you!</h2>
<p>Thank you for supporting Shapeshifters Cinema! We look forward to continuing the series to highlight the many artists working in this dynamic and evolving field. With your support we can keep it going. </p>

</div></div>","Shapeshifters is Expanded Cinema
Shapeshifters Cinema highlights the work of experimental artists working in “expanded cinema,” a term that encompasses a wide range of exploratory practices that transgress the boundaries separating media. All programs in the Shapeshifters series feature a live presentation of (or about) the moving image with music or sound art and other live performative elements. Some part of the presented work is expected to be created live, with a certain element of improvisation. This might include a score or sound track created live from composed or found material, the manipulation of imagery as it is projected, live interaction with audio or visuals or any number of other possible actions. In this way, each Shapeshifters presentation is a unique experience, for both artist and audience.
About the Series
Shapeshifters programs are presented free of charge on the second Sunday evening of every month at the Temescal Art Center in North Oakland. The series is curated and administered by Gilbert Guerrero and Kathleen Quillian, both long time participants in the Bay Area media arts community with close ties to Artists’ Television Access, San Francisco Cinematheque, the Illuminated Corridor and Temescal Street Cinema.
Since we started in May of 2012, Shapeshifters has presented 12 programs by local, notable artists working in the field, including the cinepimps (featuring filmmakers Alfonso Alvarez and Keith Arnold with musicians Suki O’Kane and Wayne Grim), filmmaker Paul Clipson with musician Evan Caminiti, animator/musician Jeremy Rourke, filmmaker Kerry Laitala with musician/filmmaker John Davis and collaborator Neal Johnson, video-poet Tommy Becker, filmmaker Sylvia Schedelbauer, filmmaker/musician John Davis with sound artist/musician Josh Churchill, video/performance artist Jen Cohen with sound/performance artist Guillermo Galindo, analog media artist Lori Varga & filmmaker Paul Baker, multimedia artist Jim Haynes, multi-dimensional provacateur Josh Kit Clayton and film/sound makers Beige. And we have many more superb artists lined up to present over the coming months. Find out more about past and future shows on our web site: http://shapeshifterscinema.com/
How Your Contribution Will Help
Shapeshifters has been largely a self-funded project (meaning, most expenses are paid out of our own pockets) with the help of small donations given here and there. We've come to recognize that this does not shake out to be a very sustainable business model. Each show costs us about $200 to put on--not a lot, but more than we can afford every month as working artists ourselves. So we are turning to our community for help!
The majority of funds raised in this campaign will go toward stipends for the artists who present in the series because we believe all artists should be paid for what they do. The rest of the funds will go toward rental of the Temescal Art Center and miscellaneous supplies needed to keep the show running. 
Thank you!
Thank you for supporting Shapeshifters Cinema! We look forward to continuing the series to highlight the many artists working in this dynamic and evolving field. With your support we can keep it going. 
We have a bunch of fun, hand made gifts to give you in return for your generous donation including post cards, tote bags, T-shirts a DVD compilation and an exclusive film, food and craft beer salon!

My name is Matt Schaefer.

I attended grad school at the University of Kansas
I currently run a gallery in a small town, Aberdeen South Dakota
For 3 years I have been actively promoting emerging artists and using social media to do so.

I have many contacts through this social media network I have created and look to bypass the ""who you know"" element of art galleries and offer the best art there is to the public regardless of name.


What We Need & What You Get
Due to this being a small town, I can't offer the best there is in art due to population size, money available, local aesthetics.

For around $5000 plus everything else I have, I know I can open a quality space in a larger city, to compete with other galleries.
The difference between myself and other gallery is that I am an artist as well. I keep the commission structure down to make the art both affordable and give the artist most the profits for the sale. (they made it, so why not?)
If I do not make my goal, the funds will go to the artists of my gallery.



The Impact
The Impact will be that many emerging artists will get their chance, both national and international, to hang in a gallery in a major city.

It will get unknown artists names out.
My gallery currently and my social media presence already promotes this ethos.
I'm already doing this, but I'm asking for help to transform this into it's full potential.



Other Ways You Can Help
Some people just can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean they can’t help:

If you can't give, share this with as many people as possible
Indiegogo share tools!

We began growing ""muffstaches"" or moustaches out of our pubic hair, in the fall of 2012. Over the past year, we shot a series of pin-up style (i.e. sorta sexy, kinda cheesy, and Not Pornographic!) photos featuring our pubic coifs, and incorporated them into a unique and professionally designed calendar.

<ul>
<li>A large assortment of lumber, including structural elements</li>
<li>A scaffold and/or lift system for safely building and placing the roof sections</li>
<li>Power and fuel, both for the construction portion, and for the burn</li>
<li>CNC routering for the decorative screen sections of the walls</li>
<li>Metal hardware to ensure the structure is safe and secure for all attendees</li>
<li>Transportation costs for all equipment, hardware, and building supplies during prefabrication</li>

Title: Could it be?  36""x48""x2.5""  This painting has a dual french cleat system on the back and was painted compositionally to work hung as you see it here or flipped 180 degrees. This is the TOP perk on the list!

MY WHY
The work I create in Finland will be brought back and installed as part of a group exhibit titled ""Noisemakers"" an Art's Fund Raiser for the Norman Arts Council. I'll be presenting a video projection mapped sculpture as well as physical works for purchase. Opening reception is December 13 at Mainsite Contemporary Art in Norman, Oklahoma. 


Hello, 



My name is Chad Mount and I'm a visual artist and I am honored to announce the renowned international art residency program Arteles recently selected me as one of eight artists chosen among hundreds of applicants from around the world to participate in their November 2013 artist in residency program. This is my first art residency to participate in, As a resident in Haukijarvi, Finland, I will paint my unique blend visual constellations(Blooming Currents), capturing the process in HD video. Then using a combination of video mapping software I'll be able to project these ""Blooming Currents"" seamlessly across unconventional three dimensional forms evoking wondrous illusions. Working in Finland will give me the unique opportunity to delve into landscapes of snow and forests, lands foreign to where I typically pull my inspiration which is largely from the ocean. I also pull much inspiration from the celestial and am fascinated by the almost symbiotic relationship between the celestial and the aquatic. 
I aim to capture the parallels of these two realms, and hopefully raising the emotional state and sense of wonder in the viewer.  I have no doubt that exploring Finland's winter landscape especially at night with the snow covered landscape backlit by a clear open sky caressed by the occasional wafting northern lights, will inspire new motifs in my work and I'm am ecstatic about that idea! My process in creating these anomalies uses the pooling of composition colors via underpainting, combined with my own unique chemical blend of solvents and emulsifiers. I'm currently experimenting Cymatics in part if the creation process which has added another exciting layer to this painting process. Arteles has two Reed Organs and I've already been dreaming up ways of incorporating their haunting sounds into my creations while there.

If JD accepts the challenge the funds may only be used toward the production of the new designs and art supplies to help the process and $1 of every $20 will go to Project Anti-Bully in addition to the proceeds of the 5th design.  If he doesn't accept, all of the funds raised will go to Project Anti-Bully outside of the cost of taxes, campaign fees, and providing incentives. I chose Project Anti-Bully because they are international and run for students by students.  Also, JD was bullied as a kid, making him the sensitive and thoughtful person he is today.  I hope knowing that he can help raise awareness against bullying will make him more likely to accept the challenge, but either way your donations will go toward a statement of furthering kindness through acceptance.  </p><p>I am intentionally keeping the incentives low in cost because ideally I would rather see a lot of people contribute a little bit in show of support.  In return you get art and a discount at my salon.  I wouldn't have been able to accomplish starting a business without the help of those who believe in me and I just want to pay it forward to someone dear to me.  JD did an awesome job raising funds for a St. Baldrick's event held at my salon without expecting anything in return.  I am trying to net $1000(which is about the amount he had raised) toward his branding to show him good deeds can get repaid and I honestly think he would get nervous accepting more.  </p><p>So, at this point Indiegogo requests that I detail more precisely where the funds will go. If we raise the full $1500 initially about $290 will go toward taxes and $135 toward the fees of running the campaign.  In accepting the challenge, $75 will go to Project Anti-Bully until their design is created.  Beyond that, it's somewhat theoretical, but a run of 24 Tshirts costs about $200.

From the moment we grabbed our first weapon, we led a path of discovery: exploring hundreds of places in the face of gods and dragons, sharing a journey with countless others. However, what made this story great was more than that – it was the stories forged from being in a community many call home. The cards of this deck attempt to encapsulate that story – of places traveled, moments remembered, characters never forgotten.</p><p>With this project, we promise to deliver the best project we can, at the highest quality we can afford.

Now, the world calls on you again. Alone or together, you cannot fall.Tyrian Tarot is a 78-card Marseilles-based deck created by the Guild Wars 2 Artist Collective, under the summer charity project called the GW2 Tarot Club. All of the contributors are fans just like you – people who have traveled through the game and experienced its story – and individuals who really wanted to create something to remember under the name of the game they love. Every one of them have put their all into the project, and we’re sure you’ll see it reflected in the cards.The first card, The Faceless Commander, puts you on the path through the Major Arcana, while each of the following cards depict important characters, events, locations and parts of the game that shape the experience of the Guild Wars 2 journey. The artists have all come together to paint what ties us all together, all while supporting the International Fund for Animal Welfare charity with the net proceeds of our project.Whether you’re a Guild Wars player that’s been with the game since its first launch thirteen years ago, or you just picked up its sequel recently, we all share a love for this game, and we hope you’re able to support these fantastic contributors and the project.With all current unlocked stretch and pledge goals, the current bundle for The Fool now comes with a physical hardcover book, two postcards, two extra vinyl stickers and a free pin, along with the deck being fully gilded in a 2-piece foiled box with 105 cards. Featuring illustrations from 68 artists from around the world, the Tyrian Tarot deck is comprised of 78 main cards (the 22 Major Arcana and the 56 Minor Arcana), along with  25 unlocked Wild Cards - achieved through the pledge & stretch goals.The cards measure at 2.75”x4.75” (standard tarot size), printed on 330 gsm black-core stock with a matte anti-scratch finish. They are gilded and in a custom foiled 2-piece box, designed by Weston T. Jones - another goal achieved through the stretch goals of the campaign. The card back designs (both variants) are designed by Qesque. The BookThe companion guide is a 264-page resource that comes with every deck purchase. It is physically printed as a 5.5""x8.5” book that is foiled, debossed hardcover. Converting from a PDF to the foiled, debossed hardcover was another stretch goal the campaign achieved.The book includes passages to explain the meanings of the cards and interpretations, as well as artist commentaries on their pieces.The cover is designed by the lovely Isvoc, with foiling and adjustments by the moderation team. The Shipping Conundrum - SolvedWe happily ship worldwide! Our rates are normalized to $9 shipping in the U.S., and $12 shipping for the rest of the world. In addition, we'll be paying for any EU Customs (if you're outside of the EU/US, normal customs will still apply).How did we do this? We'll be shipping ordered decks to a distributor in the EU that will ship full packages out, paying for the base shipping expense along with the initial customs fees - it reduces the costs by at least $15 per package. Please note that if you order a copy after our initial campaign/post-campaign store and initial shipment and need it shipped internationally, the price will be around $35 to ship both the box and the book.Please note that all card previews are subject to change. We have, however, attempted to portray as many of these pieces as accurately as we could.Add-OnsWe have partnered with Backerkit, a company that helps with backer support, and will be doing surveys (including add-ons) and the pre-order/post-order store through their services. You will be emailed a link to a survey to fill it out and, at that time, you'll be able to add any extra selections you'd like. TL;DR: You are not adding these now, and can adjust your number and quantities in the days after the campaign! :)The pricing list is below for your reference! The below are unlimited but we will not be able to reproduce them after the campaign (they are pledge exclusives). All selections made within the campaign were reset with the import.

Artists offering prints were allowed to decide if they'd donate their ""net"" or keep it. This is up to their discretion and not disclosed.
LARGER PRINTS will be available starting June 16. We are currently evaluating EU orders.Commission OpportunitiesCommissions are offered through the campaign for select artists who have opted in. These commissions come with the deck and any unlocks, as well as a printed copy of your illustration (and digital). We will put you in contact with your artist so that you can come to an agreement on ideas, and your commission will begin shortly after the conclusion of the campaign (so we can pay them). There are five tiers, listed below, with the artists who are available/reserved. NOTICE: All 23 commissions are reserved.Reserved Commissions (Reference)Tier 5: H1fey (Wojtek Depczyński); Tier 5: Casondra Logan; Tier 4: H1fey (Wojtek Depczyński); Tier 4: Casondra; Tier 3: Ohm; Tier 3: Ranya Ni; Tier 2: H1fey (Wojtek Depczyński); Tier 2:  Celebril; Tier 2: Shahina; Tier 2: Sketching Sands; Tier 2:  Thavie; Tier 1:  Celebril; Tier 1:  Sketching Sands; Tier 1:  Rusavia; Tier 1: Ohm; Tier 1 (x2): Shahina; Tier 1 (x3): Kyla Frank; Tier 1 (x2): Route 13; Tier 1: Diana Glebowicz
With the Indiegogo campaign, we’ve designed a variety of goals in three categories. We recognize that our community comes from all over, and there are a number of places you could come from, and we wanted to make this experience a fun one. Please note that once we unlock a goal, it gets added to physical decks or becomes an option without any adjustment from you. There's no need to adjust your pledge. Stretch goals are the traditional type of funding goal, directly coming from the monetary value involved with the campaign. These goals only happen after we are fully funded for the base production of the decks.Pledge goals are our spin on community goals. Every pledge, whether it’s $1 or $100, counts to these, and there are a lot of great unlocks here. Dominantly, the team have come together to create extra cards including gods, dragons and characters they really wanted to see in the deck.Social media goals started on April 20th. We have two stickers that will be posted to social media (one for each platform). If they hit the requirements listed, they’ll get unlocked for every Tyrian Tarot bundle.Our wonderful contributors of the GW2 Tarot Club project began work on the deck early this year, pouring their love for the game and creative power into the pieces for this collaboration. Both new and returning artists were specially selected, aiming to create a cohesive deck in appearance, with care and consideration for the world we are representing. See below to visit their professional profiles - for their various social media platforms, please check out our full contributor listing on Tumblr.Moderation:Mel Sayre (Zorav) ◊◊ Angelique van der Mee ◊◊ Aun Hana ◊◊ Sara Danger ◊◊ ThunderpotArtists (including participating moderation):Alassa ◊◊ allpurposepanda ◊◊ Andrés Agostini ◊◊ Anez ◊◊ Angelique van der Mee ◊◊ Anneliese Mak ◊◊ Aun Hana ◊◊ BleachedRainbows ◊◊ Casondra  ◊◊ Celebril ◊◊ Changer the Elder ◊◊ Chilkat ◊◊ chrisqi ◊◊ Cortez ◊◊ Diana Glebowicz (Larea) ◊◊ Elodie Mondoloni ◊◊ evermeer ◊◊ Evi ◊◊ Favena ◊◊ Fell ◊◊ Flutti ◊◊ gears2gnomes ◊◊ Grise ◊◊ Htg17 ◊◊ Isvoc ◊◊ Jem ◊◊ Josephine-frays ◊◊ Juuni ◊◊ Katalean ◊◊ kingbaest ◊◊ kinixuki ◊◊ KoboldArt ◊◊ Kyla Frank ◊◊ Landylachs ◊◊ Lemoncholy ◊◊ Mamath ◊◊ Marta Milczarek ◊◊ Mike Nash ◊◊ Ohm ◊◊ Owlma ◊◊ PlaviGmaz ◊◊ Ragous ◊◊ Ranya Ni ◊◊ Route13 ◊◊ Rurush_Ichi ◊◊ Rusavia ◊◊ Sara Danger ◊◊ Sarianne ◊◊ Sayael ◊◊ Shahina ◊◊ Shunkaku ◊◊ Skaven Zverov ◊◊ Sketching Sands ◊◊ Sleepsunn ◊◊ Smirtouille ◊◊ sockpoppet ◊◊ Tealful Eyes ◊◊ Thavie ◊◊ Thunderpot ◊◊ Tim Kaminski ◊◊ Travis Purvis ◊◊ Veer ◊◊ Weston T.

From the moment we grabbed our first weapon, we led a path of discovery: exploring hundreds of places in the face of gods and dragons, sharing a journey with countless others. However, what made this story great was more than that – it was the stories forged from being in a community many call home. The cards of this deck attempt to encapsulate that story – of places traveled, moments remembered, characters never forgotten.With this project, we promise to deliver the best project we can, at the highest quality we can afford. These aren’t meant to be “just community projects,” but something that you can pull off your shelves for years to come. We hope the breakdown below can provide any additional clarification on our operations, but elsewise, please let us know so we can address it.Fund AllocationNote: The image above is an estimation for sales given a 750 deck order, unlocking at least the 2-piece box and the perfect bound, foiled physical book, as well as the free world completion pin. The charity margin goes up if we increase our deck and print orders.Notice on 11/2018: A donation of $42,000 has been made to the International Fund for Animal Welfare. This was 33% of our overall budget donated to the cause.TimelineRisks & ChallengesThe risks and challenges of any project at this size usually falls to logistics and planning. While the moderation team of Tyrian Tarot are by no means immune to potential pitfalls, we have done the best we can to safeguard the project in as many ways as we can.With a previous project completed, this is the second Guild Wars 2 project led by the same leadership. Sponsored by ArenaNet, we’ll be working to fulfill all of our promised tiers in a prompt and efficient manner - the Wintersday Zine in December 2017 was shipped out only 17 days after orders closed, exactly on schedule, and we aim to keep that promise with this project in staying as close to our dictated timeline as possible. In the event of delays, we’ll always be prompt with updating anyone through the updates on this page and social media.By the time the campaign ends, all artwork will be completed, and all that remains will be the proofing and assembly of the book. Our ultimate goal is to do right by all of our fabulous artists while giving to a good cause. To foster that we’re working with a high-quality printer that will produce the best deck/book that they can, and have an experienced team to put it all together.With that, the funding of this project is in your hands, and we love you for considering to support us. If you have any questions at any time, we are always happy to answer them at gw2collective@gmail.com.",35.0,0,"5 Campaigns

For years in the educational system we have studied misleading history books that painted only a portion of our history, keeping us in the dark (pun intended) on a large percentage of our ancestry.

Scruggs and I am a photographer, photo editor, and writer living and working in Chicago. This campaign is to raise money for the tuition to attend an artist residency program at the Vermont Studio Center this summer.  The VSC artist in residence program provides a safe space for artists from around the world to live and make work in Johnson, VT.  Artists are provided with studios and facilities and are encouraged to come to the residency without a specific idea or project in mind to allow artistic growth, development, and exploration.  **Click each perk to see all included items**There is a tuition fee and I have been fortunate enough to have a third of it covered by the Vermont Studio Center. I have also already paid a deposit to hold my space because I am committed to continuing to grow as an artist and sustain my career in photography.

was 12.  After she graduated college she
bought a plane ticket and packed up what she could in a few boxes and moved out
to San Francisco in 2004.  Some of the
earliest friendships helped her survive the difficulties of moving to a new
city.  After years of working to survive
and working in corporate jobs, she came up with this idea for a company which
could help her pursue her passion for event planning and art.  Pink Elephant Art Nights is based off of her
arts &amp; craft nights which have been hosted in her home.  She hosted these events for several years and
invited friends to bring others.  After
meeting some amazing people through these events she decided why not bring
these events to others and enjoy great food in the process.  So she decided to quit her day job which was
making her miserable after the support of her amazing friends.  This is how it all began.  Now it’s up to you to be part of this and

<p><b>The project:</b></p>
<p><i>Thor and Greta </i>is conceived as a 35mm photography and music video exhibition. It is part of an ongoing project called <i>Portraits</i>.</p>
<p>One image is not enough to express the complexity of a being, so I wanted to create whole exhibitions that could be experienced as a journey into a character's psychological reality. </p>
<p>Weaving photography, video and music within a gallery space, enables a complete and multi faceted exploration of a person's inner struggle, from their most dense and foggy paralysis, to their most life affirming powerful state.</p>
<p>The photographs, which compose the first part of the exhibition, fix and isolate the various emotional patterns that suffocate and constrict the character.</p>
<p>The music video breaks this silence, this fixity: these states are not rigid manacles within which the character is stuck, but moving and living phases of life, that the character can master.</p>
<p>The whole project is an ongoing collaboration with musician Lottie Bowater<i>. </i>Not only was she the subject of the first portrait (Elise), but she is also the music composer who has been with me since the beginning, creating sounds that so accurately mirror and condense in audio form the emotional content I attempt to express visually. </p>
<p>The work process with the characters is very intense and intimate, none of them are actors, all express very real and personal emotions.</p>

<p>Record the music.</p>
<p>Film Greta's video part.</p>
<p>Photograph + Film Thor.</p><p><br/></p>
<p>1) The crew: </p>
<p>For the work to be as powerful as it can be, it is important that we isolate ourselves from our lives and fully plunge into the world of the work. </p>
<p>The people that work with me are all very dedicated to this project, taking time off their work, off their lives. Since I cannot yet pay any of them, it is primordial that I provide for all of their expenses (flight, food and shelter).

<p>For Greta, we are shooting the video in Paris for two weeks this spring. I will need to provide all expenses for her and our light technician. As well as pay for the rental of our shooting location. Amounting in total to about 1000 euros.</p>
<p>For Thor, we will be shooting the photography and the video in Norway for three weeks this summer. I will need to pay for flights, basic expenses for him, our light technician and myself, as well as gasoline for the boat (since we will mainly be shooting at sea).

<p>2) The music:</p>
<p>Lottie Bowater is the music composer for the whole <i>Portraits </i>project, and she is completely working for free, giving so much of herself, composing, recording, gathering musicians, paying for the studio sessions out of her own pocket. The song she created for this second portrait is a 10 minute piece, mainly instrumental, it is longer, more complex then the last song and is thus more demanding materially.</p>
<p>Lottie will play the violin, the piano and the accordion parts herself, but we will need to hire a sax player, a cellist, a drummer and a bass player.</p>
<p>60% of the music money will go to our musicians, and 40% will be for the recording / engineer fee.</p>
<p>In total, this will amount to 650 euros.</p><p><br/></p>
<p>3) The photography:</p>
<p>I work on 35mm film. In a project where the aim is to render the movement of the most subtle emotional states, being able to capture every lights, colours and shadows is essential, and I find that only 35mm film can provide that level of depth and detail!</p>
<p>I am finished with the Greta photography part, but I need help to be able to shoot Thor's part. I use approximately 30 cans of films, which, with the processing + scanning of the negatives amounts to 550 euros. </p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p>

<p>I know that you are bombarded with campaigns like this all the time so we wanted to make your 'reward' for helping out more than a symbolic one.</p>
<p>Me and Lottie figured that the only real, solid perks we could give out were photos (on my part) and music (on hers).</p>
<p>If you choose to put some of your money into this project, you will get a printed photograph of your choice, basically making it as if you were simply buying one of my photos, except the money would not go to my pocket / a gallery but towards funding the whole project. Each print will be traditionally done (i.e in a darkroom).</p>
<p></p><p>Or in a similar way, you can purchase some of Lottie's music, the songs she wrote under her stage name Depresstival, or new material she will compose for you, and again, the money acquired from the selling of her work will not go to her pocket / a record label but towards the making of more music!</p><p>----------</p>

</div></div>","The project:
Thor and Greta is conceived as a 35mm photography and music video exhibition. It is part of an ongoing project called Portraits.
One image is not enough to express the complexity of a being, so I wanted to create whole exhibitions that could be experienced as a journey into a character's psychological reality. 
Weaving photography, video and music within a gallery space, enables a complete and multi faceted exploration of a person's inner struggle, from their most dense and foggy paralysis, to their most life affirming powerful state.
The photographs, which compose the first part of the exhibition, fix and isolate the various emotional patterns that suffocate and constrict the character.
The music video breaks this silence, this fixity: these states are not rigid manacles within which the character is stuck, but moving and living phases of life, that the character can master.
The whole project is an ongoing collaboration with musician Lottie Bowater. Not only was she the subject of the first portrait (Elise), but she is also the music composer who has been with me since the beginning, creating sounds that so accurately mirror and condense in audio form the emotional content I attempt to express visually. 
The work process with the characters is very intense and intimate, none of them are actors, all express very real and personal emotions.

</li>
<li>Bipolar disorder is a topic that's widely misunderstood, which is why an awareness campaign is crucial. We need to change the way people discuss mental health, and encourage a culture that embraces people with mental illness, rather than disregarding them.</li>
<li>From 2010 through 2015 I directed social media for two nationally-recognized advocacy organizations in DC, so I have lots of experience in running and delivering on digital campaigns that make an impact. <span style=""background-color: initial;""> </span>

<p>While there is always a chance of a major bipolar episode, given my current lifestyle and consistent treatment, the likelihood of that is extremely small. I will also have the help of my dear husband Ian, if necessary.</p>
<p>Since I will be self-publishing, there should by minimal delays with the book going to print.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Even if you can't contribute financially, sharing my Indiegogo campaign through social media and email would mean so much to me! </p>

In order to raise awareness about bipolar disorder and fight the stigma that affects millions of Americans, I'm publishing an art book and launching and 28-day blog called ""The Bipolar Alphabet."" 

The art book, titledThe Bipolar Alphabet Picture Book, is based on the blog. It will include 26 hand-painted illustrations and a few pages of photos from my life and loved ones who have supported me. Each illustration will have accompanying text in the form of couplets. Think ""A is for anxiety that eats at your brain. It tells you to hide, 'You should be afraid.'"" (SPOILER: Not every page will be about eating brains. I'm not that much of a zombie fanatic!)



The blog itself is going up every weekday from Tuesday, May 3rd through Thursday, June 9th. There will be one post for each letter of the alphabet, with the exception of the first and last day. In the blog I am also sharing photos from my life and narrative commentary that gives readers an intimate look into the inner workings of a person with this mood disorder. I'm including a few mini-interviews from friends and family to get perspectives from people who've witnessed (and been affected by) my mental illness first-hand.


What We Need & What You Get 

As a backer, your money will go toward publishing the book, promotional costs, as well as necessary art supplies and living expenses during the time I'm managing the blog and associated social accounts as a full-time job.
 Expense breakout:


Publishing costs: $6,500
Reward fulfillment: $2,000
Art supply cost: $300
Living expenses while writing and running the blog: $1,200

The money will also go toward creating awesome rewards for backers to choose from: 

   Why Should You Invest In This Project?


As someone with bipolar disorder, I can truly speak to the cause with my personal story.

Bipolar disorder is a topic that's widely misunderstood, which is why an awareness campaign is crucial. We need to change the way people discuss mental health, and encourage a culture that embraces people with mental illness, rather than disregarding them.
From 2010 through 2015 I directed social media for two nationally-recognized advocacy organizations in DC, so I have lots of experience in running and delivering on digital campaigns that make an impact.  
    Risks & Challenges  
While there is always a chance of a major bipolar episode, given my current lifestyle and consistent treatment, the likelihood of that is extremely small. I will also have the help of my dear husband Ian, if necessary.
Since I will be self-publishing, there should by minimal delays with the book going to print.   Other Ways You Can Help Even if you can't contribute financially, sharing my Indiegogo campaign through social media and email would mean so much to me!",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div></div>","Short Summary I Started the Fire is a short character study about internal struggle and transition. A young woman is accused of setting a deadly fire in her home town. To avoid punishment for a fire she believes she did not set, she flees to the woods, building her camp around an abandoned car hidden in a clearing. With this new found isolation, freedom and need to survive,  the young woman uncovers her true relationship with fire, and struggles to control it.

<p>Hello! My name is Matt Bero, and I am an artist and advocate for public art; currently focusing my efforts in my hometown of Green Bay, WI, but with the hope of expanding my message to a wider audience. By day I am a digital designer, by night and weekends, I involve myself in the community and more specifically public art. Supporting it, helping to produce it, and creating awareness are all actions I take on a regular basis. Aside from Look Up Art, I am planning an art show, Catalyst, that will raise $10,000 for <a href=""http://www.downtowngreenbay.com/art-on-main"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Art on Main</a>, a public art program in Green Bay, WI. All of the funds raised by Catalyst will go towards the creation of more public art! </p>
<p> I am the creator of ""Morty the Moose."" Morty is a 63-foot wide mural located in the Arts District of Green Bay. With the help of Art on Main, Au Naturale, and The Production Farm, along with many others, Morty was born in October 2015.<br/></p>

<p>This $5,000 goal for Look Up Art will secure my seat with MTP, and help to underwrite the costs of the journey and its associated programming, transportation, and hospitality costs. <br/></p>
<p>By contributing to this project, you will help to remove the barriers that prevent artists and communities from creating art like Morty, and instead, empower them to help their communities grow and their residents to be inspired. With the experience on MTP, we'll better understand what goes into a piece of public art and how we can create more! </p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">When starting on the endeavor of creating a 63-foot mural, I wasn't entirely sure how I was going to pull it off.

<p>Our new creation was not planned (like a lot of our art pieces) so we were not ready for this one. We never thought we would have a 3rd child and that it would have to be a miracle for something like this to happen. Well a miracle happened! Betty Gourley (Roark’s mom) passed a way in February, 2013 and then Michelle got pregnant shortly thereafter...first thoughts in our heads was it’s Betty Boop!</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">The baby is a healthy boy per the ultrasound and DNA testing...his name is <b>Morgan Darby Gourley</b>, which means Free by the Sea. He is due March 1st, Chinese year of the horse and Pisces, so our little seahorse!</p>

<p>Surviving as artists in this economy has its up and downs.... We both are very productive but times have been tough. We have insurance but the deductible is a high deductible of <b>$8500.00</b>. Monies need to be in place by week 36. Michelle is 22 weeks as of 10/20/2013. Due date is March 1st, 2014.</p>
<p>In order to have a <b><i>healthy</i></b> baby and <b><i>safe</i></b> birth, we need your support and participation. Donations will go toward:</p>
<h4>-prenatal care<br/>-tests<br/>-the birth</h4>
<p>Most of you will be are direct friends and family who we sent the link to this site. We feel this is a very fun and simple way to contribute to Baby Morgan. Instead of a baby present, this is your gift. We HIGHLY encourage you to forward this to your friends and family and people that you know that love the creation of life. Anyone can participate and they can let us know who they are and get some of the fun perks or they can be anonymous.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Your help will be greatly appreciated! If the proceeds to this campaign exceeds the $8500, monies above and beyond will go toward baby well care visits, diapers, etc. as the list goes on...</p>

To some this may not sound like an art project but we can tell you as full-time professional artist this is the ultimate creation. 

Michelle does clothing and painting www.michellelance.com and Roark does sculpture and photography www.roarkgourley.com. 








We have already created two beautiful daughters, currently 16 and 9, and they are our greatest creations… of course they are still a work in process but they are both outstanding artists and students. 


 
 Elle - Artist (check out the shoes) Gamer, Video Editor, Cyber Kid

 
Anya - A+ Student, Actress, Musician, Dancer, Artist

Our new creation was not planned (like a lot of our art pieces) so we were not ready for this one. We never thought we would have a 3rd child and that it would have to be a miracle for something like this to happen. Well a miracle happened! Betty Gourley (Roark’s mom) passed a way in February, 2013 and then Michelle got pregnant shortly thereafter...first thoughts in our heads was it’s Betty Boop!
The baby is a healthy boy per the ultrasound and DNA testing...his name is Morgan Darby Gourley, which means Free by the Sea. He is due March 1st, Chinese year of the horse and Pisces, so our little seahorse!


Baby Morgan- first underwater picture

Surviving as artists in this economy has its up and downs.... We both are very productive but times have been tough. We have insurance but the deductible is a high deductible of $8500.00. Monies need to be in place by week 36. Michelle is 22 weeks as of 10/20/2013. Due date is March 1st, 2014.
In order to have a healthy baby and safe birth, we need your support and participation. Donations will go toward:
-prenatal care-tests-the birth
Most of you will be are direct friends and family who we sent the link to this site. We feel this is a very fun and simple way to contribute to Baby Morgan. Instead of a baby present, this is your gift. We HIGHLY encourage you to forward this to your friends and family and people that you know that love the creation of life. Anyone can participate and they can let us know who they are and get some of the fun perks or they can be anonymous.


Your help will be greatly appreciated! If the proceeds to this campaign exceeds the $8500, monies above and beyond will go toward baby well care visits, diapers, etc. as the list goes on...
Perks
We are going to do a special underwater shoot with Michelle pregnant so you have a choice of pictures of Morgan OR Michelle's photo shoot.

1. Pen Pal - $10 listed in Morgan's baby book as a supporter!

2. Playdate Buddy - $20  all the above plus email announcement of birth with online gallery pictures of Baby Morgan and underwater shoot.



3. Cousin- $50  Button with Morgan's smiling little face OR button of Michelle underwater photo shoot AND site access to pictures and video with weekly updates.


or


4. Kissing Cousin- $100  all the above plus Baby Morgan coffee mug OR mug of Michelle underwater photo shoot..

<b>Short Summary</b>
<p></p>
<p>Hi everyone!  We are Mel Dominguez (painter, visual artist, muralist) and Carla Turco (graphic designer), artistic affiliates with <i>Safos</i> Dance Theatre. Together, we are
embarking on “Color the Mural: A Community Mural Project.” <i>Safos</i> is an emerging dance company in Tucson, AZ that creates
modern dance unique to the U.S.-Mexico borderland experience. S<i>afos </i>is a multi-disciplinary company and
committed to creating contemporary artistic forms that reflect the common
experiences of our diverse community.</p>
<p>Color the Mural will highlight the 50+ year history of the House of Neighborly Service in South Tucson, including stories from local residents who grew up with HNS. We are utilizing a new mural
technique where we trace the mural out on pellon, cut it into squares like a
quilt and take it out into the community to paint. This enables us to reach
more people in the community, from elders to youth, and paint the squares
indoors without having to paint on the wall in the desert heat. We are very
passionate about this project because the mural arts can bring communities
together.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

<p>Your generous contribution will help
us purchase the supplies we need to paint the mural!!  We need everything from paint, pellon,

<p>Hello world, mi name is Jose Carlos Rebimbas Quintero and this is my story.       I was born in Caracas, Venezuela. My mom is from Colombia and my father from Portugal. Since I am a kid music and these multiple cultures have been part of my life. I grew up in love with music and art, breathing and feeling these since always. At age seven i had my first musical instrument, the “cuatro” a beautiful instrument from my homeland Venezuela. with it, I did my first compositions and since then I knew that the music and I would have a long journey together. at age ten I moved to Colombia, my second home, and at fourteen I transitioned to the guitar. A whole new world of possibilities arrived with it, I had my first bands and projects that didn’t leave the rehearsal room but that allowed me to experiment with sounds and to interact with other music that like me were empirics.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1465698543/sensi6_zjad3k.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Years passed and brought Cielo Drive of Cielito which how i like to call it.cielito is the project in which i have created more music, I was able to I have my first concerts, record songs, records, we were played in the radio, made video clips. I saw the faces of many peoples feeling happy when we played for them.With Cielito I started my career in the world of music, this world that many call “the world of entertainment”or “the music business”and it was then when my headaches also started.</span></p>

<p>i begun to understand and learn how everything  happens within this world, how the business works. These ways has perturbed me since then. It makes me upset to see how power relations and money you might have to promote your project is more important than the talent itself. For me everything was about the creative and humanistic process of making music. I never saw it as a business so it was hard to face how vicious and manipulative the business can be. By not playing thses games many doors were closed, but being independent also opened many others. </p>

<p>in the last 4 years, day by day I breath and emanate music. I have been developing a lot of new ideas, songs, and right now I have about 300 songs ready to be produced. These is why, today, finally, I have decided to launch my first crowfunding campaign. I will call it “MULTI DREAM”</p>

<p>I had thought about it many times before, but I didn’t, perhaps because I was afraid not to reach the goal, or that my ideas weren’t attractive enough for my community of donors. This is the right moment, so I will tell you what this multi dream campaign is about. I already told you about Cielito Drive. my first and most loved project, not only for all it has represented in my life, also because of all I have learned quite a lot and I have produced the most music with them. But my passion and love for music have brought me to eight projects!!! I am devoted and inlove with each of them.</p>

<p>Jose Reb is my second project, my solo project. It was born from the need of singing and recording the songs that didn’t make it in Cielito! je! and for my surprise it has been well received. more than I expected. With this project I have recorded songs with two great producers and friends ..... . As today we have ten songs in process of recording and mixing. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1465657813/282210_490972237594504_1732740079_n_rvh2wn.jpg"" src="""" style=""background-color: initial;""/></p>

<p>Los monoplonicos is my third project, and is a band i have with one of my lieftime friends Ricardo..... I started as a pianist and now I am the drummer. This is a power trio influenced by Latin-American and European rock. And it’s been a wonderful because of the freedom and magic we experience when we create and play music. We are finishing up our first EP with 5 songs.</p>

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Hello world, mi name is Jose Carlos Rebimbas Quintero and this is my story.       I was born in Caracas, Venezuela. My mom is from Colombia and my father from Portugal. Since I am a kid music and these multiple cultures have been part of my life. I grew up in love with music and art, breathing and feeling these since always. At age seven i had my first musical instrument, the “cuatro” a beautiful instrument from my homeland Venezuela. with it, I did my first compositions and since then I knew that the music and I would have a long journey together. at age ten I moved to Colombia, my second home, and at fourteen I transitioned to the guitar. A whole new world of possibilities arrived with it, I had my first bands and projects that didn’t leave the rehearsal room but that allowed me to experiment with sounds and to interact with other music that like me were empirics.


Years passed and brought Cielo Drive of Cielito which how i like to call it.cielito is the project in which i have created more music, I was able to I have my first concerts, record songs, records, we were played in the radio, made video clips. I saw the faces of many peoples feeling happy when we played for them.With Cielito I started my career in the world of music, this world that many call “the world of entertainment”or “the music business”and it was then when my headaches also started.





i begun to understand and learn how everything  happens within this world, how the business works. These ways has perturbed me since then. It makes me upset to see how power relations and money you might have to promote your project is more important than the talent itself. For me everything was about the creative and humanistic process of making music. I never saw it as a business so it was hard to face how vicious and manipulative the business can be. By not playing thses games many doors were closed, but being independent also opened many others. 


It’s been a long and hard road that I will continue to  walk…


in the last 4 years, day by day I breath and emanate music. I have been developing a lot of new ideas, songs, and right now I have about 300 songs ready to be produced. These is why, today, finally, I have decided to launch my first crowfunding campaign. I will call it “MULTI DREAM”


I had thought about it many times before, but I didn’t, perhaps because I was afraid not to reach the goal, or that my ideas weren’t attractive enough for my community of donors. This is the right moment, so I will tell you what this multi dream campaign is about. I already told you about Cielito Drive. my first and most loved project, not only for all it has represented in my life, also because of all I have learned quite a lot and I have produced the most music with them. But my passion and love for music have brought me to eight projects!!! I am devoted and inlove with each of them.


Jose Reb is my second project, my solo project. It was born from the need of singing and recording the songs that didn’t make it in Cielito! je! and for my surprise it has been well received. more than I expected. With this project I have recorded songs with two great producers and friends ..... . As today we have ten songs in process of recording and mixing.

This is a power trio influenced by Latin-American and European rock. And it’s been a wonderful because of the freedom and magic we experience when we create and play music. We are finishing up our first EP with 5 songs.
Son brothers is my fourth project, is duo of alternative music I have with another great friend and music partner Oscar...This project was born because every time we got together it was inevitable to make music, so we create everything it occurs to us, without limitations or pretensions.

LT is my sixth project, is a due i have with a german friend I met in Barranquilla, and we need up making music together. he is like a twin soul that you don’t expect to find but that unexpectedly appear from nowhere. We have an album with 10 super energetic and fun songs already recorded, the album is in process of mixing. 


Marte y remolino is my seventh project and not for being seventh is the less important but is the one is paper and preproduction. it is a dream duo I have with my son, yes, I have a seven year old son with whom I have been creating.    I am teaching him to love music and art. He is super talented. it is beautiful thing i that he is a musician like me and his mother whom is also a musician. We support him to develop all of his talents.


This project is a result of thousands of ideas that we have when we are together. We start with the guitar, I give him melodies so he can improvise and from there everything becomes magic. The ideas is to record 10 of our best compositions and invite other children to participate. To conclude I want to share other collaboration I have been working on with other musicians and friends.

<p></p>
<h3>Background<br/>
</h3>
<p>A few years ago I discovered the beauty of train travel. I became so entranced by the unique and humanizing qualities of the train -- perhaps America's most underappreciated public space -- that I made it the topic of my master's thesis at the MIT Department of Urban Studies &amp; Planning last year. You can read more about that project here: <a href=""https://nextcity.org/daily/entry/what-long-distance-trains-teach-us-about-public-space-in-america"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://nextcity.org/daily/entry/what-long-distance-trains-teach-us-about-public-space-in-america</a> and here: <a href=""http://danyasherman.tumblr.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://danyasherman.tumblr.com/</a><br/></p>
<p>Riding slowly through the beautiful and diverse geographies of America, with time to reflect and meet people from the landscapes you travel through, is an incredible experience and one that not enough people have. Long distance U.S. trains are designed to facilitate unique personal and social experiences while they move people from place to place. But financially, our passenger rail system was set up to fail, leaving transit riders (especially those away from the coasts and in rural areas) with few options for inter-city travel. <br/></p>
<p>Given how underutilized and yet how special our national rail system is, I'd like to partner with artists and cultural organizers around the country to spark new work and promote public transit.<br/></p>
<h3>My Background<br/>
</h3> <p>I am an urban planner, cultural programmer, organizer, and writer with over ten years of experience in urban development and community engagement. I founded and built the Department of Public Programs, Education, and Community Engagement for the High Line in New York, NY to ensure that the park was an an asset and platform for all New Yorkers, and then left to complete a master's degree at the MIT Department of Urban Studies &amp; Planning. I am currently based at MIT, developing multimedia case studies about urban development that has a positive social impact. I've worked on projects with ArtPlace America, the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission, Project Row Houses -- all with a focus on building and supporting democratic cultural activity.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Journey<br/>
</h3> <p>With your support, I will be joining 25 other young civic entrepreneurs on a one-week journey from Los Angeles to Detroit by train this August.

<p><strong>THE PROJECT</strong></p>
<p>As an animal lover I am proud to call Perth in Western Australia my home. I feel so fortunate to be able to drive only a short distance to be amongst native flora and fauna some would only see in books or film.</p>
<p>Almost 550 species of birds have been recorded in Western Australia. 387 species have been recorded breeding. 17 species are endemic to Western Australia. These are Carnaby's Black-Cockatoo, Baudin's Black-Cockatoo, Western Corella, Western Rosella, Red-capped Parrot, Noisy Scrub-bird, Red-winged Fairy-wren, Black Grasswren, Western Bristlebird, Dusky Gerygone, Western Thornbill, Western Wattlebird, Kimberley Honeyeater, Western Spinebill, White-breasted Robin, Western Ground Parrot and Red-eared Firetail. - Information supplied by Birdlife Australia.</p>
<p>A short time ago I was made aware of the current situation of the Western Ground Parrot. There are fewer than 150 of these birds left on our planet. These birds may no longer be around in the not so distant future. I began thinking about how I could possibly use my skills as an artist to help people become aware of the birds that are special to certain areas of Western Australia. If I could paint a mural of a bird on a wall close to where it is located than maybe people will start to take notice. If they were aware of it, maybe they would want to learn more about the species. If they learn more about the species maybe then they would realise how lucky we are to have a bird found nowhere else in Australia but our state.</p>
<p>I would like to think that in 100 years time we will still have all 17 of our endemic birds alive and well in their natural habitat....but we just don't know.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>THE PROCESS</strong></p>
<p>I will be collaborating with Western Australian photographers to create the murals I will be painting. The photographer will take a photo of the bird in the area it is known to frequent. I will then use the photograph as reference and, in my style, create a mural on the closest possible wall surface. Below the mural will be the name of the bird, the location, the photographer and my website. I am hoping that, with this project, I can share the special experience of collaborating with photographers and possibly create future possibilities for them by sharing their name. Each mural will be covered from start to finish on my website blog.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>THE FIRST MURAL</strong></p>
<p>To give you all a better idea of the project here is the first mural of the project which I completed at the start of July. The bird chosen was the Western Spinebill which was photographed by Gary Meredith in the Dryandra Woodlands near Narrogin.</p>

<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/275716/files/20131223083117-ImaginARTE_2013__4_.jpg?1387816277"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b>The Challenge:</b></p>
<p>As a
fledgling democracy emerging from a long era of dictatorship, Paraguay’s
sociopolitical climate often limits arts education, thereby resulting in
inhibited individual expression and low self-esteem. In early 2007, CoCuMu
(Compartiendo Cultura Mundial or Sharing World Culture) was formed, originally as a Peace Corps volunteer
committee seeking to promote arts and culture within Paraguay and
cross-cultural exchange between Paraguay and other countries. As a result, throughout the years, CoCuMu has been slowly evolving, along with community counterparts such as the Secretaría Nacional de Cultura and SENATUR (the cultural and tourism agencies of Paraguay), such as Ahecha Paraguay (“I see Paraguay”in Guaraní, Paraguay's official language along with Spanish) a participatory photography
project, Ahendu Paraguay (""I listen Paraguay""), a music-exchange concert and Ascrivi Paraguay (“I write Paraguay”) a creative writing project that also promotes literacy.</p><p>However, connecting youth with ways of artistic expression is still a work in progress. The Camp ImaginARTE was created with the intention of broadening the horizon of Paraguayan youth about visual and performing arts as a way of life, of embracing their cultural identity and furthermore, of providing them skills of self assurance and empowerment, that later they will use in all aspects of their lives.</p><p><i><b>El Reto:</b></i></p><p><i>Con una democracia que recién emerge de una era dictatorial, el marco sociocpolítico del Paraguay aún enfrenta retos en la formación creativa y artística de las generaciones jóvenes, que de alguna manera se ve reflejado en la inhibición de expresión y baja autestima de éstos. A principios del 2007, el comité CoCuMu (Compartiendo Cultura Mundial) se formó como resultado de una iniciativa de voluntarios de Cuerpo de Paz para promover las artes y la cultura dentro del Paraguay y entre otros países. Como resultado, CoCuMu ha ido evolucionando, de la mano con contrapartes paraguayos como la Secretaría Nacional de Cultura y la SENATUR  (agencias de gubernamentales de cultura y turismo respectivamente) como Ahecha Paraguay (""Yo veo a Paraguay"" en Guaraní, idioma oficial del Paraguay"") un proyecto participativo de fotografía, Ahendu Paraguay (""Yo escucho a Paraguay), un proyecto de intercambio musical y cultural. y Ascrivi Paraguay (""Yo escribo a Paraguay"") que consiste en talleres de escritura creativa. </i></p><p><i>No obstante, la posibilidad de conectar a la juventud con maneras de expresión artística está aún paulatinamente progresando. El Campamento ImaginARTE fue creado con la intención de expandir los horizontes de jóvenes paraguayos sobre las artes visuales y performáticas, exponerles a actividades en donde exploren su capacidad como entes culturales y artísticos mientras conocen su propia cultura, y además, proveerles con herramientas de empoderamiento y seguridad en sí mismos, que luego utilizarán en su día a día. </i></p><p><i></i></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/275722/files/20131223083202-ImaginARTE_2013__2_.jpg?1387816322"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b>The Opportunity:</b></p>
<p>The Paraguayan
youth make up more than half of the current population, thus, it is crucial to address this age group and provide them with a set of skills they will eventually use to steer the country's own future, and what a better way to do this than artistic expression? By providing the atmosphere
for inspiration and creativity, we can also encourage the youth to use the arts
as a tool to discover themselves. ImaginARTE will be the stage, the youth will be the artists. <br/></p><p><i><b>La Oportunidad:</b></i></p><p><i>La juventud paraguaya representa la mitad de la población del país. Por ende, es crucial atender a este grupo y proveerle herramientas que eventualmente usarán para dirigir el futuro del país, ¿y qué mejor manera de hacerlo que a través de la expresión artística? Al proveer la atmósfera que incentive la inspiración y creatividad, podemos también motivar a los jóvenes a utilizar las artes como una herramienta para descubrirse a sí mismos. ImaginARTE será el escenario, los jóvenes serán los artistas. </i></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/270181/files/20131219134432-ImaginARTE_2013__5_.jpg?1387489472"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>
<p><b>The Plan:</b> <br/><br/>After a very successful first edition of ImaginARTE on January 2013, SENATUR (Secretaria Nacional de Turismo) the agency responsible for tourism in
Paraguay and Peace Corps Paraguay will host the second ImaginARTE National
Youth Camp in February 2014. ImaginARTE is a three day, two night camp designed
to foster creativity in Paraguayan youth. In furthering the idea of living an
artful life--albeit professionally or in one’s free time--organizers will
connect participants with the tools and ideas to incorporate creative
activities into their daily lives, subsequently boosting their self-esteem and
increasing their capacity for critical thinking and creative problem solving.
Additionally, through workshop visits and activities led by local artists,
ImaginARTE aspires to increase the youth’s exposure to other forms of art, role
models, allies, and peers, thus encouraging collaboration.</p><p><i><b>El Plan:</b></i></p><p><i>Luego de una exitosa primera edición de ImaginARTE en enero 2013, SENATUR (Secretaría Nacional de Turismo) y Cuerpo de Paz Paraguay estarán llevando a cabo el segundo campamento nacional de ImaginARTE en febrero 2014. Durante tres días, el campamento está diseñado a incentivar la creativdad de los jóvenes paraguayos, conectándoles con herramientas e ideas para incorporar actividades creativas en su día a día, lo cual además proveerá la posibilidad de aumentar su autoestima y capacidad de pensamiento crítico y creativo. Adicional a ello, los jóvenes serán partícipes de charlas y talleres activos con artistas nacionales de distintas modalidades, como pintura, forografía, baile y teatro, con la intención de exponerles a modelos a seguir, e incentivando además la creación de colaboaciones y redes artísticas en el país. </i></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/270259/files/20131219144407-Imaginarte_Logo.jpg?1387493047"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/275726/files/20131223083346-oz-muralaregua.jpg?1387816426"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b><span>Successes</span></b><b>:</b></p>
<p>The first edition of ImaginARTE camp was a whole success within itself! Around 50 Paraguayan youth from most departments of Paraguay were able to attend and profit from the incredible activities the camp offered, including art workshops made from recycled materials, conferences on visual and performing arts, creative collaborations including a Footloose-inspired dance video with slippers the youth painted themselves and a mural with the collaboration of a talented national muralist, Oz Montania, and walks around local galleries; all of this in the beautiful art capital of Paraguay, Areguá. Furthermore, t<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">hese successes now travel with and are part of every single youth that was exposed to all these great experiences, and that is the greatest success of them all.</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The first ImaginARTE Camp has allowed the great coordination flow of the
second one. CoCuMu team members are currently working with community contacts to setup
programming and logistical needs for the camp. The
programming team, partnered with local artists and art agencies, are developing an
agenda for the camp and enlisting speakers and activity leaders for designated
events. The logistical team is working with gallery and workshop owners in Areguá to secure workshop visits and also

</div></div>","ImaginARTE: A Nationwide Paraguayan Art Camp
The Challenge:
As a
fledgling democracy emerging from a long era of dictatorship, Paraguay’s
sociopolitical climate often limits arts education, thereby resulting in
inhibited individual expression and low self-esteem. In early 2007, CoCuMu
(Compartiendo Cultura Mundial or Sharing World Culture) was formed, originally as a Peace Corps volunteer
committee seeking to promote arts and culture within Paraguay and
cross-cultural exchange between Paraguay and other countries. As a result, throughout the years, CoCuMu has been slowly evolving, along with community counterparts such as the Secretaría Nacional de Cultura and SENATUR (the cultural and tourism agencies of Paraguay), such as Ahecha Paraguay (“I see Paraguay”in Guaraní, Paraguay's official language along with Spanish) a participatory photography
project, Ahendu Paraguay (""I listen Paraguay""), a music-exchange concert and Ascrivi Paraguay (“I write Paraguay”) a creative writing project that also promotes literacy.However, connecting youth with ways of artistic expression is still a work in progress. The Camp ImaginARTE was created with the intention of broadening the horizon of Paraguayan youth about visual and performing arts as a way of life, of embracing their cultural identity and furthermore, of providing them skills of self assurance and empowerment, that later they will use in all aspects of their lives.El Reto:Con una democracia que recién emerge de una era dictatorial, el marco sociocpolítico del Paraguay aún enfrenta retos en la formación creativa y artística de las generaciones jóvenes, que de alguna manera se ve reflejado en la inhibición de expresión y baja autestima de éstos. A principios del 2007, el comité CoCuMu (Compartiendo Cultura Mundial) se formó como resultado de una iniciativa de voluntarios de Cuerpo de Paz para promover las artes y la cultura dentro del Paraguay y entre otros países. Como resultado, CoCuMu ha ido evolucionando, de la mano con contrapartes paraguayos como la Secretaría Nacional de Cultura y la SENATUR  (agencias de gubernamentales de cultura y turismo respectivamente) como Ahecha Paraguay (""Yo veo a Paraguay"" en Guaraní, idioma oficial del Paraguay"") un proyecto participativo de fotografía, Ahendu Paraguay (""Yo escucho a Paraguay), un proyecto de intercambio musical y cultural. y Ascrivi Paraguay (""Yo escribo a Paraguay"") que consiste en talleres de escritura creativa. No obstante, la posibilidad de conectar a la juventud con maneras de expresión artística está aún paulatinamente progresando. El Campamento ImaginARTE fue creado con la intención de expandir los horizontes de jóvenes paraguayos sobre las artes visuales y performáticas, exponerles a actividades en donde exploren su capacidad como entes culturales y artísticos mientras conocen su propia cultura, y además, proveerles con herramientas de empoderamiento y seguridad en sí mismos, que luego utilizarán en su día a día. The Opportunity:
The Paraguayan
youth make up more than half of the current population, thus, it is crucial to address this age group and provide them with a set of skills they will eventually use to steer the country's own future, and what a better way to do this than artistic expression? By providing the atmosphere
for inspiration and creativity, we can also encourage the youth to use the arts
as a tool to discover themselves. ImaginARTE will be the stage, the youth will be the artists. La Oportunidad:La juventud paraguaya representa la mitad de la población del país. Por ende, es crucial atender a este grupo y proveerle herramientas que eventualmente usarán para dirigir el futuro del país, ¿y qué mejor manera de hacerlo que a través de la expresión artística? Al proveer la atmósfera que incentive la inspiración y creatividad, podemos también motivar a los jóvenes a utilizar las artes como una herramienta para descubrirse a sí mismos. ImaginARTE será el escenario, los jóvenes serán los artistas. 
The Plan: After a very successful first edition of ImaginARTE on January 2013, SENATUR (Secretaria Nacional de Turismo) the agency responsible for tourism in
Paraguay and Peace Corps Paraguay will host the second ImaginARTE National
Youth Camp in February 2014. ImaginARTE is a three day, two night camp designed
to foster creativity in Paraguayan youth. In furthering the idea of living an
artful life--albeit professionally or in one’s free time--organizers will
connect participants with the tools and ideas to incorporate creative
activities into their daily lives, subsequently boosting their self-esteem and
increasing their capacity for critical thinking and creative problem solving.
Additionally, through workshop visits and activities led by local artists,
ImaginARTE aspires to increase the youth’s exposure to other forms of art, role
models, allies, and peers, thus encouraging collaboration.El Plan:Luego de una exitosa primera edición de ImaginARTE en enero 2013, SENATUR (Secretaría Nacional de Turismo) y Cuerpo de Paz Paraguay estarán llevando a cabo el segundo campamento nacional de ImaginARTE en febrero 2014. Durante tres días, el campamento está diseñado a incentivar la creativdad de los jóvenes paraguayos, conectándoles con herramientas e ideas para incorporar actividades creativas en su día a día, lo cual además proveerá la posibilidad de aumentar su autoestima y capacidad de pensamiento crítico y creativo. Adicional a ello, los jóvenes serán partícipes de charlas y talleres activos con artistas nacionales de distintas modalidades, como pintura, forografía, baile y teatro, con la intención de exponerles a modelos a seguir, e incentivando además la creación de colaboaciones y redes artísticas en el país. Successes:
The first edition of ImaginARTE camp was a whole success within itself! Around 50 Paraguayan youth from most departments of Paraguay were able to attend and profit from the incredible activities the camp offered, including art workshops made from recycled materials, conferences on visual and performing arts, creative collaborations including a Footloose-inspired dance video with slippers the youth painted themselves and a mural with the collaboration of a talented national muralist, Oz Montania, and walks around local galleries; all of this in the beautiful art capital of Paraguay, Areguá. Furthermore, these successes now travel with and are part of every single youth that was exposed to all these great experiences, and that is the greatest success of them all.The first ImaginARTE Camp has allowed the great coordination flow of the
second one. CoCuMu team members are currently working with community contacts to setup
programming and logistical needs for the camp. The
programming team, partnered with local artists and art agencies, are developing an
agenda for the camp and enlisting speakers and activity leaders for designated
events. The logistical team is working with gallery and workshop owners in Areguá to secure workshop visits and also
arranging lodging and transportation for participants. All of this, just to make this fantastic opportunity possible for a new group of Paraguayan youth, the future artists and leaders of this great country. Éxitos:¡La primera edición de ImaginARTE fue un éxito en sí mismo!

</div></div>","Our Story

 

A teenager gives up drugs
when he finds music.  A young boy finds
peace through drawing as he battles with cancer.  A child confronts the gang-related death of
his older brother through mixed media art. 
A teenage girl faces her fear of the dark through photography.  These are the stories of individuals who have
inspired me, while facilitating arts workshops in Guatemala City over the past three years.  In the midst of violence, drugs, gangs, and extreme
poverty heightened by flooding, earthquakes, and landslides, art has motivated these
youth and their families to rise up from the challenges of their daily lives
with hope and perseverance.  Combined
with self-reflection, art can give those in dire situations the confidence and determination
to take important steps in their lives.

 

Their stories should be
heard and they deserve the space to tell them.

 

Visions and Voices is a
six month journey to compile self-portraits and monologues from women whose
stories have not been told in Chile, Guatemala
and the U. S. South.  They are women who
are invisible to most of us: they may scavenge in the city dump; or sell their
bodies; or spend their hours behind bars. Yet, their voices are powerful and we
can learn from the wisdom of their lives.

 

Through Visions and Voices,
I will partner with other artists, educators and organizations to facilitate
workshops in which participants  use the
arts and creative process to find their individual and group voices.  They will write poems, monologues and develop
self-portraits that reflect upon their lives and futures.    

 

The first workshop will be
in Talca, Chile with partner organization Telling
My Story (www.tellingmystory.org)
in February and March, 2012.  The
workshop facilitators will be Artists/Educators Pati Hernandez, and Nell Pierce.  The second workshop will be in Guatemala City with mothers from the   Guatemala City garbage dump community,
partnering with Safe Passage (www.safepassage.org),
in March, 2012.  The third workshop will
be with transgender sex workers in Guatemala City, Guatemala, partnering with
an organization that works to protect sex workers from abuse, HIV/AIDS and to
protect LGBT rights in Guatemala.

Workshop four will work with Latino immigrants in Alabama,
and workshop five will work with homeless mothers in North Carolina.

 

The final product will be
an anthology in magazine or book form with a chapter focusing on each
workshop.  Each chapter will include the
stories of the women participants, and an informational section about ways you
can support the participants or become involved in the partnering
organization.  The anthology of stories
will connect participants who have faced similar experiences of exclusion
despite living in a different geographical location.  Each participant will keep their original
artwork and receive a final copy of the book/magazine.  
 
 


The Impact


 


""I learned things about myself,
where I am and where I am going.  I
learned to appreciate the little things we have and how to enjoy these little
things in life.""


 
""I can show happiness, sadness,
doubts, fears and the world in which we live.""


 
""With [my artwork] I can express
my emotions, I can share with other people what happens in the world and show
the world from a different point of view.""


 
- Student reflections on arts
workshops in Guatemala


 


Based upon my experiences
in Guatemala,
I expect the workshops to provide participants with tools for healing and
empowerment.  They will express their
unique perspectives on the world, confront challenging past experiences, and
envision a future full of creativity and possibility.  Many of my past students have been surprised
and shocked at the talent they possess and their ability to create something that
brings them pride.  They discovered a
passion within themselves that allows them to find peace in the midst of chaos.



 Approximately 15 women
from each of the 5 communities will participate in workshops, reaching up
to 75 participants.   Those of us who
become witnesses to the art and stories of these women will be given the
opportunity and the responsibility to ensure that their voices continue to be
heard.  While they often do not have the
mobility to travel outside of their communities, their artwork and writing can
transcend social, economic and geographic barriers to create dialogue and reach
new audiences.  With their stories, we
can raise awareness of the discrimination and exclusion they face, as well as
the inspiration they embody, and work together toward creating a global
community united by compassion and equality.



 





What We Need & What You Get

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Soulcraft Gallery is a gallery of furniture by Cleveland-based designers and makers which we aim (with your help!) to open in the newly renamed 5th Street (was Colonial) Arcade in downtown Cleveland.  It is an outgrowth of Soulcraft Woodshop; the burgeoning Cleveland design scene and a promising revitalization of Cleveland's downtown.</p>
<p>In July of 2012, we opened Soulcraft Woodshop, a community shop wherein the public can use our space for the own projects or take classes.  Furthermore, the Woodshop is home to a number of furniture designers and makers who are growing their businesses out of the shop. </p>
<p>We wanted to create a gallery to showcase the best of the work coming out of the shop, but also to display the tremendous work that has been generated in the growing furniture design scene in Cleveland.</p>
<p>When we open, will have 12 furniture designers from all over the Cleveland metropolitan area, many of whose work has been displayed nationally and occasionally internationally.  We want to give them a local gallery home. At present, the designers who will show include A Piece of Cleveland, Bomb Factory Furniture, 44 Steel, Forrest City Fabricators, Rust Belt Welding, Sawhorse Woodworks, Northend Woodworks, 2nd Shift Studio, Steve Yusko, Domenic Fiorello Studio, Shelley Mendenhall, and Peter Debelak.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are running this exciting campaign in parallel with our participation in a grant competition held by the Downtown Cleveland Alliance and the Charter One Foundation.  We are pleased to have been chosen as one of five finalists in that competition, and now we are asking the public to help make this vision a reality. </p>
<p>We will use the funds raised, in short, in order to get our doors open and to get the word out about each and every designer we showcase.  Our goal is to have a successful gallery, but moreso to enable each designer access to a broader audience:  the audience this Cleveland talent deserves.</p>
<p>We will use funds toward built out of the beautiful space at the 5th Street Arcade; initial marketing and events; website creation with an e-store; and to enable as many designers as possible to bring their products to a broader market.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The concept behind ""Soulcraft"" - both the Woodshop and the Gallery - is really just to <em>enable</em>. We feel we benefit from, but also will contribute to the success of a number of larger growth efforts:  1) The revitalization of downtown generally, and of the 5th Street Arcade specifically;  and 2) The growing furniture design scene in Cleveland.</p>
<p>There has been a robust discussion about Cleveland being a good ""fit"" for furniture design and production.  There is still tremendous interest in creating a Design District in Cleveland; and the furniture designers in Cleveland are beginning to get wide-spread recognition.  This has been boosted by such things as the annual F*Sho, a one-night contemporary furniture fair, as well as the remarkable reception Clevleand designers have received at international furniture fairs, such as ICFF in New York.</p>
<p>By launching a successful furniture and design gallery - indeed, a successful retail business - in downtown Cleveland, we are excited to benefit from and to contribute to the success of furniture design in Cleveland and the revitalization of Cleveland's downtown.</p>

</div><p>This is my world, one that I love and that inspires me daily. This is the Vermont Village where I grew up, worked, and played for over 5 decades and still inspires what I create. It seemed like a perfect subject for this project as it shows many aspects of our town. Residential, business and town government are represented by the buildings that have stood for well over 100 years. It includes a veteran's monument on a traditional New England town green with commemorative brick paving with a brick for my father who served in the Air Force for 20 years. I remember the house on the corner of the park, once owned by Dr. Bosworth displaying flags for each country. In the painting I thought it would be appropriate to show the connections of this fine community to the world, so I chose flags from 3 countries where I know people from the area have, and are still volunteering. I decided to paint the image in that fresh, early spring, morning light that signifies hope and a new beginning after a long gray winter. Like the hope that the United Way of Addison County brings to the community through programs involving education, health and financial stability. Small communities can, and do have impact on the larger canvas of our world and I am proud to be a part of this ground breaking project.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/994109/files/20141107071208-DOC_Thank_you_Photo_2013.jpg?1415373128"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p>

This is my world, one that I love and that inspires me daily. This is the Vermont Village where I grew up, worked, and played for over 5 decades and still inspires what I create. It seemed like a perfect subject for this project as it shows many aspects of our town. Residential, business and town government are represented by the buildings that have stood for well over 100 years. It includes a veteran's monument on a traditional New England town green with commemorative brick paving with a brick for my father who served in the Air Force for 20 years. I remember the house on the corner of the park, once owned by Dr. Bosworth displaying flags for each country. In the painting I thought it would be appropriate to show the connections of this fine community to the world, so I chose flags from 3 countries where I know people from the area have, and are still volunteering. I decided to paint the image in that fresh, early spring, morning light that signifies hope and a new beginning after a long gray winter. Like the hope that the United Way of Addison County brings to the community through programs involving education, health and financial stability. Small communities can, and do have impact on the larger canvas of our world and I am proud to be a part of this ground breaking project.

The Bottom LineWe are excited about this model and hope you are too. We need your support NOW to show both the art and non-profit worlds that this is the way of the future and at the same time provide critical services to our friends and neighbors in need. And, you will receive some great items as a thank you!Other Ways you can help

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>If we successfully reach our goal, I'll use the money to MAKE MORE NERDY GOODNESS! I'll stock my shop, and will take the Viral Good Word to the masses by offering these and other fun microbial accessories at art shows and science conferences. Beautiful pieces like these are where some of the best science outreach starts! I'll also be able to keep working with The Maker Bean to create more fun and unique new designs for you :D</p>
<p><strong>The Perks: </strong>(postage is included for rewards shipped to the US and Canada)</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">$1 - I'll email you an exclusive photo of one of my cats, taken just for you. They're really cute cats, so this will be totally worth it, especially if you're a graduate student who needs cute animal photos to get you through long days in the lab.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">$5 - you'll get an awesome sticker pack featuring all 5 new designs in fun colors. I'll pay the postage even if you're overseas, because I love you.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">$25 - you'll get one keychain or necklace of your choice.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">$40 (early bird) - you'll get two keychains or necklaces of your choice.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">$55 (early bird) - you'll get three keychains or necklaces of your choice.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">$90 (early bird) - you'll get FIVE (!!!) keychains or necklaces of your choice.</p>
<p>If (when!) the early bird perks run out, the following perks will become available:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">$45 - you'll get two keychains or necklaces of your choice.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">$65 - you'll get three keychains or necklaces of your choice.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">$100 - you'll get FIVE (!!!) keychains or necklaces of your choice.</p>
<p>If all goes well, I expect to be able to start sending out rewards in early July.</p>
<p>If I don't reach my goal, you'll still get your perks for supporting this campaign, but I'll be very sad and won't be able to afford to make as many awesome new designs, and then everybody else will be sad too. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I don't anticipate any significant risks or challenges for this project. The designs are already finished and I've sent them to my partners at The Maker Bean for prototyping. They have been doing this stuff for years, and have already proven their ability to make amazing products in a very reasonable timeline. They're also adept at troubleshooting design flaws, as I found out with my first batch! On the distribution end, I've been selling similar items in my Etsy shop for years, so I have established packaging and shipping processes already in place. </p>
<p>If the response to this campaign is really over the top, it's possible that I or The Maker Bean will get swamped with work. If that happens, it may mean some slight delays in getting out your rewards. In that case we'll prioritize the Early Bird backers, then get out the rest in batches. If necessary, I'm prepared to take on a temporary employee to help expedite reward delivery. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Whether you're backing the campaign or not, one of the best ways to help is to spread the word! You can use the IndieGoGo sharing tools, tell your friends around the free grad student pizza lunch table, tweet it, instagram it, facebook it, or leave sticky notes on the autoclave door. Help make this campaign go...viral (groan).</p>

If I don't reach my goal, you'll still get your perks for supporting this campaign, but I'll be very sad and won't be able to afford to make as many awesome new designs, and then everybody else will be sad too. 

Risks & Challenges
I don't anticipate any significant risks or challenges for this project. The designs are already finished and I've sent them to my partners at The Maker Bean for prototyping. They have been doing this stuff for years, and have already proven their ability to make amazing products in a very reasonable timeline. They're also adept at troubleshooting design flaws, as I found out with my first batch! On the distribution end, I've been selling similar items in my Etsy shop for years, so I have established packaging and shipping processes already in place. 
If the response to this campaign is really over the top, it's possible that I or The Maker Bean will get swamped with work. If that happens, it may mean some slight delays in getting out your rewards. In that case we'll prioritize the Early Bird backers, then get out the rest in batches. If necessary, I'm prepared to take on a temporary employee to help expedite reward delivery. 

Other Ways You Can Help
Whether you're backing the campaign or not, one of the best ways to help is to spread the word! You can use the IndieGoGo sharing tools, tell your friends around the free grad student pizza lunch table, tweet it, instagram it, facebook it, or leave sticky notes on the autoclave door. Help make this campaign go...viral (groan).

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Artemis is an intersectional, feminist, creative community which produces art and media to promote the stories, experiences and perspectives of underrepresented communities at the University of Southern California. Artemis became an official organization this fall, and is working to produce its first ever production to inaugurate its presence at USC. </p>
<p>This December we bring to life an all-women rehearsed reading of <i>The Tempest</i>. Many of Shakespearean plays toy with, and are fundamentally about, gender. Every play examines the power imbalance in a gendered society - and an all-women production keeps this notion of gender at the front of the audience's minds. This helps realise there are many things brought to light about Shakespeare's plays when performed in such a manner. Furthermore, in doing so we hope to celebrate Shakespeare's 400th anniversary and show how his work is still relevant and accessible today. </p>
<p>This campaign will help fund <i>The </i><i>Tempest</i>, and kick off Artemis's campaign to establish itself on campus. Your contribution means the world to our young organization and will contribute to an amazing legacy of inclusive productions.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Your donations go a long way to helping making this show the best that it can be. Funds will go to paying for the space, costumes, lighting equipment, and instruments for sound, all vital to our production. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Artemis hopes to continue to produce and promote creative endeavour and to develop a  community for students of all races, genders, and sexual orientations to engage in artistic exploration. <i>The Tempest</i> is the first project produced by Artemis, and is incredibly important for establishing ourselves as on campus. </p>

<h3>About the Littlest Finch &amp; Sticks and Stones Studio!</h3>
<p>Hello Friends! I am an independent artist out of the PNW known as Finch! Recently, in October of 2017, I opened an <a href=""http://www.etsy.com/shop/ShopStickersandStone"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Etsy shop</a> under the name Sticks and Stones Studio! The plan was to create a shop catering to all the folk out there who share my fascination with the beauty, the magic and the strangeness of the natural world through stickers! I was not quite expecting my little shop to do as well as it has, and although I feel positively<i> blessed, </i>I did not quite think through the extent of the labors associated with my shop!</p>
<p>As a<i> </i>human adult, definitely not a goblin, I do have a full time job that eats away the majority of my day time hours and then some. This does not leave a lot of time to create a lot of art, let alone print, cut, pack and send said art. What has started to happen now is that I'm spending more time cutting out stickers for orders than I am able to spend creating new designs! When I first opened the shop my plan was to offer bi-weekly sticker updates packed full of new designs for both new packs and existing packs! Unfortunately because of my job and the consistent influx of orders, I've been totally unable to find the time!</p>
<p>So I decided to do some research into ways I can automate my process a little further! Research showed me the <a href=""http://shop.cricut.com/en_us/machines/cricut-explore-air-2/cricut-explore-air-8482-2-sky-machine-ultimate-machine-set.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Cricut Explore Air 2</a> as the perfect solution to my problem! Not only will this handy machine cut out stickers, but it will also allow me to create sticker sheets! So it would both ease my process and help me expand what I'm able to offer! This would be an absolutely huge boost to my business and my ability to expand as a content creator!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What does your money go towards?</h3>
<p>I'm asking for a little more money than the actual cost of the machine so here is a break down on what that is for! I decided now was a great time to expand not just my automation abilities, but several other awesome things, such as vinyl stickers and holographic stickers! Your money will help towards building these goals.</p>
<p>-Cricut Explore Air 2 270$ + Shipping</p>
<p>-Ink for my printer! I plan to purchase approximately 2x box with CYMK 40$ 2x boxes with CYM 24$ each. Total: 128$</p>
<p>-Laminator for applying holographic tape and protective sheeting for more waterproof stickers 30$</p>
<p>-100 sheets matte vinyl sticker paper 50$ + Shipping</p>
<p>-1 30ft x 6inch roll of holographic transfer film 30$</p>
<p>-1 pack of 100 laminate sleeves 13$</p>
<p>-100$ for site fees, shipping fees and shipping supplies for perks!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I absolutely can't stress enough how this will not only be a quality of life improvement for me, but also will allow me to truly expand what I'm able to offer! Being able to fund like this will allow me to keep my prices low, rather than having them reflect in the cost of such a big investment!</p>
<p>Pricing aside this will allow me to continue to ship products quickly, as I currently try to get orders out within two business days. It will also allow me to focus more on the packing of my orders which I always put the most love possible into!</p>
<p>More time not only means better orders but time to focus on bi-weekly updates for my shop. New products I have planned such as my Crystal Oracle Deck will find time to be worked on. It will also allow me to save money for a printer upgrade so I can provide better prints as well! This investment will not only benefit my shop but my customer base as well!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Final Notes &amp; Other Ways to Help!~</strong></h3>
<p>Even if I hit 1/3 of my proposed funding it will be hugely helpful! If you can't spare money I 100% understand but would totally appreciate if you shared my campaign just so my shop continues to receive some visibility.</p>
<p>Spreading a little love through my art and stickers honestly brings me so much joy! It's one of those wonderful broke artist dreams and you guys are really helping me to achieve them. From the bottom of my heart thank you!</p>

<h3>Me and My Exhibition</h3>
<ul>
<li>My name is Sian.  I'm an illustration student from Milton Keynes, which is a town 50 miles from London, UK.  I'm fascinated by history and my degree was in Art History.</li>
<li>I've been offered a one-week solo exhibition at Milton Keynes Gallery, as part of their scheme Project Space 2012.  I'll be contributing a series of drawings, paintings and prints, illustrating scenes I've read about in local history books, and quotes by codebreakers, Land Girls and evacuees.</li>
<li>I've been a full-time student for a year, which has left me with limited finances.  The Gallery's unable to offer me a grant for this project.  I already own a lot of the raw materials, but I need to find a way to pay for some peripheral things, without which you just can't mount an exhibition.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Stories I'm Telling</h3>
<p>I'm hoping that my research and illustrations can form the basis of one of my MA projects, and perhaps become my first published children's book!</p>
<ul>
<li>Milton Keynes was founded as a new town in 1967, so it's often thought of as very modern place: glass office buildings, a shopping centre and a baffling road system.  But we have ancient ruins, mentions in the Doomsday Book... and we played this extraordinary role in WW2.</li>
<li>During WW2, the area of Bletchley was the centre of the Allies' top secret intelligence campaign.  Young people there broke Nazi codes and ciphers, shortening the War by at least two years, saving countless lives.  They weren't allowed to talk about their work until 1977.  In the fields which were later to become MK shops and residential areas, the Women's Land Army took over the agricultural labour which had to be done while male farm workers were off fighting.  And as MK is so inland, it didn't attract many bombs -- so foster families took in children evacuated from the Blitz.</li>
<li>At Bletchley Park, it wasn't all tweedy pipe-smoking professors: 3/4 of the staff were women, the average age was 19, they had a drama society and skated on the lake in winter.  People needed to be young, vigorous and passionate to be able to withstand the long hours and the immense pressure of knowing their secret work could make or break Britain's war effort.  The Land Girls weren't all the rosy-cheeked maids of propaganda posters, looking all capable with farm machinery: the girls often had no training and had to do unphotogenic jobs like rat-catching and mucking out pigs.  But they got on with it because they knew feeding the nation was vital -- and they didn't get any official thanks for their efforts until 2007, when all living Land Girls received a commemorative badge.  They were known as 'the Cinderella Service'.  I really want to illustrate the stories of all these unsung heroes, bringing their work to the attention of a new generation.</li>
<li>This is a topical project.  2012 is the centenary of the star codebreaker and father of modern computing, Alan Turing.  2012 is also apparently the last year the former Land Girls will be marching past the Cenotaph.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Where the £500 Will Go</h3>
<ul>
<li>FRAMES <br/>At the moment, I'm not able to frame my pictures.  Getting a professional picture-framer to frame my work will be prohibitively expensive, even if I can make a sponsorship deal with them. <br/>My neighbour kindly donated two big ornate antique frames and I'm going to find a third that will complement them.  There will be three large pictures, surrounded by lots of smaller pictures in plain white Ikea frames.  £8 per frame x 20 = £160.</li>
<li>PRINTING<br/>Some of my work is digital and will need to be printed professionally.  This may cost up to £200. </li>
<li>INTERACTIVE ELEMENTS<br/>The Gallery are excited to be exhibiting work that will appeal to children.  I thought I could add an interactive element in the corner -- a rug, some cushions, old teddies, books about the War, photos, replica ration books, etc.  (£50? / donations)</li>
<li>INDIEGOGO FEES<br/>If I raise the amount I need, Indiegogo take a 4% slice.  If I don't reach my target, they take 9%.  (Plus a bit more because my bank account is outside the US.)</li>
<li>LEFTOVERS: CHARITY DONATIONS<br/>Any money I have left over, I'll donate to the Bletchley Park Charitable Trust  <a href=""http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/shop/changeDonate.rhtm/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/shop/changeDonate.rhtm/</a><br/> or RABI <a href=""http://landarmy.org.uk/home.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://landarmy.org.uk/home.html</a>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What This Means to Me</h3>
<ul>
<li>I used to live in London and have a job in journalism.  I found my work dull and I felt very frustrated and unchallenged.  Last year, I made the big decision to resign, move back in with my long-suffering parents, and return to education.  I've just completed the Foundation diploma at MK College, which (along with my BA in Art History) gave me the portfolio I needed to get into the MA in Children's Book Illustration at Cambridge School of Art.  I loved every bit of my Foundation, yet I already feel that this summer project is going to be a crash course in how to be a professional artist, not just a student.  I've been dreaming about doing this MA for seven years, and always been too nervous, kept thinking of very practical, very dream-crushing reasons not to do it.  Now it's all ahead of me, I've had great feedback on my creative work so far and I feel like my career is finally getting going.  Being offered this public exhibition was a big confidence boost and I'd really love to do something I can be proud of.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<ul>
<li>Even if you can't contribute money, please let others know about my campaign -- maybe you know someone who can! Please RT the link to this page on Twitter, share on Facebook, or mention it on your own little corner of the Internets.</li>
<li>If you're quite local / London, please let me know if you have artefacts you could lend to my interactive exhibit. Be aware that you'd be risking theft or sticky fingers (although the Gallery will be insured). But if you have any objects or textiles that would suit a 1940s corner for art-loving children, get in touch.</li>
<li>If you have memories of the times I'm illustrating, or know someone who does, and would like to talk to me about your experiences, I would LOVE to hear from you. Please email sian@drawosaur.com</li>
<li>And of course, by coming to view the exhibition when it's up!</li>
</ul>

INTERACTIVE ELEMENTSThe Gallery are excited to be exhibiting work that will appeal to children.  I thought I could add an interactive element in the corner -- a rug, some cushions, old teddies, books about the War, photos, replica ration books, etc.  (£50? / donations)
INDIEGOGO FEESIf I raise the amount I need, Indiegogo take a 4% slice.  If I don't reach my target, they take 9%.  (Plus a bit more because my bank account is outside the US.)
LEFTOVERS: CHARITY DONATIONSAny money I have left over, I'll donate to the Bletchley Park Charitable Trust  http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/shop/changeDonate.rhtm/ or RABI http://landarmy.org.uk/home.html




What This Means to Me

I used to live in London and have a job in journalism.  I found my work dull and I felt very frustrated and unchallenged.  Last year, I made the big decision to resign, move back in with my long-suffering parents, and return to education.  I've just completed the Foundation diploma at MK College, which (along with my BA in Art History) gave me the portfolio I needed to get into the MA in Children's Book Illustration at Cambridge School of Art.  I loved every bit of my Foundation, yet I already feel that this summer project is going to be a crash course in how to be a professional artist, not just a student.  I've been dreaming about doing this MA for seven years, and always been too nervous, kept thinking of very practical, very dream-crushing reasons not to do it.  Now it's all ahead of me, I've had great feedback on my creative work so far and I feel like my career is finally getting going.  Being offered this public exhibition was a big confidence boost and I'd really love to do something I can be proud of.



Other Ways You Can Help

Even if you can't contribute money, please let others know about my campaign -- maybe you know someone who can! Please RT the link to this page on Twitter, share on Facebook, or mention it on your own little corner of the Internets.
If you're quite local / London, please let me know if you have artefacts you could lend to my interactive exhibit. Be aware that you'd be risking theft or sticky fingers (although the Gallery will be insured). But if you have any objects or textiles that would suit a 1940s corner for art-loving children, get in touch.
If you have memories of the times I'm illustrating, or know someone who does, and would like to talk to me about your experiences, I would LOVE to hear from you. Please email sian@drawosaur.com
And of course, by coming to view the exhibition when it's up!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>Iphonic Art</strong>, aka <em>iphoneography, iphone photography, or mobile photography</em>, is an exploding underground art movement which has grown into a global phenomenon. <strong>P1xels</strong> - a world-wide community of artists - has been home to the pioneers of the iphonic art medium since it was launched in December of 2009.</p>
<p>The talent, passion, and discipline evidenced in even the earliest batch of submissions for the first gallery show made it clear to us that we had tapped into something very exciting, special, and, most of all, enduring.</p>
<img alt=""cindhy"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://knoxbronson.com/images/indiegogo/andrewb_aerobatics.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin-left: 9px; margin-right: 9px; float: right;""/><p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em>Since the site's inception at </em><span><strong><em>pixelsatanexhibition.com</em></strong></span><em> almost three years ago, people have simply always referred us as </em><strong>""Pixels.""</strong><em> So, with the launch of the new site, we will be moving it to </em><span><strong>P1xels.com</strong></span><strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>P1xels</strong> was instrumental in defining the medium itself in these early days: where other sites allowed (and still do) off-device editing, we insisted work be shot with an iPhone, processed solely on the tiny iPhone screen with existing photo apps. In other words, we insisted that the device itself define the medium. </p>
<p><strong>As Henri Matisse once said, <strong>""Much of the beauty that arises in art comes from the struggle an artist wages with his limited medium</strong>.<strong>"" </strong></strong></p>

<p><strong>Iphonic art</strong> is something new: just <strong>look</strong> at the pictures. They will <strong>tell</strong> you.</p>
<p><strong>P1xels</strong> is, indeed, the site of record for the iphonic art movement, a pressure cooker for the rapid evolution of this wonderful new visual form of <em><strong>m</strong></em><strong><em>agical</em><em> realism.</em></strong><em> </em></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">“Our fine arts were developed, their types and uses were established, in times very different from the present, by men whose power of action upon things was insignificant in comparison with ours.

<p>This has been an amazing journey. I had no idea what I was getting into when I launched the site way back when. I just wanted to do the Giorgi show and get some of my and Maia Panos's pictures on the gallery wall. No thoughts or plans beyond that. </p>
<p>But something happened, not anticipated at <strong>all</strong>: I fell in love with the work that came in. And the artists. And the medium. Maia and I used to sit together and look at the work coming in and just marvel at the rapid evolution of the medium. Everybody was looking at what everybody else was doing (this is still happening) and learning and experimenting and pushing themselves. P1xels was and is the lab, the crucible for the whole movement.</p>
<p>And so it began.<em> Like a runaway train.</em></p>
<p>We have never sought development money before now, focusing, rather, on the art and the artists. Everything we've done, we've done with virtually no money: passion, stubbornness, and more than a few would say a bit of insanity have been the driving forces behind our accomplishments.</p>
<p>This, I believe without doubt, is what has made P1xels the pre-eminent iphonic art site in the world. But fear not: money will not spoil P1xels; P1xels has been its own crucible for us as well. We know where we are going.</p>

I ask you to be a part of it. It is still a young art form. Many fine artists have emerged; none are household names. <strong>Yet</strong>. It remains our mission to continue bringing forth and promoting these pioneering artists and their work.</p>

Iphonic Art, aka iphoneography, iphone photography, or mobile photography, is an exploding underground art movement which has grown into a global phenomenon. P1xels - a world-wide community of artists - has been home to the pioneers of the iphonic art medium since it was launched in December of 2009.
The talent, passion, and discipline evidenced in even the earliest batch of submissions for the first gallery show made it clear to us that we had tapped into something very exciting, special, and, most of all, enduring.
Since the site's inception at pixelsatanexhibition.com almost three years ago, people have simply always referred us as ""Pixels."" So, with the launch of the new site, we will be moving it to P1xels.com.
P1xels was instrumental in defining the medium itself in these early days: where other sites allowed (and still do) off-device editing, we insisted work be shot with an iPhone, processed solely on the tiny iPhone screen with existing photo apps. In other words, we insisted that the device itself define the medium. 
As Henri Matisse once said, ""Much of the beauty that arises in art comes from the struggle an artist wages with his limited medium.""

Iphonic art is something new: just look at the pictures. They will tell you.
P1xels is, indeed, the site of record for the iphonic art movement, a pressure cooker for the rapid evolution of this wonderful new visual form of magical realism. 
“Our fine arts were developed, their types and uses were established, in times very different from the present, by men whose power of action upon things was insignificant in comparison with ours. But the amazing growth of our techniques, the adaptability and precision they have attained, the ideas and habits they are creating, make it a certainty that profound changes are impending in the ancient craft of the Beautiful.”

A Final Word
Knox here.
This has been an amazing journey. I had no idea what I was getting into when I launched the site way back when. I just wanted to do the Giorgi show and get some of my and Maia Panos's pictures on the gallery wall. No thoughts or plans beyond that. 
But something happened, not anticipated at all: I fell in love with the work that came in. And the artists. And the medium. Maia and I used to sit together and look at the work coming in and just marvel at the rapid evolution of the medium. Everybody was looking at what everybody else was doing (this is still happening) and learning and experimenting and pushing themselves. P1xels was and is the lab, the crucible for the whole movement.
And so it began. Like a runaway train.
We have never sought development money before now, focusing, rather, on the art and the artists. Everything we've done, we've done with virtually no money: passion, stubbornness, and more than a few would say a bit of insanity have been the driving forces behind our accomplishments.
This, I believe without doubt, is what has made P1xels the pre-eminent iphonic art site in the world. But fear not: money will not spoil P1xels; P1xels has been its own crucible for us as well. We know where we are going.
Almost three years down the road, I still believe iphonic art to be the most vibrant and exciting new art medium on the planet. I ask you to be a part of it. It is still a young art form. Many fine artists have emerged; none are household names. Yet. It remains our mission to continue bringing forth and promoting these pioneering artists and their work.
Please join us.
Thank you.
